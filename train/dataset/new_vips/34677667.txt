Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a clinical syndrome of
life-threatening inflammation caused by an excessive, prolonged and ineffective
immune response. An increasing number of HLH cases is recognized in Poland, but
the genetic causes of familial HLH (FHL) have not been reported. We investigated 
the molecular genetics and associated outcomes of pediatric patients who met HLH 
criteria. We studied 54 patients with HLH, 36 of whom received genetic studies.
Twenty-five patients were subjected to direct sequencing of the PRF1, UNC13D,
STX11, XIAP and SH2D1A genes. Additionally, 11 patients were subjected to
targeted next-generation sequencing. In our study group, 17 patients (31%) were
diagnosed with primary HLH, with bi-allelic FHL variants identified in 13 (36%)
patients whereas hemizygous changes were identified in 4 patients with X-linked
lymphoproliferative diseases. In addition, one patient was diagnosed with
X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection and
neoplasia due to a hemizygous MAGT1 variant; another newborn was diagnosed with
auto-inflammatory syndrome caused by MVK variants. The majority (65%) of FHL
patients carried UNC13D pathogenic variants, whereas PRF1 variants occurred in
two patients. Novel variants in UNC13D, PRF1 and XIAP were detected. Epstein-Barr
virus was the most common trigger noted in 23 (65%) of the patients with
secondary HLH. In three patients with secondary HLH, heterozygous variants of FHL
genes were found. Overall survival for the entire study group was 74% with a
median of 3.6 years of follow-up. Our results highlight the diversity of
molecular causes of primary HLH in Poland.
