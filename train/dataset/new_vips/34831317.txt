CD46 is the main receptor for complement protein C3 and plays an important role
in adaptive immune responses. CD46 genetic variants are associated with
susceptibility to several infectious and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, CD46 
function can be subverted by HIV-1 to evade attack by complement, a strategy
shared by viruses of other families. We sought to determine the association
between CD46 gene variants and HIV-1 acquired through intravenous drug use (IDU) 
and sexual routes (n = 823). Study subjects were of European ancestry and were
HIV-1 infected (n = 438) or exposed but seronegative (n = 387). Genotyping of the
rs2796265 SNP located in the CD46 gene region was done by allele-specific
real-time PCR. A meta-analysis merging IDU and sexual cohorts indicates that the 
minor genotype (CC) was associated with increased resistance to HIV-1 infection
OR = 0.2, 95% CI (0.07-0.61), p = 0.004. The HIV-1-protective genotype is
correlated with reduced CD46 expression and alterations in the ratio of CD46 mRNA
splicing isoforms.
