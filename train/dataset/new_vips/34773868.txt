Influenza NS1 is a promising anti-influenza target, considering its conserved and
druggable structure, and key function in influenza replication and pathogenesis. 
Notwithstanding, target identification and validation, strengthened by
experimental data, are lacking. Here, we further explored our previously designed
structure-based antiviral rationale directed to highly conserved druggable NS1
regions across a broad spectrum of influenza A viruses. We aimed to identify
NS1-mutated viruses exhibiting a reduced growth phenotype and/or an altered cell 
apoptosis profile. We found that NS1 mutations Y171A, K175A (consensus druggable 
pocket 1), W102A (consensus druggable pocket 3), Q121A and G184P (multiple
consensus druggable pockets) - located at hot spots amenable for pharmacological 
modulation - significantly impaired A(H1N1)pdm09 virus replication, in vitro.
This is the first time that NS1-K175A, -W102A, and -Q121A mutations are
characterized. Our map-and-mutate strategy provides the basis to establish the
NS1 as a promising target using a rationale with a higher resilience to
resistance development.
