Worldwide, Verticillium wilt is among the major harmful diseases in cotton
production, causing substantial reduction in yields. While this disease has been 
extensively researched at the molecular level of the pathogen, the molecular
basis of V. dahliae host response association is yet to be thoroughly
investigated. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was carried out on V. dahliae
infected two Gossypium hirsutum L. cultivars, Xinluzao-36 (susceptible) and
Zhongzhimian-2 (disease resistant) for 0 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h time intervals. 
Statistical analysis revealed that V. dahliae infection elicited differentially
expressed gene responses in the two cotton varieties, but more intensely in the
susceptible cultivar than in the resistant cultivars. Data analysis revealed 4241
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the LT variety across the three
treatment timepoints whereas 7657 in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the
Vd592 variety across the three treatment timepoints. Six genes were randomly
selected for qPCR validation of the RNA-Seq data. Numerous genes encompassed in
disease resistance and defense mechanisms were identified. Further, RNA-Seq
dataset was utilized in construction of the weighted gene co-expression network
and 11 hub genes were identified, that encode for different proteins associated
with lignin and immune response, Auxin response factor, cell wall and vascular
development, microtubule, Ascorbate transporter, Serine/threonine kinase and
Immunity and drought were identified. This significant research will aid in
advancing crucial knowledge on virus-host interactions and identify key genes
intricate in G. hirsutum L. resistance to V. dahliae infection.
