OBJECTIVE: 窶グral verrucous squamous cell carcinoma or oral verrucous carcinoma
(OVC) is a rare verrucous variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which
accounts for 2 to 12% of all oral carcinomas. Oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH) is
clinically similar to OVC and has been proposed to be a precursor lesion of OVC. 
Etiopathogenesis of both lesions is still inconspicuous. Oncogenic viruses such
as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been reported to 
be associated with some cases of OSCC, and we hypothesized that it may act as a
causative agent of these verrucous lesions. This study aimed to investigate
frequency of HPV and EBV infections in OVC and OVH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 窶ザsing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a total of 35
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, including 27 OVC samples 
and 8 OVH samples, were investigated for HPV and EBV infection. HeLa and B95-8
cell lines were used as positive controls of HPV and EBV PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: 窶アll OVC and OVH samples show a positivity to GAPDH, whereas neither HPV
nor EBV PCR products was detected in both OVC and OVH samples.
CONCLUSIONS: 窶オn summary, our study demonstrated that HPV and EBV are not
involved in pathogenesis of OVC and OVH. Other etiologic factors contributing to 
OVC and OVH need to be further clarified.
