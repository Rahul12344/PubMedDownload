BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of being infected with
SARS-CoV-2; while PCR test remains gold standard for diagnosis of COVID19
infection, antigen based rapid detection tests have been recently approved by
OMS.
METHODS: We pooled data on occupational surveillance of 6397 asymptomatic HCW and
other employees who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the University
Hospital in Bologna using rapid antigen test between November 16, 2020 and
January 29, 2021.
FINDINGS: A total of 17,993 rapid tests were performed, of which 704 for contact 
with an infected person and 17,289 for voluntary screening. Among 17,732 tests
with valid results, 87 tested positive (0.49%) and 17 weakly positive (0.10%).
The sensitivity of the antigenic test was 88.6% (81.1-96.1), the specificity was 
93.4% (89-97.8), the positive predictive value, given a prevalence of infection
of 42.1%, was 90.7% (84.8-96.6).
