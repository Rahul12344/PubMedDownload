BACKGROUND: Infants ≤90 days old exhibit nonspecific signs of infection, even in 
cases of serious bacterial infection (SBI).
METHODS: This prospective study included infants aged ≤90 days hospitalized for
fever from June 2017 to August 2019. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested using
multiplex real-time PCR, and 16S ribosomal RNA analysis of whole blood was
performed to determine causative microorganisms. Data pertaining to inflammatory 
markers, maximum body temperature (BT), and respiratory symptoms of infants and
their cohabiting families were collected at admission.
RESULTS: A total of 110 infants were enrolled (age range: 9-90 days), 17 (15.5%) 
of whom presented with SBIs. White blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) were significantly higher in patients with SBIs than in those
without, although maximum BT did not significantly differ between the SBI and
non-SBI groups (n=93). One or more viruses were detected in 82 (74.5%) infants.
Viruses were detected more frequently in infants with respiratory symptoms than
in those without respiratory (P=0.038), and patients with SBIs experienced
significantly less respiratory symptoms than those with non-SBI (P=0.049).
Moreover, viruses were more often detected in infants from cohabiting families
with respiratory symptoms than in those whose family members did not exhibit
respiratory symptoms (P=0.0018).
CONCLUSION: WBC, and ANC were significantly higher, and experienced respiratory
symptoms were less in infants ≤90 days old with SBIs than in those without.
Detection of microorganisms from nasopharyngeal by multiplex real-time PCR swabs 
could not be judged as SBI or non-SBI.
