Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents: A Look Into Modern Single
Tablet Regimens.

Lee C, Sapasap J, LaRochelle J, Smith RO, Badowski ME.

Single tablet regimens (STRs) have simplified antiretroviral therapy (ART) over
the years in the adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population. However,
there is still a prevalent need to simplify regimens in children and adolescents 
living with HIV. Finding the optimal regimen requires a multi-factorial approach 
due to their complex pharmacokinetic profiles throughout childhood and the
challenges and limitations of medication non-adherence in the pediatric
population. These challenges include pill size, available formulations,
palatability, and caregiver health literacy, which can all affect the proper
administration of medications. The complexity of this population implies the
importance of customizing everyone's antiretroviral regimen so that the patient
and family can successfully adhere to the therapy. The current recommendations
for ART in the adult and pediatric populations are similar, yet the use of STRs
are limited. The goal of this review was to assess current data on available STRs
and determine their utility as ART in the pediatric population.
