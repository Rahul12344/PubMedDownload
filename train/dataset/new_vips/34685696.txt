As of September 2021, twenty-one anti-COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in the
world. Their utilization will expedite an end to the current pandemic. Besides
the usual vaccine formats that include inactivated viruses (eight approved
vaccines) and protein-based vaccines (four approved vaccines), three new formats 
have been validated: recombinant adenovirus (six approved vaccines), DNA (one
approved vaccine), and messenger RNA (mRNA, two approved vaccines). The latter
was the fastest (authorized in 2020 in the EU, the USA, and Switzerland). Most
Western countries have reserved or use the protein vaccines, the adenovirus
vaccines, and mRNA vaccines. I describe here the different vaccine formats in the
context of COVID-19, detail the three formats that are chiefly reserved or used
in Europe, Canada, and the USA, and discuss why the mRNA vaccines appear to be
the superior format.
