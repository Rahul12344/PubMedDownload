Waterborne epidemics of human hepatitis virus A and E (HAV and HEV) have been
reported worldwide. Molecular biology techniques, such as reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have been widely used to detect the two
hepatitis viruses. However, comparative studies of various types of samples are
needed, and different environmental factors, including the low copy pathogens,
presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample, unknown non-specific reaction with
template, and sequence diversity leading to new variants in viruses, should be
considered. In addition, standard positive material is required to determine the 
accuracy of the PCR and should be able to distinguish between false and real
positives. In this study, we developed RT-PCR primer sets and optimised standard 
templates for HAV and HEV detection to address the above concerns associated with
test sensitivity and possible PCR inhibition. Finally, previously reported
diagnostic methods of HAV and HEV were compared and an applicability test using
groundwater was performed. The nested RT-PCR developed in this study is expected 
to contribute to assess water safety by monitoring HAV and HEV in non-disinfected
water, like groundwater.
