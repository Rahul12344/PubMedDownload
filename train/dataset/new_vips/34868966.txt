Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) THOR (Lnc-THOR) is expressed in testis and multiple 
human malignancies. Lnc-THOR association with IGF2BP1 (IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 
1) is essential for stabilization and transcription of IGF2BP1 targeted mRNAs. We
tested its expression and potential functions in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). In primary NSCLC cells and established cell lines, Lnc-THOR shRNA or
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) downregulated IGF2BP1 target mRNAs (IGF2,
Gli1, Myc and SOX9), inhibiting cell viability, growth, proliferation, migration 
and invasion. Significant apoptosis activation was detected in
Lnc-THOR-silenced/-KO NSCLC cells. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Lnc-THOR
upregulated IGF2BP1 mRNA targets and enhanced NSCLC cell proliferation, migration
and invasion. RNA-immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assay results confirmed
the direct binding between Lnc-THOR and IGF2BP1 protein in NSCLC cells. Lnc-THOR 
silencing and overexpression were ineffective in IGF2BP1-KO NSCLC cells. Forced
IGF2BP1 overexpression failed to rescue Lnc-THOR-KO NSCLC cells. In vivo,
intratumoral injection of Lnc-THOR shRNA adeno-associated virus potently
inhibited A549 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. At last we show that Lnc-THOR
is overexpressed in multiple NSCLC tissues and established/primary NSCLC cells.
Collectively, these results highlighted the ability of Lnc-THOR in promoting
NSCLC cell growth by associating with IGF2BP1, suggesting that Lnc-THOR
represents a promising therapeutic target of NSCLC.
