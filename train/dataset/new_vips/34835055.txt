Retroviral infection delivers an RNA genome into the cytoplasm that serves as the
template for the synthesis of a linear double-stranded DNA copy by the viral
reverse transcriptase. Within the nucleus this linear DNA gives rise to
extrachromosomal circular forms, and in a key step of the life cycle is inserted 
into the host genome to form the integrated provirus. The unintegrated DNA forms,
like those of DNAs entering cells by other means, are rapidly loaded with
nucleosomes and heavily silenced by epigenetic histone modifications. This review
summarizes our present understanding of the silencing machinery for the DNAs of
the mouse leukemia viruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We consider
the potential impact of the silencing on virus replication, on the sensing of the
virus by the innate immune system, and on the formation of latent proviruses. We 
also speculate on the changeover to high expression from the integrated
proviruses in permissive cell types, and briefly consider the silencing of
proviruses even after integration in embryonic stem cells and other
developmentally primitive cell types.
