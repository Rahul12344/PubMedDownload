BACKGROUND: Accurate population estimates of disease incidence and burden are
needed to set appropriate public health policy. The capture-recapture (C-R)
method combines data from multiple sources to provide better estimates than is
possible using single sources.
METHODS: Data were derived from clinical virology test results and from an
influenza vaccine effectiveness study from seasons 2016-2017 to 2018-2019. The
Petersen C-R method was used to estimate the population size of influenza cases; 
these estimates were then used to calculate adult influenza hospitalization
burden using a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) multiplier
method.
RESULTS: Over all seasons, 343 influenza cases were reported in the clinical
database, and 313 in the research database. Fifty-nine cases (17%) reported in
the clinical database were not captured in the research database, and 29 (9%)
cases in the research database were not captured in the clinical database.
Influenza hospitalizations were higher among vaccinated (58%) than the
unvaccinated (35%) in the current season and were similar among unvaccinated
(51%) and vaccinated (49%) in the previous year. Completeness of the influenza
hospitalization capture was estimated to be 76%. The incidence rates for
influenza hospitalizations varied by age and season and averaged 307-309
cases/100,000 adult population annually.
CONCLUSION: Using C-R methods with more than one database, along with a
multiplier method with adjustments improves the population estimates of influenza
disease burden compared with relying on a single-data source.
