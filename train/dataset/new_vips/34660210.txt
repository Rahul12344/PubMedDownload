India is ranked 120 among 165 nations with respect to sustainable development and
critically suffers from insufficient waste treatment provisions and amenities.
And the abrupt occurrence of the COVID-19 virus has aggravated the issue of
managing of medical waste in India, manifolds. As a result, the safe disposal of 
a huge volume of hazardous medical waste has become a top priority. This
conceptual study evaluates India's management of medical waste during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article aims to highlight the inadequacies 
in India's implementation of the BMW 2016 standards by a synthesis of multiple
agency reports (government and non-government) and data obtained directly from
the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The findings indicate that India is
well behind in terms of COVID-19 waste management and requires comprehensive
monitoring and implementation systems to enable the achievement of SDGs related
to environmental health.
