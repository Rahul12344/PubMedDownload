The role of general transcription factor TFIIB in transcription extends well
beyond its evolutionarily conserved function in initiation. Chromatin
localization studies demonstrating binding of TFIIB to both the 5' and 3' ends of
genes in a diverse set of eukaryotes strongly suggested a rather unexpected role 
of the factor in termination. TFIIB indeed plays a role in termination of
transcription. TFIIB occupancy of the 3' end is possibly due to its interaction
with the termination factors residing there. Interaction of the promoter-bound
TFIIB with factors occupying the 3' end of a gene may be the basis of
transcription-dependent gene looping. The proximity of the terminator-bound
factors with the promoter in a gene loop has the potential to terminate
promoter-initiated upstream anti-sense transcription thereby conferring promoter 
directionality. TFIIB, therefore, is emerging as a factor with pleiotropic roles 
in the transcription cycle. This could be the reason for preferential targeting
of TFIIB by viruses. Further studies are needed to understand the critical role
of TFIIB in viral pathogenesis in the context of its newly identified roles in
termination, gene looping and promoter directionality.
