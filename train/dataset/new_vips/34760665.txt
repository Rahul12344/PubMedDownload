Kaposi sarcoma (KS) was first described by Moritz Kaposi as a vascular tumor that
mainly involves the skin but can affect any organ system. It is typically an
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome defining illness but has emerged as a neoplasm
also seen in patients on immunosuppressive therapy. Few KS cases have been
reported in the literature associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. We report
the case of a 39-year-old male with well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented to the hospital with new skin
lesions shortly after the initiation of vedolizumab to treat his refractory UC.
Immunohistochemistry of the skin lesions was consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma
secondary to human herpesvirus-8. This is a rare case of iatrogenic KS in a
well-controlled HIV patient secondary to immunosuppressive therapy.
