Background: Aberrant growth and polarization of microglia are critical for
pathological initiation and progression of neurodegenerative conditions like
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular signals that govern the
outgrowth of microglia have not yet been fully determined. Spindle pole body
component 25 (SPC25) is an important part for forming NDC80 complex, which plays 
a key role in the assembly of the microtubule-binding domain of kinetochores.
Nevertheless, the role of SPC25 in microglial growth during neurodegeneration has
not been described before, and was thus addressed in the current study.
Methods: We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype PHP.B carrying
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for SPC25 (shSPC25) under a microglia-specific TMEM119 
promoter (AAV-pTMEM-shSPC25). Serotype PHP.B allowed the virus to cross
blood-brain barrier, while TMEM119 promoter allowed specific targeting microglia 
in vitro and in vivo. We intravenously administrated AAV-pTMEM-shSPC25 to
AD-prone APP/PS1 male and female mice and determined this effect on microglia
proliferation and mouse behavior.
Results: Depletion of SPC25 did not alter polarization of microglia cell
polarization in vitro. On the other hand, AD-prone APP/PS1 mice that had received
AAV-pTMEM-shSPC25 significantly decreased SPC25 levels in microglia and
attenuated microglia proliferation, resulting in significant improvement of the
performance of the mice in behavior tests.
Conclusions: Specific depletion of SPC25 in microglia may prevent AD development 
through suppression of microglia outgrowth. SPC25 may be a promising novel target
for preventing AD through microglia.
