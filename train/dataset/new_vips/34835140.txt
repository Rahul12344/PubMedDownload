The aim of this review is to follow the history of studies on endemiv arboviruses
and the diseases they cause which were detected in the Czech lands (Bohemia,
Moravia and Silesia (i.e., the Czech Republic)). The viruses involve tick-borne
encephalitis, West Nile and Usutu flaviviruses; the Sindbis alphavirus; Ťahyňa,
Batai, Lednice and Sedlec bunyaviruses; the Uukuniemi phlebovirus; and the Tribeč
orbivirus. Arboviruses temporarily imported from abroad to the Czech Republic
have been omitted. This brief historical review includes a bibliography of all
relevant papers.
