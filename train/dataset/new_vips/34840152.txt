The Legality and Ethics of Mandating COVID-19 Vaccination.

Largent EA, Miller FG.

In light of ongoing concerns in the US that COVID-19 vaccine uptake is stagnating
and that cases remain high amongst the unvaccinated, there is growing interest in
increasing uptake by mandating vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine mandates must be
understood and assessed in terms of who is requiring vaccination and who is
required to be vaccinated. This essay considers the legal and ethical
implications of states mandating vaccination for children and adults, as well as 
of employers mandating vaccines for employees. We conclude that COVID-19 vaccine 
mandates are legally and ethically permissible.
