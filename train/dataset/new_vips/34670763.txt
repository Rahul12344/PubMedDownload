OBJECTIVES: Community health workers (CHWs) played important roles in
supplementing scarce healthcare workforce in Sierra Leone during the Ebola
outbreak, causing the government to launch the National Community Health Worker
Policy 2016-2020. This study evaluated this ambitious policy and examined CHWs'
sustainability through their job satisfaction and the underlying factors to
inform new policy recommendations, especially the implication for COVID-19
containment.
DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach applying structured questionnaires and
semistructured interviews.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 188 CHWs in Bombali District (key Ebola-stricken areas)
of Sierra Leone, 184 of them participated in follow-up interviews.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative and qualitative elements
were triangulated to improve robustness of investigation: job satisfaction was
measured by the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), and factors
associated with job satisfaction were identified through thematic analysis and
multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: The MSQ score of CHWs in Sierra Leone was 65.09, extremely low even
among low-income and middle-income countries. Five themes (grouped from 16
subthemes) emerged through the semistructured interviews and were tested
quantitatively. Payment was CHWs' top concern. Low stipend and payment tardiness 
were significantly associated with dissatisfaction. Those with Ebola experience
were 5.20 times (95% CI 1.51 to 17.95, p=0.009) more likely to be dissatisfied.
This study also found that working conditions, medical material supplies and
career development were far from what the CHW policy promised. CHWs' commitment
was the only 'positive' theme, and their intrinsic job satisfaction (mean=3.61)
was much higher than the extrinsic job satisfaction (mean=2.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Some critical components of the 2016 National Community Health
Worker Policy, aiming to promote CHWs and strengthen primary healthcare, have
severe shortfalls in practice. The Sierra Leone government should address the
underlying factors that have impaired CHWs' job satisfaction to ensure
sustainability of its CHW network, especially during the combat against COVID-19.
