Multiple myeloma accounts for 1% of all new cancers worldwide. It is the second
most common haematological malignancy and has a low five-year survival rate
(53.2%). Myeloma remains an incurable disease and is caused by the growth of
malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Current anti-myeloma therapies
(conventional chemotherapies, immunomodulatory drugs i.e., thalidomide and its'
analogues, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and radiotherapy)
initially substantially debulk tumour burden, but after a period of remission
'plateau phase' disease invariably relapses due to tumour recrudescence from foci
of minimal residual disease (MRD) and accumulating drug resistance. Therefore,
there is a compelling clinical need for the development of novel treatment
regimens to target MRD and effectively eliminate all remaining tumour cells. This
review will discuss the potential use of oncolytic virus (OV) therapies in the
treatment of myeloma. Specifically, it will focus on preclinical studies using
DNA viruses (adenovirus (Ad), vaccinia virus (VV), myxoma virus (MYXV), and
herpes simplex virus (HSV)), RNA viruses (reovirus (reo), coxsackie virus,
measles virus (MV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV)), and on four types of viruses (VV, reo, MV-NIS and
VSV-IFNÎ²-NIS) that have been assessed clinically in a small number of myeloma
patients.
