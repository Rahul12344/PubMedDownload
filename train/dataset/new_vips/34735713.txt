For a very long time, viral infections have been considered as one of the most
important causes of death and disability around the world. Through the viral
infection, viruses as small pathogens enter the host cells and use hosts'
biosynthesis machinery to replicate and collect infectious lineages. Moreover,
they can modify hosts' metabolic pathways in order to their own purposes.
Nowadays (in 2019-2020), the most famous type of viral infection which was caused
by a novel type of coronavirus is called COVID-19 disease. It has claimed the
lives of many people around the world and is a very serious threat to health.
Since investigations of the effects of viruses on host metabolism using
metabolomics tools may have given focuses on novel appropriate treatments, in the
current review the authors highlighted the virus-host metabolic interactions and 
metabolomics perspective in COVID-19.
