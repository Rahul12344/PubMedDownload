INTRODUCTION: The Southeast U.S. and Georgia in particular are disproportionally 
affected by HIV. A major barrier in Georgia to meeting the goals of Ending the
HIV Epidemic in the U.S is lack of proximity to HIV care. To address this and
other barriers, Georgia implemented a comprehensive HIV telehealth system,
including telemedicine to provide remote care through clients' local medical
homes. In addition, a telementoring program (Project Extension for Community
Healthcare Outcomes) was initiated to strengthen the HIV provider workforce in
Georgia.
METHODS: A total of 60 telemedicine solutions have been deployed in Georgia,
including 8 during the COVID-19 pandemic, to expand HIV care access in 12 of 18
Georgia health districts. Community providers were also able to access Project
Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes for remote training and consultation.
Data were collected with CAREWare to assess HIV viral suppression among Ryan
White HIV/AIDS Program Part B clients accessing telemedicine compared with Ryan
that among White HIV/AIDS Program clients overall.
RESULTS: In all, 6,977 Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients were seen during 2020.
Of these, 1,041 had a telehealth visit, of whom 1,035 (99.4%) were prescribed
antiretroviral therapy, and 951 (91.4%) were virally suppressed. Results were
comparable with those of Georgia Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part B clients,
overall.
CONCLUSIONS: In Georgia, HIV telehealth has been successful at bridging gaps in
patient care and in training local providers to offer comprehensive HIV care.
Continuing challenges include integration of electronic health records with the
telehealth platform, privacy and data security, equitable reimbursement, and lack
of digital devices and Internet service access among some rural patients.
