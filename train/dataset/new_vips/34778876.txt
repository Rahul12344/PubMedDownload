Bile acids (BAs) are evolutionally conserved molecules synthesized in the liver
from cholesterol to facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. In the 
intestines, where enteric viruses replicate, BAs also act as signaling molecules 
that modulate various biological functions via activation of specific receptors
and cell signaling pathways. To date, BAs present either pro-viral or anti-viral 
effects for the replication of enteric viruses in vivo and in vitro. In this
review, we summarized current information on biosynthesis, transportation and
metabolism of BAs and the role of BAs in replication of enteric caliciviruses,
rotaviruses, and coronaviruses. We also discussed the application of BAs for cell
culture adaptation of fastidious enteric caliciviruses and control of virus
infection, which may provide novel insights into the development of antivirals
and/or disinfectants for enteric viruses.
