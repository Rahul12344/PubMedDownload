Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been object of debate in the scientific
community since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. This mechanism of
transmission could arise from virus-laden aerosol released by infected
individuals and it is influenced by several factors. Among these, the
concentration and size distribution of virus-laden particles play an important
role. The knowledge regarding aerosol transmission increases as new evidence is
collected in different studies, even if it is not yet available a standard
protocol regarding air sampling and analysis, which can create difficulties in
the interpretation and application of results. This work reports a systematic
review of current knowledge gained by 73 published papers on experimental
determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air comparing different environments:
outdoors, indoor hospitals and healthcare settings, and public community indoors.
Selected papers furnished 77 datasets: outdoor studies (9/77, 11.7%) and indoor
studies (68/77. 88.3%). The indoor datasets in hospitals were the vast majority
(58/68, 85.3%), and the remaining (10/68, 14.7%) were classified as community
indoors. The fraction of studies having positive samples, as well as positivity
rates (i.e. ratios between positive and total samples) are significantly larger
in hospitals compared to the other typologies of sites. Contamination of surfaces
was more frequent (in indoor datasets) compared to contamination of air samples; 
however, the average positivity rate was lower compared to that of air.
Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air were highly variables and, on average,
lower in outdoors compared to indoors. Among indoors, concentrations in community
indoors appear to be lower than those in hospitals and healthcare settings.
