We herein report four patients with community-acquired respiratory virus (CRV)
infection. Although they had no history of contact with any individual with
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they were suspected of having COVID-19 based on
findings of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. Among the four
patients, two were infected with rhinovirus, one with metapneumovirus, and one
with influenza A. Their chest CT findings were similar to those of COVID-19
patients reported in previous studies. Both CRV infection and COVID-19 can show
various patterns on chest CT. CRV infection is thus indistinguishable from
COVID-19 based on CT findings alone.
