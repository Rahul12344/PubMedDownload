Introduction: pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) can compromise the 3rd 95-95-95
global target for viral load suppression. The high complexity and cost of
genotyping assays limits routine testing in many resource limited settings (RLS).
We assessed the performance of a rapid HIV-1 drug resistance assay, the Pan
Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) assay when screening for
significant HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) such as K65R, K103NS, M184VI, 
Y181C and G190A. Methods: we used previously generated amplicons from a
cross-sectional study conducted between October 2018 and February 2020 of HIV-1
infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve or those reinitiating 1st line ART
(18 years or older). The performance of the PANDAA assay in screening K65R,
K103NS, M184VI, Y181C, and G190A mutations compared to the reference assay,
Sanger sequencing was evaluated by Cohen´s kappa coefficient on Stata version 14 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
Results: one hundred and twenty samples previously characterized by Sanger
sequencing were assessed using PANDAA. PDR was found in 14% (17/120). PDR to
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was higher at 13%
(16/120) than PDR to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 3%
(3/120). The PANDAA assay showed a strong agreement with the reference assay,
i.e. Sanger sequencing for all five target DRMs (kappa (95%CI); 0.93 (0.78-0.98))
and NNRTI DRMs (kappa (95%CI); 0.93 (0.77-0.980), and a perfect agreement for
NRTI DRMs (kappa (95%CI); 1.00 (0.54-1.00)).
Conclusion: the PANDAA assay is a simple and rapid method to identify significant
HIV DRMs in plasma samples as an alternative to Sanger sequencing in many RLS.
