PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected health care systems worldwide,
resulting in critical shortages of essential items and materials. The available
guidelines are of little use for cancer hospitals in low-income and
low-middle-income countries. They have been designed for community hospitals
serving in a centralized health care network. This study aimed to draft and field
test a framework to establish a list of essential supplies that should be
stockpiled for subsequent waves of the COVID-19 virus by a tertiary care cancer
hospital in a low-middle-income country.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model was formulated using the consumption trends during
the peak month of the first wave of COVID-19 infection to compile a list of
essential materials and supplies. Furthermore, costing analyses were conducted to
determine the financial benefits of stockpiling.
RESULTS: A proposed list of items to stockpile, including personal protective
equipment, radiology supplies, laboratory reagents, medication, and oxygen, was
shared with the hospital administration. However, the hospital administration
only accepted the proposals for stockpiling personal protective equipment and
oxygen.
CONCLUSION: This paper provides a framework and strategies that cancer hospitals 
and health care systems can modify and use as per individual, institutional
requirements and specifications for stockpiling essential items during the
COVID-19 or other similar pandemics.
