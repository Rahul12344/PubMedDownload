Preterm birth (birth <37 completed weeks' gestation) is common, affecting 10.6%
of live births globally (nearly 15 million babies per year). Having a new baby
admitted to a neonatal unit often triggers stress and anxiety for parents. This
paper seeks to explore experiences of preterm birth via Twitter. The
intermingling of COVID-19 restrictions and World Prematurity Day allows for an
understanding of both the additional stresses incurred as a consequence of the
pandemic and the more "everyday" experiences in the NICU and beyond. The content 
analysis of the data included 3161 tweets. Three themes were identified: 1.
COVID-19 was not the only trauma; 2. Raising awareness, especially World
Prematurity Day; and, 3. Baby milestones. These themes highlight the multi-level 
challenges faced by parents of premature babies and the healthcare professionals 
involved in their care. The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions
imposed on parents' contact with their babies have resulted in immense emotional 
strain for families. The reported COVID-19 pandemic "baby blind spot" appears to 
particularly impact this group of babies. Improved understanding of the lived
experiences of preterm babies and their families should inform greater awareness 
and improved support.
