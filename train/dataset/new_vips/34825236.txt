In the recent past, we observed an increased risk of cancer in the population
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) owing to the development of
antiretroviral therapies that decreased mortality caused by HIV-specific
infections. This particularly fragile population is frequently excluded from
clinical trials, and up-to-date recommendations for these patients are lacking.
Only few cases of patients with HIV suffering from cancer and undergoing
first-line immunotherapy have been reported so far. Here, we report the largest
known study of patients with HIV with NSCLC (five patients) undergoing first-line
immunotherapy by pembrolizumab, after CANCERVIH group selection. Our results are 
consistent with those of previous case reports concerning safety of immunotherapy
in patients with HIV, revealing no severe or fatal toxicity, opportunistic
infections, or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Moreover,
pembrolizumab did not seem to modify HIV viral parameters. We also evaluated the 
effectiveness of immunotherapy in these HIV-immunosuppressed patients: the
average survival was 9.8 months, with three patients having rapid progression and
two partial response. Nevertheless, besides safety and drug-to-drug interactions,
the effectiveness of first-line immunotherapy in people living with HIV needs to 
be supported by larger studies.
