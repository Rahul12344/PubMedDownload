Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease and anti-neutrophil
cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis are the main causes of
pulmonary-renal syndrome (PRS). The concurrence of both ANCA - myeloperoxidase
(MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) - and anti-GBM antibodies has been described,
although positivity for all three antibodies has rarely been reported. The
natural history of triple-positive patients as well as the best therapeutic
approach remains unknown. We describe a case of an 80-year-old woman that
presented to the emergency department with a 3-month history of progressive
fatigue, malaise and anorexia, and 5 weeks of cough with blood-streaked sputum
and progressive peripheral edema. Through the complementary study, a rare
diagnosis of PRS with triple-seropositive for both ANCA (MPO and PR3) and
anti-GBM antibodies was made in a patient with untreated chronic hepatitis B
virus infection. She was treated with glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide, plasma
exchange and entecavir, with pulmonary recovery. Renal function did not improve. 
After 2 years, the patient is still in dialysis, but did not have relapse of
alveolar hemorrhage and ANCA and anti-GBM antibody titers remain negative. The
authors intend to warn to PRS, in particular this rare cause, since delaying
diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity and mortality for patients.
