It is highly important to sensitively measure the abundance of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on various surfaces. Here, we
present a nucleic acid-based detection method consisting of a new sample
preparation protocol that isolates only viruses, not the free RNA fragments
already present on the surfaces of indoor human-inhabited environments, using a
graphene oxide-coated microbead filter. Wet wipes (100 cm2), not cotton swabs,
were used to collect viruses from environmental surfaces with large areas, and
viruses were concentrated and separated with a graphene oxide-coated microbead
filter. Viral RNA from virus was recovered 88.10 ± 8.03% from the surface and
free RNA fragment was removed by 99.75 ± 0.19% from the final eluted solution.
When we tested the developed method under laboratory conditions, a 10-fold higher
viral detection sensitivity (Detection limit: 1 pfu/100 cm2) than the current
commercial protocol was observed. Using our new sample preparation protocol, we
also confirmed that the virus was effectively removed from surfaces after
chemical disinfection; we were unable to measure the disinfection efficiency
using the current commercial protocol because it cannot distinguish between viral
RNA and free RNA fragments. Finally, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2
and bacteria in 12 individual negative pressure wards in which patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection had been hospitalized. Bacteria (based on 16 S DNA) were
found in all samples collected from patient rooms; however, SARS-CoV-2 was mainly
detected in rooms shared by two patients.
