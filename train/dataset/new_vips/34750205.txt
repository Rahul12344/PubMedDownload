Due to limited access to vaccines, many countries have only administered a single
dose of the AZD1222, whereas the dosage intervals have increased ≥4 wk. We sought
to investigate the immunogenicity of a single dose of vaccine at ≥16 wk
postimmunization. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific Abs in
553 individuals and Abs to the receptor-binding domain of the Wuhan virus
(wild-type) and the variants of concern, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor
blocking Abs ex vivo and cultured IFN-γ T cell (Homo sapiens) responses and B
cell (H. sapiens) ELISPOT responses, were investigated in a subcohort. The
seropositivity rates in those >70 y of age (93.7%) was not significantly
different compared with other age groups (97.7-98.2; Pearson χ2 = 7.8; p = 0.05).
The Ab titers (Ab index) significantly declined (p < 0.0001) with increase in
age. A total of 18 of 69 (26.1%) of individuals did not have
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-blocking Abs, whereas responses to the
receptor-binding domain of wild-type (p = 0.03), B.1.1.7 (p = 0.04), and
B.1.617.2 (p = 0.02) were significantly lower in those who were >60 y. Ex vivo
IFN-γ T cell ELISPOT responses were seen in 10 of 66 (15.1%), whereas only a few 
expressed CD107a. However, >85% had a high frequency of cultured IFN-γ T cell
ELISPOT responses and B cell ELISPOTs. Virus-specific Abs were maintained at ≥16 
wk after receiving a single dose of AZD1222, although levels were lower to
variants of concern, especially in older individuals. A single dose induced a
high frequency of memory T and B cell responses.
