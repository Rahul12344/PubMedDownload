According to WHO goals, the elimination of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) by 2030
requires enhancing and simplifying HCV testing. Our aim was to create a model to 
assess and compare different strategies for HCV testing, linkage to care and
treatment among people who access harm reduction centres (HRC) and Addiction
Centres in Catalonia. A decision tree model was designed to evaluate two
strategies: Hepatitis C Point-of-care (POC) "test and treat", at the community
versus standard-of-care (SOC), in which HCV testing was performed at community
and therapy at the hospital. Both strategies were assessed separately in HRCs
(6,878 users) and Addiction Centres (13,778 users). with a time horizon of 18
months. Healthcare outcomes were HCV testing, linkage to care, treatment outcomes
and reinfection rate. HCV testing was performed in 3,178 (46%) of the HRC users. 
Compared with SOC, POC increased access to treatment by 57% (63% vs. 6%). SVR
rates were 64% in POC vs. 23% in SOC. Reinfection rates were 21% with POC
compared to 24% with SOC. With POC, losses to follow-up were reduced by 41%. In
the Addiction Centres, 12,566 users (91%) were screened using the two strategies.
Compared to the SOC, POC increased access to treatment and linkage to care by 19%
along with SVR at the same rate. Reinfection rates decreased by 6%. Thus, the
implementation of a POC "test and treat" strategy at HRCs and Addiction Centres
has shown to be an effective public health strategy to help eliminating HCV in
accordance with WHO goal.
