Objectives: To explore and understand the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of
convalescents, the association between antibody levels and demographic factors,
and the seroepidemiology of convalescents of COVID-19 till March 2021. Methods:
We recruited 517 voluntary COVID-19 convalescents in Sichuan Province and
collected 1,707 serum samples till March 2021. Then we reported the
seroprevalence and analyzed the associated factors. Results: Recent travel
history was associated with IgM levels. Convalescents who had recent travel
history were less likely to be IgM antibody negative [OR = 0.232, 95% CI: (0.128,
0.420)]. Asymptomatic cases had, approximately, twice the odds of being IgM
antibody negative compared with symptomatic cases [OR = 2.583, 95% CI: (1.554,
4.293)]. Participants without symptoms were less likely to be IgG seronegative
than those with symptoms [OR = 0.511, 95% CI: (0.293, 0.891)]. Convalescents aged
40-59 were less likely to be IgG seronegative than those aged below 20 [OR =
0.364, 95% CI: (0.138, 0.959)]. The duration of positive IgM antibodies persisted
365 days while the IgG persisted more than 399 days. Conclusions: Our findings
suggested that recent travel history might be associated with the antibody levels
of IgM, while age could be associated with the antibody levels of IgG. Infection 
type could be associated with both antibody levels of IgM and IgG that declined
quicker in asymptomatic cases.
