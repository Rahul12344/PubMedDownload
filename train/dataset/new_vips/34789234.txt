BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic recession has
increased parental psychosocial stress and mental health challenges. This has
adversely impacted child development and wellbeing, particularly for children
from priority populations (culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and
rural/regional communities) who are at an already increased risk of health
inequality. The increased mental health and psychosocial needs were compounded by
the closure of in-person preventive and health promotion programs resulting in
health organisations embracing technology and online services. Watch Me Grow-
Electronic (WMG-E) - developmental surveillance platform- exemplifies one such
service. WMG-E was developed to monitor child development and guide parents
towards more detailed assessments when risk is identified. This Randomised
Controlled Trial (RCT) aims to expand WMG-E as a digital navigation tool by also 
incorporating parents' mental health and psychosocial needs. Children and
families needing additional assessments and supports will be electronically
directed to relevant resources in the 'care-as-usual' group. In contrast, the
intervention group will receive continuity of care, with additional in-person
assessment and 'warm hand over' by a 'service navigator' to ensure their needs
are met.
METHODS: Using an RCT we will determine: (1) parental engagement with
developmental surveillance; (2) access to services for those with mental health
and social care needs; and (3) uptake of service recommendations. Three hundred
parents/carers of children aged 6 months to 3 years (recruited from a culturally 
diverse, or rural/regional site) will be randomly allocated to the
'care-as-usual' or 'intervention' group. A mixed methods implementation
evaluation will be completed, with semi-structured interviews to ascertain the
acceptability, feasibility and impact of the WMG-E platform and service
navigator.
CONCLUSIONS: Using WMG-E is expected to: normalise and de-stigmatise mental
health and psychosocial screening; increase parental engagement and service use; 
and result in the early identification and management of child developmental
needs, parental mental health, and family psychosocial needs. If effective,
digital solutions such as WMG-E to engage and empower parents alongside a service
navigator for vulnerable families needing additional support, will have
significant practice and policy implications in the pandemic/post pandemic
period.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial (Protocol No. 1.0, Version 3.1) was registered with
ANZCTR (registration number: ACTRN12621000766819 ) on July 21st, 2021 and
reporting of the trial results will be according to recommendations in the
CONSORT Statement.
