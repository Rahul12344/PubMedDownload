Three newly identified equine parvoviruses (equine parvovirus hepatitis (EqPV-H),
equine parvovirus CSF (EqPV-CSF) and equine copivirus (Eqcopivirus)) have
recently been discovered in horses with respiratory signs. However, the clinical 
impact of these three equine parvoviruses has yet to be determined. Nasal fluid
samples and blood from 667 equids with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs
submitted to a diagnostic laboratory were analyzed for the presence of common
equine respiratory pathogens (equine influenza virus, equine herpesvirus-1/-4,
equine rhinitis A and B virus, S. equi subspecies equi) as well as EqPV-H,
EqPV-CSF and Eqcopivirus by qPCR. An additional 87 clinically healthy horses
served as controls. One hundred and seventeen sick horses tested qPCR-positive
for at least one of the three parvoviruses. Co-infections with common respiratory
pathogens and parvoviruses were seen in 39 sick equids. All 87 clinically healthy
horses tested qPCR-negative for all tested common respiratory pathogens and 10
healthy horses tested qPCR-positive for one of the equine parvoviruses. When the 
frequency of detection for EqPV-H, EqPV-CSF and Eqcopivirus of equids with
respiratory signs was compared to that of clinically healthy horses, the
difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05), suggesting that the
three recently identified equine parvoviruses do not contribute to the clinical
picture of equids with respiratory disease.
