Various authors have hypothesized carotid body (CB) involvement in Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19), through direct invasion or indirect effects by systemic 
stimuli ('cytokine storm', angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]1/ACE2 imbalance). 
However, empirical evidence is limited or partial. Here, we present an integrated
histopathological and virological analysis of CBs sampled at autopsy from four
subjects (2 males and 2 females; age: >70 years old) who died of COVID-19.
Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular investigation techniques
were employed to characterize Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV2) viral invasion and inflammatory reaction. SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected 
in the CBs of three cases through Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In these cases, positive immunostaining for Nucleocapsid
and Spike protein were also demonstrated, mainly at the level of large roundish
cells consistent with type I cells, confirming direct CB invasion. In these
cases, T lymphocytes showed focal aggregations in the CBs, suggestive of local
inflammatory reaction. Blood congestion and microthrombosis were also found in
one of the positive cases. Intriguingly, microthrombosis, blood congestion and
microhaemorrages were also bilaterally detected in the CBs of the negative case, 
supporting the possibility of COVID-19 effects on the CB even in the absence of
its direct invasion. SARS-CoV-2 direct invasion of the CB is confirmed through
both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, with likely involvement of different cell
types. We also reported histopathological findings which could be ascribed to
local and/or systemic actions of SARS-CoV-2 and which could potentially affect
chemoreception.
