OBJECTIVES: To study the correlation between the putative cancer stem cell (CSC) 
markers aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44),
sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4) and
human papilloma virus (HPV) infection using p16, the surrogate marker of HPV in
oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and normal mucosa.
METHODS: Five sections each from 40 histopathologically diagnosed cases of
different grades of OED and 10 cases of normal oral mucosa without dysplasia were
immunohistochemically stained with p16, ALDH1, CD44, SOX2, and OCT4,
respectively.
RESULTS: Expression of ALDH1 and SOX2 was significantly increased in OED cases,
whereas CD44 and OCT4 expression was increased in normal mucosa. P16-positive OED
cases showed upregulation of ALDH1 and OCT4 expression as compared to
p16-negative cases, while CD44 and SOX2 expression was downregulated in
p16-positive OED cases; however, the results were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The present study indicated a suggestive link between p16 and cancer 
stem cell marker expression in HPV-associated OED, and that p16 has a significant
role in CSC progression in OED. This is the first study to evaluate the
expression of putative CSC markers in HPV-associated OED. However, low study
numbers are a potential limiting factor in this study.
