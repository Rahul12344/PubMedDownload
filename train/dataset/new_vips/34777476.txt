Background: Approximately 50% of thymoma patients also show myasthenia gravis
(MG), which is an autoimmune disease; however, the pathogenesis of MG-associated 
thymoma remains elusive. Our aim was to investigate immune-related lncRNA
profiles of a set of candidate genes for better understanding of the molecular
mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of thymoma with or without MG. Methods:
Molecular profiles of thymoma with or without MG were downloaded from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas, and Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to identify
immune-related lncRNAs. T test was used to examine the differential expression
and differential methylation between thymoma patients with or without MG. Gene
Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were performed to
predict the function of target genes of immune-related lncRNAs. Results: Analyses
of the 87 thymoma samples with complete MG information revealed that 205 mRNAs
and 56 lncRNAs showed up-regulated expression in thymoma with MG patients, while 
458 mRNAs and 84 lncRNAs showed down-regulated expression. The methylation level 
of three immune-related lncRNAs (AP000787.1, AC004943.1, WT1-AS, FOXG1-AS1) was
significantly decreased in thymoma tissues, and the methylation level of these
immune-related lncRNAs (WT1-AS: Cor = 0.368, p < 0.001; FOXG1-AS1: Cor = 0.288, p
< 0.01; AC004943.1: Cor = -0.236, p < 0.05) correlated with their expression. GO 
and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that targets of the immune-related lncRNA
FOXG1-AS1 were enriched in small GTPase binding and herpes simplex virus 1
infection. Transcription coregulator activity and cell cycle were the most
enriched pathways for targets of lncRNA AC004943.1. LncRNA WT1-AS targets were
most enriched in actin binding and axon guidance. Conclusion: Our results
revealed the immune-related molecular profiling of thymoma with MG and without MG
and identified key pathways involved in the underlying molecular mechanism of
thymoma-related MG. These findings provide insights for further research of
potential markers for thymoma-related MG.
