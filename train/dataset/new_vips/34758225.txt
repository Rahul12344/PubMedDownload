BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 has seriously
threatened people. In this study, we detected the expression of anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgG/IgM and respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with COVID-19 and
explored the correlation and clinical significance between SARS-CoV-2 antibody
and respiratory SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
METHODS: From March 5, 2020 to April 28, 2020, 48 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed
in Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by 
real-time fluorescence RT-PCR method. Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies were
determined by colloidal gold immunochromatography. The statistical analysis was
performed using chi-squared test.
RESULTS: In all the patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA among 270 upper respiratory tract
(nasal or throat swabs) samples, 71 lower respiratory tract (sputum) samples, and
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies in 123 serum samples were detected during the 
hospitalization period. The positive rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was
significantly higher than that of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM within the first week after
symptom onset (p < 0.05). The positive rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was also
significantly higher than that of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM during day 8 - 30 after
symptom onset (p < 0.01). The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lower
respiratory tract specimens (64.8%, 46/71) was significantly higher than that in 
the upper respiratory tract (46.7%, 126/270) (p < 0.05). The positive rate (100%,
4/4) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the lower respiratory tract specimens before 
IgG seroconversion was significantly higher than that of the positive rate
(59.3%, 32/54) after IgG seroconversion (p < 0.01). The positive rate (72.2%,
57/79) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract specimens
before IgG seroconversion was significantly higher than that of the positive rate
(30.7%, 39/127) after IgG seroconversion (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG might be detected within the first week after
symptom onset. The application of SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG/IgM) detection is
important for the suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with negative
SARS-CoV-2 RNA results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the
lower respiratory tract specimens was significantly higher than that in the upper
respiratory tract. Sputum detection is recommended for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Using lower respiratory tract specimens may reduce the false
negative PCR tests. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be improved by
investigating follow-up specimens over time.
