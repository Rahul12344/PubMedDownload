BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion centres should understand the epidemiology of
emerging diseases that are transmissible through the transfusion of blood
components. The risk of transmission of arboviruses through this route has become
apparent in recent years. The aim of our study is to summarise the reported
prevalence (viraemic rate, seroprevalence and/or antigen detection) of
Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses in blood donors
according to screening test used and world region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and
meta-analysis having searched for information in the main bibliographic databases
(MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus). The prevalence for each of the viruses was
calculated according to the screening test used and geographic location.
RESULTS: We included 18 records on CHIKV, 71 on DENV, and 27 on ZIKV. The highest
prevalences of RNA for CHIKV were 1.9% in Puerto Rico (2014), 1.0% in Thailand
(2009), and 1.0% in French Polynesia (2014-15). The highest prevalences of RNA
for DENV were 5.5% in Saudi Arabia (2015-16), 2.3% in Madeira, Portugal
(2012-13), and 0.6% in Brazil (2012). The highest prevalences of RNA for ZIKV
were 2.8% in French Polynesia (2013-14), 2.7% in Brazil (2015-16), and 1.8% in
Martinique (2016). Overall seroprevalence, as assessed by IgG antibodies, was
21.6% for CHIKV, 24.0% for DENV, and 5.1% for ZIKV.
DISCUSSION: Our study shows a high proportion of donors who are viraemic and
asymptomatic, especially during outbreaks, with prevalences surpassing 5% for
DENV, 1% for CHIKV, and 2% for ZIKV. These data confirm a clear threat to blood
transfusion safety. The elevated seroprevalence for these three arboviruses is
also indicative of their wide circulation in populations, correlating with an
increased risk of infected but asymptomatic donors. Health centres and
institutions must address this threat, especially in tropical regions where the
biggest outbreaks occur.
