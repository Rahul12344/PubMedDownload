A 76-year-old female received a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac, Sinovac®, Beijing, China) and subsequently
experienced chest discomfort. A computed tomography performed 1 day after
vaccination showed multiple infiltrations in both lungs and ground-glass shadows 
in both lung fields. Her fingertip oxygen saturation was 81% and there was
widespread wheezing on physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient
was hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonitis and
acute asthma exacerbation due to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. During her
hospitalization, 40 mg/d systemic steroid, 4 times a day salbutamol nebulized, 2 
L/min inhaled oxygen therapy and 400 mg/d moxifloxacin intravenous were
administered for 5 days. One month later, the thorax computed tomography scan
revealed that the previous findings were almost completely regressed.
