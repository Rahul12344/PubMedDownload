Project Vigilancia de Embarazadas con Zika (VEZ), an intensified surveillance of 
pregnant women with symptoms of the Zika virus disease (ZVD) in Colombia, aimed
to evaluate the relationship between symptoms of ZVD during pregnancy and adverse
pregnancy, birth, and infant outcomes and early childhood neurodevelopmental
outcomes. During May-November 2016, pregnant women in three Colombian cities who 
were reported with symptoms of ZVD to the national surveillance system, or with
symptoms of ZVD visiting participating clinics, were enrolled in Project VEZ.
Data from maternal and pediatric (up to two years of age) medical records were
abstracted. Available maternal specimens were tested for the presence of the Zika
virus ribonucleic acid and/or anti-Zika virus immunoglobulin antibodies. Of 1213 
enrolled pregnant women with symptoms of ZVD, 1180 had a known pregnancy outcome.
Results of the Zika virus laboratory testing were available for 569 (48.2%)
pregnancies with a known pregnancy outcome though testing timing varied and was
often distal to the timing of symptoms; 254 (21.5% of the whole cohort; 44.6% of 
those with testing results) were confirmed or presumptive positive for the Zika
virus infection. Of pregnancies with a known outcome, 50 (4.2%) fetuses/infants
had Zika-associated brain or eye defects, which included microcephaly at birth.
Early childhood adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were more common among those 
with Zika-associated birth defects than among those without and more common among
those with laboratory evidence of a Zika virus infection compared with the full
cohort. The proportion of fetuses/infants with any Zika-associated brain or eye
defect was consistent with the proportion seen in other studies. Enhancements to 
Colombia's existing national surveillance enabled the assessment of adverse
outcomes associated with ZVD in pregnancy.
