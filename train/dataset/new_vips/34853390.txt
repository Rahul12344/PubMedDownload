Human astrovirus (HAstV) is one of the common causes of acute gastroenteritis in 
children. The investigation of molecular epidemiology of HAstV is essential for
monitoring the emergence and/or re-emergence of new HAstV genotypes, as well as
understanding the evolution of HAstV circulating in children suffering from acute
gastroenteritis. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and
distribution of HAstVs strains circulating in children hospitalized with acute
gastroenteritis in Chiang Mai, Thailand during 2017-2020. A total of 1500 fecal
specimens collected from children with acute gastroenteritis were screened for
HAstV by RT-PCR that targeted the partial RdRp in ORF1b and strains
were characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Of the 1500 fecal
samples, 39 (2.6%) were positive for HAstV. Of these, both classic and novel
HAstV genotypes, including classic HAstV1-HAstV5, novel HAstV-MLB1, MLB2, and
HAstV-VA2, were detected. The data in this study revealed a high divergence of
HAstV genotypes circulating in pediatric patients admitted to the hospitals with 
acute gastroenteritis in Chiang Mai, Thailand during 2017-2020.
