L-sulforaphane (LSF) is an isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables
that has long been known for its anticarcinogenic, antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory effects. LSF also possesses antimicrobial properties, although 
the evidence for this is limited. Respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), are leading global causes of illness and death among
children aged under five years, particularly in resource-poor countries where
access to vaccines are limited or, in the case of S. pyogenes and RSV, vaccines
have not been licensed for use in humans. Therefore, alternative strategies to
prevent and/or treat these common infectious diseases are urgently needed. This
study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial effects of LSF against
common respiratory pathogens, S. pneumoniae (serotypes 1 and 6B), H. influenzae
type B (HiB), non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi), S. pyogenes and RSV in relevant 
human cell-based models. LSF significantly inhibited the growth of H. influenzae,
but not S. pneumoniae or S. pyogenes. LSF did not improve opsonophagocytic
capacity or killing by human phagocytic cell lines (HL-60s and THP-1 macrophages)
for S. pneumoniae yet showed some improved killing for H. influenzae species in
THP-1 macrophages. However, LSF significantly reduced RSV infection in human lung
epithelial cells, associated with increased expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene 
as well as the antioxidant genes, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
(Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1). Overall, LSF represents an exciting avenue 
for further antimicrobial research, particularly as a novel therapy against H.
influenzae species and RSV.
