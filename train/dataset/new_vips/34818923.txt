Oral booster-single strain probiotic bifidobacteria could be a potential strategy
for SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to evaluate the role of oral probiotic
Bifidobacterium on moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients. In this single-center
study, we analyzed data of 44 moderate/severe inpatients with diagnosed COVID-19 
in Istanbul Maltepe University Medical Faculty Hospital, 2020 from 1 November
2020 to 15 December 2020. Clinical and medication features were compared and
analyzed between patients with or without probiotic. In result, 19 of the 44
patients (43.18%) who were administrated with oral booster-single strain
probiotic were discharged with the median inpatient day of 7.6 days which were
significantly shorter than those of patients without probiotic. There were
significant differences in inpatient days, radiological improvement at day 6 and 
week 3, and reduction in interleukin-6 levels in those receiving oral probiotic
therapy. Although the mortality rate was 5% in the probiotic group, it was 25% in
the non-probiotic group. Booster-single strain probiotic bifidobacteria could be 
an effective treatment strategy for moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients to
reduce the mortality and length of stay in hospital.
