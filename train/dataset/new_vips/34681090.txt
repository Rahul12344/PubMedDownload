In this paper, we propose a multi-group SIR to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in
an island context. The multi-group aspect enables us to modelize transmissions of
the virus between non-vaccinated individuals within an age group as well as
between different age groups. In addition, fuzzy subsets and aggregation
operators are used to account for the increased risks associated with age and
obesity within these different groups. From a conceptual point of view, the model
emphasizes the notion of Hospitalization which is the major stake of this
pandemic by replacing the compartment R (Removed) by compartment H
(Hospitalization). The experimental results were carried out using medical and
demographic data from the archipelago, Guadeloupe (French West Indies) in the
Caribbean. These results show that without the respect of barrier gestures, a
first wave would concern the elderly then a second the adults and the young
people, which conforms to the real data.
