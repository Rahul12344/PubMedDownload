BACKGROUND: Older age and comorbidities are the main risk factors for adverse
COVID-19 outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The impact
of IBD medications is still under investigation.
AIMS: To assess risk factors for adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in IBD patients and
use the identified risk factors to build risk indices.
METHODS: Observational cohort study. Univariable and multivariable logistic
regression was used to identify risk factors associated with pneumonia,
hospitalisation, need for ventilatory support, and death.
RESULTS: Of the 937 patients (446 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) evaluated, 128
(13.7%) had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 664 (70.8%) had a favourable
course, and 135 (15.5%) had moderate or severe COVID-19. In UC patients, obesity,
active disease and comorbidities were significantly associated with adverse
outcomes. In patients with Crohn's disease (CD), age, obesity, comorbidities and 
an additional immune-mediated inflammatory disease were identified as risk
factors. These risk factors were incorporated into two indices to identify
patients with UC or CD with a higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. In
multivariable analyses, no single IBD medication was associated with poor
COVID-19 outcomes, but anti-TNF agents were associated with a lower risk of
pneumonia in UC, and lower risks of hospitalisation and severe COVID-19 in CD.
CONCLUSION: The course of COVID-19 in patients with IBD is similar to that in the
general population. IBD patients with active disease and comorbidities are at
greater risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. IBD medications do not pose additional
risks. The risk indices may help to identify patients who should be prioritised
for COVID-19 re-vaccination or for therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
