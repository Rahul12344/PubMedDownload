BACKGROUND: Acute gastroenteritis is the most common cause of illness and death
in infants and young children worldwide. Rotaviruses (RVs) are the major viruses 
that cause acute gastroenteritis in young children, especially in developing
countries in Asia and Africa.
METHODS: The presence of rotavirus antigens in sera of four unvaccinated
pediatric patients, aged between 4 and 6 years with severe diarrhea and
dehydration, were detected by using three immunochromatographic (IC) kits. In
addition, the presence of anti-rotavirus IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies and their
concentrations in patient sera were also determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).
RESULTS: All three kits could detect rotavirus antigen in patient sera with
different intensity of the test lines. When patient sera were pretreated with
anti-VP6 rotavirus mouse monoclonal antibody prior to testing, the rotavirus
positive test lines disappeared, suggesting that all patient sera contained VP6
protein antigen of rotavirus. Assessment of antibody concentration in these
patient sera revealed that all patient sera contained IgG, IgA, and IgM
antibodies against rotavirus antigen at different concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of rotavirus protein detection in the patient sera
of one IC kit brand was comparable to those of the EIA, suggesting this IC kit
could be an alternative screening method for rapid diagnosis of rotavirus
infection.
