BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic called for a new ethical climate in the
designated hospitals and imposed challenges on care quality for anti-pandemic
nurses. Less was known about whether hospital ethical climate and nurses' ethical
sensitivity were associated with care quality. This study examined the
association between the perceived hospital ethical climate and self-evaluated
quality of care for COVID-19 patients among anti-pandemic nurses, and explored
the mediating role of ethical sensitivity in this relationship.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey. A total 
of 399 anti-pandemic nurses from ten designated hospitals in three provinces of
China were recruited to fill out an online survey. Multiple linear regression
analysis and a bootstrap test were used to examine the relationships between
ethical climate, ethical sensitivity and care quality.
RESULTS: Nurses reported mean scores of 4.43 ± 0.577 (out of 5) for hospital
ethical climate, 45.00 ± 7.085 (out of 54) for ethical sensitivity, and
5.35 ± 0.661 (out of 6) for self-evaluated care quality. After controlling for
covariates, perceived hospital ethical climate was positively associated with
self-evaluated care quality (direct effect = 0.710, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.628, 0.792), and was partly mediated by ethical sensitivity (indirect
effect = 0.078, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.002, 0.145).
CONCLUSIONS: Chinese nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients perceived high levels
of hospital ethical climate, ethical sensitivity, and self-evaluated care
quality. Positive perceptions of hospital ethical climate were both directly
associated with a higher level of self-evaluated care quality and indirectly
associated, through the mediation effect of ethical sensitivity among
anti-pandemic nurses.
