Tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) are highly proliferative
neoplasms that generally respond well to platinum/taxane chemotherapy. We
recently identified minichromosome maintenance complex component 3 (MCM3), which 
is involved in the initiation of DNA replication and proliferation, as a
favorable prognostic marker in HGSC. Our objective was to further validate
whether MCM3 mRNA expression and possibly MCM3 protein levels are associated with
survival in patients with HGSC. MCM3 mRNA expression was measured using
NanoString expression profiling on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue
(N = 2355 HGSC) and MCM3 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry 
(N = 522 HGSC) and compared with Ki-67. Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox
proportional hazards model were used to estimate associations with survival.
Among chemotherapy-naïve HGSC, higher MCM3 mRNA expression (one standard
deviation increase in the score) was associated with longer overall survival
(HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.92, p < 0.0001, N = 1840) in multivariable analysis.
MCM3 mRNA expression was highest in the HGSC C5.PRO molecular subtype, although
no interaction was observed between MCM3, survival and molecular subtypes. MCM3
and Ki-67 protein levels were significantly lower after exposure to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy-naïve tumors: 37.0% versus 46.4% and 22.9% 
versus 34.2%, respectively. Among chemotherapy-naïve HGSC, high MCM3 protein
levels were also associated with significantly longer disease-specific survival
(HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.74, p = 0.0003, N = 392) compared to cases with low
MCM3 protein levels in multivariable analysis. MCM3 immunohistochemistry is a
promising surrogate marker of proliferation in HGSC.
