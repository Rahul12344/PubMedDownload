BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2, has a broad clinical spectrum, from asymptomatic to
multi-organ dysfunction. Acute cerebrovascular events associated with coronavirus
disease 2019 are mainly due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2-induced prothrombotic state. Bilateral basal ganglia ischemia is rarely
reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 64-year-old Asian (Pakistani)
gentleman who presented initially with fever, cough, and shortness of breath,
likely due to respiratory involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2. Later, he developed bilateral lower limb pain, followed by
confusion and decreased level of consciousness. Accentuated large hypodense
opacities were seen in the left and right basal ganglia, with mass effects on the
left frontal horn.
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the importance of neuroimaging in the
effective management of patients with neurological signs associated with
coronavirus disease 2019.
