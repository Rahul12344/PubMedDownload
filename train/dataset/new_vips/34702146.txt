Stigma remains an important barrier to seeking and staying in care among
individuals infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Despite continued
widespread information, education and communication campaigns to raise awareness 
about the infection. The aim of the study was to identify factors related to HIV 
stigma among a commuter population in the inner-city Johannesburg. A
self-administered closed-ended questionnaire was loaded onto personal tablet
computers during a community outreach campaign. The outcome was measured by
asking the respondents to rate their perceptions of stigma as 'high or low'.
About 1146 participants were enrolled in the study of which 585 (51.0%) reported 
high stigma levels. Overall, being married/cohabiting (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio 
(APR): 1.14 95%CI: 1.02-1.28), divorced (APR: 1.38 95%CI: 1.07-1.78), were
associated with high levels of stigma; while being aware of HCT services (APR:
0.85 95%CI: 0.75-0.97) and employment status (APR: 0.78 95%CI: 0.71-0.87) were
less likely associated with a high level of stigma. High HIV stigma still exists 
among those affected in our communities. Enhancement of health promotion
intervention and reinforcing the benefits of knowing HIV status is essential to
mitigate factors shown to influence stigma in the commuter population. Such an
approach would help overcome stigma, an obstacle for expanding access to HIV
testing and counselling.
