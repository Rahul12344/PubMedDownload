The purpose of this study is to develop a smartphone-based self-care program (Hep
B Care速) for patients with the chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). To pilot test the
feasibility of Hep B Care速, 63 participants with chronic HBV were recruited from 
an outpatient clinic at S hospital, Seoul, South Korea (experimental group [EG]: 
n = 30, control group [CG]: n = 33) between February and July 2016. Hep B Care速
was developed based on the theory of self-care whilst having a chronic illness.
During the 12-week intervention period, the application: (1) provided information
about the disease, medication, nutrition, and exercise; (2) encouraged taking
medication and exercise using alarms; and (3) enabled the exchange of messages
between healthcare providers and patients. Salivary cortisol, fatigue,
depression, anxiety, knowledge of the HBV, quality of life, and medication
adherence were all measured as outcomes. Cortisol levels were significantly
increased, knowledge of the HBV was improved, and the mean anxiety score was
significantly decreased in the EG. Thus, Hep B Care 速 partially improved health
outcomes in the EG. We recommend that large trials be conducted among patients
with the HBV. The smartphone-based self-care program for providing education and 
coaching is effective for improving knowledge and reducing anxiety among patients
with the HBV.
