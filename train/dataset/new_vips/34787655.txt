Importance: There is a need for studies to evaluate the risk factors for COVID-19
and mortality among the entire Medicare long-term dialysis population using
Medicare claims data.
Objective: To identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 and mortality in
Medicare patients undergoing long-term dialysis.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, claims-based cohort study 
compared mortality trends of patients receiving long-term dialysis in 2020 with
previous years (2013-2019) and fit Cox regression models to identify risk factors
for contracting COVID-19 and postdiagnosis mortality. The cohort included the
national population of Medicare patients receiving long-term dialysis in 2020,
derived from clinical and administrative databases. COVID-19 was identified
through Medicare claims sources. Data were analyzed on May 17, 2021.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The 2 main outcomes were COVID-19 and all-cause
mortality. Associations of claims-based risk factors with COVID-19 and mortality 
were investigated prediagnosis and postdiagnosis.
Results: Among a total of 498 169 Medicare patients undergoing dialysis (median
[IQR] age, 66 [56-74] years; 215 935 [43.1%] women and 283 227 [56.9%] men),
60 090 (12.1%) had COVID-19, among whom 15 612 patients (26.0%) died. COVID-19
rates were significantly higher among Black (21 787 of 165 830 patients [13.1%]) 
and Hispanic (13 530 of 86 871 patients [15.6%]) patients compared with non-Black
patients (38 303 of 332 339 [11.5%]), as well as patients with short (ie, 1-89
days; 7738 of 55 184 patients [14.0%]) and extended (ie, ≥90 days; 10 737 of
30 196 patients [35.6%]) nursing home stays in the prior year. Adjusting for all 
other risk factors, residing in a nursing home 1 to 89 days in the prior year was
associated with a higher hazard for COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR] vs 0 days, 1.60; 
95% CI 1.56-1.65) and for postdiagnosis mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.25-1.37), 
as was residing in a nursing home for an extended stay (COVID-19: HR, 4.48; 95%
CI, 4.37-4.59; mortality: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16). Black race (HR vs
non-Black: HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and Hispanic ethnicity (HR vs
non-Hispanic: HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.64-1.72) were associated with significantly
higher hazards of COVID-19. Although home dialysis was associated with lower
COVID-19 rates (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.80), it was associated with higher
mortality (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25).
Conclusions and Relevance: These results shed light on COVID-19 risk factors and 
outcomes among Medicare patients receiving long-term chronic dialysis and could
inform policy decisions to mitigate the significant extra burden of COVID-19 and 
death in this population.
