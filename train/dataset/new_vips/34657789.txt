Giant viruses have extravagantly large double-stranded (ds)DNA genomes that are
packaged into exceedingly complex virions. In two recent papers, Liu et al. and
Valencia-Sánchez, Abini-Agbomson et al. show that some giant viruses encode
unique histone doublets, which form nucleosomes remarkably similar to those found
across the eukaryotic domain of life.
