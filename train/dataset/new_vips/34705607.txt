PURPOSE: Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) is a serious constraint in
the mungbean which is a potential source of easily digestible high-quality
proteins, fibers, minerals, and vitamins in Asian countries. Developing resistant
cultivars is the most cost-effective, eco-friendly, and sustainable approach to
protect mungbean from MYMIV damage. Mutation breeding provides a quick and
cost-effective way of developing resistance as lack of genetic variability is the
biggest bottleneck for other traditional breeding tools.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outstanding but MYMIV-sensitive varieties of mungbean,
viz., MH 2-15 and MH 318 were mutagenized through various individual and combined
doses of gamma-rays and Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and evaluated in M2 and M3
generations for the appearance of resistance reactions. This was subsequently
validated through marker-assisted genotyping using previously reported Yellow
Mosaic Disease (YMD) linked markers.
RESULTS: The phenotyping in M3 generation yielded 64 MYMIV resistant mutants
whereas, marker-assisted genotyping identified the 22 mutants with true
resistance. Markers YR4, CYR1, and CEDG180 were found associated with MYMIV
resistance whereas, DMB-SSR158 did not show any amplification. Among identified
resistant mutants, ten lines exhibited at par and two revealed a little higher
seed yield over controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The mutagenesis created significant variability in MYMIV resistance 
as well as seed yield per plant. YR4, CYR1, and CEDG180 are found to be linked
with the MYMIV loci in the mungbean and could be utilized for MYMIV resistance
breeding. Mutant M-37 from MH 2-15 and M-104 from MH 318 exhibited more seed
yield along with MYMIV resistance which upon further validation can be released
as a variety. The induced mutagenesis integrated with powerful emerging molecular
and next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools would be highly helpful in breeding
mungbean for durable resistance against threatening MYMIV.
