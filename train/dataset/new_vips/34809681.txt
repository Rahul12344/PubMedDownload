OBJECTIVE: To promote public health and resume university activities, COVID-19
vaccination has been mandated from an increasing number of universities
worldwide. The objective of the study is to understand the factors that impact
preference and willingness to take the vaccine among university students in Hong 
Kong universities utilizing an online questionnaire. The findings will be
imperative for health education and the success of the vaccination program.
RESULTS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment survey among university
students in Hong Kong and applied conditional logit regression to estimate their 
vaccine preference and the weight of each attribute. Regression results showed
adverse reactions, efficacy, origin of the vaccine, required number of doses and 
out-of-pocket price are significant determinants for the choice of vaccine,
ranked from the most to least important. Similar preference weighting results
were observed after adjusting age, sex, monthly household income, studying
medical-related subjects and recent influenza vaccination. Safety, efficacy and
origin of the vaccine are key drivers for vaccination decisions among young
adults in Hong Kong. Health education and communication focused on these factors 
are urgently needed to overcome vaccine hesitancy and improve the vaccine uptake.
