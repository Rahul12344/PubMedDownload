Coronavirus is a high-risk pathogen for kidney transplant recipients receiving
immunosuppressive therapy; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection
causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV2), and progressive withdrawal
of immunosuppressive drugs has been suggested in transplanted patients. At IRCCS 
San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, Northern Italy, during the pandemic we performed a 
screening and all transplanted patients were evaluated for IgG anti SARS-CoV-2;
12 of 201 kidney transplant recipients (6%) screened for IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 (s) 
developed kidney transplant rejection; 10 (83%) were negative and 2 (17%)
resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while among 189 patients without rejection,
162 (86%) resulted negative and 27 (14%) positive (P=0.69). COVID 19 course may
be more severe in kidney transplant recipients but it does not significantly
increase risk of kidney rejection.
