BACKGROUND: Treatment of mycoses is often ineffective, usually prolonged, and has
some side effects. These facts highlight the importance of discovering new
molecules to treat fungal infections.
OBJECTIVES: To search the Medicines for Malaria Venture COVID Box for drugs with 
antifungal activity.
METHODS: Fourteen human pathogenic fungi were tested against the 160 drugs of
this collection at 1.0 µM concentration. We evaluated the ability of the drugs to
impair fungal growth, their fungicidal nature, and morphological changes caused
to cells.
FINDINGS: Thirty-four molecules (21.25%) presented antifungal activity. Seven are
antifungal drugs and one is the agricultural fungicide cycloheximide. The other
drugs with antifungal activity included antibiotics (n = 3), antimalarials (n =
4), antivirals (n = 2), antiparasitcs (n = 3), antitumor agents (n = 5), nervous 
system agents (n = 3), immunosuppressants (n = 3), antivomiting (n = 1),
antiasthmatic (n = 1), and a genetic disorder agent (n = 1). Several of these
drugs inhibited Histoplasma capsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis growth
(15 and 20, respectively), while Fusarium solani was not affected by the drugs
tested. Most drugs were fungistatic, but niclosamide presented fungicidal
activity against the three dimorphic fungi tested. Cyclosporine affected
morphology of Cryptococcus neoformans.
MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These drugs represent new alternatives to the development of
more accessible and effective therapies to treat human fungal infections.
