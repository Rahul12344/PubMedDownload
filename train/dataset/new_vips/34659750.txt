Introduction: the COVID-19 pandemic still accounts for thousands of cases every
day. It's neurological involvement has been well documented most likely due to
auto-immune mechanisms than the virus itself.
Case report: we report the case of a 38 years old women who developed an Acute
Disseminated Encephalomyelitis following a COVID-19 infection, with a favorable
outcome after immunosuppressive therapy.
Discussion: In this chapter, we discuss ADEM's pathogenesis as well as its
clinical and radiological features before detailing its relationship with
infectious and vaccination episodes. We also discuss how our patient disease
evolved.
Conclusion: Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis is an immune-mediated disorder
in which the widespread inflammation of the brain and spinal cord is responsible 
for a variety of symptoms. The novel COVID-19 virus and its vaccine are both a
newly incriminated etiologies of this demyelinating disorder.
