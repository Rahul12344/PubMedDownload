Beginning in the summer of 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the
COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the United Kingdom. This B.1.1.7 variant, also
known as Alpha, increased rapidly in prevalence, attributed to an increase in
infection and/or transmission efficiency1. The Alpha variant has 19 nonsynonymous
mutations across its viral genome, including 8 substitutions or deletions in the 
spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and
tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8
individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness
gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary
human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype
of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 Alpha spike mutations,
suggesting it is a major determinant of increased transmission of this variant.
Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike 
protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in
Brazil, South Africa, and elsewhere2,3, our results indicate that N501Y
substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.
