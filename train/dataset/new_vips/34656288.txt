Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections trigger
viral RNA sensors such as TLR7 and RIG-I, thereby leading to production of type I
interferon (IFN) and other inflammatory mediators. Expression of viral proteins
in the context of this inflammation leads to stereotypical antigen-specific
antibody and T cell responses that clear the virus. Immunity is then maintained
through long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells and by memory B and T cells
that can initiate anamnestic responses. Each of these steps is consistent with
prior knowledge of acute RNA virus infections. Yet there are certain concepts,
while not entirely new, that have been resurrected by the biology of severe
SARS-CoV-2 infections and deserve further attention. These include production of 
anti-IFN autoantibodies, early inflammatory processes that slow adaptive humoral 
immunity, immunodominance of antibody responses, and original antigenic sin.
Moreover, multiple different vaccine platforms allow for comparisons of pathways 
that promote robust and durable adaptive immunity.
