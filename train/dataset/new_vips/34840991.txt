Dengue fever is an infection by the dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by vector
mosquitoes. It causes many infections in tropical and subtropical countries every
year, thus posing a severe disease threat. Cytokine storms, one condition where
many proinflammatory cytokines are mass-produced, might lead to cellular
dysfunction in tissue/organ failures and often facilitate severe dengue disease
in patients. Interleukin- (IL-) 18, similar to IL-1β, is a proinflammatory
cytokine produced during inflammation following inflammasome activation.
Inflammatory stimuli, including microbial infections, damage signals, and
cytokines, all induce the production of IL-18. High serum IL-18 is remarkably
correlated with severely ill dengue patients; however, its possible roles have
been less explored. Based on the clinical and basic findings, this review
discusses the potential immunopathogenic role of IL-18 when it participates in
DENV infection and dengue disease progression based on existing findings and
related past studies.
