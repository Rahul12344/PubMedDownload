Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are bi-segmented dsRNA viruses that have been detected in
various animal species including vertebrates and invertebrates. In this study, 17
complete or incomplete PBV segment-2 and one unsegmented PBV-like virus sequence 
were identified in fecal samples from different bird species using viral
metagenomic approach. The bird PBV and PBV-like virus retained the conservative
motifs that are conserved in dsRNA2 of common PBVs. The RdRp of these 17 PBVs
shared the highest Amino acid (aa) identity of 45.90%∼94.19% with previous animal
and human PBVs, while the RdRp of the unsegment PBV-like virus shared the highest
aa sequence identity of 31.93% with one chicken PBV (GenBank No. MW837829). The
unsegmented PBV-like virus unexpectedly used the yeast mitochondrial genetic code
(transl_table=3) for all ORFs translation. In addition, the prokaryotic RBS
sequence was not only detected upstream to ORF2 at position 360AGGAGG365 of this 
unsegmented PBV-like virus, but also found upstream to ORF of bird PBV dsRNA2.
The presence of the prokaryotic ribosomal binding site in the bird PBV genomes,
and the finding of one novel unsegmented PBV-like virus using the yeast
mitochondrial genetic code for translation supported recent speculations that
PBVs may actually infect prokaryotic or fungal host cells. This study enhanced
our understanding of PBVs and provided data support for exploring the real host
of PBVs.
