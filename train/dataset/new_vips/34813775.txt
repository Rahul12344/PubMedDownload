People living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk for developing skin and
mucosal malignancies despite systemic reconstitution of CD4+ T cells upon
antiretroviral therapy (ART). The underlying mechanism of chronic tissue-related 
immunodeficiency in HIV is unclear. We found that skin CD4+ tissue-resident
memory T (Trm) cells were depleted after HIV infection and replenished only upon 
early ART initiation. TCR clonal analysis following early ART suggested a
systemic origin for reconstituting CD4+ Trm cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing in 
PLWH that received late ART treatment revealed a loss of CXCR3+ Trm cells and a
tolerogenic skin immune environment. Human papilloma virus-induced precancerous
lesion biopsies showed reduced CXCR3+ Trm cell frequencies in the mucosa in PLWH 
versus HIV- individuals. These results reveal an irreversible loss of CXCR3+ Trm 
cells confined to skin and mucosa in PLWH who received late ART treatment, which 
may be a precipitating factor in the development of HPV-related cancer.
