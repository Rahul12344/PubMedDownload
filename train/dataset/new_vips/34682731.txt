Lactoferrin (Lf), a multifunctional cationic glycoprotein synthesized by exocrine
glands and neutrophils, possesses an in vitro antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we conducted an in vivo preliminary study to investigate the
antiviral effect of oral and intranasal liposomal bovine Lf (bLf) in asymptomatic
and mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. From April 2020 to June 2020, a total of 
92 mild-to-moderate (67/92) and asymptomatic (25/92) COVID-19 patients were
recruited and divided into three groups. Thirty-two patients (14 hospitalized and
18 in home-based isolation) received only oral and intranasal liposomal bLf; 32
hospitalized patients were treated only with standard of care (SOC) treatment;
and 28, in home-based isolation, did not take any medication. Furthermore, 32
COVID-19 negative, untreated, healthy subjects were added for ancillary analysis.
Liposomal bLf-treated COVID-19 patients obtained an earlier and significant (p < 
0.0001) SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative conversion compared to the SOC-treated and
untreated COVID-19 patients (14.25 vs. 27.13 vs. 32.61 days, respectively).
Liposomal bLf-treated COVID-19 patients showed fast clinical symptoms recovery
compared to the SOC-treated COVID-19 patients. In bLf-treated patients, a
significant decrease in serum ferritin, IL-6, and D-dimers levels was observed.
No adverse events were reported. These observations led us to speculate a
potential role of bLf in the management of mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic
COVID-19 patients.
