RATIONALE: Presence of synchronous double hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) and
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (sdpHCC-ICC) located separately within a
single liver is extremely rare. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
clinical, imaging, pathological characteristics, and prognosis of patients with
sdpHCC-ICC, in order to enhance our understanding of the disease and improve
diagnostic and therapeutic effect.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old, female with the diagnosis of hepatitis B virus
with obvious liver cirrhosis, was admitted to our hospital. On admission, the
levels of α-fetoprotein and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were found to be elevated. 
Abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography revealed 2 solid
masses located in segments (S) 4 and 6 of the liver, with malignant behaviors.
DIAGNOSES: In the light of above investigations, preoperative diagnosis of
multiple primary hepatocellular carcinomas was made.
INTERVENTION: Hepatic resection of both segments was done. The resected specimens
revealed the presence of well-defined tumors in segments 4 and 6 measuring 5.0 cm
and 2.5 cm respectively.
OUTCOMES: Histopathological examination confirmed the tumor of the 4th segment to
be moderately and poorly differentiated ICC, and the tumor of the 6th segment to 
be poorly differentiated HCC. Immunohistochemically, the ICC in S4 was positive
for CK19 and negative for Heppar-1, whereas the HCC in S6 was positive for
Heppar-1 and negative for CK19. Unfortunately, metastasis to multiple organs and 
lymph nodes were observed 3 months later. The patient died of liver failure
16 months after surgery.
LESSONS: The clinical characteristics of sdpHCC-ICC are usually atypical and
nonspecific making its preoperative diagnosis quite difficult. Hepatitis B virus 
and hepatitis C virus infection were both the independent risk factor for the
development of sdpHCC-ICC. In patients with chronic liver disease, careful
observation with imaging is of utmost necessity. Tumor markers may also play a
valuable role in the diagnosis. The definite diagnosis depends on pathological
examination. Hepatic resection is considered the most effective mode of
treatment. The prognosis of synchronous occurrence of double hepatic cancers is
worse than either HCC or ICC, and the origin of the disease needs further study.
