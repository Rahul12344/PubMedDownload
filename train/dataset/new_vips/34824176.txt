OBJECTIVE: The aim: This study was designed to investigate the potential role of 
miRNA-155 in the pathogenesis of HPV-induced cervical cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: A total of 42 formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cervical cancer tissue samples and 38 FFPE normal
cervical tissue samples were used (they were collected at the Department of
Pathology, Baghdad teaching hospital, Baghdad, Iraq, between January 2019 to
January 2021). Following HPV testing and genotyping, the expression of miRNA-155 
were evaluated by real-time PCR (qPCR).
RESULTS: Results: A statistically significant up-regulation of miRNA-155
expression was observed in cervical cancer tissues compared to results in control
group, regardless of HPV status and clinical grading.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: These data suggest that overexpression of miRNA-155 can 
delineate cervical cancer tissues from normal and may be a useful diagnostic
biomarker for early detection of cervical cancer.
