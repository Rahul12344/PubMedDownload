Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) remains a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in children. Various organisms cause LRTI, including viruses, bacteria,
fungi, and parasites, among others. Infections caused by 2 or more organisms also
occur, sometimes enhancing the severity of the infection. Medical imaging helps
confirm a diagnosis but also plays a role in the evaluation of acute and chronic 
sequelae. Medical imaging tests help evaluate underlying pathology in pediatric
patients with recurrent or long-standing symptoms as well as the
immunocompromised.
