Nowadays, rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract viruses is an urgent 
need to prevent another epidemic outbreak. To overcome this problem, we have
developed a clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)
loop mediated amplification (LAMP) technology to detect influenza A virus,
influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial A virus, respiratory syncytial B virus, 
and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, including variants of
concern (B.1.1.7), which utilized CRISPR-associated protein 12a (Cas12a) to
advance LAMP technology with the sensitivity increased 10 times. To reduce
aerosol contamination in CRISPR-LAMP technology, an
uracil-DNA-glycosylase-reverse transcription-LAMP system was also developed which
can effectively remove dUTP-incorporated LAMP amplicons. In vitro Cas12a cleavage
reaction with 28 crRNAs showed that there were no position constraints for
Cas12a/CRISPR RNA (crRNA) recognition and cleavage in LAMP amplicons, and even
the looped position of LAMP amplicons could be effectively recognized and
cleaved. Wild-type or spike N501Y can be detected with a limit of detection of 10
copies/Î¼L (wild-type) even at a 1% ratio level on the background (spike N501Y).
Combining UDG-RT-LAMP technology, CRISPR-LAMP design, and mutation detection
design, we developed a CRISPR-LAMP detection platform that can precisely diagnose
pathogens with better stability and significantly improved point mutation
detection efficiency.
