Breast radiologists are increasingly seeing patients with axillary adenopathy
related to COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination can cause levels I-III axillary as
well as cervical lymphadenopathy. Appropriate management of vaccine-related
adenopathy may vary depending on clinical context. In patients with current or
past history of malignancy, vaccine-related adenopathy can be indistinguishable
from nodal metastasis. This article presents imaging findings of oncology
patients with adenopathy seen in the axilla or neck on cross-sectional imaging
(breast MRI, CT, or PET-CT) after COVID-19 vaccination. Management approach and
rationale is discussed, along with consideration on strategies to minimize false 
positives in vaccinated cancer patients. Time interval between vaccination and
adenopathy seen on breast MRI, CT, or PET-CT is also reported.
