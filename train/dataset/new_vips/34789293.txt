BACKGROUND: We report a genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating
in Paraná, southern Brazil, from March 2020 to April 2021. Our analysis, based on
333 genomes, revealed that the first variants detected in the state of Paraná in 
March 2020 were the B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28 variants. The variants B.1.1.28 and
B.1.1.33 were predominant throughout 2020 until the introduction of the variant
P.2 in August 2020 and a variant of concern (VOC), Gamma (P.1), in January 2021. 
The VOC Gamma, a ramification of the B.1.1.28 lineage first detected in Manaus
(northern Brazil), has grown rapidly since December 2020 and was thought to be
responsible for the deadly second wave of COVID-19 throughout Brazil.
METHODS: The 333 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 to April 2021
were generated as part of the genomic surveillance carried out by Fiocruz in
Brazil Genomahcov Fiocruz. SARS-CoV-2 sequencing was performed using
representative samples from all geographic areas of Paraná. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed using the 333 genomes also included other SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 
the state of Paraná and other states in Brazil that were deposited in the GISAID.
In addition, the time-scaled phylogenetic tree was constructed with up to 3
random sequences of the Gamma variant from each state in Brazil in each month of 
2021. In this analysis we also added the sequences identified as the B.1.1.28
lineage of the Amazonas state and and the Gamma-like-II (P.1-like-II) lineage
identified in different regions of Brazil.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were previously
classified as the VOC Gamma lineage by WHO/PANGO showed that some genomes from
February to April 2021 branched in a monophyletic clade and that these samples
grouped together with genomes recently described with the lineage Gamma-like-II. 
Additionally, a new mutation (E661D) in the spike (S) protein has been identified
in nearly 10% of the genomes classified as the VOC Gamma from Paraná in March and
April 2021.Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the lineage and the Gamma
variant frequency, age group (patients younger or older than 60 years old) and
the clinical data of 86 cases from the state of Paraná.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided a reliable picture of the evolution of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the state of Paraná characterized by the dominance of the 
Gamma strain, as well as a high frequencies of the Gamma-like-II lineage and the 
S:E661D mutation. Epidemiological and genomic surveillance efforts should be
continued to unveil the biological relevance of the novel mutations detected in
the VOC Gamma in Paraná.
