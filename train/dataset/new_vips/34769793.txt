The SARS COVID-19 pandemic emerged in 2019 and has impacted people everywhere.
Disparities in impact and outcomes are becoming apparent for individuals and
communities which go beyond the trajectory of the disease itself, influenced by
the strength and weaknesses of systems of universal health care, and the actions 
of civil society and government. This article is one of a series exploring
COVID-19-related experiences of assistive technology (AT) users across the globe 
and implications for AT systems strengthening. AT such as mobility products,
braille devices, and information communication technologies are key enablers of
functioning, necessary to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals
and enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Reporting on a survey of 73 AT users across six global regions, we demonstrate
that minority groups already living with health inequities are unduly impacted.
An AT ecosystem analysis was conducted using the WHO GATE 5P framework, that is, 
people, products, personnel, provision and policy. AT users and families call for
inclusive pandemic responses which encompass their needs across the lifespan,
from very young to very old. We offer specific recommendations for future action 
to strengthen access to AT across public policy and civil society in pandemic
preparedness and response.
