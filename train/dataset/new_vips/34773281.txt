BACKGROUND & AIMS: Free treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with
direct-acting antivirals became widespread in Spain in April 2015. We aimed to
test whether, after this intervention, there was a more favorable change in
population mortality from HCV-related than from non-HCV-related causes.
APPROACH & RESULTS: Post-intervention changes in mortality were assessed using
uncontrolled before-after and single-group interrupted time series designs. All
residents in Spain during 2001-2018 were included. Various underlying death
causes were analyzed: HCV infection, other HCV-related outcomes (hepatocellular
carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, and HIV disease); and non-C hepatitis, other liver
diseases, and non-hepatic causes as control outcomes. Changes in mortality after 
the intervention were first assessed by rate ratios (RR) between the post and
pre-intervention age-standardized mortality rates. Subsequently, using
Quasi-Poisson segmented regression models, we estimated the annual percent change
(APC) in mortality rate in post- and pre-intervention periods. All mortality
rates were lower during the post-intervention period, although RRs were much
lower for HCV [0.53, 95% Confidence Interval -95%CI-: 0.51, 0.56] and HIV disease
than other causes. After the intervention there was a great acceleration of the
downward mortality trend from HCV, whose APC went from -3.2% [95%CI: -3.6%,
-2.8%] to -18.4% [95%CI: -20.6%, -16.3%]. There were also significant
accelerations in the downward trends in mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma
and HIV disease, while they remained unchanged for cirrhosis and slowed or
reversed for other causes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the favorable changes in HCV-related
mortality observed for Spain after April 2015 are attributable to scaling up free
treatment with direct-acting antivirals and reinforce that HCV eradication is on 
the horizon.
