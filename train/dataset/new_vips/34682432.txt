Changes in health-seeking behaviours and challenges in accessing care have been
reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study examines Australian
experiences related to healthcare access during the early months of the pandemic.
The study aimed to identify key areas of concern as well as opportunities for
services to prevent, manage and treat health concerns when normal access was
disrupted. Fifty-nine semi-structured interviews were analysed. Participants were
interviewed between August and December in 2020 over telephone or Zoom and were
located across Australia. Rapid identification of themes with an audio recordings
technique was used to generate themes from the data. Participants described a
variety of influences on their health-seeking behaviours, resulting in decisions 
to delay care or being unable to reach care. Many individuals accessed health
services via telehealth and offered a range of perceptions and views on its
effectiveness and appropriateness. The findings illustrate that maintenance of
health and access to healthcare and psychosocial support were compromised for
some individuals, leading to negative impacts on both mental and physical health.
This highlights the need to provide mechanisms to facilitate a person's ability
to access care in a timely manner during a pandemic.
