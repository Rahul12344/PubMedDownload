Legionella pneumophila (LP) widely exists in natural and artificial water
environments, which facilitates LP to infect people. LP infection causes
Legionnaires' disease (LD), which is an important but relatively uncommon
respiratory infection. Approximately 90% of LD is caused by L. pneumophila
serogroup 1 (Lp1). Meteorological conditions may affect the infectivity and
virulence of Lp1, but the exact relationship between them is still unclear. In
this study, we evaluated the virulence of Lp1 by screening of total 156 Lp1
strains isolated from cooling tower water in different region of China by
detecting their abilities to activate NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in vitro. In
addition, we screened the distribution of some selected virulence genes in these 
strains. The virulence, virulence gene distribution and the meteorological
factors were analyzed. We found that both the virulence and the distribution of
virulence genes had a certain regional and meteorological correlation. Although
loss of several virulence genes showed significant effects on the virulence of
Lp1 strains, the distribution of virulence genes had very limited effects on the 
virulence of Lp1. IMPORTANCE LD is likely to be under-recognized in many
countries. Due to the widespread existence of LP in natural and artificial water 
environments, and to the lack of cross-protection against different strains, LP
is a potentially serious threat to human health. Therefore, effective monitoring 
of the virulence of LP in the water environment is very important to prevent and 
control the prevalence of LD. Understanding the virulence of LP can not only help
us to predict the risk of possible outbreaks in advance, but can also enable more
targeted clinical treatment. This study highlights the importance of
understanding the epidemiology and ecology of LP isolated from public facilities 
in terms of public health and biology. Due to the potential for water sources to 
harbor and disseminate LP, and to the fact that geographical conditions influence
the virulence of LP, timely and accurate LP virulence surveillance is urgently
needed.
