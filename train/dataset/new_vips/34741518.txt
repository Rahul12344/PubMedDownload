BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an arboviral disease that is focally
endemic in parts of Europe and Asia. TBE cases among US travellers are rare, with
previous reports of only six cases among civilian travellers through 2009 and
nine military-related cases through 2020. A TBE vaccine was licenced in the USA
in August 2021. Understanding TBE epidemiology and risks among US travellers can 
help with the counselling of travellers going to TBE-endemic areas.
METHODS: Diagnostic testing for TBE in the USA is typically performed at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because no commercial testing is
available. Diagnostic testing for TBE at CDC since 2010 was reviewed. For
individuals with evidence of TBE virus infection, information was gathered on
demographics, clinical presentations and risk factors for infection.
RESULTS: From 2010-20, six patients with TBE were identified. Cases occurred
among both paediatric and adult travellers and all were male. Patients were
diagnosed with meningitis (n = 2) or encephalitis (n = 4); none died. Cases had
travelled to various countries in Europe or Russia. Three cases reported visiting
friends or relatives. Activities reported included hiking, camping, trail
running, or working outdoors, and two cases had a recognized tick bite.
CONCLUSIONS: TBE cases among US travellers are uncommon, with these six cases
being the only known TBE cases among civilian travellers during this 11-year
period. Nonetheless, given potential disease severity, pre-travel counselling for
travellers to TBE-endemic areas should include information on measures to reduce 
the risk for TBE and other tick-borne diseases, including possible TBE vaccine
use if a traveller's itinerary puts them at higher risk for infection. Clinicians
should consider the diagnosis of TBE in a patient with a neurologic or febrile
illness recently returned from a TBE-endemic country, particularly if a tick bite
or possible tick exposure is reported.
