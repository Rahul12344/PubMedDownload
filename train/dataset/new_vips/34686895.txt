Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus that causes
acute watery diarrhea and vomiting in unweaned piglets, and is associated with
high mortality, thus causing severe economic losses in the pig industry.
Currently, although attenuated vaccines are commonly used in commercial pig farms
in China, they do not completely protect against all mutated wild-type strains.
Existing nucleic acid assays have high sensitivity and specificity, but the
complexity of the assay process and expensive instrumentation hinder disease
detection. Here, reverse transcription-enzymatic recombinase amplification
(RT-ERA) was combined with the CRISPR-Cas12a system to develop a rapid diagnostic
method to distinguish PEDV wild-type strains from attenuated vaccine strains. The
protocol used crRNA and RT-ERA amplification primers against open reading frame 3
(ORF3), followed by Cas12a/crRNA complex detection of predefined target sequences
at 37 °C for 30 min, thus producing results visible to the naked eye under LED
blue light. The assay is highly sensitive and specific, detecting as few as two
copies of the target gene per test and showing no cross-reactivity with other
porcine pathogens. Overall, this integrated RT-ERA pre-amplification and
Cas12a/crRNA cleavage assay is a practical tool for reliable and rapid detection 
of PEDV for diagnostic differentiation.
