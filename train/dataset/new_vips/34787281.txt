The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that the prescription of
remdesivir should be cautious for patients with estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) < 30 and some studies reported risk of adverse renal events. The
available information on the renal safety profile for remdesivir is limited, thus
we analyzed the renal and urinary adverse reactions attributed to remdesivir
reported in a large open pharmacovigilance database. We obtained reports of
remdesivir and other drugs used to treat COVID-19 (tocilizumab,
hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir) registered by September 30 2020, from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We 
analyzed the reporting odds ratios (RORs) for reports of adverse renal and
urinary events for remdesivir and other drugs. We found 2,922 reports with
remdesivir registered in FAERS for COVID-19. Among these, 493 renal and urinary
adverse effects (16.9%) were reported. The most frequent events were acute kidney
injury (338; 11.6%), renal impairment (86; 2.9%), and renal failure (53; 1.8%).
Versus hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, or tocilizumab, the use of
remdesivir was associated with an increased chance of reporting renal and urinary
disorders regardless of gender and age of patients (2.53; 95%CI: 2.10-3.06). The 
ROR remained significant when we restricted the analysis to hydroxychloroquine
(4.31; 95%CI: 3.25-5.71) or tocilizumab (3.92; 95%CI: 2.51-6.12). Our results
reinforce this already reported signal, emphasizing that it could be extremely
useful for health professionals who prescribe this new antiviral to treat
COVID-19, mainly knowing its low efficacy.
