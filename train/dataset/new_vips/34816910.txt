OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the indicators of
urban mobility and the number of new cases of COVID-19 recorded daily between
2020 and 2021.
METHODS: An observational study was carried out involving new cases of COVID-19
registered daily in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil between March 12, 2020 and
March 28, 2021 and six indicators of urban mobility. For analysis, the study was 
divided into two periods: the first was composed of 295 days and represents the
year 2020 and the second was composed of 86 days and represents the year 2021.
Spearman's non-parametric correlation was used.
RESULTS: In 2021, the greatest reductions in relation to the baseline were
observed in parks (-29.0) and in retail and recreation areas (-28.7). However,
these reductions were smaller than those observed in the previous year,
indicating a greater circulation of people in 2021 when compared with mobility in
2020. In contrast, in residential areas, there was a reduction in the percentage 
change in relation to the previous year (11.2 in 2019 and 7.6 in 2021). In
grocery and pharmacy, there was an increase 1.8 times greater than that observed 
in 2020 (9.1 in 2020 and 17.0 in 2021). It is also noteworthy that the daily
average of new cases almost doubled in value (753.4 in 2020 and 1409.1 in 2021).
CONCLUSION: More vigorous measures must be taken to adequately control the
pandemic.
