BACKGROUND: Bavachin, a flavonoid compound isolated from the seeds and fruits of 
Psoralea corylifolia l. (family Fabaceae), is used as a traditional medicine in
Asia. Indeed, it is reported to have various medicinal functions such as
estrogenic and antiinflammatory activities among others. However, to date, the
effects of bavachin on T cell activation have yet to be reported.
PURPOSE AND STUDY DESIGN: We aimed to determine the effects of bavachin on the
activation of a human T cell line in vitro and on antigen-specific immune
responses in mice in vivo.
METHODS: In a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity assay, the
Jurkat T cell line expressing a luciferase reporter driven by an NFAT-response
element was stimulated with antihuman CD3/CD28 antibody and bavachin.
Furthermore, the level of cytokine production was measured in the Jurkat T cell
line stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin and bavachin using
an IL-2 ELISA and a cytometric bead array assay. For in vivo analyses, mice were 
subcutaneously immunized with an antigen (ovalbumin protein) and bavachin, and
the immune responses of mice were analyzed by FACS analysis, a T cell
proliferation assay, a cytokine ELISA, and an antiovalbumin-specific antibody
ELISA.
RESULTS: We found that bavachin activated NFAT-mediated transcription in the
human T cell line in vitro. In mice, when bavachin was administered with the
antigen, an increase in T cell responses and antibody production specific to the 
antigen was observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that bavachin has immunoadjuvant and
immunomodulation effects, which arise through activation of the NFAT signaling
pathway.
