The current study evaluated the progress of continuum healthcare for patients
living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from Cluj County in two 
moments, 2016 and 2020, and compared the results to the Fast-Track targets (FTTs)
proposed by the Joint United Nations Programme (UNAIDS) on HIV/AIDS. By the end
of 2020, 368 out of 385 confirmed HIV-positive patients from Cluj County were
under surveillance in our center, representing almost 95% of the patients living 
with HIV and knowing their diagnosis, compared to 87.9% in 2016. Nearly 97% of
those in active follow-up from Cluj County were under antiretroviral therapy
(ART) in 2020, compared to 89% in 2016. The number of virally suppressed patients
from those under ART was almost 94% in 2020, compared to 82.7% in 2016, and the
increase is observed regardless of the ART regime. A shift towards integrase
strand transfer inhibitors, with a higher efficacy, fewer adverse effects, and
fewer drug interactions, is observed, which could contribute to the decrease in
HIV transmission.
