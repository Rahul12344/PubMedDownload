Although several non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) technologies have been widely
investigated in air treatment, very few studies have focused on the inactivation 
mechanism of viruses by NTPs. Due to its efficiency and environmental
compatibility, non-thermal plasma could be considered a promising
virus-inactivation technology. Plasma is a partly or fully ionized gas including 
some species (i.e., electrons, free radicals, ions, and neutral molecules) to
oxidize pollutants or inactivate harmful organisms. Non-thermal plasmas are made 
using less energy and have an active electron at a much higher temperature than
bulk gas molecules. This review describes NTPs for virus inactivation in indoor
air. The different application processes of plasma for microorganism inactivation
at both laboratory and pilot-scale was also reviewed This paper reports on recent
advances in this exciting area of viral inactivation identifying applications and
mechanisms of inactivation, and summarizing the results of the latest experiments
in the literature. Moreover, special attention was paid to the mechanism of virus
inactivation. Finally, the paper suggests research directions in the field of
airborne virus inactivation using non-thermal plasma.
