Social distancing was universally implemented to reduce the spread of the
COVID-19 virus. Long-term social distancing can lead to increased feelings of
social isolation or dissatisfaction with one's daily interpersonal interactions, 
which can subsequently result in reduced psychological health (e.g., greater
depression). The present study quantified this association, and the extent to
which it was moderated by measures of sleep and physical activity, by surveying
3658 adults (mean age = 46.0 years) from across the United States. Participants
answered questions related to their social experiences, sleep, physical activity,
and depressive symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic (March-June
2020). Results showed that social isolation and social dissatisfaction were
associated with greater depressive symptoms. As predicted, self-reported sleep
quality and physical activity moderated these associations, such that lower sleep
quality and physical activity exacerbated their effect on depressive symptoms.
