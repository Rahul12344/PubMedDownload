Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease
caused by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). The first clinical CCHF 
infection was described in 1944 in the Crimean Peninsula, exclusively in humans, 
with case-fatality rates exceeding 30%. The increasing number of cases, high
mortality rate, and lack of effective therapy make CCHF a serious threat to
public health and a potential bioterrorism agent. The present study evaluated the
development, immunogenicity, and immune response durations for
cell-culture-derived inactivated vaccine (CCVax) formulations in comparison with 
those of mouse-brain-derived vaccine (MBVax) formulations. In this study, the
Kelkit06 CCHF virus strain was propagated in both suckling mice and Vero E6
cells, and purified with a sucrose gradient. Formalin-inactivated vaccine
candidates were formulated at various doses [low dose (LD), 5 μg; medium dose
(MD), 10 μg; high dose (HD), 20 μg)] and mixed with an alum adjuvant. BALB/c mice
received the same doses of the vaccine formulations three times at 3-week
intervals. The humoral endpoint IgG responses were evaluated and compared for the
MBVax and CCVax treatments. The duration of the presence of IgG and neutralizing 
antibody (Ab) titers was evaluated and compared until up to 1 year after
immunization. The humoral IgG responses indicated that the CCVax and MBVax
candidates enhanced the IgG endpoint titers in a dose-dependent manner, which
were induced more strongly in all the CCVax groups than in the MBVax mice. The
fold changes in neutralizing Ab levels were also found to be higher in the CCVax 
groups: between 2- and 7.6-fold after the second week of the last immunization.
The neutralization titers peaked 4 months after immunization in all the
vaccine-receiving groups, but these were still comparable at the end of the first
year. The CCVax formulations induced higher IgG and neutralizing Ab titers at all
the measured time points. In this study, we showed that cell-culture-purified and
formalin-inactivated vaccine candidates induced strong and robust immunity in
vaccinated mice dose-dependently, more so than mouse-brain-derived vaccines.
