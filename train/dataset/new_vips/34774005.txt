BACKGROUND: Kidney dysfunction occurs in severe COVID-19, and is a predictor of
COVID-19 mortality. Whether kidney dysfunction causes severe COVID-19, and hence 
is a target of intervention, or whether it is a symptom, is unclear because
conventional observational studies are open to confounding. To obtain
unconfounded estimates, we used Mendelian randomization to examine the role of
kidney function in severe COVID-19.
METHODS: We used genome-wide significant, uncorrelated genetic variants to
predict kidney function, in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and then assessed whether people
with genetically instrumented higher eGFR or lower UACR, an indication of better 
kidney function, had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 (8779 cases, 1,001,875
controls), using the largest available cohorts with extensive genotyping. For
comprehensiveness, we also examined their role in COVID-19 hospitalization
(24,274 cases, 2,061,529 controls) and all COVID-19 (1,12,612 cases, 2,474,079
controls).
RESULTS: Genetically instrumented higher eGFR was associated with lower risk of
severe COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83, 0.98)
but not related to COVID-19 hospitalization or infection. Genetically
instrumented UACR was not related to COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney function appears to be one of the key targets for severe
COVID-19 treatment. Use of available medications to improve kidney function, such
as antihypertensives, might be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment, with relevance 
to drug repositioning.
