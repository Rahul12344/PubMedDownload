While the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 disease progression in the
general population has been largely assessed, its impact on HIV-positive
individuals remains unclear. We present clinical and immunological data collected
in a cohort of HIV-infected young individuals during the first wave of COVID-19
pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 RNA, virus-specific antibodies, as well as the expression of
factors involved in the anti-viral immune response were analyzed. Moreover, we
set up an in vitro coinfection assay to study the mechanisms correlated to the
coinfection process. Our results did not show any increased risk of severe
COVID-19 in HIV-positive young individuals. In those subjects who contracted
SARS-CoV-2 infection, an increase in IL-10 expression and production was
observed. Furthermore, in the in vitro coinfection assay, we revealed a reduction
in SARS-CoV-2 replication associated to an upregulation of IL-10. We speculate
that IL-10 could play a crucial role in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
HIV-positive individuals. These results might help defining clinical management
of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infected young individuals, or putative indications for
vaccination schedules in this population.
