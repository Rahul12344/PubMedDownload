The ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana is responsible for the 
development of flat, symmetric, and extended leaf laminae and their vein systems.
AS2 protein is a member of the plant-specific AS2/LOB protein family, which
includes 42 members comprising the conserved amino-terminal domain referred to as
the AS2/LOB domain, and the variable carboxyl-terminal region. Among the members,
AS2 has been most intensively investigated on both genetic and molecular levels. 
AS2 forms a complex with the myb protein AS1, and is involved in epigenetic
repression of the abaxial genes ETTIN/AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ETT/ARF3), ARF4,
and class 1 KNOX homeobox genes. The repressed expression of these genes by AS2
is markedly enhanced by the cooperative action of various modifier genes, some of
which encode nucleolar proteins. Further downstream, progression of the cell
division cycle in the developing organs is stimulated; meristematic states are
suppressed in determinate leaf primordia; and the extension of leaf primordia is 
induced. AS2 binds the specific sequence in exon 1 of ETT/ARF3 and maintains
methylated CpGs in several exons of ETT/ARF3. AS2 forms bodies (designated as AS2
bodies) at nucleolar peripheries. AS2 bodies partially overlap chromocenters,
including inactive 45S ribosomal DNA repeats, suggesting the presence of
molecular and functional links among AS2, the 45S rDNAs, and the nucleolus to
exert the repressive regulation of ETT/ARF3. The AS2/LOB domain is characterized 
by three subdomains, the zinc finger (ZF) motif, the internally conserved-glycine
containing (ICG) region, and the leucine-zipper-like (LZL) region. Each of these 
subdomains is essential for the formation of AS2 bodies. ICG to LZL are required 
for nuclear localization, but ZF is not. LZL intrinsically has the potential to
be exported to the cytoplasm. In addition to its nuclear function, it has been
reported that AS2 plays a positive role in geminivirus infection: its protein BV1
stimulates the expression of AS2 and recruits AS2 to the cytoplasm, which
enhances virus infectivity by suppression of cytoplasmic post transcriptional
gene silencing.
