Sheep pox, goat pox, and lumpy skin diseases are economically significant and
contagious viral diseases of sheep, goats and cattle, respectively, caused by the
genus Capripoxvirus (CaPV) of the family Poxviridae. Currently, CaPV infection of
small ruminants (sheep and goats) has been distributed widely and are prevalent
in Central Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. This disease poses
challenges to food production and distribution, affecting rural livelihoods in
most African countries, including Ethiopia. Transmission occurs mainly by direct 
or indirect contact with infected animals. They cause high morbidity (75-100% in 
endemic areas) and mortality (10-85%). Additionally, the mortality rate can
approach 100% in susceptible animals. Diagnosis largely relies on clinical
symptoms, confirmed by laboratory testing using real-time PCR, electron
microscopy, virus isolation, serology and histology. Control and eradication of
sheep pox virus (SPPV), goat pox virus (GTPV), and lumpy skin disease (LSDV)
depend on timely recognition of disease eruption, vector control, and movement
restriction. To date, attenuated vaccines originating from KSGPV O-180 strains
are effective and widely used in Ethiopia to control CaPV throughout the country.
This vaccine strain is clinically safe to control CaPV in small ruminants but not
in cattle which may be associated with insufficient vaccination coverage and the 
production of low-quality vaccines.
