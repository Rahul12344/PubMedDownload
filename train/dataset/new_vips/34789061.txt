BACKGROUND: Most COVID-19 patients experience a mild course of the disease and
can be managed in general practice. However, in the early pandemic, most research
was conducted in secondary care.
OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to identify original research published
within the first year of the pandemic relevant to general practice regarding
symptomatic, non-hospitalised patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease to 
provide an overview of published research.
METHODS: PubMed was searched for studies written in English, Swedish, Danish, or 
Norwegian published before 1 April 2021. Two authors screened all titles and
abstracts and identified full texts.
RESULTS: We screened 1303 titles and abstracts and retrieved 128 full texts. An
additional 44 full-texts were obtained from references. After full-text reading, 
79 articles were included, six of which were conducted in general practice, 20 in
the community, 42 in hospitals, and 11 in other settings. Therapy and harm were
investigated in randomised controlled trials in 11 out of 17 studies; the
diagnosis was investigated using a diagnostic accuracy design in four out of 26
studies and prognosis in prospective studies in 10 out of 21 studies. The
remaining 15 studies had other research questions.
CONCLUSION: Although general practitioners in most countries must have been
involved in managing patients with COVID-19, little research has been published
from general practice during the first year of the pandemic. General practice
research environments must be able to respond quickly in case of future
pandemics.
