There is strong evidence that serum free bilirubin concentration has significant 
effects on morbidity and mortality in the most significant health conditions of
our times, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity/metabolic
syndrome. Supplementation of bilirubin in animal and experimental models has
reproduced these protective effects, but several factors have slowed the
application bilirubin as a therapeutic agent in human patients. Bilirubin is
poorly soluble in water, and is a complex molecule that is difficult to
synthesize. Current sources of this molecule are animal-derived, creating
concerns regarding the risk of virus or prion transmission. However, recent
developments in nanoparticle drug delivery, biosynthetic strategies, and drug
synthesis have opened new avenues for applying bilirubin as a pharmaceutical
agent. This article reviews the chemistry and physiology of bilirubin, potential 
clinical applications and summarizes current strategies for safe and efficient
drug delivery.
