BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) are at high risk of Hepatitis B virus
(HBV) transmission. Hepatitis B vaccination is effective in protecting against
HBV infection. Different factors influence HCW vaccination status such as lack of
knowledge & awareness, cost, availability, and hesitancy. This study aimed to
determine Hepatitis B vaccination status and factors influencing vaccination
status in HCWs of two secondary care hospitals at Sindh, Pakistan.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two secondary care hospitals of
Sindh, Pakistan. A total of 252 doctors, nurses, laboratory, and other HCWs were 
asked about the HBV vaccination coverage using a structured tool. Multivariable
ordinal logistic regression was used to determine the association of
participant's characteristics, vaccination knowledge with HBV vaccination
coverage considering p-value â‰¤0.05 significant. Odds ratios with 95% confidence
interval (CI) were reported.
RESULTS: Our study found that 64.9% doctors, 75.18% nurses, 58.3% allied HCWs,
40.0% laboratory staff, and 70.8% housekeeping staff were completely vaccinated. 
HCWs stated job entry requirement as the primary reason for complete vaccination 
(AOR 4.6, 95% CI 1.5-5.3) from the disease. HCWs working in Aga Khan hospital
Karachi and who have received vaccination before working in that hospital had
four-time higher odds for hepatitis B vaccination (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.7-4.9).
CONCLUSION: Two-third of the HCWs were completely vaccinated in secondary care
hospitals in Sindh, Pakistan. Hepatitis B vaccination should be made a job entry 
requirement to achieve more complete vaccination numbers. Vaccination policies
require to implement for all part-timers and full-timer health care workers.
