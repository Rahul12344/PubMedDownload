Annual unpredictable efficacy of vaccines, coupled with emerging drug resistance,
underlines the development of new antiviral drugs to treat influenza infections. 
The N-terminal domain of the PA (PAN) endonuclease is both highly conserved
across influenza strains and serotypes and is indispensable for the viral
lifecycle, making it an attractive target for new antiviral therapies. Here, we
describe the discovery of a new class of PAN inhibitors derived from recently
identified, highly active hits for PAN endonuclease inhibition. By use of
structure-guided design and systematic SAR exploration, the hits were elaborated 
through a fragment growing strategy, giving rise to a series of 1,
3-cis-2-substituted-1-(3, 4-dihydroxybenzyl)-6, 7-dihydroxy-1, 2, 3,
4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potent PAN inhibitors. 
This approach ultimately resulted in the development of a new lead compound 13e, 
which exhibited an EC50 value of 4.50 μM against H1N1 influenza virus in MDCK
cells.
