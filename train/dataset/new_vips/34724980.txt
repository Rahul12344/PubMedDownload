BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) pandemic has underscored the
need to expedite clinical research, which may lead investigators to shift away
from measuring patient-important outcomes (PIO), limiting research applicability.
We aim to investigate if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of covid-19
pharmacological therapies include PIOs.
METHODS: We will perform a meta-epidemiological study of RCTs that included
people at risk for, or with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19, examining
any pharmacological treatment or blood product aimed at prophylaxis or treatment.
We will obtain data from all RCTs identified in a living network metanalysis
(NMA). The main data sources are the living WHO covid-19 database up to 1 March
2021 and six additional Chinese databases up to 20 February 2021. Two reviewers
independently will review each citation, full-text article, and abstract data. To
categorize the outcomes according to their importance to patients, we will adapt 
a previously defined hierarchy: a) mortality, b) quality of life/ functional
status/symptoms, c) morbidity, and d) surrogate outcomes. Outcomes within the
category a) and b) will be considered critically important to patients, and
outcomes within the category c) will be regarded as important. We will use
descriptive statistics to assess the proportion of studies that report each
category of outcomes. We will perform univariable and multivariable analysis to
explore associations between trial characteristics and the likelihood of
reporting PIOs.
DISCUSSION: The findings from this meta-epidemiological study will help health
care professionals and researchers understand if the current covid-19 trials are 
effectively assessing and reporting the outcomes that are important to patients. 
If a deficiency in capturing PIOs is identified, this information may help inform
the development of future RCTs in covid-19.
