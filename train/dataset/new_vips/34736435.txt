BACKGROUND: Serological testing for the presence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
markers and anti-HBs titers in infants born to HBsAg positive women is critically
important for estimation in immunisation programme.
METHODS: This was a multi-center and cross-sectional study conducted in Zhejiang 
province, China. Children aged 7 to 24 months born to HBsAg positive women during
December 2018 to February 2019, completed additional HBV serological markers
screening. We indicated distribution of HBV serological markers and anti-HBs
titers in children. Multiple logistic regression model with adjusted odds ratio
and 95% confidence interval (ORadj and 95% CI) was used to explore the factors
associated with inadequate immune response (anti-HBs titers< 100 mIU/ml) among
children.
RESULTS: A total of 1849 children were included. Overall 25 children tested HBsAg
positive, giving HBsAg positive rate of 1.35%(95%CI: 0.83-1.88%). 92.00% (23/25) 
HBsAg positive children were delivered by HBeAg positive mothers. The proportion 
of protective seroconversion (anti-HBs titers≥10mIU/ml) was 99.29% in all
children, and 86.48% children were reported with adequate anti-HBs titers
(≥100mIU/ml).We found a significant higher proportions of early antenatal health 
care (< 13 gestational weeks), and term birth in children with adequate response 
compared with inadequate response (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression showed
preterm birth was a negative factor for inadequate anti-HBs titers
(ORadj = 1.868,95%CI 1.132-3.085,P = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Children delivered by HBeAg positive mothers had higher risk of
vertical transmission of HBV, despite completion of 3 doses of hepatitis B
vaccine and HBIG injection. Inadequate anti-HBs level was significantly
associated with preterm birth in HBsAg positive women.
