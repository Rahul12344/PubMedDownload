Bats are considered ideal reservoirs for zoonotic viruses with emerging
capabilities over the past two decades and spotted evidence points out that they 
may play a role as a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the possible
role of bats as part of SARS-CoV-2 anthropozoonotic spill-over infections in
Egypt, a total of 800 samples obtained from 200 Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus
aegyptiacus) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative RT-PCR assay
(RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from bat tissues showed no positive 
results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. These findings suggest that during the study
period, the Rousettus aegyptiacus bat was not a reservoir or amplifying host for 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in Egypt. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in Egyptian
fruit bats is thought to make a significant contribution to SARS-CoV-2
epidemiology.
