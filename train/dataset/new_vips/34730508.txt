BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States experience a
disproportionate burden of COVID-19 deaths.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether outcome differences between Hispanic and
non-Hispanic COVID-19 hospitalized patients exist and, if so, to identify the
main malleable contributing factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, cross-sectional, observational
study of 6097 adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized within a single large
healthcare system from March to November 2020.
EXPOSURES: Self-reported ethnicity and primary language.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) 
utilization and in-hospital death. We used age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and
multivariable analysis to evaluate the associations between ethnicity/language
groups and outcomes.
RESULTS: 32.1% of patients were Hispanic, 38.6% of whom reported a non-English
primary language. Hispanic patients were less likely to be insured, have a
primary care provider, and have accessed the healthcare system prior to the
COVID-19 admission. After adjusting for age, Hispanic inpatients experienced
higher ICU utilization (non-English-speaking: OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.47-2.08;
English-speaking: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95-1.33) and higher mortality
(non-English-speaking: OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.10-1.86; English-speaking: OR, 1.53;
95% CI, 1.19-1.98) compared to non-Hispanic inpatients. There were no observed
treatment disparities among ethnic groups. After adjusting for age, Hispanic
inpatients had elevated disease severity at admission (non-English-speaking: OR, 
2.27; 95% CI, 1.89-2.72; English-speaking: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.10- 1.61). In
multivariable analysis, the associations between ethnicity/language and clinical 
outcomes decreased after considering baseline disease severity (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: The associations between ethnicity and clinical outcomes can be
explained by elevated disease severity at admission and limited access to
healthcare for Hispanic patients, especially non-English-speaking Hispanics.
