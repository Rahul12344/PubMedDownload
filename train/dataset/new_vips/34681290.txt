The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created enormous societal disruptions in the Western 
world, including Canada, with serious implications for food safety. Since the
start of the pandemic, many scholars have investigated the issue of food safety
through different lenses. In this review, two research thrusts were identified,
the epidemiology of the virus and food safety oversight. Both were challenged by 
the pandemic in Canada and elsewhere. In this paper, we first present how Canada 
experienced the pandemic. We then present how epidemiology and food safety
oversight were affected by the virus and how the spread exposed gaps in Canada's 
food safety system. We explain how Canada was not adequately prepared to face the
food safety challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2. The review ends with an explanation
on how risk perceptions will be altered by the pandemic in Canada and how food
safety systems will adjust to better anticipate systemic risks in the future.
