Background: Resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) to HCV direct-acting
antivirals (DAAs) can contribute to virologic failure and limit retreatment
options. People who inject drugs (PWID) are at highest risk for transmission of
resistant virus. We report on RASs at baseline and after virologic failure in
DAA-naive and protease inhibitor-experienced PWID.
Methods: We sequenced the NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B regions from 150 PWID with
genotype 1 (GT1) viruses; 128 (85.3%) GT1a, 22 (14.7%) GT1b.
Results: Among the 139 (92.7%) DAA-naive PWID, 85 of 139 (61.2%) had baseline
RASs-67 of 139 (48.2%) in NS3 (predominantly Q80K/L); 25 of 139 (18.0%) in NS5A; 
and 8 of 139 (5.8%) in NS5B. Of the 11 protease inhibitor-experienced
participants, 9 had baseline NS3 RASs (V36L N = 1, Q80K N = 9) and 4 had baseline
NS5A RASs (M28V N = 2, H58P N = 1, A92T N = 1). Among the 11 participants who had
posttreatment samples with detectable virus (7 treatment failures, 1 late
relapse, 3 reinfections), 1 sofosbuvir/ledipasvir failure had a baseline H58P.
Two sofosbuvir/ledipasvir-treated participants developed new NS5A mutations
(Q30H, Y93H, L31M/V). Otherwise, no RASs were detected.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate RAS prevalence among DAA-naive PWID is
comparable to that in the general population. Only 2 of 150 (1.3%) in our
longitudinal cohort developed treatment-emergent RASs. Concern for transmission
of resistant virus may therefore be minimal.
