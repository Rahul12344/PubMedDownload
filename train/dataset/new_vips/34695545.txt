Genome editing in the lung has the potential to provide long-term expression of
therapeutic protein to treat lung genetic diseases. Yet efficient delivery of
CRISPR to the lung remains a challenge. The NIH Somatic Cell Genome Editing
(SCGE) Consortium is developing safe and effective methods for genome editing in 
disease tissues. Methods developed by consortium members are independently
validated by the SCGE small animal testing center to establish rigor and
reproducibility. We have developed and validated a dual adeno-associated virus
(AAV) CRISPR platform that supports effective editing of a lox-stop-lox-Tomato
reporter in mouse lung airway. After intratracheal injection of the AAV serotype 
5 (AAV5)-packaged S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), we
observed ∼19%-26% Tomato-positive cells in both large and small airways,
including club and ciliated epithelial cell types. This highly effective AAV
delivery platform will facilitate the study of therapeutic genome editing in the 
lung and other tissue types.
