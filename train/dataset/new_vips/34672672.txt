A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients during the pandemic
period.

Canakci E, Kaya M, Karatas A.

aimed to evaluate the laboratory parameters, risk factors, and success in
predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital's intensive
care units (ICUs).METHODS: Levels of procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, CRP and
albumin measured on days 1 and 7 were recorded. Patients were divided into two
groups as non-survivors and patients, who were discharged from ICUs. The
predictive values of laboratory parameters in predicting COVID-19 mortality were 
investigated.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was detected between the two
groups in the mean values of all laboratory parameters tested on days 1 and 7,
including D-dimer, procalcitonin, CRP, WBC, ferritin (excluding only D-dimer
levels and WBC counts on day 1; p=0.061 and p=0.243, respectively) (p<0.001,
p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.013, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001; 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: . It can be argued that procalcitonin, ferritin, and D-dimer can be
guiding parameters in predicting mortality in COVID-19 because their levels were 
found to be significantly higher in non-survivors. D-dimer, procalcitonin, and
ferritin showed an almost high level of sensitivity and specificity in predicting
mortality (Tab. 5, Fig. 3, Ref. 19).
