An 82-year-old man presented with intermittent episodes of slurred speech during 
his evening meals after receiving the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Thorough
evaluation was conducted including lab work and EMG confirming a new diagnosis of
late-onset myasthenia gravis. Despite treatment, the patient progressed rapidly
to severe exacerbation requiring intubation and placement of a PEG tube.
Infections provoking new diagnosis and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis have
been reported. New diagnosis of myasthenia gravis associated with the COVID-19
vaccine is rarely reported. This case highlights the need for clinicians to be
aware of the uncommon presenting symptoms in late-onset myasthenia gravis and the
possibility of vaccine provoked diagnoses of immune mediated diseases.
