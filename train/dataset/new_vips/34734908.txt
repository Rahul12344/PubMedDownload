INTRODUCTION: Protein S deficiency and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are
rare etiologies of ischemic stroke. We describe a case of an ischemic stroke
revealing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection 
in a patient with a history of protein S deficiency and cerebral imaging
suggestive of vasculitis.
CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman, with history of protein S deficiency, was
admitted for right hemiparesis and aphasia that happened 6 hours before her
consultation. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 11. She 
had hypoxia (SpO2 93%). COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction was positive. Cerebral
computed tomography scan showed an ischemic stroke in the territory of the
superficial left middle cerebral artery. The recommended time period for
thrombolysis was exceeded and we did not dispose of sufficient resources to
deliver thrombectomy. She was treated with aspirin, statins, antibiotic therapy, 
and oxygen. Considering the high risk of thromboembolic complications and the
history of protein S deficiency, anticoagulation treatment with heparin followed 
by acenocoumarol was started. Evolution was marked by the appearance of 24 hours 
regressive, acute symptoms of confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed 
new ischemic strokes in both anterior cerebral arteries and on magnetic resonance
angiography narrowing of the left internal carotid artery and both anterior
cerebral arteries suggestive of vasculitis was seen. We maintained
anticoagulation and prescribed methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days.
Evolution was marked by improvement of clinical deficit and respiratory status.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection potentializes the prothrombotic effect and
vascular inflammation by accentuating protein S deficit. The place of steroids
seems justifiable in the presence of symptoms of vasculitis in brain imaging.
