Resolvin D1 (RvD1), which is biosynthesized from essential long-chain fatty
acids, is involved in anti-inflammatory activity and modulation of T cell
response. Memory CD8+ T cells are important for controlling tumor growth and
viral infections. Exacerbated inflammation has been described as impairing memory
CD8+ T cell differentiation. This study aimed to verify the effects of RvD1 on
memory CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo in a respiratory virus infection model. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated at different time points with
RvD1 and stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. Pre-treatment with RvD1
increases the expansion of memory CD8+ T cells. The IL-12 level, a cytokine
described to control memory CD8+ T cells, was reduced with RvD1 pre-treatment.
When the mTOR axis was inhibited, the IL-12 levels were restored. In a
respiratory virus infection model, Balb/c mice were treated with RvD1 before
infection or after 7 days after infection. RvD1 treatment after infection
increased the frequency of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung expressing II4, II10, 
and Ifng. During reinfection, RvD1-treated and RSV-infected mice present a high
viral load in the lung and lower antibody response in the serum. Our results show
that RvD1 modulates the expansion and phenotype of memory CD8+ T cells but
contributed to a non-protective response after RSV reinfection.
