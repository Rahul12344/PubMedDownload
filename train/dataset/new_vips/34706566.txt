Providing music therapy in a medical setting has necessarily undergone major
changes during the COVID-19 world pandemic. Many programs had to discontinue
while others were able to transition to a telehealth model. This paper describes 
the process of conducting telehealth-based music therapy sessions within an
integrative oncology setting in a large cancer hospital. Patients provide
feedback regarding benefits and challenges of inpatient, outpatient, and group
music therapy using a telehealth model. Benefits include anxiety reduction,
increased coping skills, and increased social support. Unique challenges include 
technology limitations. We share examples of how we successfully adapted our
workflows to provide telehealth-based music therapy in inpatient, outpatient, and
group settings.
