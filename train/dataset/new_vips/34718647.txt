BACKGROUND: The underlying immunologic deficiencies enabling SARS-CoV-2
reinfection are currently unknown. We describe deep longitudinal immune profiling
of a transplant recipient hospitalized twice for COVID-19.
METHODS: A 66-year-old male renal transplant recipient was hospitalized with
COVID-19 March 2020 then readmitted to the hospital with COVID-19 233 days after 
initial diagnosis. Virologic and immunologic investigation were performed on
samples from the primary and secondary infections.
RESULTS: Whole viral genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis revealed that
viruses causing both infections were caused by distinct genetic lineages without 
evidence of immune escape mutations. Longitudinal comparison of cellular and
humoral responses during primary SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that this patient 
responded to the primary infection with low neutralization titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies that were likely present at the time of reinfection.
DISCUSSION: The development of neutralizing antibodies and humoral memory
responses in this patient failed to confer protection against reinfection,
suggesting that they were below a neutralizing titer threshold or that additional
factors may be required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.
Development of poorly neutralizing antibodies may have been due to profound and
relatively specific reduction in naïve CD4 T-cell pools. Seropositivity alone may
not be a perfect correlate of protection in immunocompromised patients.
