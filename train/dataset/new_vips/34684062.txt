Our study aimed to evaluate the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies 
of IL-6 597A/G (rs1800797) and 174G/C (rs1800795) polymorphisms in HPV infected
and uninfected healthy women and cervical cancer patients. A PCR based Multiplex 
HPV genotyping test kit was used for in vitro detection and differentiation of
high risk HPV genotypes. Genotyping of two polymorphisms, IL-6 597A/G (rs1800797)
and 174G/C (rs1800795), was performed using the KASP genotyping assay kit.
Cervical cancer patients were more likely to be HPV positive than control
patients. Allele C of IL-6 rs1800795 was associated with a higher risk of
cervical cancer by 2.26-fold and genotype CC by 5.37-fold. Genotype CC of IL-6
rs1800795 was more frequent in the HPV positive group compared with the HPV
negative group (p = 0.002). Allele G of IL-6 rs1800797 was more frequently found 
in women with HPV16/HPV18 compared to other HPV types (p = 0.045). Women with AA 
genotypes of IL-6 rs1800797 were less frequently infected with HPV16/HPV18
compared to other HPV types (p = 0.045). The major finding of the study is the
significant association of C allele and CC genotype of IL-6 1800795 gene with
cervical cancer in the Lithuanian population. Genotype CC of IL-6 rs1800795 has a
significant association with HPV infection as well.
