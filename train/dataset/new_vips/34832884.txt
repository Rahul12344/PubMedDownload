Andrographispaniculata (Burm.f.) Nees has been used as a traditional medicine in 
Asian countries, especially China, India, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This 
herbaceous plant extract contains active compounds with multiple biological
activities against various diseases, including the flu, colds, fever, diabetes,
hypertension, and cancer. Several isolated compounds from A. paniculata, such as 
andrographolide and its analogs, have attracted much interest for their potential
treatment against several virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms 
of action in inhibiting viral infections can be categorized into several types,
including regulating the viral entry stage, gene replication, and the formation
of mature functional proteins. The efficacy of andrographolide as an antiviral
candidate was further investigated since the phytoconstituents of A. paniculata
exhibit various physicochemical characteristics, including low solubility and low
bioavailability. A discussion on the delivery systems of these active compounds
could accelerate their development for commercial applications as antiviral
drugs. This study critically reviewed the current antiviral development based on 
andrographolide and its derivative compounds, especially on their mechanism of
action as antiviral drugs and drug delivery systems.
