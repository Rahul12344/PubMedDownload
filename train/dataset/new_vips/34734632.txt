Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; Family Togaviridae), is an endemic
pathogen first isolated in 1933 with distribution primarily in the eastern US and
Canada. The virus has caused periodic outbreaks in both humans and equines along 
the eastern seaboard and through the southern coastal states. While the outbreaks
caused by EEEV have been sporadic and varied geographically since the discovery
of the virus, it has continued to expand its range moving into the Midwest states
as well. Additionally, one of the largest outbreaks was recorded in 2019
prompting concerns that outbreaks were becoming larger and more frequent. Because
the virus can cause serious disease and because it is transmissible by both
mosquitoes and aerosol, there has been renewed interest in identifying potential 
options for vaccines. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines and control
relies completely on the use of personal protective measures and integrated
vector control which have limited effectiveness for the EEEV vectors. Several
vaccine candidates are currently being developed; this review will describe the
multiple options under consideration for future development and assess their
relative advantages and disadvantages.
