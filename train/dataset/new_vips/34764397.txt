Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a major viral disease in cats, causing leukemia
and lymphoma. The molecular detection of FeLV RNA and the DNA provirus are
important for staging of the disease. However, the rapid immunochromatographic
assay commonly used for antigen detection can only detect viremia at the
progressive stage. In this study, nested recombinase polymerase amplification
(nRPA) was developed for exogenous FeLV DNA provirus detection, and reverse
transcriptase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) was developed for the detection
of FeLV RNA. The approaches were validated using 108 cats with clinicopathologic 
abnormalities due to FeLV infection, and from 14 healthy cats in a vaccination
plan. The nRPA and RT-RPA assays could rapidly amplify the FeLV template, and
produced high sensitivity and specificity. The FeLV detection rate in regression 
cats by nRPA was increased up to 45.8% compared to the rapid
immunochromatographic assay. Hence, FeLV diagnosis using nRPA and RT-RPA are
rapid and easily established in low resource settings, benefiting FeLV prognosis,
prevention, and control of both horizontal and vertical transmission.
