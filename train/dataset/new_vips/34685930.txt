Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV), Polerovirus, Luteoviridae, is one of the
main viruses that infect sugarcane worldwide. The virus is transmitted by the
aphid Melanaphis sacchari in a persistent, circulative manner. To better
understand the interactions between ScYLV, sugarcane genotypes and M. sacchari,
we explored the effect of sugarcane cultivars on the feeding behavior and
biological performance of the vector. The number of nymphs, adults, winged, total
number of aphids and dead aphids was assayed, and an electrical penetration graph
(EPG) was used to monitor the stylet activities. Multivariate analysis showed
changes in the vector's behavior and biology on cultivars, identifying specific
groups of resistance. In the cultivar 7569, only 5.5% of the insects were able to
stay longer on sustained phloem ingestion, while in the other seven cultivars
these values varied from 20% to 60%. M. sacchari showed low phloem activities in 
cultivars 7569 and Bio266. Overall, cultivar 7569 showed the worst biological
performance of aphids, with the insects presenting mechanical difficulties for
feeding and a shorter duration of the phloem period, and thus being considered
the most resistant. We conclude that ScYLV virus infection in different sugarcane
cultivars induced specific changes in the host plant, modifying the behavior of
its main vector, which may favor or impair virus transmission.
