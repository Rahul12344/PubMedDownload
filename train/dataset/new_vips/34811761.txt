Young age, female sex, absence of comorbidities, and prior infection or
vaccination are known epidemiological barriers for contracting the new infection 
and/or increased disease severity. Demographic trends from the recent coronavirus
disease 2019 waves, which are believed to be driven by newer severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, indicate that the
aforementioned epidemiological barriers are being breached and a larger number of
younger and healthy individuals are developing severe disease. The new SARS-CoV-2
variants have key mutations that can induce significant changes in the virus-host
interactions. Recent studies report that, some of these mutations, singly or in a
group, enhance key mechanisms, such as binding of the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) of the viral spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptor in the host-cells, increase the glycosylation of spike protein at the
antigenic sites, and enhance the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein, thus 
leading to improved host-cell entry and the replication of the virus. The
putative changes in the virus-host interactions imparted by the mutations in the 
RBD sequence can potentially be the reason behind the breach of the observed
epidemiological barriers. Susceptibility for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and
the disease outcomes are known to be influenced by host-cell expressions of ACE2 
and other proteases. The new variants can act more efficiently, and even with the
lesser availability of the viral entry-receptor and the associated proteases, can
have more efficient host-cell entry and greater replication resulting in high
viral loads and prolonged viral shedding, widespread tissue-injury, and severe
inflammation leading to increased transmissibility and lethality. Furthermore,
the accumulating evidence shows that multiple new variants have reduced
neutralization by both, natural and vaccine-acquired antibodies, indicating that 
repeated and vaccine breakthrough infections may arise as serious health concerns
in the ongoing pandemic.
