Seismic ambient noise with frequencies > 1 Hz includes noise related to human
activities. A reduction in seismic noise during the COVID-19 pandemic has been
observed worldwide, as restrictions were imposed to control outbreaks of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, we studied the effect of changes in
anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 on the seismic noise levels in the Tokyo
metropolitan area, Japan, considering time of day, day of the week, and seasonal 
changes. The results showed the largest reduction in noise levels during the
first state of emergency under most conditions. After the first state of
emergency was lifted, the daytime noise reverted to previous levels immediately
on weekdays and gradually on Sundays. This was likely because economic activities
instantly resumed, while non-essential outings on Sundays were still mostly
avoided. Furthermore, the daytime noise level on Sundays was strongly reduced
regardless of changes on weekdays after the second state of emergency, which
restricted activities mainly at night. Sunday noise levels gradually increased
from the middle of the second state of emergency, suggesting a gradual reduction 
in public concern about COVID-19 following a decrease in the number of
infections. Our findings demonstrate that seismic noise can be used to monitor
social activities.
