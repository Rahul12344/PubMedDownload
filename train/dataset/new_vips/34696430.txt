Despite the volume of publications dedicated to unraveling the biological
characteristics and clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, available data on
pregnant patients are limited. In the current review of literature, we present an
overview on the developmental course, complications, and adverse effects of
COVID-19 on pregnancy. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in 
PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases up to June 2021. This
article collectively presents what has been so far reported on the identified
critical aspects, namely complications during pregnancy, delivery challenges,
neonatal health care, potential routes of viral transmission, including vertical 
transmission or breastfeeding, along with the risks involved in the vaccination
strategy during pregnancy. Despite the fact that we are still largely navigating 
uncharted territory, the observed publication explosion in the field is
unprecedented. The overwhelming need for data is undoubtable, and this serves as 
the driver for the plethora of publications witnessed. Nonetheless, the quality
of data sourced is variable. In the midst of the frenzy for reporting on
SARS-CoV-2 data, monitoring this informational overload is where we should head
to next, considering that poor quality research may in fact hamper our attempts
to prevail against this unparalleled pandemic outbreak.
