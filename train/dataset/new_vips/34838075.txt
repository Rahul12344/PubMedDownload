INTRODUCTION: To identify the subset of patients with de novo nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) for whom [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
and computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) should be recommended, and to determine 
whether PET/CT is a cost-effective decision for precise M staging in endemic
areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data of 4469 patients diagnosed 
with de novo NPC between January 2014 and December 2019. The detection rate of
distant metastasis was compared between different groups. Univariate and multiple
logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the risk factors for distant
metastasis. The cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic strategies was assessed.
RESULTS: The detection rate of distant metastasis in the whole cohort was 5.46%. 
In multivariate analysis, male sex, T3-4 stage, N2-3 stage, and high plasma
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA (≥ 14,650 copies/mL) were risk factors for distant
metastases. NPC patients with T3-4 stage combined with N2-3 stage, high EBV DNA
combined with male sex, or N2-3 stage combined with high EBV DNA were defined as 
recommended group with relatively higher tendency for metastasis. Distant
metastasis incidence in recommended group and unrecommended group were 10.25% and
1.75%, respectively (P < 0.001). In the recommended group, PET/CT significantly
improved the detection rate of distant metastasis (13.25% vs 9.02%, P = 0.005).
Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that additional cost for every one percent
increase in distant metastasis detection rate was $22,785.58 in the recommended
group (< Willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $32,700.00) and $310,912.90 in the
unrecommended group.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with de novo NPC, the tendency for metastasis can be
predicted based on clinical parameters. 18F-FDG PET/CT should be selectively
recommended for the subset of patients with a relatively higher tendency for
metastasis.
