Diatoms are one of the most prominent oceanic primary producers and are now
recognized to be distributed throughout the world. They maintain their population
despite predators, infections, and unfavourable environmental conditions. One of 
the smallest diatoms, Chaetoceros tenuissimus, can coexist with infectious
viruses during blooms. To further understand this relationship, we sequenced the 
C. tenuissimus strain NIES-3715 genome. A gene fragment of a
replication-associated gene from the infectious ssDNA virus (designated
endogenous virus-like fragment, EVLF) was found to be integrated into each 41 Mb 
of haploid assembly. In addition, the EVLF was transcriptionally active and
conserved in nine other C. tenuissimus strains from different geographical areas,
although the primary structures of their proteins varied. The phylogenetic tree
further suggested that the EVLF was acquired by the ancestor of C. tenuissimus.
Additionally, retrotransposon genes possessing a reverse transcriptase function
were more abundant in C. tenuissimus than in Thalassiosira pseudonana and
Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Moreover, a target site duplication, a hallmark for
long interspersed nuclear element retrotransposons, flanked the EVLF. Therefore, 
the EVLF was likely integrated by a retrotransposon during viral infection. The
present study provides further insights into the diatom-virus evolutionary
relationship.
