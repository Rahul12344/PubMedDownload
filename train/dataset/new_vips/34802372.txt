Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many have seriously worried that the plus
burden of seasonal influenza that might create a destructive scenario, resulting 
in overwhelmed healthcare capacities and onwards loss of life. Many efforts to
develop a safe and efficacious vaccine to prevent infection by coronavirus and
influenza, highlight the importance of vaccination to combat infectious
pathogens. While vaccines are traditionally given as injections into the muscle, 
microneedle (MN) patches designed to precisely deliver cargos into the cutaneous 
microenvironment, rich in immune cells, provide a noninvasive and self-applicable
vaccination approach, reducing overall costs and improving access to vaccines in 
places with limited supply. The current review aimed to highlight advances in
research on the development of MNs-mediated cutaneous vaccine delivery.
Concluding remarks and challenges on MNs-based skin immunization are also
provided to contribute to the rational development of safe and effective
MN-delivered vaccines against these emerging infectious diseases.
