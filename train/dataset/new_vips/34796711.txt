Two novel poty-like viruses identified from the transcriptome data of purple
witchweed (Striga hermonthica).

Potyvirids (the family Potyviridae) are the largest family of plant RNA viruses. 
Two novel potyvirid viruses, Striga-associated poty-like virus 1 (SaPlV1) and
Striga-associated poty-like virus 2 (SaPlV2), were identified from the
transcriptome data of purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica). SaPlV1 was most
closely related to bellflower vein mottle virus (BVMoV), the only member of the
genus Bevemovirus, and then to macluraviruses (the genus Macluravirus). The
SaPlV1 genome encodes a 2462-amino acid (aa) polyprotein that may be cleaved into
nine mature peptides. The cleavage sites of SaPlV1, BVMoV, and macluravirus
polyproteins shared strong sequence similarities. SaPlV2 was most closely related
to celery latent virus, the sole species of the genus Celavirus, which is the
most divergent potyvirid genus. The SaPlV2 polyprotein contained 3329 aa; it may 
be cleaved into at least seven or eight mature peptides. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested that SaPlV1 and SaPlV2 may be novel species of the genera Bevemovirus
and Celavirus, respectively. The genome sequences of SaPlV1 and SaPlV2 are useful
resources for studying the genome evolution of potyvirids. Keywords:
Striga-associated poty-like virus 1; Striga-associated poty-like virus 2;
Potyviridae; Bevemovirus; Celavirus; purple witchweed, Striga hermonthica.
