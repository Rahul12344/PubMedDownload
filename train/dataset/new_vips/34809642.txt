BACKGROUND: Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection of ferrets, dogs, and giant
pandas causes an acute systemic disease involving multiple organ systems,
including the respiratory tract, lymphoid system, and central nervous system. In 
this study, we tested a new candidate CDV vaccine-CDV nanoparticles-based on
hemagglutinin protein.
METHODS: The nanoparticles were generated from conformation-stabilized CDV
hemagglutinin tetramers. Immune responses against CDV were evaluated in mice.
Immunization was initiated 6 weeks after birth and boosted two times with 4-week 
intervals. The blood and mucosal samples were collected 2 weeks after each
immunization.
RESULTS: Vaccination with CDV nanoparticles elicited high levels of IgG antibody 
titers in mice (approximately sevenfold to eightfold higher than that obtained
with soluble CDV H protein) and mucosal immune responses and developed increased 
CDV-specific neutralizing antibody. The mice that received nanoparticles showed
significantly higher IFN-γ- and IL-4-secreting cell population in the spleen and 
lymph node compared with mice immunized with soluble H protein. The
co-stimulatory molecular expression of CD80 and CD86 on the surface of DCs was
also upregulated.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that self-assembly into nanoparticles can
increase the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens, and nanoparticles assembled from
conformation-stabilized CDV H protein can serve as a new CDV vaccine.
