Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are used for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment.
However, treatment failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development
following treatment was reported. In this study, we assessed the role of serum
vitamin D, interleukin 13 (IL-13), and microRNA-135a in the prediction of
treatment failure with DAA and HCC development among Egyptian HCV-infected
patients. A total of 950 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease
underwent DAA treatment. Before DAAs, serum vitamin D and IL-13 were determined
by ELISA, and gene expression of miRNA-135a was assessed in serum by real-time
PCR. The predictive abilities of these markers were determined using the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Sustained virological response (SVR) was
achieved in 92.6% of HCV-infected patients (responders). High viral load, IL-13, 
miRNA-135a, and low vitamin D levels were associated with treatment failure and
HCC development. HCC development was recorded in non-responders, but not in the
responders (35.7% vs. 0% p < 0.001). In conclusion: serum IL-13, Vitamin D, and
miRNA-135a could be potential biomarkers in monitoring DAA treatment and HCC
prediction. DAAs-induced SVR may decrease the incidence of HCC.
