B.1.1.7 is a recently discovered variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with increased transmissibility. Recent
findings indicate that this variant has a propensity to infect adolescents and
children at higher rates than adults. The virus gains entry into various body
cells utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and basigin (CD147) as
receptors. The virus mainly affects type II pneumocytes of lungs, endothelial
cells, enterocytes, and renal tubular cells. It is reported to affect testes,
causing testicular pain, and producing histopathological changes, as observed in 
some autopsies. The B.1.1.7 variant can also affect various cells in the testes. 
This raises a major concern regarding the long-term effects of the viral
infection on spermatogenesis and highlights the pressing need for a robust
database of serum samples from infected male children.
