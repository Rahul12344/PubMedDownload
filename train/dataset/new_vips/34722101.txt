In the study, we established a hydrolysis probe-based real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) assay to rapidly detect Canine circovirus (CanineCV) DNA in faecal
samples. We designed a pair of specific primers and one probe targeting Rep in
CanineCV, and sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability tests were performed to
evaluate the efficacy of the assay. The assay showed high sensitivity and a
minimum detection limit of 8.42 × 101 copies/μL, which is 1000-fold more
sensitive compared to traditional PCR. The method was also highly specific,
without cross-reaction with other common canine viruses. Moreover, the assay
showed high repeatability, and the mean intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients 
of variation were 0.26 and 0.36%, respectively. The results of the detection of
clinical samples showed that the positive detection rate of CanineCV was 14.04%
(8/57). Notably, 8% of clinical samples were co-infected with other canine
pathogens. In conclusion, the establishment of a hydrolysis probe-based real-time
PCR method provides a fast, sensitive, specific, reliable, and repeatable method 
for CanineCV detection.Supplementary Information: The online version contains
