Virus epidemics such as Ebola virus, Zika virus, MERS-coronavirus, and others
have wreaked havoc on humanity in the last decade. In addition, a coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and its continuously evolving mutants have become so deadly
that they have forced the entire technical advancement of healthcare into peril. 
Traditional ways of detecting these viruses have been successful to some extent, 
but they are costly, time-consuming, and require specialized human resources.
Terahertz-based biosensors have the potential to lead the way for low-cost,
non-invasive, and rapid virus detection. This review explores the latest
progresses in terahertz technology-based biosensors for the virus, viral
particle, and antigen detection, as well as upcoming research directions in the
field.
