BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of musculoskeletal pain and
disability among Americans. Physical therapy (PT) is recommended per the 2019 ACR
/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for Treatment of OA of the Hand, Hip, and Knee.
During COVID-19, access to healthcare has been altered in a variety of clinical
settings, with the pandemic creating delays in healthcare, with an unknown impact
on access to PT care for OA.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether referrals to PT for OA were reduced in
2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done of 3586 PT referrals placed by the
University of California, Davis for 206 OA ICD-10 codes from January to November 
2019 and from January to November 2020. The numbers of PT referrals per month of 
each year were compared using both descriptive statistics and Poisson Regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1972 PT referrals for OA were placed from January to November
2019. Only 1614 referrals for OA were placed from January to November 2020,
representing a significant decrease (p = 0.001). Month-by-month analysis of 2020 
compared to 2019 revealed statistically significant drops in PT referrals for OA 
in April (p = 0.001), May (p = 0.001), and August (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a significant reduction in the number of
referrals for PT for OA placed in 2020 during the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic. These reductions were particularly evident in the months following
state-mandated actions and closures. Factors associated with this outcome may
include decreased access to primary care providers, perceptions of PT
availability by health care providers, decreased mobility limiting access to both
clinic and PT appointments, and/or willingness to engage in PT by patients during
the pandemic.
