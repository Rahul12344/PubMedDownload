Introduction: Fibrosis is an inevitable complication of chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) radically treated HCV and were
suggested to ameliorate fibrosis. Silymarin (a natural herbal remedy) was
proposed to further decrease hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Consequently,
serial monitoring of liver fibrosis status by different biomarkers is needed.
Aim of the study: To assess hyaluronic acid (HA) as a potential marker of
fibrosis regression after DAAs in chronic HCV patients; in addition, to evaluate 
silymarin as an agent that, beside DAAs, could further improve fibrosis.
Material and methods: Two groups were included (150 patients each). Group 1
received DAAs only, while group 2 received DAAs followed by silymarin. Hyaluronic
acid and FIB4 score were assessed at baseline before treatment and 1 year after
inclusion in the study.
Results: We found that DAA therapy alone or in combination with silymarin
resulted in a significant reduction in serum HA level. However, the latter case
showed a statistically significantly greater reduction (p = 0.034). Mean ±SD of
serum HA level was 211.8 ±179.9 and 143.3 ±123.9 µg/l before and one year after
inclusion respectively in group 1 (p = 0.001) and also, its level decreased
significantly in group 2 from 188.3 ±211.8 µg/l before receiving DAAs to 126.4
±136.9 µg/l at one year after inclusion (p = 0.001). There was no significant
difference between the 2 studied groups as regards FIB-4 at 1 year after
inclusion (p = 0.103).
Conclusions: Hyaluronic acid might be a sensitive marker for monitoring fibrosis 
regression in treated chronic HCV patients. Adding silymarin to treatment
protocols could ameliorate the fibrosis status.
