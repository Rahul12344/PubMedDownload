Women with HIV may experience higher rates of non-AIDS comorbidities compared to 
men with HIV, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We
investigated sex-related differences in the effects of HIV on monocyte phenotypes
within the Ugandan Study of HIV effects on the Myocardium and Atherosclerosis
(mUTIMA). Of 133 participants who provided blood for flow cytometry assays, 86
(65%) were women and 91 (68%) were persons living with HIV (PLWH) on
antiretroviral therapy. The median age was 57 (interquartile range, 52-63) years.
PLWH exhibited a lower proportion of circulating CD14+CD16- classical monocytes
(66.3% vs. 75.1%; p < 0.001), and higher proportion of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory
monocytes (17% vs. 11.7%; p = 0.005) compared to HIV-uninfected participants.
PLWH had an increased expression of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 in total
monocytes (CX3CR1+ monocytes, 24.5% vs. 4.7%; p < 0.001) and monocyte subsets.
These findings were generally similar when analyzed by sex, with no significant
interactions between sex and HIV status in adjusted models. Our data show that
the inflammatory monocyte subset is expanded and monocyte CX3CR1 chemokine
receptor expression is enhanced among PLWH, regardless of sex. Whether these
parameters differentially affect risk for non-AIDS comorbidities and clinical
outcomes in women with HIV requires additional investigation.
