The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. As of
August 2021, more than 200 million people have been infected with the virus and
4.3 million have lost their lives. Various monoclonal antibodies of human origin 
that neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent
patients for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. Several vaccines have been
developed to restrict the spread of the virus and have been rapidly administered.
However, the rollout of vaccines has coincided with the spread of variants of
concern. Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 present new challenges for therapeutic
antibodies and threaten the efficacy of current vaccines. Here, we review the
problems faced by neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in the midst of the
increasing spread of mutant viruses.
