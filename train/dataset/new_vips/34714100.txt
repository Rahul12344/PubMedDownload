The HIV Research for Prevention (HIVR4P) conference catalyzes knowledge sharing
on biomedical HIV prevention interventions such as HIV vaccines, antibody
infusions, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and microbicides in totality-from the
molecular details and delivery formulations to the behavioral, social, and
structural underpinnings. HIVR4P // Virtual was held over the course of 2 weeks
on January 27-28 and February 3-4, 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to
inflict unprecedented harm globally. The HIVR4P community came together with
1,802 researchers, care providers, policymakers, implementers, and advocates from
92 countries whose expertise spanned the breadth of the HIV prevention pipeline
from preclinical to implementation. The program included 113 oral and 266 poster 
presentations. This article presents a brief summary of the conference
highlights. Complete abstracts, webcasts, and daily rapporteur summaries may be
found on the conference website (https://www.hivr4p.org/).
