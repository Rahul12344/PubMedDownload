BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) and homeless people represent now a
large reservoir of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, Hepatis C
elimination programs can barely reach these subgroups of patients. We aimed to
evaluate and compare the retention in care among these difficult-to-treat
patients when managed for HCV in hospital or in an out-of-hospital setting.
METHODS: In our retrospective study, we categorized the included patients (PWID
and homeless persons) into two groups according to whether anti-HCV treatment was
offered and provided in a hospital or an out-of-hospital setting. We run logistic
regressions to evaluate factors associated with retention in care (defined as the
completion of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) therapy).
RESULTS: We included 56 patients in our study: 27 were in the out-of-hospital
group. Overall, 33 patients completed DAAs therapy. A higher rate of retention in
care was observed in the out-of-hospital group rather than in-hospital group (p =
0.001). At the univariate analysis, retention in care was associated with the
out-of-hospital management (p = 0.002) and with a shorter time between the first 
visit and the scheduled start of DAAs (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of treatment models that can better adapt to
difficult-to-treat populations, such as an out-of-hospital approach, will be
important for achieving the eradication of HCV infection.
