BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vitamin D is known to modulate immune response and its
deficiency was associated with respiratory distress in patients hospitalized for 
pneumonia. Nevertheless, numerous reviews on vitamin D in COVID-19 patients have 
shown conflicting results, as previously reported also for other respiratory
diseases (e.g., influenza).
METHODS: This umbrella review aims to assess whether low serum 25-OHD is
associated with susceptibility to COVID 19, their severity, and mortality. A
total of 1559 studies were excluded after the title, abstract and full-text
articles screening and 9 papers were included in this review: 2 systematic
reviews and 7 metanalysis.
RESULTS: The findings of this review that summarized studies from 5 WHO regions
(European Region, Region of the Americas, South-East Asia Region, Eastern
Mediterranean Region, Western Pacific Region) to exclusion only African region,
show that low serum 25-OHD levels are associated with higher infection risks for 
COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the umbrella findings indicate a potential role of vitamin 
D deficiency in COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients and showing an
association between Vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 severity, however,
more robust data from randomized controlled trials are further needed to confirm 
a possible association with the mortality rates.
