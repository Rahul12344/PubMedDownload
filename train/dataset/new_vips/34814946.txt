BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the cause of
coronavirus disease 2019, has become a global pandemic. Currently, there is no
definitive treatment for coronavirus disease 2019. Convalescent plasma therapy
has become a potential specific curative method, while vaccines as protection
modalities require further work.
CASE PRESENTATION: Eight non-intubated Indonesian patients, ages ranging from 40 
to 74 years old, with coronavirus disease 2019 confirmed by viral Ribonucleid
Acid (RNA) real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included. Four patients
were administered two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, and the other four
patients were administered one dose of convalescent plasma with an antibody titer
of 1:320, within the first 14 days since symptoms occurred. The median times from
illness onset to convalescent plasma therapy and from the first day of hospital
admission to convalescent plasma therapy were 13 and 6.5 days, respectively. All 
patients showed improvements in clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, thorax 
imaging, negative conversion of polymerase chain reaction results, and decreased 
oxygen supplementation within 1 week after convalescent plasma therapy. Patients 
with two convalescent plasma doses tended to have faster recovery than those with
one convalescent plasma dose. No severe adverse effects were observed in any
patient.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case series in Indonesia showing that convalescent 
plasma therapy is safe and well tolerated and that early convalescent plasma
therapy before the patient is intubated could potentially prevent disease
progression, increase the recovery rate, and shorten the inpatient time of stay.
