Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membranous particles secreted by
all cell types (including virus infected and uninfected cells) into the
extracellular milieu. EVs carry, protect, and transport a wide array of bioactive
cargoes to recipient/target cells. EVs regulate physiological and
pathophysiological processes in recipient cells and are important in
therapeutics/drug delivery. Despite these great attributes of EVs, an efficient
protocol for EV separation from biofluids is lacking. Numerous techniques have
been adapted for the separation of EVs with size exclusion chromatography
(SEC)-based methods being the most promising. Here, we review the SEC protocols
used for EV separation, and discuss opportunities for significant improvements,
such as the development of novel particle purification liquid chromatography
(PPLC) system capable of tandem purification and characterization of biological
and synthetic particles with near-single vesicle resolution. Finally, we identify
future perspectives and current issues to make PPLC a tool capable of providing a
unified, automated, adaptable, yet simple and affordable particle separation
resource.
