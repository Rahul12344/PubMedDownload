OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of HIV infection with outcomes among
people hospitalized with COVID-19.
DESIGN: Prospectively-planned analysis of the American Heart Association's
COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry.
SETTING: 107 academic and community hospitals in the United States from March
through December 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of 21,528 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at
participating hospitals.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Primary outcome was pre-defined as in-hospital
mortality. We used hierarchical mixed effects models to assess the association of
HIV with in-hospital mortality accounting for patient demographics, comorbidities
and clustering by hospital. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiac
events (MACE), severity of illness, and length of stay (LOS).
RESULTS: The registry included 220 people living with HIV (PLWH). PLWH were
younger and more likely to be male, Non-Hispanic Black, on Medicaid, and active
tobacco users. Of the study population, 36 PLWH (16.4%) died compared with 3,290 
(15.4%) without HIV (Risk ratio 1.06; 95%CI 0.79-1.43; p = 0.71). After
adjustment for age, sex, race, and insurance, HIV was not associated with
in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.13; 95%CI 0.77-1.6; p = 0.54) with no change in
effect after adding body mass index and comorbidities (aOR 1.15; 95%CI 0.78-1.70;
p = 0.48). HIV was not associated with MACE (aOR 0.99; 95%CI 0.69-1.44,
p = 0.91), COVID severity (aOR 0.96; 95%CI 0.62-1.50; p = 0.86), or LOS (aOR
1.03; 95% CI 0.76-1.66; p = 0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study of PLWH hospitalized with COVID-19 in the
United States to date, we did not find significant associations between HIV and
adverse outcomes including in-hospital mortality, MACE, or severity of illness.
