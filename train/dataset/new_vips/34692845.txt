The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a special risk for both
immunosuppressed patients, especially transplant recipients. Although the
knowledge about this infection is growing, many uncertainties remain,
particularly regarding the kidney. Kidney transplant recipients (KDRs) should be 
considered immunocompromised hosts since a potential risk for infection,
comorbidity, and immunosuppression exposure exists. Additionally, the management 
of immunosuppressive agents in KDRs remains challenging. Potential drug
interactions with immunosuppressive treatment escalated the risk of unwanted side
effects. In this review, we aimed to attain an augmented awareness and improved
management immunosuppressant for COVID-19 KDRs.
