In this minireview we describe our work on the improvement of the nucleobase
analogs Favipiravir (T-705) und its non-fluorinated derivative T-1105 as
influenza and SARS-CoV-2 active compounds. Both nucleobases were converted into
nucleotides and then included in our nucleotide prodrugs technologies
cycloSal-monophosphates, DiPPro-nucleoside diphosphates and TriPPPro-nucleoside
triphosphates. Particularly the DiPPro-derivatives of T-1105-RDP proved to be
very active against influenza viruses. T-1105-derivatives in general were found
to be more antivirally active as compared to their T-705 counterpart. This may be
due to the low chemical stability of all ribosylated derivatives of T-705. The
ribosyltriphosphate derivative of T-1105 was studied for the potential to act as 
a inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and was found to be an extremely potent
compound causing lethal mutagenesis. The pronucleotide technologies, the chemical
synthesis, the biophysical properties and the biological effects of the compounds
will be addressed as well.
