Most people recover completely after an acute infection with the novel corona
virus SARS-CoV2. But some people continue to experience symptoms after their
recovery. This phenomenon is called post-acute or long-COVID (from week 4 after
the infection up to week 12) and persistent post-COVID (symptoms for effects that
persist 12 or more weeks after onset). The exact processes that cause long COVID 
remain unknown.Most of those patients suffer from long-term symptoms of lung
damage, including breathlessness, coughing, fatigue and limited ability to
exercise. Today, 18 months after the first infections in Europe we have access to
the first practical guidelines for the long-/post-COVID syndrome. Further on
first prospective studies analysing the incidence of post-COVID are now
available.In this review we will discuss some questions about treatment and
follow up of patients suffering from pulmonary sequelae after their COVID-19
infection, based on the actual literature.
