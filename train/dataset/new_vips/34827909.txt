Hepatitis E caused by hepatitis E viruses of the genotype 3 (HEV-3) is a major
health concern in industrialized countries and due to its zoonotic character
requires a "One Health" approach to unravel routes and sources of transmission.
Knowing the viral diversity present in reservoir hosts, i.e., pigs but also wild 
boars, is an important prerequisite for molecular epidemiology. The aim of this
study was to gain primary information on the diversity of HEV-3 subtypes present 
along the food chain in Switzerland, as well as the diversity within these
subtypes. To this end, samples of domestic pigs from slaughterhouses and carcass 
collection points, as well as from hunted wild boars, were tested for HEV RNA and
antibodies. HEV positive meat products were provided by food testing labs. The
HEV subtypes were determined using Sanger and next generation sequencing. The
genetic analyses confirmed the predominance of a Swiss-specific cluster within
subtype HEV-3h in pigs, meat products, and wild boars. This cluster, which may
result from local virus evolution due to the isolated Swiss pig industry,
supports fast differentiation of domestic and imported infections with HEV.
