The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
caused the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected over 178 million
people worldwide. Even with new vaccines, global herd immunity will not be
reached soon. New cases and viral variants are being reported at an alarming
rate. Effective antiviral treatment is urgently needed. Patients with severe
COVID-19 suffer from life-threatening respiratory failure due to acute
respiratory distress syndrome in their lungs, a leading cause of COVID-19
mortality. This lung hyper-inflammation is induced by virus-caused massive tissue
damage that is associated with uncontrolled cytokine release, known as a cytokine
storm, through JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Here, we review the FDA-approved JAK 
inhibitors that are being clinically evaluated and repurposed for the treatment
of patients with severe COVID-19 by calming SARS-CoV-2 infection.
