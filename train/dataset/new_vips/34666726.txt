BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant variations 
in the level of adoption of public health recommendations across international
jurisdictions and between cultural groups. Such variations have contributed to
the dissimilar levels of risks associated with this world-changing viral
infection and have highlighted the potential role of culture in assigning meaning
and importance to personal protective behaviours. The purpose of this study is to
describe the cultural factors during the COVID-19 pandemic that shaped protective
health behaviours in the Chinese-Canadian community, one of the largest Chinese
diasporas outside of Asia.
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was employed. Content analysis was used
to analyze the data from semi-structured virtual interviews conducted with 83
adult Chinese-Canadian participants residing in a metropolitan area in the
Province of Ontario, Canada.
FINDINGS: The cultural factors of collectivism, information seeking behaviour,
symbolism of masks, and previous experience with severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) emerged as themes driving the early adoption of personal
protective behaviours within the Chinese-Canadian community during the first wave
of COVID-19. These protective behaviours that emerged prior to the first
nation-wide lockdown in Canada included physical distancing, mask use, and
self-quarantine beyond what was required at the time.
CONCLUSION: These findings have implications for the development of future public
health interventions and campaigns targeting personal protective behaviours in
this population and other ethnic minority populations with similar
characteristics.
