BACKGROUND: The epigenetic mechanisms play critical roles in a vast diversity of 
biological processes of plants, including development and response to
environmental challenges. Particularly, DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic
signature that supplements the genetics-based view of complex life phenomena. In 
crop breeding, the decrease in genetic diversity due to artificial selection of
conventional breeding methods has been a long-standing concern. Therefore, the
epigenetic diversity has been proposed as a new resource for future crop
breeding, which will be hereinafter referred to as epibreeding.
DISCUSSION: The induction of methylome changes has been performed in plants by
several methods including chemical drugs treatment and tissue culture.
Target-specific epigenetic engineering has been also attempted by exogenous RNAi 
mediated by virus-induced gene silencing and grafting. Importantly, the new and
innovative techniques including the CRISPR-Cas9 system have recently been adopted
in epigenetic engineering of plant genomes, facilitating the efforts for
epibreeding.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we introduce several examples of natural and induced 
epigenetic changes impacting on agronomic traits and discuss the methods for
generating epigenomic diversity and site-specific epigenetic engineering.
