Newly emerged highly pathogenic A/H7N9 viruses with pandemic potential are
effectively transmitted from birds to humans and require the development of novel
antiviral drugs. For the first time, we studied the in vitro and in vivo
antiviral activity against A/H7N9 of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs), which were
delivered into the cells in the proposed TiO2-based nanocomposites (TiO2∼ODN).
The highest inhibition of A/H7N9 in vitro (∼400-fold) and efficient,
sequence-specific, and dose-dependent protection (up to 100%) of A/H7N9-infected 
mice was revealed when ODN was targeted to the conserved terminal 3'-noncoding
region of viral (-)RNA. After the treatment with ODN, the virus titer values in
the lungs of mice decreased by several orders of magnitude. The TiO2∼ODN
nanocomposite did not show toxicity in mice under the treatment conditions. The
proposed approach for effective inhibition of the A/H7N9 can be tested against
other viruses, for example, new emerging influenza viruses and coronaviruses with
pandemic potential.
