OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the suboptimal health status (SHS) and influencing
factors of nurses in Wuhan Hospital, China during the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) outbreak.
METHODS: This study was conducted through an online survey, from March 1-7, 2020,
in Wuhan, China. The data collection tools, such as Suboptimal Health Status
Questionnaires, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Chinese version of the
Perceived Stress Scale, were used.
RESULTS: The average value of suboptimal health status was 28.44 (standard
deviation=15.15). The overall prevalence of SHS was 35.1%. Suboptimal health
status of the nurses was significantly different based on their gender, age,
whether they directly care for COVID-19 patients, anxiety level, and stress
perception expect education. Multivariate analysis found that average sleep times
per day, female, age, directly participate in the rescue of COVID-19,
self-infection, and anxiety were the influencing factors of suboptimal health
status.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line nurses have poor suboptimal health status in Wuhan.
