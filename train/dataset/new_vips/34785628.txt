Since the start of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has infected almost 200 million human
hosts and is set to encounter and gain entry in many more in the coming months.
As the coronavirus flourish, the evolutionary pressure selects those variants
that can complete the infection cycle faster and reproduce in large numbers
compared to others. This increase in infectivity and transmissibility coupled
with the immune response from high viral load may cause moderate to severe
disease. Whether this leads to enhanced virulence in the prevalent Alpha and
Delta variants is still not clear. This review describes the different types of
SARS-CoV-2 variants that are now prevalent, their emergence, the mutations
responsible for their growth advantages, and how they affect vaccine efficacy and
increase chances of reinfection. Finally, we have also summarized the efforts
made to recognize and predict the mutations, which can cause immune escape and
track their emergence through impactful genomic surveillance.
