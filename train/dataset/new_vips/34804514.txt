Background: Better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks is needed to
support decision-making around mitigation measures for COVID-19 in schools.
Methods: We updated a living systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate
the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. In this update we modified our 
inclusion criteria to include: 1) cohort studies; 2) cross-sectional studies that
investigated and cross-assessed SARS-COV-2 positivity rates in schools and
communities; and 3) pre-post studies. We performed risk of bias evaluation for
all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
Results: 6270 articles were retrieved and six new studies were added in this
update. In total from the two updates and using the new inclusion criteria, we
identified 11 cohort studies (1st update: n = 5; 2nd update: n = 6) and one
cross-sectional study (1st update: n = 1; 2nd update: n = 0). We performed a
meta-analysis on nine of the 11 cohort studies investigating IAR in schools. Nine
cohort studies reported a total of 91 student and 52 staff index cases that
exposed 5698 contacts with 101 secondary infections (overall infection attack
rate (IAR) = 1.45%, 95% CI = 0.31%-3.26%). IARs for students and school staff
were 1.66% (95% CI = 0.08%-4.78%) and 1.18% (95% CI = 0.00%-4.43%) respectively. 
The risk of bias was found to be high for most studies identified, limiting the
confidence in results.
Conclusions: There is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the
extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community
transmission. Emerging evidence suggests the overall IAR and SARS-CoV-2
positivity rate in school settings are low. Higher IAR were found in students,
compared to staff.
Note: This article is a living systematic review that will be updated to reflect 
emerging evidence. This is the second version of the original article published
on 23 December 2020 (J Glob Health 2020;11:021104), and previous versions can be
