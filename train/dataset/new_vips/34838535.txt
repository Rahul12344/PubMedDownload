BACKGROUND: Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a rapid identification of the
virus was essential to quickly recognize positive cases and limit further spread 
by applying appropriate infection prevention. Many diagnostic laboratories use a 
multiplex Real-Time PCR assay, as they are not only highly sensitive but also
specific. Currently, there are several assays and platforms in the market
available which target different SARS-CoV-2 genes. The aim of this study was to
validate and verify the GeneFinderTM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe
InGenius® instrument and compare to the national reference method.
METHODS: GeneFinderTM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit was evaluated against the routine
WHO in- house Real-Time PCR assay, which is also the national reference method in
the Netherlands and used in our laboratory. The sensitivity was tested using the 
analytical panel from Qnostics (Glasgow, United Kingdom) and the specificity was 
tested with patient material comprising of other seasonal respiratory viruses. In
addition, 96 clinical samples initially analyzed by routine Real-Time PCR were
tested using the GeneFinderTM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius®
instrument.
RESULTS: The GeneFinderTM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit had a similar performance
compared to routine in-house testing, with a limit of detection of 500 dC/mL for 
the RdRp-gene and E gene. Meanwhile, the N gene showed a limit of detection of 50
dC/mL. The SARS-CoV-2 test was highly specific and detected no other respiratory 
viruses. The results of the clinical samples were comparable between both assays 
with similar Ct values observed for the in-house Real-Time-PCR and the
GeneFinderTM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit for the N gene.
CONCLUSION: The GeneFinderTM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius®
instrument had an appropriate sensitivity and specificity that could be used in
small scale laboratories or during night shifts where accurate diagnostics are
crucial.
