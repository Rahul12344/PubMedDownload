We report a disease and mortality event involving swans, seals, and a fox at a
wildlife rehabilitation center in the United Kingdom during late 2020. Five swans
had onset of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection while in
captivity. Subsequently, 5 seals and a fox died (or were euthanized) after onset 
of clinical disease. Avian-origin influenza A virus subtype H5N8 was
retrospectively determined as the cause of disease. Infection in the seals
manifested as seizures, and immunohistochemical and molecular testing on
postmortem samples detected a neurologic distribution of viral products. The fox 
died overnight after sudden onset of inappetence, and postmortem tissues revealed
neurologic and respiratory distribution of viral products. Live virus was
isolated from the swans, seals, and the fox, and a single genetic change was
detected as a potential adaptive mutation in the mammalian-derived viral
sequences. No human influenza-like illness was reported in the weeks after the
event.
