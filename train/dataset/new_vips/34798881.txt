BACKGROUND: Events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as physical
distancing, closure of community services, postponement of health appointments,
and loss of employment can lead to social isolation, financial uncertainty, and
interruption of antiretroviral adherence, resulting in additional health-related 
challenges (disability) experienced among adults living with chronic illness such
as HIV. 'Living strategies' is a concept derived from the perspectives of people 
living with HIV, defined as behaviors, attitudes and beliefs adopted by people
living with HIV to help deal with disability associated with HIV and
multi-morbidity. Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV 
and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with 
pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional
web-based survey between June-August 2020. The survey included the HDQ and
questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared
disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t-tests.
We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living
strategies at least 'a few times a week' or 'everyday' during the pandemic.
RESULTS: Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived 
alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the
uncertainty [median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43] and mental-emotional
(25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ 
severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior)
in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the
mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p < 0.001), severity (11.4;
p < 0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p < 0.05) of disability. Most participants 
(> 60%) reported engaging a 'few times a week' or 'everyday' in self-care
strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive
attitudes and beliefs.
CONCLUSIONS: People living with HIV reported high levels of uncertainty and
mental-emotional health challenges during the pandemic. Disability increased
across all HDQ dimensions, with the greatest worsening in the mental-emotional
health domain. Results provide an understanding of disability and self-care
strategy use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
