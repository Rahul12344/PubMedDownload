Racial disparities in health care systems exist in all phases of health care
delivery. The Affordable Care Act has been unable to completely mitigate
disparities in health care as the root cause (ie, socioeconomic inequality)
remains unaddressed. Uninsured status, lack of transportation, high costs, health
literacy, provider unavailability, lack of trust in the health system, and
implicit bias block minority populations from obtaining deserved quality care.
With the COVID-19 crisis, increased sensitivity and development of innovative
approaches to provide accessibly and quality health care are necessary.
