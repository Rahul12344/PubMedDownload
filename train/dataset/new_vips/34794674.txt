Prevention of emerging infections in children is a dynamic arena where
substantial medical advances have enabled intervention and prevention of
infection outbreaks. This article discusses 5 infections causing significant
morbidity and mortality across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Avian influenza
and the Middle East respiratory syndrome are highly contagious zoonoses spread
through aerosol and droplets, affecting predominantly Asia. Dengue infection and 
chikungunya are endemic mosquito-borne viruses in tropical regions across Asia,
Latin America, and Africa. Ebola is a highly contagious virus spread through
human-to-human contact. The latest information in clinical manifestations,
infection, prevention control, chemoprophylaxis, vaccination, and public health
measures is reviewed.
