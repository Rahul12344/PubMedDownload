PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g.,
anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine is the only contraindication to
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination. It is important for
pediatricians to understand the likelihood of an allergic reaction to COVID-19
mRNA vaccines, including its excipients.
RECENT FINDINGS: Episodes concerning for anaphylaxis were immediately reported
following early administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to adults. Although
allergic type symptoms were reported equally in recipients of placebos and test
vaccines in phase 3 clinical trials, post-authorization prospective studies state
that 0.2-2% of vaccine recipients have experienced allergic reactions. Subsequent
allergy testing of affected individuals has focused largely on evaluation of
allergic sensitization to a novel vaccine excipient, polyethylene glycol (PEG).
PEG is a polymer incorporated in numerous pharmaceutical products because of its 
favorable, inert properties. The results of allergy testing in adults to date
indicate that IgE mediated anaphylaxis to PEG allergy is rarely identified after 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine reactions. Numerous individuals with presumed anaphylaxis
have tolerated a second vaccine after evaluation and testing by an allergist,
suggesting either misdiagnosis or a novel immune mechanism.
SUMMARY: Confirmed anaphylactic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are rare,
likely due to a lack of preexisting IgE against the vaccine components, including
PEG.
