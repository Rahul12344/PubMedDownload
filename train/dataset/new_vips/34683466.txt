BACKGROUND: Oncological patients have a higher risk of prolonged SARS-CoV-2
shedding, which, in turn, can lead to evolutionary mutations and emergence of
novel viral variants. The aim of this study was to analyze biological samples of 
a cohort of oncological patients by deep sequencing to detect any significant
viral mutations.
METHODS: High-throughput sequencing was performed on selected samples from a
SARS-CoV-2-positive oncological patient cohort. Analysis of variants and minority
variants was performed using a validated bioinformatics pipeline.
RESULTS: Among 54 oncological patients, we analyzed 12 samples of 6 patients,
either serial nasopharyngeal swab samples or samples from the upper and lower
respiratory tracts, by high-throughput sequencing. We identified amino acid
changes D614G and P4715L as well as mutations at nucleotide positions 241 and
3037 in all samples. There were no other significant mutations, but we observed
intra-host evolution in some minority variants, mainly in the ORF1ab gene. There 
was no significant mutation identified in the spike region and no minority
variants common to several hosts.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no major and rapid evolution of viral strains in this
oncological patient cohort, but there was minority variant evolution, reflecting 
a dynamic pattern of quasi-species replication.
