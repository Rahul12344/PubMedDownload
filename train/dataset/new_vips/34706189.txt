BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results in
hospitalization or death in older patients and those with underlying conditions. 
Sotrovimab is a pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody that was designed to prevent
progression of Covid-19 in high-risk patients early in the course of disease.
METHODS: In this ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly
assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic Covid-19 (≤5 
days after the onset of symptoms) and at least one risk factor for disease
progression to receive a single infusion of sotrovimab at a dose of 500 mg or
placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was hospitalization (for >24 hours) for any
cause or death within 29 days after randomization.
RESULTS: In this prespecified interim analysis, which included an
intention-to-treat population of 583 patients (291 in the sotrovimab group and
292 in the placebo group), 3 patients (1%) in the sotrovimab group, as compared
with 21 patients (7%) in the placebo group, had disease progression leading to
hospitalization or death (relative risk reduction, 85%; 97.24% confidence
interval, 44 to 96; P = 0.002). In the placebo group, 5 patients were admitted to
the intensive care unit, including 1 who died by day 29. Safety was assessed in
868 patients (430 in the sotrovimab group and 438 in the placebo group). Adverse 
events were reported by 17% of the patients in the sotrovimab group and 19% of
those in the placebo group; serious adverse events were less common with
sotrovimab than with placebo (in 2% and 6% of the patients, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, sotrovimab 
reduced the risk of disease progression. No safety signals were identified.
