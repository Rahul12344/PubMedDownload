How do we resolve conflicting ideas about how to protect our health during a
pandemic? Prior knowledge influences our decisions, potentially creating implicit
cognitive conflict with new, correct information. COVID-19 provides a natural
condition for investigating how an individual's health-specific knowledge (e.g., 
understanding mask efficacy) and their personal context (e.g., outbreak
proximity) influence their protective health behavior endorsement, as information
about the virus, its spread, and lethality has changed over time. Using a
dual-process-model framework, we investigated the role cognitive conflict has on 
health decision-making. We used a computer mouse-tracking paradigm alongside
geographical information systems (GIS) as a proxy for context. The results
support a contextualized-deficit-model framework in which relevant knowledge and 
context-based factors help individuals override cognitive conflict to make more
preventative health decisions. Findings from this study may provide evidence for 
a more effective way for experts to combat non-adherence due to conflicting
health information.
