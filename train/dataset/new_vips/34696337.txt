Calf diarrhea is one of the common diseases involved in the process of calf
feeding. In this study, a sample of calf diarrhea that tested positive for bovine
coronavirus and bovine astrovirus was subjected to high-throughput sequencing.
The reassembly revealed the complete genomes of bovine norovirus, bovine
astrovirus, bovine kobuvirus, and the S gene of bovine coronavirus. Phylogenetic 
analysis showed that the ORF2 region of bovine astrovirus had the lowest
similarity with other strains and gathered in the Mamastrovirus unclassified
genogroup, suggesting a new serotype/genotype could appear. Compared with the
most closely related strain, there are six amino acid mutation sites in the S
gene of bovine coronavirus, most of which are located in the S1 subunit region.
The bovine norovirus identified in our study was BNoV-GIII 2, based on the VP1
sequences. The bovine kobuvirus is distributed in the Aichi virus B genus; the P1
gene shows as highly variable, while the 3D gene is highly conserved. These
findings enriched our knowledge of the viruses in the role of calf diarrhea, and 
help to develop an effective strategy for disease prevention and control.
