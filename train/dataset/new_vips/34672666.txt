Point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19 disease based on antigen tests.

Pohanka M.

AIMS: This review is focused on the laboratory diagnoses of the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) by recognizing the antigen of the causative agent
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Various antigen tests are available in this moment and these
tests are being further developed in order to reach a better diagnostic value.
The issue is reviewed in a complex view.
METHODS: In this work, a complex survey of the current literature was made. The
relevant and recent papers related to antigen tests of COVID-19 are discussed and
cited. Basic specifications of the antigen tests and competitive methods were
also scrutinized in the current literature.
RESULTS: The survey of the current literature (years 2019 â€’ 2021) was made and
diagnostic methods like lateral flow tests (lateral flow immunochromatographic
assay) and various types of biosensors were specified as tools for COVID-19
diagnosis and their application to be used as a point-of-care test is considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Small hand-held assays applicable in the point-of-care conditions
for diagnosis of COVID-19 by analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigen are the means of a
growing interest and these means undergo a significant development leading to the
improvements of their specifications and applicability to the current praxis.
Merit of the assays is discussed in this paper (Tab. 3, Fig. 2, Ref. 109).
