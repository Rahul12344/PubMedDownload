Despite many advances on the understanding of dengue pathogenesis in the last
decades, some questions remained to be clarified. The virulence of the pathogen
and the host immune response are the main factors involved in pathogenesis of
dengue infection. In addition, skin dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the primary 
targets for dengue virus infection. After infection, DCs process and present
antigens to T cells and also secrete cytokines that shape the immune response.
Although relevant for the development of antiviral immune response, an imbalance 
in the cytokine production by immune cells could lead to cytokine storm observed 
in severe dengue fever cases. Therefore, this chapter will describe the protocols
for the in vitro differentiation of human monocytes into human monocyte-derived
dendritic cells (mdDCs), followed by dengue virus infection, as well as the
cytokine quantification produced by mdDCs using a cytometric bead array method.
