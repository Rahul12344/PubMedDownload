The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented decline of economic activity at the
globe scale. To slow down the spread of the virus, most governments reacted with 
various measures of social distancing, such as mobility controls, business and
school closures, etc. We investigate the short-term impact of social distancing
measures on the US labour market, using a panel threshold model with high
frequency (weekly) data on unemployment across US states allowing for
heteroscedasticity. Labour is a key input in production, and thus a good proxy
for the state of the economy. We find that changes in the restrictiveness of
mandated social distancing, as measured by the Oxford Stringency Index, exert a
strong impact on unemployment. The bulk of the reaction of unemployment to a
change in the social distancing restrictions does not arise immediately, but with
a delay of 2-4 weeks. In addition, the impact is asymmetric. If the policies
switch to tighter regulations, the increase in unemployment is quicker and higher
in absolute value than a decrease after relaxation. The state of the pandemic,
proxied by the number of new infections and fatalities, constitutes only a
marginal factor.
