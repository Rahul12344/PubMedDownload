Prune dwarf virus (PDV) is a member of ilarviruses that infects stone fruit
species such as cherry, plum and peach, and ornamentally grown trees worldwide.
The virus lacks an RNA silencing suppressor. Infection by PDV either alone, or
its mixed infection with other viruses causes deteriorated fruit marketability
and reduced fruit yields. Here, we report the molecular identification of PDV
from sweet cherry in the prominent fruit growing region of Ontario, Canada known 
as the Niagara fruit belt using next generation sequencing of small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs). We assessed its incidence in an experimental farm and determined
the full genome sequence of this PDV isolate. We further constructed an
infectious cDNA clone. Inoculation of the natural host cherry with this clone
induced a dwarfing phenotype. We also examined its infectivity on several common 
experimental hosts. We found that it was infectious on cucurbits (cucumber and
squash) with clear symptoms and Nicotiana benthamiana without causing noticeable 
symptoms, and it was unable to infect Arabidopsis thaliana. As generating
infectious clones for woody plants is very challenging with limited success, the 
PDV infectious clone developed from this study will be a useful tool to
facilitate molecular studies on PDV and related Prunus-infecting viruses.
