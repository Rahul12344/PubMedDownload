Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disease caused by
mutations inSMN1 gene encoding survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Lack of this 
protein leads to progressive loss of motor neurons and therefore to gradual loss 
of signal transmission between motor neurons and skeletal muscle cells. As a
consequence, patients develop muscle atrophy and lose the ability to move
independently, what is also related to problems with breathing and swallowing.
Here, we describe the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) 
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of adult SMA type 3 patient with a
use of Sendai virus vectors.
