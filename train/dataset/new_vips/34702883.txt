This study investigated pre-COVID-19 admission dependency, discharge assistive
equipment, discharge medical follow-up recommendation, and functional status at
hospital discharge of non-critically ill COVID-19 survivors, stratified by those 
with (N = 155) and without (N = 162) in-hospital rehabilitation. "Mental Status",
intensive-care-unit (ICU) Mobility, and modified Barthel Index scores were
assessed at hospital discharge. Relative to the non-rehabilitation patients,
rehabilitation patients were older, had more comorbidities, worse pre-admission
dependency, were discharged with more assistive equipment and supplemental
oxygen, spent more days in the hospital, and had more hospital-acquired acute
kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, and more follow-up referrals (p < 0.05 
for all). Cardiology, vascular medicine, urology, and endocrinology were amongst 
the top referrals. Functional scores of many non-critically ill COVID-19
survivors were abnormal at discharge (p < 0.05) and were associated with
pre-admission dependency (p < 0.05). Some functional scores were negatively
correlated with age, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney
disease, psychiatric disease, anemia, and neurological disorders (p < 0.05).
In-hospital rehabilitation providing restorative therapies and assisting
discharge planning were challenging in COVID-19 circumstances. Knowledge of the
functional status, discharge assistive equipment, and follow-up medical
recommendations at discharge could enable appropriate and timely post-discharge
care. Follow-up studies of COVID-19 survivors are warranted as many will likely
have significant post-acute COVID-19 sequela.
