Background: COVID-19 has impacted negatively on people physically,
psychologically, spiritually, and socioeconomically worldwide. Nurses' ability to
prepare towards case management is imperative because the potential of one coming
across the virus at the hospital is inevitable. This study intended to explore
and describe nurses' perspectives on preparation towards fighting COVID 19 in
Ghana.
Methods: A qualitative exploratory descriptive design was adopted. Nine major
health facilities designated for COVID-19 treatment centres in four regions in
Ghana were involved in the study. A semi structured interview guide was used to
interview twenty-nine nurses via telephone based on data saturation. Ethics
approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of the Nursing and
Midwifery Council of Ghana.
Result: data yielded two major themes and four subthemes. The two main themes
were 1. Health facilities' preparation of nurses towards COVID-19, with its
subthemes; targeted training, and selection of experienced staff. 2. Nurses'
individual preparedness towards COVID-19 with the subthemes; information sourcing
and sharing. Nurses in Ghana prepared for combating COVID-19 by going through
training on infection prevention and control, and case management using
demonstrations and simulations. Experienced nurses in Ghana volunteered to be at 
the frontline managing cases. Continuous updates on the virus and its management 
through information tracking sharing played a key role.
Conclusion: Nurses in Ghana need to have more specialty training targeted at
diseases of public health importance. Key words: Nurse; preparedness; covid-19.
