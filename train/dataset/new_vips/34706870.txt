This article described our experience in implementing a quality improvement
project to overcome the bed overcapacity problem at a comprehensive cancer centre
in a tertiary care centre. We formed a multidisciplinary team including a
representative from patient and family support (six members), hospice care and
home care services (four members), multidisciplinary team development (four
members) and the national lead. The primary responsibility of the formulated team
was implementing measures to optimise and manage patient flow. We used the
plan-do-study-act cycle to engage all stakeholders from all service layers, test 
some interventions in simplified pilots and develop a more detailed plan and
business case for further implementation and roll-out, which was used as a
problem-solving approach in our project for refining a process or implementing
changes. As a result, we observed a significant reduction in bed capacity from
35% in 2017 to 13.8% in 2018. While the original length of stay (LOS) was 28
days, the average LOS was 19 days in 2017 (including the time before and after
the intervention), 10.8 days in 2018 (after the intervention was implemented),
10.1 days in 2019 and 16 days in 2020. The increase in 2020 parameters was caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic, since many patients did not enrol in our new care
model. Using a systematic care delivery approach by a multidisciplinary team
improves significantly reduced bed occupancy and reduces LOS for palliative care 
patients.
