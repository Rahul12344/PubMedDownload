Stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is a key molecule that binds to cyclic
dinucleotides produced by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase to activate IFN expression 
and autophagy in the fight against microbial infection. The regulation of STING
in the activation of IFN expression has been extensively reported, whereas the
regulation of STING in the initiation of autophagy is still insufficiently
determined. IFN-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are central to the
cell-autonomous immunity in defending a host against viral, bacterial, and
protozoan infections. In this study using the Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia
belangeri chinensis), which is genetically close to primates, we found that
Tupaia GBP1 (tGBP1) combines with Tupaia STING (tSTING), promotes autophagy, and 
moderately inhibits HSV type 1 (HSV-1) infection. The antiviral effects of tGBP1 
are IFN independent. Mechanistically, tGBP1 interacted with tSTING, Tupaia
sequestosome 1, and Tupaia microtubule associated protein 1 L chain 3, forming a 
complex which promotes autophagy in response to HSV-1 infection. This function of
tGBP1 against HSV-1 infection was lost in tSTING knockout cells. Overexpression
of either tSTING or its mutant tSTING-ΔCTT that can only activate autophagy
rescued the anti-HSV-1 activity of tGBP1 in tSTING knockout cells. Our study not 
only elucidated the underlying mechanism of tGBP1 antiviral activity against
HSV-1 infection, but also uncovered the regulation of tSTING in the initiation of
autophagy in response to HSV-1 infection.
