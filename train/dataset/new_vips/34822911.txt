Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is the most destructive etiological agent limiting
banana cultivation areas globally. This study attempted BBTV elimination by
traditional shoot-tip culture (control) and alternative shoot-tip +
electrotherapy (treated) techniques. Shoot-tip culture from Musa acuminata cv.
'Grand Naine' infected sources were exposed to 100 mA electric current for
different time intervals (20-60 min). Virus indexing (via PCR) and genetic
fidelity (by ISSR assay) from the cultures were tested, alongside the
physio-biochemical parameters. Exposure of electric current for less than 50 min 
was ineffective for BBTV elimination. Still, a rise in the duration from 50 min
or more led to eradicating the virus from some explants. Elimination of BBTV was 
complete from 100 % of explants exposed to 100 mA for 60 min, as confirmed by
lack of BBTV detection even at six months after acclimatization. In the control
treatment, the maximum efficiency of BBTV elimination was 28 % after eight
subcultures. On the other hand, improved survival % was observed in the treated
culture. Moreover, homogenous ISSR patterns were there between the treated and
the mother plant and similar physio-biochemical activities were seen in
electro-exposed cultures and healthy ones. Thus, the study reports complete
BBTV-elimination from banana with international compliances, for the first time, 
via electrotherapy while maintaining genomic template and biochemical stability.
