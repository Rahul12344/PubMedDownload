Covid-19 has become one of the most severe diseases causing the acute respiratory
problems that has even killed millions of people worldwide. It was declared as
the ongoing pandemic by the World Health Organization. It is an infectious virus 
which can be transmitted by sneezing, coughing and exhalation of air by any
infected person. There are certain places where there are very high chances of
rooms becoming contaminated like hospital rooms. In this context, we studied the 
transmission of covid-19 particles in an ICU room. In this paper, we have
considered the combined effect of both of air-conditioning (AC) and a ceiling fan
in the room. The infected person can transmit the disease when under influence of
fan and AC, the work highlights the flow of aerosol particles considering the
combined effect as well as the individual effects of fan and AC. The results also
emphasized that the aerosol particles flow have a promising application in
sanitizing the room.
