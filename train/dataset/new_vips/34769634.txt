Stress and lack of quality sleep affect a large portion of the population around 
the globe, and the COVID-19 pandemic has genuinely brought attention to these
problems. This study aimed to investigate whether using a virtual heart-based
meditation program is associated with improved stress levels and quality of sleep
among participants from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
recruited 63 participants to receive an 8-week virtually conducted Heartfulness
meditation program in a prospective pre-post single-arm intervention study from
September 28 to November 22 2020. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were collected at baseline, at 4 weeks, and 8
weeks. Of the 63 participants enrolled in the study, 36 (57%) completed an 8-week
Heartfulness meditation program. There was a significant decrease in PSS (mean
difference of 6.68 with 95% C.I. 4.89-8.47, p < 0.0001) and in PSQI (mean
difference of 2.05 with 95% C.I. 1.03-3.07, p < 0.0001) between week zero and
week eight, regardless of Health Care Professional status. The qualitative
thematic analysis strongly supported the survey results. A significant reduction 
in perceived stress score and improvement in sleep quality index was noted at the
end of a virtual Heartfulness meditation program. Moreover, Heartfulness
meditation practice may help cultivate the quality of empathy, acceptance, and
individual peace. We conclude that the effects of virtually accessible
Heartfulness meditation practice need to be explored further in larger studies.
