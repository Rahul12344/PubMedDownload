PURPOSE: The novel Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact
worldwide that led to changes in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trainee's mental health and
educational preparedness.
METHODS: Trainees at the Indiana University School of Medicine were surveyed
regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their training. Using a Likert
scale, participants were asked questions pertaining to educational preparedness, 
mental health, and clinical work during the pandemic. Data was analyzed using
SPSS version 27. The study was approved as exempt by the Institutional review
Board (IRB).
RESULTS: 324 of the 1204 trainees responded to the survey. The respondents were
76% white with an equal distribution of males and females. A majority of the
respondents were first year residents with an equal distribution of second,
third, and fourth year residents. Twenty-three percent of respondents were in a
procedural residency or fellowship program. Better perceived educational
preparedness was associated with an improved home-work balance during COVID-19
(β = 0.506, p < 0.0001) and having a department that advocated/supported focus on
mental health during COVID-19 (β = 0.177, p < 0.0001). Worse perceived
educational preparedness was associated with being in procedural vs.
non-procedural dominant training program (β = - 0.122, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the training experience of
residents and fellows. Departmental support increased mental well-being and
perceived education preparedness in trainees. Trainees that felt they had a
better home-work life balance had better educational preparedness compared to
their peers. Also, trainees in procedural programs had less educational
preparedness compared to their peers in non-procedural programs. This study
highlights the importance for programs to find avenues to increase educational
preparedness in their trainees while being attuned to the mental health of their 
trainees.
