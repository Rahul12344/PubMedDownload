Background and Objectives: Studies have shown a lower prevalence of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
including amongst those receiving biological therapy. Aims were to determine the 
seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IBD patients and to assess any
association between seropositivity and IBD characteristics. Materials and
Methods: Serum from adult IBD patients was prospectively collected between
December 2020 and January 2021 and analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Information about IBD characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk factors was
collected and analyzed. Serum from non-IBD healthcare workers formed the control 
group. Results: 311 IBD patients on biologics and 75 on mesalazine were enrolled.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) extension (p < 0.001), Crohn's disease (CD) phenotype (p 
= 0.009) and use of concomitant corticosteroids (p < 0.001) were significantly
different between the two IBD groups. Overall seroprevalence among IBD patients
was 10.4%. The control group showed a prevalence of 13.0%, not significantly
different to that of IBD patients (p = 0.145). Only a close contact with
SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and the use of non-FFP2 masks were independently 
associated with a higher likelihood of seropositivity amongst IBD patients.
Conclusion: In IBD patients, the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is not 
determined by their ongoing treatment. Disease-related characteristics are not
associated with a greater risk of antibody seropositivity.
