BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important health threat in
China to which direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are very effective. In 2019,
another novel DAA glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) was officially approved.
Knowledge of its cost-effectiveness would be informative for clinical
decision-making but has not been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of GLE/PIB to inform policy-making on drug reimbursement and
HCV eradication.
METHODS: Markov models were developed from the payers' perspective and simulated 
the lifetime experience of adult patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 
1 or genotype 2. Two regimens, GLE/PIB and pegylated interferon (pegIFN) plus
ribavirin (RBV), were compared in cost and quality adjusted life years (QALY)
with both outcomes being discounted to 2020 values. The incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was computed to reflect the incremental benefit
of GLE/PIB versus pegIFN + RBV. The robustness of the model outcomes was examined
using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to identify
influential parameters and to assess the probability of GLE/PIB being
cost-effective. The GDP per capita in China in 2019 ($10,275) was used as the
threshold for cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: For the entire target population, GLE/PIB was the dominant regimen
attaining a cost-saving of $255 and 1.17 more QALYs relative to pegIFN + RBV. The
finding was more pronounced for HCV genotype 1 infection by saving $1,656 and
creating 1.37 more QALYs. At the $10,275 threshold, the probability of GLE/PIB
being cost-effective was 99.32% overall and 99.85% for HCV genotype 1 infection. 
The age of starting DAA treatment, price of pegIFN + RBV, cost of cirrhosis
treatment and duration of the GLE/PIB regimen were the five most influential
factors. For the patients with HCV genotype 2 infection, the ICER of GLE/PIB was 
$12,914/QALY with 95% confidence interval of $4,047/QALY to $37,640/QALY. The
GLE/PIB regimen statistically cannot be ruled out as a cost-effective option for 
HCV genotype 2 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: GLE/PIB is a cost-effective strategy to treat chronic HCV genotype 1
and HCV genotype 2 infection in China. This regimen should be initiated at a
younger age to maximize its value. To achieve national eradication, it may be
timely to consider replacing pegIFN + RBV with DAAs, such as GLE/PIB, as the
first-line treatment.
