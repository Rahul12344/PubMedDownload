2A is an oligopeptide sequence that mediates a ribosome "skipping" effect and can
mediate a co-translation cleavage of polyproteins. These sequences are widely
distributed from insect to mammalian viruses and could act by accelerating
adaptive capacity. These sequences have been used in many heterologous
co-expression systems because they are versatile tools for cleaving proteins of
biotechnological interest. In this work, we review and update the occurrence of
2A/2A-like sequences in different groups of viruses by screening the sequences
available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.
Interestingly, we reported the occurrence of 2A-like for the first time in 69
sequences. Among these, 62 corresponded to positive single-stranded RNA species, 
six to double stranded RNA viruses, and one to a negative-sense single-stranded
RNA virus. The importance of these sequences for viral evolution and their
potential in biotechnological applications are also discussed.
