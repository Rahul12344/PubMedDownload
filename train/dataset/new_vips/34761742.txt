This review gives a summary of the development of a method to measure lung
surfactant on gastric aspirate at birth in premature infants with the purpose to 
threat respiratory distress syndrome early with targeted surfactant. Machine
learning was used to create the algorithm, and a point-of-care spectrometer was
constructed for use in the delivery room. The sensitivity was 91% and specificity
79% in a clinical trial. The same method was used to measure surfactant in
tracheal fluid in patients with COVID-19 since lung surfactant may be diminished 
in these patients.
