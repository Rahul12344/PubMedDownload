COVID-19 spreads with strong infectivity and triggered a public health crisis,
home and abroad. SARS-CoV-2 has high pathogenic homology with SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, and the three coronaviruses all belong to the Betacoronavirus family.
Due to pregnant women's physical and psychological vulnerability, they are the
susceptible and high-risk groups during the epidemic. This article will review
the reports on adverse effects of maternal and fetal health during the SARS and
MERS and COVID-19 epidemics to provide evidence for the clinical management and
prevention and control of pregnant cases in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
