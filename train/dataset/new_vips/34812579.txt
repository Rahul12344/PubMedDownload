The effects of flock size of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) was
experimentally manipulated to assess the potential of influenza A virus (IAV;
H4N6) transmission from a flocking passerine to bobwhite quail (Colinus
virginianus) through shared food and water resources to mimic starling intrusions
into free-range and backyard poultry operations. Of the three starling flock
sizes tested (n = 30, n = 20, and n = 10), all successfully transmitted the virus
to all or most of the quail in each animal room (6/6, 6/6, and 5/6) by the end of
the experimental period, as determined by seroconversion and/or viral RNA
shedding. Although starlings have been shown to be inconsistent shedders of IAVs 
and when they do replicate and subsequently shed virus they typically do so at
low to moderate levels, this study has provided evidence that relatively small
flocks (i.e., 10 or possibly a smaller number) of this species can collectively
transmit the virus to a highly susceptible gallinaceous bird species. Future work
should assess if starlings can transmit IAVs to additional poultry species
commonly found in backyard or free-range settings. This article is protected by
