Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) is a staple food that is widely
cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa. In August 2018, a survey was conducted in the
main producing regions of Burkina Faso, and leaf samples were analyzed using
virion-associated nucleic acid (VANA)-based metagenomic approach and Illumina
sequencing. A new virus, tentatively named "Pennisetum glaucum marafivirus"
(PGMV), was detected, and its complete nucleotide sequence of 6364 nucleotides
was determined. The sequence contains a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a
polyprotein of 224.2 kDa with five domains (methyltransferase, papain-like
protease, helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and coat proteins), typical of 
marafiviruses. Additionally, a characteristic conserved marafibox domain was
detected in the genome. The nucleotide sequence of the complete PGMV genome
shares 68.5% identity with that of sorghum bicolor marafivirus, and its coat
protein shares 58.5% identity with that of oat blue dwarf virus. Phylogenetic
analysis confirmed that the pearl millet virus is unambiguously grouped with
members of the genus Marafivirus in the family Tymoviridae. This is the first
report on the occurrence of a marafivirus in pearl millet.
