Native Hawaiians (NHs) are among the most vulnerable groups at greater risk for
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the impact of COVID-19 on the 
state's population, a 35-question cross-sectional survey was administered across 
the state of Hawai'i. NH data from the larger report are provided here. The
findings indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting NH 
households in areas of income and housing stability, chronic disease prevalence, 
emotional wellness, and COVID-19 prevention. Short-, medium-, and long-term
recommendations are presented as next steps to addressing the health inequities
among NHs.
