Background: Corona virus is continuing over a year ago throughout the world. To
handle the spread and vitality of the virus, several investigations have been
done and recently the vaccine has launched in order to effect soon. A vaccine has
several controversial issues regarding the effectiveness and potential unwanted
serious adverse effects. In low-and middle-income countries including Ethiopia,
there is a huge knowledge gap and insufficiency of information about the corona
vaccine. Trust is exceptionally crucial to utilize any vaccines apply on human
being. This study aimed to assess trust about corona vaccine and its associated
factors among health professionals working at Dilla University referral hospital,
Southern Ethiopia, 2021.
Method: A hospital-based study employing cross-sectional design and simple random
sampling technique was used to select health professionals who are working at
Dilla University referral hospital from March 1-15, 2021. Trust about corona
vaccine was assessed by a Likert scale type single standard questionnaire. A
Binary Logistic regression at 95% CI, p < 0.05 was used to identify factors
associated with the outcome variable.
Result: This study included 250 health professionals. From the total of
respondents, 155(62%) indicated they would not trust COVID-19 vaccines. The most 
common reasons indicated through a closed series of 10 options for not trusting
the vaccine included doubts in efficacy, novelty of the products, fast-tracking
of the development and general indecisiveness. Men, people aged less than
32 years, who were single, who worked in a coronavirus treatment unit, who had a 
positive coronavirus test and no current history of physical illness were more
likely to trust or demand the vaccine.
Conclusions: The proportion of health professionals that trust COVID-19
vaccination is among the lowest in the world. Therefore, there is a need of
awareness creation training and education about the corona vaccine for health
professionals, particularly for those identified groups.
