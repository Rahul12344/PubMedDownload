BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there is no clinical data pertaining to COVID-19
outcomes and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in Russian patients with
genitourinary (GU) malignancies. Aim of our analysis was to describe the
characteristics of the COVID-19 infection course as well as preliminary safety
and efficacy of Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine in patients with active GU malignancies.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified at nine cancer centers in
different regions. Patients were included if COVID-19 was diagnosed by a
polymerase chain reaction. Data from additional patients with GU cancers who had 
no positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test before vaccination and who received two doses 
of Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) between 11 February and 31 August 2021 were
collected for safety assessment. Anonymized data were collected through an online
registry covering demographics, treatments, and outcomes.
RESULTS: The Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine was well tolerated; no grade 3-5 toxicities
were reported in 112 vaccinated metastatic GU cancer patients. The most common
grade 1 adverse events (81%) were injection site reactions (76%), flu-like
illness (68%), and asthenia (49%). Five patients experienced grade 2 chills
(4.5%) and 3 patients had grade 2 fever (2.7%). With median follow-up of
6.2 months, two COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR test in the vaccine group
(of 112 participants; 1.8%). Eighty-eight patients with COVID-19 disease were
included in the analysis. The average age as of the study enrollment was 66
(range 39-81) and the majority of patients were male with renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). Thirty-six patients (41%) had evidence of metastatic disease, of these 22 
patients were receiving systemic therapy. More than half of patients required
hospitalization. Fifty-four patients (61%) experienced complications. Sixteen
patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia required mechanical ventilator support.
Sixteen patients (18%) died in a median of 23.5 days after the date of COVID-19
diagnosis was established. The 3-month survival rate was 82%. Clinical and/or
radiographic progression of cancer during COVID-19 infection or the subsequent
3 months was observed in 10 patients (11.4%).
CONCLUSION: Patients with GU malignancies are at increased risk of mortality from
COVID-19 infection when compared to the general population. Vaccination could be 
safe in GU cancer patients.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered.
