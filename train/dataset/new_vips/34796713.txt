Identification of the genome sequence of Zostera associated varicosavirus 1, a
novel negative-sense RNA virus, in the common eelgrass (Zostera marina)
transcriptome.

Varicosaviruses (the genus Varicosavirus) are bipartite, negative-sense,
single-stranded RNA viruses that infect plants. We analyzed a transcriptome
dataset isolated from the common eelgrass (Zostera marina) and identified a novel
varicosavirus named Zostera associated varicosavirus 1 (ZaVV1). The ZaVV1 genome 
consists of two genomic segments: RNA1 (6,632-nt) has an open reading frame (ORF)
encoding a large multi-functional polymerase protein (L), while RNA2 (4,304-nt)
has four ORFs: one for a nucleocapsid protein and three for proteins with unknown
functions (P2, P3, and P4). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis using L
proteins showed that ZaVV1 is a novel member of the genus Varicosavirus of the
family Rhabdoviridae. The conserved regulatory elements involved in transcription
termination/polyadenylation and transcription initiation were identified in the
ZaVV1 gene-junction regions with the consensus sequence 3'-UAUUAUUCUUUUUGCUCU-5' 
(in the negative-sense genome). The ZaVV1 genome sequence may be useful for
studying the phylogenetic relationships of varicosaviruses and genome evolution
of rhabdoviruses. Keywords: Zostera associated varicosavirus 1, Varicosavirus,
Rhabdoviridae, common eelgrass, Zostera marina.
