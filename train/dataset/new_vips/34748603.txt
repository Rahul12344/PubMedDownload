COVID-19 patients transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to minks in the Netherlands in April
2020. Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over
into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic
variant known as "Cluster 5" that contained mutations in the spike protein.
However, the functional properties of these "Cluster 5" mutations have not been
well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the 
RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink 
ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even
enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural 
analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to
interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to
less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the
Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine
development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from
humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread
circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize 
human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back
into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of
SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to
prevent future outbreaks.
