Are we repeating the mistakes of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic 
in our approach to combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Is the world's 
emphasis on developing vaccines overshadowing investment in the health systems
that can deliver them? We analyse a report on the politics of investing in health
policy and systems research (HPSR) and conclude by outlining three critical
actions, using the Stuckler-McKee model of social change in health. These are:
exploiting a political window of opportunity; changing the conversation; and
mobilising a campaign to drive the agenda. When implemented together, these
actions could help accelerate investment in health systems to combat the
immediate COVID-19 pandemic and prepare health systems for the next crisis.
