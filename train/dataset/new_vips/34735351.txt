Dynamic Hybrid Model to Forecast the Spread of COVID-19 Using LSTM and Behavioral
Models Under Uncertainty.

Zandavi SM, Rashidi TH, Vafaee F.

To accurately predict the regional spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
infection, this study proposes a novel hybrid model, which combines a long
short-term memory (LSTM) artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic
behavioral models. Several factors and control strategies affect the virus
spread, and the uncertainty arising from confounding variables underlying the
spread of the COVID-19 infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the
effect of multiple factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of
cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries at the time of the
study. The results show that the proposed model closely replicates the test data,
such that not only it provides accurate predictions but it also replicates the
daily behavior of the system under uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the 
LSTM model while accounting for data limitation. The parameters of the hybrid
models are optimized using a genetic algorithm for each country to improve the
prediction power while considering regional properties. Since the proposed model 
can accurately predict the short-term to medium-term daily spreading of the
COVID-19 infection, it is capable of being used for policy assessment, planning, 
and decision making.
