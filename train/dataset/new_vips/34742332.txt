Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects all components of the respiratory
system, including the neuromuscular breathing apparatus, conducting and
respiratory airways, pulmonary vascular endothelium, and pulmonary blood flow. In
contrast to other respiratory viruses, children have less severe symptoms when
infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A
minority of children experience a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome, the
pathology and long-term outcomes of which are poorly understood. The reason for
the lower burden of symptomatic disease in children is not yet clear, but several
pathophysiological characteristics are postulated. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has
brought distinct challenges to the care of children globally. Proper
recommendations have been proposed for a range of non-asthmatic respiratory
disorders in children, including primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis. 
These recommendations involve the continuation of the treatment during this
period and ways to maintain stability. School closures, loss of follow-up visit
attendance, and loss of other protective systems for children are the indirect
outcomes of measures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, COVID-19 has
reshaped the delivery of respiratory care in children, with non-urgent and
elective procedures being postponed, and distancing imperatives have led to rapid
scaling of telemedicine. The pandemic has seen an unprecedented reorientation in 
clinical trial research towards COVID-19 and a disruption in other trials
worldwide, which will have long-lasting effects on medical science. In this
narrative review, we sought to outline the most recent findings on the direct and
indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on pediatric respiratory chronic diseases
other than asthma, by critically revising the most recent literature on the
subject.
