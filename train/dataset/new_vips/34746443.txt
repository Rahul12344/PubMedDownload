Background and Aims: Discriminatory attitude towards people living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major problem in the prevention and
treatment of HIV in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). Understanding the multiple factors
linked to discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in 
SSA is necessary for developing appropriate interventions. This study aimed at
investigating the individual, household, and community-level factors associated
with pregnant married women's discriminatory attitude towards people living with 
HIV/AIDS.
Methods: We used data from the Demographic and Health Surveys of 12 sub-Saharan
African countries conducted between 2015 and 2019. Data on 17 065 pregnant
married women were analyzed. Bivariate (chi-squared test) and multivariable
multilevel logistic regression analyses were applied to investigate the factors
associated with discriminatory attitude towards PLWHA. The results were reported 
as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) at 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results: The mean age of participants was 31.2 ± 8.5. The prevalence of
discriminatory attitude towards PLWHA was 36.2% (95% CI: 33.4%-39.1%).
Individual/household-level factors associated with discriminatory attitude
towards PLWHA were women's educational level (secondary school-aOR = 0.49, 95%
CI: 0.26-0.93), husband's educational level (higher education-aOR = 0.35, 95% CI:
0.16-0.76), decision-making power (yes-aOR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.38-0.69),
wife-beating attitude (disagreement with wife beating-aOR = 0.58, 95% CI:
0.43-0.79), and religion (Muslim-aOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.22-3.04). Community
socioeconomic status (medium-aOR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.93) was the only
community-level factor associated with discriminatory attitude towards PLWHA.
Conclusion: More than one-third of pregnant married women in SSA had
discriminatory attitude towards PLWHA. Women's educational level, husband's
educational level, decision-making power, wife-beating attitude, religion, and
community socio-economic status were associated with discriminatory attitude
towards PLWHA. To lessen the prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards PLWHA,
considering these significant factors is needed. Therefore, governments and other
stakeholders in the respective countries need to increase education coverage.
Moreover, empowering women through education and economy is crucial. Finally,
working with religious leaders to increase awareness about HIV and discriminatory
attitude towards PLWHA should also be a priority in SSA.
