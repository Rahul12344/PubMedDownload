Most endolysins of dsDNA phages are exported by a holin-dependent mechanism,
while in some cases endolysins are exported via a holin-independent mechanism.
However, it is still unclear whether the same endolysins can be exported by both 
holin-dependent and holin-independent mechanisms. This study investigated the
lysis system of OP2-like phage X2 infecting Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae,
causing devastating bacterial leaf blight disease in rice. Based on
bioinformatics and protein biochemistry methods, we show that phage X2 employs
the classic "holin-endolysin" lysis system. The endolysin acts on the cell
envelope and exhibits antibacterial effects in vitro, while the holin facilitates
the release of the protein into the periplasm. We also characterized the role of 
the transmembrane domain (TMD) in the translocation of the endolysin across the
inner membrane. We found that the TMD facilitated the translocation of the
endolysin via the Sec secretion system. The holin increases the efficiency of
protein release, leading to faster and more efficient lysis. Interestingly, in E.
coli, the expression of either holin or endolysin with TMDs resulted in the
formation of long rod shaped cells. We conclude that the TMD of X2-Lys plays a
dual role: One is the transmembrane transport while the other is the inhibition
of cell division, resulting in larger cells and thus in a higher number of
released viruses per cell.
