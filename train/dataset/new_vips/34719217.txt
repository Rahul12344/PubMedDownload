Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory
infectious disease caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). The primary pathogenesis is over-activation of the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate and spread rapidly and no effective treatment
options are yet available. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to induce
anti-inflammatory macrophages, regulatory T cells and dendritic cells. There are 
a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy
approaches for COVID-19. Objective: To summarize the pathogenic mechanism of
SARS-CoV-2, and systematically formulated the immunomodulation of COVID-19 by
MSCs and their exosomes, as well as research progress. Method: Searching PubMed, 
clinicaltrials.gov and Chictr.cn for eligible studies to be published or
registered by May 2021. Main keywords and search strategies were as follows:
((Mesenchymal stem cells) OR (MSCs)) AND (COVID-19). Results: MSCs regulate the
immune system to prevent cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and to promote
endogenous repair by releasing various paracrine factors and exosomes.
Conclusions: MSC therapy is thus a promising candidate for COVID-19.
