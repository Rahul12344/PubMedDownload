BACKGROUND: The city of Manaus, Brazil, has seen two collapses of the health
system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We report anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG
antibody seroconversion rates and associated risk factors in Manaus residents
before the second wave of the epidemic in Brazil.
METHODS: A convenience sample of adult (aged ≥18 years) residents of Manaus was
recruited through online and university website advertising into the DETECTCoV-19
study cohort. The current analysis of seroconversion included a subgroup of
DETECTCoV-19 participants who had at least two serum sample collections separated
by at least 4 weeks between Aug 19 and Oct 2, 2020 (visit 1), and Oct 19 and Nov 
27, 2020 (visit 2). Those who reported (or had no data on) having a COVID-19
diagnosis before visit 1, and who were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
IgG antibodies at visit 1 were excluded. Using an in-house ELISA, the reactivity 
index (RI; calculated as the optical density ratio of the sample to the negative 
control) for serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibodies was measured at
both visits. We calculated the incidence of seroconversion (defined as RI values 
≤1·5 at visit 1 and ≥1·5 at visit 2, and a ratio >2 between the visit 2 and visit
1 RI values) during the study period, as well as incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
through cluster-corrected and adjusted Poisson regression models to analyse
associations between seroconversion and variables related to sociodemographic
characteristics, health access, comorbidities, COVID-19 exposure, protective
behaviours, and symptoms.
FINDINGS: 2496 DETECTCoV-19 cohort participants returned for a follow-up visit
between Oct 19 and Nov 27, 2020, of whom 204 reported having COVID-19 before the 
first visit and 24 had no data regarding previous disease status. 559
participants were seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibodies at
baseline. Of the remaining 1709 participants who were seronegative at baseline,
71 did not meet the criteria for seroconversion and were excluded from the
analyses. Among the remaining 1638 participants who were seronegative at
baseline, 214 showed seroconversion at visit 2. The seroconversion incidence was 
13·06% (95% CI 11·52-14·79) overall and 6·78% (5·61-8·10) for symptomatic
seroconversion, over a median follow-up period of 57 days (IQR 54-61). 48·1% of
seroconversion events were estimated to be asymptomatic. The sample had higher
proportions of affluent and higher-educated people than those reported for the
Manaus city population. In the fully adjusted and corrected model, risk factors
for seroconversion before visit 2 were having a COVID-19 case in the household
(IRR 1·49 [95% CI 1·21-1·83]), not wearing a mask during contact with a person
with COVID-19 (1·25 [1·09-1·45]), relaxation of physical distancing (1·31
[1·05-1·64]), and having flu-like symptoms (1·79 [1·23-2·59]) or a COVID-19
diagnosis (3·57 [2·27-5·63]) between the first and second visits, whereas working
remotely was associated with lower incidence (0·74 [0·56-0·97]).
INTERPRETATION: An intense infection transmission period preceded the second wave
of COVID-19 in Manaus. Several modifiable behaviours increased the risk of
seroconversion, including non-compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions
measures such as not wearing a mask during contact, relaxation of protective
measures, and non-remote working. Increased testing in high-transmission areas is
needed to provide timely information about ongoing transmission and aid
appropriate implementation of transmission mitigation measures.
