Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an infectious zoonotic disease infecting, 
mainly, domestic ruminants and causing significant economic and public health
problems. RVF is a vector-borne disease transmitted by mosquitoes.
Aim: In this work, we tried to seek any RVF virus circulation in Tunisia.
Methods: Thus, we investigated 1,723 sera from different parts of Tunisia,
collected in 2009 and 2013-2015 from sheep, goats, cattle, and dromedaries. All
sera were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques.
Results: Eighty-seven sera were detected positive and 11 doubtful. All of them
were investigated by the virus-neutralization technique (VNT), which confirmed
the positivity of three sera.
Conclusion: This is the first case of RVF seropositive confirmed by the VNT in
Tunisian ruminants. Such a result was expected considering the climate,
entomology, and geographic location of the country. Further investigations must
enhance our findings to understand the RVF epidemiologic situation better and
implement risk-based surveillance programs and effective control strategies.
