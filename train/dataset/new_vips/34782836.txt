The goal of this paper is to develop an optimal statistical model to analyze
COVID-19 data in order to model and analyze the COVID-19 mortality rates in
Somalia. Combining the log-logistic distribution and the tangent function yields 
the flexible extension log-logistic tangent (LLT) distribution, a new
two-parameter distribution. This new distribution has a number of excellent
statistical and mathematical properties, including a simple failure rate
function, reliability function, and cumulative distribution function. Maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to estimate the unknown parameters of the
proposed distribution. A numerical and visual result of the Monte Carlo
simulation is obtained to evaluate the use of the MLE method. In addition, the
LLT model is compared to the well-known two-parameter, three-parameter, and
four-parameter competitors. Gompertz, log-logistic, kappa, exponentiated
log-logistic, Marshall-Olkin log-logistic, Kumaraswamy log-logistic, and beta
log-logistic are among the competing models. Different goodness-of-fit measures
are used to determine whether the LLT distribution is more useful than the
competing models in COVID-19 data of mortality rate analysis.
