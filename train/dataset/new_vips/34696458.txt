The emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 has created challenges for the testing
infrastructure. Although large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has
facilitated hospital and public health responses, access to sequencing facilities
globally is variable and turnaround times can be significant, so there is a
requirement for rapid and cost-effective alternatives. Applying a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach enables 
rapid (<4 h) identification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from nucleic acid extracts,
through the presence or absence of a panel of defined of genomic polymorphisms.
For example, the B.1.1.7 lineage ("UK", "Alpha", or "Kent" variant) is
characterised by 23 mutations compared to the reference strain, and the most
biologically significant of these are found in the S gene. We have developed a
SARS-CoV-2 typing assay focused on five positions in the S gene (HV69/70, N501,
K417, E484 and P681). This configuration can identify a range of variants,
including all the "Variants of Concern" currently designated by national and
international public health bodies. The panel has been evaluated using a range of
clinical isolates and standardised control materials at four UK hospitals and
shows excellent concordance with the known lineage information derived from full 
sequence analysis. The assay has a turnaround time of about three hours for a set
of up to 24 samples and has been utilised to identify emerging variants in a
clinical setting.
