Background: Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in
Canada. The illness causes great morbidity and high societal costs. The objective
of this article is to describe the epidemiology of norovirus in the province of
Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2014.
Methods: To assess activity of norovirus and viral gastroenteritis (VGE) in
Ontario, three datasets were acquired from the provincial government: two
traditional surveillance datasets (outbreak and laboratory) and syndromic
surveillance data (telehealth), all spanning 2009-2014. All outbreaks, laboratory
submissions and telehealth calls were first assessed for total VGE. Norovirus and
norovirus-like illness totals were calculated as a proportion of VGE to estimate 
agent-specific activity levels. Affected institution types, sexes and age groups 
were also analyzed.
Results: Between 2009 and 2014, 41.5% of VGE outbreaks, 63.4% of VGE laboratory
submissions and 36.6% of all acute gastroenteritis-related (not restricted to
viral causes) telehealth calls were attributed to norovirus and norovirus-like
illness in Ontario. The most commonly affected institution type was long-term
care homes and the most commonly affected age groups were younger (younger than
five years) and older (older than 65 years) individuals. Females were slightly
more frequently affected than males.
Conclusion: Norovirus and norovirus-like illnesses were the leading cause of VGE 
in Ontario between 2009 and 2014. They comprised the greatest percentage of VGE
when compared with all other VGE-associated viruses. Additional work is needed to
determine all component costs and necessary public health actions to reduce the
burden of disease.
