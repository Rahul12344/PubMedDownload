Introduction: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) rapidly initiated COVID-19 surveillance by leveraging existing
hospital networks to assess disease burden among hospitalized inpatients and
inform prevention efforts. Materials and Methods: The Surveillance Platform for
Enteric and Respiratory Infectious Organisms at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers 
(SUPERNOVA) is a network of five United States Veterans Affairs Medical Centers
which serves nearly 400,000 Veterans annually and conducts laboratory-based
passive and active monitoring for pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis
and acute respiratory illness among hospitalized Veterans. This paper presents
surveillance methods for adapting the SUPERNOVA surveillance platform to
prospectively evaluate COVID-19 epidemiology during a public health emergency,
including detecting, characterizing, and monitoring patients with and without
COVID-19 beginning in March 2020. To allow for case-control analyses, patients
with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19 acute respiratory illness were
included. Results: SUPERNOVA included 1,235 participants with COVID-19 and 707
participants with other acute respiratory illnesses hospitalized during February 
through December 2020. Most participants were male (93.1%), with a median age of 
70 years, and 45.8% non-Hispanic Black and 32.6% non-Hispanic White. Among those 
with COVID-19, 28.2% were transferred to an intensive care unit, 9.4% received
invasive mechanical ventilation, and 13.9% died. Compared with controls, after
adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, COVID-19 case-patients had
significantly higher risk of mortality, respiratory failure, and invasive
mechanical ventilation, and longer hospital stays. Discussion: Strengths of the
SUPERNOVA platform for COVID-19 surveillance include the ability to collect and
integrate multiple types of data, including clinical and illness outcome
information, and SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results from respiratory and serum
specimens. Analysis of data from this platform also enables formal comparisons of
participants with and without COVID-19. Surveillance data collected during a
public health emergency from this key U.S. population of Veterans will be useful 
for epidemiologic investigations of COVID-19 spectrum of disease, underlying
medical conditions, virus variants, and vaccine effectiveness, according to
public health priorities and needs.
