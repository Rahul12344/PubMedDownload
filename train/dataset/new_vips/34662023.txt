Bacterial keratitis or corneal ulcer is an infection of the corneal tissue caused
by varied bacterial species. It can be an acute, chronic, or transient infectious
process of the cornea with a variable predilection for topographical, anatomical,
or geographical domains of the cornea.[1] It can present as insidious progressive
ulceration or rapidly deteriorating suppurative infection of any part of corneal 
tissue. The cornea can be invaded by various microorganisms like viruses, fungi, 
protozoa, and bacteria, but bacteria are most concerning due to rapidly
progressive vision-threatening keratitis with irreversible visual sequelae.[2]
When anatomical, mechanical and antimicrobial barriers of microbial keratitis are
breached, it invites vision-threatening keratitis. The past few decades have seen
a rapid increase in contact lens users globally, resulting in an increase in
bacterial keratitis proportionately.[3][4]Â  The diagnosis rests on clinical and
microbiological evaluation. With rapid advances in clinical diagnosis, growing
research in molecular laboratory investigation, and targeted antimicrobial
therapy, the visual morbidity has reduced to a decent extent, but it remains a
significant cause of sight-threatening keratitis in underdeveloped and rural
areas globally.[5]
