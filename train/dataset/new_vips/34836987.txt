Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging
bunyavirus that causes novel zoonotic diseases in Asian countries including
China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. In phleboviruses, viral proteins play a
critical role in viral particle formation inside the host cells. Viral
glycoproteins (GPs) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are colocalized in
the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC). The nucleocapsid (N) protein was widely expressed in the cytoplasm, even
in cells coexpressing GP. However, the role of SFTSV N protein remains unclear.
The subcellular localization of SFTSV structural proteins was investigated using 
a confocal microscope. Subsequently, minigenome and immunoprecipitation assays
were carried out. The N protein interacts with viral RNA (vRNA) and further shows
translational activity with RdRp which is L protein and localized in the ERGIC
and Golgi apparatus when co-expressed with GP. On the other hand, mutant N
protein did not interact with vRNA either localized in the ERGIC or Golgi
apparatus. The interaction between the N protein of SFTSV and vRNA is important
for the localization of viral proteins and viral assembly. This study provides
useful insights into the life cycle of SFTSV, which will lead to the detection of
antiviral targets.
