Objectives: Prevalence of influenza virus, creates the need to achieve an
efficient vaccine against it. We examined whether the predicted antigenic
epitopes of HA, NP, and M2 proteins of the influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses
accompanied by chitin and chitosan biopolymers might be relevant to the induction
of effective proper mucosal responses.
Materials and Methods: The construct was prepared using B and T cell predicted
epitopes of HA, NP, and M2 proteins from the influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses by
considering haplotype "d" as a dominant allele in the BALB/c mice. Intranasal
immunization with purified LPS free recombinant protein together with chitin and 
chitosan microparticles as adjuvants was administered at an interval of 2 weeks
in thirty-five BALB/c female mice which were divided into seven groups. Ten days 
after the last immunization, humoral and cellular immune responses were examined.
Results: Elevated systemic IgG2a, IgA, and mucosal IgA revealed a humoral
response to the construct. An increase in the number of IFN-γ-producing cells in 
re-stimulation of splenocytes in the culture medium by poly-tope as well as rise 
in the concentrations of IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α along with the regulatory
response of IL-10, presented the capacity of the designed protein to provoke
significant immune responses. The neutralization test ultimately confirmed the
high efficacy of the protein in inhibiting the virus.
Conclusion: The results support the fact that immunogenic poly-tope protein in
the presence of chitin and chitosan microparticles as mucosal adjuvants is able
to induce humoral and cell-mediated responses in BALB/c mice.
