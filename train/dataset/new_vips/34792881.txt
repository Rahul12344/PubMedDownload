The aim of the study was to study the factorial conditionality of the state of
health and the features of medical activity (MA) of patients with COVID-19 who
were treated on an outpatient basis using telemedicine technologies.MATERIAL AND 
METHODS: The study of lifestyle factors (LS) and MA was conducted by an anonymous
survey of 7,743 patients with COVID-19. The patients' health was assessed based
on the study of the course of the underlying disease and the presence of
concomitant diseases, which were detected in 24.3% of COVID-19 patients according
to the data of copying information from medical records.
RESULTS: It was revealed that the prevalence of tobacco smoking was 33.25 cases
per 100 respondents, 45.4% of respondents were overweight, 75.6% of patients had 
a low level of physical activity, 68.2% and 53.8% of patients had low medical
literacy and MA, respectively. It is established that the greatest impact on the 
health status of the patients interviewed was provided by the bio-social activity
(Smoking) (h = 0.702; m = 0.0063; p = 0.0022), physical activity (h = 0.624; m = 
0.0026; p < 0.001, health behavior (h = 0.527; m = 0.0030; p < 0.001) and health 
literacy (h = 0.532; m = 0.0028; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The studied risk factors affecting the health status of COVID-19
patients, most of which are manageable, should be taken into account when forming
therapeutic and preventive measures.
