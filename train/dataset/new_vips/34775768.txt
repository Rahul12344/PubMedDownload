BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed a significant difference 
in case fatality rate between different regions at the early stage of the
epidemic. In addition to the well-known factors such as age structure, detection 
efficiency, and race, there was also a possibility that medical resource shortage
caused the increase of the case fatality rate in some regions.
METHODS: Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI, and Wan
fang of identified articles were searched through 29 June 2020. Cohort studies
and case series with duration information on COVID-19 patients were included. Two
independent reviewers extracted the data using a standardized data collection
form and assessed the risk of bias. Data were synthesized through description and
analysis methods including a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 109 articles were retrieved. The time interval from onset to 
the first medical visit of COVID-19 patients in China was 3.38±1.55 days
(corresponding intervals in Hubei province, non-Hubei provinces, Wuhan, Hubei
provinces without Wuhan were 4.22±1.13, 3.10±1.57, 4.20±0.97, and 4.34±1.72 days,
respectively). The time interval from onset to the hospitalization of COVID-19
patients in China was 8.35±6.83 days (same corresponding intervals were
12.94±7.43, 4.17±1.45, 14.86±7.12, and 5.36±1.19 days, respectively), and when it
was outside China, this interval was 5.27±1.19 days.
DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, patients with COVID-19
did not receive timely treatment, resulting in a higher case fatality rate in
Hubei province, partly due to the relatively insufficient and unequal medical
resources. This research suggested that additional deaths caused by the
out-of-control epidemic can be avoided if prevention and control work is carried 
out at the early stage of the epidemic.
