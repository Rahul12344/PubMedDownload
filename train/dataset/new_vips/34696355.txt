The generation of knock-out viruses using recombineering of bacmids has greatly
accelerated scrutiny of baculovirus genes for a variety of applications. However,
the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a powerful tool that simplifies sequence-specific
genome editing and effective transcriptional regulation of genes compared to
traditional recombineering and RNAi approaches. Here, the effectiveness of the
CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene disruption and transcriptional repression in the BEVS
was compared. Cell lines constitutively expressing the cas9 or dcas9 gene were
developed, and recombinant baculoviruses delivering the sgRNA were evaluated for 
disruption or repression of a reporter green fluorescent protein gene. Finally,
endogenous AcMNPV genes were targeted for disruption or downregulation to affect 
gene expression and baculovirus replication. This study provides a
proof-of-concept that CRISPR-Cas9 technology may be an effective tool for
efficient scrutiny of baculovirus genes through targeted gene disruption and
transcriptional repression.
