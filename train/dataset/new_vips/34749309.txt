Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of dried blood spots (DBS) for
pathogen detection is a potentially convenient method for infectious disease
diagnosis. This study tested 115 DBS samples paired with whole blood specimens of
children and adolescent from Burkina Faso, Sudan, and Madagascar by qPCR for a
wide range of pathogens, including protozoans, helminths, fungi, bacteria, and
viruses. Plasmodium spp. was consistently detected from DBS but yielded a mean
cycle threshold (Ct) 5.72 ± 1.6 higher than that from whole blood samples. A DBS 
qPCR Ct cutoff of 27 yielded 94.1% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity against the 
whole blood qPCR cutoff of 21 that has been previously suggested for malaria
diagnosis. For other pathogens investigated, DBS testing yielded a sensitivity of
only 8.5% but a specificity of 98.6% compared with whole blood qPCR. In sum,
direct PCR of DBS had reasonable performance for Plasmodium but requires further 
investigation for the other pathogens assessed in this study.
