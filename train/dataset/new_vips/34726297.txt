BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven head/neck squamous cell carcinomas 
(HNSCC) prevalence varies globally. We evaluated HPV DNA and p16INK4a in formalin
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) HNSCC from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.
METHODS: HPV was genotyped by PCR-hybridization. All HPV DNA positive and some
HPV DNA negative cases underwent p16INK4a immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 32.8%, 11.1%, and 17.8% of oropharyngeal (OPC), 
oral cavity (OCC) and laryngeal (LC) cancers, respectively. OPC HPV prevalence
was higher in Colombia (94.7%), and Argentina (42.6%) compared to Brazil (10.6%) 
and Peru (0.0%). HPV-16 was the most detected. Other HPVs were found in LC.
Higher rates of p16INK4a positivity were observed among HPV positive OPC/OCC
cases compared to LC cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a role for HPV-16 in a subset of HNSCC,
corroborate the heterogeneity observed in samples from different countries, and
contribute additional etiological and biomarkers information in tumors of
significant impact worldwide.
