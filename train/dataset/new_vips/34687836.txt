BACKGROUND: The canine morbillivirus, previously known as canine distemper virus 
(CDV), is a pathogen which infects dogs worldwide and causes fatal disease. CDV
has a broad range of hosts and can infect at least six orders and more than 20
mammalian families. Domestic dogs are the main hosts of CDV and play a central
role in the transmission of the virus. However, the prevalence of CDV infection
in China remains unknown since there are only a few studies which systematically 
analysed the prevalence of CDV in domestic dogs in the country. Therefore, we
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the frequency of CDV
positivity and associated risk factors of CDV in Chinese domestic dogs.
METHODS: We systematically searched for studies on the frequency of CDV in
Chinese domestic dogs published in English and Chinese to conduct a meta-analysis
using the random-effects model with a forest plot with a 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: The overall estimated frequency of CDV positivity in Chinese domestic
dogs was 22%. In addition, our data show that sampling season, age, breed, and
immunisation status are associated with CDV infection frequency.
CONCLUSION: In a word, CDV is circulating in domestic dogs in China. Continued
intervention strategies based on risk factors are necessary to reduce the
frequency of CDV infection, especially in endemic regions.
