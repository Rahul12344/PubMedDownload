The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for rapid
mobilization of scientists to probe and explore solutions to this deadly disease.
A limited understanding of the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) relative to other coronavirus strains guides 
a deeper investigation into the virus/receptor interactions. The cutting-edge
studies in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of interactions such as
protein-protein interplays have been reviewed in many modeling and analysis
studies. Highlighting the thermodynamic assessments of biological interactions
and emphasizing the boosted transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 despite its high
similarity in structure and sequence with other coronavirus strains is an
important and highly valuable investigation that can lead scientists to discover 
analytical and fundamental approaches in studying virus's interactions.
Accordingly, we have attempted to describe the crucial factors such as
conformational changes and hydrophobicity particularities that influence on
thermodynamic potentials in the SARS-COV-2 S-protein adsorption process.
Discussing the thermodynamic potentials and the kinetics of the
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in its interaction with the ACE2 receptors of the host cell 
is a fundamental approach that would be extremely valuable in designing candidate
pharmaceutical agents or exploring alternative treatments.
