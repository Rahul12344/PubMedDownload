INTRODUCTION: There are not enough studies showing the degree to which the
SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the semen parameters after coronavirus infection in
comparison to before they were infected. In this study, we aimed to assess the
effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on semen parameters.
METHODS: Patients were screened if they had had semen analysis performed from
October 1, 2019, to December 1, 2020, in the assisted reproduction unit and later
had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
patients' semen parameters were recorded before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection,
along with degrees of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dates of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
durations between the treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the second semen
analysis, time of symptom onset, duration of their symptoms, ages, comorbidities,
and any medications patients were taking.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study. The mean age of the
patients was 31.29±5.95 years. The mean duration from first semen analysis to the
PCR test was 7.74±3.03 months. The mean duration between the PCR test and later
semen analysis was 2.35±1.35 months. The median sperm concentration for the
patients before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection were 24 mil/ml and 13 mil/ml,
respectively (p<0.001). The normal morphology percentage before infection was
3.16±0.92, while it was 2.44±1.04 after infection (p=0.011). In 26 patients, the 
period from the time of infection to the second semen analysis was over 70 days, 
while this period was less than 70 days in the other 15 patients; however, in
both patient groups, a significant decrease was detected in the sperm
concentrations and total sperm count.
CONCLUSIONS: In the semen samples we assessed, we observed a significant decrease
in the mean sperm concentration, total sperm count, and mean percentage of
samples with normal morphology after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
