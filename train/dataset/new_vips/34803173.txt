By December 2020, SARS-CoV-2 caused the deaths of nearly 1.5 million people
worldwide. A common strategy to mitigate spread of the virus is mask wearing.
Considerable data demonstrate that masks can create an effective barrier to the
respiratory droplets that can carry the virus. However, the effectiveness of
consumer masks for this purpose varies, and there are currently no minimum
standards that mask manufacturers must meet. Therefore, a need exists for an
at-home test of mask barrier function. Here, we demonstrate a simple test to
compare the function of selected masks using widely available materials and
resources.
