PURPOSE: To report a case of acute retinal necrosis (ARN) after receiving
COVID-19 vaccination.
METHODS: A case report.
RESULTS: A 78-year-old man complained of blurred vision and floaters in the right
eye 2 days after receiving BNT162b2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine and was referred 
to our hospital with worsening visual acuity after 7 days. He had no systemic
symptoms and no history of systemic diseases. Ophthalmic examination revealed
white-yellowish placoid lesions spreading to the entire circumference of the
retina, and temporal and upper lesions extending to the posterior pole, although 
anterior inflammation and vitreous opacity were mild. Diagnostic and therapeutic 
vitrectomy was performed, and VZV-DNA was detected by comprehensive PCR using a
vitreous fluid sample. The ocular inflammation subsided by systemic
administration of antivirals and corticosteroids. However, total retinal
detachment requiring repeat vitrectomy using silicone oil occurred after the
second vaccination.
CONCLUSION: ARN associated with VZV reactivation may develop after SARS-CoV-2
mRNA vaccination.
