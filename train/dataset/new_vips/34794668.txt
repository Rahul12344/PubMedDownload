The first pediatric AIDS cases were reported in 1982. A decade later, the World
Health Organization estimated there were more than 500,000 pediatric AIDS cases
resulting from mother-to-child transmission, 90% of which were in sub-Saharan
Africa. Although the rate of new infections globally has been cut in half since
the peak of the pandemic, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a public
health threat, and rates of new infections continue to increase in some regions. 
Mother-to-child transmission of HIV has now been virtually eliminated in many
parts of the world but remains an issue in resource-limited countries.
