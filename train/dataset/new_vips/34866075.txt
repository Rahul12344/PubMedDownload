In this study, a total of nine chicken samples obtained from two broiler flocks
in Oita and Tottori prefectures in 2020 were examined for Chicken anemia virus
(CAV) infection. The samples were collected from clinically suspected flocks and 
diseased chickens. The CAV genome was detected in all nine samples tested by
real-time PCR. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons of the full-length 
VP1 gene sequences indicated that all the Japanese CAV strains obtained in this
study formed a similar cluster of genotype III and shared high nucleotide
(99.62-100%) identity. The current Japanese CAV strains were closely related to
Chinese CAV strains but not related to vaccine strains. One positive selection
site of VP1 was detected among the Japanese CAV strains.
