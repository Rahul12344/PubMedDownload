Several effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently in use, but effective
boosters are needed to maintain or increase immunity due to waning responses and 
the emergence of novel variants. Here we report that intranasal vaccinations with
adenovirus 5 and 19a vectored vaccines following a systemic plasmid DNA or mRNA
priming result in systemic and mucosal immunity in mice. In contrast to two
intramuscular applications of an mRNA vaccine, intranasal boosts with adenoviral 
vectors induce high levels of mucosal IgA and lung-resident memory T cells (TRM);
mucosal neutralization of virus variants of concern is also enhanced. The mRNA
prime provokes a comprehensive T cell response consisting of circulating and lung
TRM after the boost, while the plasmid DNA prime induces mostly mucosal T cells. 
Concomitantly, the intranasal boost strategies lead to complete protection
against a SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Our data thus suggest that mucosal
booster immunizations after mRNA priming is a promising approach to establish
mucosal immunity in addition to systemic responses.
