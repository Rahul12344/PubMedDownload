Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, most people will 
develop no or mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of the population will
become severely ill, and some will succumb to death. The clinical severity of
COVID-19 has a close connection to the dysregulation of the patient's immune
functions. We previously developed a simple, nanoparticle-enabled blood test that
can determine the humoral immune status in animals. In this study, we applied
this new test to analyze the immune function in relation to disease severity in
COVID-19 patients. From the testing of 153 COVID-19 patient samples and 142
negative controls, we detected a drastic decrease of humoral immunity in COVID-19
patients who developed moderate to severe symptoms, but not in patients with no
or mild symptoms. The new test may be potentially used to monitor the immunity
change and predict the clinical risk of patients with COVID-19.
