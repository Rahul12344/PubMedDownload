CONTEXT: The New York City (NYC) Test & Trace Corps (Test & Trace), under New
York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H), set out to provide universal access to
COVID-19 testing. Test & Trace partnered with numerous organizations to direct
mobile COVID-19 testing from concept through implementation to reduce
COVID-19-related health inequities.
PROGRAM: Test & Trace employs a community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model 
to deliver testing to the hardest-hit, underserved communities. Community
partners, uniquely knowledgeable of the residents they serve, are engaged as
decision makers and operational partners in mobile COVID-19 testing delivery.
IMPLEMENTATION: Through several mobile testing methods, community partners choose
testing locations and tailor outreach to their community. Test & Trace assumes
logistical responsibility for mobile testing but defers critical programmatic
decisions and community engagement to partners. Integral to the success of this
program is responsive, bidirectional communication.
EVALUATION: During the reporting period of December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021,
Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model provided testing 
to 150351 unique patients and processed 274083 tests in total. The available
outcomes data and qualitative feedback provided by community partners illustrate 
that this intervention, combined with robust governmental investment,
successfully ensured that NYC-identified, low-resource neighborhoods had greater 
access to COVID-19 testing.
DISCUSSION: Making community partners decision makers reduced inequities in
access to testing for communities of color. In addition, the model has served as 
the framework for Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 vaccination
program, operated in concert with NYC's Vaccine Command Center, and is a
foundation for addressing health inequities at scale, including during public
health crises.
