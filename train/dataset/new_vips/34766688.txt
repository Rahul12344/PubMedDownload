BACKGROUND: Telehealth use has increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, hands-on requirements of surgical care may have resulted in slower
implementation. This umbrella review (review of systematic reviews) evaluated the
perceptions, safety and implementation of telehealth services in surgery, and
telehealth usage in Australia between 2020 and 2021.
METHODS: PubMed was searched from 2015 to 2021 for systematic reviews evaluating 
real-time telehealth modalities in surgery. Outcomes of interest were patient and
provider satisfaction, safety, and barriers and facilitators associated with its 
use. Study quality was appraised using the AMSTAR 2 tool. A working group of
surgeons provided insights into the clinical relevance to telehealth in surgical 
practice of the evidence collated.
RESULTS: From 2025 identified studies, 17 were included, which were of low to
moderate risk of bias. Patient and provider satisfaction with telehealth was
high. Time savings, decreased healthcare resource use and lower costs were
reported as key advantages of the service. Inability to perform comprehensive
examinations was noted as the primary barrier. In Australia, peak telehealth
usage coincided with the introduction of temporary telehealth services and
increased lockdown measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients and providers are broadly satisfied with telehealth and its
benefits. Barriers may be overcome via multidisciplinary collaboration.
Telehealth may benefit surgical care long-term if implemented correctly both
during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
