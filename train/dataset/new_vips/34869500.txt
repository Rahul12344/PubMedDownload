Background and aims: Hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure 
(HBV-ACLF) is a complicated syndrome with extremely high short-term mortality.
Whether plasma exchange (PE) improves HBV-ACLF outcomes remains controversial.
Here, PE-based non-bioartificial liver support system (NB-ALSS) effects on
short-term HBV-ACLF patient outcomes were investigated. Materials and methods:
HBV-ACLF patients from Chinese Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure (CATCH-LIFE) cohort
receiving standard medical therapy (SMT) alone or PE-based NB-ALSS in addition to
SMT were allocated to SMT and SMT+PE groups, respectively; propensity score
matching (PSM) was used to eliminate confounding bias. Short-term (28/90-day and 
1-year) survival rates were calculated (Kaplan-Meier). Results: In total, 524
patients with HBV-ACLF were enrolled in this study; 358 received SMT alone (SMT
group), and the remaining 166 received PE-based NB-ALSS in addition to SMT
(SMT+PE group). PSM generated 166 pairs of cases. In the SMT+PE group, 28-day,
90-day, and 1-year survival rates were 11.90, 8.00, and 10.90%, respectively,
higher than those in the SMT group. Subgroup analysis revealed that PE-based
NB-ALSS had the best efficacy in patients with ACLF grade 2 or MELD scores of
30-40 (MELD grade 3). In MELD grade 3 patients who received SMT+PE, 28-day,
90-day, and 1-year survival rates were improved by 18.60, 14.20, and 20.10%,
respectively. According to multivariate Cox regression analysis, PE-based NB-ALSS
was the only independent protective factor for HBV-ACLF patient prognosis at 28
days, 90 days, and 1 year (28 days, HR = 0.516, p = 0.001; 90 days, HR = 0.663, p
= 0.010; 1 year, HR = 0.610, p = 0.051). For those who received SMT+PE therapy,
PE-based NB-ALSS therapy frequency was the only independent protective factor for
short-term prognosis (28-day, HR = 0.597, p = 0.001; 90-day, HR = 0.772, p =
0.018). Conclusions: This multicenter prospective study showed that the addition 
of PE-based NB-ALSS to SMT improves short-term (28/90 days and 1-year) outcomes
in patients with HBV-ACLF, especially in MELD grade 3 patients. Optimization of
PE-based NB-ALSS may improve prognosis or even save lives among HBV-ACLF
patients.
