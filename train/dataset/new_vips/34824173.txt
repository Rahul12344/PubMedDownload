OBJECTIVE: The aim: The aim of this study was to determine the awareness level
regarding pap smear in women living in Baghdad city, Iraq.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was done in 
265 women living in Baghdad city using internet-based survey. Questionnaire was
adopted from a previous study to measure the awareness level among women.
RESULTS: Results: the results showed that only 8(3%) of the respondent had a
family history of cervical cancer. Almost (94%) have heard about cervical cancer,
while only (38%) knew that HPV virus is the cause of cervical cancer. Majority of
the respondents (87%) heard about pap smear while only 67 (25.0 %) had performed 
pap smear before. A total of 86% agreed that early diagnosis is important in
treating of the cervical cancer.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Majority of women heard of cervical cancer and pap
smear, but the level of its practice is still low with only 25% of respondents
had performed it before. More health promotion is needed especially, at the
primary care level regarding the importance of performing regular pap smear
especially for women with family history of the cervical cancer.
