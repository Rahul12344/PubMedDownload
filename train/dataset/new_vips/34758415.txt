BACKGROUND: Following the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid spread throughout the world, new viral
variants of concern (VOC) have emerged. There is a critical need to understand
the impact of the emerging variants on host response and disease dynamics to
facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics.
METHODS: Syrian golden hamsters are the leading small animal model that
recapitulates key aspects of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We
performed intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into hamsters with the ancestral
virus (nCoV-WA1-2020) or VOC first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7,
alpha) and South Africa (B.1.351, beta) and analyzed viral loads and host
responses.
FINDINGS: Similar gross and histopathologic pulmonary lesions were observed after
infection with all three variants. Although differences in viral genomic copy
numbers were noted in the lungs and oral swabs of challenged animals, infectious 
titers in the lungs were comparable between the variants. Antibody neutralization
capacities varied, dependent on the original challenge virus and cross-variant
protective capacity. Transcriptional profiling of lung samples 4 days
post-challenge (DPC) indicated significant induction of antiviral pathways in
response to all three challenges with a more robust inflammatory signature in
response to B.1.1.7 infection. Furthermore, no additional mutations in the spike 
protein were detected at 4 DPC.
INTERPRETATIONS: Although disease severity and viral shedding were not
significantly different, the emerging VOC induced distinct humoral responses and 
transcriptional profiles compared to the ancestral virus. These observations
suggest potential differences in acute early responses or alterations in immune
modulation by VOC.
