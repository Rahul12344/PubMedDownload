OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the correlation between the genotyping of
interleukin-10 (IL-10 polymorphism rs 1800871) and the incidence hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) treated with direct
acting antivirals (DAAs).
METHOD: For 200 patients with HCV infection who completed DAA treatment and
followed up for 1 year, IL-10 polymorphism SNP(-819) rs 1800871 analysis was
conducted via real time polymerase chain reaction. During the follow-up period,
100 patients who developed HCC were selected and compared with 100 patients who
did not develop any complications.
RESULTS: The studied patients were divided into two groups according to the
incidence of complications after completion of DAA treatments. During the
follow-up, 100 patients with HCV infection who developed HCC were selected and
compared with 100 patients with HCV infection who did not develop any
complications (positive control group). For the HCC group (n = 100), the mean age
was 58.1 ± 6.4 years, with 92.7% being male and 7.3% being female; 91% had
cirrhosis, 10% had lymphadenitis, 75% had splenomegaly, and 17% had ascites. In
the positive control group (n = 100), mean age was 46.3 ± 9.4 years, with 68%
being male and 32% being female; 20% had cirrhosis, 12% had splenomegaly, and
4.2% had ascites. The results demonstrated that sofosbuvir (SOF) + daclatasvir + 
ribavirin regimen was the most prevalent drug treatment for patients with HCC
(72%), while SOF + Simeprevir was the most safe treatment for HCV infection among
patients with HCC (2%). CT genotype was the most common genotype in the HCC group
(56%), among different drug regimen (67.8%). T allele was the most prevalent in
HCC group (61%), while the C allele was the least prevalent (39%).
CONCLUSION: IL-10 genotyping may help in selecting the safest and most accurate
drug regimen according to the safest genotype response relationship and follow-up
of genotype resistance.
