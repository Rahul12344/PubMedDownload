Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in males is associated with various cancers,
including cervical cancer in women and penile and bladder cancers in men.
However, there is limited research on the prevalence and prevention of male HPV
infection. Moreover, a rapid test that can prevent the increase in HPV infection 
is needed. In this study, the prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogen (STP)
and HPV infection was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in
random urine samples collected from asymptomatic male sexual partners of women
with sexually transmitted diseases. Among 130 men, 65 (50.0%) had STP and 12
(9.23%) had HPV infection. There was no association between STP and HPV
infection. Among 12 cases of HPV infection, three were HPV-16 single infections, 
six were multiple infections, including HPV-16, and three of other high-risk HPV 
infections. Our results suggest the need for STP testing, including HPV testing, 
in sexual partners of high-risk women with sexually transmitted diseases, even in
men without clinical symptoms (asymptomatic). Further research should be
conducted by diversifying urine samples. We report the most convenient method for
HPV detection, and it is expected to be widely applied to prevent sexually
transmitted diseases in men and women.
