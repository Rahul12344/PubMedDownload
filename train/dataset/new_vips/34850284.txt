Lymph nodes (LNs) are secondary lymphoid organs that function as the first line
of defense against invasive foreign substances. Within the LNs, different types
of immune cells are strategically localized to induce immune responses
efficiently. Such a sophisticated tissue structure is a complex of functionally
specialized niches, constructed by a variety of fibroblastic stromal cells.
Elucidating the characteristics and functions of the niches and stromal cells
will facilitate comprehension of the immune response induced in the LNs. Three
recent studies offered novel insights into specialized stromal cells. In our
discussion of these surprisingly diverse stromal cells, we will integrate
information from these studies to improve knowledge about the structure and
niches of LN.
