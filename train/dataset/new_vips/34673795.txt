AIMS: Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities have a significantly increased
risk for a critical course of COVID-19. As the SARS-CoV2 virus enters cells via
the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor II (ACE2), drugs which interact with
the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) were suspected to influence
disease severity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 1946 consecutive patients with cardiovascular
comorbidities or hypertension enrolled in one of the largest European COVID-19
registries, the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 (LEOSS) registry. Here,
we show that angiotensin II receptor blocker intake is associated with decreased 
mortality in patients with COVID-19 [OR 0.75 (95% CI 0,59-0.96; p = 0.013)]. This
effect was mainly driven by patients, who presented in an early phase of COVID-19
at baseline [OR 0,64 (95% CI 0,43-0,96; p = 0.029)]. Kaplan-Meier analysis
revealed a significantly lower incidence of death in patients on an angiotensin
receptor blocker (ARB) (n = 33/318;10,4%) compared to patients using an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) (n = 60/348;17,2%) or patients who
received neither an ACE-inhibitor nor an ARB at baseline in the uncomplicated
phase (n = 90/466; 19,3%; p<0.034). Patients taking an ARB were significantly
less frequently reaching the mortality predicting threshold for leukocytes
(p<0.001), neutrophils (p = 0.002) and the inflammatory markers CRP (p = 0.021), 
procalcitonin (p = 0.001) and IL-6 (p = 0.049). ACE2 expression levels in human
lung samples were not altered in patients taking RAAS modulators.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest a beneficial effect of ARBs on disease severity in
patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and COVID-19, which is linked to
dampened systemic inflammatory activity.
