Background: A depressed host defense is a major contributor to the oral shedding 
of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1. Here, we present an instance in which
herpes simplex labialis was reactivated following major spinal deformity surgery.
Case Description: A 59-year-old female underwent spinal deformity correction for 
lumbar degenerative scoliosis. On postoperative days 2-3, she presented with
pyrexia (38°C) and tachycardia (94/min); by day 5 she had multiple ulcers around 
her lips and was HSV IgG positive. She had a remote history of herpes simplex I
infection 7 years previously. Once started on oral acyclovir, the lesions
improved, and by day 15 postoperative, her pyrexia and all lesions completely
resolved.
Conclusion: HSV-1 should be suspected in patients with a previous history of HSV 
and postoperative pyrexia. Adequate prophylactic administration of acyclovir
should result in resolution of these outbreaks, in this case, attributed to
overly extensive spinal deformity surgery.
