The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a continuous and robust impact on
world health. The resulting COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating physical,
mental and fiscal impact on the millions of people living with noncommunicable
diseases (NCDs). In addition to older age, people living with CVD, stroke,
obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, and hypertension are at a particularly greater
risk for severe forms of COVID-19 and its consequences. Meta-analysis indicates
that hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and thrombotic complications
have been observed as both the most prevalent and most dangerous co-morbidities
in COVID-19 patients. And despite the nearly incalculable physical, mental,
emotional, and economic toll of this pandemic, forthcoming public health figures 
continue to place cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death across 
the globe in the year 2020. The world simply cannot wait for the next pandemic to
invest in NCDs. Social determinants of health cannot be addressed only through
the healthcare system, but a more holistic multisectoral approach with at its
basis the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is needed to truly address social 
and economic inequalities and build more resilient systems. Yet there is reason
for hope: the 2019 UN Political Declaration on UHC provides a strong framework
for building more resilient health systems, with explicit calls for investment in
NCDs and references to fiscal policies that put such investment firmly within
reach. By further cementing the importance of addressing circulatory health in a 
future Framework Convention on Emergency Preparedness, WHO Member States can take
concrete steps towards a pandemic-free future. As the chief representatives of
the global circulatory health community and patients, the Global Coalition for
Circulatory Health calls for increased support for the healthcare workforce,
global vaccine equity, embracing new models of care and digital health solutions,
as well as fiscal policies on unhealthy commodities to support these investments.
