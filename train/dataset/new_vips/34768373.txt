BACKGROUND: Abnormal aldosterone signaling is a recognized source of
cardiovascular damage. Its influence on cardiomyocyte structure, function, and
hormonal receptors when associated with heart failure is still unreported.
METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients with heart failure (LVEF < 40%) and
normal coronaries and valves underwent left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy
(EMB) for evaluation of myocardial substrate. Biopsy samples were processed for
histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis
of myocardial aldosterone receptor and aquaporin-1 correlated with plasma
aldosterone (AD) and renin activity (PRA). Eight patients with virus-negative
inflammatory cardiomyopathy (ICM) had a control EMB after 6 months of
immunosuppressive therapy and recovery of cardiac function with re-evaluation of 
cardiomyocyte structure and receptor expression.
RESULTS: EMB in addition to the diagnosis of myocarditis (15 cases), dilated
cardiomyopathy CM (6), alcohol CM (2), and diabetic CM (3) showed vacuolar
degeneration and cloudy swelling of cardiomyocytes corresponding at electron
microscopy to ions and water accumulation into cytosol, membrane-bound vesicles, 
nucleus, and other organelles, and was associated with an increased AD, PRA, and 
myocardial expression of aldosterone receptor (2.6 fold) and aquaporin 1 (2.7
fold). In the 8 patients recovered from ICM, cardiomyocyte diameter reduced with 
disappearance of intracellular vacuoles and normalization of cytosol, nucleus,
and cell organelles' electron-density, along with down-regulation of aldosterone 
receptor and aquaporin-1.
CONCLUSION: Human heart failure is associated with overexpression of myocardial
aldosterone receptor and aquaporin-1. These molecular changes are paralleled by
intracellular water overloading and cardiomyocyte swelling and dysfunction.
Cardiac recovery is accompanied by down-regulation of hormonal receptors and
normalization of cell structure and composition.
