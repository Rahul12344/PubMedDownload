Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging flavivirus that has caused large-scale
epidemics. Infection during pregnancy can lead to neurologic developmental
abnormalities in children. There is no approved vaccine or therapy for ZIKV. To
uncover cellular pathways required for ZIKV that can be therapeutically targeted,
we transcriptionally upregulated all known human coding genes with an engineered 
CRISPR-Cas9 activation complex in human fibroblasts deficient in interferon (IFN)
signaling. We identified Ras homolog family member V (RhoV) and WW
domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1) as proviral factors, and
found them to play important roles during early ZIKV infection in A549 cells. We 
then focused on RhoV, a Rho GTPase with atypical terminal sequences and membrane 
association, and validated its proviral effects on ZIKV infection and virion
production in SNB-19 cells. We found that RhoV promotes infection of some
flaviviruses and acts at the step of viral entry. Furthermore, RhoV proviral
effects depend on the complete GTPase cycle. By depleting Rho GTPases and related
proteins, we identified RhoB and Pak1 as additional proviral factors. Taken
together, these results highlight the positive role of RhoV in ZIKV infection and
confirm CRISPR activation as a relevant method to identify novel host-pathogen
interactions.
