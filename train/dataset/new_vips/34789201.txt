BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy is emerging as a significant challenge in many
parts of the world in the fight against the COVID19 pandemic. The continued
infection amongst the unvaccinated can lead to a heightened risk of further virus
mutation, exposing even those vaccinated to new virus strains. Therefore, there
are social benefits in minimising vaccine hesitancy. The objective of this study 
is to assess the level of COVID19 vaccine hesitancy in South Africa, identify the
socio-economic patterns in vaccine hesitancy and highlight insights from the
national survey that can inform the development of a COVID-19 vaccination
acceptance communication campaign.
METHODS: The study uses the nationally representative National Income Dynamics
Study - Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) survey. The analysis combines
univariate and bivariate statistics, as well as multivariate regression models
like binomial/ordinal and multinomial logit.
RESULTS: The study finds that vaccine acceptance is lower than that of
non-pharmaceutical intervention like face-mask use. Only 55% fully accept the
vaccine, while a further 16% are moderately accepting of vaccines. Together,
vaccine acceptance is estimated at 70.8%, and vaccine hesitancy against COVID19
is estimated at 29.2% amongst the adult South African population. The study has
identified the perceived risk of infection with the mediating role of efficacy as
a key predictor of vaccine intention. Higher awareness of COVID19 related
information and higher household income are correlated with lower vaccine
hesitancy. The non-black African population group has significantly high vaccine 
hesitancy compared to black Africans.
CONCLUSIONS: There are other significant differences across socio-economic and
demographic variables in vaccine hesitancy. From a communication perspective, it 
is imperative to continue risk messaging, hand in hand with clearer information
on the efficacy of the vaccines.
