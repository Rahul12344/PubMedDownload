Developing an Innovative Pandemic Treaty to Advance Global Health Security.

Gostin LO, Meier BM, Stocking B.

Recognizing marked limitations of global health law in the COVID-19 pandemic, a
rising number of states are supporting the development of a new pandemic treaty. 
This prospective treaty has the potential to clarify state obligations for
pandemic preparedness and response and strengthen World Health Organization
authorities to promote global health security. Examining the essential scope and 
content of a pandemic treaty, this column analyzes the policymaking processes and
substantive authorities necessary to meet this historic moment.
