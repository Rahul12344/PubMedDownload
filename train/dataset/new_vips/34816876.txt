OBJECTIVE: to identify the factors associated with death due to COVID-19 among
Brazilian postpartum women in the first five months of the pandemic and five
subsequent months, and describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics
of postpartum women who developed the disease.
METHOD: cross-sectional population-based study using a secondary database
available in the Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe
-SIVEP-Gripe (Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System),
Brazilian Ministry of Health. A total of 869 postpartum women were included, and 
the analysis considered the first five months of the pandemic and subsequent five
months. Association between the variables of interest and outcome (death due to
COVID-19/cure) was investigated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: most participants were aged between 20 and 34, of mixed race or
Caucasian, and lived in the urban/peri-urban area. The proportion of deaths was
20.2% in the first period and 11.2% in the second. The likelihood of death
increased in both periods due to the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms: 
dyspnea, respiratory distress, and oxygen saturation below 95%, in addition to
the need for ventilatory support and intensive care.
CONCLUSION: the proportion of deaths among postpartum women was high and
decreased in the second period under study. Respiratory signs and symptoms,
mechanical ventilation, and intensive care were associated with death in both
periods.
