Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with systemic inflammation. A
wide range of adipokines activities suggests they influence pathogenesis and
infection course. The aim was to assess concentrations of chemerin, omentin, and 
vaspin among COVID-19 patients with an emphasis on adipokines relationship with
COVID-19 severity, concomitant metabolic abnormalities and liver dysfunction.
Serum chemerin, omentin and vaspin concentrations were measured in serum
collected from 70 COVID-19 patients at the moment of admission to hospital,
before any treatment was applied and 20 healthy controls. Serum chemerin and
omentin concentrations were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared
to healthy volunteers (271.0 vs. 373.0 ng/ml; p < 0.001 and 482.1 vs.
814.3 ng/ml; p = 0.01, respectively). There were no correlations of analyzed
adipokines with COVID-19 severity based on the presence of pneumonia, dyspnea, or
necessity of Intensive Care Unit hospitalization (ICU). Liver test abnormalities 
did not influence adipokines levels. Elevated GGT activity was associated with
ICU admission, presence of pneumonia and elevated concentrations of CRP, ferritin
and interleukin 6. Chemerin and omentin depletion in COVID-19 patients suggests
that this adipokines deficiency play influential role in disease pathogenesis.
However, there was no relationship between lower adipokines level and frequency
of COVID-19 symptoms as well as disease severity. The only predictive factor
which could predispose to a more severe COVID-19 course, including the presence
of pneumonia and ICU hospitalization, was GGT activity.
