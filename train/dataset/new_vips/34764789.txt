Introduction: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy
diagnosed in children. The factors predisposing to ALL remain mostly unknown.
Natural killer (NK) cells are a component of innate immunity. Their role is to
eliminate cells that were infected with viruses or underwent a neoplastic
transformation. The activity of NK cells is regulated by their activating and
inhibitory receptors, inter alia killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIRs). The available data about a link between the incidence of ALL and KIR
genotype are highly inconclusive, and further research is needed to explain
whether such a relationship truly exists. The aim of this study was to analyze
KIR genotype and haplotype combinations in children treated for ALL.
Material and methods: The study included 49 children diagnosed with ALL at
1.2-19.8 years of age. The control group was composed of 43 healthy subjects aged
between 1.2 and 21.9 years. DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini kits. KIR
genotypes were identified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
sequence-specific primers (SSPs). The analysis also included KIR haplotype
combinations: AA, AB and BB.
Results: Patients with ALL and controls did not differ significantly in the
frequencies of individual KIR genes and haplotypes. However, the overall
frequency of all 6 activating KIR genes in patients with ALL was significantly
higher than in the controls (24.5% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.019).
Conclusions: The findings presented here imply that individual KIR genes do not
play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ALL. Nevertheless, a higher number
of activating KIR genes may constitute a risk factor for this malignancy.
