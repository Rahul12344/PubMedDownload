BACKGROUND: The number of youth living with HIV in the United States (US)
continues to rise, and racial, ethnic, and sexual minority youth including young 
men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) bear a
disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic. Due to social and healthcare system 
factors, many YMSM and YTGW do not seek HIV testing services and are therefore
less likely to be aware that they are infected. Mobile health technology
(mHealth) has the ability to increase uptake of HIV testing among these
populations. Thus, the mLab App-which combines HIV prevention information with a 
mobile phone imaging feature for interpreting at-home HIV test results-was
developed to improve testing rates and linkage to care among Black, Latino, and
other YMSM and YTGW living in New York City and Chicago and their surrounding
areas.
METHODS: This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial among YMSM and
YTGW aged 18-29 years. Participants are randomized to either the mLab App
intervention including HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care,
standard of preventive care only, or HIV home test kits and standard of
preventive care only.
DISCUSSION: mHealth technology used for HIV prevention is capable of delivering
interventions in real-time, which creates an opportunity to remotely reach users 
across the country to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and
treatment outcomes. Specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, mHealth technology
combined with at-home testing may prove to be essential in increasing HIV testing
rates, especially among populations at high-risk or without regular access to HIV
testing.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (
NCT03803683 ) on January 14, 2019.
