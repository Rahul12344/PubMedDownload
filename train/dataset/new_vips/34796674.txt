INTRODUCTION: We describe epidemiology and outcomes of confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection and positive admissions among children <18 years in South Africa, an
upper-middle income setting with high inequality.
METHODS: Laboratory and hospital COVID-19 surveillance data, 28 January - 19
September 2020 was used. Testing rates were calculated as number of tested for
SARS-CoV-2 divided by population at risk; test positivity rates were calculated
as positive tests divided by total number of tests. In-hospital case fatality
ratio (CFR) was calculated based on hospitalized positive admissions with outcome
data who died in-hospital and whose death was judged SARS-CoV-2 related by
attending physician.
FINDINGS: 315 570 children aged <18 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2;
representing 8.9% of all 3 548 738 tests and 1.6% of all children in the country.
Of children tested, 46 137 (14.6%) were positive. Children made up 2.9%
(n = 2007) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive admissions to sentinel hospitals. Among
children, 47 died (2.6% case-fatality). In-hospital deaths were associated with
male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.18 (95% confidence intervals [CI]
1.08-4.40)] vs female; age <1 year [aOR 4.11 (95% CI 1.08-15.54)], age
10-14 years [aOR 4.20 (95% CI1.07-16.44)], age 15-17 years [aOR 4.86 (95%
1.28-18.51)] vs age 1-4 years; admission to a public hospital [aOR 5.07(95%
2.01-12.76)] vs private hospital and ≥1 underlying conditions [aOR 12.09 (95% CI 
4.19-34.89)] vs none.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with underlying conditions were at greater risk of severe
SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. Children > 10 years, those in certain provinces and those
with underlying conditions should be considered for increased testing and
vaccination.
