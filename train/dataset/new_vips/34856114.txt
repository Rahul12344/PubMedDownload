To determine risk factors for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among US healthcare 
personnel (HCP), we conducted a case-control analysis. We collected data about
activities outside the workplace and COVID-19 patient care activities from HCP
with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test
results (cases) and from HCP with negative test results (controls) in healthcare 
facilities in 5 US states. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate
adjusted matched odds ratios and 95% CIs for exposures. Among 345 cases and 622
controls, factors associated with risk were having close contact with persons
with COVID-19 outside the workplace, having close contact with COVID-19 patients 
in the workplace, and assisting COVID-19 patients with activities of daily
living. Protecting HCP from COVID-19 may require interventions that reduce their 
exposures outside the workplace and improve their ability to more safely assist
COVID-19 patients with activities of daily living.
