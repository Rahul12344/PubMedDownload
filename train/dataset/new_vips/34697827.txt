The causative agent of COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 has led to over 4 million deaths
worldwide. Understanding the origin of this coronavirus is important for the
prevention of future outbreaks. The dominant point of view that the virus
transferred to humans either directly from bats or through an intermediate
mammalian host has been challenged by Segreto and Deigin, who claim that the
genome of SARS-CoV-2 has certain features suggestive of its artificial creation. 
Following their response to our commentary, here we continue the discussion of
the proposed arguments for this hypothesis. We show that neither the existence of
a furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2, nor the presence of specific sequences
within the nucleotide insertion encoding that site are evidence for intelligent
design. We also explain why existing genetic data, viral diversity and past human
history suggest that a natural origin of the virus is the most likely scenario.
Genetic evidence suggesting otherwise is yet to be presented.
