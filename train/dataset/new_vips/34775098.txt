Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role as signaling molecules in plant
responses to pathogen infection. It is highly reactive with cellular components
such as DNA, lipids and proteins, thereby leading to serious oxidative damages.
Cysteine residues are sensitive targets of ROS in a post-translational
modification known as sulfenylation. However, during plant-pathogen interaction, 
it is still unclear which specific proteins can be oxidized by ROS and undergo
sulfenic modification to regulate the interaction process. Here, we observed a
biphasic production of ROS in Nicotiana benthamiana after inoculation with
Botrytis cinerea. RT-qPCR results showed that the biphasic increase in ROS
production was closely related to the expression of NbRbohA, NbRbohB and NbRbohC.
Furthermore, a ROS-dependent sulfenome analysis was performed and finally 183
differentially sulfenylated proteins were identified. Their post-translational
sulfenylation modification in response to B. cinerea infection was further
confirmed by western blot and mass spectrometry analysis. Virus-induced gene
silencing of those genes encoding sulfenylated proteins resulted in reduced
resistance to B. cinerea. Taken together, our data demonstrate that B. cinerea
infection induces ROS burst in N. benthamiana, which triggers protein
sulfenylation to ensure the transduction of ROS signals and further function in
plant-pathogen interaction. SIGNIFICANCE: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced
by Botrytis cinerea infection trigger changes in cellular redox status through
protein sulfenylation to be involved in plant-pathogen interaction.
