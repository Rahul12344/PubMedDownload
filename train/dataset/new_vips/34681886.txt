Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is an infectious viral disease that is prevalent
worldwide. Traditional nucleoside analogues, as well as the novel drug targets
against hepatitis B virus (HBV), are associated with certain critical factors
that influence the curative effect, such as biological stability and safety,
effective drug delivery, and controlled release. Nanoparticle drug delivery
systems have significant advantages and have provided a basis for the development
of anti-HBV strategies. In this review, we aim to review the advances in
nanoparticle drug delivery systems for anti-hepatitis B virus therapy by
summarizing the relevant literature. First, we focus on the characteristics of
nanoparticle drug delivery systems for anti-HBV therapy. Second, we discuss the
nanoparticle delivery systems for anti-HBV nucleoside drugs, gene-based drugs,
and vaccines. Lastly, we provide an overview of the prospects for
nanoparticle-based anti-HBV agents.
