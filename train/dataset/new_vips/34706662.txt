BACKGROUND: More than 5 years after the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, Zika
infection remains a major concern in regions with high Aedes infestation. The
objectives of this study were (i) to identify clusters of ZIKV infection and
microcephaly, and/or central nervous system (CNS) alterations associated with
congenital infection during the epidemic peak in 2016 and subsequently, in 2017
and 2018; (ii) to measure the non-spatial correlation between ZIKV infection and 
microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection; and
(iii) to analyse the sociodemographic/economic, health, and environmental
determinants associated with the incidence of ZIKV in a region of high
infestation by Aedes aegypti in the Central-West Region of Brazil.
METHODS: This ecological study analysed 246 municipalities in the state of Goiás 
(6.9 million inhabitants). The data were obtained from the Information System for
Notifiable Diseases (ZIKV cases) and the Public Health Event Registry
(microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection).
Incidence rates and prevalence of ZIKA infection were smoothed by an empirical
Bayesian estimator (LEbayes), producing the local empirical Bayesian rate (LEBR).
In the spatial analysis, ZIKV infection and microcephaly cases were georeferenced
by the municipality of residence for 2016 and grouped for 2017 and 2018. Global
Moran's I and the Hot Spot Analysis tool (Getis-Ord Gi* statistics) were used to 
analyse the spatial autocorrelation and clusters of ZIKV infection and
microcephaly, respectively. A generalised linear model from the Poisson family
was used to assess the association between ecological determinants and the
smoothing incidence rate of ZIKV infection.
RESULTS: A total of 9892 cases of acute ZIKV infection and 121 cases of
microcephaly were confirmed. The mean LEBR of the ZIKV infection in the 246
municipalities was 22.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2016, and 10.3 cases/100,000
inhabitants in 2017 and 2018. The LEBR of the prevalence rate of microcephaly
and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection was 7 cases/10,000
live births in 2016 and 2 cases/10,000 live births during 2017-2018. Hotspots of 
ZIKV infection and microcephaly cases were identified in the capital and
neighbouring municipalities in 2016, with new clusters in the following years. In
a multiple regression Poisson analysis, ZIKV infection was associated with higher
population density, the incidence of dengue, Aedes larvae infestation index, and 
average rainfall. The important determinant of ZIKV infection incidence reduction
was the increase in households attended by endemic disease control agents.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses were able to capture, in a more granular way, aspects
that make it possible to inform public managers of the sentinel areas identified 
in the post-epidemic hotspots.
