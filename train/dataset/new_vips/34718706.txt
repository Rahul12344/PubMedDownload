OBJECTIVE: Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold 
standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but it is necessary to utilize other
tests to determine the burden of the disease and the spread of the outbreak such 
as IgG-, IgM-, and IgA-based antibody detection using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an indirect ELISA assay to quantitatively
measure the amount of COVID-19 IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies present in patient
serum, dried blood, and plasma.
RESULTS: The population cutoff values for positivity were determined by receiver 
operating characteristic curves to be 1.23 U/mL, 23.09 U/mL, and 6.36 U/mL for
IgG, IgM, and IgA, respectively. After albumin subtraction, the specificity
remained >98% and the sensitivity was 95.72%, 83.47%, and 82.60%, respectively,
for IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the combined spike subunit 1 receptor binding
domain and N proteins in serum. Plasma and dried blood spot specimens were also
validated on this assay.
CONCLUSION: This assay may be used for determining the seroprevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 in a population exposed to the virus or in vaccinated individuals.
