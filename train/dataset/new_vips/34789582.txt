Following acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to bacteria, viruses, or protozoa, a
subset of patients develop new onset Rome criteria positive irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS), called postinfection IBS (PI-IBS). The pooled prevalence of
PI-IBS following AGE was 11.5%. PI-IBS is the best natural model that suggests
that a subset of patients with IBS may have an organic basis. Several factors are
associated with a greater risk of development of PI-IBS following AGE including
female sex, younger age, smoking, severity of AGE, abdominal pain, bleeding per
rectum, treatment with antibiotics, anxiety, depression, somatization,
neuroticism, recent adverse life events, hypochondriasis, extroversion, negative 
illness beliefs, history of stress, sleep disturbance, and family history of
functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), currently called disorder of
gut-brain interaction. Most patients with PI-IBS present with either
diarrhea-predominant IBS or the mixed subtype of IBS, and overlap with other
FGIDs, such as functional dyspepsia is common. The drugs used to treat
non-constipation IBS may also be useful in PI-IBS treatment. Since randomized
controlled trials on the efficacy of drugs to treat PI-IBS are rare, more studies
are needed on this issue.
