Pepper mottle virus (PepMoV) is a destructive pathogen that infects various
solanaceous plants, including pepper, bell pepper, potato, and tomato. In this
review, we summarize what is known about the molecular characteristics of PepMoV 
and its interactions with host plants. Comparisons of symptom variations caused
by PepMoV isolates in plant hosts indicates a possible relationship between
symptom development and genetic variation. Researchers have investigated the
PepMoV-plant pathosystem to identify effective and durable genes that confer
resistance to the pathogen. As a result, several recessive pvr or dominant Pvr
resistance genes that confer resistance to PepMoV in pepper have been
characterized. On the other hand, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
interaction between these resistance genes and PepMoV-encoded genes remain
largely unknown. Our understanding of the molecular interactions between PepMoV
and host plants should be increased by reverse genetic approaches and
comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of both the virus and the host genes.
