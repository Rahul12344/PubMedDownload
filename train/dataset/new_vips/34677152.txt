Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggers important changes in routine blood
tests. In this retrospective case-control study, biochemical, hematological and
inflammatory biomarkers between March 10, 2020, and November 30, 2020 from 3969
COVID-19 patients (3746 in the non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) group and 223 in
the ICU group) were analyzed by dividing into three groups as spring, summer and 
autumn. In the non-ICU group, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio was lower in autumn
than the other two seasons and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in
autumn than the other two seasons. Also, monocyte and platelet were higher in
spring than autumn; and eosinophil, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocyte, and red
blood cells decreased from spring to autumn. In the non-ICU group, alanine
aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase gradually increased from spring to
autumn, while albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, total bilirubin and total
protein gradually decreased. Additionally, C-reactive protein was higher in
autumn than the other seasons, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was higher in
autumn than summer. The changes in routine blood biomarkers in COVID-19 varied
from the emergence of the disease until now. Also, the timely changes of blood
biomarkers were mostly more negative, indicating that the disease progresses
severely. The study was approved by the Erzincan Binali Yildirim University
Non-interventional Clinical Trials Ethic Committee (approval No. 86041) on June
21, 2021.
