OBJECTIVE: To explore mortality risk factors for patients hospitalised with
COVID-19 in a critical care unit (CCU) or a hospital care unit (HCU).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis using the French national (Programme de
médicalisation des systèmes d'information) database.
SETTING: Any public or private hospital in France.
PARTICIPANTS: 98 366 patients admitted with COVID-19 for more than 1 day during
the first semester of 2020 were included. The underlying conditions were
retrieved for all contiguous stays.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and associated risk factors were
assessed using frailty Cox models.
RESULTS: Among the 98 366 patients included, 25 765 (26%) were admitted to a CCU.
The median age was 66 (IQR: 55-76) years in CCUs and 74 (IQR: 57-85) years in
HCUs. Age was the main risk factor of death in both CCUs and HCUs, with adjusted 
HRs (aHRs) in CCUs increasing from 1.60 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.88) for 46 to 65 years 
to 8.17 (95% CI 6.86 to 9.72) for ≥85 years. In HCUs, the aHR associated with age
was more than two times higher. The gender was not significantly associated with 
death, aHR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, p=0.2693) in CCUs. Most of the underlying
chronic conditions were risk factors for death, including malignant neoplasm
(CCU: 1.34 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.43); HCU: 1.41 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.47)), cirrhosis
without transplant (1.41 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.64); 1.27 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.45)) and
dementia (1.30 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.46); 1.07 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.12)).
CONCLUSION: This analysis confirms the role of age as the major risk factor of
death in patients with COVID-19 irrespective to admission to critical care and
therefore supports the current vaccination policies targeting older individuals.
