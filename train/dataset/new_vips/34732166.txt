BACKGROUND: Despite being an uncommon cause of meningoencephalitis, West Nile
virus (WNV) recently provoked significant outbreaks throughout Europe. West Nile 
neuroinvasive disease (WNND) is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality in older and compromised individuals, while its diagnosis may be
demanding for the clinician. Here discussed are three cases of WNND with a focus 
on the diagnostic challenges they presented due to atypical clinical presentation
and laboratory findings.
CASE PRESENTATION: Between July and September 2020 three patients presented to
our attention with signs and symptoms compatible with meningoencephalitis. Among 
routine procedures, they underwent lumbar puncture and imaging. In the absence of
microbiological isolates, biological samples were sent for serology and NAATs for
WNV. Following diagnosis, the patients gradually recovered and were discharged
either home or to rehabilitation facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory findings here discussed, in particular CSF
parameters, are only partially consistent with those described in the literature,
which highlights the need for further research. While serology and NAATs on blood
and urine appear the most reliable techniques in the diagnostic work-up of WNND, 
utility of NAATs on CSF specimens is limited by the kinetics of WNV viremia in
biological fluids. This report underlines that WNND should always be included in 
the differential diagnosis of meningoencephalitis during WNV transmission period.
