Increasing studies demonstrated that oncolytic activities of oHSV-1 are limited
to the capacity of virus replicating in tumors. In order to potentiate the oHSV-1
oncolytic activity and expand the application of oHSV-1 treatment in multiple
types of tumors, it is critical to explore the potential factors or mechanisms
mediating tumor resistance to oHSV-1 infection. Here we evaluated the levels of
oHSV-1 multiplication in various tumor cell lines and showed that glioblastoma
cell line A172 had the lowest virus yields but intrinsically accumulated the
highest levels of Mx2 protein. Subsequently we demonstrated that genetic
depletion of Mx2 specifically enhanced oHSV-1 productive replication in A172
cells through promoting the nuclear translocation of uncoated viral genomic DNA
and down-regulating innate antiviral response. In the further investigation, we
found that Mx2 knockdown could alter the intrinsic mRNA accumulation of diverse
sets innate immune genes in A172 cells, in particular DHX36 and MyD88. Mx2
depletion led to a decrease in mRNA levels of MyD88 and DHX36 in A172 cells and
MyD88/DHX36 knockdown increased virus yield in A172 cells and decreased the
production of IFNα, activation of IRF3 activity and NF-κB signaling in A172
cells. This shed new lights on understanding the roles of some intrinsic
antiviral genes in oHSV-1 resistance, facilitating to offer potential targets to 
improve oHSV-1 oncolytic efficacy and develop candidates of biomarkers to predict
the efficiency of oHSV-1 multiplication in tumors.
