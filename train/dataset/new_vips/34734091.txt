Background. Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common arboviral disease
that affects tropical and subtropical regions. Based on the clinical hallmarks,
the different severities of patients range from mild dengue fever (MDF) to severe
dengue diseases (SDDs) and include dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock
syndrome. These are commonly associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The
types and levels of cytokines/chemokines, which are suppressed or enhanced, are
varied, indicating CRS's pathogenic and host defensive effects. Principal
Finding. In this study, we created an integrated and precise multiplex panel of
cytokine/chemokine assays based on our literature analysis to monitor dengue CRS.
A 24-plex panel of cytokines/chemokines was evaluated to measure the plasma
levels of targeting factors in dengue patients with an MDF and SDD diagnosis
without or with comorbidities. As identified in sixteen kinds of
cytokines/chemokines, ten were significantly (P < 0.05) (10/16) increased, one
was significantly (P < 0.01) (1/16) decreased, and five were potentially (5/16)
altered in all dengue patients (n = 30) in the acute phase of disease onset.
Compared to MDF, the levels of IL-8 (CXCL-8) and IL-18 in SDD were markedly (P < 
0.05) increased, accompanied by positively increased IL-6 and TNF-α and decreased
IFN-γ and RANTES. With comorbidities, SDD significantly (P < 0.01) portrayed
elevated IL-18 accompanied by increased IL-6 and decreased IFN-α2 and IL-12. In
addition, decreased platelets were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with
increased IL-18. Significance. These results demonstrate an efficient panel of
dengue cytokine/chemokine assays used to explore the possible level of CRS during
the acute phase of disease onset; also, we are the first to report the increase
of IL-18 in severe dengue with comorbidity compared to severe dengue without
comorbidity and mild dengue.
