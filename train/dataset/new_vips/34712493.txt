The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect up to 30% of 
the world population, leading to lifelong chronic infection of the brain and
muscle tissue. Although most latent T. gondii infections in humans have
traditionally been considered asymptomatic, studies in rodents suggest phenotypic
neurological changes are possible. Consequently, several studies have examined
the link between T. gondii infection and diseases such as schizophrenia,
epilepsy, depression, bipolar disorder, dysphoria, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To date, there is
varying evidence of the relationship of T. gondii to these human neurological or 
neurobehavioral disorders. A thorough review of T. gondii literature was
conducted to highlight and summarize current findings. We found that
schizophrenia was most frequently linked to T. gondii infection, while sleep
disruption showed no linkage to T. gondii infection, and other conditions having 
mixed support for a link to T. gondii. However, infection as a cause of human
neurobehavioral disease has yet to be firmly established.
