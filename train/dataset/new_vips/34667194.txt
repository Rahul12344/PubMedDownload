Upon virus infections, the rapid and comprehensive transcriptional reprogramming 
in host plant cells is critical to ward off virus attack. To uncover genes and
defense pathways that are associated with virus resistance, we carried out the
transcriptome-wide Illumina RNA-Seq analysis of pepper leaves harboring the L3
resistance gene at 4, 8, 24 and 48 h post-inoculation (hpi) with two
tobamoviruses. Obuda pepper virus (ObPV) inoculation led to hypersensitive
reaction (incompatible interaction), while Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)
inoculation resulted in a systemic infection without visible symptoms (compatible
interaction). ObPV induced robust changes in the pepper transcriptome, whereas
PMMoV showed much weaker effects. ObPV markedly suppressed genes related to
photosynthesis, carbon fixation and photorespiration. On the other hand, genes
associated with energy producing pathways, immune receptors, signaling cascades, 
transcription factors, pathogenesis-related proteins, enzymes of terpenoid
biosynthesis and ethylene metabolism as well as glutathione S-transferases were
markedly activated by ObPV. Genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation
were slightly suppressed also by PMMoV. However, PMMoV did not influence
significantly the disease signaling and defense pathways. RNA-Seq results were
validated by real-time qPCR for ten pepper genes. Our findings provide a deeper
insight into defense mechanisms underlying tobamovirus resistance in pepper.
