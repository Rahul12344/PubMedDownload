Nucleotide analogs are the cornerstone of direct acting antivirals used to
control infection by RNA viruses. Here we review what is known about existing
nucleotide/nucleoside analogs and the kinetics and mechanisms of RNA and DNA
replication, with emphasis on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
in comparison to HIV reverse transcriptase and Hepatitis C RdRp. We demonstrate
how accurate kinetic analysis reveals surprising results to explain the
effectiveness of antiviral nucleoside analogs providing guidelines for the design
of new inhibitors.
