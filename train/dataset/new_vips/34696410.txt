Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes a viral disease of high epidemiological
and economical significance that affects domestic and wild swine. Control of the 
disease in endemic countries is based on live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) that
induce an early protective immune response against highly virulent CSFV strains. 
The main disadvantage of these currently available LAVs is the lack of
serological techniques to differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals
(DIVA concept). Here, we describe the development of the FlagDIVA test, a
serological diagnostic tool allowing for the differentiation between animals
vaccinated with the FlagT4G candidate and those infected with CSFV field strains.
The FlagDIVA test is a direct ELISA based on a dendrimeric peptide construct
displaying a conserved epitope of CSFV structural protein E2. Although FlagDIVA
detected anti-CSFV anti-bodies in infected animals, it did not recognize the
antibody response of FlagT4G-vaccinated animals. Therefore, the FlagDIVA test
constitutes a valuable accessory DIVA tool in implementing vaccination with the
FlagT4G candidate.
