Older people with HIV (PWH) experience heightened risk for the acquisition of
cumulative, multisystem decline, i.e., frailty syndrome. Frailty relates to
poorer sleep quality in the general older adult population; however, this
association has yet to be explored among PWH. A cross-sectional analysis of 285
PWH ≥50 years old (mean age 60.5 ± 7.0) examined the relationship between frailty
(Fried frailty phenotype) and self-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index; PSQI). Three separate multivariable linear regression models
examined global PSQI as a function of (1) frailty phenotype, (2) total number of 
frailty symptoms, or (3) specific individual frailty symptoms. Models covaried
for demographic and biopsychosocial risk factors including age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, premorbid verbal IQ estimate, current depressive
symptoms, and diagnosis of a substance abuse disorder. Compared to non-frail
(B=.151; p=.021) and prefrail (B=.144; p=.021), frail phenotype was related to
poorer sleep quality (increased global PSQI; F(5,278)=11.34, p<.001; R2=.17).
Increased number of frailty symptoms (B=.144; p=.019; F(4,276)=12.719, p<.001;
R2=.16) and exhaustion were associated with increased global PSQI scores (B=.218,
p<.001; F(6,247)=10.436, p<.001; R2=.19). In all models, older age, female sex,
and elevated current depressive symptoms were associated with poorer sleep
quality. In older PWH, greater frailty symptoms related to poorer sleep quality, 
independent of psychosocial risk factors for poor sleep. Frailty and poor sleep
individually have adverse effects on health and everyday functioning; thus,
establishing this association may better aid providers to screen for and treat
problems with sleep quality and/or frailty among PWH.
