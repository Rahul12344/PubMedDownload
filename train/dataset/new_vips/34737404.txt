With a limited coding capacity of 4.7 kb, adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome has
evolved over-lapping genes to maximise the usage of its genome. An example is the
recently found ORF in the cap gene, encoding membrane-associated accessory
protein (MAAP), located in the same genomic region as the VP1/2 unique domain,
but in a different reading frame. This 13 KDa protein, unique to the dependovirus
genus, is not homologous to any known protein. Our studies confirm that MAAP
translation initiates from the first CTG codon found in the VP1 ORF2. We have
further observed MAAP localised in the plasma membrane, in the membranous
structures in close proximity to the nucleus and to the nuclear envelope by
co-transfecting with plasmids encoding the wild-type AAV (wt-AAV) genome and
adenovirus (Ad) helper genes. While keeping VP1/2 protein sequence identical,
both inactivation and truncation of MAAP translation affected the emergence and
intracellular distribution of the AAV capsid proteins. We have demonstrated that 
MAAP facilitates AAV replication and has a role in controlling Ad infection.
Additionally, we were able to improve virus production and capsid integrity
through a C-terminal truncation of MAAP while other modifications led to
increased packaging of contaminating, non-viral DNA. Our results show that MAAP
plays a significant role in AAV infection, with profound implications for the
production of therapeutic AAV vectors.
