PURPOSE: This population-based open cohort study aims to investigate biological
and sociodemographic drivers of malaria transmission in the main urban hotspot of
Amazonian Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS: Nearly 20% of the households in the northwestern town of Mâncio
Lima were randomly selected and 2690 participants were enrolled since April 2018.
Sociodemographic, housing quality, occupational, behavioural and morbidity
information and travel histories were collected during consecutive study visits. 
Blood samples from participants>3 months old were used for malaria diagnosis and 
human genetic studies; samples from participants with laboratory-confirmed
malaria have been cryopreserved for genetic and phenotypic characterisation of
parasites. Serology was introduced in 2020 to measure the prevalence and
longevity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.
FINDINGS TO DATE: Malaria prevalence rates were low (up to 1.0% for Plasmodium
vivax and 0.6% for P. falciparum) during five consecutive cross-sectional surveys
between April-May 2018 and October-November 2020; 63% of infections diagnosed by 
microscopy were asymptomatic. Malaria risk is heterogeneously distributed, with
20% study participants contributing 86% of the overall burden of P. vivax
infection. Adult males are at greatest risk of infection and human mobility
across the urban-rural interface may contribute to sustained malaria
transmission. Local P. vivax parasites are genetically diverse and fragmented
into discrete inbred lineages that remain stable across space and time.
FUTURE PLANS: Two follow-up visits, with similar study protocols, are planned in 
2021. We aim to identify high-risk individuals that fuel onwards malaria
transmission and represent a priority target for more intensive and effective
control interventions.
