Viral outbreaks had been a threat for the human race for a long time. Several
epidemics and pandemics have been reported in the past with serious consequences 
on human health and subsequent social and economic aspects. According to WHO,
viral infections continue to be a major health concern globally. Novel
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) causes 
the most recent infectious pandemic disease, COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-19).
As of now, there were 249 million infections of COVID-19 worldwide with a high
mortality of more than 5 million deaths reported; and the number of new
additional cases is drastically increasing. Development of therapies to treat the
infected cases and prophylactic agents including vaccines that are effective
towards different variants are crucial to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to
the fact that there is a high mortality and morbidity rate along with the risk of
virus causing further epidemic outbursts, development of additional effective
therapeutic and preventive strategies are highly warranted. Prevention, early
detection and treatment will reduce the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The present 
review highlights the novel mutations and therapeutic updates associated with
coronaviruses along with the clinical manifestations-diagnosis, clinical
management and, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies of COVID-19 infection.
