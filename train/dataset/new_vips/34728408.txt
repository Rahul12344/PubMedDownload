BACKGROUND: It remains unclear if patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or
asthma are susceptible to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection,
severity, and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of AR and/or asthma in COVID-19 infection,
severity, and mortality, and assess whether long-term AR and/or asthma
medications affected the outcomes of COVID-19.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 70,557 adult participants completed
SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 16 and December 31, 2020, in the UK Biobank were
analyzed. The rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality in
relation to pre-existing AR and/or asthma were assessed based on adjusted
generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of long-term AR and/or 
asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality.
RESULTS: Patients with AR of all ages had lower positive rates of SARS-CoV-2
tests (relative risk [RR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.81, P <
.001), with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.85, P < .001)
than females (RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.72-0.9, P < .001). However, similar effects of
asthma against COVID-19 hospitalization were only major in participants aged <65 
(RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-1, P = .044) instead of elderlies. In contrast, patients 
with asthma tested positively had higher risk of hospitalization (RR: 1.42, 95%
CI: 1.32-1.54, P < .001). Neither AR nor asthma had an impact on COVID-19
mortality. None of conventional medications for AR or asthma, for example,
antihistamines, corticosteroids, or β2 adrenoceptor agonists, showed association 
with COVID-19 infection or severity.
CONCLUSION: AR (all ages) and asthma (aged <65) act as protective factors against
COVID-19 infection, whereas asthma increases risk for COVID-19 hospitalization.
None of the long-term medications had a significant association with infection,
severity, and mortality of COVID-19 among patients with AR and/or asthma.
