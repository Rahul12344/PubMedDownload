We determined the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in fifteen
hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients were divided into mild/moderate (mild, n
= 1; moderate, n = 4) or severe (n = 10) and virus-specific anti-Nucleocapsid
IgM, anti-Spike IgG and anti-Spike IgA were measured in serial serum samples
collected 0 to 15 days after hospital admission. Surrogate neutralization assays 
were performed by testing inhibition of ACE-2 binding to Spike. In 3 patients (2 
severe and 1 moderate case), serum antibodies and T-cell memory were monitored 6 
months after baseline. Although IgM response tended to appear first, patients
affected by less severe disease were more prone to an early IgG/IgA response.
Neutralization of Spike binding to ACE2 correlated with anti-Spike IgG and IgA.
IgG and IgA antibody response persisted at the 6 months follow-up. A recall
T-cell response to the Spike antigen was observed in 2 out of 3 patients, not
related to disease severity.
