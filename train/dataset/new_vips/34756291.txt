Gynecologic cancers contribute to a significant portion of cancer morbidity and
mortality among women in the United States and across the globe. This article
provides a comprehensive review of current screening guidelines and novel
techniques that have promise in the prevention and early detection of gynecologic
cancers in the future. The authors anticipate a move toward less invasive testing
modalities, use of cancer biomarkers, and the prevention and treatment of
high-risk factors such as human papilloma virus infection and obesity.
