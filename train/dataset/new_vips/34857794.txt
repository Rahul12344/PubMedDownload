The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for the identification of
new antiviral drug therapies for a variety of diseases. COVID-19 is caused by
infection with the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, while other related human
coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from severe respiratory infections to the
common cold. We developed a computational approach to identify new antiviral drug
targets and repurpose clinically-relevant drug compounds for the treatment of a
range of human coronavirus diseases. Our approach is based on graph convolutional
networks (GCN) and involves multiscale host-virus interactome analysis coupled to
off-target drug predictions. Cell-based experimental assessment reveals several
clinically-relevant drug repurposing candidates predicted by the in silico
analyses to have antiviral activity against human coronavirus infection. In
particular, we identify the MET inhibitor capmatinib as having potent and broad
antiviral activity against several coronaviruses in a MET-independent manner, as 
well as novel roles for host cell proteins such as IRAK1/4 in supporting human
coronavirus infection, which can inform further drug discovery studies.
