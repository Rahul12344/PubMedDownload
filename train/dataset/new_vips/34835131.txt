Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced lower COVID-19 caseloads
and fewer deaths than countries in other regions worldwide. Under-reporting of
cases and a younger population could partly account for these differences, but
pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses is another potential factor. Blood samples
from Sierra Leonean Lassa fever and Ebola survivors and their contacts collected 
before the first reported COVID-19 cases were assessed using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays for the presence of antibodies binding to proteins of
coronaviruses that infect humans. Results were compared to COVID-19 subjects and 
healthy blood donors from the United States. Prior to the pandemic, Sierra
Leoneans had more frequent exposures than Americans to coronaviruses with
epitopes that cross-react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV). The percentage of Sierra Leoneans with antibodies reacting to
seasonal coronaviruses was also higher than for American blood donors.
Serological responses to coronaviruses by Sierra Leoneans did not differ by age
or sex. Approximately a quarter of Sierra Leonian pre-pandemic blood samples had 
neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, while about a third
neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Prior exposures to coronaviruses that induce
cross-protective immunity may contribute to reduced COVID-19 cases and deaths in 
Sierra Leone.
