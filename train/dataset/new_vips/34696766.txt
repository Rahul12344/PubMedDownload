BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a disease of varying presentation and neurological
sequelae of the disease are being studied. Following a cluster of paediatric
facial nerve palsy (FNP) cases in an area of South Wales with a high prevalence
of COVID-19, we conducted an opportunistic study to determine whether there has
been an increase of incidence of FNP and if there is an association between the
FNP and COVID-19 in children.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the incidence of FNP between 2015
and 2020 across two hospitals within the health board. The incidence was compared
with that in 2020 including a cluster of six children in 14 weeks, presenting to 
Royal Glamorgan Hospital between June and October.
RESULTS: There were 48 cases of children with FNP across both hospital within the
study years. Seven (7) cases in 2020. The incidence was not statistically
different in comparison to other years. Five out of six of these children in 2020
had antibody testing for COVID-19. All serology testing (100%) returned negative 
for SARS-CoV- 2 antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: In high prevalence area for COVID-19, cases of children with FNP
have not shown a commensurate increase. we have found no causal link between
COVID-19 and FNP in children. While this is a small study, larger cohort studies 
are needed to support this finding. As new strains of COVID-19 are being reported
in UK, South Africa and Brazil, physicians need to continue to be vigilant for
consistent pattern of signs and symptoms, especially in children.
