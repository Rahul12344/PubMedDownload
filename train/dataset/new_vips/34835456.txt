Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) might be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to bind
and enter the host cell. Recently reported mutations in the spike glycoprotein
unique to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different variants might increase 
the binding and pathogenesis. However, it is still not known how these mutations 
affect the binding of RBD to GRP78. The current study provides a structural basis
for the binding of GRP78 to the different variants, i.e., B.1.1.7, B.1.351,
B.1.617, and P.1 (spike RBD), of SARS-CoV-2 using a biomolecular simulation
approach. Docking results showed that the new variants bound stronger than the
wild-type, which was further confirmed through the free energy calculation
results. All-atom simulation confirmed structural stability, which was consistent
with previous results by following the global stability trend. We concluded that 
the increased binding affinity of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants was due 
to a variation in the bonding network that helped the virus induce a higher
infectivity and disease severity. Consequently, we reported that the
aforementioned new variants use GRP78 as an alternate receptor to enhance their
seriousness.
