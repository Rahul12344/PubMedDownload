The emergence, in recent decades, of an entirely new area of "Mitochondrial
dynamics", which consists principally of fission and fusion, reflects the
recognition that mitochondria play a significant role in human tumorigenesis and 
response to therapeutics. Proteins that determine mitochondrial dynamics are
referred to as "shaping proteins". Marked heterogeneity has been observed in the 
response of tumor cells to chemotherapy, which is associated with imbalances in
mitochondrial dynamics and function leading to adaptive and acquired resistance
to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, targeting mitochondria-shaping proteins
may prove to be a promising approach to treat chemotherapy resistant cancers. In 
this review, we summarize the alterations of mitochondrial dynamics in
chemotherapeutic processing and the antitumor mechanisms by which chemotherapy
drugs synergize with mitochondria-shaping proteins. These might shed light on new
biomarkers for better prediction of cancer chemosensitivity and contribute to the
exploitation of potent therapeutic strategies for the clinical treatment of
cancers.
