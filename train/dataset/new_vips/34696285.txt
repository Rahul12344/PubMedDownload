Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes PRRS and is
known to effectively suppress host innate immunity. The current strategies for
controlling PRRSV are limited and complete understanding of anti-PRRSV innate
immunity is needed. Here, we utilized nine porcine innate immune signaling
adaptors which represent all currently known innate immune receptor signaling
pathways for screening of anti-PRRSV activity. The analysis of PRRSV N gene
transcription and protein expression both suggested that the multiple ectopic
adaptors exhibited varying degrees of anti-PRRSV activities, with TRIF and MAVS
most effective. To better quantify the PRRSV replication, the GFP signal of PRRSV
from reverse genetics were measured by flow cytometry and similarly varying
anti-PRRSV activities by different signaling adaptors were observed. Based on the
screening data, and considering the importance of viral nucleic acid in innate
immune response, endogenous TRIF, MAVS and STING were selected for further
examination of anti-PRRSV activity. Agonist stimulation assay showed that MAVS
and STING signaling possessed significant anti-PRRSV activities, whereas siRNA
knockdown assay showed that TRIF, MAVS and STING are all involved in anti-PRRSV
activity, with TLR3-TRIF displaying discrepancy in anti-PRRSV infection.
Nevertheless, our work suggests that multiple pattern recognition receptor (PRR) 
signaling pathways are involved in anti-PRRSV innate immunity, which may have
implications for the development of future antiviral strategies.
