Metabolic pathways regulate immune responses and disrupted metabolism leads to
immune dysfunction and disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is driven by 
imbalanced immune responses, yet the role of immunometabolism in COVID-19
pathogenesis remains unclear. By investigating 87 patients with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 critically ill non-COVID-19 patients, and 47 uninfected
controls, we found an immunometabolic dysregulation in patients with progressed
COVID-19. Specifically, T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes exhibited increased 
mitochondrial mass, yet only T cells accumulated intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS), were metabolically quiescent, and showed a disrupted mitochondrial
architecture. During recovery, T cell ROS decreased to match the uninfected
controls. Transcriptionally, T cells from severe/critical COVID-19 patients
showed an induction of ROS-responsive genes as well as genes related to
mitochondrial function and the basigin network. Basigin (CD147) ligands
cyclophilin A and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggered ROS production in T
cells in vitro. In line with this, only PCR-positive patients showed increased
ROS levels. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a downregulation of ROS in vitro 
and T cells from dexamethasone-treated patients exhibited low ROS and basigin
levels. This was reflected by changes in the transcriptional landscape. Our
findings provide evidence of an immunometabolic dysregulation in COVID-19 that
can be mitigated by dexamethasone treatment.
