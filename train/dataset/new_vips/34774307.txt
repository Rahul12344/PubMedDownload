BACKGROUND: Since 1964 when Indiana University performed its first kidney
transplant, immunosuppression protocol was steroid-based until 2004 when
steroid-free immunosuppression protocol was adopted. We describe clinical
outcomes on our patients administered early steroid withdrawal (ESW) protocol (5 
days) compared with our historical cohort (HC), who were on chronic steroid-based
immunosuppression.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study evaluating kidney transplant
recipients between 1993 and 2003 (HC, n = 1689) and between 2005 and 2016 (ESW
cohort, n = 2097) at the Indiana University program, with a median follow-up of
10.5 years and 6.1 years, respectively. Primary outcomes were patient and
death-censored graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years in both study cohorts.
Secondary outcomes were 1-year rates of biopsy-proven acute rejection; graft
function at 1, 3, and 5 years; and risk of post-transplant infection (BK virus
and cytomegalovirus) in the ESW cohort. Cox proportional model and Kaplan-Meier
estimates were used to estimate survival probabilities. Fisher exact tests were
used to compare episodes of acute rejection in the ESW cohort.
RESULTS: No difference was observed in patient survival between the ESW and HC
cohorts (P = .13). Compared with the ESW cohort, death-censored graft survival
was significantly worse in the HC (5 year: 86.4% vs 90.6%, log-rank P < .001).
One-year acute rejection reported in the ESW cohort alone was 15.7% and
significantly worse in Black patients and younger patients (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: In this sizeable single-center cohort study with significant ethnic 
diversity, ESW is a viable alternative to steroid-based immunosuppression
protocol in kidney transplant recipients.
