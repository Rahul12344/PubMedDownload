From the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, the use of face masks has been adapted as
one of the main measures to slow down the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
worldwide. The inadequate handling and management of face masks lead to a massive
dispersal in the environment, resulting in a new source of microfibers because of
their breakdown and/or degradation. In addition, the laundering of reusable face 
masks of different polymeric composition can represent an additional sources of
microfibers to natural ecosystems, but it was largely neglected. The present
study explored the release of synthetic or natural microfibers from reusable and 
disposable face masks of five different fabrics when subjected to a cycle of
laundering in a domestic washing machine. After a single wash, face masks
released an average (± SE) of 284.94 ± 73.66 microfibers, independently of the
fabrics. Focusing on the fabrics composing the face masks, polyurethane
(541.33 ± 51.84 microfibers) and cotton-based (823.00 ± 112.53 microfibers) face 
masks released the highest amount of synthetic and natural microfibers,
respectively. Considering the crucial role of face masks to counteract the
pandemic and the increasing trend of their use, further studies represent a
priority to estimate the contribution of face mask-derived microfibers to
freshwater contamination.
