INTRODUCTION: Nursing home residents were the most vulnerable population to be
affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy. The Italian vaccination
strategy decided to indicate them as the target population in the first phase of 
the massive vaccination campaign. We carried out an analysis on an outbreak of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection which
occurred in a nursing home in northern Italy (Cremona) after the administration
of the complete vaccination cycle affecting most of the guests of the structure.
METHODS: Data relating to the outbreak were obtained through the Regional
Surveillance System for Infectious Diseases of Lombardia Region.
RESULTS: During the outbreak, among the 61 guests, 56 were vaccinated. Thirty
four were found positive for COVID-19: 22 were asymptomatic, 12 were symptomatic 
and 4 died. The observed difference in the number of deaths between vaccinated
and non-vaccinated subjects was significant. During the outbreak 104 healthcare
workers (HCWs) were employed in the nursing home, only 66 were vaccinated. Eight 
HCWs were found COVID-19 positive, 4 of them were vaccinated and of female
gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Similarly to data reported in literature for described outbreaks, we
observed that the vaccine is able to protect from the symptomatic form and a
valid antibody response protect from a symptomatic disease. The low number of
HCWs found positive indicates a correct use of individual protective devices.
