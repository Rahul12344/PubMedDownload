BACKGROUND: Remote consultations (RCs) enable clinicians to continue to support
patients when face-to-face appointments are not possible. Restrictions to
face-to-face care during the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a pre-existing
trend for their adoption. This is true for many health professionals including
some chiropractors. Whilst most chiropractors in the UK have used RCs in some
form during the pandemic, others have not. This study seeks to understand the
views of chiropractors not using RCs and to explore perceived potential barriers.
METHODS: A national online survey was completed by 534 registered practicing UK
chiropractors on the use of RCs. Respondents had the opportunity of providing
open-ended responses concerning lack of engagement in RCs during the COVID-19
pandemic. Textual responses obtained from 137 respondents were coded and analysed
using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The use of RCs provided an opportunity for chiropractors to deliver
ongoing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many chiropractors expressed 
concern that RCs misaligned with their strong professional identity of providing 
'hands-on' care. Some chiropractors also perceived that patients expected
physical interventions during chiropractic care and thus considered a lack of
demand when direct contact is not possible. In the absence of a physical
examination, some chiropractors had concerns about potential misdiagnosis, and
perceived lack of diagnostic information with which to guide treatment. Clinic
closures and change in working environment led to practical difficulties of
providing remote care for a few chiropractors.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated changes in the way
healthcare is provided with RCs becoming more commonplace in primary healthcare
provision. This paper highlights perceived barriers which may lead to reduced
utilisation of RCs by chiropractors, some of which appear fundamental to their
perceived identity, whilst others are likely amenable to change with training and
experience.
