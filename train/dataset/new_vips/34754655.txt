Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy lies in the severe spectrum of 
HIV-associated neurological disorder (HAND) and ranges from asymptomatic
condition to minor neurological features to severe dementia. Cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) analysis helps to rule out the presence of other opportunistic infections. 
Neuroimaging helps establish the diagnosis. We report a case of a 39-year-old
African American female who presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute
multiple sclerosis (MS) flares in the setting of advanced acute immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) encephalopathy. She presented with bilateral lower extremity
muscle weakness and pain with apparent cognitive decline. Notable laboratory
findings included leukopenia with normal neutrophils and positive serology for
HIV-1. The MRI showed mild post-contrast enhancement suggestive of demyelinating 
disease, favoring MS over progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was significant for positive oligoclonal bands and
negative serology. She was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for AIDS while
holding steroids due to the possibility of worsening AIDS. After treatment for
HIV, she showed immunologic and functional status improvement. HIV encephalopathy
must be diagnosed by ruling out other similar presenting neurological illnesses
for tactful patient management.
