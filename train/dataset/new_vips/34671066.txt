Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by
progressively enlarging cysts. Here we elucidate the interplay between oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic derangement using two mouse
models of PKD1 mutation, PKD1RC/null and PKD1RC/RC. Mouse kidneys with PKD1
mutation have decreased mitochondrial complexes activity. Targeted proteomics
analysis shows a significant decrease in proteins involved in the TCA cycle,
fatty acid oxidation (FAO), respiratory complexes, and endogenous antioxidants.
Overexpressing mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mCAT) using adeno-associated
virus reduces mitochondrial ROS, oxidative damage, ameliorates the progression of
PKD and partially restores expression of proteins involved in FAO and the TCA
cycle. In human ADPKD cells, inducing mitochondrial ROS increased ERK1/2
phosphorylation and decreased AMPK phosphorylation, whereas the converse was
observed with increased scavenging of ROS in the mitochondria. Treatment with the
mitochondrial protective peptide, SS31, recapitulates the beneficial effects of
mCAT, supporting its potential application as a novel therapeutic for ADPKD.
