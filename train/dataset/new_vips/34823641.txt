Since December 2019, over 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2-related fatalities have been
recorded in the World Health Organization European Region - 90.2% in people ≥ 60 
years. We calculated lives saved in this age group by COVID-19 vaccination in 33 
countries from December 2020 to November 2021, using weekly reported deaths and
vaccination coverage. We estimated that vaccination averted 469,186 deaths (51%
of 911,302 expected deaths; sensitivity range: 129,851-733,744; 23-62%). Impact
by country ranged 6-93%, largest when implementation was early.
