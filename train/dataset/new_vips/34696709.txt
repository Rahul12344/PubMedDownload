The Flavivirus genus consists of >70 members including several that are
considered significant human pathogens. Flaviviruses display a broad spectrum of 
diseases that can be roughly categorised into two phenotypes - systemic disease
involving haemorrhage exemplified by dengue and yellow Fever virus, and
neurological complications associated with the likes of West Nile and Zika
viruses. Attempts to develop vaccines have been variably successful against some.
Besides, mosquito-borne flaviviruses can be vertically transmitted in the
arthropods, enabling long term persistence and the possibility of re-emergence.
Therefore, developing strategies to combat disease is imperative even if vaccines
become available. The cellular interactions of flaviviruses with their human
hosts are key to establishing the viral lifecycle on the one hand, and activation
of host immunity on the other. The latter should ideally eradicate infection, but
often leads to immunopathological and neurological consequences. In this review, 
we use Dengue and Zika viruses to discuss what we have learned about the cellular
and molecular determinants of the viral lifecycle and the accompanying
immunopathology, while highlighting current knowledge gaps which need to be
addressed in future studies.
