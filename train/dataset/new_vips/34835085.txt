INTRODUCTION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk for
venous thromboembolism (VTE), but also for bleeding. We previously derived a
prognostic score including four variables (elevated D-dimer, elevated ferritin,
critical illness, and therapeutic-dose anticoagulation) that identified those at 
increased risk for major bleeding.
METHODS: We aimed to validate the score in a subsequent cohort of hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 receiving standard-, intermediate- or therapeutic doses of
VTE prophylaxis. We evaluated its capacity to predict major bleeding, non-major
bleeding, and bleeding-related death.
RESULTS: The cohort included 972 patients from 29 hospitals, of whom 280 (29%)
received standard-; 412 (42%) intermediate-, 157 (16%) therapeutic doses of VTE
prophylaxis and 123 (13%) other drugs. Median duration of prophylaxis was 14.7 ± 
10.3 days. Major bleeding occurred in 65 patients (6.7%) and non-major bleeding
in 67 (6.9%). Thirty patients with major bleeding (46%) died within the first 30 
days after bleeding. The prognostic score identified 203 patients (21%) at very
low risk, 285 (29%) at low risk, 263 (27%) intermediate-risk and 221 (23%) at
high risk for bleeding. Major bleeding occurred in 1.0%, 2.1%, 8.7% and 15.4% of 
the patients, respectively. Non-major bleeding occurred in 0.5%, 3.5%, 9.5% and
14.2%, respectively. The c-statistics was: 0.74 (95% confidence intervals [CI]:
0.68-0.79) for major bleeding, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67-0.78) for non-major bleeding
and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.87) for bleeding-related death.
CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we validated that a
prognostic score including 4 easily available items may identify those at
increased risk for bleeding.
