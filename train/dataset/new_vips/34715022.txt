Ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal illness with the potential for global
spread. Monoclonal antibody-based treatments that have become available recently 
have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and are ineffective against ebolaviruses other
than Ebola virus (EBOV), including medically important Bundibugyo (BDBV) and
Sudan (SUDV) viruses. Here, we report the development of a therapeutic cocktail
comprising two broadly neutralizing human antibodies, rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-442,
that recognize non-overlapping sites on the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP).
Antibodies in the cocktail exhibited synergistic neutralizing activity, resisted 
viral escape, and possessed differing requirements for their Fc-regions for
optimal in vivo activities. The cocktail protected non-human primates from
ebolavirus disease caused by EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV with high therapeutic
effectiveness. High-resolution structures of the cocktail antibodies in complex
with GP revealed the molecular determinants for neutralization breadth and
potency. This study provides advanced preclinical data to support clinical
development of this cocktail for pan-ebolavirus therapy.
