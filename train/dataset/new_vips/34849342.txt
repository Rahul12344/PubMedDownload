A single varicella infection usually causes lifelong immunity, so recurrent
varicella infection is considered rare. Reactivation of the virus as herpes
zoster usually develops after a latent period. Here, we report a case of a
48-year-old immunosuppressed patient who presented with rapid-onset symmetrical
bilateral papulovesicular eruptions on both legs 3 weeks after having recurrent
varicella infection that had been treated with intravenous acyclovir. Varicella
zoster virus (VZV) Ag testing was performed on vesicular lesions. The positive
result confirmed that VZV had reactivated. It presented in the form of herpes
zoster duplex bilateralis symmetricus. This condition is rare and occurs
primarily in immunocompromised female hosts.
