OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) was first 
detected in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. The emerging virus causes a
respiratory illness, that can trigger a cytokine storm in the body.
METHOD: Cytokine storm in patient's body is associated with severe forms of
disease. It is one of the main complications of coronavirus disease-2019
(COVID-19), in which immune cells play a major role. Studies have shown immune
cells in the tumor environment can be effective to induce resistance to
chemotherapy in cancer patients.
RESULT: Therefore, considering the role of immune cells to induce cytokine storm 
in COVID-19 patients, and their role to cause resistance to chemotherapy, they
are effective on disease progression and creation of severe form of disease.
CONCLUSION: By examining the signaling pathways and inducing resistance to
chemotherapy in tumor cells and the cells affect them, it is possible to prevent 
the occurrence of severe forms of the disease in cancer patients with COVID-19;
it is applicable using target therapy and other subsequent treatment strategies.
