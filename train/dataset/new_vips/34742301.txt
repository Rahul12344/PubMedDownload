BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) are among the high-risk groups in
contracting and dying from COVID-19. World Health Organization estimates that
over 10,000 HCWs in Africa have been infected with COVID-19 making it a
significant occupational health hazard to HCWs. In Ghana, over 100 HCWs have
already been infected and dozen others died from the virus. Acceptability and
uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is therefore critical to promote health and safety
of HCWs as the country battles out of a third wave of the pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: The study sought to ascertain the correlates of HCWs likelihood of
participating in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and accepting the vaccine when given
the opportunity.
METHODS: The study was a web-based cross-sectional survey among HCWs (n = 1605)
in all sixteen (16) administrative regions in Ghana. Data were analyzed with
STATA statistical analysis software (version 14). Chi-square (X2) and Fisher's
exact tests were used to test for differences in categorical variables; bivariate
probit regression analysis with Average Marginal Effect (AME) was employed to
ascertain the determinants of HCWs' likelihood of participating in a COVID-19
vaccine trial and taking the vaccine.
RESULTS: It was found that 48% of HCWs will participate in a COVID-19 vaccine
trial when given the opportunity; 70% will accept the COVID-19 vaccine; younger
HCWs (AME = 0.28, SE = 0.16, p < 0.1), non-Christians (AME = 21, SE = 0.09,
p < 0.05) and those who worked in faith-based health facilities (AME = 18,
SE = 0.07, p < 0.05) were more likely to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial.
Female HCWs (AME = - 11, SE = 0.04, p < 0.05) and those with lower educational
qualification were less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (AME = - 0.16,
SE = 0.08, p < 0.1). Reasons cited for unwillingness to participate in a COVID-19
vaccine trial or uptake the vaccine were mainly fear, safety concerns, mistrust, 
uncertainty, spiritual and religious beliefs.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine appear to be high among HCWs;
conversely, willingness to volunteer for the vaccine trial was low. Continuous
targeted and integrated public health education for HCWs will enhance vaccine
acceptability to promote safety and population health in the global south as
Ghana intensifies efforts to produce COVID-19 vaccines locally.
