INTRODUCTION: Having in mind the importance of providing continuous pediatric
dental services during the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that children have
similar viral loads to adults, the potential to spread the virus to others, and
with variable clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, this study aimed to
analyze the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on pediatric dentistry service provision,
risks, and preventive measures before and during dental treatment.
METHOD: Structured and closed epidemiological cross-sectional survey involved
seven Southeastern European countries. The questionnaire was developed using the 
modified Delphi method, pretested, and tested in North Italy during April 2020.
The sample consisted of licensed dental professionals reached via national dental
chambers and social media using the best strategies according to the national
setting.
RESULTS: A total of 3227 dentists participated in the survey, and we included 643
specialists in this study-among them, 164 were pediatric dentists. Most pediatric
dentists worked in the public sector (61.0%) and provided emergency (64.6%) and
routine dental treatment (18.3%) during the outbreak. One-third of pediatric
dentists were COVID-19 tested, statistically significantly more than other
specialties, and 3.0% tested COVID-19 positive. In addition, significantly more
pediatric dentists (13.4%) reported the presence of at least one symptom related 
to COVID-19 compared to other specialists (6.1%). None of the pediatric dentists 
reported PPE shortage. However, 26.2% of all specialists stated that they lacked 
clear step by step professional guidance in a national language. Similarly, in
both groups, around 10% of specialists attended education on coronavirus.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that most pediatric dentists provided dental treatment
during lockdown in their countries in public health centers and that they will
continue to work during pandemic, our results suggest that pediatric dentists
might be at higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Further research should focus on
finding better ways to promote and adapt preventive, protective measures and PPE 
in the pediatric dental setting to be behaviorally acceptable. Moreover,
additional efforts should be invested in dental education regarding COVID-19 in
the mother tongue.
