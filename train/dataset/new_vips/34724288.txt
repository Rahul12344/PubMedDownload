Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the preferred treatment to prevent
mother-to-infant transmission in highly viremic HBV-infected women. Data on
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels in pregnant women are lacking. We
aimed to investigate prepartum and postpartum HBsAg kinetics and its correlation 
with HBV DNA in pregnant women. HBV-infected mothers with HBV DNA ≥7.5 log10
 IU/ml were tested for HBsAg and HBV DNA from baseline to 6 months postpartum. Of
the 186 pregnant women with comparable baseline HBsAg and HBV DNA, 101 received
TDF from the third trimester until 1 month postpartum. At delivery, TDF group had
mildly lower HBsAg (4.32 ± 0.47 vs. 4.54 ± 0.35 log10  IU/ml, p = .0004) and
markedly lower HBV DNA (4.26 ± 0.97 vs. 8.11 ± 0.70 log10  IU/ml, p < .0001) than
the control group. In the TDF group, mean reduction of HBsAg and HBV DNA from
baseline to delivery were 0.22 ± 0.38 and 3.96 ± 0.93 log10  IU/ml. HBsAg
reduction had a positive correlation (r = .309; p = .0017) with HBV DNA
reduction, and was predictive of HBV DNA reduction ≥3 log10  IU/ml (area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.67; 95% confidence interval,
0.50-0.82). At 6 months postpartum, TDF and control group had comparable HBsAg
and HBV DNA. In conclusion, HBsAg decreased slightly at delivery in pregnant
women receiving TDF. For monitoring the effect of antiviral therapy during
pregnancy, HBV DNA is a better marker than HBsAg. Our data provided valuable
information regarding monitoring HBV-infected pregnant women using antiviral
therapy.
