BACKGROUND: The emergency measures implemented by the Nursing and Midwifery
Council in response to the COVID-19 pandemic provided nursing students in their
final 6 months of study with the opportunity to complete a paid consolidation
clinical placement and thus increase their personal responsibility for the care
they delivered under supervision.
AIM: To explore the experiences of third-year nursing students who completed
their final clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted via a virtual platform.
FINDINGS: Three themes were identified: the importance of support mechanisms, the
development of confidence, and innovative learning opportunities. Students
reported improved confidence in the transition period to registered practitioner 
and felt well supported, which enabled them to take greater responsibility.
CONCLUSION: This study provided insight into the experience of nursing students
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and found that support mechanisms, and a sense of
belonging, helped to increase their confidence in clinical practice.
