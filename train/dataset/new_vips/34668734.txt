Several human intestinal microbiota studies suggest that bacteriophages, viruses 
infecting bacteria, play a role in gut homeostasis. Currently, bacteriophages are
considered a tool to precisely engineer the intestinal microbiota, but they have 
also attracted considerable attention as a possible solution to fight against
bacterial pathogens resistant to antibiotics. These two applications necessitate 
bacteriophages to reach and kill their bacterial target within the gut
environment. Unfortunately, exploitable clinical data in this field are scarce.
Here, we review the administration of bacteriophages to target intestinal
bacteria in mammalian experimental models. While bacteriophage amplification in
the gut was often confirmed, we found that in most studies, it had no significant
impact on the load of the targeted bacteria. In particular, we observed that the 
outcome of bacteriophage treatments is linked to the behavior of the target
bacteria toward each animal model. Treatment efficacy ranges from poor in
asymptomatic intestinal carriage to high in intestinal disease. This broad range 
of efficacy underlines the difficulties to reach a consensus on the impact of
bacteriophages in the gut and calls for deeper investigations of key parameters
that influence the success of such interventions before launching clinical
trials.
