BACKGROUND: Evidence for the association between underlying non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), the risk of testing severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive, and the clinical consequences of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controversial and scarce. We aimed to investigate the 
association between the presence of NAFLD and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity 
and COVID-19-related outcomes.
METHODS: We used the population-based, nationwide cohort in South Korea linked
with the general health examination records between January 1, 2018 and July 30, 
2020. Data for 212,768 adults older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2
testing from January 1 to May 30, 2020, were obtained. The presence of NAFLDs was
defined using three definitions, namely hepatic steatosis index (HSI), fatty
liver index (FLI), and claims-based definition. The outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 test
positive, COVID-19 severe illness, and related death.
RESULTS: Among 74,244 adults who completed the general health examination, there 
were 2,251 (3.0%) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, 438 (0.6%) with severe COVID-19
illness, and 45 (0.06%) COVID-19-related deaths. After exposure-driven propensity
score matching, patients with pre-existing HSI-NAFLD, FLI-NAFLD, or claims-based 
NAFLD had an 11-23% increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HSI-NAFLD 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1-28%; FLI-NAFLD 95% CI, 2-27%; and claims-based NAFLD 
95% CI, 2-31%) and a 35-41% increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (HSI-NAFLD 
95% CI, 8-83%; FLI-NAFLD 95% CI, 5-71%; and claims-based NAFLD 95% CI, 1-92%).
These associations are more evident as liver fibrosis advanced (based on the BARD
scoring system). Similar patterns were observed in several sensitivity analyses
including the full-unmatched cohort.
CONCLUSION: Patients with pre-existing NAFLDs have a higher likelihood of testing
SARS-CoV-2 positive and severe COVID-19 illness; this association was more
evident in patients with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. Our results suggest that
extra attention should be given to the management of patients with NAFLD during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
