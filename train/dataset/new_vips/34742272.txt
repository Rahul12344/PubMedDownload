BACKGROUND: The research aimed to formulate and test a model concerning COVID-19 
perceptions effects on job insecurity and a set of psychosocial factors
comprising anxiety, depression, job burnout and job alienation in the Middle East
and North African (hereafter, MENA) regional context. Also, the study attempted
to examine whether locus of control can moderate these hypothesised linkages
amongst customer service employees working in MENA hospitality organisations.
METHODS: The study is based on a sample of 885 responses to an online survey and 
Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM).
RESULTS: The main findings show the existence of a significant correlation
between COVID perceptions and job insecurity and all psychosocial factors, i.e., 
more intense COVID-19 perceptions accompany higher levels of job insecurity,
anxiety, depression, job burnout and job alienation. Furthermore, our results
revealed that, in pandemic time, hospitality customer service employees with
external locus of control are more likely to suffer higher alienation, anxiety
and depression than those with internal locus of control.
CONCLUSIONS: The research originality centres on the establishment that COVID-19 
has a severe negative impact within the hospitality customer service labour force
(in the MENA region). These effects were more profound for participants who
claimed external locus of control than those with internal locus of control.
