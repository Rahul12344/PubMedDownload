Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can lead to a variety of neurological
disorders. While HEV RNA is known to be present in the central nervous system,
HEV quasispecies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have rarely been
explored. We studied the virus' quasispecies in the blood and the CSF of five
patients at the onset of their neurological symptoms. The samples of three
patients suffering from meningitis, neuralgic amyotrophy and acute inflammatory
polyradiculoneuropathy were taken at the acute phase of the HEV infection. The
samples from the other two patients were taken during the chronic phase (5 years 
after HEV diagnosis) when they presented with clinical signs of encephalitis. We 
sequenced at least 20 randomly polyproline regions of the selected virus clones. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the virus variants in the blood and the CSF revealed no 
virus compartmentalization for the three acute-phase patients but there was clear
evidence of HEV quasispecies compartmentalization in the CSF of the two patients 
during chronic infection. In conclusion, prolonged infection in the
immunocompromised condition can lead to independent virus replication in the
liver and the tissues, producing viruses in CSF.
