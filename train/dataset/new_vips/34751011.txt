BACKGROUND: In Korea, the first community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) occurred in Daegu on February 18, 2020. This study was performed to
investigate the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in healthcare workers (HCWs) at 6 major hospitals in
Daegu.
METHODS: Blood specimens of 2,935 HCWs at 6 major hospitals in Daegu from January
2021 to February 2021 were collected. Every specimen was tested for antibody
against SARS-CoV-2 using both Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and R-FIND COVID-19
IgG/M/A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (SG medical Inc., Seoul, Korea) as 
screening tests. If 1 or more of these screening test results was positive, 2
additional antibody tests were performed using Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay
(Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) and cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody
Detection Kit (GenScript USA Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA). If 2 or more of the
total 4 test results were positive, it was determined as positive for the
antibody against SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: According to the criteria of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity
determination, 12 subjects were determined as positive. The overall positive rate
of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody was 0.41% (12/2,935). Of the 12 subjects determined as
positive, 7 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and the remaining 5 were nondiagnosed
cases of COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: In early 2021, the overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody
among HCW located in Daegu was 0.41%, and 0.17% excluding COVID-19 confirmed
subjects. These results were not particularly high compared with the general
public and were much lower than HCWs in other countries.
