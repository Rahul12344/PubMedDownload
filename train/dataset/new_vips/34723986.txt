OBJECTIVE: To describe the work environment and COVID-19 mitigation measures for 
homeless shelter workers and assess occupational risk factors for COVID-19.
METHODS: Between June 9-August 10, 2020, we conducted a self-administered survey 
among homeless shelter workers in Washington, Massachusetts, Utah, Maryland, and 
Georgia. We calculated frequencies for work environment, personal protective
equipment use, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history. We used generalized linear models 
to produce unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) to assess risk factors for
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
RESULTS: Of the 106 respondents, 43.4% reported frequent close contact with
clients; 75% were worried about work-related SARS-CoV-2 infections; 15% reported 
testing positive. Close contact with clients was associated with testing positive
for SARS-CoV-2 (PR 3.97, 95%CI 1.06, 14.93).
CONCLUSIONS: Homeless shelter workers may be at risk of being exposed to
individuals with COVID-19 during the course of their work. Frequent close contact
with clients was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Protecting these critical 
essential workers by implementing mitigation measures and prioritizing for
COVID-19 vaccination is imperative during the pandemic.
