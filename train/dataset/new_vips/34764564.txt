With the outbreak of COVID-19, medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT)
based diagnosis is proved to be an effective way to fight against the rapid
spread of the virus. Therefore, it is important to study computerized models for 
infectious detection based on CT imaging. New deep learning-based approaches are 
developed for CT assisted diagnosis of COVID-19. However, most of the current
studies are based on a small size dataset of COVID-19 CT images as there are less
publicly available datasets for patient privacy reasons. As a result, the
performance of deep learning-based detection models needs to be improved based on
a small size dataset. In this paper, a stacked autoencoder detector model is
proposed to greatly improve the performance of the detection models such as
precision rate and recall rate. Firstly, four autoencoders are constructed as the
first four layers of the whole stacked autoencoder detector model being developed
to extract better features of CT images. Secondly, the four autoencoders are
cascaded together and connected to the dense layer and the softmax classifier to 
constitute the model. Finally, a new classification loss function is constructed 
by superimposing reconstruction loss to enhance the detection accuracy of the
model. The experiment results show that our model is performed well on a small
size COVID-2019 CT image dataset. Our model achieves the average accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score rate of 94.7%, 96.54%, 94.1%, and 94.8%,
respectively. The results reflect the ability of our model in discriminating
COVID-19 images which might help radiologists in the diagnosis of suspected
COVID-19 patients.
