This contribution explores in a new statistical perspective the antibody
responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 141 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients exhibiting a broad range of clinical
manifestations. This cohort accurately reflects the characteristics of the first 
wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy. We determined the IgM, IgA, and IgG
levels towards SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, and NP antigens, evaluating their neutralizing 
activity and relationship with clinical signatures. Moreover, we longitudinally
followed 72 patients up to 9 months postsymptoms onset to study the persistence
of the levels of antibodies. Our results showed that the majority of COVID-19
patients developed an early virus-specific antibody response. The magnitude and
the neutralizing properties of the response were heterogeneous regardless of the 
severity of the disease. Antibody levels dropped over time, even though spike
reactive IgG and IgA were still detectable up to 9 months. Early baseline
antibody levels were key drivers of the subsequent antibody production and the
long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we identified anti-S1
IgA as a good surrogate marker to predict the clinical course of COVID-19.
Characterizing the antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for
the early clinical management of patients as soon as they are diagnosed and for
implementing the current vaccination strategies.
