The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared an Ebola virus disease (EVD) 
outbreak in North Kivu in August 2018. By June 2019, the outbreak had spread to
26 health zones in northeastern DRC, causing >2,000 reported cases and >1,000
deaths. On June 10, 2019, three members of a Congolese family with EVD-like
symptoms traveled to western Uganda's Kasese District to seek medical care.
Shortly thereafter, the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Surveillance and Laboratory
Program (VHF program) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed
that all three patients had EVD. The Ugandan Ministry of Health declared an
outbreak of EVD in Uganda's Kasese District, notified the World Health
Organization, and initiated a rapid response to contain the outbreak. As part of 
this response, UVRI and the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, with the support of Uganda's Public Health Emergency Operations
Center, the Kasese District Health Team, the Superintendent of Bwera General
Hospital, the United States Department of Defense's Makerere University Walter
Reed Project, and the United States Mission to Kampala's Global Health Security
Technical Working Group, jointly established an Ebola Field Laboratory in Kasese 
District at Bwera General Hospital, proximal to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU).
The laboratory consisted of a rapid containment kit for viral inactivation of
patient specimens and a GeneXpert Instrument for performing Xpert Ebola assays.
Laboratory staff tested 76 specimens from alert and suspect cases of EVD; the
majority were admitted to the ETU (89.3%) and reported recent travel to the DRC
(58.9%). Although no EVD cases were detected by the field laboratory, it played
an important role in patient management and epidemiological surveillance by
providing diagnostic results in <3 hours. The integration of the field laboratory
into Uganda's National VHF Program also enabled patient specimens to be referred 
to Entebbe for confirmatory EBOV testing and testing for other hemorrhagic fever 
viruses that circulate in Uganda.
