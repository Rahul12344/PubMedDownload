OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the distribution of M2 macrophage and
Treg in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) tumor tissue samples. The presence of
these two groups of cells was further correlated to clinical stage, tumor size,
the lymphatic node involvement, and metastasis.
METHODS: The total of 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NPC tissue
samples was collected retrospectively (27 samples) and prospectively (23
samples). Samples were FFPE tissue slices. Immunohistochemistry was done on the
FFPE tissue slides using anti-CD-163 and anti-FoxP-3 antibodies for M2 macrophage
and Treg detection, respectively. The M2 macrophage interpretation was performed 
by eye-balling method and the score was divided into 0 (negative), 1 (scant), 2
(focal), and 3 (abundant). The average number of Treg FOXP3+ cells in 5 high
power fields (HPF) was calculated. The relationship of M2 macrophage and Treg was
tested with Spearman's correlation. The relationship between M2 macrophage and
Treg with clinical stage, tumor size, node involvement and metastasis was tested 
by chi square, with p<0.1.
RESULTS: M2 macrophage and Treg were positive correlated (r=0.469, p<0.001). The 
presence of M2 macrophage and regulatory T cell (Treg) was significantly
correlated to tumor size (p= 0.091 for M2 macrophage and p=0.022 for Treg) and
clinical stage (p= 0.030 for M2 macrophage and p= 0.002 for Treg), but did not
correlate with lymphatic node involvement and metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: In Epstein-Barr virus related NPC tumor microenvironment, the
presence of M2 macrophage was correlated with Treg, and both types of the cells
were correlated with tumor size and clinical stages.
