Two ranavirus isolates were recovered during a wildlife disease investigation in 
California in 1996. Preliminary testing at the time of sample collection
indicated that the two isolates were identical. Phylogenetic analysis of the full
genomes of these two isolates revealed that they are a single strain of frog
virus 3.
