BACKGROUND: The frequency and clinical profile of respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV)-acute respiratory disease (ARD) in older adults in Japan has not been
well-characterized.
METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective observational cohort study to
evaluate the occurrence rate of ARD in 1000 older adult participants (≥65 years) 
for 52 weeks during the 2019 to 2020 season. A multiplex polymerase chain
reaction panel was used for pathogen detection in nasopharyngeal swab from
participants diagnosed with ARD. Symptoms and impact of ARD was assessed using
the Respiratory Infection Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (RiiQ™). The study
was registered at UMIN (https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/): UMIN000037891.
RESULTS: RSV-ARD was detected in 24/1000 (2.4%) participants and RSV-lower
respiratory tract disease in 8/1000 (0.8%) participants. The median duration of
RSV-ARD was 18 days. All 24 participants had utilized the medical services of
outpatient visits and only 1 (4.2%) participant was hospitalized for RSV-ARD. The
most common viruses other than RSV that caused ARD (detected in >10 participants)
were human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza 3, coronavirus OC43, human
metapneumovirus, and influenza A/H1. The most frequent symptoms of RSV-ARD were
cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, and expectoration.
CONCLUSIONS: RSV was reported as a major pathogen for respiratory infections in
older adults in Japan.
