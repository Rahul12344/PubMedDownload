The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated emergency management offices and
organizations across Canada to activate their Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
in a virtual capacity due to government restrictions limiting in-person
activities and with the goal of reducing the spread of the virus. The aim of this
exploratory research paper is to document the personal experiences of Canadian
emergency management professionals working in a Virtual EOC (VEOC) environment
during the COVID-19 response, including challenges and benefits they experienced,
as well as lessons identified. Based on a sample of 81 emergency management
professionals and using an inductive coding approach, the survey results
illustrate both technological and nontechnological challenges and benefits. The
findings highlight the need to incorporate three main elements into VEOC planning
and operations: technology, processes, and people.
