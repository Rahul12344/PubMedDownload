Azvudine (FNC) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV-1 RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp). Recently, we discovered FNC an agent against SARS-CoV-2, and
have taken it into Phase III trial for COVID-19 patients. FNC monophosphate
analog inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 coronavirus with an EC50 between 1.2
and 4.3 μM, depending on viruses or cells, and selective index (SI) in 15-83
range. Oral administration of FNC in rats revealed a substantial thymus-homing
feature, with FNC triphosphate (the active form) concentrated in the thymus and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Treating SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus
macaques with FNC (0.07 mg/kg, qd, orally) reduced viral load, recuperated the
thymus, improved lymphocyte profiles, alleviated inflammation and organ damage,
and lessened ground-glass opacities in chest X-ray. Single-cell sequencing
suggested the promotion of thymus function by FNC. A randomized, single-arm
clinical trial of FNC on compassionate use (n = 31) showed that oral FNC (5 mg,
qd) cured all COVID-19 patients, with 100% viral ribonucleic acid negative
conversion in 3.29 ± 2.22 days (range: 1-9 days) and 100% hospital discharge rate
in 9.00 ± 4.93 days (range: 2-25 days). The side-effect of FNC is minor and
transient dizziness and nausea in 16.12% (5/31) patients. Thus, FNC might cure
COVID-19 through its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity concentrated in the thymus,
followed by promoted immunity.
