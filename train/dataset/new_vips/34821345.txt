Abstract: Our lives and communities have been besieged by COVID-19 for almost two
years, and society and its functioning have been turned upside down and upset,
through limitations and restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Severe levels of anxiety, distress and uncertainty have taken a
huge toll on our daily lives from the social, professional and emotional
perspectives, but it is still rather unclear how serious an impact the emergency 
has had on a class of particularly vulnerable individuals: those with substance
abuse issues. Particularly, we would like to draw attention to a uniquely
troublesome development: forced isolation resulting from pandemic-related
restrictions and how it has impacted drug users and their efforts to achieve
recovery.
