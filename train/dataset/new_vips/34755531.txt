December 1, 2021, is "World AIDS Day," reminding us that HIV infection is still
widespread and that many of its long-term effects can be deadly. One of these
complications is its effect on the pulmonary vascular beds, leading to an
increase in the pulmonary pressure, causing the clinical manifestation of
"pulmonary hypertension." Unfortunately, we are still far from fully
understanding the prevalence, mechanics, and pathobiology of "HIV pulmonary
hypertension," especially in Africa and other developing countries where HIV is
still common. In addition, the impact of other factors like coinfection and
illicit drugs can add and modify the effect on the pulmonary vascular bed,
complicating the pathological and clinical effects of HIV. Thus, "World AIDS Day"
can be an impetus to pursue further research in this area.
