This study sought to clone and sequence the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) gene of the
Fischer's lovebird parrot (Agapornis fischeri). Raw264.7 cells treated with the
expressed IFN-γ protein exhibited an upregulation in inducible nitric oxide
synthase protein expression and nitric oxide (NO) production coupled with
increases in phagocytosis and pinocytosis, as well as an induction of
interferon-stimulated genes through the activation of the NF-κB factor, all of
which are indicators of the innate immune responses of the activated macrophages.
Similar to the IFN-γ protein of other species, the NO production activity of the 
parrot IFN-γ protein decreased by 80% after exposure at 60 °C for 4 min.
Additionally, only half of the NO production activity of the parrot IFN-γ protein
remained upon exposure to HCl for 30 min. These findings suggested that the
parrot IFN-γ protein was heat-labile and sensitive to acidic conditions.
Therefore, all of these effects contributed to the blockage of the uptake of BFDV
virus-like particles (VLPs) by cells, the nuclear entry of the Cap protein of
BFDV VLPs, and the clearance of the virus from BFDV-infected parrots by the IFN-γ
protein of Agapornis fischeri. This study is the first to describe the cloning of
the IFN-γ gene of Agapornis fischeri and characterize the anti-beak and feather
disease virus activity of the IFN-γ protein of Agapornis fischeri.
