COVID-19 poses a significant burden to healthcare systems. Healthcare
organisations with better health innovation infrastructures have faced a reduced 
burden and achieved success in curbing COVID-19. In Saudi Arabia, digital
technologies have played a vital role in fighting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In
this paper, we aimed to summarise the experience of optimising digital health
technologies in Saudi Arabia as well as to discuss capabilities and opportunities
during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. A literature search was conducted up to 
September 2021 to document the experience of using DHTPs in Saudi Arabia in
response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We also considered any published data, press
briefings, and announcements by the MOH in Saudi Arabia. The findings were
synthesised in narrative form. Health officials succeeded in optimising and
maintaining a strategy to mitigate the spread of the virus via different digital 
technologies, such as mobile health applications, artificial intelligence, and
machine learning. The quick digital response in Saudi Arabia was facilitated by
governmental support and by considering users and technology determinants. Future
research must concentrate on establishing and updating the guidelines for using
DHTPs.
