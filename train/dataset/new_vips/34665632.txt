The worldwide proliferation of COVID-19 poses the urgent need for sterilizable
and transparent air filters to inhibit virus transmission while retaining ease of
communication. Here, we introduce copper nanowires to fabricate transparent and
self-sterilizable air filters. Copper nanowire air filter (CNAF) allowed visible 
light penetration, thereby can exhibit facial expressions, helpful for better
communication. CNAF effectively captured particulate matter (PM) by mechanical
and electrostatic filtration mechanisms. The temperature of CNAF could be
controlled by Joule-heating up to 100 Â°C with thermal stability. CNAF
successfully inhibited the growth of E. coli because of the oligodynamic effect
of copper. With heat sterilization, the antibacterial efficiency against G.
anodireducens was greatly improved up to 99.3% within 10 min. CNAF showed high
reusability with stable filtration efficiency and thermal antibacterial efficacy 
after five repeated uses. Our result suggests an alternative form of active
antimicrobial air filter in preparation for the current and future pandemic
situations.
