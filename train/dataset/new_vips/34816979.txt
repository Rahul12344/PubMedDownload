This study aimed to verify socio-demographic and baseline clinical factors
associated with death in a hospital cohort of patients with COVID-19. A
retrospective cohort study was conducted between February and December 2020 in a 
university hospital in the city of São Paulo, using Hospital Epidemiology Center 
data. RT-PCR-positive patients were selected to compose the sample (n = 1,034).
At the end of the study, 362 (32%) patients died. In this cohort, age equal to or
greater than sixty years (HR = 1.49) and liver disease (HR = 1.81) were
independent risk factors for death from COVID-19 associated with higher
in-hospital mortality.
