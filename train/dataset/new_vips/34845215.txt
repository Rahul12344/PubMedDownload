A candidate multigenic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on an MVA vector expressing both 
viral N and S proteins (MVA-S + N) was immunogenic, and induced T-cell responses 
and binding antibodies to both antigens but in the absence of detectable
neutralizing antibodies. Intranasal immunization with the vaccine diminished
viral loads and lung inflammation in mice after SARS-CoV-2 challenge, which
correlated with the T-cell response induced by the vaccine in the lung,
indicating that T-cell immunity is also likely critical for protection against
SARS-CoV-2 infection in addition to neutralizing antibodies.
