BACKGROUND: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been
deployed in India. The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy 
of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic
RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among employees of the 
All India Institute of Medical Sciences (a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi,
India), who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for
SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India
between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases (test-positives) and controls
(test-negatives) were matched (1:1) on the basis of age and gender. The odds of
vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for
level of occupational exposure (to COVID-19), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 
calendar time, using conditional logistic regression. The primary outcome was
effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 (with the second dose received at least 14
days before testing) in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - odds ratio) × 100%.
FINDINGS: Between April 15 and May 15, 2021, 3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test.
Of these, 2714 symptomatic employees had data on vaccination status, and 1068
matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The adjusted
effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered
at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0·0001). The adjusted
effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46%
(95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57% (21-76). 
After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted
effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47%
(95% CI 29-61).
INTERPRETATION: This study shows the effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against
symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge surge in cases, presumably
dominated by the potentially immune-evasive delta (B.1.617.2) variant of
SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the ongoing roll-out of this vaccine to help
control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while continuing the emphasis on adherence to
non-pharmacological measures.
