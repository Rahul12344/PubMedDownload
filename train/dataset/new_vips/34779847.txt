Importance: Antidepressant use may be associated with reduced levels of several
proinflammatory cytokines suggested to be involved with the development of severe
COVID-19. An association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs)-specifically fluoxetine hydrochloride and fluvoxamine
maleate-with decreased mortality among patients with COVID-19 has been reported
in recent studies; however, these studies had limited power due to their small
size.
Objective: To investigate the association of SSRIs with outcomes in patients with
COVID-19 by analyzing electronic health records (EHRs).
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used
propensity score matching by demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and
medication indication to compare SSRI-treated patients with matched control
patients not treated with SSRIs within a large EHR database representing a
diverse population of 83 584 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January to
September 2020 and with a duration of follow-up of as long as 8 months in 87
health care centers across the US.
Exposures: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and specifically (1)
fluoxetine, (2) fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, and (3) other SSRIs (ie, not
fluoxetine or fluvoxamine).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Death.
Results: A total of 3401 adult patients with COVID-19 prescribed SSRIs (2033
women [59.8%]; mean [SD] age, 63.8 [18.1] years) were identified, with 470
receiving fluoxetine only (280 women [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 58.5 [18.1] years), 
481 receiving fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (285 women [59.3%]; mean [SD] age, 58.7
[18.0] years), and 2898 receiving other SSRIs (1733 women [59.8%]; mean [SD] age,
64.7 [18.0] years) within a defined time frame. When compared with matched
untreated control patients, relative risk (RR) of mortality was reduced among
patients prescribed any SSRI (497 of 3401 [14.6%] vs 1130 of 6802 [16.6%]; RR,
0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99]; adjusted P = .03); fluoxetine (46 of 470 [9.8%] vs 937 
of 7050 [13.3%]; RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54-0.97]; adjusted P = .03); and fluoxetine 
or fluvoxamine (48 of 481 [10.0%] vs 956 of 7215 [13.3%]; RR, 0.74 [95% CI,
0.55-0.99]; adjusted P = .04). The association between receiving any SSRI that is
not fluoxetine or fluvoxamine and risk of death was not statistically significant
(447 of 2898 [15.4%] vs 1474 of 8694 [17.0%]; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.00];
adjusted P = .06).
Conclusions and Relevance: These results support evidence that SSRIs may be
associated with reduced severity of COVID-19 reflected in the reduced RR of
mortality. Further research and randomized clinical trials are needed to
elucidate the effect of SSRIs generally, or more specifically of fluoxetine and
fluvoxamine, on the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.
