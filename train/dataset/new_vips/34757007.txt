Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard for
detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This
study tested the performance of a pooled testing strategy for RT-PCR and its
cost-effectiveness. In total, 1280 leftover respiratory samples collected between
19 April and 6 May 2021 were tested in 128 pools of 10 samples each, out of which
16 pools were positive. The positivity rate of the unpooled samples was 1.9%
(24/1280). After parallel testing using the individual and pooled testing
strategies, positive agreement was 100% and negative agreement was 99.8%. The
overall median cycle threshold (Ct) value of the unpooled samples was 29.8
(interquartile range 22.3-34.3). Pools that remained positive when compared with 
the results of individual samples had lower median Ct values compared with those 
that turned out to be negative (28.8 versus 34.8; P=0.0.035). Pooled testing
reduced the cost >4-fold. Pooled testing may be a more cost-effective approach to
diagnose SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited settings without compromising diagnostic 
performance.
