Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, resulting in an estimated 440,571 deaths of children under age 5
annually. Rotavirus, norovirus, and sapovirus are leading causes of childhood
AGE. A successful rotavirus vaccine has reduced rotavirus hospitalizations by
more than 50%. Using rotavirus as a guide, elucidating the determinants, breath, 
and duration of serological antibody immunity to AGE viruses, as well as host
genetic factors that define susceptibility is essential for informing development
of future vaccines and improving current vaccine candidates. Here, we summarize
the current knowledge of disease burden and serological antibody immunity
following natural infection to inform further vaccine development for these three
high-burden viruses.
