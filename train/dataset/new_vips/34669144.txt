BACKGROUND: Data on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with Primary
Antibody Deficiencies (PAD) are limited to infected patients and to heterogeneous
cohorts after immunization.
METHODS: Forty-one patients with Common Variable Immune Deficiencies (CVID), six 
patients with X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and 28 healthy age-matched
controls (HD) were analyzed for anti-Spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)
antibody production, generation of Spike-specific memory B-cells, and
Spike-specific T-cells before vaccination and one week after the second dose of
BNT162b2 vaccine.
RESULTS: The vaccine induced Spike-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in all
HD and in 20% of SARS-CoV-2 naive CVID patients. Anti-Spike IgG were detectable
before vaccination in 4 out 7 CVID previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were
boosted in six out of seven patients by the subsequent immunization raising
higher levels than patients naïve to infection. While HD generated Spike-specific
memory B-cells, and RBD-specific B-cells, CVID generated Spike-specific atypical 
B-cells, while RBD-specific B-cells were undetectable in all patients, indicating
the incapability to generate this new specificity. Specific T-cell responses were
evident in all HD and defective in 30% of CVID. All but one patient with XLA
responded by specific T-cell only.
CONCLUSION: In PAD patients, early atypical immune responses after BNT162b2
immunization occurred, possibly by extra-follicular or incomplete germinal center
reactions. If these responses to vaccination might result in a partial protection
from infection or reinfection is now unknown. Our data suggests that SARS-CoV-2
infection more effectively primes the immune response than the immunization
alone, possibly suggesting the need for a third vaccine dose for patients not
previously infected.
