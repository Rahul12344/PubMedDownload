BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can
recur even after achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR).
Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) is a newly identified
biomarker correlated with liver fibrosis. This study aimed to clarify outcomes
for patients with an SVR and to assess the prognostic value of M2BPGi.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed patients who underwent
surgical resection for primary HCV-related HCC between 2008 and 2018. The study
enrolled 81 patients whose M2BPGi could be evaluated after an SVR. The
relationship between liver fibrosis-related factors and scores (including M2BPGi)
and HCC recurrence, was evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 81 patients, 57 (70.4%) with HCV-related HCC obtained an SVR,
whereas 24 patients (29.6%) did not. The patients with an SVR had a significantly
more favorable recurrence-free survival (RFS) than the patients with no SVR (P < 
0.0001, log-rank). Among the SVR groups, M2BPGi predicted a shorter RFS after
hepatic resection with a higher degree of accuracy than other markers and scores 
in the SVR group. The high-M2BPGi group had worse liver function, RFS, and
overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0014 and 0.0006, log-rank, respectively). In the
multivariate analysis, high M2BPGi was significantly associated with worse RFS
and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Even after achievement of an SVR, the risk of HCC recurrence cannot 
be eliminated. Measurement of M2BPGi after an SVR can be applied for risk
stratification in the assessment of patients with HCV-related HCC.
