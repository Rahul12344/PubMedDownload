Background: Little is known about antibiotic prescribing on hospice admission
despite known risks and limited evidence for potential benefits. Objective: To
describe the frequency and characteristics of patients prescribed antibiotics on 
hospice admission. Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: Adult (age â‰¥18 years)
decedents of a national, for-profit hospice chain across 19 U.S. states who died 
between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Measures: The primary outcome was 
having an antibiotic prescription on hospice admission. Patient characteristics
of interest were demographics, hospice referral location, hospice care location, 
census region, primary diagnosis, and infectious diagnoses on admission. We used 
multivariable logistic regression to quantify associations between study
variables. Results: Among 66,006 hospice decedents, 6080 (9.2%) had an antibiotic
prescription on hospice admission. Fluoroquinolones (22%) were the most
frequently prescribed antibiotic class. Patients more likely to have an
antibiotic prescription on hospice admission included those referred to hospice
care from the hospital (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.00-1.29) compared with an assisted living facility, those receiving
hospice care in a private home (aOR 3.85, 95% CI 3.50-4.24), nursing home (aOR
3.65, 95% CI 3.24-4.11), assisted living facility (aOR 4.04, 95% CI 3.51-4.64),
or hospital (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 2.18-2.71) compared with inpatient hospice, and
those with a primary diagnosis of liver disease (aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.82-2.74) or
human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (aOR
3.89, 95% CI 2.27-6.66) compared with those without these diagnoses. Conclusions:
Approximately 9% of hospice patients had an antibiotic prescription on hospice
admission. Patients referred to hospice from a hospital, those receiving care in 
a noninpatient hospice facility, and those with liver disease or HIV/AIDS were
more likely to have an antibiotic prescription. These results may inform future
antimicrobial stewardship interventions among patients transitioning to hospice
care.
