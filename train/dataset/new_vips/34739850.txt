Antibody transfer via breastmilk represents an evolutionary strategy to boost
immunity in early life. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies have been observed in the breastmilk, the
functional quality of these antibodies remains unclear. Here, we apply systems
serology to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in maternal serum and
breastmilk to compare the functional characteristics of antibodies in these
fluids. Distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are observed in the serum
and breastmilk of lactating individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with
a more dominant transfer of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM into breastmilk.
Although IgGs are present in breastmilk, they are functionally attenuated. We
observe preferential transfer of antibodies capable of eliciting neutrophil
phagocytosis and neutralization compared to other functions, pointing to
selective transfer of certain functional antibodies to breastmilk. These data
highlight the preferential transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgM to
breastmilk, accompanied by select IgG subpopulations, positioned to create a
non-pathologic but protective barrier against coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19).
