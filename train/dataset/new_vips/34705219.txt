BACKGROUND: Early, precise and simultaneous identification of plant viruses is of
great significance for preventing virus spread and reducing losses in
agricultural yields.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, the identification of plant viruses from
symptomatic samples collected from a cigar tobacco planting area in Deyang and a 
flue-cured tobacco planting area in Luzhou city, Sichuan Province, China, was
conducted by deep sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) through an Illumina sequencing
platform, and plant virus-specific contigs were generated based on virus-derived 
siRNA sequences. Additionally, sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis were 
performed to determine the species or strains of these viruses. A total of
27930450, 21537662 and 28194021 clean reads were generated from three pooled
samples, with a total of 105 contigs mapped to the closest plant viruses with
lengths ranging from 34 ~ 1720 nt. The results indicated that the major viruses
were potato virus Y, Chilli veinal mottle virus, tobacco vein banding mosaic
virus, tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus. Subsequently, a fast and
sensitive multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was
developed for the simultaneous detection of the most frequent RNA viruses
infecting cigar and flue-cured tobacco in Sichuan.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a theoretical basis and convenient methods for
the rapid detection and control of viruses in cigar- and flue-cured tobacco.
