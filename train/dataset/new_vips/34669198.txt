Diagnosis of a primary vaginal cancer is rare, as most vaginal tumors are
metastatic from another primary site. Although cancer of the vagina is more
common in postmenopausal women, an increase in young women being diagnosed with
primary vaginal cancer has been reported, especially in countries with a high HIV
prevalence. This is associated with persistence of high-risk HPV infection. The
emphasis should be on primary prevention with prophylactic HPV vaccination. Once 
there is a suspicion of a primary vaginal cancer, this should be confirmed
histologically with biopsy. Staging has been done clinically, as with cervical
cancer; however, there is a role for imaging in assisting with staging as this is
often a difficult assessment. Treatment should be individualized and depends on
stage as well as histologic subtype. It is prudent to refer cases to centers of
excellence with experience in dealing with this rare gynecological cancer.
