Norovirus is the leading cause of sporadic and epidemic acute gastroenteritis
(AGE) in children and adults around the world. We investigated the molecular
diversity of noroviruses in a paediatric population in Senegal between 2007-2010 
prior to rotavirus vaccine implementation. Stool samples were collected from 599 
children under 5 years of age consulting for AGE in a hospital in Dakar.
Specimens were screened for noroviruses using the Allplex™ GI-Virus Assay.
Positive samples were genotyped after sequencing of conventional RT-PCR products.
Noroviruses were detected in 79 (13.2%) of the children, with GII.4 (64%) and
GII.6 (10%) as the most frequently identified genotypes. Our study describes the 
distribution of genotypes between 2007 and 2010 and should be a baseline for
comparison with more contemporary studies. This could help decision makers on
possible choices of norovirus vaccines in the event of future introduction. This
