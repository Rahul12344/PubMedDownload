Background and Objectives: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to
search individual, sociodemographic and environmental predictors of COVID-19
outcomes. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 1036 COVID-19 confirmed 
patients (3-99 years, mean 59 years; 482 females) who sought treatment at the
emergency units of the public health system of Diadema (Brazil; March-October
2020) was included. Primary data were collected from medical records: sex, age,
occupation/education, onset of symptoms, presence of chronic diseases/treatment
and outcome (death and non-death). Secondary socioeconomic and environmental data
were provided by the Department of Health. Results: The mean time spent between
COVID-19 symptom onset and admission to the health system was 7.4 days. Principal
component analysis summarized secondary sociodemographic data, and a Poisson
regression model showed that the time between symptom onset and health system
admission was higher for younger people and those from the least advantaged
regions (availability of electricity, a sewage network, a water supply and
garbage collection). A multiple logistic regression model showed an association
of age (OR = 1.08; 1.05-1.1), diabetes (OR = 1.9; 1.1-3.4) and obesity (OR = 2.9;
1.1-7.6) with death outcome, while hypertension and sex showed no significant
association. Conclusion: The identification of vulnerable groups may help the
development of health strategies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
