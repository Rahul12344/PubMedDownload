SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having devastating consequences worldwide. Although
vaccination advances at good pace, effectiveness against emerging variants is
unpredictable. The virus has displayed a remarkable resistance to treatments and 
no drugs have been proved fully effective against COVID-19. Thus, despite the
international efforts, there is still an urgent need for new potent and safe
antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we exploited the enormous potential of plant
metabolism using the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha L. and identified a potent
SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, following a bioactivity-guided fractionation and
mass-spectrometry approach. We found that the chlorophyll derivative Pheophorbide
a (PheoA), a porphyrin compound similar to animal Protoporphyrin IX, has an
extraordinary antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, preventing infection of
cultured monkey and human cells, without noticeable cytotoxicity. We also show
that PheoA targets the viral particle, interfering with its infectivity in a
dose- and time-dependent manner. Besides SARS-CoV-2, PheoA also displayed a
broad-spectrum antiviral activity against enveloped RNA viral pathogens such as
HCV, West Nile, and other coronaviruses. Our results indicate that PheoA displays
a remarkable potency and a satisfactory therapeutic index, which together with
its previous use in photoactivable cancer therapy in humans, suggest that it may 
be considered as a potential candidate for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
