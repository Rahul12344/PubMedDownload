OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated body mass index (BMI) and weight changes in
people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1; PLWH) initiated on
single-tablet darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide
(DRV/c/FTC/TAF) or bictegravir/FTC/TAF (BIC/FTC/TAF).
METHODS: Electronic medical records (EMR) data for treatment-naïve or
virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 who initiated treatment with
DRV/c/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF (index date) were obtained from Decision Resources
Group's EMR (7/17/2017-3/1/2020). Inverse probability of treatment weighting was 
used to account for differences in baseline characteristics between the two
cohorts. BMI and weight changes from pre-index to 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
following the index date were compared using weighted mean differences (MDs). The
time until an increase in BMI or weight ≥5% or ≥10% was compared using weighted
hazard ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: The weighted DRV/c/FTC/TAF and BIC/FTC/TAF cohorts comprised 1,116 and
1,134 PLWH, respectively (mean age=∼49 years, females: ∼28%). Larger increases in
BMI and weight from pre-index to each post-index time points were observed in
PLWH initiating BIC/FTC/TAF vs DRV/c/FTC/TAF (12 months: MD in BMI =1.23 kg/m2,
p < 0.001; MD in weight =2.84 kg [6.26 lbs], p = 0.008). PLWH receiving
BIC/FTC/TAF were significantly more likely to experience weight gain ≥5% (HR
=1.76, p = 0.004) and ≥10% (HR =2.01, p = 0.020) and BMI increase ≥5% (HR =1.77, 
p = 0.004) and ≥10% (HR =1.76, p = 0.044) than those receiving DRV/c/FTC/TAF.
CONCLUSIONS: BIC/FTC/TAF was associated with greater BMI and weight increases
compared to DRV/c/FTC/TAF. Weight gain and its sequelae may add to the clinical
burden of PLWH and should be considered among other factors when selecting
antiretroviral single-tablet regimens.
