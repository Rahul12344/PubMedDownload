Cell-type-specific, activity-dependent electrophysiology can allow in-depth
analysis of functional connectivity inside complex neural circuits composed of
various cell types. To date, optics-based fluorescence recording devices enable
monitoring cell-type-specific activities. However, the monitoring is typically
limited to a single brain region, and the temporal resolution is significantly
low. Herein, a multimodal multi-shank fluorescence neural probe that allows
cell-type-specific electrophysiology from multiple deep-brain regions at a high
spatiotemporal resolution is presented. A photodiode and an electrode-array pair 
are monolithically integrated on each tip of a minimal-form-factor silicon
device. Both fluorescence and electrical signals are successfully measured
simultaneously in GCaMP6f expressing mice, and the cell type from sorted neural
spikes is identified. The probe's capability of combined electro-optical
recordings for cell-type-specific electrophysiology at multiple brain regions
within a neural circuit is demonstrated. The new experimental paradigm to enable 
the precise investigation of functional connectivity inside and across complex
neural circuits composed of various cell types is expected.
