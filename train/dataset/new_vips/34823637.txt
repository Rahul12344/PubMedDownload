We assessed the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in Italy, by estimating numbers of
averted COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths between
January and September 2021, by age group and geographical macro areas. Timing and
speed of vaccination programme implementation varied slightly between
geographical areas, particularly for older adults. We estimated that 445,193 (17%
of expected; range: 331,059-616,054) cases, 79,152 (32%; range: 53,209-148,756)
hospitalisations, 9,839 ICU admissions (29%; range: 6,434-16,276) and 22,067
(38%; range: 13,571-48,026) deaths were prevented by vaccination.
