Poultry contact is a risk factor for zoonotic transmission of non-typhoidal
Salmonella spp. Salmonella illness outbreaks in the United States are identified 
by PulseNet, the national laboratory network for enteric disease surveillance.
During 2020, PulseNet observed a 25% decline in the number of Salmonella clinical
isolates uploaded by state and local health departments. However, 1722
outbreak-associated Salmonella illnesses resulting from 12 Salmonella serotypes
were linked to contact with privately owned poultry, an increase from all
previous years. This report highlights the need for continued efforts to prevent 
backyard poultry-associated outbreaks of Salmonella as ownership increases in the
United States.
