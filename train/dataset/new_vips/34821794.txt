Theobroma cacao is affected by viruses on every continent where the crop is
cultivated, with the most well-known ones belonging to the Badnavirus genus. One 
of these, cacao mild mosaic virus (CaMMV), is present in the Americas, and is
transmitted by several species of Pseudococcidae (mealybugs). To determine which 
species are associated with virus-affected cacao plants in North America, and to 
assess their potential as vectors, mealybugs (n = 166) were collected from
infected trees in Florida, and identified using COI, ITS2, and 28S markers. The
species present were Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi (38%; n = 63), Maconellicoccus
hirsutus (34.3%; n = 57), Pseudococcus comstocki (15.7%; n = 26), and Ferrisia
virgata (12%; n = 20). Virus acquisition was assessed by testing mealybug DNA
(0.8 ng) using a nested PCR that amplified a 500 bp fragment of the movement
protein-coat protein region of CaMMV. Virus sequences were obtained from 34.6 to 
43.1% of the insects tested; however, acquisition did not differ among species,
X2 (3, N = 166) = 0.56, p < 0.91. This study identified two new mealybug species,
P. jackbeardsleyi and M. hirsutus, as potential vectors of CaMMV. This
information is essential for understanding the infection cycle of CaMMV and
developing effective management strategies.
