Quercetin is a naturally occurring phytochemical with good bioactivity, which
mainly exists in the form of glycoside in vegetables, fruits, tea, and wine and
exhibits beneficial health effects. Quercetin is a dietary polyphenol that exerts
the protective effects through diet or use as a food supplement. Compared with
chemical agents, quercetin is widely available and safe. Quercetin has been
extensively studied for its anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, anti-Alzheimer's
disease, anti-arthritic, anti-influenza virus, anti-microbial infection,
anti-aging, autophagy-regulating, and cardiovascular protective effects. Studies 
on its activities against different can-cer cell lines have also been reported
recently. However, the poor water solubility, rapid in vivo metabolism, and short
half-life of quercetin have led to its low bioavailability, thus limiting its
application in the field of medicine. Quercetin nanoparticles and nanoparticle
drug delivery system have been effectively utilized for enhancing its
bioavailability. This paper reviewed the therapeutic potential of quercetin from 
both preclinical and clinical aspects and proposed solutions to improve its
bioavailability, so as to provide a reference for the therapeutic application of 
natural compounds in the field of medicine.
