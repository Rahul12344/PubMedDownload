A 21-year-old man presented with an acute onset of bilateral throbbing headache, 
left ear pain, tinnitus, and fever. There was no skin rash on his face. Otoscopy 
revealed hyperemia and exudate over the left tympanic membrane. The swab culture 
of the exudate grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient 
was diagnosed as acute otitis media. Hearing loss and ipsilateral facial
paralysis developed on hospital day 4. Despite the absence of typical bullous
lesions, serology testing and polymerase chain reaction of the otic exudate for
varicella-zoster virus were positive. The patient was finally diagnosed as zoster
sine herpete.
