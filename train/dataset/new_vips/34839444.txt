Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), caused by fowl adenovirus serotype 4
(FAdV-4), has spread on chicken farms worldwide, causing huge economic losses.
Currently, the exact mechanism of pathogenesis of FAdV-4 remains unknown. Despite
the severe inflammatory damage observed in chickens infected with pathogenic
FAdV-4, few studies have focused on the host immune system-virus interactions and
cytokine secretion. Host immunity acts as one of the most robust defense
mechanisms against infection by pathogens, and cytokines are important in their
elimination. However, excessive inflammatory cytokine secretion could contribute 
to the pathogenesis of FAdV-4. Understanding of the roles of cytokines produced
during FAdV-4 infection is important for the study of pathogenicity and for
developing strategies to control FAdV-4. Several previous studies have addressed 
the immune responses to FAdV-4 infection, but there has not been a systematic
review of this work. The present review provides a detailed summary of the
current findings on cytokine production induced by FAdV-4 infection to accelerate
our understanding of FAdV-4 pathogenesis.
