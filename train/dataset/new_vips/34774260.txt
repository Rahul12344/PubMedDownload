Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spread globally and brought health
and socioeconomic issues. Jakarta tried to accommodate health and economic
interests through the Large-Scale Social Restriction (LSSR) policy that should be
assessed. This study aims to (1) visualize the spatial patterns of confirmed
Covid-19 cases and the locations of potential risk of transmission, and (2)
determine the spatial processes underlying the spatial patterns of Covid-19
cases. The emerging hot spot analysis and space-time scan statistic were employed
to analyze the dynamic of infected cases and transmission risk. A Geographical
Weighted Regression (GWR) model was developed to define factors that influence
the spatial transmission. The result shows that spatial transmission keeps
continuing, despite a decline in the aggregate pandemic curve during LSSR
implementation. This was likely affected by settlements types and population
density distribution, and transportation networks. Spatial analysis supports the 
aggregate pandemic curve to increase the pandemic surveillance effectiveness.
