Acute healthcare services are extremely important, particularly during the
COVID-19 pandemic, as healthcare demand has rapidly intensified, and resources
have become insufficient. Studies on specific prepandemic hospitalization and
emergency department visit (EDV) trends in proximity to death are limited. We
examined time-trend specificities based on sex, age, and cause of death in the
last 2 years of life. Datasets containing all hospitalizations and EDVs of
elderly residents in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy (N = 411,812), who died between
2002 and 2014 at ≥ 65 years, have been collected. We performed subgroup
change-point analysis of monthly trends in the 2 years preceding death according 
to sex, age at death (65-74, 75-84, 85-94, and ≥ 95 years), and main cause of
death (cancer, cardiovascular, or respiratory disease). The proportion of
decedents (N = 142,834) accessing acute healthcare services increased
exponentially in proximity to death (hospitalizations = 4.7, EDVs = 3.9 months
before death). This was inversely related to age, with changes among the youngest
and eldest decedents at 6.6 and 3.5 months for hospitalizations and at 4.6 and
3.3 months for EDVs, respectively. Healthcare use among cancer patients
intensified earlier in life (hospitalizations = 6.8, EDVs = 5.8 months before
death). Decedents from respiratory diseases were most likely to access
hospital-based services during the last month of life. No sex-based differences
were found. The greater use of acute healthcare services among younger decedents 
and cancer patients suggests that policies potentiating primary care support
targeting these at-risk groups may reduce pressure on hospital-based services.
