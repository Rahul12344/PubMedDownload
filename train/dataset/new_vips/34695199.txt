Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive neoplasm
immunophenotypically resembling regulatory T cells, associated with human T-cell 
leukemia virus type-1. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 150 ATL
cases to reveal the overarching landscape of genetic alterations in ATL. We
discovered frequent (33%) loss-of-function alterations preferentially targeting
the CIC long isoform, which were overlooked by previous exome-centric studies of 
various cancer types. Long but not short isoform-specific inactivation of Cic
selectively increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in vivo. We also found recurrent
(13%) 3'-truncations of REL, which induce transcriptional upregulation and
generate gain-of-function proteins. More importantly, REL truncations are also
common in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, especially in germinal center
B-cell-like subtype (12%). In the non-coding genome, we identified recurrent
mutations in regulatory elements, particularly splice sites, of several driver
genes. In addition, we characterized the different mutational processes operative
in clustered hypermutation sites within and outside immunoglobulin/T-cell
receptor genes and identified the mutational enrichment at the binding sites of
host and viral transcription factors suggesting their activities in ATL. By
combining the analyses for coding and non-coding mutations, structural
variations, and copy number alterations, we discovered 56 recurrently altered
driver genes, including 11 novel ones. Finally, ATL cases were classified into
two molecular groups with distinct clinical and genetic characteristics based on 
the driver alteration profile. Our findings not only help to improve diagnostic
and therapeutic strategies in ATL, but also provide insights into T-cell biology 
and have implications for genome-wide cancer driver discovery.
