Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging and circulating in many places 
across the world. Rapid detection of these variants is essential since their
dissemination can impact transmission rates, diagnostic procedures, disease
severity, response to vaccines or patient management. Sanger sequencing has been 
used as the preferred approach for variant detection among circulating human
immunodeficiency and measles virus genotypes. Using primers to amplify a fragment
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encoding part of the Spike protein, we showed that
Sanger sequencing allowed us to rapidly detect the introduction and spread of
three distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants in two major Brazilian cities. In both cities,
after the predominance of variants closely related to the virus first identified 
in China, the emergence of the P.2 variant was quickly followed by the detection 
of the P1 variant, which became dominant in less than one month after it was
first detected.
