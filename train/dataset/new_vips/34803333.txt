Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the
antiviral activity of Propolis Sulabiroin-A to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus with 
quercetin, hesperidin, and remdesivir as control ligands. The parameters
calculated were docking score and binding energy/molecular mechanics-generalized 
born surface area (MMGBSA), root mean square displacement (RMSD), and root mean
square fluctuation (RMSF). Docking and MMGBSA scores showed that all the ligands 
demonstrate an excellent candidate as an inhibitor, and the order of both scores 
is hesperidin, remdesivir, quercetin, and sulabiroin-A. The molecular dynamics
simulation showed that all the ligands are good candidates as inhibitors.
Although the fluctuation of Sulabiroin-A is relatively high, it has less
protein-ligand interaction time than other ligands. Overall, there is still a
good possibility that sulabiroin-A can be used as an alternative inhibitor if a
new structure of receptor SARS-CoV-2 is used.
