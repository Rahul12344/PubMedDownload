BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the major
causes of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
and it is associated with a significant risk of developing lymphoproliferative
disorders. The rate of clinical disease progression is variable depending on
multiple host and viral factors, including immune response.
METHODS: To perform a comprehensive epitope mapping of anti-HCV antibodies in
patients suffering from HCV-related liver or lymphoproliferative diseases, we
analyzed clinical samples on a peptide microarray platform made of 5952
overlapping 15-mer synthetic peptides derived from the whole HCV proteome. We
evaluated the antibody profile of 71 HCV-positive patients diagnosed with HCC,
mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), and HCV chronic infection. Antibody reactivity
against virus peptides was detected in all HCV-positive patients. Importantly,
the signal amplitude varied significantly within and between diverse patient
groups.
RESULTS: Antibody reactivity against C peptides were found generally low in HCV
chronically infected asymptomatic subjects and increasingly high in HCC and MC
patients. Moreover, we found a statistically significant higher IgG response in
HCC and MC patients against specific domains of HCV C, E2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A,
and p7 compared to HCV-positive subjects.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggest that immune response against specific
HCV protein domains may represent useful biomarkers of disease progression among 
HCV-positive patients and suggest that peptide microarrays are good tools for the
screening of immunotherapy targets in preclinical HCV research.
