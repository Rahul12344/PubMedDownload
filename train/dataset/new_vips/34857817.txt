Although vaccination may precipitate relapses of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in
children with idiopathic NS, no data are available regarding NS activity
regarding influenza (flu) virus infections and NS relapses after receiving
inactivated flu vaccines. We conducted a nationwide study of children aged
6 months to 15 years with idiopathic NS to assess the relationship between NS
relapse, flu vaccination, and flu infections. We used a multivariate Poisson
regression model (MPRM) to calculate the risk ratio (RR) for flu infection and
for NS relapse in children with and without flu vaccination. Data of 306 children
were assessed. The MPRM in all 306 children showed a significantly lower RR for
flu infection (RR: 0.21, 95% confidence interval CI 0.11-0.38) and for NS relapse
(RR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.14-0.35) in children receiving flu vaccination compared with 
unvaccinated children. In an additional MPRM only among 102 children receiving
flu vaccination, they had a significantly lower risk for NS relapse during the
post-vaccination period (RR: 0.31. 95% CI 017-0.56) compared with the
pre-vaccination period. Although our study was observational, based on the
favorable results of flu vaccinations regarding flu infections and NS relapse,
the vaccine may be recommended for children with NS.
