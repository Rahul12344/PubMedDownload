Rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are
useful for rapid diagnosis in a variety of settings. Although many kinds of RATs 
are available, their respective sensitivity has not been compared. Here, we
examined the sensitivity of 27 RATs available in Japan for the detection of the
SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. All of the RATs tested detected the delta variant
albeit with different sensitivities. Nine RATs (ESPLINE SARS-CoV-2, ALSONIC
COVID-19 Ag, COVID-19 and Influenza A+B Antigen Combo Rapid Test, ImmunoArrow
SARS-CoV-2, Fuji Dri-chem immuno AG cartridge COVID-19 Ag, 2019-nCoV Ag rapid
detection kit, Saliva SARS-CoV-2(2019-nCoV) Antigen Test Kit, and Rabliss
SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection kit COVID19 AG) showed superior sensitivity to the
isolated delta variant. Although actual clinical specimens were not examined, the
detection level of most of the RATs was 7500 pfu, indicating that individuals
whose test samples contained less virus than that would be considered negative.
Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that RATs may miss individuals
shedding low levels of infectious virus.
