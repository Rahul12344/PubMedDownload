Metabolic derangement is characteristic in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection. Aside from established liver injury, various extrahepatic metabolic
disorders impact the natural history of the disease, clinical outcomes, and the
efficacy of antiviral therapy. The presence of steatosis, recently redefined as
metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), is a common feature in
HCV-infected patients, induced by host and/or viral factors. Most chronic
HCV-infected (CHC) patients have mild steatosis within the periportal region of
the liver with an estimated prevalence of 40% to 86%. Indeed, this is higher than
the 19% to 50% prevalence observed in patients with other chronic liver diseases 
such as chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The histological manifestations of HCV
infection are frequently observed in genotype 3 (G-3), where relative to other
genotypes, the prevalence and severity of steatosis is also increased. Steatosis 
may independently influence the treatment efficacy of either interferon-based or 
interferon-free antiviral regimens. This review aimed to provide updated evidence
of the prevalence and risk factors behind HCV-associated steatosis, as well as
explore the impact of steatosis on HCV-related outcomes.
