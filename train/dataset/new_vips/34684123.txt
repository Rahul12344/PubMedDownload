Background: A significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged
symptoms, known as Long COVID. The most frequent symptoms are fatigue and
cognitive dysfunction. We describe a patient suffering from Long COVID in whom
adrenal involvement was highlighted. Methods: The patient described Long COVID
symptoms that persist 3 months after the negativization of the molecular swab
test. The main symptoms were weakness, brain fog, dizziness, and muscular and
joint pain. All routine lab panels for inflammation, anemia, and thyroid and
liver function were conducted. Moreover, salivary cortisol and DHEA-S
determinations were used to compute the adrenal stress index (ASI). Results: All 
tests were negative, except the ASI that showed very low levels of free cortisol.
The patient started hydrocortisone acetate supplementation. Conclusion: Long
COVID symptoms could be explained by an adrenal involvement, due to a COVID-19
action on adrenal glands and by a iatrogenic side effect of high glucocorticoid
therapy during the COVID-19 infection. Salivary cortisol determination is
effective for establishing a correct recovery plan.
