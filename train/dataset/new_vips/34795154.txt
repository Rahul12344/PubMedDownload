We previously reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A (1b, Con1) protein
accepts covalent ISG15 conjugation at specific lysine (Lys) residues (K44, K68,
K166, K215 and K308), exhibiting proviral effects on HCV RNA replication. Here we
investigated a role of NS5A-ISGylation via Lys residues in HCV propagation using 
HCV infectious clone. The alignment of amino acid sequences revealed that 5 Lys
residues (K20, K26, K44, K139, and K166) of the 13 Lys residues within NS5A
(genotype 2a, JFH1 strain) were conserved compared to those of HCV (genotype 1b, 
Con1 strain). The cell-based ISGylation assay revealed that the K26 residue in
the amphipathic helix (AH) domain and the K139 residue in domain I of NS5A (2a,
JFH1) had the potential to accept ISGylation. Use of the HCV replicon carrying
luciferase gene revealed that the K26 residue but not K139 residue of NS5A (2a,
JFH1) was important for HCV RNA replication. Furthermore, cell culture HCV
revealed that the mutation with the K26 residue in combination with K139 or K166 
on NS5A (2a, JFH1) resulted in complete abolishment of viral propagation,
suggesting that the K26 residue collaborates with either the K139 residue or K166
residue for efficient HCV propagation. Taken together, these results suggest that
HCV NS5A protein has the potential to accept ISGylation via specific Lys
residues, involving efficient viral propagation in a genotype-specific manner.
