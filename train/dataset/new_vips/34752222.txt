Despite a large volume of research in prevention, central line-associated
bloodstream infections and catheter-related bloodstream infections continue to
cause significant morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs.
Strategies in prevention, including decision about catheter placement, insertion 
bundles, adherence to standard of care guidelines, and technologic innovations,
shown to decrease rates of catheter-related bloodstream infections and central
line-associated bloodstream infections are described in this update. The
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in increased health care-acquired 
infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections.
