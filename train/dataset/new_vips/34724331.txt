Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly contagious virus that causes
multi-systemic, sub-clinical to fatal diseases in a wide range of carnivore
species. Based on the sequences of the haemagglutinin (H) gene, CDV strains have 
been classified into 18 major genetic lineages. In this study, we characterized
the genomes of CDV isolated from the lungs of two dead red pandas in China.
Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed damage due to viral
infection in these lungs. The two strains showed a deep genetic distance from the
other 18 recognized lineages (>4.6% at nucleotide level and >5.0% at amino acid
level). The maximum clade credibility tree of the H- gene sequences showed that
they belonged to an independent clade and had diverged a relatively long time ago
from the Asia-4 lineage (since 1884). These results suggest that the analyzed
strains belong to a new CDV lineage, which we designate as Asia-6. Our finding
indicates that CDV infections in wildlife in China are complex and are a threat
to endangered carnivores.
