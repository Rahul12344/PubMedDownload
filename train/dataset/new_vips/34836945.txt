The success of many viruses depends upon cooperative interactions between viral
genomes. However, whenever cooperation occurs, there is the potential for
'cheats' to exploit that cooperation. We suggest that: (1) the biology of viruses
makes viral cooperation particularly susceptible to cheating; (2) cheats are
common across a wide range of viruses, including viral entities that are already 
well studied, such as defective interfering genomes, and satellite viruses.
Consequently, the evolutionary theory of cheating could help us understand and
manipulate viral dynamics, while viruses also offer new opportunities to study
the evolution of cheating.
