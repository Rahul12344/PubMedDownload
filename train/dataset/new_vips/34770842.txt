Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the world's most prevalent chronic viral infection.
More than 350 million individuals are chronic carriers of the virus, with an
estimated 2 billion infected persons. For instance, the role of HBx protein in
attachment and infection is very obvious and consequently deemed as an important 
druggable target. Targeting the interface and discovering novel drugs greatly
advanced the field of therapeutics development. Therefore, in the current study, 
HBx to Bcl-xL is abrogated on high-affinity carbon nanotubes using computational 
structural biology tools. Our analysis revealed that among the total 62 carbon
fullerenes, only 13 compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against HBx, which
was further confirmed through IFD-based rescoring. Structural dynamics
investigation revealed stable binding, compactness, and hydrogen bonds
reprogramming. Moreover, the binding free energy calculation results revealed
that the top hits1-4 possess the total binding energy of -54.36 kcal/mol (hit1), 
-50.81 kcal/mol (hit2), -47.09 kcal/mol (hit3), and -45.59 kcal/mol for hit4. In 
addition, the predicted KD values and bioactivity scores further validated the
inhibitory potential of these top hits. The identified compounds need further in 
vitro and in vivo validation to aid the treatment process of HBV.
