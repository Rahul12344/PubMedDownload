BX795 is a TANK binding kinase-1 inhibitor that has shown excellent therapeutic
activity in murine models of genital and ocular herpes infections on topical
delivery. Currently, only the BX795 free base and its hydrochloride salt are
available commercially. Here, we evaluate the ability of various organic acids
suitable for vaginal and/or ocular delivery to form BX795
salts/cocrystals/co-amorphous systems with the aim of facilitating pharmaceutical
development of BX795. We characterized BX795-organic acid coevaporates using
powder X-ray diffractometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
Raman spectroscopy, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to elucidate the
interaction between BX795 and various organic acids such as taurine, maleic acid,
fumaric acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid. Furthermore, using human corneal
epithelial cells and HeLa cells, we evaluated BX795-organic acid coevaporates for
in vitro cytocompatibility and in vitro antiviral activity against herpes simplex
virus-type 1 (HSV-1) and type-2 (HSV-2). Our studies indicate that BX795 forms
co-amorphous systems with tartaric acid and citric acid. Interestingly, the
association of organic acids with BX795 improved its thermal stability. Our in
vitro cytocompatibility and in vitro antiviral studies to screen suitable
BX795-organic acid coevaporates for further development show that all
BX795-organic acid systems, at a concentration equivalent to 10 ÂµM BX795,
retained antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 but showed differential
cytocompatibility. Further, dose-dependent in vitro cytocompatibility and
antiviral activity studies on the BX795-fumaric acid system, BX795-tartaric acid 
co-amorphous system, and BX795-citric acid co-amorphous system show similar
antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 compared to BX795, whereas only the
BX795-citric acid co-amorphous system showed higher in vitro cytocompatibility
compared to BX795.
