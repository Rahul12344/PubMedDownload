BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To characterize health care use and costs among new
Medicaid enrollees before and during the COVID pandemic. Results can help
Medicaid non-expansion states understand health care use and costs of new
enrollees in a period of enrollment growth.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of North Carolina
Medicaid claims data (January 1, 2018 - August 31, 2020). We used modified
Poisson and ordinary least squares regression analysis to estimate health care
use and costs as a function of personal characteristics and enrollment during
COVID. Using data on existing enrollees before and during COVID, we projected the
extent to which changes in outcomes among new enrollees during COVID were
pandemic-related.
SUBJECTS: 340,782 new enrollees pre-COVID (January 2018 - December 2019) and
56,428 new enrollees during COVID (March 2020 - June 2020).
MEASURES: We observed new enrollees for 60-days after enrollment to identify
emergency department (ED) visits, nonemergent ED visits, primary care visits,
potentially-avoidable hospitalizations, dental visits, and health care costs.
RESULTS: New Medicaid enrollees during COVID were less likely to have an ED visit
(-46 % [95 % CI: -48 %, -43 %]), nonemergent ED visit (-52 % [95 % CI: -56 %,
-48 %]), potentially-avoidable hospitalization (-52 % [95 % CI: -60 %, -43 %]),
primary care visit (-34 % [95 % CI: -36 %, -33 %]), or dental visit (-36 % [95 % 
CI: -41 %, -30 %]). They were also less likely to incur any health care costs
(-29 % [95 % CI: -30 %, -28 %]), and their total costs were 8 % lower [95 % CI:
-12 %, -4 %]. Depending on the outcome, COVID explained between 34 % and 100 % of
these reductions.
CONCLUSIONS: New Medicaid enrollees during COVID used significantly less care
than new enrollees pre-COVID. Most of the reduction stems from pandemic-related
changes in supply and demand, but the profile of new enrollees before versus
during COVID also differed.
