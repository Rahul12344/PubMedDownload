The COVID-19 pandemic creates a worldwide threat to human health, medical
practitioners, social structures, and finance sectors. The coronavirus epidemic
has a significant impact on people's health, survival, employment, and financial 
crises; while also having noticeable harmful effects on our environment in a
short span of time. In this context, the complexity of the Corona Virus
transmission is estimated and analyzed by the measure of non-linearity called the
Generalized Fractal Dimensions (GFD) on the chest X-Ray images. Grayscale image
is considered as the most important suitable tool in the medical image
processing. Particularly, COVID-19 affects the human lungs vigorously within a
few days. It is a very challenging task to differentiate the COVID-19 infections 
from the various respiratory diseases represented in this study. The multifractal
dimension measure is calculated for the original, noisy and denoised images to
estimate the robustness of COVID-19 and other noticeable diseases. Also the
comparison of COVID-19 X-Ray images is performed graphically with the images of
healthy and other diseases to state the level of complexity of diseases in terms 
of GFD curves. In addition, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used to evaluate the performance of the
denoising process involved in the proposed comparative analysis of the
representative grayscale images.
