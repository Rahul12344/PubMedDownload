Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has compelled the scientific community to search for
an effective drug that can cure or a vaccine that can prevent the disease.
Alternatively, symptomatic treatment and traditional immunity boosters are
prescribed. Holy Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) has been known as an ancient remedy for
cure of common cold and respiratory ailment. Several reports have come on virtual
screening of phytochemicals including those of Tulsi against various enzymes of
the virus. We undertook in silico analysis of the ethanol extracted
phytochemicals of Tulsi as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) main protease
with an approach to look into the possibility of covalent ligand binding with the
catalytic residue Cys145, which makes the report unique. The results suggest that
the flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds of Tulsi, have potential to covalently 
bind to the catalytic residue Cys145 of main protease and irreversibly inhibit
the viral enzyme. Luteolin-7-O-glucuronide is specially considered for its
optimum properties, namely, low toxicity (LD50 5000 mg/kg body weight), high
drug-likeness score (0.71), the active site binding free energy (ΔGbind)
-19.19 kcal/mol by GBSA method and covalent binding energy -24.23 kcal/mol.
Further experimental validations are required to establish the theoretical
findings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
