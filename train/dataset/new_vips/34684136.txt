Background and Objectives: In Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is
caused by the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the clinical manifestations are primarily related to the pulmonary 
system. Under 10% of cases also develop gastrointestinal events such as diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Materials and Methods: We conducted an
observational, retrospective study in the Infectious Diseases Clinic of "Victor
Babes" Hospital, Timis County, in order to assess the incidence, outcome and risk
factors for clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in COVID-19 patients. Results: 
Out of 2065 COVID-19 cases, hospitalized between 1st September 2020 and 30th
April 2021, 40 cases of CDI were identified with 32 cases of hospital-onset of
CDI and eight cases of community-onset and healthcare-associated CDI. By
randomization, polymerase chain reaction ribotyping of Clostridium Difficile was 
performed in six cases. All the randomized cases tested positive for ribotype
027. The percentage of cases recovered with complications at discharge was higher
among COVID-19 patients and CDI (p = 0.001). The in-hospital stay, 36 days versus
28 days, was longer among COVID-19 patients and CDI (p = 0.01). The presence of
previous hospitalization (p = 0.004) and administration of antibiotics during the
hospital stay, increased the risk of CDI among COVID-19 patients. The mean
adjusted CCI at admission was lower among controls (p = 0.01). In two cases,
exitus was strictly CDI-related, with one case positive for 027 ribotype.
Conclusions: CDI has complicated the outcome of COVID-19 patients, especially for
those with comorbidities or previously exposed to the healthcare system. In the
face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread, extensive use of antibiotics,
clinicians should remain vigilant for possible CDI and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.
