African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating haemorrhagic disease of domestic pigs,
which can cause mortality up to 100%. Sudden mortality in pigs following an acute
course of systemic disease was investigated in Mizoram state of India and
confirmed the outbreak as ASF. Affected pigs suffered from severe depression,
high fever, bloody diarrhoea, cutaneous haemorrhages and showed haemorrhagic
lesions in visceral organs. The outbreak was confirmed by detection of p72, p54
and the central variable region of B602L genes by PCR in representative tissue
samples collected from dead pigs. The nucleotide and phylogenetic analyses of
p72, p54 and B602L characterized the ASFV as genotype II. Interestingly, the
analysis of B602L gene has revealed that the ASFV from Mizoram state of India is 
more closely linked to the Eurasian ASFV strains isolated prior to 2014 and
discriminated the Indian strains in two separate groups indicating that the
source of origin for the Mizoram outbreak could be different from that of the
other states of India.
