In this study, we present the complete, annotated genome of a new member of the
Tequatrovirus (T4-like) genus, Escherichia phage vB_EcoM_C2-3. This phage has an 
isometric head (92 nm in diameter) and a contractile tail (114 nm in length). Its
genome consists of a linear, double-stranded DNA of 167,069bp with an average G+C
content of 35.3%. There are 267 predicted genes, of which 125 encode functional
proteins, including those for DNA replication, transcription and packaging, phage
morphogenesis and cell lysis. Neither genes involved in the regulation of
lysogeny nor antibiotic resistance genes were identified. Based on our results,
its genomic features provide valuable insights into the use of a potential
biocontrol agent, as Escherichia phage vB_EcoM_C2-3 exhibited lytic activity
against E. coli, including multidrug-resistant strains.
