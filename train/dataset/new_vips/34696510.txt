Infections with viruses in the genus Flavivirus are a worldwide public health
problem. These enveloped, positive sense single stranded RNA viruses use a small 
complement of only 10 encoded proteins and the RNA genome itself to remodel host 
cells to achieve conditions favoring viral replication. A consequence of the
limited viral armamentarium is that each protein exerts multiple cellular
effects, in addition to any direct role in viral replication. The viruses encode 
four non-structural (NS) small transmembrane proteins (NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B)
which collectively remain rather poorly characterized. NS4A is a 16kDa membrane
associated protein and recent studies have shown that this protein plays multiple
roles, including in membrane remodeling, antagonism of the host cell interferon
response, and in the induction of autophagy, in addition to playing a role in
viral replication. Perhaps most importantly, NS4A has been implicated as playing 
a critical role in fetal developmental defects seen as a consequence of Zika
virus infection during pregnancy. This review provides a comprehensive overview
of the multiple roles of this small but pivotal protein in mediating the
pathobiology of flaviviral infections.
