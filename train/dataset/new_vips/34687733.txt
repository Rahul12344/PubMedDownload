Despite demonstrated efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19), widespread hesitancy to vaccination persists. Improved
knowledge regarding frequency, severity, and duration of vaccine-associated
symptoms may help reduce hesitancy. In this prospective observational study, we
studied 1032 healthcare workers who received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and completed post-vaccine symptom surveys both after
dose 1 and after dose 2. We defined appreciable post-vaccine symptoms as those of
at least moderate severity and lasting at least 2 days. We found that symptoms
were more frequent following the second vaccine dose than the first (74% vs. 60%,
P < 0.001), with >80% of all symptoms resolving within 2 days. The most common
symptom was injection site pain, followed by fatigue and malaise. Overall, 20% of
participants experienced appreciable symptoms after dose 1 and 30% after dose 2. 
In multivariable analyses, female sex was associated with greater odds of
appreciable symptoms after both dose 1 (OR, 95% CI 1.73, 1.19-2.51) and dose 2
(1.76, 1.28-2.42). Prior COVID-19 was also associated with appreciable symptoms
following dose 1, while younger age and history of hypertension were associated
with appreciable symptoms after dose 2. We conclude that most post-vaccine
symptoms are reportedly mild and last <2 days. Appreciable post-vaccine symptoms 
are associated with female sex, prior COVID-19, younger age, and hypertension.
This information can aid clinicians in advising patients on the safety and
expected symptomatology associated with vaccination.
