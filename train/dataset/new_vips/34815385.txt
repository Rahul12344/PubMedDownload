Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed noncoding RNAs, are widely expressed 
in eukaryotes and viruses. They can function by regulating target gene
expression, linear RNA transcription and protein generation. The phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway plays key roles in many biological and
cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, growth, invasion, migration, and 
angiogenesis. It also plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. Emerging data
suggest that the circRNA/PI3K/AKT axis modulates the expression of
cancer-associated genes and thus regulates tumor progression. Aberrant regulation
of the expression of circRNAs in the circRNA/PI3K/AKT axis is significantly
associated with clinicopathological characteristics and plays an important role
in the regulation of biological functions. In this review, we summarized the
expression and biological functions of PI3K-AKT-related circRNAs in vitro and in 
vivo and assessed their associations with clinicopathological characteristics. We
also further discussed the important role of circRNAs in the diagnosis,
prognostication, and treatment of cancers.
