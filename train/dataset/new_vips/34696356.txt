In the present study, we evaluated the effect of spray-drying formulations and
operating parameters of a laboratory-scale spray-dryer on the characteristics of 
spray-dried powders containing two Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages
exhibiting different morphotypes: a podovirus (LUZ19) and a myovirus (14-1). We
optimized the production process for bacteriophage-loaded powders, with an
emphasis on long-term storage under ICH (international conference on
harmonization) conditions. D-trehalose-/L-isoleucine-containing bacteriophage
mixtures were spray-dried from aqueous solutions using a Büchi Mini Spray-dryer
B-290 (Flawil, Switzerland). A response surface methodology was used for the
optimization of the spray-drying process, with the following as-evaluated
parameters: Inlet temperature, spray gas flow rate, and the
D-trehalose/L-isoleucine ratio. The dried powders were characterized in terms of 
yield, residual moisture content, and bacteriophage lytic activity. L-isoleucine 
has demonstrated a positive impact on the activity of LUZ19, but a negative
impact on 14-1. We observed a negligible impact of the inlet temperature and a
positive correlation of the spray gas flow rate with bacteriophage activity.
After optimization, we were able to obtain dry powder preparations of both
bacteriophages, which were stable for a minimum of one year under different ICH
storage conditions (up to and including 40 °C and 75% relative humidity).
