Li A, Moore K, Bowthorpe L, Sousa J, Guan TH.

An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with no definitive
source and potential exposure to variants of concern was declared at a childcare 
center in Ontario, Canada, in March 2021. We developed a robust outbreak
management approach to detect, contain, and interrupt this outbreak and limit
propagation among children.
