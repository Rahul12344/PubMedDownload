Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease (CAEBV) is characterized by high 
levels of EBV predominantly in T and/or NK cells with lymphoproliferation, organ 
failure due to infiltration of tissues with virus-infected cells, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and/or lymphoma. The disease is more common in Asia
than in the United States and Europe. While allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) is considered the only curative therapy for CAEBV, its
efficacy and the best treatment modality to reduce disease severity prior to HSCT
is unknown. Here, we retrospectively assessed an international cohort of 57
patients outside of Asia. Treatment for the disease varied widely, although most 
patients ultimately proceeded to HSCT. Though patients undergoing HSCT had better
survival than those who did not (55% v 25%, p<0.01), there was still a high rate 
of death in both groups. Mortality was largely not affected by age, ethnicity,
cell type involvement, or disease complications, but development of lymphoma
showed a trend with increased mortality (56% v 35%, p=0.1). The overwhelming
majority (75%) of patients who died after HSCT succumbed to relapsed disease.
CAEBV remains challenging to treat when advanced disease is present. Outcomes
would likely improve with better disease control strategies, earlier referral for
HSCT, and close follow-up after HSCT including aggressive management of rising
EBV DNA levels in the blood.
