Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with direct-acting 
antivirals (DAAs) are still at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
after sustained virologic response (SVR). This study aimed to investigate the
role of diabetes mellitus (DM) as a potential predictive risk factor in
developing de novo HCC in HCV-infected patients after DAA treatment. Methods:
This study was registered on PROSPERO under registration number CRD42021230457.
We performed a systematic search in four medical databases from inception through
November 3rd, 2020. Studies were eligible if they reported on HCV-infected
patients treated with DAAs and compared the frequency of de novo HCC in patients 
with and without DM. We calculated pooled odds ratios, unadjusted (UHR), and
adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in
meta-analysis. Results: We included 30 articles in our systematic review and
meta-analysis. DM proved to be a significant risk factor of HCC in DAA-treated
HCV patients in unadjusted (UHR = 1.44, CI: 1.15-1.79) and adjusted analyses (AHR
= 1.31, CI: 1.06-1.62). In the group of patients achieving SVR after DAA therapy,
DM increased the risk of HCC in unadjusted (UHR = 1.3, CI: 1.09-1.51) analysis;
however, in adjusted results, the risk was non-significant (AHR = 1.07, CI:
0.89-1.28). In patients with advanced liver fibrosis, DM was a risk factor for
HCC in adjusted (AHR = 1.36, CI: 1.03-1.8), but not in unadjusted analysis (UHR =
1.11, CI: 0.8-1.42). Conclusions: DM is an independent risk factor of de novo HCC
after DAA treatment in HCV-infected patients. Systematic Review Registration:
