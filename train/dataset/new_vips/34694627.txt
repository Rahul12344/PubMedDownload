The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has increased mortality in countries
worldwide. To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on mortality, the use of excess
mortality rather than reported COVID-19 deaths has been suggested. Excess
mortality, however, requires estimation of mortality under nonpandemic
conditions. Although many methods exist to forecast mortality, they are either
complex to apply, require many sources of information, ignore serial correlation,
and/or are influenced by historical excess mortality. We propose a linear mixed
model that is easy to apply, requires only historical mortality data, allows for 
serial correlation, and down-weighs the influence of historical excess mortality.
Appropriateness of the linear mixed model is evaluated with fit statistics and
forecasting accuracy measures for Belgium and the Netherlands. Unlike the
commonly used 5-year weekly average, the linear mixed model is forecasting the
year-specific mortality, and as a result improves the estimation of excess
mortality for Belgium and the Netherlands.
