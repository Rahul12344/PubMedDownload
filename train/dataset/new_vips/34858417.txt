The development of vaccines against infectious diseases has helped us battle the 
greatest threat to public health. With the emergence of novel viruses, targeted
immunotherapeutics ranging from informed vaccine development to personalized
medicine may be the very thing that separates us between life and death. Late in 
2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), made a remarkable
entrance to human civilization, being one of many to cross the species barrier.
This review discusses the important aspects of COVID-19, providing a brief
overview of our current understanding of dysregulated immune responses developed 
using various experimental models, a brief outline of experimental models of
COVID-19 and more importantly, the rapid development of vaccines
against COVID-19.
