Since its licensing in 1971, the synthetic compound inosine pranobex has been
effectively combating viral infections, including herpes zoster, varicella,
measles, and infections caused by the herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus,
Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory viruses. With the emergence 
of SARS-CoV-2, new and existing drugs have been intensively evaluated for their
potential as COVID-19 medication. Due to its potent immunomodulatory properties, 
inosine pranobex, an orally administered drug with pleiotropic effects, can,
during early treatment, alter the course of the disease. We describe the action
of inosine pranobex in the body and give an overview of existing evidence
collected to support further efforts to study this drug in a rigorous clinical
trial setup.
