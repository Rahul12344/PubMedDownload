Measles virus (MeV) genotype B3 is one globally significant circulating genotype.
Here, we present a systematic description of long-term evolutionary
characterizations of the MeV genotype B3's hemagglutinin (H) gene in the
elimination era. Our results show that the B3 H gene can be divided into two main
sub-genotypes, and the highest intra-genotypic diversity was observed in 2004.
MeV genotype B3's H gene diverged in 1976; its overall nucleotide substitution
rate is estimated to be 5.697 Ã— 10-4 substitutions/site/year, and is slowing
down. The amino acid substitution rate of genotype B3's H gene is also
decreasing, and the mean effective population size has been in a downward trend
since 2000. Selection pressure analysis only recognized a few sites under
positive selection, and the number of positive selection sites is getting
smaller. All of these observations may reveal that genotype B3's H gene is not
under strong selection pressure, and is becoming increasingly conservative. MeV
H-gene or whole-genome sequencing should be routine, so as to better elucidate
the molecular epidemiology of MeV in the future.
