OBJECTIVE: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in clinical, financial, and
mental health outcomes within a diverse sample of hospitalized COVID-19-positive 
patients in the 60 days postdischarge.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2217 adult patients who were hospitalized
with a COVID-19-positive diagnosis as evidenced by test (reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction), a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10 code
U07.1), or strong documented clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but no testing
completed or recorded owing to logistical constraints (n=24).
METHODS: Patient records were abstracted for the Mi-COVID19 data registry,
including the hospital and insurer data of patients discharged from one of 38
participating hospitals in Michigan between March 16, 2020, and July 1, 2020.
Registry data also included patient responses to a brief telephone survey on
postdischarge employment, mental and emotional health, persistence of
COVID-19-related symptoms, and medical follow-up. Descriptive statistics were
used to summarize data; analysis of variance and Pearson chi-squared test were
used to evaluate racial and ethnic variances among patient outcomes and survey
responses.
RESULTS: Black patients experienced the lowest physician follow-up postdischarge 
(n = 65, 60.2%) and the longest delays in returning to work (average 35.5 days). 
More than half of hospital readmissions within the 60 days following discharge
were among nonwhite patients (n = 144, 55%). The majority of postdischarge deaths
were among white patients (n = 153, 21.5%), most of whom were discharged on
palliative care (n = 103). Less than a quarter of patients discharged back to
assisted living, skilled nursing facilities, or subacute rehabilitation
facilities remained at those locations in the 60 days following discharge (n =
48).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Increased attention to postdischarge care
coordination is critical to reducing negative health outcomes following a
COVID-19-related hospitalization.
