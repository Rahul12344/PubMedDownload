OBJECTIVE: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated no effect on the
treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to answer questions
related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for pre-exposure or post-exposure
prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the treatment of patients with mild
COVID-19 in terms of hospitalization, adverse events, and mortality.
METHODS: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 randomized
clinical trials, selected from various databases, which compared patients who
received hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis or treatment of mild
COVID-19 cases with controls.
RESULTS: A total number of 1,376 studies were retrieved. Of those, 9 met the
eligibility criteria and were included in the study. No statistically significant
differences were found between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in terms
of pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of
hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of adverse events by 12% (95% CI, 6-18%; p 
< 0.001), and the number needed to harm was 9. In addition, no significant
differences were found between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups
regarding hospitalization (risk difference [RD] = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.00; p
= 0.14) or mortality (RD = 0.00; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02; p = 0.98) in the
treatment of mild COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2
infection or treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 is not recommended.
