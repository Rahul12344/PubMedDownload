INTRODUCTION: The aim of this project was to evaluate the psychopathological
impact of home confinement and school closing between March and September 2020 on
the mental health of Catalonian children.
METHODS: PEDSAME study: first cross-sectional section (beginning of the school
year) and retrospective data (lockdown), carried out through the network of
Primary Care pediatricians in the Catalan population between 5 and 14 years
(included) from 09/14/2020 to 10/30/2020 in a random sample. Data were collected 
with an online survey through the RedCap platform at the beginning of the school 
year. The main variable was the result of the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire answered by parents to assess the risk of psychopathology, in
addition to other related variable.
RESULTS: The results obtained at the beginning of the school year show that 9.8% 
of the patients were probable cases of psychopathology. The most affected group
were those between 5 and 8 years. The perception of the children's level of
concern for their health and that of their family was a risk factor for
presenting psychopathology, while the good family environment was a protective
factor. Emotional and behavioral symptoms, sleep disorders and problematic use of
screens were detected more frequently during confinement than at the beginning of
the school year.
CONCLUSIONS: Confinement and the absence of schooling for 6 months had a negative
impact on the mental health of the child-adolescent population who showed worse
indicators than the previous year.
