We report the case of a 20-year-old healthy male who developed acute
myopericarditis 2 days after receiving the second dose of the mRNA
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The course of the disease was mild and the
patient was discharged after a few days of hospitalization.Recently, several case
reports involving myopericarditis in patients who received an mRNA vaccine
against SARS-CoV-2 have been published and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the European Medicines Agency pharmacovigilance risk
assessment committee are currently investigating an overall increased number of
cases. They are also assessing whether there is a higher incidence than expected 
in vaccinated young adults and teenagers, especially males. Although a clear
causal link has not been proven at this time, physicians should be aware of such 
potential adverse event, taking into account the increasing number of young
people that will receive mRNA vaccination over the next few months.
