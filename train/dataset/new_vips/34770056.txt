To understand the mental health status of Chinese postgraduate students during
the COVID-19 pandemic, we used three online questionnaires: self-rating anxiety
(SAS) scale, self-rating depression (SDS) scale, and social avoidance and
distress (SAD) scale. A total of 3137 postgraduate students from different
regions of China participated in our study. We explored the relationship between 
participant characteristics and mental health using an analysis of variance
(ANOVA). We found that the proportions of respondents with severe, mild, and
moderate depression were 1.4%, 10.48%, and 21.99%, respectively, and the
corresponding proportions of respondents with anxiety were 1.56%, 4.65%, and
14.69%, respectively. A one-way ANOVA revealed that the mental health statuses of
the participants were different between the subgroups based on majors, classes,
degree types, and the method of communication with advisors and students. A
two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects on interaction and the method of
communication with advisors and peers. These findings suggest that the mental
health of postgraduate students should be monitored during the pandemic,
especially when they are unable to communicate directly with their advisors or
peers, and targeted psychological counselling must be focused on anxiety and
depression.
