This study investigated risk perception of contracting and dying of SARS-CoV-2 in
sub-Sahara Africa during and after the lockdown periods. Two online surveys were 
conducted one year apart, with participants 18 years and above living in
sub-Sahara Africa or the diaspora. Each survey took four weeks. The first survey 
was taken from 18 April to 16 May 2020, i.e., during the lockdown. The second
survey was taken from 14 April to 14 May 2021, i.e., after the lockdown. A
cross-sectional study using adopted and modified questionnaires for both surveys 
were distributed through online platforms. Question about risks perception of
contracting and dying of SARS-CoV-2 were asked. The Helsinki declaration was
applied, and ethical approvals were obtained. Total responses for both surveys,
i.e., both during and after the lockdown, was 4605. The mean age was similar in
both surveys (18-28 years). The mean risk perception scores were higher after
lockdown by 3.59%. Factors associated with risk perception of COVID-19 were
survey period, age group, region of residence, and occupation. Non-health care
workers had a lower risk perception of COVID-19. This first comparative study on 
the level of risk perception of Africans during and after the lockdown shows that
one in every three and every four persons in sub-Sahara Africa felt at high risk 
of contracting COVID-19 and thought they could die from contracting the same,
respectively.
