Overcoming Obstacles in Professional Development During COVID-19.

Davis L, Chappell H.

The unexpected challenges of COVID-19 forced our nation to "rework" normal
practices and routines. Kathy Chappell states that nurse professional development
practitioners must be problem focused and solution oriented. Led by a nurse
professional development specialist, planners employed innovation and creativity 
to address the problems found in one professional development program. This
article assures readers that remote day-long conferences are well accepted and
useful in today's fast-paced learning environment.
