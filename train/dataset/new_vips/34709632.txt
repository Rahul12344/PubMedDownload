Despite the advancement of molecular biology techniques, morphological studies
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are still being of great importance 
to elucidate some aspects of viral structures, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis.
In relation to dengue viruses (DENV), several studies report the use of TEM to
obtain a clearer definition of viral morphology, the events involved in its
morphogenesis, aspects of pathogenesis, and cell tropism. In this chapter, the
main technical protocols and their respective reagents for studies of DENV
infection by TEM are described, both in cell culture and in biological tissue
samples.
