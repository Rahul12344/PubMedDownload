The WRKY transcription factors (TFs) network is composed of WRKY TFs' subset,
which performs a critical role in immunity regulation of plants. However,
functions of WRKY TFs' network remain unclear, particularly in non-model plants
such as pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). This study functionally characterized
CaWRKY30-a member of group III Pepper WRKY protein-for immunity of pepper against
Ralstonia solanacearum infection. The CaWRKY30 was detected in nucleus, and its
transcriptional expression levels were significantly upregulated by R.
solanacearum inoculation (RSI), and foliar application ethylene (ET), abscisic
acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA). Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) of
CaWRKY30 amplified pepper's vulnerability to RSI. Additionally, the silencing of 
CaWRKY30 by VIGS compromised HR-like cell death triggered by RSI and
downregulated defense-associated marker genes, like CaPR1, CaNPR1, CaDEF1,
CaABR1, CaHIR1, and CaWRKY40. Conversely, transient over-expression of CaWRKY30
in pepper leaves instigated HR-like cell death and upregulated defense-related
maker genes. Furthermore, transient over-expression of CaWRKY30 upregulated
transcriptional levels of CaWRKY6, CaWRKY22, CaWRKY27, and CaWRKY40. On the other
hand, transient over-expression of CaWRKY6, CaWRKY22, CaWRKY27, and CaWRKY40
upregulated transcriptional expression levels of CaWRKY30. The results recommend 
that newly characterized CaWRKY30 positively regulates pepper's immunity against 
Ralstonia attack, which is governed by synergistically mediated signaling by
phytohormones like ET, ABA, and SA, and transcriptionally assimilating into WRKY 
TFs networks, consisting of CaWRKY6, CaWRKY22, CaWRKY27, and CaWRKY40.
Collectively, our data will facilitate to explicate the underlying mechanism of
crosstalk between pepper's immunity and response to RSI.
