BACKGROUND AND AIM: After the first Italian case of Covid-19, the Government
imposed the complete closure of all areas involved by the spread of the virus to 
contain transmissions. There was a massive reorganization of Hospitals, a stop of
all elective activities and a convertion of many hospitals in "Covid Centers''.
AITOG (Associazione Italiana Traumatologia e Ortopedia Geriatrica) conducted a
retrospective study on all proximal femur fractures surgeries that occurred in
this period, to find out whether the pandemic and the correlated lockdown somehow
changed the incidence of these events.  Methods: 10 Italian orthopedic centers
were involved in the study. Considering the geographic location, three groups
were created (North, Centre and South). The considered period is the Italian
"Phase 1" (February 23rd - May 3rd 2020).
RESULTS: the cohort is composed of 412 patients, 116 male and 296 female (mean
age 81.1 ± 9.1 years). The same period of 2019 has been used as control group,
with 558 patients, 156 male and 402 female (mean age 84.2 ± 8.0 years). In 2020
we counted 323 (78.4%) fractures occurred at home, 61 (14.8%) in retirement
houses and 28 (6.8%) in different locations. We mainly treated fractures with
intramedullary nails (n.237 57.5%). Among all patients we had 46 (11.1%) Covid-19
positive. The mortality rate within 30 days was of 51 patients (12.4%); 23 of
these died because of complications related to Covid-19 while 31 of  these were
in treatment with anticoagulant/antiaggregant.
CONCLUSIONS: AITOG analysis demonstrates a decrease in surgical interventions for
proximal femur fractures from 2019 to 2020, a reduction in patients mean age and 
an increase in trauma occurred in domestic environment. We also registered a
consistent difference between the North, Center and South of the Country.
