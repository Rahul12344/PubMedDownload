Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of enveloped positive
sense single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause disease to humans. These are
zoonotic having potential to cause large-scale outbreaks of infections widely
causing morbidity and mortality. Papain-Like Proteases (PLpro) is a cysteine
protease, essential for viral replication and proliferation, as a highly
conserved enzyme it cleaves peptide linkage between Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp3, and Nsp4.
As a valid therapeutic targets it stops viral reproduction and boosts host immune
response thereby halting further spread of infection. In the purpose of
identifying inhibitors targeting Papain-Like Proteases (PLpro) we initiated a
high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) protocol using a SuperNatural Database. 
The XP docking results revealed that two compounds SN00334175 and SN00162745
exhibited docking score of -10.58 kcal/mol and -9.93 kcal/mol respectively. The
Further PRIME MMGB-SA studies revealed Van der Waal energy and hydrophobic energy
terms as major contributors for total binding free energy. The 100 ns molecular
dynamics simulation of SN00334175/7JN2 and SN00162745/7JN2 revealed that these
complexes were stabilized with ligand binding forming interactions with Gly266,
Asn267, Tyr268, Tyr273, Thr301 and Asp302, Lys157, Leu162, Asp164, Arg166,
Glu167, Pro248, Tyr264.
