BACKGROUND: To facilitate evidence-based policy-making on safe reopening of
higher education facilities, there is an urgent need to assess baseline profile
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidents within the university/college
settings. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in
universities/colleges in Seoul Metropolitan Area during COVID-19 pandemic period.
METHODS: Among the 38 universities in Seoul, 23 have agreed to participate in the
study. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual-level case
reports submitted to the universities and to the health authorities from February
1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Through the linkage with the Central Disease Control
Headquarters' database, number of secondary infected cases (both within and
outside of the campus) were counted.
RESULTS: Between February 2020 and June 2021, a total of 827 COVID-19 cases were 
confirmed and reported in the universities across Seoul Metropolitan City.
Generally, the community-associated cases had peaks preceding the
university/college-associated. Of those with the documented clinical parameters, 
38.6% of the cases were asymptomatic. Among them, 93% were potentially exposed
off-campus, and 87.7% of the cases had not produced the secondary infection
cases.
CONCLUSION: In the setting of rigorous infection prevention measures in
combination with on- and off- hybrid classes, COVID-19 incidences and outbreaks
were limited in university and college campus area across Seoul Metropolitan
Area. The evidence around the infection preventive measures in higher education
facilities in Seoul Metropolitan Area, suggest insignificant impact on community 
transmission.
