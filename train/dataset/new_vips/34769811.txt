In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed a faceless, non-adversarial threat 
that endangered Israelis and Palestinians with the same ferocity. However, the
capacities of the health systems to address it were not equal, with Israel more
equipped for the outbreak with infrastructure, resources, manpower and later,
vaccines. The pandemic demonstrated the life-saving benefits of cooperation and
the self-defeating harms brought by non-cooperation. These trends are explored
here by an international team of public health and environmental scholars,
including those from different sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This
article explores the importance of recognizing the Israeli and Palestinian
jurisdictions as a single epidemiological unit, and illustrates how doing so is a
pragmatic positioning that can serve self-interest. We demonstrate how despite
political shocks precipitating non-cooperation, there has been a recurrent
tendency towards limited cooperation. The paper concludes with lessons over the
need for reframing public health as a potential bridge, the need for structural
changes creating sustainable platforms for accelerated transboundary cooperation 
to enable the steady management of current and future public and environmental
health crises regardless of dynamic political crises, and the importance of civil
society and international organizations in forging collaboration in advance of
governmental engagement.
