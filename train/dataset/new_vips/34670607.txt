BACKGROUND: During the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Society 
of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force published
recommendations on performance of tracheotomy. Since then, our understanding of
the virus has evolved with ongoing intensive research efforts. New literature has
helped us better understand various aspects including patient outcomes and health
care worker (HCW) risks associated with tracheotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Accordingly, the task force has re-evaluated and revised some of the previous
recommendations.
MAIN BODY: Based on recent evidence, a negative reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 swab status is no longer the main deciding
factor in the timing of tracheotomy. Instead, tracheotomy may be considered as
soon as COVID-19 swab positive patients are greater than 20 days beyond initial
symptoms and 2 weeks of mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, both open and
percutaneous surgical techniques may be considered with both techniques showing
similar safety and outcome profiles. Additional recommendations with discussion
of current evidence are presented.
CONCLUSION: These revised recommendations apply new evidence in optimizing
patient and health care system outcomes as well as minimizing risks of COVID-19
transmission during aerosol-generating tracheotomy procedures. As previously
noted, additional evidence may lead to further evolution of these and other
similar recommendations.
