Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major emerging arboviral disease with a complex
epidemiological cycle. RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted by mosquito vectors to
ruminants, causing epizootics, and then from animals to humans, triggering
epidemics. During its cycle, RVFV infects a wide range of hosts, but the
associated pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated. RVFV displays a predominant
hepatic tropism, but also has a multicellular tropism inducing physiopathological
effects in several tissues. However, there is variability between species in
terms of physiopathology : a common clinical picture is found (severe hepatitis, 
hemorrhages, leukopenia), but certain forms are mainly found in humans
(neurological and ocular damage) or in ruminant herds (waves of abortions).
Although the molecular mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, it seems 
that early inflammatory response is related to the severity of the pathology. A
better understanding of the pathogenesis of RVFV seems essential, especially
since no specific treatment exists to date.
