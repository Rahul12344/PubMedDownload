BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact on
public health services worldwide. Currently, there are no standard remedies or
therapies for COVID-19. it is important to identify and diagnose COVID-19 to
control the spread. But clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to those
of other respiratory viruses.
RESULTS: As a result, the diagnosis of COVID-19 relies heavily on detecting
pathogens. We established a bunch of triplex new TaqMan real-time PCR assays.
Three sets of primers and probes (targeting the ORF1ab, N, and E genes,
respectively) are poorly consistent with other human coronaviruses and the human 
influenza virus. The sensitivity of established PCR assays notices as few as 100 
copies per PCR of the ORF1ab, N, and E genes. Meanwhile, standard curves
concluded from constant PCR reaction all showed glorious linear correlations
between Ct values and the polymer loading copy variety (correlation coefficient
(R2 ) of ORF1ab, N, and E genes is 0.996, 0.991, and 0.998, respectively).
Surveillance of RNA-based pseudovirus demonstrated that they were identified to
be positive with respect to SARS-CoV-2 and that established PCR assays are
achievable.
CONCLUSION: The assays established provide a smaller reaction volume for
diagnosing COVID-19.
