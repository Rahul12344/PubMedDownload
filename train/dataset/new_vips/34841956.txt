HIV Epidemic in Libya: Identifying Gaps.

Hamidi A, Regmi PR, van Teijlingen E.

BACKGROUND: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) became a public issue in Libya after the infection of 
400 children in El-Fatih Hospital in 1988. Due to the civil war, social and
religious barriers, HIV prevalence is hard to establish, but it is generally
believed to be increasing.
OBJECTIVE: This review (a) assesses the size and scope of the available
literature on the HIV epidemic in Libya; and, (b) identifies the nature and
extent of research conducted to date.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed, Medline, Web of
Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Academic Search Ultimate, Cochrane Library and
Google Scholar. Primary research studies and official reports that are
exclusively on Libya published during 1988-2021 were considered.
RESULTS: In total 25 studies were included: Ten primary research studies, four
online news articles, six Government reports, one letter to the editor, one
manuscript, three online databases.
CONCLUSION: Despite the low-quality data, the literature suggests there is an
increase in HIV infection rates in Libya. Culturally sensitive research on sexual
activities, women, HIV preventative methods and attitudes of the Libyan public
will assist in developing an effective National AIDS Programme, reducing HIV
stigma, supporting People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and decreasing infection rates.
