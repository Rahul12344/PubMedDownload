BACKGROUND: Since April 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.167) Delta variant has been
rampant worldwide. Recently, this variant has spread in Guangzhou, China. Our
objective was to characterize the clinical features and risk factors of severe
cases of the Delta variant in Guangzhou.
METHODS: A total of 144 patients with the Delta variant were enrolled, and the
data between the severe and non-severe groups were compared. Logistic regression 
methods and Cox multivariate regression analysis were used to investigate the
risk factors of severe cases.
RESULTS: The severity of the Delta variant was 11.1%. Each 1-year increase in age
(OR, 1.089; 95% CI, 1.035-1.147; P = 0.001) and each 1-μmol/L increase in total
bilirubin (OR, 1.198; 95% CI, 1.021-1.406; P = 0.039) were risk factors for
severe cases. Moreover, the risk of progression to severe cases increased
13.444-fold and 3.922-fold when the age was greater than 58.5 years (HR, 13.444; 
95% CI, 2.989-60.480; P = 0.001) or the total bilirubin level was greater than
7.23 μmol/L (HR, 3.922; 95% CI, 1.260-12.207; P = 0.018), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Older age and elevated total bilirubin were independent risk factors 
for severe cases of the Delta variant in Guangzhou, especially if the age was
greater than 58.5 years or the total bilirubin level was greater than 7.23
μmol/L.
