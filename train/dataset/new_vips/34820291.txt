Mycotoxins are secondary fungi metabolites that induce acute and chronic toxic
effects in humans and animals. In the present study, nine mycotoxins including
aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), fumonisins (FB1 and FB2), Ochratoxin A
(OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), and zearalenone (ZEN) were determined in one hundred
rice samples collected from Tehran using high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) with fluorescence or photodiode array detector. In addition, possible risk
to public health was investigated by assessing dietary exposure through rice
consumption, the margin of exposure (MOE), respective risk of cancer and hazard
index (HI) of the monitored mycotoxins in children and adults. The higher mean
levels were determined for DON (102.22 μg.Kg-1), followed by FB1 (85.00 μg.Kg-1).
For the rests of mycotoxins the levels did not exceed 20 μg.Kg-1. The estimated
AFB1 intake for the adults and children through rice consumption exceeds the safe
levels established for both carriers and non-carriers of hepatitis B virus. The
mean and median determined exposure levels of OTA, DON ZEN and FB1, were found
lower than the Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (PMTDI) value for both 
adults and children of Tehran that consuming domestic and imported rice. The mean
HI for adults and median HI for adults and children were below one, and mean HI
for children was close to one. All the mean, median and maximum MoE values were
<10,000 in adults and children, indicating a risk due to AFB1 exposure through
rice consumption in Tehran. In addition, the calculated mean cancer risk in adult
and child populations of Tehran were 0.27 and 0.64 cases per year per 105
individuals, respectively, that shows population in Tehran could be at risk of
cancer due to AFB1 exposure through rice consumption as calculated. So further
studies are necessary for the monitoring mycotoxins in rice and different food
products as well as estimating average dietary exposure and cumulative exposure
assessment of mycotoxins for main foods in IR Iran.
