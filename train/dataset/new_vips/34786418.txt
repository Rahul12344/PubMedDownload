BACKGROUND: While tuberculosis (TB) itself is a common disease, isolated TB of
the liver is a rare entity. Tubercular involvement of the liver is more commonly 
a part of a disseminated disease of the hepatic parenchyma. In contrast, isolated
hepatic TB spread through the portal vein from the gastrointestinal tract is
seldom encountered in clinical practice, with only a few sporadic cases and short
series available in the current literature. Vascular complications, such as
portal vein thrombosis (PVT), have rarely been reported previously.
CASE SUMMARY: A 22-year-old man was hospitalized with complaints of a 3-mo
history of fever and weight loss of approximately 10 kg. He had a 10-year
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in his medical history. Contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CECT) confirmed hepatosplenomegaly, with hypodensity of the 
right lobe of the liver and 2.1 cm thrombosis of the right branch of the portal
vein. A liver biopsy showed epithelioid granulomas with a background of caseating
necrosis. Ziehl-Nelson staining showed acid-fast bacilli within the granulomas.
The patient was diagnosed with isolated hepatic TB with PVT. Anti-TB therapy
(ATT), including isoniazid, rifapentine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, was
administered. Along with ATT, the patient was treated with entecavir as an
antiviral medication against HBV and dabigatran as an anticoagulant. He remained 
asymptomatic, and follow-up sonography of the abdomen at 4 mo showed complete
resolution of the PVT.
CONCLUSION: Upon diagnosis of hepatic TB associated with PVT and HBV coinfection,
ATT and anticoagulants should be initiated to prevent subsequent portal
hypertension. Antiviral therapy against HBV should also be administered to
prevent severe hepatic injury.
