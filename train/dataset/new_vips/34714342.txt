Importance: Although there are reports of COVID-19 vaccine implementation in
real-world populations, these come from high-income countries or from experience 
with messenger RNA technology vaccines. Data on outcomes of vaccine deployment in
low- or middle-income countries are lacking.
Objective: To assess whether the pragmatic application of the 3 COVID-19 vaccines
available in Argentina, 2 of which have no reports of evaluation in real-world
settings to date, were associated with a reduction in morbidity, all-cause
mortality, and mortality due to COVID-19.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used individual and
ecological data to explore outcomes following vaccination with rAd26-rAd5,
ChAdOx1, and BBIBP-CorV. To correct for differences in exposure times, results
are shown using incidence density per 100 000 person-days from the start of the
vaccination campaign (December 29, 2020) to the occurrence of an event or the end
of follow-up (May 15, 2021). Participants included 663 602 people aged at least
60 years residing in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Statistical analysis
was performed from June 1 to June 15, 2021.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, death from all causes, and death within 
30 days of a diagnosis of COVID-19. Poisson regression models were fitted to
estimate associations with all 3 outcomes.
Results: Among 663 602 residents of the city of Buenos Aires included in the
study, 540 792 (81.4%) were vaccinated with at least 1 dose, with 457 066
receiving 1 dose (mean [SD] age, 74.5 (8.9) years; 61.5% were female
[n = 281 284]; 68.0% [n = 310 987] received the rAd26-rAd5 vaccine; 29.5%
[n = 135 036] received ChAdOx1; 2.4% [n = 11 043] received BBIBP-CorV) and 83 726
receiving 2 doses (mean [SD] age, 73.4 [6.8] years; 63.5% were female
[n = 53 204]). The incidence density of confirmed COVID-19 was 36.25
cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 35.80-36.70 cases/100 000 person-days) among
those who did not receive a vaccine, 19.13 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI,
18.63-19.62 cases/100 000 person-days) among those who received 1 dose, and 4.33 
cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 3.85-4.81 cases/100 000 person-days) among
those who received 2 doses. All-cause mortality was 11.74 cases/100 000
person-days (95% CI, 11.51-11.96 cases/100 000 person-days), 4.01 cases/100 000
person-days (95% CI, 3.78-4.24 cases/100 000 person-days) and 0.40 cases/100 000 
person-days (95% CI, 0.26-0.55 cases/100 000 person-days). COVID-19-related-death
rate was 2.31 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 2.19-2.42 cases/100 000
person-days), 0.59 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 0.50-0.67 cases/100 000
person-days), and 0.04 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 0.0-0.09 cases/100 000 
person-days) among the same groups. A 2-dose vaccination schedule was associated 
with an 88.1% (95% CI, 86.8%-89.2%) reduction in documented infection, 96.6% (95%
CI, 95.3%-97.5%) reduction in all-cause death, and 98.3% (95% CI, 95.3%-99.4%)
reduction in COVID-19-related death. A single dose was associated with a 47.2%
(95% CI, 44.2%-50.1%) reduction in documented infection, 65.8% (95% CI,
61.7%-69.5%) reduction in all-cause death, and 74.5% (95% CI, 66%-80.8%)
reduction in COVID-19-related death.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that within the first 5 months after 
the start of the vaccination campaign, vaccination was associated with a
significant reduction in COVID-19 infection as well as a reduction in mortality.
