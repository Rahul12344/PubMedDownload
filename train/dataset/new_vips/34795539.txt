Background: Viral infections are the most common diseases. Of them, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B viruses (HBV), and hepatitis C viruses 
(HCV) are common. When HBV or HCV becomes co-morbid with HIV, they lead to severe
forms of a disease and rapid death.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and associated
factors of HBV and HCV among HIV-positive study participants.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 81 individuals, and a
non-randomized purposive sampling technique was used. From each study
participant, sociodemographic and clinical data were gathered by using a
pretested questionnaire and data collection sheet, respectively. Further, a
venous blood sample was collected for viral load count, and HBV and HCV
determination. To keep the quality of test results, commercially prepared quality
control samples were used. The data were entered to EPI-Info version 7 and
analyzed by using SPSS version 20. The descriptive data were summarized in
percentages, median, and IQR. Logistic regression was analyzed to determine
associated factors. To say the data were statistically significant, the p-values 
should be less than 0.05.
Results: A total of 81 study participants were included. Of them, 56.8% (46/81)
and 67.9% (55/81) were female and urban residents, respectively. The prevalence
of hepatitis co-infection was 21% (95% CI: 17%, 23%). Further, the prevalence of 
HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV was 13.5% (95% CI: 10.5%, 16.5%) and 8.6% (95% CI: 5.6%,
11.6%), respectively. Wise use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
0.01 (0.00, 0.213) was a preventive factor to hepatitis infection.
Conclusion and Recommendation: The HBV and HCV co-infection among HIV-positive
patients was a significant public health concern. Also, having wise use of HAART 
can reduce exposure to hepatitis co-infection. Therefore, clear strategies on
hepatitis screening and wise use of HAART to HIV would be critical.
