Biological and cellular interleukin-6 (IL-6)-related therapies have been used to 
treat severe COVID-19 pneumonia with hyperinflammatory syndrome and acute
respiratory failure, which prompted further exploration of the role of IL-6 in
human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hUCMSC) therapy. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were responders cocultured with hUCMSCs or exogenous
IL-6. A PBMC suppression assay was used to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects 
via MTT assay. The IL-6 concentration in the supernatant was measured using
ELISA. The correlation between the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCMSCs and IL-6
levels and the relevant roles of IL-6 and IL-6 mRNA expression was analyzed using
the MetaCore functional network constructed from gene microarray data. The
location of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression was further evaluated. We
reported that hUCMSCs did not initially exert any inhibitory effect on
PHA-stimulated proliferation; however, a potent inhibitory effect on
PHA-stimulated proliferation was observed, and the IL-6 concentration reached
approximately 1000 ng/mL after 72 hours. Exogenous 1000 ng/mL IL-6 inhibited
PHA-stimulated inflammation but less so than hUCMSCs. The inhibitory effects of
hUCMSCs on PHA-stimulated PBMCs disappeared after adding an IL-6 neutralizing
antibody or pretreatment with tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6R antagonist. hUCMSCs
exert excellent anti-inflammatory effects by inducing higher IL-6 levels, which
is different from TCZ. High concentration of IL-6 cytokine secretion plays an
important role in the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCMSC therapy. Initial hUCMSC 
therapy, followed by TCZ, seems to optimize the therapeutic potential to treat
COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
