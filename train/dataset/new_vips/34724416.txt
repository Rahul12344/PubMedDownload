We analyzed trends in adult COVID-19 vaccine coverage over time based on COVID-19
vaccine hesitancy and social vulnerability. We found that each of these variables
carries an independent association with disparities across counties in COVID-19
vaccine coverage. Counties that score high on both hesitancy and vulnerability
are especially likely to have lower COVID-19 vaccination rates compared with the 
rest of the country.
