BACKGROUND: Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a co-receptor which is located at the
surface of cells like natural killer, monocytes, T and B cells. It has two
ligands including programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and ligand-2 (PD-L2). T cell 
functions are inhibited by activation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and this pathway is
used by viruses and some tumor cells in order to escape from immune eradication. 
In our study we evaluated PD-L1 expression in the tissue specimens of patients
with Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma and other renal tumors.
METHODS: Totally 60 patients who were followed up at Gazi University Hospital
with the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor and other renal tumors were
included. PD-L1 expression was examined in tumor samples of the patients.
RESULTS: Positive staining with PD-L1 was detected only in two male patients.
Both of them had neuroblastoma and advanced stage disease. None of the patients
with Wilms tumor and other renal tumors had positive PD-L1 staining.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike adult tumors, PD-L1 expression is not common in childhood
tumors due to differences in immune system between children and adults. Further
studies are needed to establish the importance and effects of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
in pediatric tumors.
