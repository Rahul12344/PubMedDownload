The microbicidal activities of mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs)
and food additive grade calcium hydroxide (FdCa(OH)2) were evaluated in a
suspension test at -20°C using an anti-freeze agent (AFA) containing methanol, or
at 1°C, with varying contact time, toward avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV), fowl adenovirus (FAdV), avian reovirus (ARV), Salmonella
Infantis (SI) and Escherichia coli (EC). At -20°C, the mixtures could inactivate 
AIV and NDV within 30 min, FAdV and ARV within 5 sec, and SI and EC within 3 min,
respectively. AFA did not inactivate viruses and bacteria within 30 min and 10
min, respectively. At 1°C, the mixtures inactivated FAdV and ARV within 30 sec,
AIV within 10 min, and NDV within 30 min. A mixture of slaked lime (SL) and QAC
could inactivate FAdV and ARV within 30 sec, but could not inactivate AIV and NDV
even after 60 min at 1°C. SL could not substitute FdCa(OH)2 in order to exert the
synergistic effects with QAC. Thus, QACs microbicidal activities were maintained 
or enhanced by adding FdCa(OH)2. It is hence recommended to use QACs with
FdCa(OH)2, especially in the winter season.
