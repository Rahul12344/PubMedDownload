COVID-19 can manifest with signs and symptoms related to many different systems. 
Therefore, in the examination of almost every patient, COVID-19 infection is
excluded first This may cause other diseases to be missed, as almost occurred in 
the case of a 15-year old boy with brucellosis and a splenic abscess. Public and 
health care personnel fear of COVID-19 may cause more harm than the virus itself.
