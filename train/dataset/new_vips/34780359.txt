Occurrence and recurrence of COVID-19 cases have been observed globally. The
complex relationship of host-pathogen and the environment plays a vital role in
understanding the widespread recurrence of the SARS-CoV-2 among humans. Though
the pathobiology of the disease is not completely understood, it is well
established that COVID-19 poses a greater threat to individuals with
co-morbidities and a weakened immune system. The article deals with the notion of
innate immunity, natural selection, and the survival of the fittest during the
COVID-19 outbreak. The article also attempts to introduce the concept of
"lifestyle and cultural immunity" that needs to be addressed and incorporated at 
an early stage of childhood to boost up the human immune system. The
communication further discusses the role of vaccination and micro-organisms
pre-existing in the environment which are required to enhance the immunity of an 
individual.
