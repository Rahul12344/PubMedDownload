Objective: To explore the correlation between the affinity while donor's HLA type
recognizing different cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen peptide and the occurrence of
CMV infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(allo-HSCT) in children. Methods: To investigate the relationship between CMV
reactivation, CMV infection or CMV related tissue/organ diseases and the
different HLA-type recognition antigen peptide of the donors, we retrospectively 
analyzed the clinical data of 146 children with CMV infection for 6 months since 
from the time they underwent transplantation in Wuhan Children's Hospital.
Results: Among 146 patients, the HLA type of 82 (56.16%) cases had high affinity 
with PP65 alone, and 34 cases of CMV infection occurred after transplantation
(41.46%) . None of 5 cases that had a high affinity with IE-1 alone got CMV
infection. None of 2 cases with no clear high-affinity peptide had CMV infection.
Three of 5 cases that had a high affinity with PP65 and PP50 had CMV infection.
Thirteen of 52 cases that had a high affinity with PP65 and IE-1 had CMV
infection (25.00%) . HLA with exclusive PP50 high affinity was not encountered.
Donors with a high-affinity HLA locus associated with IE-1 showed a lower
incidence of CMV infection after HSCT compared to those carrying only the PP65
high-affinity allele (22.81% vs 41.46%, P=0.029) . Conclusion: HLA type with PP65
and IE-1 high-affinity covers approximately 99.8% of the donors. Stem cells
generated from HLA donors with high affinity with the CMV antigen peptide IE-1
can reduce the risk of post-transplantation CMV-activated infection in children.

Publisher: 目的： 探索儿童异基因造血干细胞移植（allo-HSCT）后供者HLA型别识别不同巨细胞病毒（CMV）抗原肽亲和力与发生CMV感染的相关性。
方法：
回顾性分析武汉儿童医院血液肿瘤科146例allo-HSCT患儿移植后6个月内发生CMV再激活、CMV感染、CMV组织器官病的数据，分析其与供者HLA型别识别CMV
抗原肽差异的相关性。 结果：
纳入研究的146例移植后患儿中HLA型别与PP65单独高亲和力82例（56.16%），移植后发生CMV感染34例（41.46%）；IE-1高亲和力型5例，移植后感
染0例；无明确亲和力多肽2例，感染0例；PP65+IE-1高亲和力型52例，移植后感染13例（25.00%）；与PP65和PP50共同高亲和力型5例，移植后感染3
例；未遇到仅与PP50高亲和力HLA供者。与仅携带PP65高亲和力等位基因组比较，伴有IE-1高亲和力HLA位点供者移植后表现出更低的CMV感染发生率（22.81
%对41.46%，P=0.029）。 结论： CMV
PP65和IE-1高亲和力型别HLA类型覆盖约99.8%的供者，选择CMV抗原肽IE-1高亲和力型别HLA供者或可降低儿童血液病患者allo-HSCT后CMV感染
风险。.
