OBJECTIVES: Patients who arrive at the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19,
who test negative at the first real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
represent a clinical challenge. This study aimed to evaluate if the clinical
manifestation at presentation, the laboratory and imaging results, and the
prognosis of COVID-19 differ in patients who tested negative at the first RT-PCR 
compared with those who tested positive and also to evaluate if comorbid
conditions patient-related or the period of arrival are associated with negative 
testing.
STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively collected clinical data of patients who accessed
the ED from March 1 to May 15, 2020.
METHODS: We compared clinical variables, comorbid conditions, and clinical
outcomes in the two groups by univariate analysis and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Patients who tested negative at the first RT-PCR showed a higher
prevalence of cardiopathy, immunosuppression, and diabetes, as well as a higher
leukocyte and lower lymphocyte counts compared with patients who tested positive.
A bilateral interstitial syndrome and a typical pattern at computed tomography
scan were prevalent in the test-negative group. Test-negative patients were more 
likely to be admitted to the hospital but less likely to need admission in a high
level of care ward. The false-negative rate increased from March to May.
CONCLUSION: False-negative RT-PCR COVID-19 patients present a similar spectrum of
symptoms compared with positive cohort, but more comorbidities. Imaging helps to 
identify them. True positives had a higher risk of serious complications.
