Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) infection is an emergent zoonotic disease, where chronic 
hepatitis E associated to solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, related to
genotype 3, is the clinical manifestation of major concern. In this setting,
ribavirin (RBV) treatment is the only available therapy, though drug-resistant
variants could emerge leading to a therapeutic failure. Crystallographic
structures have not been reported for most of the HEV proteins, including the
RNA-polymerase (RdRp). Therefore, the mechanism of action of RBV against HEV and 
the molecular interactions between this drug and RdRp are largely unknown. In
this work, we aimed to model in silico the 3 D structure of a novel HEV3 RdRp
(HEV_C1_Uy) from a chronically HEV infected-SOT recipient treated with RBV and to
perform a molecular docking simulation between RBV triphosphate (RBVT),
7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate and the modelled protein. The models were
generated using I-TASSER server and validated with multiple bioinformatics tools.
The docking analysis were carried out with AutoDock Vina and LeDock software. We 
obtained a suitable model for HEV_C1_Uy (C-Score=-1.33, RMSD = 10.4 ± 4.6 Å).
RBVT displayed a binding affinity of -7.6 ± 0.2 Kcal/mol by molecular docking,
mediated by 6 hydrogen-bonds (Q195-O14, S198-O11, E257-O13, S260-O2, O3,
S311-O11) between the finger's-palm-domains and a free binding energy of
31.26 ± 16.81 kcal/mol by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified the
possible HEV RdRp interacting region for incoming nucleotides or analogs and
provide novel insights that will contribute to better understand the molecular
interactions of RBV and the enzyme and the mechanism of action of this antiviral 
drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
