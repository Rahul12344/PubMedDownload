BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has the potential to increase healthcare access
especially for vulnerable populations. Telemedicine for Evaluation, Adherence,
and Medication for Hepatitis C (TEAM-C) is comparing telemedicine access to
specialty medical care to usual care for management of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection among persons with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). PWOUD have the highest 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence and incidence, yet they infrequently receive
HCV care. The study objectives are to compare access to specialty care via
telemedicine to offsite specialty referral (usual care) on 1) treatment
initiation, completion, and sustained virological response, 2) patient
satisfaction with health care delivery, and 3) HCV reinfection after successful
HCV cure.
METHODS: TEAM-C is a multi-site, non-blinded, randomized pragmatic clinical trial
conducted at 12 opioid treatment programs (OTP) throughout New York State that
utilizes the stepped-wedge design. The unit of randomization is the OTP with a
total sample size of 624 participants. HCV-infected PWOUD were treated via
telemedicine or referral. Telemedicine encounters are conducted onsite in the OTP
with co-administration of direct acting antivirals for HCV with medications for
opioid use disorder. The primary outcome is undetectable HCV RNA obtained
12 weeks post-treatment cessation. We also follow participants for two years to
assess for reinfection.
CONCLUSIONS: The study utilizes a rigorous study design to evaluate the
effectiveness and implementation of virtual treatment for HCV integrated into
behavioral treatment. We demonstrate the feasibility, engagement principles and
lessons learned from the initial prospective randomized trial of telemedicine
targeted to a vulnerable population.
