Gut viruses are important, yet often neglected, players in the complex human gut 
microbial ecosystem. Recently, the number of human gut virome studies has been
increasing; however, we are still only scratching the surface of the immense
viral diversity. In this study, 254 virus-enriched fecal metagenomes from 204
Danish subjects were used to generate the Danish Enteric Virome Catalog (DEVoC)
containing 12,986 nonredundant viral scaffolds, of which the majority was
previously undescribed, encoding 190,029 viral genes. The DEVoC was used to
compare 91 healthy DEVoC gut viromes from children, adolescents, and adults that 
were used to create the DEVoC. Gut viromes of healthy Danish subjects were
dominated by phages. While most phage genomes (PGs) only occurred in a single
subject, indicating large virome individuality, 39 PGs were present in more than 
10 healthy subjects. Among these 39 PGs, the prevalences of three PGs were
associated with age. To further study the prevalence of these 39 prevalent PGs,
1,880 gut virome data sets of 27 studies from across the world were screened,
revealing several age-, geography-, and disease-related prevalence patterns. Two 
PGs also showed a remarkably high prevalence worldwide-a crAss-like phage (20.6% 
prevalence), belonging to the tentative AlphacrAssvirinae subfamily, and a
previously undescribed circular temperate phage infecting Bacteroides dorei
(14.4% prevalence), called LoVEphage because it encodes lots of viral elements.
Due to the LoVEphage's high prevalence and novelty, public data sets in which the
LoVEphage was detected were de novo assembled, resulting in an additional 18
circular LoVEphage-like genomes (67.9 to 72.4 kb). IMPORTANCE Through generation 
of the DEVoC, we added numerous previously uncharacterized viral genomes and
genes to the ever-increasing worldwide pool of human gut viromes. The DEVoC, the 
largest human gut virome catalog generated from consistently processed fecal
samples, facilitated the analysis of the 91 healthy Danish gut viromes.
Characterizing the biggest cohort of healthy gut viromes from children,
adolescents, and adults to date confirmed the previously established high
interindividual variation in human gut viromes and demonstrated that the effect
of age on the gut virome composition was limited to the prevalence of specific
phage (groups). The identification of a previously undescribed prevalent phage
illustrates the usefulness of developing virome catalogs, and we foresee that the
DEVoC will benefit future analysis of the roles of gut viruses in human health
and disease.
