West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are the two most widespread
mosquito-borne flaviviruses in Europe causing severe neuroinvasive disease in
humans. Here, following standardization of the murine model with wild type (wt)
viruses, we engineered WNV and USUV genome by reverse genetics. A recombinant
virus carrying the 5' UTR of WNV within the USUV genome backbone (r-USUV5'-UTR
WNV) was rescued; when administered to mice this virus did not cause signs or
disease as wt USUV suggesting that 5' UTR of a marked neurotropic parental WNV
was not per se a virulence factor. Interestingly, a chimeric virus carrying the
envelope (E) protein of USUV in the WNV genome backbone (r-WNVE-USUV) showed an
attenuated profile in mice compared to wt WNV but significantly more virulent
than wt USUV. Moreover, except when tested against serum samples originating from
a live WNV infection, r-WNVE-USUV showed an identical antigenic profile to wt
USUV confirming that E is also the major immunodominant protein of USUV.
