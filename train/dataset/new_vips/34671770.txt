Understanding broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus antibody responses is key to
developing countermeasures effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future
spillovers of other sarbecoviruses. Here we describe the isolation and
characterization of a human monoclonal antibody, designated S2K146, broadly
neutralizing viruses belonging to all three sarbecovirus clades known to utilize 
ACE2 as entry receptor and protecting therapeutically against SARS-CoV-2 beta
challenge in hamsters. Structural and functional studies show that most of the
S2K146 epitope residues are shared with the ACE2 binding site and that the
antibody inhibits receptor attachment competitively. Viral passaging experiments 
underscore an unusually high barrier for emergence of escape mutants making it an
ideal candidate for clinical development. These findings unveil a key site of
vulnerability for the development of a next generation of vaccines eliciting
broad sarbecovirus immunity.
