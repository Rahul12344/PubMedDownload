African swine fever virus (ASFV) has become widespread in Europe, Asia and
elsewhere, thereby causing extensive economic losses. The viral genome includes
nearly 200 genes, but their expression within infected pigs has not been well
characterized previously. In this study, four pigs were infected with a genotype 
II strain (ASFV POL/2015/Podlaskie); blood samples were collected before
inoculation and at both 3 and 6 days later. During this period, a range of
clinical signs of infection became apparent in the pigs. From the blood,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. The transcription of
the ASFV genes was determined using RNAseq on poly(A)+ mRNAs isolated from these 
cells. Only very low levels of virus transcription were detected in the PBMCs at 
3 days post-inoculation (dpi) but, at 6 dpi, extensive transcription was
apparent. This was co-incident with a large increase in the level of ASFV DNA
within these cells. The pattern of the virus gene expression was very
reproducible between the individual pigs. Many highly expressed genes have
undefined roles. Surprisingly, some genes with key roles in virus replication
were expressed at only low levels. As the functions of individual genes are
identified, information about their expression becomes important for
understanding their contribution to virus biology.
