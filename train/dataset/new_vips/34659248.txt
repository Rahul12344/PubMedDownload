Type 3 Innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) have been described as tissue-resident cells
and characterized throughout the body, especially in mucosal sites and classical 
first barrier organs such as skin, gut and lungs, among others. A significant
part of the research has focused on their role in combating pathogens, mainly
extracellular pathogens, with the gut as the principal organ. However, some
recent discoveries in the field have unveiled their activity in other organs,
combating intracellular pathogens and as part of the response to viruses. In this
review we have compiled the latest studies on the role of ILC3s and the molecular
mechanisms involved in defending against different microbes at the mucosal
surface, most of these studies have made use of conditional transgenic mice. The 
present review therefore attempts to provide an overview of the function of ILC3s
in infections throughout the body, focusing on their specific activity in
different organs.
