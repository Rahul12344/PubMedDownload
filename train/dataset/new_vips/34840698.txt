Background: At present, the new crown virus is spreading around the world,
causing all people in the world to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
Problem. People with masks have found a lot of trouble for face recognition.
Finding a feasible method to recognize faces wearing masks is a problem that
needs to be solved urgently.
Method: This paper proposes a mask recognition algorithm based on improved
YOLO-V4 neural network and the integrated SE-Net and DenseNet network and
introduces deformable convolution.
Conclusion: Compared with other target detection networks, the improved YOLO-V4
neural network used in this paper improves the accuracy of face recognition and
detection with masks to a certain extent.
