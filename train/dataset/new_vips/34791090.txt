BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are rarely reported to cause outbreaks of diarrhea. We 
describe a foodborne outbreak of microsporidiosis from a workplace canteen in
November 2020 in Denmark.
METHODS: A probable case was defined as any person using the canteen between
November 4 and December 13, 2020, reporting at least one gastrointestinal
symptom, whereas a confirmed case also had an Enterocytozoon bieneusi positive
stool sample. A web-based questionnaire was used to collect clinical,
epidemiological, and food exposure data. We performed a retrospective cohort
study and tested stool samples from affected individuals for bacterial, viral,
and parasitic pathogens, including E. bieneusi.
RESULTS: Altogether, 195 individuals completed the questionnaire. We identified
52 cases (65% male; median age 45 years [range 25 - 65]). Diarrhea (90%), fatigue
(83%), and abdominal pain (79%) were the most commonly reported symptoms. Eight
cases were laboratory-confirmed, and had E. bieneusi genotype C. The incubation
period was between 5 and 12 days, and PCR-detectable spore shedding occurred up
to 43 days after symptom onset. Disease was associated with consuming food from
the workplace canteen on November 4, 2020 (RR, 2.8 [95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.4 - 5.4]) and lunchboxes containing open sandwiches (RR, 3.2 [95% CI 1.4 -
7.2]) served that day.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the second documented foodborne outbreak of E. bieneusi
genotype C-associated diarrhea worldwide. Epidemiological findings advocated an
open sandwiches lunchbox from November 4, 2020, as a likely source. E. bieneusi
may be an under-reported cause of outbreaks of diarrhea, and testing for it might
be useful in foodborne outbreak investigations.
