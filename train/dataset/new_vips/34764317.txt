Rising temperature levels during spring and summer are often argued to enable
lifting of strict containment measures even in the absence of herd immunity.
Despite broad scholarly interest in the relationship between weather and
coronavirus spread, previous studies come to very mixed results. To contribute to
this puzzle, the paper examines the impact of weather on the COVID-19 pandemic
using a unique granular dataset of over 1.2 million daily observations covering
over 3700 counties in nine countries for all seasons of 2020. Our results show
that temperature and wind speed have a robust negative effect on virus spread
after controlling for a range of potential confounding factors. These effects,
however, are substantially larger during mealtimes, as well as in periods of high
mobility and low containment, suggesting an important role for social behaviour.
