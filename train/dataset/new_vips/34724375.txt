Proteins are promising biofunctional units for the construction of nanomaterials 
(NMs) due to their abundant binding sites, intriguing self-assembly properties,
and mild NM synthetic conditions. Tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVCP) is a 
protein capable of self-assembly into distinct morphologies depending on the
solution pH and ionic strength. Herein, we report the use of TMVCP as a building 
block to organize nanosized platinum into discrete nanorings and isolated
nanoparticles by varying the solution pH to modulate the protein assembly state. 
Compared with a commercial Pt/C catalyst, the TMVCP-templated platinum materials 
exhibited significant promotion of the catalytic activity and stability toward
methanol electrooxidation in both neutral and alkaline conditions. The enhanced
catalytic performance is likely facilitated by the protein support. Additionally,
Pt nanorings outperformed isolated nanoparticles, although they are both
synthesized on TMVCP templates. This could be due to the higher mechanical
stability of the protein disk structure and possible cooperative effects between 
adjacent nanoparticles in the ring with narrow interparticle spacing.
