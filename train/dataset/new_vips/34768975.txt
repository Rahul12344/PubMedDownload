Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term encompassing several
neurodevelopmental disorders such as Asperger syndrome or autism. It is
characterised by the occurrence of distinct deficits in social behaviour and
communication and repetitive patterns of behaviour. The symptoms may be of
different intensity and may vary in types. Risk factors for ASD include disturbed
brain homeostasis, genetic predispositions, or inflammation during the prenatal
period caused by viruses or bacteria. The number of diagnosed cases is growing,
but the main cause and mechanism leading to ASD is still uncertain. Recent
findings from animal models and human cases highlight the contribution of glia to
the ASD pathophysiology. It is known that glia cells are not only "gluing"
neurons together but are key players participating in different processes crucial
for proper brain functioning, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis,
inflammation, myelination, proper glutamate processing and many others. Despite
the prerequisites for the involvement of glia in the processes related to the
onset of autism, there are far too little data regarding the engagement of these 
cells in the development of ASD.
