BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups are at increased
risk of COVID-19 infection and adverse outcomes. Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is now available for frontline UK
HCWs; however, demographic/occupational associations with vaccine uptake in this 
cohort are unknown. We sought to establish these associations in a large UK
hospital workforce.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining vaccine
uptake amongst all staff at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. We
examined proportions of vaccinated staff stratified by demographic factors,
occupation, and previous COVID-19 test results (serology/PCR) and used logistic
regression to identify predictors of vaccination status after adjustment for
confounders. We included 19,044 HCWs; 12,278 (64.5%) had received SARS-CoV-2
vaccination. Compared to White HCWs (70.9% vaccinated), a significantly smaller
proportion of ethnic minority HCWs were vaccinated (South Asian, 58.5%; Black,
36.8%; p < 0.001 for both). After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity,
deprivation, occupation, SARS-CoV-2 serology/PCR results, and COVID-19-related
work absences, factors found to be negatively associated with vaccine uptake were
younger age, female sex, increased deprivation, pregnancy, and belonging to any
non-White ethnic group (Black: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.30, 95% CI 0.26-0.34, 
p < 0.001; South Asian: aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.62-0.72, p < 0.001). Those who had
previously had confirmed COVID-19 (by PCR) were less likely to be vaccinated than
those who had tested negative. Limitations include data being from a single
centre, lack of data on staff vaccinated outside the hospital system, and that
staff may have taken up vaccination following data extraction.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic minority HCWs and those from more deprived areas as well as
younger staff and female staff are less likely to take up SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
These findings have major implications for the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
programmes, in HCWs and the wider population, and should inform the national
vaccination programme to prevent the disparities of the pandemic from widening.
