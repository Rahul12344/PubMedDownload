The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), declared by the World Health Organization (WHO)
as a global pandemic, has brought with it changes to the general way of life.
Major sectors of the world industry and economy have been affected and the
Internet of Things (IoT) management and framework is no exception in this regard.
This article provides an up to date survey on how a global pandemic such as
COVID-19 has affected the world of IoT technologies. It looks at the
contributions that IoT and associated sensor technologies have made towards virus
tracing, tracking and spread mitigation. The associated challenges of deployment 
of sensor hardware in the face of a rapidly spreading pandemic have been looked
into as part of this review article. The effects of a global pandemic on the
evolution of IoT architectures and management have also been addressed, leading
to the likely outcomes on future IoT implementations. In general, this article
provides an insight into the advancement of sensor-based E-health towards the
management of global pandemics. It also answers the question of how a global
virus pandemic has shaped the future of IoT networks.
