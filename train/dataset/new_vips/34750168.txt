COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on outcomes in lung cancer leading to later
stage presentation, less curative treatment and higher mortality. This has
amplified the existing problem of late-stage presentation in lung cancer and is a
call to arms for a multifaceted strategy to address this, including public
awareness campaigns to promote healthcare review in patients with persistent
chest symptoms. We report the learning from patient and public insight work from 
across the North of England exploring the barriers to seeking healthcare review
with persistent chest symptoms. Members of the public described how a lack of
importance is placed on the common symptoms of lung cancer and a feeling of being
unworthy of review by healthcare professionals. They would feel motivated to seek
review by dispelling the nihilism of lung cancer and would be able to take action
more easily by removing the logistical hassle in the process. We propose a
four-pillar framework (validation-endorsement-motivation-action) for developing
the content of any public awareness campaigns promoting early diagnosis of lung
cancer based on the findings of this comprehensive insight work. All providers
and commissioners must work together to overcome the perceived and real barriers 
to patients with persistent chest symptoms.
