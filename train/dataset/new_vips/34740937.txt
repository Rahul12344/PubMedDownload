OBJECTIVES: Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on
population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing 
(NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health
concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users.
SETTING AND DESIGN: We obtained data from three leading online health forums:
HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1 January 2020 to 31
May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19
keywords; (2) proportion of forum users making their very first post about
COVID-19; (3) proportion of COVID-19-related posts containing content related to 
physical and mental health comorbidities.
RESULTS: Data from 739 434 posts created by 53 134 unique users were analysed. A 
total of 35 581 posts (4.8%) contained a COVID-19 keyword. Posts discussing
COVID-19 and related comorbid disorders spiked in early March to mid-March around
the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of users 
to post on online health forums for the first time. Over a quarter of
COVID-19-related thread titles mentioned a physical or mental health comorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that it is feasible to characterise the content of
online health forum user posts regarding COVID-19 and measure changes over time. 
The pandemic and corresponding public response has had a significant impact on
posters' queries regarding mental health. Social media data sources such as
online health forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental
health surveillance.
