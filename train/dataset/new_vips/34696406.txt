Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses and can 
cause deadly diseases in animals and humans. Cell entry is the first and
essential step of successful virus infection and can be divided into two ongoing 
steps: cell binding and membrane fusion. Over the past two decades, stimulated by
the global outbreak of SARS-CoV and pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, numerous efforts have
been made in the CoV research. As a result, significant progress has been
achieved in our understanding of the cell entry process. Here, we review the
current knowledge of this essential process, including the viral and host
components involved in cell binding and membrane fusion, molecular mechanisms of 
their interactions, and the sites of virus entry. We highlight the recent
findings of host restriction factors that inhibit CoVs entry. This knowledge not 
only enhances our understanding of the cell entry process, pathogenesis, tissue
tropism, host range, and interspecies-transmission of CoVs but also provides a
theoretical basis to design effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to
control CoVs infection.
