OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to present a conceptual framework about the
misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. For this purpose, discourse
analysis of two of the most common social virtual networks were conducted via a
four step approach as follows: defining the research question and selecting the
content of analysis, gathering information and theory on the context, content
analysis for establishing the themes and patterns and, presenting the results and
drawing conclusions.
RESULTS: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the
easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives
and the poor legal supervision of online content are the main reasons for
misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments and prevention are
the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation. The consequences of
misinformation dissemination include psychosocial, economic, health status,
health system and ethical ones. The most recommended strategies for dealing with 
the issue could be divided into demand and supply-side strategies.
