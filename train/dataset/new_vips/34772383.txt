BACKGROUND: To evaluate the current status of emotional exhaustion and
peritraumatic distress of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the COVID-19 pandemic, and
identify factors associated with their mental health status.
METHODS: An online survey involving 1068 of consented HCWs that included nurses, 
physicians, and public health officers was conducted in May 2020. Descriptive
statistics and multivariate regression analyses were performed on the collected
data.
RESULTS: Although no significant difference in peritraumatic distress was
observed among the surveyed HCWs, the workers' experience of emotional exhaustion
varied according to work characteristics. Respondents who were female, older,
living with a spouse, and/or full-time workers reported higher levels of
emotional exhaustion. Public health officers and other medical personnel who did 
not have direct contact with confirmed patients and full-time workers had a
higher level of peritraumatic distress. Forced involvement in work related to
COVID-19, worry about stigma, worry about becoming infected, and perceived
sufficiency of organizational support negatively predict emotional exhaustion and
peritraumatic distress.
CONCLUSIONS: Job-related and emotional stress of HCWs should not be neglected.
Evidence-based interventions and supports are required to protect HCWs from
mental illness and to promote mental health of those involved in the response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
