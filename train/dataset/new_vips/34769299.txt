The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a serious threat to
global public health and the economy. The enzymatic product of cholesterol
25-hydroxylase (CH25H), 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), was reported to have
potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here, we found that the combination of 25-HC
with EK1 peptide, a pan-coronavirus (CoV) fusion inhibitor, showed a synergistic 
antiviral activity. We then used the method of 25-HC modification to design and
synthesize a series of 25-HC-modified peptides and found that a 25-HC-modified
EK1 peptide (EK1P4HC) was highly effective against infections caused by
SARS-CoV-2, its variants of concern (VOCs), and other human CoVs, such as
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. EK1P4HC could protect newborn mice from lethal HCoV-OC43
infection, suggesting that conjugation of 25-HC with a peptide-based viral
inhibitor was a feasible and universal strategy to improve its antiviral
activity.
