INTRODUCTION: Measurement of blood Favipiravir (FPV) levels and accumulation of
data in COVID-19 patients are critical for assessing FPV efficacy and safety. We 
performed a retrospective study based on measurements of blood levels of FPV and 
related factors in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital. Furthermore, we
also investigated the association between blood FPV levels and uric acid level
alterations before and after FPV administration.
METHODS: We enrolled 27 COVID-19 patients who had received FPV treatment at
Hokushin General Hospital from April 1 to December 31, 2020. Age, gender,
COVID-19 severity, presence of comorbidities, and laboratory data for each
subject were investigated to identify factors that correlate with blood FPV
levels. Uric acid levels were measured before and after FPV administration and a 
difference between the levels (i.e., a change of uric acid level) was evaluated.
RESULTS: When a significant univariate variable was input by the stepwise method 
and a combination of variables that maintained statistical superiority was
searched, serum ferritin was the only factor that independently affected blood
FPV level. Furthermore, in the high-FPV group (20 μg/mL or more), a significant
increase in uric acid levels was observed after FPV administration. The increment
value was significantly larger than that in the low-FPV group (less than
20 μg/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin level was an important independent factor inversely
affecting blood FPV level. Furthermore, a high blood FPV level induced the
elevation of uric acid levels in COVID-19 treatment.
