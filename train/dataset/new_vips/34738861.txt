Background: Primary immunodeficiency (PID) having defects related to lymphocyte
cytotoxic pathway or T-cell dysfunction are well known for developing
opportunistic infections and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases.
CARMIL2 deficiency is a recently described combined immunodeficiency (CID)
disorder characterized by defective CD28-mediated T cell co-stimulation, altered 
cytoskeletal dynamics, susceptibility to various infections and Epstein Barr
Virus smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT). Case report: We report a homozygous CARMIL2 
pathogenic variant presenting with recurrent infections and EBV associated smooth
muscle tumor (SMT) in a child. Conclusion: The present study reports that EBV SMT
may occur in a child with CARMIL2 deficiency.
