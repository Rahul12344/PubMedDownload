INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with significant
morbidity worldwide, especially among infants. We evaluated the potential impact 
of prophylactic nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody, in infants experiencing their 
first RSV season, and the number of medically-attended lower respiratory tract
infection episodes caused by RSV (RSV-MALRTI) in the USA.
METHODS: We developed an age-structured, dynamic, deterministic compartmental
model reflecting RSV natural history, incorporating USA demographic data and an
age-specific contact matrix. We assumed either no effect of nirsevimab on
transmission (scenario 1) or a 50% reduction of viral shedding (scenario 2).
Model outcomes were RSV-MALRTIs, ICD-9 coded in the Marketscan® database by
month. We focused on age groups corresponding to the first 2 years of life,
during seven RSV seasons (2008-2015).
RESULTS: Scenario 1 illustrated the direct individual benefit when a universal
immunization strategy is applied to all infants. In scenario 2, herd protection
was observed across age groups, with 15.5% of all avoided cases due to reduced
transmission; the greatest impact was in the youngest age group and a benefit was
observed in those aged 65+ years.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that single-dose nirsevimab will
benefit infants experiencing their first RSV season, with a potential increase in
effectiveness dependent on nirsevimab's mechanism of action.
