Background: Patients with cirrhosis and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have 
high in-hospital mortality. The information on outcome of cirrhosis patients in
post-hospitalization period are limited.
Aims: We aimed to study the outcome of cirrhosis patients with COVID-19 after
hospital discharge.
Methods: The records of the cirrhosis patients discharged after COVID-19 were
reviewed. Their data were compared with a similar number of cirrhosis patients
without COVID-19 after propensity score matching for age, sex, etiology of
cirrhosis, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score.
Results: Cirrhosis patients with (n=92) or without (n=92) COVID-19 were included 
in 1:1 ratio. The mortality among COVID-19 (22; 23.9%) and non-COVID-19 (19;
20.7%) were comparable (HR 1.224; 95% CI 0.663-2.263, P=0.520), over a similar
duration of follow-up [186 (86-271) vs 183 (103-274)]. Among COVID-19 patients,
45; 48.9% developed a new acute decompensation-increased ascites (40; 43.5%),
hepatic encephalopathy (20; 21.7%), or variceal bleeding (8; 8.7%) whereas 25
(27.2%) patients needed re-hospitalization. A proportion of participants
continued to have either fatigue/weakness (24/80; 30.0%), sleep disturbances
(11/80; 13.7%), or joint pains (16/80; 20.0%). The most common causes of death in
patients of both groups were end-stage liver disease: 16 (72.7%) vs 9 (47.4%),
followed by multiorgan dysfunction: 4 (18.2%) vs 6 (31.6%), GI bleeding: 2 (9.1%)
vs. 4 (21.0%), P=0.484. A lower albumin level, higher international normalized
ratio, bilirubin, Child-Turcotte-Pugh, and MELD scores at discharge predicted
mortality in the COVID-19 group.
Conclusion: Short-term outcomes of patients with cirrhosis who survive the
initial insult of COVID-19 are not different from patients without COVID-19, and 
survival is determined by the severity of liver disease at discharge.
