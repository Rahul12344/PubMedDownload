Importance: Compared with the general population, veterans are at high risk for
COVID-19 and have a complex relationship with the government. This potentially
affects their attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines.
Objective: To assess veterans' attitudes toward and intentions to receive
COVID-19 vaccines.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional web-based survey study
used data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Survey of Healthcare
Experiences of Patients' Veterans Insight Panel, fielded between March 12 and 28,
2021. Of 3420 veterans who were sent a link to complete a 58-item web-based
survey, 1178 veterans (34%) completed the survey. Data were analyzed from April 1
to August 25, 2021.
Exposures: Veterans eligible for COVID-19 vaccines.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were veterans' experiences
with COVID-19, vaccination status and intention groups, reasons for receiving or 
not receiving a vaccine, self-reported health status, and trusted and preferred
sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Reasons for not getting
vaccinated were classified into categories of vaccine deliberation, dissent,
distrust, indifference, skepticism, and policy and processes.
Results: Among 1178 respondents, 974 (83%) were men, 130 (11%) were women, and
141 (12%) were transgender or nonbinary; 58 respondents (5%) were Black, 54
veterans (5%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 987 veterans (84%) were non-Hispanic
White. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 66.7 (10.1) years. A total of 817
respondents (71%) self-reported being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of 339
respondents (29%) who were not vaccinated, those unsure of getting vaccinated
were more likely to report fair or poor overall health (32 respondents [43%]) and
mental health (33 respondents [44%]) than other nonvaccinated groups (overall
health: range, 20%-32%; mental health: range, 18%-40%). Top reasons for not being
vaccinated were skepticism (120 respondents [36%] were concerned about side
effects; 65 respondents [20%] preferred using few medications; 63 respondents
[19%] preferred gaining natural immunity), deliberation (74 respondents [22%]
preferred to wait because vaccine is new), and distrust (61 respondents [18%] did
not trust the health care system). Among respondents who were vaccinated,
preventing oneself from getting sick (462 respondents [57%]) and contributing to 
the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (453 respondents [56%]) were top reasons for
getting vaccinated. All veterans reported the VA as 1 of their top trusted
sources of information. The proportion of respondents trusting their VA health
care practitioner as a source of vaccine information was higher among those
unsure about vaccination compared with those who indicated they would definitely 
not or probably not get vaccinated (18 respondents [26%] vs 15 respondents
[15%]). There were no significant associations between vaccine intention groups
and age (χ24 = 5.90; P = .21) or gender (χ22 = 3.99; P = .14).
Conclusions and Relevance: These findings provide information needed to develop
trusted messages used in conversations between VA health care practitioners and
veterans addressing specific vaccine hesitancy reasons, as well as those in worse
health. Conversations need to emphasize societal reasons for getting vaccinated
and benefits to one's own health.
