Due to the similar clinical symptoms of influenza (Flu) and coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), there is a looming infection threat of concurrent Flu viruses
and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this work,
we introduce a customized isothermal amplification integrated lateral flow strip 
(LFS) that is capable performing duplex reverse transcription-recombinase
polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and colorimetric LFS in a sequential manner.
With customized amplification primer sets targeted to SARS-CoV-2 (opening reading
frame 1a/b and nucleoprotein genes) and Flu viruses (Flu A and Flu B), the
platform allows the rapid and simultaneous visual screening of SARS-CoV-2 and Flu
viruses (Flu A and Flu B) without cross reactivity, false positives, and false
negatives. Moreover, it maximally eases the detection, reduces the detection time
(1 h), and improves the assay performance to detect as low as 10 copies of the
viral RNA. Its clinical application is powerfully demonstrated with 100% accuracy
for evaluating 15 SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples, 10 Flu viruses-positive
clinical samples, and 5 negative clinical samples, which were pre-confirmed by
standard qRT-PCR. We envision this portable device can meet the increasing need
of online monitoring the serious infectious diseases that substantially affects
health care systems worldwide.
