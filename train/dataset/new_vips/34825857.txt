INTRODUCTION: This study is aimed at the determination of the effect of the
immune-regulatory factor NLRX1 on the antiviral activity of hepatocytes against
an external stimuli favoring hepatitis B virus infection, and to explore its
mechanism of action.
METHODS: A HepG2-NTCP model was established using the LV003 lentivirus. Cells
were transfected using an overexpression vector and NLRX1 siRNA to achieve
overexpression and interference of NLRX1 expression (OV-NLRX1, si-NLRX1). Levels 
of HBsAg and HBcAg were determined using Western blotting analysis and
immunohistochemical analysis. The levels of hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B
virus cccDNA were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
The expression and transcriptional activity of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IL-6 were
measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, and promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids.
Co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine the effect of NLRX1 on the
interaction between MAVS and RIG-1. Western blotting was used to obtain the
phosphorylation of essential proteins in the MAVS-RLRs signaling pathways.
RESULTS: NLRX1 promoted HepG2-NTCP cell hepatitis B virus infection. Compared to 
the control group, the levels of HBsAg, HBcAg, hepatitis B virus cccDNA, and
hepatitis B virus DNA increased in the OV-NLRX1 group and decreased in the
si-NLRX1. Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that NLRX1 competitively
inhibited the interaction between MAVS and RIG-1, and inhibited the
phosphorylation of p65, IRF3, and IRF7. Additionally, NLRX1 reduced the
transcription activity and expression levels of the final products: IFN-α, IFN-β,
and IL-6.
CONCLUSIONS: NLRX1 can counteract innate immune response induced by an external
stimuli favoring hepatitis B virus infection by competitive inhibition of
MAVS-RLRs signaling in HepG2-NTCP cells. Inhibition of the MAVS-RLR-mediated
signaling pathways leads to a decline in the expression levels of I-IFN and IL-6.
