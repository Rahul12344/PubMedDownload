Peroxisomes, essential subcellular organelles that fulfill important functions in
lipid and reactive oxygen species metabolism, have recently emerged as key
players during viral infections. Their importance for the establishment of the
cellular antiviral response has been highlighted by numerous reports of specific 
evasion of peroxisome-dependent signaling by different viruses. Recent data
demonstrate that peroxisomes also assume important proviral functions. Here, we
review and discuss the recent advances in the study of the diverse roles of
peroxisomes during viral infections, from animal to plant viruses, and from basic
to translational perspectives. We further discuss the future development of this 
emerging area and propose that peroxisome-related mechanisms represent a
promising target for the development of novel antiviral strategies.
