Nuclear scaffold attachment factor A (SAFA) is a novel RNA sensor involved in
sensing viral RNA in the nucleus and mediating antiviral immunity. Severe fever
with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a bunyavirus that causes SFTS
with a high fatality rate of up to 30%. It remains elusive whether and how
cytoplasmic SFTSV can be sensed by the RNA sensor SAFA. Here, we demonstrated
that SAFA was able to detect SFTSV infection and mediate antiviral interferon and
inflammatory responses. Transcription and expression levels of SAFA were
strikingly upregulated under SFTSV infection. SAFA was retained in the cytoplasm 
by interaction with SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). Importantly, SFTSV genomic
RNA was recognized by cytoplasmic SAFA, which recruited and promoted activation
of the STING-TBK1 signaling axis against SFTSV infection. Of note, the nuclear
localization signal (NLS) domain of SAFA was important for interaction with SFTSV
NP and recognition of SFTSV RNA in the cytoplasm. In conclusion, our study
reveals a novel antiviral mechanism in which SAFA functions as a novel
cytoplasmic RNA sensor that directly recognizes RNA virus SFTSV and mediates an
antiviral response.
