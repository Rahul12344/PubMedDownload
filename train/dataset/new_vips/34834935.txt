Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a higher risk of venous
thromboembolic disease (VTE) than patients with other infectious or inflammatory 
diseases, both as macrothrombosis (pulmonar embolism and deep vein thrombosis) or
microthrombosis. However, the use of anticoagulation in this scenario remains
controversial. This is a project that used DELPHI methodology to answer PICO
questions related to anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. The objective was
to reach a consensus among multidisciplinary VTE experts providing answers to
those PICO questions. Seven PICO questions regarding patients with COVID-19
responded with a broad consensus: 1. It is recommended to avoid pharmacological
thromboprophylaxis in most COVID-19 patients not requiring hospital admission; 2.
In most hospitalized patients for COVID-19 who are receiving oral anticoagulants 
before admission, it is recommended to replace them by low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) at therapeutic doses; 3. Thromboprophylaxis with LMWH at standard 
doses is suggested for COVID-19 patients admitted to a conventional hospital
ward; 4. Standard-doses thromboprophylaxis with LMWH is recommended for COVID-19 
patients requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit; 5. It is recommended not to 
determine D-Dimer levels routinely in COVID-19 hospitalized patients to select
those in whom VTE should be suspected, or as a part of the diagnostic algorithm
to rule out or confirm a VTE event; 6. It is recommended to discontinue
pharmacological thromboprophylaxis at discharge in most patients hospitalized for
COVID-19; 7. It is recommended to withdraw anticoagulant treatment after 3 months
in most patients with a VTE event associated with COVID-19. The combination of
PICO questions and DELPHI methodology provides a consensus on different
recommendations for anticoagulation management in patients with COVID-19.
