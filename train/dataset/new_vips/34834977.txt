Yersinia enterocolitica is a food-borne Gram-negative pathogen responsible for
several gastrointestinal disorders. Host-specific lytic bacteriophages have been 
increasingly used recently as an alternative or complementary treatment to combat
bacterial infections, especially when antibiotics fail. Here, we describe the
proteogenomic characterization and host receptor identification of the siphovirus
vB_YenS_ϕR2-01 (in short, ϕR2-01) that infects strains of several Yersinia
enterocolitica serotypes. The ϕR2-01 genome contains 154 predicted genes, 117 of 
which encode products that are homologous to those of Escherichia bacteriophage
T5. The ϕR2-01 and T5 genomes are largely syntenic, with the major differences
residing in areas encoding hypothetical ϕR2-01 proteins. Label-free
mass-spectrometry-based proteomics confirmed the expression of 90 of the ϕR2-01
genes, with 88 of these being either phage particle structural or
phage-particle-associated proteins. In vitro transposon-based host mutagenesis
and ϕR2-01 adsorption experiments identified the outer membrane vitamin B12
receptor BtuB as the host receptor. This study provides a proteogenomic
characterization of a T5-type bacteriophage and identifies specific Y.
enterocolitica strains sensitive to infection with possible future applications
of ϕR2-01 as a food biocontrol or phage therapy agent.
