International Nonproprietary Names (INN) are assigned by the World Health
Organization (WHO) to pharmaceutical substances to ensure global recognition by a
unique name. INN facilitate safe prescribing through naming consistency,
efficient communication and exchange of information, transnational access and
pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. Traditional vaccines such as inactivated
or live-attenuated vaccines have not been assigned INN and provision of a general
name falls within the scope of the WHO Expert Committee on Biological
Standardization (ECBS). However, novel vaccines that contain well-defined active 
ingredients such as nucleic acids or recombinant proteins fulfil the criteria to 
be assigned INN. In the current environment where multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
are being developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and with virus variants
emerging, assigning INN to well-defined vaccine substances will strengthen
pharmacovigilance and ultimately enhance the safety of vaccine recipients. This
article examines the background to INN for vaccines and explains the
applicability and value of assigning INN to novel well-defined vaccines.
