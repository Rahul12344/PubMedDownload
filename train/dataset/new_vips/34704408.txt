COVID-19 vaccine, as one of the critical measures to control the pandemic, has
been administered in nearly all countries. However, the new-onset and relapsing
glomerular diseases associated with COVID-19 vaccination have become a new
concern. Both mRNA vaccine and inactivated vaccine may cause new-onset and
relapsing glomerular diseases; these diseases would occur after the first dose
vaccination or the second dose. New-onset glomerular disease is mainly minimal
change glomerulopathy, which is mostly sensitive to steroid, while relapsing
cases have good prognosis, and some cases can be spontaneously remitted. The
pathogenesis of these vaccine-associated diseases is possibly due to the humoral 
and cellular immune responses. In this article, we provide a general review of
the new-onset and relapsing glomerular diseases related to COVID-19 vaccination, 
and make suggestions for patients with kidney diseases to receive COVID-19
vaccination.
