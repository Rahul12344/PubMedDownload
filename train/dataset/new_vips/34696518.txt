Since the explosive outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil and South/Central America in
2015-2016, the frequency of infections has subsided, but Zika virus remains
present in this region as well as other tropical and sub-tropical areas of the
globe. The most alarming aspect of Zika virus infection is its association with
severe birth defects when infection occurs in pregnant women. Understanding the
mechanism of Zika virus pathogenesis, which comprises features unique to Zika
virus as well as shared with other teratogenic pathogens, is key to future
prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Nonhuman primate-based research has
played a significant role in advancing our knowledge of Zika virus pathogenesis, 
especially with regard to fetal infection. This review summarizes what we have
learned from these models and potential future research directions.
