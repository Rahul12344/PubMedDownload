The effects of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) public health policies on
non-COVID-19-related mortality are unclear. Here, using death registries based on
300 million Chinese people and a difference-in-differences design, we find that
China's strict anti-contagion policies during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly
reduced non-COVID-19 mortality outside Wuhan (by 4.6%). The health benefits
persisted and became even greater after the measures were loosened: mortality was
reduced by 12.5% in the medium term. Significant changes in people's behaviours
(for example, wearing masks and practising social distancing) and reductions in
air pollution and traffic accidents could have driven these results. We estimate 
that 54,000 lives could have been saved from non-COVID-19 causes during the 50
days of strict policies and 293,000 in the subsequent 115 days. The results
suggest that virus countermeasures not only effectively controlled COVID-19 in
China but also brought about unintended and substantial public health benefits.
