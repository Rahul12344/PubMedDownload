Memory T (TM) cells play an important role in the long-term defense against
pathogen reinvasion. However, it is still unclear how these cells receive the
crucial signals necessary for their longevity and homeostatic turnover. To
understand how TM cells receive these signals, we infected mice with lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and examined the expression sites of neural
cadherin (N-cadherin) by immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that N-cadherin 
was expressed in the surroundings of the white pulps of the spleen and medulla of
lymph nodes (LNs). Moreover, TM cells expressing high levels of killer cell
lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), a ligand of N-cadherin, were co-localized with
N-cadherin+ cells in the spleen but not in LNs. We then blocked N-cadherin in
vivo to investigate whether it regulates the formation or function of TM cells.
The numbers of CD127hiCD62Lhi TM cells in the spleen of memory P14 chimeric mice 
declined when N-cadherin was blocked during the contraction phase, without
functional impairment of these cells. In addition, when CD127loKLRG1hi TM cells
were adoptively transferred into anti-N-cadherin-treated mice compared with
control mice, the number of these cells was reduced in the bone marrow and LNs,
without functional loss. Taken together, our results suggest that N-cadherin
participates in the development of CD127hiCD62Lhi TM cells and homing of
CD127loKLRG1hi TM cells to lymphoid organs.
