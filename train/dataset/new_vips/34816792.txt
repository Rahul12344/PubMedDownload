Several viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are thought to replicate
in the placenta. However, there is little understanding of the molecular
mechanisms involved in HCMV replication in this tissue. We investigated
replication of HCMV in the extravillous trophoblast cell line SGHPL-4, a commonly
used model of HCMV replication in the placenta. We found limited HCMV protein
expression and virus replication in SGHPL-4 cells. This was associated with a
lack of trophoblast progenitor cell protein markers in SGHPL-4 cells, suggesting 
a relationship between trophoblast differentiation and limited HCMV replication. 
We proposed that limited HCMV replication in trophoblast cells is advantageous to
vertical transmission of HCMV, as there is a greater opportunity for vertical
transmission when the placenta is intact and functional. Furthermore, when we
investigated the replication of other vertically transmitted viruses in SGHPL-4
cells we found some limitation to replication of Zika virus, but not herpes
simplex virus. Thus, limited replication of some, but not all, vertically
transmitted viruses may be a feature of trophoblast cells.
