Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are widely used for gene therapy, providing 
treatment for diseases caused by absent or defective genes. Despite the success
of gene therapy, AAV manufacturing is still challenging, with production yields
being limited. With increased patient demand, improvements in host cell
productivity through various engineering strategies will be necessary. Here, we
study the host cell proteome of AAV5-producing HEK293 cells using reversed phase 
nano-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS). Relative
label-free quantitation (LFQ) was performed, allowing a comparison of transfected
vs. untransfected cells. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis revealed
differential expression of proteins involved in fundamental cellular processes
such as metabolism, proliferation, and cell death. Furthermore, changes in
expression of proteins involved in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation were
observed. Our data provides highly valuable insights into cellular mechanisms
involved during recombinant AAV production by HEK293 cells, thus potentially
enabling further improvements of gene therapy product manufacturing.
