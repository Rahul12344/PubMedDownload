The COVID-19 pandemic has caused various impacts on people's lives, while changes
in people's lives have shown mixed effects on mitigating the spread of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Understanding how to capture such two-way interactions is
crucial, not only to control the pandemic but also to support post-pandemic urban
recovery policies. As suggested by the life-oriented approach, the above
interactions exist with respect to a variety of life domains, which form a
complex behavior system. Through a review of the literature, this paper first
points out inconsistent evidence about behavioral factors affecting the spread of
COVID-19, and then argues that existing studies on the impacts of COVID-19 on
people's lives have ignored behavioral co-changes in multiple life domains.
Furthermore, selected uncertain trends of people's lives for the post-pandemic
recovery are described. Finally, this paper concludes with a summary about "what 
should be computed?" in Computational Urban Science with respect to how to catch 
up with delays in the SDGs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, how to address
digital divides and dilemmas of e-society, how to capture behavioral co-changes
during the post-pandemic recovery process, and how to better manage post-pandemic
recovery policymaking processes.
