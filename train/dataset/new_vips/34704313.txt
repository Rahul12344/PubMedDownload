This is the first known case report of severe intrauterine adhesion (IUA)
following a life-threatening event caused by an Epstein-Barr virus-associated
atraumatic spleen laceration. A 22-year-old nulligravid female suffered from
infectious mononucleosis for approximately 1 month. Sudden severe hypovolemic
shock with massive hemoperitoneum appeared and hemostasis was completely achieved
by a splenectomy for an atraumatic spleen laceration, although that was followed 
by multiorgan failure and abdominal compartment syndrome. Complete recovery
without any neurological sequelae was achieved by intensive treatment. A
postoperative pathological evaluation revealed Epstein-Barr virus-associated
splenomegaly. The patient was referred to our department because of secondary
amenorrhea for approximately 5 months since the last menstruation, which occurred
just prior to the event. Laboratory blood test results demonstrated normal
thyroid and ovarian functions. Hysterofiberscopy revealed complete obstruction at
the end of the cervical canal, indicating secondary uterine amenorrhea caused by 
severe IUA. Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis with a rigid hysteroscope reached the
opening of the uterine cavity and menstruation was restored.
