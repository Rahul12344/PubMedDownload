The present study evaluated the IL8-251 A/T polymorphism in samples from 74
patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV), 100 patients with chronic hepatitis C
(HCV), and 300 healthy donors (CG). The correlations of this polymorphism with
plasma IL-8 and disease stage were calculated. Polymorphisms were identified by
real-time PCR. IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
IL8-251 A/T genotype was not associated with susceptibility to infection by HBV
or HCV. The wild-type allele (A) was associated with higher levels of
inflammation (p = 0.0464) and fibrosis scores (p = 0.0016) in the HBV group,
representing an increased risk for increased inflammatory activity (OR = 1.84; p 
= 0.0464) and for high fibrosis scores (OR = 2.63; p = 0.0016). Viral load was
higher in HBV patients with polymorphic genotypes (TA and TT) at the IL8-251 A/T 
polymorphism than in those with the wild-type genotype (p = 0.0272 and p =
0.0464, respectively). Plasma IL-8 was higher among patients infected with HBV or
HCV than in the control group (p = 0.0445 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The
polymorphic genotype was associated with lower IL-8 than the wild-type genotype
in the HBV group (p = 0.0239) and the HCV group (p = 0.0372). The wild-type
genotype for IL8-251 A/T and high IL-8 were associated with a worse prognosis for
infections; therefore, they may contribute to viral persistence and the
development of more severe forms of chronic viral liver diseases.
