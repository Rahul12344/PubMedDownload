BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients are among high-risk groups for COVID-19. Africa
is the continent with the lowest number of cases in the general population but we
have little information about the disease burden in dialysis patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in the hemodialysis population of Senegal.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional survey, between 
June and September 2020 involving 10 public dialysis units randomly selected in
eight regions of Senegal. After seeking their consent, we included 303 patients
aged ≥ 18 years and hemodialysis for ≥ 3 months. Clinical symptoms and biological
parameters were collected from medical records. Patients' blood samples were
tested with Abbott SARS-CoV-2 Ig G assay using an Architect system. Statistical
tests were performed with STATA 12.0.
RESULTS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 21.1% (95% CI = 16.7-26.1%).
We noticed a wide variability in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence between regions
ranging from 5.6 to 51.7%. Among the 38 patients who underwent nasal swab
testing, only six had a PCR-confirmed infection and all of them did seroconvert. 
Suggestive clinical symptoms were reported by 28.1% of seropositive patients and 
the majority of them presented asymptomatic disease. After multivariate analysis,
a previous contact with a confirmed case and living in a high population density 
region were associated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
CONCLUSION: This study presents to our knowledge the first seroprevalence data in
African hemodialysis patients. Compared to data from other continents, we found a
higher proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies but a lower lethality
rate.
