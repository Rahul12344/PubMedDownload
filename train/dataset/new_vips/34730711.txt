OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics and the factors associated with
mortality of cases hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome in a health
region, in pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.
METHODS: A retrospective documentary study of epidemiological surveillance
carried out with secondary data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance
Information System, regarding the cases of patients belonging to a health region 
of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
RESULTS: During the pandemic period, there was an increase in the number of
hospitalizations and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome, in addition
to differences between sociodemographic and clinical-epidemiological
characteristics. In both periods, the age and the use of invasive ventilatory
support were the predictors of hospital mortality. The mortality in the pandemic 
period was also associated with male gender, presence of risk factors, admission 
to an intensive care unit, use of non-invasive ventilatory support, and infection
by COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, the detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome was
21 times higher than in 2019 and new symptoms, such as anosmia and ageusia, were 
included in their investigation. In both periods evaluated, elderly patients and 
patients on invasive mechanical ventilation had a higher risk of mortality. With 
the pandemic, there was a greater number of hospitalizations and factors
associated with mortality.
