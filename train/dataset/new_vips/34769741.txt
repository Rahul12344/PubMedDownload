While protective measures in response to infectious diseases may reduce the
freedom of tourists (regarding their behaviors), few studies have documented the 
effects of destination protective measures on the self-protective behaviors of
tourists. By applying the protection motivation theory, this study examines the
effects of perceived destination protective supports on the social distancing
intentions of tourists during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal
significant relationships among perceived destination support, coping appraisal, 
threat appraisal, and the social distancing intentions of tourists. Moreover, two
cognitive appraisals-toward the pandemic-partially mediate the relationship
between perceived destination support and social distancing intention, and this
mediational process is 'intervened' with by social norms. This has implications
on whether tourist destinations apply more rigorous social distancing polices
during the COVID-19 pandemic, to enhance the coping confidence behaviors of
tourists, without causing anxiety and fear, and to achieve the goal of enhancing 
tourists' intentions to protect themselves.
