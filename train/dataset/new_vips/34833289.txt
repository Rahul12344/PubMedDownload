Herein, in the present work two series of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)
nanofibers were manufactured using the electrospinning techniques with ZnO and
CuO nanoparticles for a potential use as an elastic functional layer in
antimicrobial applications. Percentages of 0%, 2 wt%, and 4 wt% of the
nanoparticles were used. The morphological characterization of the electrospun
TPU and TPU/NPs composites nanofibers were observed by using scanning electron
microscopy to show the average fiber diameter and it was in the range of 90-150
nm with a significant impact of the nanoparticle type. Mechanical
characterization showed that TPU nanofiber membranes exhibit excellent mechanical
properties with ultra-high elastic properties. Elongation at break reached up to 
92.5%. The assessment of the developed nanofiber membranes for medical and
personal protection applications was done against various colistin resistant
bacterial strains and the results showed an increment activity by increasing the 
metal oxide concentration up to 83% reduction rate by using TPU/ZnO 4% nanofibers
against K. pneumoniae strain 10. The bacterial growth was completely eradicated
after 8 and 16 h incubation with TPU/ZnO and TPU/CuO nanofibers, respectively.
The nanofibers SEM study reveals the adsorption of the bacterial cells on the
metal oxides nanofibers surface which led to cell lysis and releasing of their
content. Finally, in vitro study against Spike S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 was also
evaluated to investigate the potent effectiveness of the proposed nanofibers in
the virus deactivation. The results showed that the metal oxide concentration is 
an effective factor in the antiviral activity due to the observed pattern of
increasing the antibacterial and antiviral activity by increasing the metal oxide
concentration; however, TPU/ZnO nanofibers showed a potent antiviral activity in 
relation to TPU/CuO.
