BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic,
affecting the therapeutic management for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Any decision
regarding the discontinuation of high-potency agents for moderate and highly
active MS should be carefully evaluated, taking into account the potential risk
of rebound of the disease. In particular, no data about clinical outcome of
patients with MS receiving Natalizumab (NTZ) during active COVID-19 infection
have been reported yet.
CASES PRESENTATION: We reported on 6 patients treated with NTZ for relapsing MS
during active COVID-19 infection, who recovered without reporting any worsening
or new symptoms. Most of the patients were asymptomatic, with the exception of
one patient who had a slight worst COVID-19 clinical course. No patients received
O2-therapy or required intensive care. No neurological complications were
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper reported the clinical outcome of patients with MS
receiving NTZ during active COVID-19 infection. This case series suggests that
treatment with NTZ during pandemic is relatively safe and might be continued in
selected patients who are infected by COVID-19, thereby reducing the risk of MS
disease rebound.
