Polysaccharides have anti-virus, anti-cancer, anti-oxidation, immune regulation, 
hypoglycemia and other biological activities. Because of their safety, fewer side
effects and other advantages, polysaccharides are considered as ideal raw
materials in food and drugs. The biological activity of polysaccharides can be
improved by structural modification (such as sulfation, carboxymethylation,
phosphorylation, etc.), and even new biological activity can be generated. In
this review, the recent advances in the phosphorylation of polysaccharides were
reviewed from the perspectives of modification methods, structures, biological
activities and structure-activity relationships.
