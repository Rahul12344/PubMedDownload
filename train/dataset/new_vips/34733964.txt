Background: The interaction between hepatitis B virus (HBV) load and
anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 in combination with (+) antiangiogenic therapy 
remains controversial, especially for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
This study sought to explore the effects of HBV load and antiviral therapy on
anti-PD-1+ antiangiogenic therapy, and the rate of HBV reactivation during
anti-PD-1+ antiangiogenic treatment.
Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of camrelizumab
combined with apatinib (C+A) therapy between January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2021 
in patients with unresectable HCC who were seropositive for hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) and received antiviral therapy before C+A involvement. The
effects of HBV load and antiviral therapy on C+A and the rate of HBV reactivation
during C+A treatment were examined.
Results: Eighty-six patients were included in the analysis. The patients had a
mean age of 55 years, and 72 (83.7%) were male. The objective response rates
(ORRs) in patients with low (<2,000 IU/mL) and high (≥2,000 IU/mL) baseline HBV
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels were 34.5% and 32.2%, respectively (χ2=0.046; 
P=0.829), while the disease control rates (DCRs) were 67.3% and 80.6%,
respectively (χ2=1.762; P=0.184). The results of the univariate and multivariate 
analyses showed that the baseline HBV DNA level did not affect PD. Additionally, 
none of the 86 patients suffered from HBV reactivation or HBV-related hepatic
impairment with continuous antiviral treatment, regardless of nucleos(t)ide
analogue (NA) type (F=1.473; P=0.228).
Conclusions: Baseline HBV loads did not affect the tumor responses of HCC
patients receiving anti-PD-1+ antiangiogenic therapy. Thus, HBV reactivation
should not be a contradiction for anti-PD-1+ antiangiogenic therapy among
patients undergoing continuous and effective antiviral treatment.
