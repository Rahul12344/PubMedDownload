Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with characteristic skin
manifestations. Several pathogens can cause flare-ups of psoriasis. The risks of 
skin infections are increased in patients receiving immunomodulators. A patient
with chronic psoriasis presented with human papillomavirus infection and
anogenital warts and was treated surgically with acceptable results.
