Context: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness
which was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. A few case studies
demonstrated that 14-53% of the cases of COVID-19 reported abnormal levels of
liver enzymes during disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to
have higher rates of hepatic dysfunction.
Aims: Our aim was to investigate the changes in the liver function test in
COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and its association with the severity of
the disease, length of hospital stay, and outcome of patients.
Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional study involving 678 COVID-19
patients, who were admitted at AIIMS, Bhopal.
Methods and Material: The case records of 678 patients were evaluated by the
research team from the Department of Medicine, AIIMS, Bhopal, and data were
analyzed. All laboratory data were obtained. The liver function tests (LFT)
including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total
bilirubin values were recorded, and liver dysfunction defined as any parameter
having more than the upper limit of normal value.
Results: From April 2020 to September 2020, a total of 678 COVID-19 patients were
screened, and 600 were assessed for eligibility; 78 were excluded due to either
significant alcohol history or due to prior liver disease. Among the 600
patients, 265 patients (44.16%) had liver dysfunction while 335 patients (55.83%)
had a normal liver function. The patients having a severe disease were more
affected by liver dysfunction than the mild disease patients. The average
hospital stay was more in those patients having liver dysfunction than in those
patients with normal liver function. Among the patients with normal LFT on
admission, 97.9% got cured while 2.1% died. Among the patients with liver
dysfunction, 80.4% got cured and 19.6% died.
Conclusions: Hepatic injury is common in severe COVID-19 patients, which may be
caused by direct injury to the bile duct cells by a virus or indirectly by a
cytokine storm. The liver function should be evaluated in all symptomatic
COVID-19 patients. In patients with pre-existing liver diseases, special
attention should be paid to monitoring and treatment.
