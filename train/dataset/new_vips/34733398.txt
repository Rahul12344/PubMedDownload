Introduction: hepatitis C is a public health problem worldwide, in particular in 
sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this study is to determine the seroprevalence 
of hepatitis C virus antibodies and associated factors during a voluntary general
population screening program in Benin.
Method: we conducted a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study in 4 big 
cities of 4 different departments in Benin in July 2016. All volunteers of all
ages, residing in these targeted cities, who gave their informed consent were
included in the study. ImuMed HCV Rapid Diagnostic Test (Healgen Scientific LLC, 
USA) was used. Logistic regression analysis was also used to identify factors
associated with hepatitis C virus infection.
Results: a total of 2809 volunteers with an average age of 25.9 ± 16.5 years
(ranging from 0 to 86 years) were included in the study; 53.9% (1514/2809) of
them were men and 46.1% (1295/2809) were women. More than half of the study
population consisted of single (59.1%; 1612/2726); 41.3% (1074/2809) were pupils 
or students. VHC Seroprevalence was 1.5% (42/2809). In multivariate analysis, the
variables significantly associated with anti-HCV carriage were: be 60 years old
and older (aOR: 46.9, 95% CI 10.2-216.0; p<0.0001) and a history of alcoholism
(aOR: 6.3; 95% CI 95% 3.3-12.1; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: in the general population, the seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibodies 
was 1.5%. HCV infection mainly occurred in people aged 60 years and older and in 
those with a history of alcoholism.
