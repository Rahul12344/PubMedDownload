Current coronavirus (CoV) vaccines primarily target immunodominant epitopes in
the S1 subunit, which are poorly conserved and susceptible to escape mutations,
thus threatening vaccine efficacy. Here, we use structure-guided protein
engineering to remove the S1 subunit from the Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein and develop stabilized stem (SS) antigens.
Vaccination with MERS SS elicits cross-reactive β-CoV antibody responses and
protects mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. High-throughput screening of
antibody-secreting cells from MERS SS-immunized mice led to the discovery of a
panel of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. Among them, antibody IgG22 binds
with high affinity to both MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV-2 S proteins, and a combination of electron microscopy and crystal
structures localizes the epitope to a conserved coiled-coil region in the S2
subunit. Passive transfer of IgG22 protects mice against both MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Collectively, these results provide a proof of principle
for cross-reactive CoV antibodies and inform the development of pan-CoV vaccines 
and therapeutic antibodies.
