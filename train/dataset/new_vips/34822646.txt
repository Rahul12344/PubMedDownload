Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) poses significant financial and biosecurity
challenges to the commercial poultry farming industry. IBV is the causative agent
of multi-systemic infection in the respiratory, reproductive and renal systems,
which is similar to the symptoms of various viral and bacterial diseases reported
in chickens. The avian immune system manifests the ability to respond to
subsequent exposure with an antigen by stimulating mucosal, humoral and
cell-mediated immunity. However, the immune response against IBV presents a
dilemma due to the similarities between the different serotypes that infect
poultry. Currently, the live attenuated and killed vaccines are applied for the
control of IBV infection; however, the continual emergence of IB variants with
rapidly evolving genetic variants increases the risk of outbreaks in intensive
poultry farms. This review aims to focus on IBV challenge-infection, route and
delivery of vaccines and vaccine-induced immune responses to IBV. Various
commercial vaccines currently have been developed against IBV protection for
accurate evaluation depending on the local situation. This review also highlights
and updates the limitations in controlling IBV infection in poultry with issues
pertaining to antiviral therapy and good biosecurity practices, which may aid in 
establishing good biorisk management protocols for its control and which will, in
turn, result in a reduction in economic losses attributed to IBV infection.
