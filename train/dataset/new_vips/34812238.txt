Background: Emerging evidence has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with cardiac injury, but it
remains unclear whether cardiac injury is mainly caused by direct viral infection
or is secondary to SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm.
Methods: Through directly treating cardiomyocytes with S protein, a crucial
surface protein of SARS-CoV-2, and indirectly treating cardiomyocytes with S
protein-derived human T lymphocyte conditioned medium, we compared the
intensities of cardiomyocyte injuries caused by either S protein of the virus or 
S protein of virus-triggered cytokines.
Results: The directly treated cardiomyocytes did not show increasing cell
apoptosis. In contrast, cardiomyocytes treated with the supernatant medium of S
protein pre-conditioned peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed significantly
suppressed viability. In addition, using a cardiovascular disease-specific PCR
array, genes associated with hypertrophy, apoptosis, inflammation and
angiogenesis were observed to be affected by cytokine stress.
Conclusions: Collectively, we found that SARS-CoV-2-induced heart injury may be
mainly through the S protein of the virus enhancing host immune responses instead
of the S protein of the virus per se. With regards to clinical application, the
strategy for treating COVID-19 should not only focus on anti-viral therapy but
also on suppressing over-activated immunity.
