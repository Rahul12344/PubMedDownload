Viral diseases remain a significant global health threat, and therefore
prioritization of limited healthcare resources is required to effectively manage 
dangerous viral disease outbreaks. In a pandemic of a newly emerged virus that is
yet to be well understood, a noninvasive host-derived prognostic biomarker is
invaluable for risk prediction. Red bloodÂ cell distribution width (RDW), an index
of red blood cell size disorder (anisocytosis), is a potential predictive
biomarker for severity of many diseases. In view of the need to prioritize
resources during response to outbreaks, this review highlights the prospects and 
challenges of RDW as a prognostic biomarker for viral infections, with a focus on
hepatitis and COVID-19, and provides an outlook to improve the prognostic
performance of RDW for risk prediction in viral diseases.
