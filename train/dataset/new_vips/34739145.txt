One of the emerging subjects to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus is to design accurate
and efficient drug such as inhibitors against the viral protease to stop the
viral spread. In addition to laboratory investigation of the viral protease,
which is fundamental, the in silico research of viral protease such as the
protease cleavage site prediction is critically important and urgent. However,
this problem has yet to be addressed. This article has, for the first time,
investigated this problem using the pattern recognition approaches. The article
has shown that the pattern recognition approaches incorporating a specially
tailored kernel function for dealing with amino acids has the outstanding
performance in the accuracy of cleavage site prediction and the discovery of the 
prototype cleavage peptides.
