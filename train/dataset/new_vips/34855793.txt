Little is known about how specific individual viral lineages replicating
systemically during acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus or Simian Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV/SIV) infection persist into chronic infection. In this study, we use
molecularly barcoded SIV (SIVmac239M) to track distinct viral lineages for 12
weeks after intravenous (IV) or intrarectal (IR) challenge in macaques. Two
Mafa-A1*063+ cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis, CM) were challenged IV,
and two Mamu-A1*001+ rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, RM) were challenged IR with
200,000 Infectious Units (IU) of SIVmac239M. We sequenced the molecular barcode
of SIVmac239M from all animals over the 12 weeks of the study to characterize the
diversity and persistence of virus lineages. During the first three weeks
post-infection, we found ~70-560 times more unique viral lineages circulating in 
the animals challenged IV compared to those challenged IR, which is consistent
with the hypothesis that the challenge route is the primary driver restricting
the transmission of individual viral lineages. We also characterized the
sequences of T cell epitopes targeted during acute SIV infection, and found that 
the emergence of escape variants in acutely targeted epitopes can occur on
multiple virus templates simultaneously, but that elimination of some of these
templates is likely a consequence of additional host factors. These data imply
that virus lineages present during acute infection can still be eliminated from
the systemic virus population even after initial selection.
