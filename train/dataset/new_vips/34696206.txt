Following a successful Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination pilot in 2013-2015
in Kitui county, Kenya introduced the HPV vaccine in October 2019 with a goal to 
immunize approximately 800,000 girls annually against HPV. Our study assessed the
knowledge, attitudes, and practice of affected groups towards HPV infection and
vaccination in two counties of Kenya. Semi-structured interviews from children
aged between nine and thirteen years and key informants comprising of parents,
head teachers, community leaders and health workers involved in HPV vaccination
in health facilities from Mombasa and Tana-River counties were conducted. Content
was analyzed thematically and coded for emerging themes using the QRS Nvivo 12
Plus (QRS International, Doncaster, Australia) software package. From our
findings, a significant proportion of participants, especially children, have
limited knowledge of the subject. Vaccination of boys was opposed by most
participants. Parents and the community members are not in favor of HPV
vaccination, as compared to the other groups. A similar pattern of inadequate
knowledge and strongly opposed attitudes was observed in Tana-River and Mombasa. 
Active community involvement in primary prevention strategies may promote the
uptake of the vaccine which can be achieved by robust awareness, modifying the
negative beliefs about HPV vaccine and encouraging the perceptibility of HPV
vaccination.
