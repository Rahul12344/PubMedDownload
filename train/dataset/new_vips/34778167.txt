This study analyses the UAE leadership's approach in response to the COVID-19
crisis through the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's
Strategic Crisis Management Framework. This framework analyzes the crisis
management in three phases: the preparedness, the response to mitigate damage and
the feedback mechanism after the crisis. The analysis showed that the key
components of the UAE's crisis management included efficient and able governance,
integrated utilization of public-private partnerships and a global workforce of
excellence. As a result, the UAE now ranks among the top 10 countries worldwide
for its leadership and proactive approach during the COVID-19 pandemic, according
to Global Response to Infectious Diseases Index. The SWOT analysis on the
response toward COVID-19 crisis management helped in critically analyzing and
understanding the UAE's unified and systematic response to the pandemic, which
provides developing and developed countries alike a new high standard for
leadership and effective public health management.
