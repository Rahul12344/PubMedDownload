Background: Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) are responsible for a variety of clinical
symptoms, with an increasing significance in the poultry industry throughout the 
world. Typical diseases caused by FAdVs include inclusion body hepatitis (IBH),
hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), gizzard erosion (GE), respiratory
disease, and hemorrhage in muscles and organs.
Aims: During 2020, broiler chickens from the north of Iran showed ecchymotic and 
petechial hemorrhages in thigh and breast muscles at the slaughterhouse.
Hemorrhages were observed in 10% to 60% (with an average of 20-30%) of chicks per
flock. To find out the etiology of these lesions, the present study was
conducted.
Methods: Different environmental factors were investigated, and FAdV, infectious 
bursal disease virus (IBDV), and chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) were
detected using molecular assays.
Results: Among the viruses tested, FAdV was detected by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), and sequence analysis clustered the virus into species E, serotype 7.
Conclusion: This is the first report on FAdV-7 existence among poultry in Iran.
Effective screening of the chicks at slaughtering age should be performed from
the whole country.
