Duck circovirus (DuCV) is widespread across the world and causes feather
disorders in young ducks. It was identified as the causative pathogen of duck
beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In this
study, we aimed to establish a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay to detect DuCV.
The primers and probe were designed based on the conserved region of the DuCV Rep
gene. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the minimum virus detection limit
of the designed PCR technique was 39.4 copies/μL, 100 times that of conventional 
PCR (cPCR). No cross-reaction with six other common duck viruses was observed.
The intra- and inter-assay variations were less than 1%. The detection rate of
DuCV-positive clinical samples using TaqMan-based real-time PCR was higher than
that using SYBR Green-based real-time PCR and cPCR. Collectively, these results
showed that the established TaqMan-based real-time PCR detected DuCV with high
sensitivity and specificity, and significant repeatability, making it suitable
for clinical use. Hence, it may be used as a novel tool for the diagnosis and
epidemiological investigation of DuCV.
