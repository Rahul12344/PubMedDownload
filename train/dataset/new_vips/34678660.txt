Long QT syndrome (LQTS) often causes malignant arrhythmia and syncope. Mutations 
in the SCN5A gene are the main cause of type 3 LQTS. In this study, we generated 
a human induced pluripotent stem cell line ZJYYPHi001-A from a female LQTS
patient harboring a heterozygous mutation in SCN5A using non-integrative Sendai
virus. This cell line expressed pluripotency markers, had the normal karyotype
and could differentiate into three germ layers in vitro.
