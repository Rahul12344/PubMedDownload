Nonclassical T cells are a heterogeneous group of T lymphocytes that are
activated during the early stages of infection and act as a bridge between the
innate and adaptive immune system. Among them, Natural Killer T (NKT) cells have 
been extensively studied in the last two decades due to their unique ability to
recognize foreign/self-lipid antigens in the context of CD1d, a nonclassical
major histocompatibility complex molecule. In this chapter, we describe our
protocols to track murine NKT cells in lymph nodes by flow cytometry and confocal
microscopy.
