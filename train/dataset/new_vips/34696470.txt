Feline calicivirus (FCV) causes upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and
sporadic outbreaks of virulent systemic disease (FCV-VSD). The basis for the
increased pathogenicity of FCV-VSD viruses is incompletely understood, and
antivirals for FCV-VSD have yet to be developed. We investigated the
clinicoepidemiology and viral features of three FCV-VSD outbreaks in Australia
and evaluated the in vitro efficacy of nitazoxanide (NTZ), 2'-C-methylcytidine
(2CMC) and NITD-008 against FCV-VSD viruses. Overall mortality among 23 cases of 
FCV-VSD was 39%. Metagenomic sequencing identified five genetically distinct FCV 
lineages within the three outbreaks, all seemingly evolving in situ in Australia.
Notably, no mutations that clearly distinguished FCV-URTD from FCV-VSD phenotypes
were identified. One FCV-URTD strain likely originated from a recombination
event. Analysis of seven amino-acid residues from the hypervariable E region of
the capsid in the cultured viruses did not support the contention that properties
of these residues can reliably differentiate between the two pathotypes. On
plaque reduction assays, dose-response inhibition of FCV-VSD was obtained with
all antivirals at low micromolar concentrations; NTZ EC50, 0.4-0.6 µM, TI = 21;
2CMC EC50, 2.7-5.3 µM, TI > 18; NITD-008, 0.5 to 0.9 µM, TI > 111. Investigation 
of these antivirals for the treatment of FCV-VSD is warranted.
