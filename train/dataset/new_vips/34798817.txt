BACKGROUND: Older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are at increased 
risk for a severe course of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and
vulnerable to mental health problems. We aimed to investigate prevalence and
associated patient (demographic and clinical) characteristics of mental wellbeing
(health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and symptoms of depression and anxiety)
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in older patients with advanced chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: An ongoing Dutch multicentre prospective cohort study enrols patients of
≥70 years with an eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m2 from October 2018 onward. With
additional questionnaires during the pandemic (May-June 2020), disease-related
concerns about COVID-19 and general anxiety symptoms were assessed
cross-sectionally, and depressive symptoms, HRQoL, and emotional symptoms
longitudinally.
RESULTS: The 82 included patients had a median age of 77.5 years (interquartile
range 73.9-82.1), 77% were male and none had tested positive for COVID-19.
Cross-sectionally, 67% of the patients reported to be more anxious about COVID-19
because of their kidney disease, and 43% of the patients stated that their
quality of life was reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to
pre-COVID-19, the presence of depressive symptoms had increased (11 to 22%;
p = .022) and physical HRQoL declined (M = 40.4, SD = 10.1 to M = 36.1,
SD = 10.4; p < .001), particularly in males. Mental HRQoL (M = 50.3, SD = 9.6 to 
M = 50.4, SD = 9.9; p = .913) and emotional symptoms remained similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease suffered from
disease-related anxiety about COVID-19, increased depressive symptoms and reduced
physical HRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on this
vulnerable patient group extends beyond increased mortality risk, and awareness
of mental wellbeing is important.
