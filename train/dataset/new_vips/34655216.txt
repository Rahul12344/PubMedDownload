BACKGROUND: Circadian transcription factors that regulate cell-autonomous
circadian clocks can also increase HIV transcription in vitro. We aimed to
determine if circadian variation in HIV transcription exists in people living
with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of male PLHIV on ART,
sampling blood every four hours for 24 hours. Using qPCR, we quantified
expression of circadian associated genes, HIV DNA and cell-associated unspliced
(CA-US) RNA in peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells. Plasma sex hormones were quantified
alongside plasma and salivary cortisol. The primary outcome was to identify
temporal variations in CA-US HIV RNA using a linear mixed effect regression
framework and maximum likelihood estimation.
RESULTS: Salivary and plasma cortisol, and circadian genes including Clock,
Bmal1, and Per3 varied with a circadian rhythm. CA-US HIV RNA and the ratio of
CA-US HIV RNA-to-DNA in CD4+ T-cells also demonstrated circadian variations, with
no variation in HIV DNA. Circulating oestradiol was highly predictive of CA-US
HIV RNA variation in vivo.
CONCLUSION: CA-US HIV RNA in PLHIV on ART varies temporally with a circadian
rhythm. These findings have implications for the design of clinical trials and
biomarkers to assess HIV cure interventions.
