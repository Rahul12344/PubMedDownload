BACKGROUND: The infection by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been especially serious in
older patients. The aim of this study is to describe baseline and clinical
characteristics, hospital referrals, 60-day mortality, factors associated with
hospital referrals and mortality in older patients living in nursing homes (NH)
with suspected COVID-19.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed during March and April
2020 of institutionalized patients assessed by a liaison geriatric hospital-based
team. Were collected all older patients living in 31 nursing homes of a public
hospital catchment area assessed by a liaison geriatric team due to the suspicion
of COVID-19 during the first wave, when the hospital system was collapsed.
Sociodemographic variables, comprehensive geriatric assessment, clinical
characteristics, treatment received including care setting, and 60-days mortality
were recorded from electronic medical records. A logistic regression analysis was
performed to analyze the factors associated with mortality.
RESULTS: 419 patients were included in the study (median age 89 years old, 71.6 %
women, 63.7 % with moderate-severe dependence, and 43.8 % with advanced
dementia). 31.1 % were referred to the emergency department in the first
assessment, with a higher rate of hospital referral in those with better
functional and mental status. COVID-19 atypical symptoms like functional decline,
delirium, or eating disorders were frequent. 36.9% had died in the 60 days
following the first call. According to multivariate logistic regression age (p
0.010), Barthel index <60 (p 0.002), presence of tachypnea (p 0.021), fever (p
0.006) and the use of ceftriaxone (p 0.004) were associated with mortality. No
mortality differences were found between those referred to the hospital or cared 
at the nursing home.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: 31% of the nursing home patients assessed by a
liaison geriatric hospital-based team for COVID-19 were referred to the hospital,
being more frequently referred those with a better functional and cognitive
situation. The 60-days mortality rate due to COVID-19 was 36.8% and was
associated with older age, functional dependence, the presence of tachypnea and
fever, and the use of ceftriaxone. Geriatric comprehensive assessment and
coordination between NH and the hospital geriatric department teams were crucial.
