Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected >235
million people and killed over 4.8 million individuals worldwide. Although
vaccines have been developed for prophylactic management, there are no clinically
proven antivirals to treat the viral infection. Continuous efforts are being made
all over the world to develop effective drugs but these are being delayed by
periodic outbreak of mutated SARS-CoV-2 and a lack of knowledge of molecular
mechanisms underlying viral pathogenesis and post-infection complications. In
this regard, the involvement of Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a lipid-raft related
phospholipid-binding protein, in SARS-CoV-2 attachment, internalization, and
replication has been discussed. In addition to the evidence from published
literature, we have performed in silico docking of viral spike glycoprotein and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with human AnxA2 to find the molecular interactions.
Overall, this review provides the molecular insights into a potential role of
AnxA2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and post-infection complications, especially
thrombosis, cytokine storm, and insulin resistance.
