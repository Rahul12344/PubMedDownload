BACKGROUND: Small poultry flock ownership has become a popular hobby in Europe
and North America in recent years but there is a general lack of information
regarding bird health and welfare. This retrospective analysis of routine
post-mortem cases of non-commercial anseriform poultry aimed at providing
information on causes of mortality mostly in relation to mortality events. For
this purpose, birds that were submitted for routine post-mortem diagnostics to
the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) in Sweden in 2011-2020 were
retrospectively reviewed to determine main causes of mortality.
RESULTS: Records from 79 necropsy submissions involving 120 birds (domestic ducks
n = 41, Muscovy ducks n = 45, hybrid ducks n = 2 and domestic geese n = 32) were 
retrieved and analysed. Most submissions (72.2%) represented flock disease events
and unexpected mortality was the most common cause of submission (70.9% of
submissions). Twenty-two submissions (27.8%) were referred by veterinarians.
There was a wide range of diagnoses of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies. 
Infectious causes of mortality included parasitic (19.2%), bacterial (13.3%),
fungal (10.0%) and viral infections (3.3%) (at bird level of all 120 birds). Some
of these infections such as duck virus enteritis (DVE), highly pathogenic
influenza (HPAI H5N8) in Muscovy ducks and leucocytozoonosis (Leucocytozoon sp.) 
in all three species were most likely acquired from contact with wild free-living
waterfowl. Generalised yeast infection (Muscovy duck disease) was diagnosed in
Muscovy ducks and in a Muscovy duck/domestic duck hybrid. Other diseases were
related to generalised noninfectious causes (27.5% of all birds) including
diseases such as kidney disease, amyloidosis, cardiac dilatation, reproductive
diseases and idiopathic inflammatory conditions. Nutritional or
management-related diseases were diagnosed in 14.2% of all birds including
rickets and gastrointestinal impaction/obstruction. Congenital/developmental,
neoplastic, toxic and traumatic causes of mortality were rare.
CONCLUSIONS: The information obtained in this study can be used to identify and
evaluate risks and help owners and veterinarians to prevent disease and provide
adequate veterinary care for non-commercial anseriform poultry.
