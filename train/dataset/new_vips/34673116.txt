COVID-19 is a multi-faceted disease ranging from asymptomatic to severely ill
condition that primarily affects the lungs and could advance to other organs as
well. It's causing factor, SARS-CoV-2 is recognized to develop robust
cell-mediated immunity that responsible to either control or exaggerate the
infection. As an important cell subset that control immune responses and are
significantly dysregulated in COVID-19, Tregs is proposed to be considered for
COVID-19 management. Among its hallmark, TNFR2 is recently recognized to play
important role in the function and survival of Tregs. This review gathers
available TNFR2 agonists to directly target Tregs as a potential approach to
overcome immune dysregulation that affect the severity in COVID-19. Furthermore, 
this review performs a rigid body docking of TNF-TNFR2 interaction and such
interaction with TNFR2 agonist to predict the optimal targeting approach.
