The approval of combination therapies with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens
has led to significant progress in the field of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
treatment. Although most patients treated with these agents achieve a virological
cure, resistance to DAAs is a major issue. The rapid emergence of
resistance-associated substitutions (RASs), in particular in the context of
incomplete drug pressure, has an impact on sustained virological response (SVR)
rates. Several RASs in NS3, NS5A and NS5B have been linked with reduced
susceptibility to DAAs. RAS vary based on HCV characteristics and the different
drug classes. DAA-resistant HCV variant haplotypes (RVs) are dominant in cases of
virological failure. Viruses with resistance to NS3-4A protease inhibitors are
only detected in the peripheral blood in a time frame ranging from weeks to
months following completion of treatment, whereas NS5A inhibitor-resistant
viruses may persist for years. Novel agents have been developed that demonstrate 
promising results in DAA-experienced patients. The recent approval of
broad-spectrum drug combinations with a high genetic barrier to resistance and
antiviral potency may overcome the problem of resistance.
