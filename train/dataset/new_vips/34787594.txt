Proposed for the first time by European Commission in May 2020, the
"NextGenerationEU" (NGEU) program is the European Union's most important effort
to address key issues relating to public health and healthcare, digital and
technological innovation, climate change, sustainable mobility, and key
sociocultural aspects. In addition, the NGEU represents a response to the
COVID-19 crisis through an extremely powerful financial intervention (over 800
billion euros). Italy is one of the main recipients of the NGEU plan's resources 
with almost 200 billion euros received in grants and loans. Implementation of the
NGEU in Italy will take place through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan
(NRRP). The NRRP not only describes how the NGEU resources will be used, but it
singles out crucial public law reforms in national legislation and organization. 
Unsurprisingly, public health intervention represents a major component of the
NRRP. Here we summarize and discuss the rules, regulations and perspective
envisaged by the NRRP to foster effective healthcare and to reshape the Italian
National Health System through the redesigning of primary care, enhanced
communication between hospital and community healthcare, and stronger
implementation of digital technologies in public health. (www.actabiomedica.it).
