This review examines the American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP)
Emergency Department COVID-19 Management Tool (2021). The authors and
contributors developed a tool to provide a framework to assist with severity
classification, risk assessment, diagnostic workup, disposition, and treatment of
patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the emergency department. By
utilizing the tool from this study, the emergency nurse practitioner can
confidently treat COVID-19 and reduce patient risks from unnecessary treatments
or unneeded admissions.
