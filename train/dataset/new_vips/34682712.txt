With limited US federal leadership on closing and re-opening strategies to
mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, cities and states were left to enact their own
policies. This article examines two key sets of policies-in-person learning in
public elementary schools and indoor dining-across 30 of the largest US cities in
the summer, fall, and winter of 2020. We review indoor dining and in-person
elementary education policy decisions between 1 May 2020 and 14 December 2020
across 30 US cities. We review the public health evidence, political power, and
jurisdictional challenges that cities faced, and the policy implications of these
factors. Overwhelmingly, indoor dining re-opened in cities while in-person
elementary schools were kept closed; indoor dining re-opened in all cities in
fall 2020, while only 40% of public elementary schools re-opened for in-person
instruction. Looking ahead to fully bringing students back for in-person
learning, and considering future potential community outbreaks, this
retrospective analysis can help inform city and state governments on policy
decisions around indoor dining and reopening/closing schools for in-person
learning.
