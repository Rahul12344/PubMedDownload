In March 2021, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) reported an avian
influenza A(H5N6) virus infection in a 5-year-old child identified through
sentinel surveillance. This was the first human A(H5N6) infection reported
outside of China. A multidisciplinary investigation undertook contact tracing and
enhanced human and animal surveillance in surrounding villages and live bird
markets. Seven Muscovy ducks tested positive for highly pathogenic avian
influenza A(H5N6) viruses. Sequenced viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4h and were 
closely related to viruses detected in poultry in Vietnam and to previous viruses
detected in Laos. Surveillance and coordinated outbreak response remain essential
to global health security.
