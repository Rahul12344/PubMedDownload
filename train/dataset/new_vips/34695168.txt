Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. PD
is pathologically characterized by the death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and
the accumulation of intracellular protein inclusions called Lewy bodies or Lewy
neurites. The major component of Lewy bodies is α-synuclein (α-syn). Prion-like
propagation of α-syn has emerged as a novel mechanism in the progression of PD.
This mechanism has been investigated to reveal factors that initiate Lewy
pathology with the aim of preventing further progression of PD. Here, we
demonstrate that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection can induce α-syn-associated
inclusion body formation in neurons which might act as a trigger for PD. The
inclusion bodies contained clustered organelles, including damaged mitochondria
with α-syn fibrils. α-Syn overexpression accelerated inclusion body formation and
induced more concentric inclusion bodies. In CVB3-infected mice brains, α-syn
aggregates were observed in the cell body of midbrain neurons. Additionally,
α-syn overexpression favored CVB3 replication and related cytotoxicity. α-Syn
transgenic mice had a low survival rate, enhanced CVB3 replication, and exhibited
neuronal cell death, including that of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra. These results may be attributed to distinct autophagy-related pathways
engaged by CVB3 and α-syn. This study elucidated the mechanism of Lewy body
formation and the pathogenesis of PD associated with CVB3 infection.
