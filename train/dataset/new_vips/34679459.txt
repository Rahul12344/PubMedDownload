Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial tumor with high prevalence in
southern China and Southeast Asia. NPC is well associated with the Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) 30 bp deletion by having its vital
role in increased tumorigenicity and decreased immune recognition of EBV-related 
tumors. This study developed an InnoPrimers-duplex qPCR for detection of NPC
blood circulating LMP1 30 bp deletion genetic biomarker for early diagnosis and
treatment response prediction of NPC patients. The analytical and diagnostic
evaluation and treatment response prediction were conducted using NPC patients'
whole blood (WB) and tissue samples and non-NPC cancer patients and healthy
individuals' WB samples. The assay was able to detect as low as 20 ag DNA per
reaction (equivalent to 173 copies) with high specificity against broad reference
microorganisms and archive NPC biopsy tissue and FNA samples. The diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. The 30 bp deletion
genetic biomarker was found to be a good prognostic biomarker associated with
overall clinical outcome of NPC WHO type III patients. This sensitive and
specific assay can help clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment response
prediction of NPC patients, which will enhance treatment outcome and lead to
better life-saving.
