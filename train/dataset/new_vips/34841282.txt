Objective: To confirm if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in semen of men with acute
COVID-19 and if their male hormone profile (testosterone, FSH, LH, SHBG, and FAI)
is adversely affected during the acute phase of infection and any relation to the
expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in human semen.
Design: Clinical study.
Setting: National University Hospital, Singapore.
Patients: Asian men aged 21 to 55 years old, who were admitted to National
University Hospital, Singapore with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab in the acute phase of the infection, within 2 
to 14 days of development of symptoms or contact history, were recruited for the 
study.
Interventions: Blood was collected in the morning to assess the male hormone
profile. Human semen were obtained by masturbation and sent to the molecular
diagnostic laboratories to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and assess the
expression of ACE2 andTMPRSS2.
Main Outcome Measures: Male hormone profile level, expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 
ACE2 andTMPRSS2 in human semen.
Results: 63 men of Asian ethnicities agreed to participate in the study. 65% of
recruited men had completely normal levels of male hormone profile. 27% were
noted to have higher LH levels between 6.6 to 16.1 IU/L (normal range 0.8 - 6.1
IU/L. 10% of men had higher FSH levels between 13.6 to 41.6 IU/L (normal range
1.5 - 12.4 IU/L) and all had normal testosterone levels. No SARS-CoV-2 RNA were
detected in all the human semen. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was undetectable 
in 26 samples, while 23 samples only had detectable expression of TMPRSS2, and 4 
for ACE2 only. The remaining 3 expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 virus could not be found in the semen of a cohort of
young to middle-aged Asian men with mild acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However,
there was detectable expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in semen, although not
causal, may be correlated to changes in male hormone profiles and male age.
