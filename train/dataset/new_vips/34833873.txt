The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the reason for worldwide pandemic, has 
already masked around 220 countries globally. This disease is induced by Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Arising environmental
stress, increase in the oxidative stress level, weak immunity and lack of
nutrition deteriorates the clinical status of the infected patients. Though
several researches are at its peak for understanding and bringing forward
effective therapeutics, yet there is no promising solution treating this disease 
directly. Medicinal plants and their active metabolites have always been
promising in treating many clinical complications since time immemorial. Mother
nature provides vivid chemical structures, which act multi-dimensionally all
alone or synergistically in mitigating several diseases. Their unique antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory activity with least side effects have made them more
effective candidate for pharmacological studies. These medicinal plants inhibit
attachment, encapsulation and replication of COVID-19 viruses by targeting
various signaling molecules such as angiotensin converting enzyme-2,
transmembrane serine protease 2, spike glycoprotein, main protease etc. This
property is re-examined and its potency is now used to improve the existing
global health crisis. This review is an attempt to focus various antiviral
activities of various noteworthy medicinal plants. Moreover, its implications as 
prophylactic or preventive in various secondary complications including
neurological, cardiovascular, acute kidney disease, liver disease are also
pinpointed in the present review. This knowledge will help emphasis on the
therapeutic developments for this novel coronavirus where it can be used as alone
or in combination with the repositioned drugs to combat COVID-19.
