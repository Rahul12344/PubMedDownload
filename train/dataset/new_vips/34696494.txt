Viral encephalitis is a rare but serious syndrome. In addition to DNA-encoded
herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus,
RNA-encoded viruses from the families of Flaviviridae, Rhabdoviridae and
Paramyxoviridae are important neurotropic viruses. Whereas in the periphery, the 
role of Toll-like receptors (TLR) during immune stimulation is well understood,
TLR functions within the CNS are less clear. On one hand, TLRs can affect the
physiology of neurons during neuronal progenitor cell differentiation and neurite
outgrowth, whereas under conditions of infection, the complex interplay between
TLR stimulated neurons, astrocytes and microglia is just on the verge of being
understood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about which TLRs
are expressed by cell subsets of the CNS. Furthermore, we specifically highlight 
functional implications of TLR stimulation in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. 
After briefly illuminating some examples of viral evasion strategies from TLR
signaling, we report on the current knowledge of primary immunodeficiencies in
TLR signaling and their consequences for viral encephalitis. Finally, we provide 
an outlook with examples of TLR agonist mediated intervention strategies and
potentiation of vaccine responses against neurotropic virus infections.
