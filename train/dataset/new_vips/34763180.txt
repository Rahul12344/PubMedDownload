Dysbiosis of the microbiome has been extensively studied in inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD). The roles of bacteria and fungi have been studied in detail, but 
viral communities, an important component of the microbiome, have been less
thoroughly investigated. Metagenomics provided a way to fill this gap by using
DNA sequencing to enumerate all viruses in a sample, termed the 'virome'. Such
methods have now been employed in several studies to assess associations between 
viral communities and IBD, yielding several commonly seen properties, including
an increase in tailed bacteriophage (Caudovirales) and a decrease in the
spherical Microviridae. Numerous studies of single human viruses have been
carried out, but no one virus has emerged as tightly associated, focusing
attention on whole virome communities and further factors. This review provides
an overview of research on the human virome in IBD, with emphasis on (1) dynamics
of the gut virome, (2) candidate mechanisms of virome alterations with disease,
(3) methods for studying the virome, and (4) potentially actionable implications 
of virome data.
