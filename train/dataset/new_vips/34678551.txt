OBJECTIVE: COVID-19-related social restrictions resulted in more loneliness, but 
whether this had further effects on mental health remains unclear. This study
aimed at examining the longitudinal effects of COVID-19-related loneliness on
mental health among older adults (aged ≥60 years) in Austria.
STUDY DESIGN: Survey data were gathered from a longitudinal observational study
among a random sample of older Austrian adults. The first survey wave was
conducted in May 2020 (N1 = 557), and the second wave was conducted in March 2021
(N2 = 463).
METHODS: Data collection was based on either computer-assisted web or telephone
interviewing. For statistical analysis, we used a cross-lagged panel analysis.
RESULTS: The results showed the perceived COVID-19-related social restrictions to
predict loneliness, which in turn predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms 10
months later.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related loneliness emerged as a risk factor for subsequent 
mental distress among older adults in Austria.
