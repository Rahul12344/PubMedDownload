BACKGROUND: Due to the high risk of COVID-19 transmission by asymptomatic
patients, the aim of this study was to evaluate chest computed tomography (CT)
and blood differential test as an additional COVID-19 screening tool for patients
undergoing elective or urgent surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The preoperative assessment of 118 patients hospitalized
from June to July 2020 included real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction RNA test before elective surgery or rapid antigen test in emergency
patients. The diagnostics were supplemented by chest CT and a complete blood
count with a blood smear in all patients.
RESULTS: None of the hospitalized patients had molecular, serological or
radiographic symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The chest CT revealed non-COVID-19
pathologies in a total of 48 patients. Leukocytosis and lymphopenia were typical 
of emergency patients.
CONCLUSION: Routine chest CT scans have no benefit in screening for potential
COVID-19 changes in asymptomatic patients. Blood differential tests are readily
available, which makes them more helpful in COVID-19 screening.
