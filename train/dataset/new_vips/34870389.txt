OBJECTIVE: Human cosavirus (HCosV) is a newly recognized virus that seems to be
partly related to nonpolio flaccid paralysis and acute gastroenteritis in
pediatric patients. However, the relationship between HCosV and diseases in
humans is unclear. To assess an investigation for the occurrence of HCosV among
pediatric patients involved in meningitis and encephalitis, we implemented a
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for detection and
quantification of HCosV in stool specimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a total of 160 cerebrospinal fluid samples 
from September 2019 to October 2020 were collected from presenting pediatric
patients with meningitis and encephalitis in a Karaj hospital, Iran. After viral 
RNA extraction, the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was
performed to amplify the 5'Un-Translated Region region of the HCosV genome and
viral load was analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 160 samples tested, the HCosV genomic RNA was detected in 2/160
(1.25%) of samples. The minimum viral load of HCosV was 3.5 × 103 copies/mL from 
4 years male patient. The maximum viral load was determined to be 2.4 × 105
copies/mL in one sample obtained from 3.5 years female patient.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documentation of HCosV detection in cerebrospinal 
fluid samples that better demonstrates relation of HCosV with neurologic diseases
including meningitis and encephalitis. Also, these results indicate that HCosV
has been circulating among Iranian pediatric patients.
