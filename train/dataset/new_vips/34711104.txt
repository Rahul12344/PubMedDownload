For more than a year, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a devastating effect on
global health. High-, low-, and middle-income countries are struggling to cope
with the spread of newer mutant strains of the virus. Delivery of acute stroke
care remains a priority despite the pandemic. In order to maintain the
time-dependent processes required to optimize delivery of intravenous
thrombolysis and endovascular therapy, most countries have reorganized
infrastructure to optimize human resources and critical services. Low-and-middle 
income countries (LMIC) have strained medical resources at baseline and often
face challenges in the delivery of stroke systems of care (SSOC). This position
statement aims to produce pragmatic recommendations on methods to preserve the
existing SSOC during COVID-19 in LMIC and propose best stroke practices that may 
be low cost but high impact and commonly shared across the world.
