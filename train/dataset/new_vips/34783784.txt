INTRODUCTION: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health workers has been
studied on an international level. However, mental health workers, who are also
called upon to address such ailments both in the general population as well as in
the health personnel, have not been asked about their experiences.
METHODS: Seventy mental health workers in five regions of Argentina were
interviewed between May and June 2020 regarding the subjective impact of changes 
in their work due to the pandemic. The responses were analyzed quantitatively and
qualitatively.
RESULTS: The results indicate emotions and experiences associated with a negative
impact, in connection to feelings of tiresome, uncertainty, fear, anguish and
anxiety and, to a lesser extent, some positive impacts are also described. More
than a third of participants mentioned mixed feelings (i.e., being surprised,
ambivalent, alert and sensitive).
CONCLUSIONS: The personnel who are supposed to support the rest of the health
workers are affected and experience having been relegated one more time to other 
aspects within the health care system. Focusing on learnings, having management
roles, counting on colleagues, and agreeing with macro policies could be
protective factors against the difficulties associated with the changes in work
that the pandemic has imposed.
