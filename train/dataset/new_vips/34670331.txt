Seasonal influenza A and B viruses represent a global concern. Antiviral drugs
are crucial to treat severe influenza in high-risk patients and prevent virus
spread in case of a pandemic. The emergence of viruses showing drug resistance,
in particular for the recently licensed polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, 
drives the need for developing alternative antivirals. The endonuclease activity 
residing in the N-terminal domain of the polymerase acidic protein (PAN) is
crucial for viral RNA synthesis and a validated target for drug design. Its
function can be impaired by molecules bearing a metal-binding pharmacophore (MBP)
able to coordinate the two divalent metal ions in the active site. In the present
work, the 2,3-dihydro-6,7-dihydroxy-1H-isoindol-1-one scaffold is explored for
the inhibition of influenza virus PA endonuclease. The structure-activity
relationship was analysed by modifying the substituents on the lipophilic moiety 
linked to the MBP. The new compounds exhibited nanomolar inhibitory activity in a
FRET-based enzymatic assay, and a few compounds (15-17, 21) offered inhibition in
the micromolar range, in a cell-based influenza virus polymerase assay. When
investigated against a panel of PA-mutant forms, compound 17 was shown to retain 
full activity against the baloxavir-resistant I38T mutant. This was corroborated 
by docking studies providing insight into the binding mode of this novel class of
PA inhibitors.
