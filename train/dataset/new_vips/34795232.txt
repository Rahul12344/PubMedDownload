Genes in SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in the order of Nidovirales are expressed
by a process of discontinuous transcription which is distinct from alternative
splicing in eukaryotes and is mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Here, we introduce the DISCONTINUOUS TRANSCRIPT ASSEMBLYproblem of finding
transcripts and their abundances given an alignment of paired-end short reads
under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. We
show, using simulations, that our method, JUMPER, outperforms existing methods
for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2
and MERS-CoV samples, we find that JUMPER not only identifies canonical
transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts
expression of non-canonical transcripts that are supported by subsequent
orthogonal analyses. Moreover, application of JUMPER on samples with and without 
treatment reveals viral drug response at the transcript level. As such,
JUMPER enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes under varying
conditions.
