Since the beginning of the 20th century, bacteriophages (phages), i.e., viruses
that infect bacteria, have been used as antimicrobial agents for treating various
infections. Phage preparations targeting a number of bacterial pathogens are
still in use in the post-Soviet states and are experiencing a revival in the
Western world. However, phages have never been used to treat diseases caused by
Bacteroides fragilis, the leading agent cultured in anaerobic abscesses and
postoperative peritonitis. Enterotoxin-producing strains of B. fragilis have been
associated with the development of inflammatory diarrhea and colorectal
carcinoma. In this study, we evaluated the molecular biosafety and antimicrobial 
properties of novel phage species vB_BfrS_VA7 (VA7) lysate, as well as its impact
on cytokine IL-8 production in an enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF)-infected
colonic epithelial cell (CEC) culture model. Compared to untreated infected
cells, the addition of phage VA7 to ETBF-infected CECs led to significantly
reduced bacterial counts and IL-8 levels. This in vitro study confirms the
potential of phage VA7 as an antibacterial agent for use in prophylaxis or in the
treatment of B. fragilis infections and associated colorectal carcinoma.
