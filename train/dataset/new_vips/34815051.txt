Circular Ribonucleic Acid (CircRNA) plays regulatory roles in many biological
processes, such as tumors and metabolic diseases. Due to the fact that circRNA is
more stable and conservative than linear RNA, circRNA has become a potential
biomarker in early clinical diagnosis and biomedical research. Therefore, the
quantification of circRNA expression level is of importance for understanding
their functions and their applications for disease diagnosis and treatment.
Nevertheless, due to the low abundance of circRNA, it is still a challenge for
the analysis of circRNA in cells. Herein, we proposed a sensitive detection
method for circRNA based on the T7 exonuclease-assisted cycling enzymatic
amplification. The fluorescent sensor was constructed by a hairpin molecular
beacon and T7 exonuclease. With the cycling enzymatic amplification process, this
sensor achieved the limit of detection of 1 pM with a good linear correlation in 
the range of 0-100 pM (R2 = 0.9891) using circBART2.2 as a model. Furthermore, we
applied the proposed method in the determination of circBART2.2 in cell lysates. 
The results demonstrated that this method has promising applications in early
diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection-related diseases using circRNA as
the biomarker.
