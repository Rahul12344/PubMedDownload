Moderate indoor relative humidity (RH) levels (i.e., 40%-60%) may minimize
transmission and viability of some viruses, maximize human immune function, and
minimize health risks from mold, yet uncertainties exist about typical RH levels 
in offices globally and about the potential independent impacts of RH levels on
workers' health. To examine this, we leveraged one year of indoor RH measurements
(which study participants could view in real time) in 43 office buildings in
China, India, Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and
corresponding self-report symptom data from 227 office workers in a subset of 32 
buildings. In the buildings in this study, 42% of measurements during 9:00 -
17:00 on weekdays were less than 40% RH and 7% exceeded 60% RH. Indoor RH levels 
tended to be lower in less tropical regions, in winter months, when outdoor RH or
temperature was low, and late in the workday. Furthermore, we also found
statistically significant evidence that higher indoor RH levels across the range 
of 14%-70% RH were associated with lower odds of reporting dryness or irritation 
of the throat and skin among females and unusual fatigue among males in models
adjusted for indoor temperature, country, and day of year.
