Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world and is of vital
importance to many countries. Various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria and
viruses constantly threaten rice plants and cause yield losses. Bacterial leaf
streak disease (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is one of
the most devastating rice diseases. However, most modern rice varieties are
susceptible to BLS. In this study, we applied the QTL-seq approach using an F2
population derived from the cross between IR62266 and Homcholasit (HSC) to
rapidly identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that confers resistance to BLS
caused by a Thai Xoc isolate, SP7-5. The results showed that a single genomic
region at the beginning of chromosome 5 was highly associated with resistance to 
BLS. The gene xa5 was considered a potential candidate gene in this region since 
most associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were within this gene. A
Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) marker was developed based on two
consecutive functional SNPs in xa5 and validated in six F2 populations inoculated
with another Thai Xoc isolate, 2NY2-2. The phenotypic variance explained by this 
marker (PVE) ranged from 59.04% to 70.84% in the six populations. These findings 
indicate that xa5 is a viable candidate gene for BLS resistance and may help in
breeding programs for BLS resistance.
