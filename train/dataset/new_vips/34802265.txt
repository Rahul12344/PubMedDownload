Men who have sex with men (MSM) make up the majority of new human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses among young people in China. Understanding
HIV transmission dynamics among the MSM population is, therefore, crucial for the
control and prevention of HIV infections, especially for some newly reported
genotypes of HIV. This study presents a metapopulation model considering the
impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to investigate the geographical spread 
of a hypothetically new genotype of HIV among MSM in Guangdong, China. We use
multiple data sources to construct this model to characterize the behavioural
dynamics underlying the spread of HIV within and between 21 prefecture-level
cities (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, etc.) in Guangdong province: the online
social network via a gay social networking app, the offline human mobility
network via the Baidu mobility website, and self-reported sexual behaviours among
MSM. Results show that PrEP initiation exponentially delays the occurrence of the
virus for the rest of the cities transmitted from the initial outbreak city; hubs
on the movement network, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan are at a higher 
risk of 'earliest' exposure to the new HIV genotype; most cities acquire the
virus directly from the initial outbreak city while others acquire the virus from
cities that are not initial outbreak locations and have relatively high
betweenness centralities, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shantou. This study
provides insights in predicting the geographical spread of a new genotype of HIV 
among an MSM population from different regions and assessing the importance of
prefecture-level cities in the control and prevention of HIV in Guangdong
province. This article is part of the theme issue 'Data science approach to
infectious disease surveillance'.
