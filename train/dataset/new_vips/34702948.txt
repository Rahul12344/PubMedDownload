Viruses need cells for their replication and, therefore, ways to hijack cellular 
functions. Mitochondria play fundamental roles within the cell in metabolism,
immunity and regulation of homeostasis due to which some viruses aim to alter
mitochondrial functions. Herein we show that the nucleoprotein (NP) of
arenaviruses enters the mitochondria of infected cells, affecting the
mitochondrial morphology. Reptarenaviruses cause boid inclusion body disease
(BIBD) that is characterized, especially in boas, by the formation of cytoplasmic
inclusion bodies (IBs) comprising reptarenavirus NP within the infected cells. We
initiated this study after observing electron-dense material reminiscent of IBs
within the mitochondria of reptarenavirus infected boid cell cultures in an
ultrastructural study. We employed immuno-electron microscopy to confirm that the
mitochondrial inclusions indeed contain reptarenavirus NP. Mutations to a
putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), identified via software
predictions in both mamm- and reptarenavirus NPs, did not affect the
mitochondrial localization of NP, suggesting that it occurs independently of MTS.
In support of MTS-independent translocation, we did not detect cleavage of the
putative MTSs of arenavirus NPs in reptilian or mammalian cells. Furthermore, in 
vitro translated NPs could not enter isolated mitochondria, suggesting that the
translocation requires cellular factors or conditions. Our findings suggest that 
MTS-independent mitochondrial translocation of NP is a shared feature among
arenaviruses. We speculate that by targeting the mitochondria arenaviruses aim to
alter mitochondrial metabolism and homeostasis or affect the cellular defense.
