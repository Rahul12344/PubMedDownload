Viruses are the potential cause of several diseases including novel corona
virus-19, flu, small pox, chicken pox, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe
acute respiratory syndrome etc. The objectives of this review article are to
summarize the reasons behind the epidemics caused by several emerging viruses and
bacteria, how to control the infection and preventive strategies. We have
explained the causes of epidemics along with their preventive measures, the
impact of lockdown on the health of people and the economy of a country. Several 
reports have revealed the transmission of infection during epidemic from the
contact of an infected person to the public that can be prevented by implementing
the lockdown by the government of a country. Though lockdown has been considered 
as one of the significant parameters to control the diseases, however, it has
some negative consequences on the health of people as they can be more prone to
other ailments like obesity, diabetes, cardiac problems etc. and drastic decline 
in the economy of a country. Therefore, the transmission of diseases can be
prevented by warning the people about the severity of diseases, avoiding their
public transportation, keeping themselves isolated, strictly following the
guidelines of lockdown and encouraging regular exercise.
