The rare and severe adverse effects associated with coronavirus disease of 2019
(COVID-19) vaccination have been under-appreciated, resulting in many instances
of inappropriate management. We describe the case of an elderly woman who
developed anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis with
pulmonary renal syndrome approximately 3 weeks after the first dose of COVID-19
mRNA vaccination (Moderna). Her nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test for
the COVID-19 RNA virus was negative. Gross hematuria, heavy proteinuria, acute
renal failure (serum creatinine up to 6.5 mg/dL), and hemoptysis coupled with a
marked increase in serum anti-myeloperoxidase-O antibody were observed. Renal
biopsy showed severe vasculitis with pauci-immune crescent glomerulonephritis.
The pulmonary hemorrhage was resolved and renal function improved following
combined plasma exchange and the administration of systemic steroids and
anti-CD20 therapy. The early examination of urinalysis and renal function may be 
crucial for identifying glomerulonephritis and acute renal failure in susceptible
patients after COVID-19 vaccination.
