Introduction: cervical precancer screening with same day treatment facilitates
maximization of benefits of secondary prevention of cervical cancer. This is
particularly important for women living with human immunodeficiency virus (WLHIV)
infection because of their exceptional risk for cervical cancer. The availability
of HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provide unique
opportunity for possible introduction "human papillomavirus (HPV) screening
followed by visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA) with same
day treatment of eligible patients". This study piloted this concept.
Methods: in this prospective, cohort study, 98 WLHIV had HPV and VIA screening
for cervical precancer lesions in a HIV clinic in Nigeria. Participants positive 
to HPV and/or VIA had biopsies from the visible lesions or quadrant of
transformation zone. Participants positive to VIA and/or HPV16 or HPV18/45 had
same-day thermal ablation treatment and the number of cases documented. The HPV, 
VIA and scenario of HPV followed by VIA results were compared with histologically
confirmed cervical lesion grade 2 or worse statistically.
Results: same day treatment was achieved in 95.0% of eligible cases.
Statistically, sensitivity and specificity of VIA was 25.0% and 50.0% and HPV had
95.5% and 75.0%, respectively. In the HPV screening with VIA triage, sensitivity 
dropped to 45.5% but specificity improved to 100.0%.
Conclusion: triaging HPV positive test with VIA for same-day treatment in
cervical precancer screening among PLWHIV looks feasible. The improved
specificity will reduce the overtreatment rate, loss to follow-up associated with
repeat clinic visits and improve completion of continuum of care.
