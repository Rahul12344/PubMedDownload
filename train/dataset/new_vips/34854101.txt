At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
raging worldwide, and the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 seriously
threatens the life and health of all humankind. There is no specific medicine for
novel coronavirus yet. So, laboratory diagnoses of novel coronavirus as soon as
possible and isolation of the source of infection play a vital role in preventing
and controlling the epidemic. Therefore, selecting appropriate detection
techniques and methods is particularly important to improve the efficiency of
disease diagnosis and treatment and to curb the outbreak of infectious diseases. 
In this paper, virus nucleic acid, protein, and serum immunology were reviewed to
provide a reference for further developing virus detection technology to provide 
better prevention and treatment strategies and research ideas for clinicians and 
researchers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
