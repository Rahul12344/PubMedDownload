Aquaculture is a rapidly growing food production sector. Fish farmers are
experiencing increasing problems with antibiotic resistance when fighting against
pathogenic bacteria such as Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, the
causative agent of furunculosis. Phage therapy may provide an alternative, but
effective use must be determined. Here, we studied the inhibition of A.
salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains by five phages (HER98 [44RR2.8t.2], HER110
[65.2], SW69-9, L9-6 and Riv-10) used individually or as combinations of two to
five phages. A particular combination of four phages (HER98 [44RR2.8t.2], SW69-9,
Riv-10, and HER110 [65.2]) was found to be the most effective when used at an
initial multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 against the A. salmonicida subsp.
salmonicida strain 01-B526. The same phage cocktail is effective against other
strains except those bearing a prophage (named Prophage 3), which is present in
2/3 of the strains from the province of Quebec. To confirm the impact of this
prophage, we tested the effectiveness of the same cocktail on strains that were
either cured or lysogenized with Prophage 3. While the parental strains were
sensitive to the phage cocktail, the lysogenized ones were much less sensitive.
These data indicate that the prophage content of A. salmonicida subsp.
salmonicida can affect the efficacy of a cocktail of virulent phages for phage
therapy purposes.
