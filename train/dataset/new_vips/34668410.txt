The aim of this article was to evaluate the correlation between the number of
voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests conducted and public awareness
according to Internet search volumes from Google Trends. We used bivariate
correlations to assess the relationship between the Internet search frequency for
each term of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the number of 
HIV tests, by time series and prefecture. We observed positive correlations
between search frequencies of the terms HIV and AIDS and the number of HIV tests 
in both time-series analysis (HIV: r = 0.65, P < .001; AIDS: r = 0.73, P < .001) 
and analysis by prefecture (HIV: r = 0.71, P < .001; AIDS: r = 0.40, P = .001).
The findings of this study indicate that the current stagnant number of HIV tests
conducted in Japan reflects declining public awareness regarding HIV.
