Recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic should be a lesson learnt with
respect to the effort we have to invest in the development of new strategies for 
the treatment of viral diseases, along with their cheap, easy, sensitive, and
selective detection. Since we live in a globalized world where just hours can
play a crucial role in the spread of a virus, its detection must be as quick as
possible. Thanks to their chemical stability, photostability, and superior
biocompatibility, carbon dots are a kind of nanomaterial showing great potential 
in both the detection of various virus strains and a broad-spectrum antiviral
therapy. The biosensing and antiviral properties of carbon dots can be tuned by
the selection of synthesis precursors as well as by easy post-synthetic
functionalization. In this review, we will first summarize current options of
virus detection utilizing carbon dots by either electrochemical or optical
biosensing approaches. Secondly, we will cover and share the up-to-date knowledge
of carbon dots' antiviral properties, which showed promising activity against
various types of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms of their antiviral 
actions will be further adressed as well. Finally, we will discuss the advantages
and distadvantages of the use of carbon dots in the tangled battle against viral 
infections in order to provide valuable informations for further research and
development of new virus biosensors and antiviral therapeutics.
