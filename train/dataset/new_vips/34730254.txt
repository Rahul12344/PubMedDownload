Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that varies
in severity from mild to severe/fatal. Several risk factors for severe disease
have been identified, notably age, male sex, and pre-existing conditions such as 
diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Several advancements in clinical care have
been achieved over the past year, including the use of corticosteroids (e.g.,
corticosteroids) and other immune-modulatory treatments that have now become
standard of care for patients with acute severe COVID-19. While the understanding
of the mechanisms that underlie increased disease severity with age has improved 
over the past few months, it remains incomplete. Furthermore, the molecular
impact of corticosteroid treatment on host response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection
has not been investigated. In this study, a cross-sectional and longitudinal
analysis of Ab, soluble immune mediators, and transcriptional responses in young 
(65 ≤ years) and aged (≥ 65 years) diabetic males with obesity hospitalized with 
acute severe COVID-19 was conducted. Additionally, the transcriptional profiles
in samples obtained before and after corticosteroids became standard of care were
compared. The analysis indicates that severe COVID-19 is characterized by robust 
Ab responses, heightened systemic inflammation, increased expression of genes
related to inflammatory and pro-apoptotic processes, and reduced expression of
those important for adaptive immunity regardless of age. In contrast, COVID-19
patients receiving steroids did not show high levels of systemic immune mediators
and lacked transcriptional indicators of heightened inflammatory and apoptotic
responses. Overall, these data suggest that inflammation and cell death are key
drivers of severe COVID-19 pathogenesis in the absence of corticosteroid therapy.
