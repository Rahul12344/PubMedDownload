BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on resident training 
in different branches and affected the physical and mental health of frontline
residents adversely. This nationwide cross-sectional survey aimed to investigate 
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine residents in Turkey,
including the levels of depression and burnout.
METHODS: An anonymous online survey was distributed to all family medicine
residents via e-mail and a web link between 28.11.2020 and 12.12.2020.
Information on sociodemographic data and the residency programme were evaluated, 
and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined using the
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Burnout Measure-Short Version
(BMS) respectively.
RESULTS: Although the weekly average working hours of the 477 respondents
increased significantly during the pandemic (p < 0.05), the average weekly
working time in the Family Medicine (FM) outpatient clinic decreased. The
greatest concern of 58.3% of the residents was fear of transmitting COVID-19 to
their family members. 90.2% of the residents stated that training programmes were
negatively or very negatively affected. According to PHQ-9 scores, 15.7% of
residents had moderately severe, and 14.9% severe depression. The BMS scores of
the residents demonstrated that 24.1% had a very severe burnout problem, and
23.3% should seek professional help as soon as possible. Being single, having no 
children, female gender, lack of personal protective equipments and increased
contact time with COVID-19 patients were associated with higher scores in the
depression and burnout scales (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on training
programmes for FM residents, who are at the forefront of the pandemic in Turkey, 
and this situation is closely related to depression and burnout. Due to the
unpredictability of the pandemic, long-term plans should be made for the training
needs of residents in order to protect their physical and mental health.
