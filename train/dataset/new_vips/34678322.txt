Zika virus (ZIKV) infection represents an emerging infectious disease that poses 
an increasing threat to human health, especially after the ZIKV outbreak in
Brazil in 2015. Unfortunately, there continues to be a lack of highly effective
antiviral drugs or vaccines against ZIKV. In this study, we expressed the ZIKV
envelope protein domain III (ZIKV EDIII) in E. coli strain BL21. The purified
recombinant protein was used to immunize mice to produce monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs). After 6 screening and 5 subcloning cycles, 10 monoclonal cell lines that 
stably produced antibodies, termed 2F5, 5B8, 6G6, 7E12, 8B6, 17E6, 19E7, 20F4,
26G6, and 37E6, were identified. The mAb 8B6 could neutralize ZIKV and recognize 
the ZIKV EDIII epitope (GRLITANPVITESTE). Another 9 mAbs did not exhibit
neutralizing activity; however, they could specifically recognize the ZIKV EDIII 
and ZIKV lysate, suggesting their potential use in the diagnosis of ZIKV.
