Dengue virus (DENV), like other viruses, closely interacts with the host cell
machinery to complete its life cycle. Over the course of infection, DENV
interacts with several host factors with pro-viral activities to support its
infection. Meanwhile, it has to evade or counteract host factors with anti-viral 
activities which inhibit its infection. These molecular virus-host interactions
play a crucial role in determining the success of DENV infection. Deciphering
such interactions is thus paramount to understanding viral fitness in its natural
hosts. While DENV-mammalian host interactions have been extensively studied, not 
much has been done to characterize DENV-mosquito host interactions despite its
importance in controlling DENV transmission. Here, to provide a snapshot of our
current understanding of DENV-mosquito interactions, we review the literature
that identified host factors and cellular processes related to DENV infection in 
its mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, with a particular focus
on DENV-mosquito omics studies. This knowledge provides fundamental insights into
the DENV life cycle, and could contribute to the development of novel antiviral
strategies.
