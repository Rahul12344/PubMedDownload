OBJECTIVE: To analyze changes in primary care utilization as a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic. Swedish national register data from 2019 to 2020 on
utilization of services were used to compare overall utilization levels and
across types of contacts and patient groups. A specific objective was to assess
the extent to which remote types of patient consultations were able to compensate
for any observed fall in on-site visits. Data were stratified by sex and age to
investigate any demographic pattern.
RESULTS: Findings show significant reductions in overall utilization of services 
as the pandemic occurred in the first quarter of 2020. On-site visits fell during
the first wave of the pandemic and rebounded thereafter. Patients over 65 years
of age appear to have reduced utilization to a larger extent compared with
younger groups. Simultaneously, remote contacts increased from around 12% before 
the pandemic to 17% of the total number of consultations. However, the net effect
of changes in service utilization suggests an overall reduction of around 12
percent in the number of primary care consultations as a result of the pandemic. 
No differences between men and women were observed. Further research will
continue to monitor changes in primary care utilization as the pandemic
continues.
