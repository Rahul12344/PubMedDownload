The evolution of human-virus associations is usually reconstructed from
contemporary patterns of genomic diversity. An intriguing, though still rarely
implemented, alternative is to search for the genetic material of viruses in
archeological and medical archive specimens to document evolution as it happened.
In this chapter, we present lessons from ancient DNA research and incorporate
insights from virology to explore the potential range of applications and likely 
limitations of archeovirological approaches. We also highlight the numerous
questions archeovirology will hopefully allow us to tackle in the near future,
and the main expected roadblocks to these avenues of research.
