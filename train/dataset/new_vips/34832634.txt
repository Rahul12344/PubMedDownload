The high antigenic diversity of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) means that
porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a challenge for the global pig industry.
Understanding the circulation of the virus to determine an optimal vaccine
strategy is important in controlling the disease. In this study, we describe the 
genetic diversity of circulating PEDV based on the full sequences of spike genes 
of eight positive samples collected in Vietnam since 2018. Additionally, we
developed a live attenuated vaccine candidate from the cell-adapted PEDV2 strain,
which was continuously passaged until level 103 in VERO-CCL81 cells. PEDV2-p103, 
which belongs to the emerging non-S INDEL cluster, exhibited low virus shedding, 
did not induce lesions in the small intestine of challenged piglets, and had a
high titer in the VERO-CCL81 cell at 48 h post-infection. These results suggest
that the PEDV2-p103 strain could be a potential oral attenuated vaccine, and its 
immunogenicity and efficacy should be further assessed through in vivo tests.
