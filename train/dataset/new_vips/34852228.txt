Passive antibody therapy and vectored antibody gene delivery (VAGD) in particular
offer an innovative approach to combat persistent viral diseases. Here, we
exploit a small animal model to investigate synergies of VAGD with the host's
endogenous immune defense for treating chronic viral infection. An
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivering the lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV)-neutralizing antibody KL25 (AAV-KL25) establishes protective
antibody titers for >200 days. When therapeutically administered to chronically
infected immunocompetent wild-type mice, AAV-KL25 affords sustained viral load
control. In contrast, viral mutational escape thwarts therapeutic AAV-KL25
effects when mice are unable to mount LCMV-specific antibody responses or lack
CD8+ T cells. VAGD augments antiviral germinal center B cell and
antibody-secreting cell responses and reduces inhibitory receptor expression on
antiviral CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that VAGD fortifies host immune
defense and synergizes with B cell and CD8 T cell responses to restore immune
control of chronic viral infection.
