OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this article was to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection
among pregnant women during the wild-type and Alpha-variant periods in Italy. The
secondary aim was to compare the impact of the virus variants on the severity of 
maternal and perinatal outcomes.
DESIGN: National population-based prospective cohort study.
SETTING: A total of 315 Italian maternity hospitals.
SAMPLE: A cohort of 3306 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days 
of hospital admission.
METHODS: Cases were prospectively reported by trained clinicians for each
participating maternity unit. Data were described by univariate and multivariate 
analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 pneumonia, ventilatory support, intensive care
unit (ICU) admission, mode of delivery, preterm birth, stillbirth, and maternal
and neonatal mortality.
RESULTS: We found that 64.3% of the cohort was asymptomatic, 12.8% developed
COVID-19 pneumonia and 3.3% required ventilatory support and/or ICU admission.
Maternal age of 30-34 years (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.87) and ≥35 years (OR 1.62,
95% CI 1.23-2.13), citizenship of countries with high migration pressure
(OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.36-2.25), previous comorbidities (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.13-1.98)
and obesity (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.29-2.27) were all associated with a higher
occurrence of pneumonia. The preterm birth rate was 11.1%. In comparison with the
pre-pandemic period, stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths remained
stable. The need for ventilatory support and/or ICU admission among women with
pneumonia increased during the Alpha-variant period compared with the wild-type
period (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.99-5.28).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a low risk of severe COVID-19
disease among pregnant women and with rare adverse perinatal outcomes. During the
Alpha-variant period there was a significant increase of severe COVID-19 illness.
Further research is needed to describe the impact of different SARS-CoV-2 viral
strains on maternal and perinatal outcomes.
