Background: The duration of immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infected people remains
unclear. Neutralizing antibody responses are the best available correlate of
protection against re-infection. Recent studies estimated that the correlate of
50% protection from re-infection was 20% of the mean convalescent neutralizing
antibody titre.
Methods: We collected sera from a cohort of 124 individuals with RT-PCR confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infections from Prince of Wales Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Queen Mary Hospitals of the Hospital Authority of
Hong Kong, for periods up to 386 days after symptom onset and tested these for
antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using 50% virus plaque reduction neutralization tests
(PRNT50), surrogate neutralization tests and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) 
binding antibody. Patients were recruited from 21 January 2020 to 16 February
2021 and follow-up samples were collected until 9th March 2021.
Findings: Because the rate of antibody waning slows with time, we fitted lines of
decay to 115 sera from 62 patients collected beyond 90 days after symptom onset
and estimate that PRNT50 antibody will remain detectable for around 1,717 days
after symptom onset and that levels conferring 50% protection will be maintained 
for around 990 days post-symptom onset, in symptomatic patients. This would
potentially be affected by emerging virus variants. PRNT titres wane faster in
children. There was a high level of correlation between PRNT50 antibody titers
and the % of inhibition in surrogate virus neutralization tests.
Interpretation: The data suggest that symptomatic COVID-19 disease is followed by
relatively long-lived protection from re-infection by antigenically similar
viruses.
