The prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients has motivated research communities to
uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis also on a regional level. In this
work, we aimed to understand the immunological dynamics of severe COVID-19
patients with different degrees of illness, and upon long-term recovery. We
analyzed immune cellular subsets and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody isotypes of 66 
COVID-19 patients admitted to the Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile, which
were categorized according to the WHO ten-point clinical progression score. These
included 29 moderate patients (score 4-5) and 37 severe patients under either
high flow oxygen nasal cannula (18 patients, score 6), or invasive mechanical
ventilation (19 patients, score 7-9), plus 28 convalescent patients and 28
healthy controls. Furthermore, six severe patients that recovered from the
disease were longitudinally followed over 300 days. Our data indicate that severe
COVID-19 patients display increased frequencies of plasmablasts, activated T
cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies compared to moderate and convalescent
patients. Remarkably, within the severe COVID-19 group, patients rapidly
progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show higher frequencies of
plasmablasts, monocytes, eosinophils, Th1 cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than 
patients under high flow oxygen nasal cannula. These findings demonstrate that
severe COVID-19 patients progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show a 
distinctive type of immunity. In addition, patients that recover from severe
COVID-19 begin to regain normal proportions of immune cells 100 days after
hospital discharge and maintain high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG throughout
the study, which is an indicative sign of immunological memory. Thus, this work
can provide useful information to better understand the diverse outcomes of
severe COVID-19 pathogenesis.
