Recently emerged coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 is considered as a 
serious threat for human health. Due to unavailable specific drugs for this
virus, there is an urgent need for supportive cares. Epigenetic immune boosting
approaches and developing anti-inflammatory agents by gut-associated bioactive
macronutrients can be plausible protective cares for COVID-19. Suitable intake of
bioactive macronutrients including prebiotics, fatty acids, proteins and
branched-chain amino acids may result in anti-viral responses through modulating 
macrophages and dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors, decreasing viral load,
inactivating the enveloped viruses, increasing the anti-inflammatory metabolites 
and inhibiting the proliferation of microbial organisms. Bioactive macronutrients
may help in promotion of immunological responses and recovery acceleration
against Covid-19. This review focuses on the mechanisms of bioactive
macronutrients and related clinical trials on enveloped viruses with emphasis on 
gut-microbiome-immune axis. Macronutrients and this axis may be conducive
strategies to protect host against the viral infection.
