To reveal the complex relationships between quarantine and mental health during
COVID-19, a meta-analysis was conducted involving 34 articles and a total sample 
size of 134,061. As the relationship between quarantine and mental health was
found to be affected by the sampling objects and national factors, a
random-effects model was applied for the meta-analysis. First, a heterogeneity
test and sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine whether there was
heterogeneity in the samples, after which a funnel chart, Rosenthal's Classic
Fail-safe N test and Egger's test were applied to further determine whether there
was publication bias in the included samples. Finally, a sub-group test was used 
to explore whether the sampling group and the country of origin had a moderating 
effect on the relationship between quarantine and mental health, which revealed
that the relationship between quarantine and mental health was regulated and
influenced by the sampled objects but was not affected by the country categories.
The results indicated that: COVID-19 quarantine had varying impacts on individual
anxiety, depression, and psychological stress; different groups had different
regulatory effects on the relationship between quarantine and mental health; and 
country of origin had no moderating effect on quarantine and
psychology.BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is the most important topic in 2020, and mass
quarantine is the measures for pandemic prevention and control around the world
since 2020. To explore the relationships between mass quarantine and mental
health during COVID-19, a meta-analysis was conducted involving 28 articles and a
total sample size of 134,061.
METHOD: As the relationship between mass quarantine and mental health was found
to be affected by the sampling objects and national factors, a random-effects
model was applied for the meta-analysis. First, a heterogeneity test and
sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine whether there was heterogeneity 
in the samples, after which a funnel chart, Rosenthal's Classic Fail-safe N test 
and Egger's test were applied to further determine whether there was publication 
bias in the included samples. Finally, a sub-group test was used to explore
whether the sampling group and the country of origin had a moderating effect on
the relationship between mass quarantine and mental health.
RESULTS: COVID-19 quarantine had varying impacts on individual anxiety,
depression, and psychological stress; different groups had different regulatory
effects on the relationship between quarantine and mental health; and country of 
origin had no moderating effect on quarantine and mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: This study employed a meta-analysis to examine the relationships
between the COVID-19 pandemic mass quarantine measures and mental health factors 
such as anxiety, depression and stress, from which it was found that influence of
quarantine on anxiety was stronger, the relationship between quarantine and
mental health was affected by the sampled object, and there was no significant
relationship between quarantine and country of origin in the sample population.
