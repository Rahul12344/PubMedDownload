The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged 
to be the reason behind the COVID-19 pandemic. It was discovered in Wuhan, China 
and then began spreading around the world, impacting the health of millions.
Efforts for treatment have been hampered as there are no antiviral drugs that are
effective against this virus. In the present study, we have explored the
phytochemical constituents of Salvia plebeia R. Br., in terms of its binding
affinity by targeting COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) using computational analysis.
Molecular docking analysis was performed using PyRx software. The ADMET and
drug-likeness properties of the top 10 compounds showing binding affinity greater
than or equal to - 8.0 kcal/mol were analysed using pkCSM and DruLiTo,
respectively. Based on the docking studies, it was confirmed that Rutin and
Plebeiosides B were the most potent inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2
with the best binding affinities of - 9.1 kcal/mol and - 8.9 kcal/mol,
respectively. Further, the two compounds were analysed by studying their
biological activity using the PASS webserver. Molecular dynamics simulation
analysis was performed for the selected protein-ligand complexes to confirm their
stability at 300 ns. MM-PBSA provided the basis for analyzing the affinity of the
phytochemicals towards Mpro by calculating the binding energy, and secondary
structure analysis indicated the stability of protease structure when it is bound
to Rutin and Plebeiosides B. Altogether, the study identifies Rutin and
Plebeiosides B to be potent Mpro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.Supplementary
