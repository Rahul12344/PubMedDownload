The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, is rapidly spreading and severely 
straining the capacities of public health communities and systems around the
world. Therefore, accurate, rapid, and robust diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are
crucial to prevent further spread of the infection, alleviate the burden on
healthcare and diagnostic facilities, and ensure timely therapeutic intervention.
To date, several detection methods based on nucleic acid amplification have been 
developed for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. Despite the myriad 
of advancements in the detection methods for SARS-CoV-2, rapid sample preparation
methods for RNA extraction from viruses have rarely been explored. Here, we
report a rapid COVID-19 molecular diagnostic system that combines a self-powered 
sample preparation assay and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based 
naked-eye detection method for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2.
The self-powered sample preparation assay with a hydrophilic polyvinylidene
fluoride filter and dimethyl pimelimidate can be operated by hand, without the
use of any sophisticated instrumentation, similar to the reverse transcription
(RT)-LAMP-based lateral flow assay for the naked-eye detection of SARS-CoV-2. The
COVID-19 molecular diagnostic system enriches the virus population, extracts and 
amplifies the target RNA, and detects SARS-CoV-2 within 60 min. We validated the 
accuracy of the system by using 23 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. We envision
that this proposed system will enable simple, facile, efficient, and inexpensive 
diagnosis of COVID-19 at home and the clinic as a pre-screening platform to
reduce the burden on the medical staff in this pandemic era.
