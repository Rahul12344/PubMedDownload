BACKGROUND: Long-term symptoms after acute COVID-19 are highly debated.
Nevertheless, data on long-term symptoms of COVID-19 in healthcare workers are
scarce.
METHODS: We assessed frequency and risk factors of persisting symptoms in a
retrospective cohort of healthcare workers infected with SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: Persistent symptoms at 3 and 12 months were reported by 26.5% and 13.5% 
of participants, respectively. Most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue,
impaired sense of taste or smell and general weakness. A history of depression or
state of exhaustion, pre-existing lung disease and older age were associated with
persisting symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a relevant proportion of healthcare workers with
mild COVID-19 report persisting symptoms over 3 and 12 months. Although in the
majority of cases symptoms are mild, this study highlights the need for further
research into causes and therapy.
