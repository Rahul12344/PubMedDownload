Dengue virus (DENV) causes about 50-100 million cases per year worldwide.
However, there is still a big challenge in developing antiviral drugs against
DENV infection. Some derivatives of alkaloid (-)-cytisine, like other alkaloid
analogs, have been proposed for their antiviral potential. This study
investigated antiviral activity and mechanisms of the cytisine derivatives, and
discovered the structure-activity relationship against DENV. The antiviral assays
were performed using one strain of DENV1 and DENV2, and two cell lines Vero E6
and A549. The structure-activity relationship of the effective compounds was also
evaluated using combination of time-of-addition/removal assay and molecular
docking. Compounds 3, 4, 12 (N-allylcytisine-3-thiocarbamide), 16, and 20
exhibited the high antiviral activity with IC50 values of lower than 3 μM against
DENV1 and DENV2. Of them, the derivative 12 showed the highest antiviral
activities against DENV1 (IC50 = 0.14 μM) and DENV-2 (IC50 = <0.1 μM), exhibiting
the potent inhibition on virus attachment and entry stages. Meanwhile, the
compounds 4 and 20 had a strong inhibition at the post-entry stage
(IC50 = <0.1 μM). A correlation between the experimental pIC50 values and
predicted pKi calculated by docking of compounds into DENV E protein was
significant, correlating with the impact of compound 12 on the attachment stage, 
but compounds 4, and 20 on post-entry stage. The results provided the insight
into the directions of synthetic modifications of starting (-)-cytisine as the
inhibitors of DENV E protein at attachment and entry stages of DENV life cycle.
