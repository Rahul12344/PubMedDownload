INTRODUCTION: Seasonal influenza infects millions annually in Europe. Annual
influenza vaccination is the most effective measure to reduce the risk of
infection and its complications, especially among young children and older
adults.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed adverse event (AE) frequency after receiving GSK's
inactivated quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4).
METHODS: A passive enhanced safety surveillance study was conducted in Belgium,
Germany, and Spain. Adults who had received GSK's IIV4 or the
parent(s)/guardian(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) of children given the 
vaccine were invited to complete an adverse drug reaction (ADR) card to document 
AEs experienced within 7 days post vaccination.
RESULTS: A total of 1082 participants (51.6% females) received GSK's IIV4,
including 115 children < 9 years of age who received two doses. The ADR card
return rate was 97.0% (n = 1049) after dose 1 and 100% (n = 115) after dose 2.
All participants in Belgium and Germany were adults. In Spain, 71.2% were
children. After dose 1, 39.2% reported one or more AE. The most frequent AEs
category was "general disorders and administration site conditions" (GDASC). AEs 
were most frequently reported in adults aged 18-65 years (47.2%), followed by
children aged 6 months-17 years (38.1%), and adults aged > 65 years (31.6%).
After dose 2, 7.8% reported one or more AE, and GDASC was again the most frequent
AE category. There were no serious AEs related to GSK's IIV4 within 7 days post
vaccination.
CONCLUSION: No serious AEs related to GSK's IIV4 within 7 days post vaccination
were reported. This study supports the favourable risk-benefit safety profile of 
GSK's IIV4.

plain-language-summary: Seasonal influenza infects millions annually in Europe,
especially young children and older adults. Annual influenza vaccination is the
most effective measure to reduce the risk of infection and its complications. As 
the wild influenza virus strains change every year, the composition of the
influenza vaccine changes as well. Since the vaccine is produced in the same way 
over the years, extensive safety studies are no longer required by regulatory
authorities. Instead, monitoring of any unwanted medical incidents (adverse
events) after vaccination is required. For the 2019/2020 season, we monitored the
adverse events reported by a representative sample of people in Belgium, Germany,
and Spain within 7 days after receiving GSK's seasonal influenza vaccine.Of the
1082 people who received the first dose of the vaccine, 39% reported at least one
adverse event, such as pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, fever,
headache, or dizziness. A total of 115 children under 9 years of age received two
doses 4 weeks apart. After their second dose, few of these children (8%) reported
adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were fever, swelling and pain at
the injection site, runny nose, or irritability. No serious adverse events were
reported after either the first or second dose.No serious adverse events related 
to GSK’s seasonal influenza vaccine within the 7 days after vaccination were
reported. This study supports the favourable risk–benefit safety profile of GSK's
seasonal influenza vaccine.
