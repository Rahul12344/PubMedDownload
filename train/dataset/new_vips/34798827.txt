BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be
associated with myocardial injury. Identification of at-risk patients and
mechanisms underlying cardiac involvement in COVID-19 remains unclear. During
hospitalization for COVID-19, high troponin level has been found to be an
independent variable associated with in-hospital mortality and a greater risk of 
complications. Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities could be a useful tool to
identify patients at risk of poor prognostic. The aim of our study was to assess 
if specific ECGs patterns could be related with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19
patients presenting to the ED in a European country.
METHODS: From February 1st to May 31st, 2020, we conducted a multicenter study in
three hospitals in France. We included adult patients (≥ 18 years old) who
visited the ED during the study period, with ECG performed at ED admission and
diagnosed with COVID-19. Demographic, comorbidities, drug exposures, signs and
symptoms presented, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical
records using a standardized data collection form. The relationship between ECG
abnormalities and in-hospital mortality was assessed using univariate and
multivariable logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: An ECG was performed on 275 patients who presented to the ED. Most of
the ECGs were in normal sinus rhythm (87%), and 26 (10%) patients had atrial
fibrillation/flutter on ECG at ED admission. Repolarization abnormalities
represented the most common findings reported in the population (40%), with
negative T waves representing 21% of all abnormalities. We found that abnormal
axis (adjusted odds ratio: 3.9 [95% CI, 1.1-11.5], p = 0.02), and left bundle
branch block (adjusted odds ratio: 7.1 [95% CI, 1.9-25.1], p = 0.002) were
significantly associated with in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: ECG performed at ED admission may be useful to predict death in
COVID-19 patients. Our data suggest that the presence of abnormal axis and left
bundle branch block on ECG indicated a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in
COVID-19 patients who presented to the ED. We also confirmed that ST segment
elevation was rare in COVID-19 patients.
