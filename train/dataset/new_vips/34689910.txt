Infectious and parasitic diseases plague honey bees similarly to that of other
food animal species. A complete understanding of each is necessary for a honey
bee veterinarian to establish a strong veterinarian-client-patient relationship
and make sound treatment recommendations. Control and management of these
diseases is paramount to success of the colony and apiary operation. The
following is not meant to be an end-all of information on each of the common
honey bee diseases but more so a review and photo-documentation of each. A deeper
understanding can be established through various other sources previously
published and referenced in this document.
