This Special Issue, entitled "Emerging Materials for Mixed-Matrix Membranes" was 
introduced to cover the recent progress in the development of materials for
mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) with potential application in fields such as sea
water desalination, gas separation, pharmaceutical separation, wastewater
treatment and the removal of pathogenic (viruses and bacteria) microorganisms as 
well as solvents and resource recovery [...].
