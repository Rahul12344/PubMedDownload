Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are hematophagous arthropod
vectors that transmit epizootic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses).
Arboviruses are recognized as causes of pregnancy loss, encephalomyelitis, and
congenital malformations in ruminants. Therefore, continuous monitoring and
control of Culicoides, which causes significant damage to industrial animals are 
necessary. We performed attraction and repellent tests in Culicoides using
various essential oils, cow dung, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Culicoides tended to 
move more to cow dung (60.8%, P<0.0001) and CO2 (63.8%, P<0.01). To the essential
oils as repellents, 26.1% (P<0.0001), 18.7% (P<0.001), and 25.5% (P<0.01) of the 
Culicoides moved to the lavender, lemongrass, and eucalyptus chamber,
respectively. The Culicoides that moved to the 3 essential oils chambers showed
markedly low activity. Collectively, it was showed that Culicoides tended to be
attractive to cow dung and CO2, and repellent from the 3 essential oils.
