Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against pathogens. This process
is modulated by multiple antiviral protein modifications, such as phosphorylation
and ubiquitination. Here, we showed that cellular S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 
(GSNOR) is actively involved in innate immunity activation. GSNOR deficiency in
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and RAW264.7 macrophages reduced the antiviral
innate immune response and facilitated herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. Concordantly, HSV-1 infection in
Gsnor-/- mice and wild-type mice with GSNOR being inhibited by N6022 resulted in 
higher mortality relative to the respective controls, together with severe
infiltration of immune cells in the lungs. Mechanistically, GSNOR deficiency
enhanced cellular TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) protein S-nitrosation at the
Cys423 site and inhibited TBK1 kinase activity, resulting in reduced interferon
production for antiviral responses. Our study indicated that GSNOR is a critical 
regulator of antiviral responses and S-nitrosation is actively involved in innate
immunity.
