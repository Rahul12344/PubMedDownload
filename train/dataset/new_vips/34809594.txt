BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the number of patients admitted
to the intensive care unit (ICU) is still increasing. The aim of our article is
to estimate which of the conventional ICU mortality risk scores is the most
accurate at predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients and to determine how these 
scores can be used in combination with the 4C Mortality Score.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of critically ill COVID-19 patients
treated in tertiary reference COVID-19 hospitals during the year 2020. The 4C
Mortality Score was calculated upon admission to the hospital. The Simplified
Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were
calculated upon admission to the ICU. Patients were divided into two groups: ICU 
survivors and ICU non-survivors.
RESULTS: A total of 249 patients were included in the study, of which 63.1% were 
male. The average age of all patients was 61.32 ± 13.3 years. The all-cause ICU
mortality ratio was 41.4% (n = 103). To determine the accuracy of the ICU
mortality risk scores a ROC-AUC analysis was performed. The most accurate scale
was the APACHE II, with an AUC value of 0.772 (95% CI 0.714-0.830; p < 0.001).
All of the ICU risk scores and 4C Mortality Score were significant mortality
predictors in the univariate regression analysis. The multivariate regression
analysis was completed to elucidate which of the scores can be used in
combination with the independent predictive value. In the final model, the APACHE
II and 4C Mortality Score prevailed. For each point increase in the APACHE II,
mortality risk increased by 1.155 (OR 1.155, 95% CI 1.085-1.229; p < 0.001), and 
for each point increase in the 4C Mortality Score, mortality risk increased by
1.191 (OR 1.191, 95% CI 1.086-1.306; p < 0.001), demonstrating the best overall
calibration of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the APACHE II had the best
discrimination of mortality in ICU patients. Both the APACHE II and 4C Mortality 
Score independently predict mortality risk and can be used concomitantly.
