Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant impact on the
health care system. As a consequence, diagnosis and treatment of vector borne
diseases including dengue has been equally affected. Nepal is no exception to
this, where COVID-19 cases is exponentially increased and all resources are
concentrated on its prevention, control and management. Dengue, one of the major 
vector-borne diseases in Nepal, is apparently overlooked despite approaching the 
peak season of the disease. The aim of this paper is to describe the double
burden of COVID-19 and dengue in Nepal, particularly highlighting the
co-circulation and possible coinfections. This has posed higher risk of increased
severity, more severe cases and deaths in Nepal. Moreover, potential misdiagnosis
of these viral diseases may lead to delayed or, inappropriate treatment and poor 
allocation of resources.
