The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) represents a challenge for global
health. Since the outbreak began, the number of confirmed cases has exceeded 117 
million, with more than 2.6 million deaths worldwide. With public health measures
aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries have faced a
crisis in the availability of intensive care units. Currently, a large-scale
effort is underway to identify the nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus that is an etiological agent of COVID-19. Global sequencing of
thousands of viral genomes has revealed many common genetic variants, which
enables the monitoring of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the tracking of its
spread over time. Understanding the current evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary 
not only for a retrospective analysis of the new coronavirus infection spread,
but also for the development of approaches to the therapy and prophylaxis of
COVID-19. In this review, we have focused on the general characteristics of
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Also, we have analyzed available publications on the
genetic diversity of the virus and the relationship between the diversity and the
biological properties of SARS-CoV-2, such as virulence and contagiousness.
