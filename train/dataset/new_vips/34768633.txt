To investigate the potential treatment evolution and outcome improvement, we
retrospectively compared clinical characteristics, therapeutic strategies,
treatment responses, and overall survival (OS) in patients diagnosed and treated 
with lymphoma-associated HLH between 2004-2012 (n = 30) and 2013-2021 (n = 26).
Our study showed that the clinical characteristics of lymphoma-associated HLH did
not substantially change over the past two decades. However, more patients
diagnosed in 2013-2021 were tested for Epstein-Barr virus than those diagnosed in
2004-2012 (69.3% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.021). In addition, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 3-4 (hazard ratio (HR): 5.38; 95% confidence intervals
(CI): 2.49-11.61; p < 0.001) and jaundice (HR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.37-6.18; p =
0.006) were poor prognostic factors for lymphoma-associated HLH. With a
comparable response rate of lymphoma treatment, patients treated in 2013-2021 had
a numerically greater median OS than those treated in 2004-2012 (23.6 ± 19.8 vs. 
9.7 ± 4.5 months). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p =
0.334). In conclusion, early diagnosis and tailored treatments that balance
efficacy and adverse events remain the key to obtaining a better outcome in
lymphoma-associated HLH.
