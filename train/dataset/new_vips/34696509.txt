We report the in vitro efficacy of ion-channel inhibitors amantadine, memantine
and rimantadine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). In VeroE6 cells, rimantadine was most potent followed by memantine 
and amantadine (50% effective concentrations: 36, 80 and 116 µM, respectively).
Rimantadine also showed the highest selectivity index, followed by amantadine and
memantine (17.3, 12.2 and 7.6, respectively). Similar results were observed in
human hepatoma Huh7.5 and lung carcinoma A549-hACE2 cells. Inhibitors interacted 
in a similar antagonistic manner with remdesivir and had a similar barrier to
viral escape. Rimantadine acted mainly at the viral post-entry level and
partially at the viral entry level. Based on these results, rimantadine showed
the most promise for treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
