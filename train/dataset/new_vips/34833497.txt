Background and Objectives: Seroepidemiological studies indicate that parvovirus
B19 circulates in all areas of the world, although with some differences. The aim
of this study is to analyze the seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 in the Croatian 
population. Materials and Methods: From 2010 to 2021, 1538 serum samples from
different populations were tested for the presence of parvovirus B19 IgM/IgG
antibodies. Serological tests were performed using a commercial enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Results: IgG antibodies were detected in 986/64.1% of
participants with differences (p < 0.001) among the following population groups: 
42.4% of children and adolescents, 67.1% of the adult general population, 66.7%
of hemodialysis patients, and 65.6% of liver transplant recipients.
Seroprevalence increased with age, from 30.0% in the 6 months-9 years age group
to 69.0% in the 40-49 years age group, and remained stable thereafter
(68.8-73.3%). There was no difference in the seropositivity among males (66.1%)
and females (63.1%), as well as the place of residence (suburban/rural 63.9%,
urban 64.1%). IgM antibodies (current/recent infection) were found in 61/4.0% of 
participants with the highest seropositivity in the youngest age group (11.1%).
In pregnant women, seroprevalence was higher in women with an unfavorable
obstetric history compared with a normal pregnancy (IgG 71.0% vs. 62.6%; IgM 6.5%
vs. 2.4%), but these differences were not significant. Logistic regression showed
that the adult population had almost three times higher risk of IgG
seropositivity compared to children/adolescents (general population OR = 2.777,
95% CI = 2.023-3.812; hemodialysis patients OR = 2.586, 95% CI = 1.531-4.367; and
transplant patients OR = 2.717, 95% CI = 1.604-4.603). A one-year increase in age
increased the risk of IgG seroprevalence (OR = 1.017; 95% CI = 1.011-1.022).
Conclusions: Older age was the main risk factor for IgG seropositivity.
Hemodialysis and organ transplantation seem unrelated to the increased parvovirus
B19 seroprevalence. The role of parvovirus B19 in the etiology of TORCH
infections needs to be studied further.
