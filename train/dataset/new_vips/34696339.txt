Influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) plays an important role in
evading host innate immunity. NS1 inhibits interferon (IFN) responses via
multiple mechanisms, including sequestering dsRNA and suppressing retinoic
acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling by interacting with RIG-I and tripartite 
motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25). In the current study, we demonstrated the
mitochondrial localization of NS1 at the early stage of influenza virus
infection. Since NS1 does not contain mitochondria-targeting signals, we
suspected that there is an association between the NS1 and mitochondrial
proteins. This hypothesis was tested by demonstrating the interaction of NS1 with
mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) in a RIG-I-independent manner.
Importantly, the association with MAVS facilitated the mitochondrial localization
of NS1 and thereby significantly impeded MAVS-mediated Type I IFN production.
