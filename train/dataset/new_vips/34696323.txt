West Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus
introduced to North America in 1999. Since 1999, the Earth's average temperature 
has increased by 0.6 °C. Mosquitoes are ectothermic organisms, reliant on
environmental heat sources. Temperature impacts vector-virus interactions which
directly influence arbovirus transmission. RNA viral replication is highly
error-prone and increasing temperature could further increase replication rates, 
mutation frequencies, and evolutionary rates. The impact of temperature on
arbovirus evolutionary trajectories and fitness landscapes has yet to be
sufficiently studied. To investigate how temperature impacts the rate and extent 
of WNV evolution in mosquito cells, WNV was experimentally passaged 12 times in
Culex tarsalis cells, at 25 °C and 30 °C. Full-genome deep sequencing was used to
compare genetic signatures during passage, and replicative fitness was evaluated 
before and after passage at each temperature. Our results suggest adaptive
potential at both temperatures, with unique temperature-dependent and
lineage-specific genetic signatures. Further, higher temperature passage was
associated with significantly increased replicative fitness at both temperatures 
and increases in nonsynonymous mutations. Together, these data indicate that if
similar selective pressures exist in natural systems, increases in temperature
could accelerate emergence of high-fitness strains with greater phenotypic
plasticity.
