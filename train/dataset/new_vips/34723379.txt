INTRODUCTION: Having an adequate supply of personal protective equipment during
the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant challenge for hospitals across the
United States. In the event of shortages, our assembled mask might offer
noninferior protection compared to an N95 respirator.
OBJECTIVE: To study the ability of an assembled mask to pass a quantitative fit
testing.
METHODS: We conducted a feasibility study at the Oklahoma City Veteran Affairs
Health Care System. Volunteers were fitted with an assembled mask made of either 
a Hans Rudolph half-face mask or a Respironics Performax full-face mask, attached
to an Iso-Gard HEPA light Filter 28022 through a Performax SE elbow hinge.
Quantitative fit testing was conducted using the Occupation Safety and Health
Administration fit testing protocol. The primary outcome was the percentage of
participants who pass the quantitative fit test. Secondary outcomes included the 
overall fit factor (FF), average FF for different exercises, changes in pulse
oximetry and end-tidal CO2 at 0 and 15 minutes, willingness to use the mask, and 
visibility assessment.
RESULTS: Twenty participants completed the study, and all (100 percent) passed
the quantitative fit testing. The overall FF had a geometric mean of 2,317
(range: 208-16,613) and a geometric standard deviation of 3.8. The lowest FF was 
recorded while the subjects were talking. Between time 0 and 15 minutes, there
was no clinically significant change in pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO2 levels. 
Most participants reported "very good" visibility and were "highly likely" to use
the Hans Rudolph half-face mask in the case of shortage.
CONCLUSION: Our assembled respirator offers noninferior protection to N95
respirators in the setting of hypothetical protective equipment shortage.
