Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic. Recent evidence has demonstrated in vitro
activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract viruses, including
SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the current global pandemic COVID-19. A mechanism of
action acting on different phases of the viral cycle is assumed. In addition to
its in vitro antiviral properties, some evidence also suggests immunomodulatory
and antifibrotic activity. These properties of azithromycin could be useful in
the treatment of viral respiratory tract infections such as COVID-19. However,
clinical data on the antiviral efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of
respiratory tract infections are inconsistent, both when used as monotherapy and 
in polypharmacological combination. In addition, cases of azithromycin-induced QT
long and malignant arrhythmias are reported. In this short review, we attempt to 
determine the role of azithromycin in the treatment of viral respiratory tract
infections such as COVID-19, therapeutic efficacy, or inefficacy?
