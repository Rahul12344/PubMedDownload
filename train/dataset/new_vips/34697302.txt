The Arenaviridae family includes several viruses that cause severe human
hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality, with no effective countermeasures
currently available. The arenavirus multi-domain L protein is involved in viral
transcription and replication and represents a promising target for antiviral
drugs. The arenavirus matrix protein Z is a small multi-functional protein that
inhibits the activities of the L protein. Here we report the structure of Machupo
virus L protein in complex with Z determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The Z
protein acts as a staple and binds the L protein with 1:1 stoichiometry at the
intersection between the PA-C-like region, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and
PB2-N-like region. Binding of the Z protein may lock the multiple domains of L
into a fixed arrangement leading to loss of catalytic activity. These results
further our understanding of the inhibitory mechanism of arenavirus replication
machinery and provide a novel perspective to develop antiviral drugs.
