Trapping by active sites on surfaces plays important roles in various chemical
and biological processes, including catalysis, enzymatic reactions, and viral
entry into host cells. However, the mechanisms of these processes remain not well
understood, mostly because the existing theoretical descriptions are not fully
accounting for the role of the surfaces. Here, we present a theoretical
investigation on the dynamics of surface-assisted trapping by specific active
sites. In our model, a diffusing particle can occasionally reversibly bind to the
surface and diffuse on it before reaching the final target site. An approximate
theoretical framework is developed, and its predictions are tested by Brownian
dynamics computer simulations. It is found that the surface diffusion can be
crucial in mediating trapping by active sites. Our theoretical predictions work
reasonably well as long as the area of the active site is much smaller than the
overall surface area. Potential applications of our approach are discussed.
