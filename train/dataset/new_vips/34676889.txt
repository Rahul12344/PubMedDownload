In the last 10 years, an increased number of patients presenting with acute
encephalitis is being observed, a finding that is attributed to autoimmune
mechanisms. Despite the fact that autoantibodies usually target the neuronal cell
surface or synaptic proteins in the central nervous system (CNS), in many cases
these remain undetectable, constituting a future diagnostic and therapeutic
challenge. Human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) is proven to be a neurotropic virus,
causing various neurological complications mostly in the adult population. We
present the case of a 10-year-old girl, with confirmed active HHV-7 infection of 
the CNS, who developed acute seronegative autoimmune encephalitis. To our best
knowledge, there is no literature concerning pediatric cases of autoimmune
encephalitis following HHV-7 infection.
