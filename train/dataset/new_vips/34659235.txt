Background: The immune response plays a pivotal role in dictating the clinical
outcome in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected 
adults, but it is still poorly investigated in the pediatric population.
Methods: Of 209 enrolled subjects, 155 patients were confirmed by PCR and/or
serology as having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Blood samples were
obtained at a median of 2.8 (interquartile, 2.1-3.7) and 6.1 (5.3-7.2) months
after baseline (symptom onset and/or first positive virus detection). The immune 
profiles of activation, senescence, exhaustion, and regulatory cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were detected by a
plaque reduction neutralization test. In available nasopharyngeal swabs at
baseline, SARS-CoV-2 levels were quantified by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR).
Results: Overall, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of immune activation,
exhaustion, and regulatory cells compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Within the
COVID-19 group, activated and senescent cells were higher in adults than in
children and inversely correlated with the nAbs levels. Conversely, Tregs and
Bregs regulatory cells were higher in COVID-19 children compared to adults and
positively correlated with nAbs. Higher immune activation still persisted in
adults after 6 months of infection, while children maintained higher levels of
regulatory cells. SARS-CoV-2 levels did not differ among age classes.
Conclusions: Adults displayed higher immune activation and lower production of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs than children. The different immune response was not related
to different viral load. The higher expression of regulatory cells in children
may contribute to reduce the immune activation, thus leading to a greater
specific response against the virus.
