BACKGROUND: Tumour-unrelated, virus-specific bystander CD8+ T cells were recently
shown to be abundant among tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). However, their
roles in tumour immunity have not been elucidated yet.
METHODS: We studied the characteristics of bystander CD8+ TILs from non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues (N=66) and their activation by interleukin
(IL)-15 to repurpose them for tumour immunotherapy.
RESULTS: We show that bystander CD8+ TILs specific to various viruses are present
in human NSCLC tissues. We stimulated CD8+ TILs ex vivo using IL-15 without
cognate antigens and found that IL-15 treatment upregulated NKG2D expression on
CD8+ TILs, resulting in NKG2D-dependent production of interferon (IFN)-γ
(p=0.0006). Finally, we tested whether IL-15 treatment can control tumour growth 
in a murine NSCLC model with or without a history of murine cytomegalovirus
(MCMV) infection. IL-15 treatment reduced the number of tumour nodules in the
lung only in mice with MCMV infection (p=0.0037). We confirmed that MCMV-specific
bystander CD8+ TILs produced interferon (IFN)-γ after IL-15 treatment, and that
IL-15 treatment in MCMV-infected mice upregulated tumour necrosis factor-α and
IFN-γ responsive genes in tumour microenvironment.
CONCLUSION: Thus, the study demonstrates that bystander CD8+ TILs can be
repurposed by IL-15 for tumour immunotherapy.
