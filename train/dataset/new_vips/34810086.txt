The clinical impact of viral neuroinvasion on the central nervous system (CNS)
ranges from barely detectable to deadly, including acute and chronic outcomes.
Developing innovative therapeutic strategies is important to mitigate
virus-induced neurological and psychiatric disorders. A key gatekeeper to the CNS
is the neurovascular unit (NVU), a major obstacle to viral neuroinvasion and
antiviral therapies. The NVU isolates the brain from the blood through firm
sealing operated by the tight junctions (TJs) of endothelial cells. Here, we make
the thought-provoking assumption that TJs can be targets to prevent or treat
viral neuroinvasion and resulting disorders. This review aims at defining the
conceptual diverse mode of actions of such approaches, evaluates their
feasibility, and discusses future challenges in the field.
