The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) has 1945 residues and 
is the largest protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2. It comprises more than a dozen
independent domains with various functions. Many of these domains were studied in
the closely-related virus SARS-CoV following an earlier outbreak. Nonetheless
structural and functional information on the C-terminal region of nsp3 containing
two transmembrane and three extra-membrane domains remains incomplete. This part 
of the protein appears to be involved in initiation of double membrane vesicle
(DMV) formation, membranous organelles the virus builds to hide its
replication-transcription complex from host immune defenses. Here we present the 
near-complete backbone and Ile, Leu, and Val methyl group chemical shift
assignments of the most C-terminal domain of nsp3, CoV-Y. As the exact function
and binding partners of CoV-Y remain unknown, our data provide a basis for future
NMR studies of protein-protein interactions to elucidate the molecular mechanism 
of DMV formation.
