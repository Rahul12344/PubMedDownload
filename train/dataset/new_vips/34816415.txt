Ticks are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that infect domestic animals,
humans, and wildlife. Ticks can transmit a wide range of pathogens (viruses,
rickettsia, bacteria, parasites, etc.), and some of those are of zoonotic
importance. Tick-borne diseases have a negative economic impact in several
tropical and subtropical countries. With climate change, tick distribution and
tick-associated pathogens have increased. Currently, tick control procedures have
more environmental drawbacks and there are pitfalls in vaccination process. Since
vaccinations have helped to prevent several diseases and infections, several
vaccination trials are ongoing to control ticks and tick-borne pathogens.
However, autoimmune reactions to vaccinations are reported as an adverse reaction
since vaccines were used to protect against disease in humans and animals. The
antibodies against the vaccine antigen might harm similar antigen in the host.
Therefore, in this chapter, we attempt to shed light on the importance of raising
awareness of possible adverse events associated with vaccinations and the methods
that should be used to address this problem. In silico and lab work should be
performed ahead of the vaccination process to evaluate the vaccine candidates and
avoid the vaccination opposing consequences.
