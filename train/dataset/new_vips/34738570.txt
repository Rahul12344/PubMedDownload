Background and aim This study analyses the impact of the first two pandemic waves
on surgical urgencies/emergencies and their consequences on an entire provincial 
hospital network's surgical activities. Methods  Clinical and epidemiological
data of urgent/emergent surgical admissions and interventions in the Autonomous
Province of Trento's hospital network were collected from the internal common
electronic database. The investigation periods were March-May 2019 (reference
period), March-May 2020 (phase-I), June - August 2020 (phase-II), and October -
December 2020 (phase-III). The same data were divided and grouped for the six
most represented diagnoses. Results: The number of admissions for surgical
emergencies in the studied periods showed a sinusoidal trend. In the reference
period of 2019, 957 patients were admitted in urgency, while in the three
pandemic phases, urgent admissions were 511, 888 and 633 respectively (-47% in
phase I, - 8% in phase II, -34% in phase III). This trend was also observed by
stratifying admissions for single disease, except for gastrointestinal
perforations and pancreatitis, which showed a slight increasing trend in phase-I.
Among the studied population, the surgical rate was 35.2% in phase-I and 34.3% in
phase-III; these data were significantly higher than in 2019 (25.6%). 
Conclusions The effect of the COVID pandemic on surgical emergencies and
urgencies (SUEs) was mainly indirect, manifesting itself with a significant
reduction in the number of surgical admissions, particularly in phases-I and-III.
Conversely, in the same phases, the surgical rate showed a significant increase
compared to 2019.
