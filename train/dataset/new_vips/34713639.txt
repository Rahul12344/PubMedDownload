The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has rapidly changed hospital
structures in our country, radically modifying clinical activity. Nephrology, and
kidney transplant in particular, has been heavily influenced by it, with a
reduced number of organ donations and, consequently, transplantations. Here we
report the data on kidney transplants in our region, Sicily, for the period
2019-July 2021, and we analyze the effects of the pandemic.
