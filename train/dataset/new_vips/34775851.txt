BACKGROUND: The use of transversus abdominis plane blocks has been previously
shown in both large-scale studies and our own institution to significantly reduce
postoperative pain and opioid use. In addition, the use of bilateral transversus 
abdominis plane blocks using liposomal bupivacaine in combination with neuraxial 
morphine significantly reduced post-cesarean-delivery pain and opioid use. During
the COVID-19 crisis, our anesthesia department in a collaborative effort with our
obstetric colleagues thought that the use of bilateral transversus abdominis
plane blocks with liposomal bupivacaine could reduce the use of opioids to treat 
postoperative pain and might result in decreased length of stay.
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study of 288 
patients who underwent cesarean delivery under spinal or epidural (neuraxial)
anesthesia at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY was conducted. Historical
controls were from 142 consecutive patients from 1 January 2012 through 12 May
2012. An additional set of controls consisted of 30 consecutive patients from 10 
March 2020 through 13 April 2020. The primary outcome data analyzed were the use 
of opioids and length of stay.
RESULTS: Post cesarean delivery, patients who received both bilateral transversus
abdominis plane blocks with liposomal bupivacaine and neuraxial morphine was
associated with a significant decrease in the number of patients using post
operative opioids, 54%-60% decreased to 18% (p < 0.001), and a decreased length
of stay; 3.1 days was reduced to 2.39 (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Neuraxial opioids combined with liposomal bupivacaine transversus
abdominis plane blocks provided significant pain relief for patients post
cesarean delivery, required less post operative opioids, and facilitated earlier 
discharge that may aid in reducing patient exposure and hospital burden secondary
to COVID-19.
