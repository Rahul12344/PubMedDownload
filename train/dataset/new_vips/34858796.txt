Background: Ebola virus emerged in West Africa in December 2013. The ease of
mobility, porous borders, and lack of public health infrastructure led to the
largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak to date.
Intervention: The 2013 EVD outbreak signalled the need for laboratory diagnostic 
capabilities in areas without strong public health systems. As part of the United
States' Department of Defense response, MRIGlobal was contracted to design,
fabricate, equip, deploy, and operate two mobile diagnostic laboratories (MDLs). 
The first laboratory analysed blood samples from patients in an adjacent Ebola
Treatment Centre (ETC) and buccal swabs from the deceased in the community in
Moyamba, Sierra Leone. The second laboratory was deployed to support an ETC in
Conakry, Guinea. The Department of Defense provided real-time quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays that were deployed and
validated on-site.
Lessons Learnt: Prompt and accurate molecular diagnostics reduced sample
turn-around times from over 24 h to under 4 h. Experienced laboratory staff
tested up to 110 samples per day and on-site engineering proved necessary for MDL
setup and operation. As the Ebola response slowed, the sustainment of the MDLs'
operations was prioritised, including staff training and the transition of the
MDLs to local governments. Training programmes for local staff were prepared in
Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Recommendations: The MRIGlobal MDL team significantly contributed to establishing
increased laboratory capacity during the EVD outbreak in West Africa. Using the
MDLs for molecular diagnosis is highly recommended until more sustainable
solutions can be provided.
