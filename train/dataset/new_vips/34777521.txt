Background: Deoxyuracil triphosphate nucleotide (dUTP) pyrophosphatase (dUTPase, 
DU) is an enzyme of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) that minimizes
incorporation of dUTP into the DNA. Caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus relies
partly on its ability to escape from innate immunity to cause persistent
infections. Interferon β (IFN-β) is an important marker for evaluating the innate
immune system, and it has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity.
Aims: This study was conducted to investigate the details of the IFN-β response
to CAEV infection.
Methods: The expression of IFN-β and the proliferation of Sendai virus (SeV) and 
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were determined by real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The effect of DU on the IFN signaling pathway
was evaluated using luciferase reporter assays.
Results: In our study, the expression of IFN-β was significantly inhibited and
the proliferation of SeV and VSV was promoted in cells overexpressing CAEV-DU. DU
affected interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) and IFN-β promoter
activities induced by RIG-I/MDA5/MAVS/TBK1 pathway, while did not affect them
induced by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3-5D).
Conclusion: DU protein downregulated the production of IFN-β by inhibiting the
activity of the signal transduction molecules upstream of IRF3, thereby, helping 
CAEV escape innate immunity. Findings of this work provide an evidence to
understand the persistent infection and multiple system inflammation of CAEV.
