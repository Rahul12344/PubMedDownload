Objectives: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, older people are threatened, and there 
may be different psychological responses toward COVID-19 between women and men.
The present study explored the factors and gender differences related to the fear
of COVID-19 among older women and men in Taiwan. Methods: Geriatric patients (n =
139; 42 men; mean age = 71.73Â years) who visited outpatient departments were
recruited. They self-reported demographic data and completed questions asking
about (i) their fear of COVID-19, (ii) whether they paid attention to COVID-19
news, (iii) whether searched for COVID-19 news, (iv) whether they believed in
COVID-19 news, and (v) their preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Results: Both women
and men reported a low fear of COVID-19, paid close attention to COVID-19 news,
and practiced good preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. The perceived chance 
of COVID-19 infection was a significant factor contributing to the fear of
COVID-19 among both women and men. Preventive behaviors had a positive effect in 
lowering the fear of COVID-19. News about COVID-19 had a negative effect in
lowering the fear of the disease among women but not men. Conclusions: As the
performing of preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors was associated with a lower
fear of COVID-19, healthcare providers should consider strategies for improving
preventive behaviors among older people to help ease their worries and fears
concerning COVID-19.
