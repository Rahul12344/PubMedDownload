Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a B-cell lymphoma caused by the bovine leukemia
virus (BLV). Although an association between EBL and mutations in the bovine
tumor suppressor gene TP53 (bTP53) has been suggested, the substantive incidence 
rate of bTP53 mutations in EBL cattle is still unclear. In this study, we
investigated the complete sequence (exons 2-11) of bTP53 in tissue and peripheral
blood leukocyte (PBL) samples obtained from 154 EBL cattle and 117 cattle without
EBL (non-EBL cattle) to elucidate the correlation between bTP53 mutations and
EBL. The detection frequencies of non-synonymous (NS) and deletion mutations in
bTP53 in EBL cattle were significantly higher than those in non-EBL cattle in
both tissue and PBL samples (p < 0.05). Among these mutations in EBL cattle, 73.7
% (42/54) were homologous to those of human TP53 (hTP53), which were previously
detected in various tumors. It has been reported that 95.2 % (40/42) of these
hTP53 mutations induced complete or partial loss of the transactivating function 
of its encoding protein, P53. Moreover, the BLV proviral load in tissue samples
was significantly higher in cattle harboring bTP53 NS and deletion mutations than
in cattle without these mutations in both EBL and BLV-infected non-EBL cattle (p 
< 0.05). Although the activity of the mutant variants of bP53 must be further
investigated, our findings revealed that bTP53 mutations are involved in
tumorigenesis in BLV-infected cells and EBL-associated carcinogenesis.
