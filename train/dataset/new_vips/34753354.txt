Phocine distemper virus (PDV) is a morbillivirus that circulates within pinnipeds
in the North Atlantic. PDV has caused two known unusual mortality events (UMEs)
in western Europe (1988, 2002), and two UMEs in the northwest Atlantic (2006,
2018). Infrequent cross-species transmission and waning immunity are believed to 
contribute to periodic outbreaks with high mortality in western Europe. The viral
ecology of PDV in the northwest Atlantic is less well defined and outbreaks have 
exhibited lower mortality than those in western Europe. This study sought to
understand the molecular and ecological processes underlying PDV infection in
eastern North America. We provide phylogenetic evidence that PDV was introduced
into northwest Atlantic pinnipeds by a single lineage and is now endemic in local
populations. Serological and viral screening of pinniped surveillance samples
from 2006 onward suggest there is continued circulation of PDV outside of UMEs
among multiple species with and without clinical signs. We report six full genome
sequences and nine partial sequences derived from harbour and grey seals in the
northwest Atlantic from 2011 through 2018, including a possible regional variant.
Work presented here provides a framework towards greater understanding of how
recovering populations and shifting species may impact disease transmission.
