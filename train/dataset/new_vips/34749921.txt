Pandemics past, present, and future: Their impact on oral health care.

Samaranayake L, Fakhruddin KS.

BACKGROUND: Pandemics have significantly modified our societal behaviour over the
millennia, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception.
TYPES OF ARTICLES REVIEWED: In this article, the authors review the history of
pandemics, the probable reasons for their emergence, and the COVID-19 pandemic
due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its
variants, as well as its possible impact on dentistry during the postpandemic
period.
RESULTS: There are multiple reasons why catastrophic pandemics occur due to new
infectious organisms that cross the species barrier from animals to humans. These
include, population explosion, mass migration, and prolonged survival of
debilitated and susceptible cohorts on various immunosuppressants. Coupled with
global warming and the resultant loss of habitats, such vicissitudes of humans
and nature lead to microbes evolving and mutating at an exponential pace, paving 
the way for pandemics. The contemporary epidemics and pandemics beginning with
the HIV pandemic have modulated dentistry beyond recognition, now with assiduous 
and robust infection control measures in place.
CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Because COVID-19 may become an endemic
disease, particularly due to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants the dental community
should adopt modified infection control measures, teledentistry, and
point-of-care diagnostics, among other measures. It is likely, that clinical
ecosystems in future would be rendered even safer by predicting how pathogens
evolve and priming the human immune system for the next wave of microbial
combatants through vaccines produced using deep mutational scanning in which
artificial intelligence and machine learning can predict the next variants even
before their arrival.
