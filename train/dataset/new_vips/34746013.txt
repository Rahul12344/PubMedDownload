Background: De novo tumors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after
long-term solid organ transplantation. Chronic immunosuppression strongly affects
solid organ transplanted (SOT) patients' immune system by promoting immune
evasion strategies and reactivations of viruses with oncogenic potential,
ultimately leading to cancer onset. In this scenario, an oncological Surveillance
Protocol integrated with biobanking of peripheral blood samples and evaluation of
immunovirological and molecular parameters was activated for SOT patients at
CRO-IRCCS Aviano, with the aim of identifying suitable biomarkers of cancer
development.
Methods: An exploratory longitudinal study was designed based on two serial
peripheral blood samples collected at least three months apart. Forty nine SOT
patients were selected and stratified by tumor onset during follow-up.
Spontaneous T-cell responses to EBV, CMV and tumor associated antigens, EBV-DNA
and CMV-DNA loads, and circulating TERT mRNA levels were investigated.
Results: Significantly higher levels of circulating TERT mRNA were observed
3.5-23.5 months before and close to the diagnosis of cancer as compared to
tumor-free patients. Plasmatic TERT mRNA levels >97.73 copies/mL at baseline were
significantly associated with the risk of developing de novo tumors (HR=4.0,
95%C.I. = 1.4-11.5, p=0.01). In particular, the risk significantly increased by
4% with every ten-unit increment in TERT mRNA (HR=1.04, 95%C.I. = 1.01-1.07,
p=0.01).
Conclusions: Although obtained in an exploratory study, our data support the
importance of identifying early biomarkers of tumor onset in SOT patients useful 
to modulate the pace of surveillance visits.
