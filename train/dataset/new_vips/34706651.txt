BACKGROUND: While Covid-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system,
neurological manifestations including encephalitis occur in some patients,
possibly affecting the course and outcome of the disease. Here, we describe a
unique case of a young man with Covid-19 and transient MOG-positive encephalitis,
with a benign course.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old male, with PCR confirmed Covid-19 infection was 
admitted because of persistent headache. The clinical examination was normal.
Neuropsychological testing revealed distinct executive deficits. Brain MRI and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were suggestive for encephalitis. Further
laboratory examination revealed a serum MOG antibody titre. The headache improved
with analgetic treatment and i.v. methylprednisolone. Consequently, the MOG
antibody titer decreased and MRI lesions were resolving. The patient made a full 
recovery, with no signs of deterioration over the following months.
CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 manifestations in the CNS include encephalitis with
variable course and prognosis. This case highlights a possible association
between inflammation due to COVID-19 and transient secondary autoimmunity with
transient MOG antibodies and atypical clinical presentation.
