PURPOSE: This study evaluated the validity and reliability of the Korean version 
of the Face Mask Use Scale (K-FMUS) among community-dwelling adults.
METHODS: The participants of the study were community-dwelling adults in Korea
using face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The English FMUS was translated
into Korean using forward and backward translation procedures. The construct
validity and reliability of the K-FMUS were evaluated using the exploratory and
confirmatory factor analyses and the internal consistency reliability test.
RESULTS: The K-FMUS comprised 6 items divided into 2 factors. The variance of the
factors was approximately 79.1%, which suggested that the scale indicated the
effectiveness of face mask usage. The two factors were labeled as face mask use
in society (4 items) and face mask use at home (2 items). Cronbach's α value for 
the overall scale was .88.
CONCLUSION: The K-FMUS is a valid and reliable scale that can be used to measure 
face mask usage among community-dwelling adults in Korea during the COVID-19
pandemic.
