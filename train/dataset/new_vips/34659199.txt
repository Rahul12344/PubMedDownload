Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is an inflammatory
immune disease characterized by intraprostatic leukocyte infiltration and pelvic 
or perineal pain. Macrophages play vital roles in the pathogenesis of CP/CPPS.
However, the mechanisms controlling the activation and chemotaxis of macrophages 
in CP/CPPS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the roles of the
CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway in the activation and chemotaxis of macrophages in CP/CPPS
patients. The serums of CP/CPPS patients and healthy volunteers were collected
and measured. Results showed that CXCL10 expression was significantly elevated
and correlated with the severity of CP/CPPS patients. The experimental autoimmune
prostatitis (EAP) model was generated, and adeno-associated virus and CXCR3
inhibitors were used to treat EAP mice. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and
Western blotting were used to analyze the functional phenotype and regulation
mechanism of macrophages. Results showed that CXCL10 deficiency ameliorates EAP
severity by inhibiting infiltration of macrophages to prostate. Moreover, CXCL10 
could induce macrophage migrations and secretions of proinflammatory mediators
via CXCR3, which consequently activated the downstream Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK
signaling pathways. We also showed that prostatic stromal cell is a potential
source of CXCL10. Our results indicated CXCL10 as an important mediator involved 
in inflammatory infiltration and pain symptoms of prostatitis by promoting the
migration of macrophages and secretion of inflammatory mediators via
CXCR3-mediated ERK and p38 MAPK activation.
