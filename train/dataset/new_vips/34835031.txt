It has been 20 months since we first heard of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus
detected in the Hubei province, China, in December 2019, responsible for the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, a myriad of studies aimed at understanding
and controlling SARS-CoV-2 have been published at a pace that has outshined the
original effort to combat HIV during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. This
massive response started by developing strategies to not only diagnose individual
SARS-CoV-2 infections but to monitor the transmission, evolution, and global
spread of this new virus. We currently have hundreds of commercial diagnostic
tests; however, that was not the case in early 2020, when just a handful of
protocols were available, and few whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences had been
described. It was mid-January 2020 when several District Health Boards across New
Zealand started planning the implementation of diagnostic testing for this
emerging virus. Here, we describe our experience implementing a molecular test to
detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, adapting the RT-qPCR assay to be used in a
random-access platform (Hologic Panther Fusion® System) in a clinical laboratory,
and characterizing the first whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained in the
South Island, right at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New Zealand.
We expect that this work will help us and others prepare for the unequivocal risk
of similar viral outbreaks in the future.
