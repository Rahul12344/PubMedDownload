Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 200 million
individuals around the globe and caused millions of deaths. Although there are
now multiple vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, their efficacy may be limited by current
and future viral mutations. Therefore, effective antiviral compounds are an
essential component to win the battle against the family of coronaviruses.
Ginkgolic Acid (GA) is a pan-antiviral molecule with proven effective in vitro
and in vivo activity. We previously demonstrated that GA inhibits Herpes Simplex 
Virus 1 (HSV-1) by disrupting viral structure, blocking fusion, and inhibiting
viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we reported that GA displays
broad-spectrum fusion inhibition encompassing all three classes of fusion
proteins, including those of HIV, Ebola, influenza A, and Epstein Barr virus.
Here, we report that GA exhibited potent antiviral activity against Human
Coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) infection of human epithelial lung cells
(MRC-5). GA significantly reduced progeny virus production, expression of viral
proteins, and cytopathic effects (CPE). Furthermore, GA significantly inhibited
HCoV-229E even when added post-infection. In light of our findings and the
similarities of this family of viruses, GA holds promising potential as an
effective antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
