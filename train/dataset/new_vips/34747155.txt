Stringent public health measures imposed across Canada to control the COVID-19
pandemic have nearly suppressed most seasonal respiratory viruses, with the
notable exception of human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV/EV). Thanks to this
unexpected persistence, we highlight that hRV/EV could serve as a sentinel for
levels of contact rate in populations to inform on the efficiency, or the need
of, public health measures to control the subsequent COVID-19 epidemic, but also 
for future epidemics from other seasonal or emerging respiratory pathogens.
