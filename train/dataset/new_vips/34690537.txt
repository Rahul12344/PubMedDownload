Vaccination is an important part of the fight against COVID-19 virus. A predictor
of the proportion of people who will actually take a vaccination is the
willingness to vaccinate among the population. Literature shows that vaccination 
willingness among people with lower socioeconomic status is lower than among
other groups. In this contribution we describe to what extent this is also the
case in the Netherlands and show how risk perception, trust in the effects and
safety of the vaccine, and health literacy may be related to this. Finally, we
highlight a number of intervention strategies that can make a positive
contribution to vaccination willingness among lower educated groups.
