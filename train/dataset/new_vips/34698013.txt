Health organizations play a pivotal role during pandemic preparedness, response
and recovery. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vancouver Coastal
Health, BC, adapted their delivery of mental health and substance use services.
Healthcare providers were required to be flexible while continuing to provide
patient care. To understand how healthcare providers in the mental health and
substance use field experienced the COVID-19 response at their workplace, a
quality improvement initiative was designed. This initiative aimed to evaluate
their perceptions using an online survey tool that explored their insights
related to communication, redeployment and safety and well-being. The survey
results aligned with the ADKAR (awareness, desire, knowledge, ability and
reinforcement) model of change management, which informed our recommendations to 
healthcare leaders to support ongoing pandemic response procedures.
