Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is thus deemed to a global health problem. Renal
fibrosis, characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components 
in the kidney, is considered a common pathway leading to CKD. Regulator of
calcineurin1 (RCAN1), identified as a competitive endogenous inhibitor of the
phosphatase calcineurin, participates in ECM deposition in various organs.
However, the role of RCAN1 in renal fibrosis remains unclear. Here, unilateral
ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-known model to induce renal fibrosis in vivo, 
was performed on mice for a week. To overexpress RCAN1.4 in vivo, recombinant
adeno-associated virus 9-packed RCAN1.4 over-expression plasm was employed in
mice kidney. Lentivirus-packed RCAN1.4 over-expression plasm was employed to
transfer into HK-2 and NRK-49F cells in vitro. The results indicated that RCAN1.4
expression was impaired both in UUO-induced renal fibrosis in vivo and
TGF-β1-induced renal fibrosis in vitro. However, knocking in of RCAN1.4
suppressed the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) both in vivo and in
vitro. Furthermore, in vitro, the apoptosis-related proteins, including the ratio
of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase3, were elevated in cells transfected with
RCAN1.4 overexpression plasmid. In addition, we found that RCAN1.4 could
rugulated NFAT2 nuclear distribution by inhibiting calcineurin pathway. So
overexpression of RCAN1.4 could reverse renal fibrosis, attenuate ECM related
protein accumulation, promote apoptosis of myofibroblast via inhibiting
Calcineurin/NFAT2 signaling pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrated that 
targeting RCAN1.4 may be therapeutic efficacy in renal fibrosis.
