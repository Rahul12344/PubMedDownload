The fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, calling for fast and 
accurate assays to allow infection diagnosis and prevention of transmission. We
aimed to develop a molecular beacon (MB)-based detection assay for SARS-CoV-2,
designed to detect the ORF1ab and S genes, proposing a two-stage COVID-19 testing
strategy. The novelty of this work lies in the design and optimization of two MBs
for detection of SARS-CoV-2, namely, concentration, fluorescence plateaus of
hybridization, reaction temperature and real-time results. We also identify
putative G-quadruplex (G4) regions in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 458
nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples (426 positive and 32 negative) were tested
with the MB assay and the fluorescence levels compared with the cycle threshold
(Ct) values obtained from a commercial RT-PCR test in terms of test duration,
sensitivity, and specificity. Our results show that the samples with higher
fluorescence levels correspond to those with low Ct values, suggesting a
correlation between viral load and increased MB fluorescence. The proposed assay 
represents a fast (total duration of 2 h 20 min including amplification and
fluorescence reading stages) and simple way of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical
samples from the upper respiratory tract.
