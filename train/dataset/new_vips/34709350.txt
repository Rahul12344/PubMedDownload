Chronic viral infections are associated with hematopoietic suppression, bone
marrow (BM) failure, and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) exhaustion. However, how
persistent viral challenge and inflammatory responses target BM tissues and
perturb hematopoietic competence remains poorly understood. Here, we combine
functional analyses with advanced 3D microscopy to demonstrate that chronic
infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus leads to (1) long-lasting
decimation of the BM stromal network of mesenchymal CXCL12-abundant reticular
cells, (2) proinflammatory transcriptional remodeling of remaining components of 
this key niche subset, and (3) durable functional defects and decreased
competitive fitness in HSCs. Mechanistically, BM immunopathology is elicited by
virus-specific, activated CD8 T cells, which accumulate in the BM via
interferon-dependent mechanisms. Combined antibody-mediated inhibition of type I 
and II IFN pathways completely preempts degeneration of CARc and protects HSCs
from chronic dysfunction. Hence, viral infections and ensuing immune reactions
durably impact BM homeostasis by persistently decreasing the competitive fitness 
of HSCs and disrupting essential stromal-derived, hematopoietic-supporting cues.
