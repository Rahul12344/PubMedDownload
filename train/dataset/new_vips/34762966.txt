Since 2012, cervical cancer screening guidelines allow for choice of screening
test for women age 30-65 years (i.e., Pap every 3 years or Pap with human
papillomavirus co-testing every 5 years). Intended to give patients and providers
options, this flexibility reflects a trend in the growing complexity of screening
guidelines. Our objective was to characterize variation in cervical screening at 
the individual, provider, clinic/facility, and healthcare system levels. The
analysis included 296,924 individuals receiving screening from 3626 providers at 
136 clinics/facilities in three healthcare systems, 2010 to 2017. Main outcome
was receipt of co-testing vs. Pap alone. Co-testing was more common in one
healthcare system before the 2012 guidelines (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of
co-testing at the other systems relative to this system 0.00 and 0.50) but was
increasingly implemented over time in a second with declining uptake in the third
(2017: AORs shifted to 7.32 and 0.01). Despite system-level differences, there
was greater heterogeneity in receipt of co-testing associated with providers than
clinics/facilities. In the three healthcare systems, providers in the highest
quartile of co-testing use had an 8.35, 8.81, and 25.05-times greater odds of
providing a co-test to women with the same characteristics relative to the lowest
quartile. Similarly, clinics/ facilities in the highest quartile of co-testing
use had a 4.20, 3.14, and 6.56-times greater odds of providing a co-test relative
to the lowest quartile. Variation in screening test use is associated with health
system, provider, and clinic/facility levels even after accounting for patient
characteristics.
