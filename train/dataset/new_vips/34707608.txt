Both vaccine "take" and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titer are historical
correlates for vaccine-induced protection from smallpox. We analyzed a subset of 
samples from a phase 2a trial of three DNA/HIV-1 primes and a recombinant Tiantan
vaccinia virus-vectored (rTV)/HIV-1 booster and found that a proportion of
participants showed no anti-vaccinia nAb response to the rTV/HIV-1 booster,
despite successful vaccine "take." Using a rich transcriptomic and
vaccinia-specific immunological dataset with fine kinetic sampling, we
investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying nAb response. Blood
transcription module analysis revealed the downregulation of the activator
protein 1 (AP-1) pathway in responders, but not in non-responders, and the
upregulation of T-cell activation in responders. Furthermore, transcriptional
factor network reconstruction revealed the upregulation of AP-1 core genes at
hour 4 and day 1 post-rTV/HIV-1 vaccination, followed by a downregulation from
day 3 until day 28 in responders. In contrast, AP-1 core and pro-inflammatory
genes were upregulated on day 7 in non-responders. We speculate that persistent
pro-inflammatory signaling early post-rTV/HIV-1 vaccination inhibits the nAb
response.
