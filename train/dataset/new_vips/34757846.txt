Human-to-swine transmission of influenza A virus (IAV) repeatedly occurs, leading
to sustained transmission and increased diversity in swine; human seasonal H3N2
introductions occurred in the 1990s and 2010s and were maintained in North
American swine. Swine H3N2 were subsequently associated with zoonotic infections,
highlighting the need to understand the risk of endemic swine IAV to humans. We
quantified antigenic distances between swine H3N2 and human seasonal vaccine
strains from 1973 to 2014 using a panel of monovalent antisera raised in pigs in 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Swine H3N2 lineages retained closest
antigenic similarity to human vaccine strains from the decade of incursion. Swine
lineages from the 1990s were antigenically more similar to human vaccine strains 
of the mid-1990s but had substantial distance from recent human vaccine strains. 
In contrast, lineages from the 2010s were closer to human vaccine strains from
2011 and 2014 and most antigenically distant from human vaccine strains prior to 
2007. HI assays using ferret antisera demonstrated that swine lineages from the
1990s and 2010s had significant fold-reduction compared with the homologous HI
titer of the nearest pandemic preparedness candidate vaccine virus (CVV) or
seasonal vaccine strain. The assessment of post-infection and post-vaccination
human sera cohorts demonstrated limited cross-reactivity to swine H3N2 from the
1990s, especially in older adults born before 1970s. We identified swine strains 
to which humans are likely to lack population immunity or are not protected
against by a current human seasonal vaccine or CVV to use in prioritizing future 
human CVV strain selection. IMPORTANCE Human H3N2 influenza A viruses spread to
pigs in North America in the 1990s and more recently in the 2010s. These
cross-species events led to sustained circulation and increased H3N2 diversity in
pig populations. Evolution of H3N2 in swine led to a reduced similarity with
human seasonal H3N2 and the vaccine strains used to protect human populations. We
quantified the antigenic phenotypes and found that North American swine H3N2
lineages retained more antigenic similarity to historical human vaccine strains
from the decade of incursion but had substantial difference compared with recent 
human vaccine strains. Additionally, pandemic preparedness vaccine strains
demonstrated a loss in similarity with contemporary swine strains. Lastly, human 
sera revealed that although these adults had antibodies against human H3N2
strains, many had limited immunity to swine H3N2, especially older adults born
before 1970. Antigenic assessment of swine H3N2 provides critical information for
pandemic preparedness and candidate vaccine development.
