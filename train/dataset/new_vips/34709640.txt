Viral proteins evolve to benefit the interaction with host proteins during the
infection and replication processes. A comprehensive understanding of virus
interactome with host proteins may thus lead to the identification of molecular
targets for infection inhibition. We present a procedure for isolating and
identifying the dengue virus interactome with human plasma proteins. It comprises
the fractionation of human plasma by anion exchange chromatography, followed by
affinity purification and mass spectrometry identification of the captured
proteins. This procedure was applied to the characterization of the interactions 
of the four serotypes of dengue virus with human plasma proteins, mediated by the
domain III of the envelope protein of the virus. The resulting interactome
comprises 62 proteins, six of which were validated as new direct interactions of 
the virus with its human host.
