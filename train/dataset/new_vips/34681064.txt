SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to display proclivity towards organs bearing
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) expression cells. Of interest herein is the 
ability of the virus to exhibit neurotropism. However, there is limited
information on how this virus invades the brain. With this contribution, we
explore how, in the context of a microbial co-infection using a cryptococcal
co-infection as a model, SARS-CoV-2 could reach the brain. We theorise that the
secretion of proteases by disseminated fungal cells might also activate the S2
domain of the viral spike glycoprotein for membrane fusion with brain endothelial
cells leading to endocytosis. Understanding this potential invasion mechanism
could lead to better SARS-CoV-2 intervention measures, which may also be
applicable in instances of co-infection, especially with protease-secreting
pathogens.
