The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with
currently no approved effective antiviral drug. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is an
efficient method to analyze metabolic networks. Here, FBA was applied on human
lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the
virus replication within the host tissue. Making use of expression datasets of
infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were
reconstructed. Then, host-specific essential genes and gene pairs were determined
through in silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production
without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with
COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, ferroptosis,
and pyrimidine metabolism. By in silico screening of Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene
pairs, 85 drugs and 52 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates
for COVID-19 (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov).
