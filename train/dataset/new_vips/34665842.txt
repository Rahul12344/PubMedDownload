BACKGROUND: Disclosure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status improves
adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increases the chance of virological
suppression and retention in care. However, information on the effect of
disclosure of HIV status on adherence to clinic visits and patient representation
is limited. We evaluated the effects of disclosure of HIV status on adherence to 
clinic visits and patient representation among people living with HIV in eastern 
Uganda.
METHODS: In this quasi-randomized study, we performed a propensity-score-matched 
analysis on observational data collected between October 2018 and September 2019 
from a large ART clinic in eastern Uganda. We matched participants with disclosed
HIV status to those with undisclosed HIV status based on similar propensity
scores in a 1:1 ratio using the nearest neighbor caliper matching technique. The 
primary outcomes were patient representation (the tendency for patients to have
other people pick-up their medications) and adherence to clinic visits. We fitted
a logistic regression to estimate the effects of disclosure of HIV status,
reported using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Of 957 participants, 500 were matched. In propensity-score matched
analysis, disclosure of HIV status significantly impacts adherence to clinic
visits (OR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.13-2.36) and reduced patient representation (OR =
O.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.76). Sensitivity analysis showed robustness to unmeasured
confounders (Gamma value = 2.2, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Disclosure of HIV status is associated with increased adherence to
clinic visits and lower representation to collect medicines at the clinic.
Disclosure of HIV status should be encouraged to enhance continuity of care among
people living with HIV.
