Restriction of mobility between countries is an important regulatory measure to
combat pandemics such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, PCR 
testing is required to enter the Libyan borders. However, no post-travel
quarantine is employed. In this report, we briefly discuss travel regulations in 
Libya during the COVID-19 pandemic and disease importation by travelers. The
results showed that almost half of the sample travel because of health care and
therapy reasons. Tunisia was the most visited destination mainly for trading and 
business and receiving healthcare. Importantly, 13% of asymptomatic travelers
were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Issues regarding repeated testing among very frequent
travelers and variant importation needs to be addressed in a more efficient
manner.
