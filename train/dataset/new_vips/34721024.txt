Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are considered a promising therapeutic alternative for
cancer. However, despite the development of novel OVs with improved efficacy and 
tumor selectivity, their limited efficacy as monotherapeutic agents remains a
significant challenge. This study extended our previously observed combination
effects of propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, and the T1012G oncolytic virus 
into colorectal cancer models. A cell viability assay showed that cotreatment
could induce synergistic killing effects on human and murine colorectal cell
lines. Moreover, cotreatment caused sustained tumor regression compared with
T1012G monotherapy or propranolol monotherapy in human HCT116 and murine MC38
tumor models. The propranolol activity was not via a direct effect on viral
replication in vitro or in vivo. Western blotting showed that cotreatment
significantly enhanced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in HCT116 and MC38
cells compared with the propranolol or T1012G alone. In addition, propranolol or 
T1012G treatment induced a 35.06% ± 0.53% or 35.49% ± 2.68% reduction in VEGF
secretion in HUVECs (p < 0.01/p < 0.01). Cotreatment further inhibited VEGF
secretion compared with the monotherapies (compared with propranolol treatment:
75.06% ± 1.50% decrease, compared with T1012G treatment: 74.91% ± 0.68%; p＜0.001,
p < 0.001). Consistent with the in vitro results, in vivo data showed that
cotreatment could reduce Ki67 and enhance cleaved caspase 3 and CD31 expression
in human HCT116 and murine MC38 xenografts. In summary, β-blockers could improve 
the therapeutic potential of OVs by enhancing oncolytic virus-mediated killing of
colorectal cancer cells and colorectal tumors.
