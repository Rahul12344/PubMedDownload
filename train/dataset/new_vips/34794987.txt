INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is associated with a marked systemic inflammatory response
with concomitant cardiac injury and remodelling, but it is currently unknown
whether the latter is reversible. Given that high-intensity interval training
(HIIT) is a powerful stimulus to improve cardiorespiratory fitness while also
eliciting marked anti-inflammatory effects, it may be an important countermeasure
of reducing cardiopulmonary morbidity following COVID-19.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 40 COVID-19 survivors who have been discharged from
hospital will be included in this investigator-blinded randomised study with a
12-week HIIT intervention. Patients will be 1:1 block-randomised by sex to either
a supervised HIIT exercise group or standard care (control group). The main
hypothesis is that a 12-week HIIT scheme is a safe way to improve loss of cardiac
mass and associated cardiorespiratory fitness, despite hypothesised limited
HIIT-induced changes in conventional lung function indices per se. Ultimately, we
hypothesise that the HIIT scheme will reduce post-COVID-19 symptoms and improve
quality of life.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Scientific Ethical
Committee at the Capital Region of Denmark (H-20033733, including amendments
75068 and 75799) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04647734, pre-results).
The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, including cases of
positive, negative and inconclusive results.Trial registration number
NCT04549337.
