INTRODUCTION: The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
was imported to Pakistan in February 2020, since then 8,260 deaths have been
witnessed. The virus has been constantly mutating and local transmission cases
from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many
distinct clusters of variant SARS-CoV-2 have been defined globally. In this
study, the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 was studied and locally transmitted
SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any
possible variants.
METHODOLOGY: The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to
confirm SARS-CoV-2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The virus isolates were
sequenced through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from the
first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared.
RESULTS: The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with the highest number
of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged
between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense
mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. 
Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from the
second wave of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally
transmitted virus from Karachi varies from those reported from other parts of
Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from the first and
second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed
trials, therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for
effective vaccine design and/or selection.
