More than a year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term neurological
manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly being reported. The long-term
sequelae of COVID-19-related leukoencephalopathy, however, remain unclear. Here, 
we present long-term neuroimaging follow-up in two cases of COVID-19-related
leukoencephalopathy. The two cases demonstrate the utility of brain MRI for
evaluating neurologic symptoms in critically ill patients with COVID-19, for
diagnosis of underlying neural injury and prognostication of future recovery. The
presence of leukoencephalopathy may result in chronic neurologic manifestations
and may represent a poor prognosticator of neurologic recovery. The presence of
leukoencephalomalacia on follow-up neuroimaging is potentially an indicator of
irreversible white matter damage, which may be associated with more severe
chronic deficits.
