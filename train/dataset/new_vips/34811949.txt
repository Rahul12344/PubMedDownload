The aim of this study was to examine the impact of features of dysmetabolism on
liver disease severity, evolution, and clinical outcomes in a real-life cohort of
patients treated with direct acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection. To this end, we considered 7,007 patients treated between 2014
and 2018, 65.3% with advanced fibrosis, of whom 97.7% achieved viral eradication 
(NAVIGATORE-Lombardia registry). In a subset (n = 748), liver stiffness
measurement (LSM) was available at baseline and follow-up. Higher body mass index
(BMI; odds ratio [OR] 1.06 per kg/m2 , 1.03-1.09) and diabetes (OR 2.01
[1.65-2.46]) were independently associated with advanced fibrosis at baseline,
whereas statin use was protective (OR 0.46 [0.35-0.60]; P < 0.0001 for all). The 
impact of BMI was greater in those without diabetes (P = 0.003). Diabetes was
independently associated with less pronounced LSM improvement after viral
eradication (P = 0.001) and in patients with advanced fibrosis was an independent
predictor of the most frequent clinical events, namely de novo hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC; hazard ratio [HR] 2.09 [1.20-3.63]; P = 0.009) and cardiovascular
events (HR 2.73 [1.16-6.43]; P = 0.021). Metformin showed a protective
association against HCC (HR 0.32 [0.11-0.96]; P = 0.043), which was confirmed
after adjustment for propensity score (P = 0.038). Diabetes diagnosis further
refined HCC prediction in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver
disease at high baseline risk (P = 0.024). Conclusion: Metabolic comorbidities
were associated with advanced liver fibrosis at baseline, whereas statins were
protective. In patients with advanced fibrosis, diabetes increased the risk of de
novo HCC and of cardiovascular events. Optimization of metabolic comorbidities
treatment by a multi-disciplinary management approach may improve cardiovascular 
and possibly liver-related outcomes.
