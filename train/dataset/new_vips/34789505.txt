OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on the effectiveness of public health measures 
in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19
mortality.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, Global Health, and 
World Health Organization COVID-19 database (preprints).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Observational and interventional
studies that assessed the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the
incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was incidence of covid-19.
Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality.
DATA SYNTHESIS: DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to
investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing
measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed 
using Cochran's Q test and the I2 metrics, with two tailed P values.
RESULTS: 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual 
public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a
"package of interventions." Eight of 35 studies were included in the
meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated
with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12,
I2=12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I2=84%), and physical distancing
(0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I2=87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies,
meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation,
universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The
effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several
personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and
physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19.
Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider
community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better
understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19
vaccination.
