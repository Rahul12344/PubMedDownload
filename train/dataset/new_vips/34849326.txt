COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2,
initially originated from China. In response to this serious life-threatening
disease, designing and developing more accurate and sensitive tests are crucial. 
The aim of this study is designing a multi-epitope of spike and nucleocapsid
antigens of COVID-19 virus by bioinformatics methods. The sequences of
nucleotides obtained from the NCBI Nucleotide Database. Transmembrane structures 
of proteins were predicted by TMHMM Server and the prediction of signal peptide
of proteins was performed by Signal P Server. B-cell epitopes' prediction was
performed by the online prediction server of IEDB server. Beta turn structure of 
linear epitopes was also performed using the IEDB server. Conformational epitope 
prediction was performed using the CBTOPE and eventually, eight antigenic
epitopes with high physicochemical properties were selected, and then, all eight 
epitopes were blasted using the NCBI website. The analyses revealed that
α-helices, extended strands, β-turns, and random coils were 28.59%, 23.25%,
3.38%, and 44.78% for S protein, 21.24%, 16.71%, 6.92%, and 55.13% for N Protein,
respectively. The S and N protein three-dimensional structure was predicted using
the prediction I-TASSER server. In the current study, bioinformatics tools were
used to design a multi-epitope peptide based on the type of antigen and its
physiochemical properties and SVM method (Machine Learning) to design
multi-epitopes that have a high avidity against SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to detect
infections by COVID-19.
