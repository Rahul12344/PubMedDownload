Differentiating viral from bacterial infections in febrile children is
challenging and often leads to an unnecessary use of antibiotics. There is a
great need for more accurate diagnostic tools. New molecular methods have
improved the particular diagnostics of viral respiratory tract infections, but
defining etiology can still be challenging, as certain viruses are frequently
detected in asymptomatic children. For the detection of bacterial infections,
time consuming cultures with limited sensitivity are still the gold standard. As 
a response to infection, the immune system elicits a cascade of events, which
aims to eliminate the invading pathogen. Recent studies have focused on these
host-pathogen interactions to identify pathogen-specific biomarkers (gene
expression profiles), or "pathogen signatures", as potential future diagnostic
tools. Other studies have assessed combinations of traditional bacterial and
viral biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukins, myxovirus resistance protein 
A, procalcitonin, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) to
establish etiology. In this review we discuss the performance of such novel
diagnostics and their potential role in clinical praxis. In conclusion, there are
several promising novel biomarkers in the pipeline, but well-designed randomized 
controlled trials are needed to evaluate the safety of using these novel
biomarkers to guide clinical decisions.
