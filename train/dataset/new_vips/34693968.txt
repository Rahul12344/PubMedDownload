BACKGROUND: Although COVID-19 vaccinations have provided a significant reduction 
in infections, effective COVID-19 treatments remain an urgent need.
METHODS: Functional characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune
immunoglobulin (hIG) from human convalescent plasma was performed by different
virus neutralization methodologies (plaque reduction, virus induced cytotoxicity,
TCID50 reduction and immunofluorimetry) at different laboratories using
geographically different SARS-CoV-2 isolates (USA (1), Italy (1), Spain (2): 2
containing the D614G mutation). Neutralization capacity against the original
Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants (D614G mutant, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351) was
evaluated using a pseudovirus expressing the corresponding spike (S) protein.
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular
phagocytosis (ADCP) was also evaluated.
RESULTS: All SARS-CoV-2 isolates were potently neutralized by hIG as shown by all
four methodologies. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were effectively
neutralized using the pseudovirus. hIG induced ADCC and ADCP against SARS-CoV-2 N
and S proteins but not E protein. Very low concentrations (25-100 µg IgG/mL) were
required. A potent effect was triggered by antibodies in hIG solutions against
the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Beyond neutralization, IgG Fc-dependent pathways may play a role in 
combatting SARS-CoV-2 infections using COVID-19 hIG. This could be especially
relevant for the treatment of more neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants.
