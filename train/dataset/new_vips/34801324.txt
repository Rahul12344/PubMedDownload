BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since the end of 2019, the world has been dealing with a new
crisis caused by the widespread and global outbreak of the coronavirus that has
affected various aspects of life. The stay-at-home orders issued to prevent the
virus from spreading have caused many problems for families, such as obesity and 
overweight, particularly among children. As parents play a key role in the
prevention of childhood obesity, the present qualitative study aimed to examine
the experiences of parents regarding the obesity or overweight of their children 
during the outbreak of coronavirus.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was performed using a qualitative descriptive
approach. The sampling method was purposeful, and the required data were
collected through in-depth, unstructured, and face-to-face interviews with 16
parents of children with obesity or overweight. The interviews were digitally
recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Graneheim and Lundman
conventional content analysis approach.
RESULTS: The findings were divided into five main themes, including overeating
while stuck at home, leading to the sedentary life, disturbed sleep-wake rhythm
of the children, indifference of the children towards their appearance, and the
inability of parents to control the obesity of their children.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected families of children with obesity
in various ways. The experiences of such parents provide new insight into
parental struggles around managing their child's obesity particularly during such
stressful times.
IMPLICATIONS: An in-depth study of the experiences of the parents and perception 
of their challenges and concerns about childhood obesity during the COVID-19
pandemic can lead to the development of useful and effective strategies for the
control of childhood obesity.
