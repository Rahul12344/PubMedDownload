Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are a group of
evolutionarily conserved proteins and show emerging roles in mediating protein
trafficking and signaling transduction. Although, several studies showed that
MCTPs play important roles during plant growth and development, their biological 
functions in cotton remain largely unknown. Here, we identify and characterize 33
GhMCTP genes from upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and reveal the diverse
expression patterns of GhMCTPs in various tissues. We also find that GhMCTP7,
GhMCTP12, and GhMCTP17 are highly expressed in the main stem apex, suggesting
their possible roles in shoot development. Through analyzing different cotton
species, we discover plant heights are closely related to the expression levels
of GhMCTP7, GhMCTP12, and GhMCTP17. Furthermore, we silence the expression of
GhMCTP genes using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system in cotton and find 
that GhMCTP7, GhMCTP12, and GhMCTP17 play an essential role in shoot meristem
development. GhMCTPs interact with GhKNAT1 and GhKNAT2 and regulate meristem
development through integrating multiple signal pathways. Taken together, our
results demonstrate functional redundancy of GhMCTPs in cotton shoot meristem
development and provide a valuable resource to further study various functions of
GhMCTPs in plant growth and development.
