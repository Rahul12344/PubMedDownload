The current pneumonia outbreak, which began in early December 2019 near Wuhan
City, Hubei Province, China, is caused by a novel corona virus (CoV) known as
'2019-nCoV' or '2019 novel corona virus or COVID-19' by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Vaccines are available to prevent corona virus contagious
infection or to reduce the viral load in body but virus is continuously mutating 
itself to infect people at severity. In this critical scenario this review
provide a compiled study for techniques and tools that can be used to treat
corona virus infections and its variants by some modern techniques and natural
products such as inhibitors, siRNA technique and plant based approaches. This
review focuses on healthy treatment and strategies that can be used effectively
to treat the disease globally by reducing the post COVID symptoms.
