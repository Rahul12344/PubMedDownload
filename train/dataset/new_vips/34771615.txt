Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite many signs of
progress, currently available cancer treatments often do not provide desired
outcomes for too many cancers. Therefore, newer and more effective therapeutic
approaches are needed. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) have emerged as a novel cancer
treatment modality, which selectively targets and kills cancer cells while
sparing normal ones. In the past several decades, many different OV candidates
have been developed and tested in both laboratory settings as well as in cancer
patient clinical trials. Many approaches have been taken to overcome the
limitations of OVs, including engineering OVs to selectively activate anti-tumor 
immune responses. However, newer approaches like the combination of OVs with
current immunotherapies to convert "immune-cold" tumors to "immune-hot" will
almost certainly improve the potency of OVs. Here, we discuss strategies that are
explored to further improve oncolytic virotherapy.
