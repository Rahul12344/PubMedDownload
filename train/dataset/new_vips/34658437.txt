Importance: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine visits increased to
provide safer access to healthcare.
Methods: To evaluate the role of telemedicine in obesity management during
COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review to identify barriers in using this
approach to patient care.
Conclusion: While necessary, the management of obesity through telemedicine was
met with patient-specific and healthcare-specific barriers. Increased awareness
of these barriers may allow physicians to better understand patient interactions 
via virtual medical visits.
