BACKGROUND: COVID-19 emerged as a serious pandemic in 2019 and billions of people
were infected. Various precautionary methods were taken to contain the spread of 
virus such as social distancing, public lockdown, sanitation, and closure of
schools and colleges. Many colleges started online classes to resume their
syllabus and to complete the course curriculum. These evening online sessions
resulted in late night sleep, long term mobile/computer exposure, and disturbed
sleep pattern.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 online
classes on morningness- eveningness personality and to compare it with different 
age groups, gender, and body mass index.
METHODS: The cluster sampling method was used to collect the subjects from the
total of 1153 adult college students, 897 subjects were selected based on the
selection criteria and instructed to submit an online survey consists of the
Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire and demographic and anthropometric data
through mail, social media, or through a researcher by direct interview.
RESULTS: The mean score for the 897 participants is 56.7, indicating intermediate
morningness-eveningness personality type. On comparing the different groups, the 
youngest group (18-20 years) scored 4.23%(mean = 46.7), female subjects scored
6.13%(mean = 58.1), the underweight 2.67%(mean = 59.2) and overweight groups
scored 2.89%(mean = 59.7) indicating definite eveningness. Among the 897
collected samples of the population 8.13%of the subjects experienced definite
eveningness, 14.93%has moderate eveningness, 17.38%are under intermediate
category, 22.4%have moderate morningness, and 37.11%have definite morningness.
