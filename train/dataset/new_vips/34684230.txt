Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis.
Polymorphism in bovine lymphocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 alleles is related to
susceptibility to BLV proviral load (PVL), which is a useful index for estimating
disease progression and transmission risk. However, whether differential
BoLA-DRB3 affects BLV infectivity remains unknown. In a three-year follow-up
investigation using a luminescence syncytium induction assay for evaluating BLV
infectivity, we visualized and evaluated the kinetics of BLV infectivity in
cattle with susceptible, resistant and neutral BoLA-DRB3 alleles which were
selected from 179 cattle. Susceptible cattle showed stronger BLV infectivity than
both resistant and neutral cattle. The order of intensity of BLV infectivity was 
as follows: susceptible cattle > neutral cattle > resistant cattle. BLV
infectivity showed strong positive correlation with PVL at each testing point.
BLV-infected susceptible cattle were found to be at higher risk of horizontal
transmission, as they had strong infectivity and high PVL, whereas BLV-infected
resistant cattle were low risk of BLV transmission owing to weak BLV infection
and low PVL. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate that the BoLA-DRB3
polymorphism is associated with BLV infection.
