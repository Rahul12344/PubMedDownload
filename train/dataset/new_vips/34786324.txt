Purpose of Review: To summarize outcomes to date, as well as important
considerations and unanswered questions related to the use of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) positive donors for heart transplantation.
Recent Findings: Outcomes from single-center studies and registry data to date
suggest that among patients who develop donor-transmitted HCV after heart
transplantation, direct-acting antiviral therapies (DAAT) are effective and
well-tolerated, and that short-term survival is similar to that of patients
transplanted with HCV - donors.
Summary: In an era marked by increasing numbers of HCV positive deceased donors
and a growing imbalance between the demand and supply of donor hearts,
utilization of HCV + donors is a feasible strategy to expand the donor pool and
reduce waitlist times. Ongoing work is needed to clarify longer-term outcomes
with the use of this strategy.
