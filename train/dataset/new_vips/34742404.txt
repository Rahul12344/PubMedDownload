Previous researches suggested that polysaccharides from brown algae had
anti-virus activity. We hypothesized that nature polysaccharide from marine
plants might have the effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. By high throughput
screening to target 3CLpro enzyme using polysaccharides library, we discover a
crude polysaccharide 375 from seaweed Ecklonia kurome blocked 3CLpro enzymatic
activity and shows good anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in cell. Further, we
show that homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from the 375 may bind to 3CLpro well
and disturb spike protein binding to ACE2 receptor. The structure
characterization uncovers that 37502 is alginate. These results imply that the
bioactivities of 375 on SARS-CoV-2 may target multiple key molecules implicated
in the virus infection and replication. The above results suggest that 375 may be
a potential drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2.
