The COVID-19 pandemic is still threatening us, our patients, and the global
health care system. Since the first outbreak at the end of 2019 in China, it
became rapidly clear that a new variant of a SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, is
threatening our human society worldwide. Since then, the scientific community has
accumulated an incredibly large amount of knowledge about the pathophysiology of 
this virus, primarily affecting the respiratory tract and, in severe cases,
subsequently resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ 
failure due to uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response syndrome.1 2.
