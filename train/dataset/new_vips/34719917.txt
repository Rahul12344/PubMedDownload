2-Cyanoacrylates are a unique class of compounds with high photosystem II
electron transport inhibitory activity. Through the in-depth study of molecular
design, synthesis, biological activity, structure-activity relationship, and
action mechanism, a large number of 2-cyanoacrylate derivatives with excellent
herbicidal activity were found. In addition, 2-cyanoacrylate derivatives with
different substituents have also been found to have good fungicidal or anti-plant
virus activities. To further guide the design and development of new pesticide
candidates, the representative research work of 2-cyanoacrylate derivatives with 
herbicidal, fungicidal, and anti-plant virus activities was reviewed.
