Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are macromolecular structures programmed to
trap circulating bacteria and viruses. The accumulation of NETs in the
circulation correlates with the formation of anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA
antibodies and is considered a causative factor for systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). The digestion of DNA by DNase1 and DNases1L3 is the rate- limiting factor 
for NET accumulation. Mutations occurring in one of these two DNase genes
determine anti-DNA formation and are associated with severe Lupus-like syndromes 
and lupus nephritis (LN). A second mechanism that may lead to DNase functional
impairment is the presence of circulating DNase inhibitors in patients with low
DNase activity, or the generation of anti-DNase antibodies. This phenomenon has
been described in a relevant number of patients with SLE and may represent an
important mechanism determining autoimmunity flares. On the basis of the reviewed
studies, it is tempting to suppose that the blockade or selective depletion of
anti-DNase autoantibodies could represent a potential novel therapeutic approach 
to prevent or halt SLE and LN. In general, strategies aimed at reducing NET
formation might have a similar impact on the progression of SLE and LN.
