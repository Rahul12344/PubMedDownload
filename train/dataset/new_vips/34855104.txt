BACKGROUND: Poor connections in the cascade of viral hepatitis care have been
discussed around the world. In 2011 in Japan, 500,000 to 1.25 million hepatitis B
and C virus carriers needed to consult with hepatologists, so linkage-to-care
(LTC) needs to be promoted. Therefore, in this study, to improve LTC and
care-seeking behaviors, we attempted to establish a community-based intervention 
system and evaluate its effectiveness by analyzing behavior modifications.
METHODS: In a model city, Okazaki (population: 387,887 as of 2019), LTC was
encouraged among HBV and HCV carriers by annually mailed brochures, and their
care-seeking behaviors were followed up through questionnaires for 8 years
(2012-2019). Their behavior modifications and demographic characteristics were
analyzed anonymously in cooperation with community health workers, hepatologists,
and researchers.
RESULTS: Through regional HBsAg and anti-HCV screening, 333 HBV and 208 HCV
carriers were identified. Before the intervention, only 34.7% (25/72) of HBV- and
34.3% (24/70) of HCV-positive individuals had consulted with hepatologists.
However, in 2019, after the intervention, these proportions increased to 79.8%
(91/114) and 91.2% (52/57), respectively. Access to outpatient care and treatment
uptake also continuously improved. However, individuals over 70 years of age were
significantly less likely to engage in care-seeking behaviors (p < 0.05), and
significantly fewer HCV-positive females received treatment (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: A paper-based reiterative intervention encouraging LTC and follow-up
successfully improved the care-seeking behaviors of hepatitis virus-positive
individuals and enabled their behavior modifications to be monitored. Further
trials are required to advance the system by age- and gender-specific
interventions.
