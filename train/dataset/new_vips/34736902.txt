Elevated blood biotin levels may interfere with some biotin-streptavidin
immunoassays, used in clinical laboratories to aid diagnosis. The objective of
this study was to determine the prevalence of elevated blood biotin levels in
three at risk patient cohorts, where misclassification of disease status would
have a high clinical impact. This retrospective, single-center study screened
residual, de-identified plasma samples (N = 700) from adult patients undergoing
routine thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (n = 500), procalcitonin (PCT)
(n = 100), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n = 100) testing using the
Elecsys® BRAHMS PCT (Roche Diagnostics), Access TSH (3rd IS) (Beckman Coulter
Inc), and ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo (Abbott Laboratories) immunoassays,
respectively, for elevated levels of biotin (quantified by gas
chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry). Patients taking biotin
supplements were included and dosages recorded from medical records. In the
overall study cohort, blood biotin levels ranged 0.1-21.3 ng/mL; 44.3% (310/700) 
of samples were < 1 ng/mL, 54.7% (383/700) were 1-<10 ng/mL, and 1% (7/700)
were ≥ 10 ng/mL. The sub-cohorts had similar ranges of biotin levels:
0.5-21.3 ng/mL (TSH), 0.1-12.1 ng/mL (PCT), and 0.3-7.3 ng/mL (HIV). In the 44
patients (6.3% of overall study cohort) who were documented as taking biotin
supplements (range of doses, 2.5-10 mg/day), blood biotin levels ranged
0.9-21.3 ng/mL; 2.3% (1/44) of samples were < 1 ng/mL, 86.4% (38/44) were
1-<10 ng/mL, and 11.4% (5/44) were ≥ 10 ng/mL. Most patients who reported taking 
biotin supplements had blood biotin levels ≥ 1 ng/mL and the highest blood biotin
level detected was 21.3 ng/mL.
