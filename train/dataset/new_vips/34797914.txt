West Nile virus (WNV) is pathogenic in a wide range of avian hosts and is endemic
in much of North America. This virus is responsible for population declines of
some Passeriformes. We describe a WNV-associated mortality event in American
White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) nestlings. This is a species, inherent to the
Everglades ecosystem, which has recently begun nesting in urban areas. An urban
colony in south Florida was monitored from March-July in 2020 as part of an
ongoing study. Nestling carcasses were collected opportunistically and sent to
the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, University of Georgia within
24 h for diagnosis. Three ibis nestling deaths were confirmed to be caused by WNV
infection based on histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and reverse
transcription PCR. Serial plasma samples collected weekly from 36 healthy chicks 
of the same urban rookery were tested for WNV-neutralizing antibodies via plaque 
reduction neutralization test; four chicks were seropositive. Antibody titers in 
three seropositive chicks from which serial samples were collected waned over
time, suggesting maternal antibody transfer. Ibis mortalities were consistent
with a spike of WNV activity in this region of Florida. West Nile virus infection
may be an important seasonal cause of mortality for wading bird nestlings.
