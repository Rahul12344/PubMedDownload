Sj√∂gren syndrome (SS) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease
characterized by dry mouth and dry eyes, and characteristic autoantibodies.
Evidence of altered macroautophagy/autophagy and apoptosis has been associated
with SS, but a mechanistic understanding of the gene expression changes
associated with these abnormal processes has not been realized. Recently,
increased LAMP3 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 3) expression was found in
a subset of SS patients and was associated with increased apoptosis and
autoantigen accumulation and release. To better understand how LAMP3 expression
might modulate apoptosis, cell biology, and biochemical studies were used to
examine the effect of LAMP3 expression in minor salivary gland cells. LAMP3
expression resulted in degradation of LAMP1 increasing lysosomal membrane
permeabilization and relocalization of cathepsins to the cytoplasm, resulting in 
destabilizing autophagic flux and caspase activation. These findings highlight
the central role of LAMP3 expression in the pathogenesis of SS.
