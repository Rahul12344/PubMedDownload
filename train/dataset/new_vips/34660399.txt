An epidemic that occurs worldwide, involving many countries and affecting a large
population is called as a pandemic. The ongoing corona virus disease (COVID-19)
pandemic has not only adversely affected the global healthcare infrastructure,
but has significantly impacted world economy, socio-political and cultural
environment. There are 219 different types of viruses, known at present to be
able to infect human beings. This number is just a tip of the iceberg, with the
possibility of a substantial pool of undiscovered human viruses and millions of
other virus species (which affect plants and non-human animals) that can be
potentially infectious to humans as well. Throughout human history there have
been numerous pandemics and disease outbreaks that have not only led to huge loss
of life, but also hindered economic growth and development. Therefore, in this
review article we wanted to highlight major viral pandemics that have occurred in
the last two decades, to understand factors contributing to their emergence,
transmission and suggest ways to curb future outbreaks.
