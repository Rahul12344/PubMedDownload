The inflammatory response plays a central role in the complications of congenital
pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) and severe coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the transcriptional changes
induced by SARS-CoV-2 exposure in pediatric MSCs derived from pediatric lung
(MSCs-lung) and CPAM tissues (MSCs-CPAM) in order to elucidate potential pathways
involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a condition of exacerbated inflammatory
response. MSCs-lung and MSCs-CPAM do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TRMPSS2). SARS-CoV-2 appears to be
unable to replicate in MSCs-CPAM and MSCs-lung. MSCs-lung and MSCs-CPAM
maintained the expression of stemness markers MSCs-lung show an inflammatory
response (IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, and CXCL10), and the activation of Notch3
non-canonical pathway; this route appears silent in MSCs-CPAM, and cytokine genes
expression is reduced. Decreased value of p21 in MSCs-lung suggested no cell
cycle block, and cells did not undergo apoptosis. MSCs-lung appears to increase
genes associated with immunomodulatory function but could contribute to
inflammation, while MSCs-CPAM keeps stable or reduce the immunomodulatory
receptors expression, but they also reduce their cytokines expression. These data
indicated that, independently from their perilesional or cystic origin, the MSCs 
populations already present in a patient affected with CPAM are not permissive
for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and they will not spread the disease in case of infection. 
Moreover, these MSCs will not undergo apoptosis when they come in contact with
SARS-CoV-2; on the contrary, they maintain their staminality profile.
