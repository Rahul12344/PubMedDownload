Background: The coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is likely 
to put healthcare professionals across the world in an unprecedented situation.
Methods: A total of 683 healthcare workers were recruited in this study. Short
form-12 items (SF-12), Societal Influences Survey Questionnaire (SISQ), and
Disaster-Related Psychological Screening Test (DRPST) were used to survey
participants. Multiple linear regression and structural equation model (SEM) were
used to explore the possible factors to the societal influences and quality of
life. Results: After multiple linear regression analysis, female, older, more
education years, married, regular intake, and posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) frequency had positive association with SISQ. To physical component
summary (PCS) of SF-12, chronic illness, sleep score, PTSD frequency, and social 
distance had negative association, and exercise habits had positive association. 
A mental component summary (MCS) value of SF-12, age, participate in social
activities, and social information had positive association, and PTSD frequency, 
sleep score, social anxiety, and depression had negative association. Under SEM
analysis, PTSD had positive influence on SISQ. Sleep score and MCS value had
negative influences on SISQ. PTSD severity, older age, sleep score, smoking, and 
nursing staff had negative influences on PCS value. Young age, PTSD frequency,
sleep score, and depression had negative influences on MCS value. Conclusion:
Healthcare team members with severe PTSD symptoms suffered more societal
influences. Relative to PTSD severity, PTSD frequency was more important to the
quality of life. Members of older age who frequently participate in clubs,
volunteers, or charity activities had better mental life quality.
