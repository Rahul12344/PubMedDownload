The complement system, as a vital part of innate immunity, has an important role 
in the clearance of pathogens; however, unregulated activation of this system
probably has a key role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, which is
induced by highly pathogenic viruses (i.e. influenza A viruses and severe acute
respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus). The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which
is the causal agent for the ongoing global pandemic of the coronavirus disease
2019 (Covid-19), has recently been spread to almost all countries around the
world. Although most people are immunocompetent to SARS-CoV-2, a small group
develops hyper-inflammation that leads to complications like acute respiratory
distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ
failure. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the complement system exerts a
crucial role in this inflammatory reaction. Additionally, patients with the
severe form of Covid-19 show over-activation of the complement in their skin,
sera, and lungs. This study aims to summarise current knowledge concerning the
interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the complement system and to critically appraise
complement inhibition as a potential new approach for Covid-19 treatment.
