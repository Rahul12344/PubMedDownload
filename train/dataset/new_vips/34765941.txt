Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disorder primarily of viral
etiology, though multiple cofactors are also responsible. Human herpes virus-8, a
gamma herpes virus, is considered to be the causative agent. Acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome-associated KS has different clinical pictures than
those seen in other types of KS. As it progresses rapidly, early institution of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after proper diagnosis is expected. 
Though HAART has reduced the prevalence of KS in HIV disease, HAART has not
eliminated the disease. Here, we report a case who is HIV 1 and hepatitis B
surface antigen positive with numerous violaceous plaques over the face, upper
extremities, and trunk along with oral mucosal involvement. He had received ten
sessions of electron beam radiotherapy on the face, and the facial lesions have
healed with residual hyperpigmentation.
