OBJECTIVES: To evaluate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) spread inside the healthcare setting using environmental sampling
and indoor air quality (IAQ) parameters.
METHODS: Ward/ICU rooms had IAQ parameters monitored in real-time, including
volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Surface and three air samples 
with different exposure times were collected in each room and tested for
SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative Rt-PCR. Environmental sampling and IAQ data were
compared to provide information about viral spread.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 6/10 rooms and 9/30 air samples, which is
proportionally higher than previous studies. Sampling time confirmed to be
crucial to viral detection. No correlations between IAQ parameters could be
associated with positive/negative samples even when aerosol-generating procedures
were performed.
CONCLUSION: Environmental sampling of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be used as an indicator 
of occupational safety. IAQ is also a potential tool but requires further
research.
