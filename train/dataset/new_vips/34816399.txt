Vaccines are the most effective and economic way of combating poultry viruses.
However, the use of traditional live-attenuated poultry vaccines has problems
such as antigenic differences with the currently circulating strains of viruses
and the risk of reversion to virulence. In veterinary medicine, reverse genetics 
is applied to solve these problems by developing genotype-matched vaccines,
better attenuated and effective live vaccines, broad-spectrum vaccine vectors,
bivalent vaccines, and genetically tagged recombinant vaccines that facilitate
the serological differentiation of vaccinated animals from infected animals. In
this chapter, we discuss reverse genetics as a tool for the development of
recombinant vaccines against economically devastating poultry viruses.
