Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: A Strategy to Address Pandemic-Induced Anxiety.

Surmai M, Duff E.

Mental health morbidity has increased amid the COVID-19 pandemic due to social
isolation, impairment of basic needs, financial instability, and fears of the
virus. New cases of anxiety and depression have been on the rise, while
preexisting mental and chronic illnesses have been exacerbated. Cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly flexible technique used to manage an array
of mental illnesses. CBT may be of particular benefit under conditions of social 
isolation and virtual health care delivery. This report addresses the critical
role of nurse practitioners in navigating effective CBT for mental wellness.
