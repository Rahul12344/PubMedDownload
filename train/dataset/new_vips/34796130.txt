Background: ABO and Rh blood group systems are associated with many diseases
including cancerous, infectious, non-infectious, bacterial and viral diseases.
Studies have shown association of blood groups A and O with higher and lower odds
for coronavirus disease 2019 positivity, respectively.
Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective study conducted at Sir Ganga Ram 
Hospital, Delhi. We investigated the association of ABO and Rh blood groups with 
susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 infection, severity of disease,
recovery period, and mortality of patients. Patients were enrolled from April 8, 
2020 to October 4, 2020. A total of 2,586 real-time PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were recruited. Data was analyzed
using chi-square test, odds ratio, and Mann-Whitney test to determine the
association of blood groups.
Results: In the 2,586 COVID-19-infected patients, the frequencies of A, B, O, and
AB were 29.93%, 41.80%, 21.19%, and 7.98%, respectively. Of the patients, 98.07% 
were Rh positive. Blood group A (odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 1.40-1.66; p < 0.001) and 
B (odds ratio, 1.15; CI, 1.06-1.24; p < 0.001) is observed to be significantly
associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, whereas blood group O (odds ratio, 0.65;
CI, 0.59-0.71; p < 0.001) and AB (odds ratio, 0.66; CI, 0.59-0.71; p < 0.001)
have low risk of COVID-19 infection.
Conclusion: A, B, and Rh+ are found to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection,
whereas blood groups O, AB, and Rh- are at a lower risk of COVID-19 infection. No
association was found between blood groups and susceptibility to severity of
disease and mortality.
