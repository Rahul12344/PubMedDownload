Lipid-based nanoparticles have been applied extensively in drug delivery and
vaccine strategies and are finding diverse applications in the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-from vaccine-component encapsulation to modeling
the virus, itself. High-throughput, highly flexible methods for characterization 
are of great benefit to the development of liposomes featuring surface proteins. 
DNA-directed patterning is one such method that offers versatility in
immobilizing and segregating lipid-based nanoparticles for subsequent analysis.
Here, oligonucleotides are selectively conjugated onto a glass substrate and then
hybridized to complementary oligonucleotides tagged to liposomes, patterning them
with great control and precision. The power of DNA-directed patterning is
demonstrated by characterizing a novel recapitulative lipid-based nanoparticle
model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)-S-liposomes-that presents the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on its
surface. Patterning a mixture of S-liposomes and liposomes that display the
tetraspanin CD63 to discrete regions of a substrate shows that
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) specifically binds to S-liposomes.
Subsequent introduction of S-liposomes to ACE2-expressing cells tests the
biological function of S-liposomes and shows agreement with DNA-directed
patterning-based assays. Finally, multiplexed patterning of S-liposomes verifies 
the performance of commercially available neutralizing antibodies against the two
S variants. Overall, DNA-directed patterning enables a wide variety of custom
assays for the characterization of any lipid-based nanoparticle.
