The human Betacoronavirus OC43 is a common cause of respiratory viral infections 
in adults and children. Lung infections with OC43 are associated with mortality, 
especially in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Neutralizing
antibodies play a major role in protection against many respiratory viral
infections, but to date a live viral neutralization assay for OC43 has not been
described. We isolated a human monoclonal antibody (OC2) that binds to the spike 
protein of OC43 and neutralizes the live virus derived from the original isolate 
of OC43. We used this monoclonal antibody to develop and test the performance of 
two readily accessible in vitro assays for measuring antibody neutralization, one
utilizing cytopathic effect and another utilizing an ELISA of infected cells. We 
used both methods to measure the neutralizing activity of the OC2 monoclonal
antibody and of human plasma. These assays could prove useful for studying
humoral responses to OC43 and cross-neutralization with other medically important
betacoronaviruses.
