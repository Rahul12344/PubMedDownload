Cancer patients are exposed to a greater risk of COVID-19 infection, resulting in
treatment delays and unnecessary hospitalizations. International authorities have
suggested reducing visits to hospitals and guarantee continuity of care. We
developed a home care project called Home Se-Cure (HSC) to guarantee the
continuity of oral, intramuscular, and subcutaneous cancer therapy during
COVID-19. The Home Se-Cure project included cancer patients living near Galliera 
Hospital. Patients received home visits by registered nurses (RNs), whoperformed 
blood tests and delivered cancer therapies. Patients were instructed to take
drugs after blood test results and therapy confirmation by oncologists. Sixty-six
patients decided to participate and 38 declined the service. A customer
satisfaction questionnaire was administered to a subgroup of patients
participating in the project. The most prevalent disease in the HSC group was
prostate cancer. The mean age of the patients in HSC was 78.4 years and 68.9 in
the decliner group. The majority of the HSC participants appreciated the project 
because they could stay at home (71%) and reduce the risk of COVID-19 contagion
(67.7%). Compared to decliners, the time the study group saved was 2033 hours.
HSC guaranteed the continuity of care during the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing
the number of patients in the hospital and avoiding crowds in the waiting room.
