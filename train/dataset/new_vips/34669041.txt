Simian varicella virus (SVV) was first isolated in 1966 from African green
monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) imported from Nairobi, Kenya, to the Liverpool
School of Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom (UK) (Clarkson et al., Arch
Gesamte Virusforsch 22:219-234, 1967). SVV infection caused severe disease that
resulted in a 56% case fatality rate (CFR) in the imported animals within 48 h of
the appearance of a varicella-like rash (Clarkson et al., Arch Gesamte
Virusforsch 22:219-234, 1967; Hemme et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg 94:1095-1099,
2016). The deceased animals presented with fever, widespread vesicular rash, and 
multiple hemorrhagic foci throughout the lungs, liver, and spleen (Clarkson et
al., Arch Gesamte Virusforsch 22:219-234, 1967). This outbreak was quickly
followed by a second outbreak in 47 patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) imported
from Chad and Nigeria by Glaxo Laboratories (London, England, UK), which quickly 
spread within the facility (McCarthy et al., Lancet 2:856-857, 1968).
