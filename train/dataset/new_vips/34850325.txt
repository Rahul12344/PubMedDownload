BACKGROUND & AIMS: Immunotherapy with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific TCR
redirected T (HBV-TCR-T) cells in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) 
patients after liver transplantation was reported to be safe and had potential
therapeutic efficacy. We aim to investigate the safety of HBV-TCR-T-cell
immunotherapy in advanced HBV-HCC patients who had not met the criteria for liver
transplantation.
METHODS: We enrolled eight patients with advanced HBV-HCC and adoptively
transferred short-lived autologous T cells expressing HBV-specific TCR to perform
an open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study (NCT03899415). The primary endpoint 
was to evaluate the safety of HBV-TCR-T-cell therapy according to National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03) during
the dose-escalation process. The secondary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of
HBV-TCR-T-cell therapy by evaluating the anti-tumor responses using RECIST
criteria (version 1.1) and the overall survival.
RESULTS: Adverse events were observed in two participants among the 8 patients
enrolled. Only one patient experienced a Grade 3 liver-related adverse event
after receiving a dose of 1 × 105 HBV-TCR-T cells/kg, then normalized without
interventions with immunosuppressive agents. Among the patients, one achieved a
partial response lasting for 27.7 months. Importantly, most of the patients
exhibited a reduction or stabilization of circulating HBsAg and HBV DNA levels
after HBV-TCR-T-cell infusion, indicating the on-target effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoptive transfer of HBV-TCR-T cells into advanced HBV-HCC
patients were generally safe and well-tolerated. Observations of clinical
efficacy support the continued development and eventual application of this
treatment strategy in patients with advanced HBV-related HCC.
CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT03899415).
