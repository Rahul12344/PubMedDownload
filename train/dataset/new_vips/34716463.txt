An important mechanism of oncolytic virotherapy in ameliorating cancer
immunotherapy is by inducing significant changes in the immune landscape in the
tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite this notion and the potential therapeutic
implications, a comprehensive analysis of the immune changes in carcinomas
induced by virotherapy has not yet been elucidated. We conducted single-cell RNA 
sequencing analysis on carcinomas treated with an HSV-2-based oncolytic virus to 
characterize the immunogenic changes in the TME. We specifically analyzed and
compared the immune cell composition between viral treated and untreated tumors. 
We also applied CellChat to analyze the complex interactions among the
infiltrated immune cells. Our data revealed significant infiltration of B cells
in addition to other important immune cells, including CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells
following virotherapy. Further analysis identified distinct subset compositions
of the infiltrated immune cells and their activation status upon virotherapy. The
intensive interactions among the infiltrated immune cells as revealed by CellChat
analysis may further shape the immune landscape in favor of generating antitumor 
immunity. Our findings will facilitate the design of new strategies in
incorporating immunotherapy into virotherapy for clinical translation. Moreover, 
the significant infiltration of B cells makes it suitable for combining
virotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
