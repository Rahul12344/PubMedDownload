Patients with multiple myeloma frequently present with substantial immune
impairment and an increased risk for infections and infection-related mortality. 
The risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and resulting mortality is also
increased, emphasising the importance of protecting patients by vaccination.
Available data in patients with multiple myeloma suggest a suboptimal
anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, meaning a proportion of patients are
unprotected. Factors associated with poor response are uncontrolled disease,
immunosuppression, concomitant therapy, more lines of therapy, and CD38
antibody-directed and B-cell maturation antigen-directed therapy. These facts
suggest that monitoring the immune response to vaccination in patients with
multiple myeloma might provide guidance for clinical management, such as
administration of additional doses of the same or another vaccine, or even
temporary treatment discontinuation, if possible. In those who do not exhibit a
good response, prophylactic treatment with neutralising monoclonal antibody
cocktails might be considered. In patients deficient of a SARS-CoV-2 immune
response, adherence to measures for infection risk reduction is particularly
recommended. This consensus was generated by members of the European Multiple
Myeloma Network and some external experts. The panel members convened in virtual 
meetings and conducted an extensive literature research and evaluated recently
published data and work presented at meetings, as well as findings from their own
studies. The outcome of the discussions on establishing consensus recommendations
for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with multiple myeloma was condensed into
this Review.
