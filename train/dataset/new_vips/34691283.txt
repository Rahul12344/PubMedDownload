Objective: To assess association between congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection and brain injury in neonates.
Methods: The literatures from inception to November 4, 2020, were searched
through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Heterogeneity test 
was conducted for each indicator and measured by I 2 statistics. If I 2 ≥ 50%,
the random effects model was applied; otherwise, the fixed effects model was
used. Sensitivity analysis was performed for all models. Weighed mean difference 
(WMD) was used as the effect size for measurement data, and risk ratio (RR) was
as the effect indicator.
Results: A total of 13 studies, including 4,262 congenital CMV infection
neonates, were enrolled in this study. Our results showed that the rate of
hearing impairment (RR: 2.105, 95% CI: (1.115, 3.971), P = 0.002), sensorineural 
hearing loss (SNHL) (RR: 17.051, 95% CI: (6.201, 46.886), P < 0.001), and
microcephaly (RR: 2.283, 95% CI: (1.325, 3.935), P =0.003) in neonates infected
congenital CMV was higher than that in control group.
Conclusion: The risks of hearing impairment, SNHL, and microcephaly in neonates
during childhood may be associated with congenital CMV infection. It is necessary
to establish neonatal screening programs and comprehensive diagnostic tests for
patients to reduce the risk of adverse brain damage to the congenital CMV
infection as early as possible and to improve the prognosis of the newborn.
