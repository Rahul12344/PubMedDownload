TAXONOMY: Potato virus X is the type-member of the plant-infecting Potexvirus
genus in the family Alphaflexiviridae.
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES: Potato virus X (PVX) virions are flexuous filaments
460-480 nm in length. Virions are 13 nm in diameter and have a helical pitch of
3.4 nm. The genome is approximately 6.4 kb with a 5' cap and 3' poly(A) terminus.
PVX contains five open reading frames, four of which are essential for
cell-to-cell and systemic movement. One protein encodes the viral replicase.
Cellular inclusions, known as X-bodies, occur near the nucleus of virus-infected 
cells.
HOSTS: The primary host is potato, but it infects a wide range of dicots.
Diagnostic hosts include Datura stramonium and Nicotiana tabacum. PVX is
transmitted in nature by mechanical contact. USEFUL WEBSITE:
