Marine and brackish water aquacultures are rapidly expanding in the Mediterranean
basin. In this context, Egypt recently received a shipment of a 1.5 million
juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) from European Mediterranean
facility. Within a few weeks of their arrival, 95% of the imported fish developed
nodules on their skin and fins that lasted for several months. This study was
undertaken to describe the clinical disease course, to identify the causative
agent, and to investigate its origin. Preliminary diagnosis based on gross
lesions and postmortem examination suggested lymphocystis disease (LCD), caused
by the lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV; genus Lymphocystivirus, family
Iridoviridae). Histopathological and ultrastructural features were typical of
LCDV infections. PCR followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a 306-bp
fragment of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene demonstrated the presence of LCDV
genotype I, originally associated with LCD in Northern European countries, with
99.7% and 100% nucleotide and deduced amino acid identity values, respectively.
LCDV genotype I has neither been reported in this species nor in the region.
Regardless of the source of infection, findings of this study add to existing
knowledge about the ecology of LCDV genotype I and its host range.
