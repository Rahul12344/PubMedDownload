More than a year after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19) is still a major global challenge for scientists to understand the
different dimensions of infection and find ways to prevent, treat, and develop a 
vaccine. On January 30, 2020, the world health organization (WHO) officially
announced this new virus as an international health emergency. While many
biological and mechanisms of pathogenicity of this virus are still unclear, it
seems that cytokine storm resulting from an immune response against the virus is 
considered the main culprit of the severity of the disease. Despite many global
efforts to control the SARS-CoV-2, several problems and challenges have been
posed in controlling the COVID-19 infection. These problems include the various
mutations, the emergence of variants with high transmissibility, the short period
of immunity against the virus, the possibility of reinfection in people improved,
lack of specific drugs, and problems in the development of highly sensitive and
specific vaccines. In this review, we summarized the results of the current trend
and the latest research studies on the characteristics of the structure and
genome of the SARS-CoV- 2, new mutations and variants of SARS-CoV-2,
pathogenicity, immune response, virus diagnostic tests, potential treatment, and 
vaccine candidate.
