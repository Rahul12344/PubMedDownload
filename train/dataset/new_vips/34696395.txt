BACKGROUND: The immunological changes associated with COVID-19 are largely
unknown.
METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 showing moderate (n = 18; SpO2 > 93%, respiratory
rate > 22 per minute, CRP > 10 mg/L) and severe (n = 23; SpO2 < 93%, respiratory 
rate >30 per minute, PaO2/FiO2 â‰¤ 300 mmHg, permanent oxygen therapy, qSOFA > 2)
infection, and 37 healthy donors (HD) were enrolled. Circulating T- and B-cell
subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: CD4+Th cells were skewed toward Th2-like phenotypes within CD45RA+CD62L-
(CM) and CD45RA-CD62L- (EM) cells in patients with severe COVID-19, while CM
CCR6+ Th17-like cells were decreased if compared with HD. Within CM Th17-like
cells "classical" Th17-like cells were increased and Th17.1-like cells were
decreased in severe COVID-19 cases. Circulating CM follicular Th-like (Tfh) cells
were decreased in all COVID-19 patients, and Tfh17-like cells represented the
most predominant subset in severe COVID-19 cases. Both groups of patients showed 
increased levels of IgD-CD38++ B cells, while the levels of IgD+CD38- and
IgD-CD38- were decreased. The frequency of IgD+CD27+ and IgD-CD27+ B cells was
significantly reduced in severe COVID-19 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed an imbalance within almost all circulating memory Th
subsets during acute COVID-19 and showed that altered Tfh polarization led to a
dysregulated humoral immune response.
