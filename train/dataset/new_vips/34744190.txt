Albeit, governments have instituted strong containment measures in the wake of
the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns of continuous local spread and economic impact of
the virus are impacting global food chains and food security. This paper
investigates the effect of concern about the i) local spread and ii) economic
impact of COVID-19, on the change in the amount of food and necessities bought in
twelve Sub-Sahara African countries. In addition, we examine if these effects are
channeled through food worries. The study uses a unique survey dataset by GeoPoll
collected in April 2020 (first round) and May 2020 (second round) and employs a
multinomial logit and generalized structural equation models. We find significant
effect of concern about COVID-19 on change in the package size of food and
necessities bought, which is heterogeneous across gender group and rural-urban
divide. Our results reveal that concerns of COVID-19 might be promoting
stockpiling behavior among females and those with no food worries (due to having 
sufficient money or resources). This if not properly managed could in the medium 
to long-term affect the food supply chain, food waste and exacerbate food worries
problem especially for already food deprived homes. We discuss the policy
implications.
