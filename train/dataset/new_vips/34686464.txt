PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a single
reconstruction kernel or both high and low frequency kernels should be used for
training deep learning models for the segmentation of diffuse lung disease on
chest computed tomography (CT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two annotated datasets of COVID-19 pneumonia (323,960
slices) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) (4,284 slices) were used. Annotated
CT images were used to train a U-Net architecture to segment disease. All CT
slices were reconstructed using both a lung kernel (LK) and a mediastinal kernel 
(MK). Three different trainings, resulting in three different models were
compared for each disease: training on LK only, MK only or LK+MK images. Dice
similarity scores (DSC) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: Models only trained on LK images performed better on LK images than on
MK images (median DSC = 0.62 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.54, 0.69] vs. 0.60
[IQR: 0.50, 0.70], P < 0.001 for COVID-19 and median DSC = 0.62 [IQR: 0.56, 0.69]
vs. 0.50 [IQR 0.43, 0.57], P < 0.001 for ILD). Similarly, models only trained on 
MK images performed better on MK images (median DSC = 0.62 [IQR: 0.53, 0.68] vs. 
0.54 [IQR: 0.47, 0.63], P < 0.001 for COVID-19 and 0.69 [IQR: 0.61, 0.73] vs.
0.63 [IQR: 0.53, 0.70], P < 0.001 for ILD). Models trained on both kernels
performed better or similarly than those trained on only one kernel. For
COVID-19, median DSC was 0.67 (IQR: =0.59, 0.73) when applied on LK images and
0.67 (IQR: 0.60, 0.74) when applied on MK images (P < 0.001 for both). For ILD,
median DSC was 0.69 (IQR: 0.63, 0.73) when applied on LK images (P = 0.006) and
0.68 (IQR: 0.62, 0.72) when applied on MK images (P > 0.99).
CONCLUSION: Reconstruction kernels impact the performance of deep learning-based 
models for lung disease segmentation. Training on both LK and MK images improves 
the performance.
