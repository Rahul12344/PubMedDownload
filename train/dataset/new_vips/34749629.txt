BACKGROUND: To classify chest computed tomography (CT) images as positive or
negative for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly and accurately,
researchers attempted to develop effective models by using medical images.
RESULTS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble model was developed for
classifying chest CT images as positive or negative for COVID-19. To classify
chest CT images acquired from COVID-19 patients, the proposed COVID19-CNN
ensemble model combines the use of multiple trained CNN models with a majority
voting strategy. The CNN models were trained to classify chest CT images by
transfer learning from well-known pre-trained CNN models and by applying their
algorithm hyperparameters as appropriate. The combination of algorithm
hyperparameters for a pre-trained CNN model was determined by uniform
experimental design. The chest CT images (405 from COVID-19 patients and 397 from
healthy patients) used for training and performance testing of the COVID19-CNN
ensemble model were obtained from an earlier study by Hu in 2020. Experiments
showed that, the COVID19-CNN ensemble model achieved 96.7% accuracy in
classifying CT images as COVID-19 positive or negative, which was superior to the
accuracies obtained by the individual trained CNN models. Other performance
measures (i.e., precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score) obtained bythe
COVID19-CNN ensemble model were higher than those obtained by individual trained 
CNN models.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19-CNN ensemble model had superior accuracy and excellent
capability in classifying chest CT images as COVID-19 positive or negative.
