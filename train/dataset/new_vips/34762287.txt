INTRODUCTION: Viral infections, especially with hepatotropic viruses, may trigger
autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs) and deteriorate their course. However,
association of previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (presence of anti-HBc
with or without anti-HBs or HBV DNA in serum) with AILDs is poorly studied so
far. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of previous hepatitis B
virus infection markers and its clinical significance in patients with autoimmune
liver diseases.
METHODS: The study was based on the data obtained from 234 consecutive
HBsAg-negative patients with AILDs [81 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), 122 with 
primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and 31 with primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC)] and 131 subjects of the control group without liver diseases. Blood
samples of the enrolled patients were tested for anti-HBc and HBV DNA. Samples of
liver tissue were examined by standard morphologic protocol and, in anti-HBc
positive subjects, for HBV DNA. We assessed estimated risks of AILDs according to
anti-HBc positivity and association of anti-HBc positivity with stage of liver
fibrosis.
RESULTS: Anti-HBc was detected in 14.5% participants in the control group vs
26.1% (p = 0.016) in patients with AILDs (including 27.1% subjects with PBC
(p = 0.021 vs control group), in 29% of PSC and 23.5% in AIH. HBV DNA was
detected in three patients with PBC and in one with AIH. Positive anti-HBc test
result was associated with higher risk of AILDs-odds ratio (OR) = 2.078 [95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.179-3.665], especially in PBC: OR (95% CI) 2.186
(1.165-4.101). Odds of advanced stage of liver fibrosis (F3-F4 by METAVIR) in
anti-HBc-positive subjects with PBC were also higher compared to those who had no
previous HBV infection: OR (95% CI) 2.614 (1.153-5.926).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant proportions of patients with AILDs are anti-HBc
positive, and some of them have OBI. Among patients with AILDs,
anti-HBc-positivity is most widespread in the PBC group and in subjects with
advanced stage of liver fibrosis. Our data may support the idea of an important
role of previous HBV infection in the etiology and pathogenesis of AILDs (namely 
PBC).
