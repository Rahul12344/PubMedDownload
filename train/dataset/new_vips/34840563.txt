Image medical semantic segmentation has been employed in various areas, including
medical imaging, computer vision, and intelligent transportation. In this study, 
the method of semantic segmenting images is split into two sections: the method
of the deep neural network and previous traditional method. The traditional
method and the published dataset for segmentation are reviewed in the first step.
The presented aspects, including all-convolution network, sampling methods, FCN
connector with CRF methods, extended convolutional neural network methods,
improvements in network structure, pyramid methods, multistage and multifeature
methods, supervised methods, semiregulatory methods, and nonregulatory methods,
are then thoroughly explored in current methods based on the deep neural network.
Finally, a general conclusion on the use of developed advances based on deep
neural network concepts in semantic segmentation is presented.
