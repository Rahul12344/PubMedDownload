The benefits of cooperative living for foraging, nesting, defence and buffering
environmental challenges lead animals with the most highly social lifestyles to
dominate many ecosystems. However, living in larger, more highly connected groups
should also increase the risks of pathogen exposure and transmission. While over 
long timescales selective responses could buffer the impacts of potential higher 
pathogen prevalence, similar processes are unlikely over short timescales. The
red fire ant Solenopsis invicta is ideal for measuring the effects of group size 
on pathogen prevalence because two types of society coexist in this species:
smaller single-nest single-queen colonies that are highly aggressive to their
neighbours and larger multiple-queen colonies that exchange resources with
neighbouring nests. We compare the presence of viruses between these two colony
types using metagenomic sequence classification of RNA-sequencing reads. We find 
that queens from multiple-queen colonies have 8.3-times higher viral load and
1.5-times higher viral diversity than queens from single-queen colonies. This
finding characterizes a rarely considered cost of transitions to more highly
social living. Furthermore, our results show that highly social invertebrates can
harbour many viruses.
