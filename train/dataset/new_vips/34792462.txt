For decades, there have been calls for innovative care solutions to address the
growing numbers of people living with complex health and social needs, including 
dementia. In 2020-2021, the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable
populations exposed many of the same issues and spurred renewed calls for
transformative change. As we look forward, it is imperative to consider options
not just for improving residential long-term care but also for integrating it
into broader continuums of health and social care, where people can receive
supports and services in the most appropriate setting. This commentary spotlights
campuses of care as one homegrown solution to address individuals' and system
needs and contexts.
