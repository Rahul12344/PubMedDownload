According to the "Istituto Superiore di Sanita'" (ISS), hospital infections are
the most frequent and serious complication of health care. This constitutes a
real health emergency which requires incisive and joint action at all levels of
the local and national health organization. Most of the valuable information
related to the presence of a specific microorganism in the blood are written into
the notes field of the laboratory exams results. The main objective of this work 
is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for the automatic
extraction of the names of microorganisms present in the clinical texts. A sample
of 499 microbiological notes have been analysed with the developed system and all
the microorganisms names have been extracted correctly, according to the labels
given by the expert.
