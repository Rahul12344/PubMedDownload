BACKGROUND: Advances in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing have enabled identification of new 
variants, tracking of its evolution, and monitoring of its spread. We aimed to
use whole genome sequencing to describe the molecular epidemiology of the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and to inform the implementation of effective public health
interventions for control in Zimbabwe.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nasopharyngeal samples collected
from nine laboratories in Zimbabwe between March 20 and Oct 16, 2020. Samples
were taken as a result of quarantine procedures for international arrivals or to 
test for infection in people who were symptomatic or close contacts of positive
cases. Samples that had a cycle threshold of less than 30 in the diagnostic PCR
test were processed for sequencing. We began our analysis in July, 2020 (120 days
since the first case), with a follow-up in October, 2020 (at 210 days since the
first case). The phylogenetic relationship of the genome sequences within
Zimbabwe and global samples was established using maximum likelihood and Bayesian
methods.
FINDINGS: Of 92 299 nasopharyngeal samples collected during the study period,
8099 were PCR-positive and 328 were available for sequencing, with 156 passing
sequence quality control. 83 (53%) of 156 were from female participants. At least
26 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Zimbabwe in the first 210 days
were associated with 12 global lineages. 151 (97%) of 156 had the Asp614Gly
mutation in the spike protein. Most cases, 93 (60%), were imported from outside
Zimbabwe. Community transmission was reported 6 days after the onset of the
outbreak.
INTERPRETATION: Initial public health interventions delayed onset of SARS-CoV-2
community transmission after the introduction of the virus from international and
regional migration in Zimbabwe. Global whole genome sequence data are essential
to reveal major routes of spread and guide intervention strategies.
