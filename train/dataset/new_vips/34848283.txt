The cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) causes severe economic losses in
cucurbit plants. Although it has been widely known in various countries for
several years, CCYV is rarely recognized due to the lack of rapid and effective
detection methods in the early stage of the disease. Recombinase polymerase
amplification (RPA) is a new, efficient, and simple technology for nucleic acid
detection. In the present study, reverse transcription (RT)-RPA and quantitative 
RT-RPA were developed and utilized for fast detection of CCYV in field-collected 
melon samples. The analysis was performed under constant temperature conditions
without the necessity for a thermal cycler in just 20 min. Moreover, the
detection limit of RT-RPA for CCYV was determined at 10 pg. In the study, 58
field-collected samples were employed to evaluate the performance of the two
assays. The positive rates were established at 72.4 % (42/58) and 75.9 % (44/58) 
by RT-RPA and qRT-RPA, respectively, and were consistent with the RT-PCR results.
The successful application of RPA for the detection of CCYV in field-collected
melon samples indicated its potential applicability. Thus, the developed RPA
assays provide an alternative for fast, efficient, sensitive, and reliable
detection of CCYV in diagnostic laboratories, which lack the precise
instrumentation, and fields without appropriate equipment.
