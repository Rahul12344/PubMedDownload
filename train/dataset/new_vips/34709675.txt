Quercetin, widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, is a flavonoid known for 
its antioxidant, antiviral, antimicrobial, and antiinflammatory properties.
Several studies highlight the potential use of quercetin as an antiviral, due to 
its ability to inhibit the initial stages of virus infection, to be able to
interact with proteases important for viral replication, and to reduce
inflammation caused by infection. Quercetin could also be useful in combination
with other drugs to potentially enhance the effects or synergistically interact
with them, in order to reduce their side effects and related toxicity. Since
there is no comprehensive compilation about antiviral activities of quercetin and
derivates, the aim of this review is providing a summary of their antiviral
activities on a set of human viral infections along with mechanisms of action.
Thus, the following family of viruses are examined: Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, 
Orthomyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Retroviridae, Picornaviridae,
Pneumoviridae, and Filoviridae.
