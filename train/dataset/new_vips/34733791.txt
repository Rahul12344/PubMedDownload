Background: Comparison of patterns of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
recurrence beyond the Milan criteria (HRBM) and identification of the independent
risk factors of time to recurrence beyond the Milan criteria (TRBM) after
resection or ablation can develop an optimal first-line treatment and provide
more opportunities and waiting time for salvage transplantation.
Methods: The patterns of HRBM after first-line resection or ablation in 384
patients with single-nodule HBV-associated HCC of 2-3 cm were retrospectively
analyzed by one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) between December 2008 and 
December 2017. The median TRBM between the resection group and the ablation group
was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves. The Cox regression analysis and binary
logistic regression were used for the identification of the independent risk
factors of TRBM and the occurrence of HRBM, respectively. The abilities of HRBM
and the recurrence to predict overall survival (OS) were compared by the
time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and estimated area under 
the curve.
Results: Of 384 patients enrolled in our study, 260 (67.7%) received resection
(resection group) and 124 (32.3%) underwent ablation (ablation group). The median
TRBM in the resection group was significantly longer than that in the ablation
group before PSM (median, not available vs. 101.4 months, P < 0.001) and after
PSM (median, not available vs. 85.7 months, P < 0.001). Cox regression showed
ablation, older age, CRP ≥1.81 mg/L, and PLT ≤80 × 109/L were the independent
risk factors of TRBM. Binary logistic regression also showed that ablation, CRP
≥1.81 mg/L, and PLT ≤80 × 109/L were the independent risk factors of the
occurrence of HRBM. The incidences of various phenotypes of HRBM were not
significantly different between the two groups, but the incidence of HRBM at the 
first recurrence in the ablation group was significantly higher than that in the 
resection group (P < 0.05). Besides, compared with recurrence, HRBM was a better 
predictor of OS (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: Compared with ablation, resection should be considered as a more
appropriate first-line option for patients with single-nodule HBV-associated HCC 
of 2-3 cm and a more promising bridge for liver transplantation in those
patients.
