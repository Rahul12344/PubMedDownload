Laboratory work is an essential part of natural science education because it
provides students with a valuable opportunity to experience practical scientific 
research firsthand. In laboratory work in pharmacology, students generally learn 
about biological mechanisms and drug action mechanisms by analyzing drug actions 
using laboratory animals. Actual experience with hands and eyes is an important
factor in the laboratory work. Under the COVID-19 epidemic, however, we were
forced to conduct the laboratory work online. For the laboratory work using
isolated organs, we used simulation software, in which students can examine
effects of a range of drugs on the smooth muscle within the guinea pig ileum. For
the behavioral observation practice, we showed the video of the experiments
conducted by the instructors beforehand to the students, and asked them to
observe and analyze the behavior. In this review, we will share our challenges to
online laboratory work.
