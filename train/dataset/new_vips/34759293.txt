The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected the
mental health of both infected and uninfected people. Although most psychiatric
disorders have highly overlapping genetic and pathogenic backgrounds, most
studies investigating the impact of the pandemic have examined only single
psychiatric disorders. It is necessary to examine longitudinal trajectories of
factors that modulate psychiatric states across multiple dimensions. About 2274
Japanese citizens participated in online surveys presented in December 2019
(before the pandemic), August 2020, Dec 2020, and April 2021. These surveys
included nine questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and
anxiety. Multidimensional psychiatric time-series data were then decomposed into 
four principal components. We used generalized linear models to identify
modulating factors for the effects of the pandemic on these components. The four 
principal components can be interpreted as a general psychiatric burden, social
withdrawal, alcohol-related problems, and depression/anxiety. Principal
components associated with general psychiatric burden and depression/anxiety
peaked during the initial phase of the pandemic. They were further exacerbated by
the economic burden the pandemic imposed. In contrast, principal components
associated with social withdrawal showed a delayed peak, with human relationships
as an important risk modulating factor. In addition, being female was a risk
factor shared across all components. Our results show that COVID-19 has imposed a
large and varied burden on the Japanese population since the commencement of the 
pandemic. Although components related to the general psychiatric burden remained 
elevated, peak intensities differed between components related to
depression/anxiety and those related to social withdrawal. These results
underline the importance of using flexible monitoring and mitigation strategies
for mental problems, according to the phase of the pandemic.
