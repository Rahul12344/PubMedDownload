Influenza is a major threat to millions of people worldwide. Entry inhibitors are
of particular interest for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
influenza. We have previously discovered oleanolic acid (OA) to be a mild
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) inhibitor. In this work, inspired by the 3D
structure of HA as a homotrimeric receptor, we designed and synthesized 15 OA
trimers with different linkers and central region via the copper-catalyzed
azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. All of the OA trimers were evaluated for
their antiviral activities in vitro, and 12c, 12e, 13c, and 13d were observed to 
exhibit robust potency (IC50 in the submicromolar range) against influenza
A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus that was stronger than that observed with oseltamivir. In
addition, these compounds also displayed strong biological activity against
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 and B/Sichuan/531/2018 (BV). The results of
hemagglutination inhibition assays and surface plasmon resonance binding assays
suggest that these OA trimers may interrupt the interaction between the HA
protein of influenza virus and the host cell sialic acid receptor, thus blocking 
viral entry. These findings highlight the utility of multivalent OA conjugates to
enhance the ligand-target interactions in anti-influenza virus drug design and
are also helpful for studying antiviral drugs derived from natural products.
