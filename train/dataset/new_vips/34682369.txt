The northern Italian region of Lombardy has been severely affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic since its arrival in Europe. However, there are only a few
published studies of the possible influence of social and cultural factors on its
prevalence in the general population. This cross-sectional study of the San Siro 
social-housing neighbourhood of Milan, which was carried about between 23
December 2020 and 19 February 2021, found that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid antibodies in the population as a whole was 12.4% (253/2044
inhabitants), but there was a more than two-fold difference between non-Italians 
and Italians (23.3% vs. 9.1%). Multivariable analyses showed that being more than
50 years old, living in crowded accommodation, being a non-Italian, and having a 
low educational level were associated with higher odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2
test, whereas a higher level of education, retirement, and being a former or
current cigarette smoker were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our
findings are in line with previous observations indicating that a lower
socio-economic status may be a risk factor for COVID-19 and show that
non-Italians are disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This
suggests that public health policies should focus more on disadvantaged
populations.
