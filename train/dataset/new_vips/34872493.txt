BACKGROUND: We investigated factors associated with prolonged viral clearance of 
SARS-CoV-2 among non-severe adult patients in Osaka, Japan. A total of 706
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this longitudinal
observational study between 29 January 2020 and 31 May 2020, across 62 hospitals 
and three non-hospital recuperation facilities.
METHODS: Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the factors
associated with prolonged (29 days: upper 25% in duration) viral clearance of
SARS-CoV-2. Linear regression analysis was conducted to assess these factors
14 days after symptom onset.
RESULTS: The median duration of viral clearance was 22 days from symptom onset.
After adjustment for sex, age, symptoms, comorbidity, and location of
recuperation, comorbidities were associated with prolonged duration: (OR, 1.77
[95% CI, 1.11-2.82]) for one, (OR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.32-4.61]) for two or more
comorbidities. Viral clearance 14 days after symptom onset was 3 days longer for 
one comorbidity and 4 days longer for two or more comorbidities compared to
clearance when there was no comorbidity.
CONCLUSION: The presence of comorbidity was a robust factor associated with a
longer duration of viral clearance, extending by 3 to 4 days compared to patients
with no comorbidity.
