Objective: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem in the
world. Barbers deal with frequent abrasions/lacerations due to sharp equipment,
making them a high-risk group. Determination of HBsAg positive status excludes
most reservoirs of transmission in the population. However, Occult Hepatitis B
continues to be a source of transmission. The aim of this study was to study the 
prevalence of occult HBV infection in barbers serving the armed forces clientele 
and evaluate their knowledge and preventive practices against HBV transmission.
Methods: Seventy-nine HBsAg negative barbers were included in this study and
interviewed for the status of immunisation and preventive practices. Anti-HBc
total and HBV DNA levels were measured along with a complete haemogram, LFT, PT
INR, ultrasound abdomen and Fibroscan of the liver.
Results: The prevalence of occult Hepatitis B status was 3.79%. Among barbers who
were anti-HBc total positive, 100% were found to have replicative HBV DNA status.
All barbers (100%) were unaware of the existence and modes of HBV
transmission and were never screened for HBV; 98.73% of barbers followed improper
disinfection practices and were never immunised.
Conclusion: The prevalence of occult HBV infection in barbers, absence of
immunisation, unawareness and improper disinfection practices are significantly
at risk for transmission to the unaware clients. It is important to educate
barbers, establish a universal disinfection procedure and implement a system of
compulsory Hepatitis B vaccination before the commencement of their trade work.
