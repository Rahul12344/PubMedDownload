Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is characterized by the detection of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) DNA in serum or liver but negativity for hepatitis B surface
antigen. OBI, which is thought to be maintained by host, immunological, viral
and/or epigenetic factors, is one of the most challenging clinical features in
the study of viral hepatitis. Currently, there is no validated detection test for
OBI. It is believed that OBI is widely distributed throughout the world, with a
higher prevalence in populations at high-risk HBV, but the detailed worldwide
prevalence patterns are unknown. We conducted a survey of recently published
studies on OBI rates across all continents. High prevalence rates of OBI are
observed in some specific groups, including patients with hepatitis C virus,
human immunodeficiency virus co-infection or hepatocellular carcinoma. In 2016,
the World Health Organization adopted strategies to eliminate viral hepatitis by 
2030, but the difficulties in detecting and treating OBI currently challenge this
goal. Subjects with OBI can transmit HBV, and episodes of reactivation can occur.
Further studies to understanding the mechanisms that drive the development of OBI
are needed and can contribute to efforts at eliminating viral hepatitis.
