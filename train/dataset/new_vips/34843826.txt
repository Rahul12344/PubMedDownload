Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by standard screening measures can reduce the chance of
COVID-19 spread before the symptoms become severe. Detecting viral RNA and
antigens, anti-viral antibodies, and CT-scan are the most routine diagnostic
methods. Accordingly, several diagnostic platforms including thermal and
isothermal amplifications, CRISPR/Cas‑based approaches, digital PCR, ELISA, NGS, 
and point-of-care testing methods with variable sensitivities, have been
developed that may facilitate managing and preventing the further spread of the
infection. Here, we summarized the currently available direct and indirect
testing platforms in research and clinical settings, including recent progress in
the methods to detect viral RNA, antigens, and specific antibodies. This summary 
may help in selecting the effective method for a special application sucha as
routine laboratory diagnosis, point-of-care tests or tracing the the virus spread
and mutations.
