Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly discovered
enteric coronavirus. We have previously shown that the caspase-dependent
FASL-mediated and mitochondrion-mediated apoptotic pathways play a central role
in SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis, which facilitates viral replication. However, the 
roles of intracellular signaling pathways in SADS-CoV-mediated cell apoptosis and
the relative advantages that such pathways confer on the host or virus remain
largely unknown. In this study, we show that SADS-CoV induces the activation of
ERK during infection, irrespective of viral biosynthesis. The knockdown or
chemical inhibition of ERK1/2 significantly suppressed viral protein expression
and viral progeny production. The inhibition of ERK activation also circumvented 
SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that ERK
activation is important for SADS-CoV replication, and contributes to the
virus-mediated changes in host cells. Our findings demonstrate the takeover of a 
particular host signaling mechanism by SADS-CoV and identify a potential approach
to inhibiting viral spread.
