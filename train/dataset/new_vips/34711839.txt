Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins belonging to the family of 
pattern-recognition receptors. They function as sensors of invading pathogens
through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. After their
engagement by microbial ligands, TLRs trigger downstream signaling pathways that 
culminate into transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in immune defense. 
Here we provide an updated overview on members of the TLR family and we focus on 
their role in antiviral response. Understanding of innate sensing and signaling
of viruses triggered by these receptors would provide useful knowledge to prompt 
the development of vaccines able to elicit effective and long-lasting immune
responses. We describe the mechanisms developed by viral pathogens to escape from
immune surveillance mediated by TLRs and finally discuss how TLR/virus interplay 
might be exploited to guide the design of innovative vaccine platforms.
