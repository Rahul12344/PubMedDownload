Here, a novel microfluidic test kit combining ultrahigh throughput hydrodynamic
filtration and sandwich immunoassay is reported. Specifically, nano and
microbeads coated with two different, noncompetitive antibodies, are used to
capture the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
nucleocapsid (N) proteins simultaneously, forming larger complexes. Microfluidic 
filtration discards free nanobeads but retains antigen-bridged complexes in the
observation zone, where a display of red color indicates the presence of antigen 
in the sample. This testing platform exhibits high throughput separation (<30 s) 
and enrichment of antigen that exceeds the traditional lateral flow assays or
microfluidic assays, with a low limit of detection (LoD) < 100 copies mL-1 . In
two rounds of clinical trials conducted in December 2020 and August 2021, the
assays demonstrate high sensitivities of 95.4% and 100%, respectively, which
proves this microfluidic test kit is capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus
variants evolved over significant periods of time. Furthermore, the mass-produced
chip can be fabricated at a cost of $0.98/test and the robust design allows the
chip to be reused for over 50 times. All of these features make the microfluidic 
test kit particularly suitable for areas with inadequate medical infrastructure
and a shortage of laboratory resources.
