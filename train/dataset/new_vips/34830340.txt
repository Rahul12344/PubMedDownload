Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects the majority of the human population and
can induce encephalitis, which is the most common cause of sporadic, fatal
encephalitis. An increase of microglia is detected in the brains of encephalitis 
patients. The issues regarding whether and how microglia protect the host and
neurons from HSV-1 infection remain elusive. Using a murine infection model, we
showed that HSV-1 infection on corneas increased the number of microglia to
outnumber those of infiltrating leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and T
cells) and enhanced microglia activation in brains. HSV-1 antigens were detected 
in brain neurons, which were surrounded by microglia. Microglia depletion
increased HSV-1 lethality of mice with elevated brain levels of viral loads,
infected neurons, neuron loss, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, neutrophils, interferon 
(IFN)-β, and IFN-γ. In vitro studies demonstrated that microglia from infected
mice reduced virus infectivity. Moreover, microglia induced IFN-β and the
signaling pathway of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 to
inhibit viral replication and damage of neurons. Our study reveals how microglia 
protect the host and neurons from HSV-1 infection.
