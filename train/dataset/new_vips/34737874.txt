We propose a hybrid partial differential equation-agent-based (PDE-ABM) model to 
describe the spatio-temporal viral dynamics in a cell population. The virus
concentration is considered as a continuous variable and virus movement is
modelled by diffusion, while changes in the states of cells (i.e. healthy,
infected, dead) are represented by a stochastic ABM. The two subsystems are
intertwined: the probability of an agent getting infected in the ABM depends on
the local viral concentration, and the source term of viral production in the PDE
is determined by the cells that are infected. We develop a computational tool
that allows us to study the hybrid system and the generated spatial patterns in
detail. We systematically compare the outputs with a classical ODE system of
viral dynamics, and find that the ODE model is a good approximation only if the
diffusion coefficient is large. We demonstrate that the model is able to predict 
SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, and replicate the output of in vitro experiments. 
Applying the model to influenza as well, we can gain insight into why the
outcomes of these two infections are different.
