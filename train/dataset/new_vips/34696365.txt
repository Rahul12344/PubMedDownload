Nascent HIV-1 particles incorporate the viral envelope glycoprotein and multiple 
host transmembrane proteins during assembly at the plasma membrane. At least some
of these host transmembrane proteins on the surface of virions are reported as
pro-viral factors that enhance virus attachment to target cells or facilitate
trans-infection of CD4+ T cells via interactions with non-T cells. In addition to
the pro-viral factors, anti-viral transmembrane proteins are incorporated into
progeny virions. These virion-incorporated transmembrane proteins inhibit HIV-1
entry at the point of attachment and fusion. In infected polarized CD4+ T cells, 
HIV-1 Gag localizes to a rear-end protrusion known as the uropod. Regardless of
cell polarization, Gag colocalizes with and promotes the virion incorporation of 
a subset of uropod-directed host transmembrane proteins, including CD162, CD43,
and CD44. Until recently, the functions of these virion-incorporated proteins had
not been clear. Here, we review the recent findings about the roles played by
virion-incorporated CD162, CD43, and CD44 in HIV-1 spread to CD4+ T cells.
