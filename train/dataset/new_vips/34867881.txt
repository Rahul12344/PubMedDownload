A dsRNA segment was identified in the fungus Melanconiella theae isolated from
tea plants. The complete dsRNA sequence, determined by random cloning together
with RACE protocol, is 2,461 bp in length with an AU-rich content (62.37%) and
comprises a single ORF of 2,265-nucleotides encoding an RNA-dependent
RNA-polymerase (RdRp, 754 amino acids in size). The terminus sequences can fold
into predicted stable stem-loop structures. A BLASTX and phylogenetic analysis
revealed the dsRNA genome shows similarities with the RdRp sequences of
mitoviruses, with the highest identity of 48% with those of grapevine-associated 
mitovirus 20 and Colletotrichum fructicola mitovirus 1. Our results reveal a
novel member, tentatively named Melanconiella theae mitovirus 1 (MtMV1), belongs 
to the family Mitoviridae. MtMV1 is capsidless as examined by transmission
electron microscope, efficiently transmitted through conidia as 100
conidium-generated colonies were analyzed, and easily eliminated by hyphal
tipping method combined with green-leaf tea powder. MtMV1 has a genomic sequence 
obviously divergent from those of most members in the family Mitoviridae and some
unique characteristics unreported in known members. This is the first report of a
mycovirus infecting Melanconiella fungi to date.
