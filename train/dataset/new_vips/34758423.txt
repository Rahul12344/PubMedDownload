The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by successiveoutbreaks effecting
large swathes of the world's populations. These waves of infection have been
mainly driven by a number of more transmissiblevariants which appear to evade the
populations' immunity gained from previous outbreaks. There appears to be a link 
between COVID-19 and a ubiquitous airborne pollutant calledparticulate matter,
PM2.5. Particulate matter through a number of mechanisms, including its
anthropogenic effect, appears to be associated with the incidence and the
mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper poses a number of
hypotheses on the short to medium-term mechanisms whereby PM2.5 may be party to
the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 virus, with the consequent emergence of
variants.
