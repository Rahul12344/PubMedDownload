BACKGROUND: Nutritional factors are essential for the functioning of the immune
system and could therefore play a role in COVID-19 but evidence is needed. Our
objective was to study the associations between diet and the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection in a large population-based sample.
METHODS: Our analyses were conducted in the French prospective NutriNet-Santé
cohort study (2009-2020). Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was
assessed by ELISA on dried blood spots. Dietary intakes were derived from
repeated 24 h dietary records (at least 6) in the two years preceding the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic in France (February 2020). Multi-adjusted logistic
regression models were computed.
RESULTS: A total of 7766 adults (70.3% women, mean age: 60.3 years) were
included, among which 311 were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Dietary
intakes of vitamin C (OR for 1 SD=0.86 (0.75-0.98), P=0.02), vitamin B9 (OR=0.84 
(0.72-0.98), P=0.02), vitamin K (OR=0.86 (0.74-0.99), P=0.04), fibers (OR=0.84
(0.72-0.98), P=0.02), and fruit and vegetables (OR=0.85 (0.74-0.97), P=0.02) were
associated to a decreased probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection while dietary
intakes of calcium (OR=1.16 (1.01-1.35), P=0.04) and dairy products (OR=1.19
(1.06-1.33), P=0.002) associated to increased odds. No association was detected
with other food groups or nutrients or with the overall diet quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher dietary intakes of fruit and vegetables and, consistently, of
vitamin C, folate, vitamin K and fibers were associated with a lower
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond its established role in the
prevention of non-communicable diseases, diet could therefore also contribute to 
prevent some infectious diseases such as COVID-19.
