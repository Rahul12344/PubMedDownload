BackgroundMany countries implemented national lockdowns to contain the rapid
spread of SARS-CoV-2 and avoid overburdening healthcare capacity.AimWe aimed to
quantify how the French lockdown impacted population mixing, contact patterns and
behaviours.MethodsWe conducted an online survey using convenience sampling and
collected information from participants aged 18 years and older between 10 April 
and 28 April 2020.ResultAmong the 42,036 survey participants, 72% normally worked
outside their home, and of these, 68% changed to telework during lockdown and 17%
reported being unemployed during lockdown. A decrease in public transport use was
reported from 37% to 2%. Participants reported increased frequency of hand
washing and changes in greeting behaviour. Wearing masks in public was generally 
limited. A total of 138,934 contacts were reported, with an average of 3.3
contacts per individual per day; 1.7 in the participants aged 65 years and older 
compared with 3.6 for younger age groups. This represented a 70% reduction
compared with previous surveys, consistent with SARS-CoV2 transmission reduction 
measured during the lockdown. For those who maintained a professional activity
outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%.ConclusionThe
lockdown affected the population's behaviour, work, risk perception and contact
patterns. The frequency and heterogeneity of contacts, both of which are critical
factors in determining how viruses spread, were affected. Such surveys are
essential to evaluate the impact of lockdowns more accurately and anticipate
epidemic dynamics in these conditions.
