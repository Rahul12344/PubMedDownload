BACKGROUND: Global pandemics like Zika (ZIKV) factor into pregnancy planning and 
avoidance, yet little is known about how primary care providers (PCPs)
incorporate public health guidance into contraceptive counseling. Study
objectives include: 1) determining the impact of the ZIKV pandemic on
contraceptive counseling changes; and 2) assessing PCP knowledge and practice
regarding contraception, ZIKV, and CDC ZIKV guidelines.
METHODS: Study components included: (1) a retrospective review of electronic
health records of non-pregnant, reproductive age women presenting for preventive 
health visits between 2014 and 2017 assessed using interrupted time series
analyses (ITSA) to identify changes in documentation of ZIKV risk assessment and 
contraceptive counseling; and (2) a sequential, cross-sectional study with
quantitative surveys and qualitative, semi-structured interviews of PCPs
providing preventive care to non-pregnant patients at eight federally qualified
health centers in Utah. We performed descriptive analyses on survey data and
analyzed qualitative data for dominant themes using a modified Health Belief
Model.
RESULTS: We conducted 6634 chart reviews yielding 9840 visits. The ITSA did not
reveal changes in ZIKV risk assessment or contraceptive counseling. Twenty-two
out of 40 (55%) eligible providers participated in the provider component.
Participants averaged 69 and 81% correct on contraceptive and ZIKV knowledge
questions, respectively. Sixty-five percent reported counseling consistent with
CDC ZIKV guidelines. Qualitative analysis found providers unlikely to prioritize 
ZIKV risk assessment in contraceptive counseling for non-pregnant patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PCPs who care for non-pregnant women are knowledgeable about
contraception and ZIKV; however, there was no change in ZIKV risk assessment or
contraceptive counseling. This stresses the importance of developing strategies
to improve guideline uptake.
