BACKGROUND: Thoracic actinomycosis is an uncommon, chronic, and progressive
infection, especially in patients with HIV. We report a case of thoracic
actinomycosis presenting as an isolated pleural effusion in a patient with an HIV
infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old patient with progressive dyspnea and fever was
admitted. On the right side, an ipsilateral massive pleural effusion was
confirmed on the chest radiograph, and an HIV infection was newly diagnosed. A
pleural biopsy was performed for the further differential diagnosis of potential 
opportunistic infections and malignancies. The pathology findings were consistent
with actinomycosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Active diagnostic approaches such as a pleural biopsy should be
considered for indeterminate pleural effusions in immunocompromised patients.
