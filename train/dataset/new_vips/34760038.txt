OBJECTIVE: Due to a continued increase in viral pneumonia incidence and resulting
high mortality, fast and accurate diagnosis is important for effective
management. This investigation examined the significance of blood biomarkers and 
the CT score in the early diagnosis of viral pneumonia.
METHODS: Patients who were hospitalized due to radiologically-confirmed pneumonia
and underwent virus antigen rapid test were enrolled. Their clinical information 
was compared. Blood mononuclear cell count, LDH, and plasma D-dimer were
obtained. To evaluate the utility of biomarker levels in differentiating viral
pneumonia from other pneumonia, ROC curves were developed to analyze the AUC. The
optimal cut-off thresholds, specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values were 
assessed using the Youden index. The added value of the multi-marker approach was
delineated using IDI and Reclassification analyses using NRI; IDI and NRI values 
were examined with 95% CI.
RESULTS: Overall, 1163 inpatients were recruited between January 2017 and January
2021. They were sub-divided into the viral pneumonia (n = 563) and non-viral
pneumonia (n = 600) categories. We found that the CT score, blood mononuclear
cell count, LDH, and plasma D-dimer were markedly elevated in viral pneumonia
patients. At an LDH threshold of 693.595 U/L, an AUC of ROC was 0.805 in
differentiating viral pneumonia. The combination of CT score and blood biomarkers
had an ROC AUC value of 0.908.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining elevated biomarkers with CT assessments outperformed the
CT score alone in identifying viral pneumonia. It is crucial to better
characterize the significance of biomarkers in combination with CT assessments in
the diagnosis of viral pneumonia.
