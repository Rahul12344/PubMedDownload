The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how a stochastic disruptive event can
dramatically alter community soundscapes. Whilst religious bells have symbolism
in many worldwide faiths, the sound emanating from church bells can be considered
public domain and therefore, is not exclusive to the church. Pandemic-related
interruption of these sounds impacts not only the church involved, but both the
surrounding soundscape and any members of the community who ascribe value to
these sounds. This paper examines the soundscape of Christian churches in the
states of New South Wales and Victoria, to give an Australian perspective one
year after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. It provides an
update of the situation in Australia, building on our previous work from August
of that year. In doing so, it explores the activity of church tower bell ringing,
and how this "non-essential" activity has been affected, both during and
subsequent to the heavy community restrictions applied in Australia. The paper
also explores what lengths bellringers have undertaken to be permitted to conduct
such activities, such as the use of adaptive measures due to "social distancing",
and considers what implications this enforced silence has in similar soundscapes 
elsewhere in the world.
