INTRODUCTION: In light of increased rates of hospitalizations among adolescents
diagnosed with severe symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of
electronic vaping product (EVP) use among this population, this review highlights
the public health and clinical implications of EVP use during an ongoing
respiratory disease pandemic.
OBJECTIVES: This review assesses evidence of pulmonary effects of EVP use from
pathophysiological and epidemiological research and explores EVP use as a risk
factor for COVID-19.
METHODS: An updated, yet concise, literature review of recent scientific evidence
examining trends of EVP use among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic was
conducted. Included in this review are studies examining the pulmonary effects of
EVP use and scope of the problem relating to its use among adolescents within the
context of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical and theoretical models establish pulmonary harm
associated with EVPs. Based on the limited epidemiological studies, the
contribution of EVP use to the risk of contracting COVID-19 is mixed.
EVP-associated lung injury could present as a diagnostic challenge for clinicians
during COVID-19 and requires greater attention. Clinicians should effectively
screen for and discourage EVP use among adolescents.
