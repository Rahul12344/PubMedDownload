Objectives: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with a better
response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. We hypothesised that genetic alterations
induced by EBV infection are responsible for the activation of key immune
responses and hence are predictive of anti-PD1 efficacy.
Methods: With transcriptome data of gastric cancer (GC), we explored
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific for EBV infection and performed
coexpression network analysis using the DEGs to identify the consistent
coexpression genes (CCGs) between EBV-positive and EBV-negative GC tissues. We
selected the tag genes of the CCGs and validated them using RNA sequencing and
immunohistochemistry. We established murine models and collected tissues from
clinical patients to test the value of SLAMF8 in predicting anti-PD1 treatment.
The location and expression of SLAMF8 were characterised by multiplex
immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR. Moreover, exogenous overexpression and
RNA-sequencing analysis were used to test the potential function of SLAMF8.
Results: We identified 290 CCGs and validated the tag gene SLAMF8 in
transcriptome data of gastrointestinal cancer (GI). We observed that the T-cell
activation pathway was significantly enriched in high-expression SLAMF8 GI
cancers. Higher SLAMF8 expression was positively associated with CD8 expression
and a better response to anti-PD1 treatment. We further observed dynamically
increased expression of SLAMF8 in murine models relatively sensitive to anti-PD1 
treatment. SLAMF8 was mainly expressed on the surface of macrophages. Exogenous
overexpression of SLAMF8 in macrophages resulted in enrichment of positive
regulation of multiple immune-related pathways.
Conclusion: Higher SLAMF8 expression may predict better anti-PD1 immunotherapy
efficacy in GI cancer.
