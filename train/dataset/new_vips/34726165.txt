Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped RNA virus. One of the hallmarks of HCV
infection is a rearrangement of the host cell membranes, known as the `membranous
web'. Full-field cryo soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) in the water-window energy
range (284-543 eV) was performed on the MISTRAL beamline to investigate, in whole
unstained cells, the morphology of the membranous rearrangements induced in HCV
replicon-harbouring cells in conditions close to the living physiological state. 
All morphological alterations could be reverted by a combination of
sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, which are clinically approved antivirals (direct-acting
antivirals; DAAs) for HCV infection. Correlatively combining cryo-SXT and 2D
synchrotron-based infrared microscopy provides critical information on the
chemical nature of specific infection-related structures, which allows specific
patterns of the infection process or the DAA-mediated healing process to be
distinguished.
