BACKGROUND: Outside activities have decreased due to the spread of the COVID-19
since 2019; therefore, the need for education using information and communication
technology (ICT) for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has
increased. This study systematically evaluated the effects of cognitive
enhancement interventions using ICT on older adults with MCI.
METHODS: Six electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, PubMed,
RISS, and KISS) were searched for relevant articles published from 25 January to 
10 February, 2021.
RESULTS: As a result of the systematic literature review, 12 research papers were
finally selected as the literature for quality evaluation, and 11 final papers
were selected, excluding one in the quality evaluation. From the synthesis in
this study, it was found that cognitive intervention using ICT showed a
statistically significant positive effect on cognitive function when compared
with various control groups (SMD = 0.4547; p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.1980-0.7113).
CONCLUSIONS: Through this study, cognitive intervention using ICT showed a small 
effect size for older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and statistically
significant results were found.
