Varicella vaccine meningitis is an uncommon delayed adverse event of vaccination.
Varicella vaccine meningitis has been diagnosed in 12 children, of whom 3 were
immunocompromised. We now report two additional cases of vaccine meningitis in
twice-immunized immunocompetent children and we perform further testing on a
prior third case. We used three methods to diagnose or investigate cases of
varicella vaccine meningitis, none of which have been used previously on this
disease. These include metagenomic next-generation sequencing and cytokine
multiplex profiling of cerebrospinal fluid and immunology exome analysis of white
blood cells. In one new case, the diagnosis was confirmed by metagenomic
next-generation sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid. Both varicella vaccine virus
and human herpesvirus 7 DNA were detected. We performed cytokine multiplex
profiling on the cerebrospinal fluid of two cases and found ten elevated
biomarkers: interferon gamma, interleukins IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17F,
chemokines CXCL-9, CXCL-10, CCL-2, and G-CSF. In a second new case, we performed 
immunology exome sequencing on a panel of 356 genes, but no errors were found.
After a review of all 14 cases, we concluded that (i) there is no common
explanation for this adverse event, but (ii) ingestion of an oral corticosteroid 
burst 3-4 weeks before onset of vaccine meningitis may be a risk factor in some
cases.
