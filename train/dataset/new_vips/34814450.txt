Objective: To explore the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection,
influence factors and interaction on HCV infection in patients receiving
methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in Taiyuan. Methods: Between April-June
2019, three MMT clinics in Taiyuan were selected to conduct a face-to-face
questionnaire survey among MMT patients to collect the information about their
socio-demographic characteristics, drug use, MMT, sexual behavior and health
status. Software EpiData 3.1 was used for real-time double entry to establish the
database. Software SAS 9.4 was used to analyze the data, and χ2 test was used for
univariate analysis and logistic regression model was used for multivariate and
interaction analyses. Results: A total of 903 subjects were surveyed among MMT
patients, the male to female ratio of was 7.21∶1(743∶103), and the rate of HCV
infection was 12.53% (106/846). After adjusting for the confounding factors,
being women (OR=1.936, 95%CI: 1.023-3.662), having sex with drug users (OR=2.073,
95%CI: 1.110-3.871) and injection drug use (OR=7.737, 95%CI: 4.614-12.973) might 
be the risk factors for HCV infection in patients receiving MMT. The results
showed that there were multiplicative interactions among women, having sex with
drug user and injection drug use on HCV infection. Conclusions: Being women,
having sex with drug user and injection drug use were associated with higher risk
for HCV infection in patients receiving MMT in Taiyuan. There were multiplication
interactions between being women and having sex with drug user, being female and 
injection drug use, and having sex with drug use and injection drug use on HCV
infection.

Publisher: 目的： 分析太原市美沙酮维持治疗（MMT）患者HCV感染状况及其感染相关因素与交互作用。 方法：
2019年4-6月对太原市3所MMT门诊正在接受治疗的MMT患者，采用面对面问卷调查收集其一般人口学特征、吸毒情况、MMT情况、性行为、健康状况等，通过病历资料查
阅MMT患者HCV检测结果，使用EpiData 3.1软件双录入数据，使用SAS
9.4软件进行统计学分析，用χ2检验进行HCV感染的单因素分析、logistic回归模型进行多因素和交互作用分析。 结果：
MMT患者846例中，男女性别比7.21∶1（743∶103），HCV感染率为12.53%（106/846）。控制混杂因素后，女性（OR=1.936，95%CI：
1.023~3.662）、性伴有吸毒史（OR=2.073，95%CI：1.110~3.871）和注射吸毒者（OR=7.737，95%CI：4.614~12.973
）的感染HCV风险较高。交互作用结果显示，女性、性伴有吸毒史者及注射吸毒者之间存在相乘交互作用。 结论：
太原市MMT患者中，女性、性伴有吸毒史者、注射吸毒者HCV感染的风险较高，女性与性伴有吸毒史者、女性与注射吸毒者、性伴有吸毒史者与注射吸毒者对HCV感染的发生存在
相乘交互作用。.
