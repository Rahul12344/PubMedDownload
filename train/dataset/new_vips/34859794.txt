In this study, an electrochemical approach for the determination of coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) was developed. The biosensor system relied on the spike
protein (S-protein) based infection mechanism of the virus and included separate 
interactions of receptors like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD147. 
After the optimization of experimental parameters, the analytical characteristics
of both receptors ACE2 and CD147 were investigated. For ACE2 receptor, the linear
detection ranges of the S-protein were found in the range of 700 ng mL-1 to 1500 
ng mL-1 and from 1500 ng mL-1 to 7000 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD)
value of 299.30 ng mL-1. Meanwhile, for CD147 receptor the linear range was in
the range of 500 ng mL-1 to 5000 ng mL-1 with a LOD value of 38.99 ng mL-1. After
the examination of analytical characteristics, the developed electrochemical
approach was applied for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 samples 
and the obtained results were validated with real time polymerase chain reaction 
method.
