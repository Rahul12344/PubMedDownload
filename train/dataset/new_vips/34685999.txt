Grapevine (Vitis spp.) is one of the most economically important temperate fruit 
crops. Grapevine breeding programs require access to high-quality Vitis cultivars
and wild species, which may be maintained within genebanks. Shoot tip
cryopreservation is a valuable technique for the safe, long-term conservation of 
Vitis genetic resources that complements traditional field and in vitro germplasm
collections. Vitis is highly susceptible to virus infections. Virus-free plants
are required as propagation material for clonally propagated germplasm, and also 
for the global exchange of grapevine genetic resources. Shoot tip cryotherapy, a 
method based on cryopreservation, has proven to be effective in eradicating
viruses from infected plants, including grapevine. This comprehensive review
outlines/documents the advances in Vitis shoot tip cryopreservation and
cryotherapy that have resulted in healthy plants with high regrowth levels across
diverse Vitis species.
