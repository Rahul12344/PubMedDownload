OBJECTIVES: Assessment of whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has been propagated during intestinal passage and infectivity is
conserved when shed rectally by hospitalized individuals.
METHODS: An exploratory cohort study including 28 inpatients with coronavirus
disease 2019 with estimation of RNA levels by RT-PCR and of viral infectivity by 
culturing of viral material sampled concomitantly and identically from pharynx
and rectum.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected more frequently (91%, 30/33 versus 42%,
14/33, p <0.0001) and at higher concentrations (median levels 2 190 186 IU/mL
versus 13 014 IU/mL, p <0.0001) in the pharyngeal swabs than in the rectal swabs.
For all sample pairs (n = 33) the rectal swabs contained undetectable or lower
SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations than their paired pharyngeal swabs. Replicative
virus was found in 37% (11/30) of the PCR-positive pharyngeal swabs, whereas none
of the PCR-positive rectal swabs could be cultured (0%, 0/14) despite containing 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations up to 1 544 691 IU/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data draw into question whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted
readily from faeces.
