The current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known as Covid-19
(coronavirus disease 2019). This disease can be asymptomatic or can affect
multiple organ systems. Damage induced by the virus is related to dysfunctional
activity of the immune system, but the activity of molecules such as C-reactive
protein (CRP) as a factor capable of inducing an inflammatory status that may be 
involved in the severe evolution of the disease, has not been extensively
evaluated. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI-PubMed database to
find articles related to Covid-19 immunity, inflammatory response, and CRP
published from December 2019 to December 2020. High levels of CRP were found in
patients with severe evolution of Covid-19 in which several organ systems were
affected and in patients who died. CRP activates complement, induces the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces apoptosis which, together
with the inflammatory status during the disease, can lead to a severe outcome.
Several drugs can decrease the level or block the effect of CRP and might be
useful in the treatment of Covid-19. From this review it is reasonable to
conclude that CRP is a factor that can contribute to severe evolution of Covid-19
and that the use of drugs able to lower CRP levels or block its activity should
be evaluated in randomized controlled clinical trials.
