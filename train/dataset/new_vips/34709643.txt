A growing body of evidence demonstrates that endothelial cells (ECs) play a
prominent role in immune-enhanced pathology seen in dengue virus (DENV) infection
that might contribute to vascular permeability and hemorrhagic manifestations in 
severe dengue cases. However, it remains a question of whether DENV infection of 
ECs directly causes permeability or if extra-endothelial factors such as immune
cell activation or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) are required. In this
chapter, we detail the measurement of the transendothelial electrical resistance 
(TEER), a quantitative technique to measure the integrity of tight junction
dynamics in cell culture models of endothelial monolayers and show that DENV
infection of ECs does not cause endothelial permeability in vitro.
