The objective of this review is to describe the evolution of lung tissue-derived 
diploid progenitor cell applications, ranging from historical biotechnological
substrate functions for vaccine production and testing to current investigations 
around potential therapeutic use in respiratory tract regenerative medicine. Such
cell types (e.g., MRC-5 or WI-38 sources) were extensively studied since the
1960s and have been continuously used over five decades as safe and sustainable
industrial vaccine substrates. Recent research and development efforts around
diploid progenitor lung cells (e.g., FE002-Lu or Walvax-2 sources) consist in
qualification for potential use as optimal and renewed vaccine production
substrates and, alternatively, for potential therapeutic applications in
respiratory tract regenerative medicine. Potentially effective, safe, and
sustainable cell therapy approaches for the management of inflammatory lung
diseases or affections and related symptoms (e.g., COVID-19 patients and burn
patient severe inhalation syndrome) using local homologous allogeneic cell-based 
or cell-derived product administrations are considered. Overall, lung
tissue-derived progenitor cells isolated and produced under good manufacturing
practices (GMP) may be used with high versatility. They can either act as key
industrial platforms optimally conforming to specific pharmacopoeial requirements
or as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for potentially effective promotion
of lung tissue repair or regeneration.
