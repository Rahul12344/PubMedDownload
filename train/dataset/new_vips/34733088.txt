Background: Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
have become a standard treatment for both HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infections. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been associated with kidney
injury and possible long-term damage in patients with HIV. Few studies have
examined whether this holds true for patients treated for HBV.
Methods: Data were gathered from the Veterans Health Administration Corporate
Data Warehouse between July 1, 2005 and July 31, 2015. Patients aged ≥ 18 years
with HBV infection and prescribed a NRTI for > 1 month were included in the study
and followed for 36 months. Patients with HIV infection were excluded, and
patients treated with combination TDF/emtricitabine were analyzed separately from
patients receiving only TDF. A linear mixed model was used to examine the effects
of time and specific agent on renal function, which was measured with estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at various time intervals.
Results: There were 413 incidences of NRTI use in 308 subjects during the 10
years of the study with 39 cases of TDF use. There was a significant fixed effect
of time, with eGFR reduction of 4.6 mL/min (P < .001) over the course of the
study for the full cohort, but the effects of each medication were not
significant.
Conclusions: This multicenter, retrospective study did not demonstrate an
association between TDF use and a greater degree of kidney injury compared with
other NRTIs in patients with HBV, but further studies are warranted.
