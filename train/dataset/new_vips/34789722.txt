Seasonal shifts in phytoplankton accumulation and loss largely follow changes in 
mixed layer depth, but the impact of mixed layer depth on cell physiology remains
unexplored. Here, we investigate the physiological state of phytoplankton
populations associated with distinct bloom phases and mixing regimes in the North
Atlantic. Stratification and deep mixing alter community physiology and viral
production, effectively shaping accumulation rates. Communities in relatively
deep, early-spring mixed layers are characterized by low levels of stress and
high accumulation rates, while those in the recently shallowed mixed layers in
late-spring have high levels of oxidative stress. Prolonged stratification into
early autumn manifests in negative accumulation rates, along with pronounced
signatures of compromised membranes, death-related protease activity, virus
production, nutrient drawdown, and lipid markers indicative of nutrient stress.
Positive accumulation renews during mixed layer deepening with transition into
winter, concomitant with enhanced nutrient supply and lessened viral pressure.
