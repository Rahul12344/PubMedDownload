Racially and ethnically diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities
have historically been disproportionately affected by disasters and public health
emergencies in the United States. The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services' Office of Minority Health established the National Consensus Panel on
Emergency Preparedness and Cultural Diversity to provide guidance to agencies and
organizations on developing effective strategies to advance emergency
preparedness and eliminate disparities among racially and ethnically diverse
communities during these crises. Adopting the National Consensus Panel
recommendations, the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and
Health Equity; Language Services; and academic-community partnerships used
existing health equity resources and expertise to develop an operational
framework to support the organization's COVID-19 response and to provide a
framework of health equity initiatives for other academic medical centers. This
operational framework addressed policies to support health equity patient care
and clinical operations, accessible COVID-19 communication, and staff and
community support and engagement, which also supported the National Standards for
Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care.
Johns Hopkins Medicine identified expanded recommendations for addressing
institutional policy making and capacity building, including unconscious bias
training for resource allocation teams and staff training in accurate race,
ethnicity, and language data collection, that should be considered in future
updates to the National Consensus Panel's recommendations.
