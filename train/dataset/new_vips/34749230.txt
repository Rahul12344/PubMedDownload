Emerging infectious diseases caused by the spread of bacteria and viruses are a
major burden on global economic development and public health. At present, most
personal protective equipment has weak antibacterial and anti-viral properties.
The PAN/PTHP nanofibers reported in this article provide a new method for the
development of personal protective equipment. In this study, a mixture of PTHP
and PAN was prepared into PAN/PTHP nanofibers with high-efficiency and
long-lasting antibacterial effects (>99.999%) through the electrospinning
process. Live/dead staining and cell proliferation experiments showed that the
preparation of PAN/PTHP nanofibers has good cell compatibility. In addition,
PAN/PTHP nanofibers show obvious destructive effects on lentiviruses. Based on
these characteristics, PAN/PTHP nanofibers were applied to facial masks, which
can be used as the inflatable biocidal layer of facial masks and have an
excellent interception effect on particles in the air. The successful synthesis
of these fascinating materials may provide new insights for the development of
new protective materials.
