BACKGROUND: Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) increases the susceptibility to
primary infection or reinfection and the risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation
for patients with latent TB. There was no current report on the rate of active TB
infection among HIV-1 infected patients in our teaching and referral hospital.
Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the prevalence and factors
associated with active TB infection among HIV-1 infected patients.
METHODS: Hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the 
Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) chronic follow-up clinic. Systematic random
sampling was used to include the patients. A structured questionnaire was used to
collect data. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Descriptive statistics
were used to describe the findings and multivariate logistic regression was
performed to identify factors associated with active TB infection.
RESULT: 150 HIV-1 infected patients (female 54.7%) were included. The median
(interquartile range, IQR) age of the patients was 33.5 (25.7, 40.0) years.
Twenty-six (17.3%) of the patients had developed active TB infection, which was
independently associated with the WHO clinical stage III and IV (AOR: 9.67, 95%
confidence interval (CI); 2.21-42.37), p = 0.003). The use of isoniazid
preventive therapy (IPT) (AOR: 0.123, 95CI; 0.034-0.44, p = 0.001) and having
good adherence to ART medications (AOR: 0.076, 95CI; 0.007-0.80, p = 0.032) was
associated with the reduced risk of active TB infection among HIV-1 infected
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced WHO clinical stages increased the risk of active TB
infection, while the use of IPT and good adherence to ART medications reduced the
risk of active TB infection. Therefore, patients with advanced WHO clinical stage
should be screened for TB infection, and starting IPT for the candidate patients 
should be strengthened to reduce the burden of active TB incidence. ART
medication adherence should also be supported.
