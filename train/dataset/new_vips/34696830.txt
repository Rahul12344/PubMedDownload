Faithfull replication of genomic information relies on the coordinated activity
of the multi-protein machinery known as the replisome. Several constituents of
the replisome operate as molecular motors that couple thermal and chemical energy
to a mechanical task. Over the last few decades, in vitro single-molecule
manipulation techniques have been used to monitor and manipulate mechanically the
activities of individual molecular motors involved in DNA replication with
nanometer, millisecond, and picoNewton resolutions. These studies have uncovered 
the real-time kinetics of operation of these biological systems, the nature of
their transient intermediates, and the processes by which they convert energy to 
work (mechano-chemistry), ultimately providing new insights into their inner
workings of operation not accessible by ensemble assays. In this chapter, we
describe two of the most widely used single-molecule manipulation techniques for 
the study of DNA replication, optical and magnetic tweezers, and their
application in the study of the activities of proteins involved in viral DNA
replication.
