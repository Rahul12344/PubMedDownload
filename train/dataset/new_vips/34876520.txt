Single-dose vaccines with the ability to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication in the
respiratory tract are needed for all age groups, aiding efforts toward control of
COVID-19. We developed a live intranasal vector vaccine for infants and children 
against COVID-19 based on replication-competent chimeric bovine/human
parainfluenza virus type 3 (B/HPIV3) that express the native (S) or
prefusion-stabilized (S-2P) SARS-CoV-2 S spike protein, the major protective and 
neutralization antigen of SARS-CoV-2. B/HPIV3/S and B/HPIV3/S-2P replicated as
efficiently as B/HPIV3 in vitro and stably expressed SARS-CoV-2 S. Prefusion
stabilization increased S expression by B/HPIV3 in vitro. In hamsters, a single
intranasal dose of B/HPIV3/S-2P induced significantly higher titers compared to
B/HPIV3/S of serum SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (12-fold higher), serum IgA
and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (5-fold and 13-fold), and IgG to the receptor
binding domain (10-fold). Antibodies exhibited broad neutralizing activity
against SARS-CoV-2 of lineages A, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. Four weeks after
immunization, hamsters were challenged intranasally with 104.5 50% tissue-culture
infectious-dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2. In B/HPIV3 empty vector-immunized
hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 replicated to mean titers of 106.6 TCID50/g in lungs and 107
TCID50/g in nasal tissues and induced moderate weight loss. In
B/HPIV3/S-immunized hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus was reduced 20-fold in
nasal tissues and undetectable in lungs. In B/HPIV3/S-2P-immunized hamsters,
infectious challenge virus was undetectable in nasal tissues and lungs; B/HPIV3/S
and B/HPIV3/S-2P completely protected against weight loss after SARS-CoV-2
challenge. B/HPIV3/S-2P is a promising vaccine candidate to protect infants and
young children against HPIV3 and SARS-CoV-2.
