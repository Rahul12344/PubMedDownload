Bacteriophages (phages) are bacterial viruses, and have been used for more than a
century to combat bacterial infections, particularly in Poland and in the former 
Soviet Union. The antimicrobial resistance crisis has triggered a renewed
interest in the therapeutic use of natural phages. The capacity of phages to
specifically target pathogenic strains (sparing commensal bacteria), to adapt to 
these strains, and to rapidly overcome bacterial resistance, makes them suitable 
for flexible therapeutic approaches. To maximally exploit these advantages phages
offer over conventional 'static' drugs such as traditional small molecule-type
antibiotics, it is important that these sustainable phage products are not
submitted to the traditional (long and expensive) medicinal product development
and licensing pathways. Here we discuss the extrapolation of the Belgian
'magistral preparation' phage therapy framework to the European level, enabling
an expeditious re-introduction of personalized phage therapy into Europe.
