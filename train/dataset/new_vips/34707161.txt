Rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has helped mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread,
but more equitable allocation of vaccines is necessary to limit the global impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of additional variants of concern. We 
have developed a COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on Newcastle disease virus
(NDV) that can be manufactured at high yields in embryonated eggs. Here, we show 
that the NDV vector expressing an optimized spike antigen (NDV-HXP-S) is a
versatile vaccine inducing protective antibody responses. NDV-HXP-S can be
administered intramuscularly as inactivated vaccine or intranasally as live
vaccine. We show that NDV-HXP-S GMP-produced in Vietnam, Thailand and Brazil is
effective in the hamster model. Furthermore, we show that intramuscular
vaccination with NDV-HXP-S reduces replication of tested variants of concerns in 
mice. The immunity conferred by NDV-HXP-S effectively counteracts SARS-CoV-2
infection in mice and hamsters.
