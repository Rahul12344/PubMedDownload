Previous research has established that Lentinula edodes mycovirus HKB (LeV-HKB)
and L. edodes partitivirus 1(LePV1) are major mycoviruses identified in L.edodes 
germplasm. In this paper, two different methods for curing these two dsRNA
mycoviruses, ribavirin treatment and mycelial fragmentation, were evaluated for
the first time. Mycelial fragmentation was found to resulted in LeV-HKB- and
LePV1-cured fungal strains, whereas ribavirin treatment could eliminate LeV-HKB
only. Although no LePV1-cured strain was obtained via ribavirin treatment by the 
end of the experiment, the relative LePV1 concentration in the eighth successive 
subcultures was lower than that of the untreated control. The culture features of
several virus-cured strains had faster mycelial growth rate and higher colony
density than the infected ones. It was also suggested that LeV-HKB infection may 
affect the pigmentation in plate- and bag-cultivated mycelia of L. edodes strain 
L135.
