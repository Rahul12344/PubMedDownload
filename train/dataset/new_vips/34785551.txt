OBJECTIVES: Cause-of-death discrepancies are common in respiratory
illness-related mortality. A standard epidemiological metric, excess all-cause
death, is unaffected by these discrepancies but provides no actionable policy
information when increased all-cause mortality is unexplained by reported
specific causes. To assess the contribution of unexplained mortality to the
excess death metric, we parsed excess deaths in the COVID-19 pandemic into
changes in explained versus unexplained (unreported or unspecified) causes.
DESIGN: Retrospective repeated cross-sectional analysis, US death certificate
data for six influenza seasons beginning October 2014, comparing
population-adjusted historical benchmarks from the previous two, three and five
seasons with 2019-2020.
SETTING: 48 of 50 states with complete data.
PARTICIPANTS: 16.3 million deaths in 312 weeks, reported in categories-all
causes, top eight natural causes and respiratory causes including COVID-19.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in population-adjusted counts of deaths from seasonal
benchmarks to 2019-2020, from all causes (ie, total excess deaths) and from
explained versus unexplained causes, reported for the season overall and for time
periods defined a priori: pandemic awareness (19 January through 28 March);
initial pandemic peak (29 March through 30 May) and pandemic post-peak (31 May
through 26 September).
RESULTS: Depending on seasonal benchmark, 287 957-306 267 excess deaths occurred 
through September 2020: 179 903 (58.7%-62.5%) attributed to COVID-19; 44 022-49
311 (15.2%-16.1%) to other reported causes; 64 032-77 054 (22.2%-25.2%)
unexplained (unspecified or unreported cause). Unexplained deaths constituted
65.2%-72.5% of excess deaths from 19 January to 28 March and 14.1%-16.1% from 29 
March through 30 May.
CONCLUSIONS: Unexplained mortality contributed substantially to US pandemic
period excess deaths. Onset of unexplained mortality in February 2020 coincided
with previously reported increases in psychotropic use, suggesting possible
psychiatric or injurious causes. Because underlying causes of unexplained deaths 
may vary by group or region, results suggest excess death calculations provide
limited actionable information, supporting previous calls for improved
cause-of-death data to support evidence-based policy.
