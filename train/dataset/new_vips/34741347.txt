BACKGROUND: At present, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the world rapidly spread. It is a 
serious global public health emergency.
METHODS: In this study, we described the clinical characteristics of 11 COVID-19 
patients hospitalized in the Meizhou People's Hospital, and viral genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from these patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, six cases developed fever, 9 cases developed a
cough, and two cases developed headache and chills. Four patients (36.4%) had
underlying diseases. Pneumonia is the most common complication. The laboratory
test results showed that there were no adult patients with increased
lymphocyte/lymphocyte percentage (LYM/LYM%). Most patients had normal total
protein (TP) and albumin (ALB), but only two patients had decreased. Most
patients had increased or normal levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 
C reactive protein (CRP), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),
fibrinogen (FIB), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH). Neutrophil (NEU) (r = 0.664, p = 0.026), CK-MB (r = 0.655, p = 0.029) and 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (r = 0.682, p = 0.021) were significantly associated
with SARS-CoV-2 virus cycle threshold (Ct) value. Multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) shows that two different SNPs were identified at positions 8781 and 28144, 
and have a complete linkage genetic form of 8781C-28144T and 8781T-28144C.
CONCLUSIONS: The reports of the 11 COVID-19 patients in our hospital will provide
useful information for the diagnosis, treatment, and drug development of
SARS-CoV-2.
