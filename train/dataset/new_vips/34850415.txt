BACKGROUND: Although hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss is considered the
ideal therapeutic endpoint for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection, its impact on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.
AIM: To assess the impact of HBsAg loss on clinical outcomes following
spontaneous and treatment-related HBsAg loss.
METHODS: We searched PUBMED, Embase, the Cochrane library, and published
abstracts through to May 2021 for studies that reported HBsAg loss, had >1 year
of follow-up and reported at least one clinical outcome in adults with chronic
HBV infection.
RESULTS: We identified 57 studies (258 744 HBsAg-positive patients, 63 270 with
HBsAg loss). Based on 24 studies including 160 598 patients with and without
HBsAg loss, HBsAg loss was associated with a non-significant 23% relative risk
reduction of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to those who
remained HBsAg-positive (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.38-1.57). In subgroup meta-analysis
of 10 studies, treatment-related HBsAg loss was associated with a non-significant
higher pooled proportion of HCC (0.94%) compared to spontaneous HBsAg loss
(0.45%). HCC development after HBsAg loss was significantly higher in males,
those with underlying cirrhosis, and those with a family history of HCC. HBsAg
loss was associated with lower pooled proportions of incident cirrhosis, hepatic 
decompensation, overall and liver-related mortality compared to no HBsAg loss.
Substantial heterogeneity was noted across studies for all outcomes.
CONCLUSION: HBsAg loss is associated with a reduced risk of clinical outcomes.
However, several shortcomings in the published studies prevent a more definitive 
conclusion on the potential benefits of HBsAg loss.
