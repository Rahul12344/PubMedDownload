OBJECTIVES: To study the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care
workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID-19 patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a nested case-control study of health care
workers(HCWs) in a Dedicated COVID Hospital(DCH). The data collection was done
from Dec 2020 to Feb 2021. The study was part of an international multicenter
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO).2 The Doctors, nurses, housekeeping 
staff, clerks, and other staff working in this DCH were considered as HCWs. HCWs 
working in this DCH with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited as cases and other
HCWs working in this DCH in the same Ward/ICU/office without infection were
recruited as controls (incidence density sampling). Three controls were taken per
case. The questions were in the Likert scale.
RESULTS: There were 25 cases and their 75 controls. There was no significant
difference between cases and controls with respect to age, sex, occupation,
education, and comorbidities and all controls were negative for antibodies at the
time of the interview. Most (70%) of the HCWs were doctor by profession followed 
by nurses (19%). All HCWs were trained in IPC (infection Prevention and Control).
Most (96%) HCWs reported that PPE (personal protective equipment) is available in
sufficient quantity. There was no significant difference between cases and
controls with respect to those having direct contact with the patient's
materials, surroundings, and following hand hygiene.
CONCLUSION: Adequate availability of PPE, IPC training of HCWs are important for 
preventing COVID-19 but do not completely reduce risk among HCWs.
