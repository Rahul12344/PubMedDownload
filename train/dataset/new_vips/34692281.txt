During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, sundry dermatological conditions
related to COVID-19 pneumonia have been published. COVID-19 primarily affects the
respiratory system, but secondarily it also affects the heart, kidney, brain,
skin, spinal cord, etc. Herpes Zoster (HZ) is considerably important morbidity
associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Recrudescence of HZ occurs because of the
latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) predominantly because of the decline in
cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Abating CMI is due to the increasing age, but could
also occur if the patient is suffering from an immunosuppressive disease or is
using immunosuppressive drugs. In our case, the patient had no lymphopenia unlike
the other cases, yet still, he developed HZ. HZ is associated with post-herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN), HZ ophthalmicus (HZO), and cerebral arteritis increasing
morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly people and those who are
immunocompromised.
