Nursing education programs faced multiple challenges to increase the size,
diversity, and skill set of the nursing workforce while contending with shortage 
of clinical placement sites and retiring faculty. A program that is unable to be 
resilient in the face of crisis will fail in its mission to graduate resilient
nurses. The purpose of this paper is to describe how nursing programs can respond
to the challenge of creating a resilient program poised to graduate a diverse,
inclusive, and resilient workforce. Utilizing resilience-oriented strategies to
impact educational services solidified program relevancy, promoted student
belonging, and enhanced student recruitment/retention. While programs have become
accustomed to doing more with fewer resources, many of these programs may not
survive these unprecedented times without incorporating a holistic approach for
organizational well-being that promotes resilience through inclusivity.
