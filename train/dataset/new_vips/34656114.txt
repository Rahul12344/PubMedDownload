BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused significant healthcare service disruptions.
Surgical backlogs have been estimated but not for other healthcare services. This
study aims to estimate the backlog of preventive care services caused by
COVID-19.
METHODS: This observational study assessed preventive care screening rates at
three primary care clinics in Ottawa, Ontario from March to November 2020 using
data from 22,685 electronic medical records. The change in cervical cancer,
colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes screening rates were crudely estimated
using 2016 census data, estimating the volume of key services delayed by COVID-19
across Ontario and Canada.
RESULTS: The mean percentage of patients appropriately screened for cervical
cancer decreased by 7.5% (- 0.3% to - 14.7%; 95% CI), colorectal cancer decreased
by 8.1% (- 0.3% to - 15.8%; 95% CI), and type 2 diabetes decreased by 4.5%
(- 0.2% to - 8.7%; 95% CI). Crude estimates imply 288,000 cervical cancer (11,000
to 565,000; 95% CI), 326,000 colorectal cancer (13,000 to 638,000; 95% CI), and
274,000 type 2 diabetes screenings (13,000 to 535,000; 95% CI) may be overdue in 
Ontario. Nationally the deficits may be tripled these numbers. Re-opening
measures have not reversed these trends.
INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 decreased the delivery of preventive care services,
which may cause delayed diagnoses, increased mortality, and increased health care
costs. Virtual care and reopening measures have not restored the provision of
preventive care services. Electronic medical record data could be leveraged to
improve screening via panel management. Additional, system-wide primary care and 
laboratory capacity will be needed to restore pre-COVID-19 screening rates.
