Due to COVID-19 travel disruptions, the International Association of Breath
Research hosted the planned 2021 Breath Summit virtually as a symposium with oral
and poster presentations. The event was comprised of a week-long social media
asynchronous online event for sharing research abstracts, posters and
discussions. Subsequently, there were two days of real-time webinar platform
interactions each featuring three technical presentations, open forum questions, 
answers, and commentary. The symposium was well attended and well received. It
allowed the breath community to share new research and to reconnect with
colleagues and friends. This report presents an overview of the topics presented 
and various salient discussion points.
