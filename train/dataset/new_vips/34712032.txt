BACKGROUND: Little is known about the engagement in hepatitis C virus (HCV) care 
and completion of HCV treatment in people living with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) (PLWH) who have HCV coinfection in the Asia-Pacific region. Examining
the HCV care cascade can identify barriers to the completion of HCV treatment and
facilitate achievement of HCV micro-elimination in PLWH.
AIM: To investigate the care cascade of incident HCV infections among PLWH in
Taiwan.
METHODS: PLWH with incident HCV infections, defined as HCV seroconversion, were
retrospectively identified by sequential anti-HCV testing of all archived blood
samples at National Taiwan University Hospital between 2011 and 2018. All PLWH
with incident HCV infections were followed until December 31, 2019. The care
cascade of HCV examined included all incident HCV-infected patients, the
percentages of anti-HCV antibodies detected by HIV-treating physicians in
clinical care, plasma HCV RNA load tested, HCV RNA positivity diagnosed, referral
to treatment assessment made, anti-HCV treatment initiated, and sustained
virologic response achieved. Those who had HCV seroconversion during the
interferon (IFN) era (2011-2016) and the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era
(2017-2018) were analyzed separately. The duration of HCV viremia-from the date
of seroconversion to viral clearance by treatments or until the end of
observation-and the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during
the HCV viremic period were estimated.
RESULTS: During the study period, 287 of 3495 (8.2%) PLWH (92.3% being men who
have sex with men) who were HCV-seronegative at baseline developed HCV
seroconversion by retrospective testing of all archived blood samples. Of the 287
incident HCV infections, 277 (96.5%) had anti-HCV antibodies detected by
HIV-treating physicians, 270 (94.1%) had plasma HCV RNA determined and 251
(87.5%) tested positive for HCV RNA. Of those with HCV viremia, 226 (78.7%) were 
referred to treatment assessment, 215 (74.9%) initiated anti-HCV treatment, and
202 (70.4%) achieved viral clearance. Compared with that in the IFN era, the
median interval from HCV seroconversion by retrospective testing to detection of 
HCV seropositivity by HIV-treating physicians was significantly shorter in the
DAA era {179 d [interquartile range (IQR) 87-434] vs 92 d (IQR 57-173); P <
0.001}. The incidence rate of STIs in the DAA vs the IFN era was 50.5 per 100
person-years of follow-up (PYFU) and 38.5 per 100 PYFU, respectively, with an
incidence rate ratio of 1.31 (95% confidence interval 0.96-1.77), while the
duration of HCV viremia was 380 d (IQR 274-554) and 735 d (IQR 391-1447) (P <
0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: While anti-HCV therapies are effective in achieving viral clearance, 
our study suggests more efforts are needed to expedite the linkage of PLWH
diagnosed with incident HCV infections to HCV treatment.
