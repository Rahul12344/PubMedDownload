BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, patients with confirmed cases in New York State accounted for roughly
25% of total US cases, with psychiatric hospital in-patients at particularly high
risk for COVID-19 infection.
AIMS: The beneficial effects of mental health medications, such as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on the severity of COVID-19 disease
outcomes have been documented. Protective effects against infection have also
been suggested for these medications. We therefore tested the hypothesis that
medication use modifies the risk of COVID-19 infection in a long-stay, chronic
in-patient psychiatry setting, where the potential for exposure was likely
uniform across the facility, and where these medications were routinely
prescribed.
METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort study of an adult psychiatric facility
operated by the New York State Office of Mental Health. Current medication
information and COVID-19 status was collected from electronic medical records for
165 people who were in-patients during the period January to July 2020, and
logistic regression was employed to model the main effects of medication use on
COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: A significant protective association was observed between antidepressant
use and COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.70, adjusted P 
< 0.05). Analysis of individual antidepressant classes showed that SSRI,
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and the serotonin-2 antagonist
reuptake inhibitor classes of antidepressants, drove this protective effect.
Exploratory analyses of individual antidepressants demonstrated an association
between lower risk of infection and fluoxetine use (P = 0.023), as well as
trazodone use (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel finding of reduced COVID-19 infection risk for psychiatric
in-patients taking antidepressants, suggests that antidepressants may be an
important weapon in the continued fight against COVID-19 disease. This finding
may become particularly salient for in-patient settings if vaccine-resistant
strains of the virus appear.
