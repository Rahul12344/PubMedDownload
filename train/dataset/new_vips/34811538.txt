Although critical to T cell function, antigen specificity is often omitted in
high-throughput multiomics-based T cell profiling due to technical challenges. We
describe a high-dimensional, tetramer-associated T cell antigen receptor (TCR)
sequencing (TetTCR-SeqHD) method to simultaneously profile cognate antigen
specificities, TCR sequences, targeted gene expression and surface-protein
expression from tens of thousands of single cells. Using human polyclonal CD8+ T 
cells with known antigen specificity and TCR sequences, we demonstrate over 98%
precision for detecting the correct antigen specificity. We also evaluate gene
expression and phenotypic differences among antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and
characterize phenotype signatures of influenza- and Epstein-Barr virus-specific
CD8+ T cells that are unique to their pathogen targets. Moreover, with the
high-throughput capacity of profiling hundreds of antigens simultaneously, we
apply TetTCR-SeqHD to identify antigens that preferentially enrich cognate CD8+ T
cells in patients with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls and discover 
a TCR that cross-reacts with diabetes-related and microbiome antigens.
TetTCR-SeqHD is a powerful approach for profiling T cell responses in humans and 
mice.
