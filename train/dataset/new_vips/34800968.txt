BACKGROUND: Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is one of the most convenient and
powerful methods of reverse genetics. In vitro-inoculation of plant virus is an
important method for studying the interactions between viruses and plants.
Agrobacterium-based infiltration has been widely adopted as a tool for VIGS and
in vitro-inoculation of plant virus. Most agrobacterium-based infiltration
methods applied to VIGS and virus inoculation have the characteristics of low
transformation efficiencies, long plant growth time, large amounts of plant
tissue, large test spaces, and complex preparation procedures. Therefore, a
rapid, simple, economical, and highly efficient VIGS and virus inoculation method
is in need. Previous studies have shown that the selection of suitable plant
tissues and inoculation sites is the key to successful infection.
RESULTS: In this study, Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) mediated VIGS and Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) for virus inoculation were developed in tomato
plants based on the agrobacterium tumefaciens-based infiltration by injection of 
the no-apical-bud stem section (INABS). The no-apical-bud stem section had a "Y- 
type" asymmetric structure and contained an axillary bud that was about 1-3 cm in
length. This protocol provides high transformation (56.7%) and inoculation
efficiency (68.3%), which generates VIGS transformants or diseased plants in a
very short period (8 dpi). Moreover, it greatly reduces the required experimental
space. This method will facilitate functional genomic studies and large-scale
disease resistance screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a rapid, simple, and highly efficient method for VIGS and
virus inoculation by INABS was developed in tomato. It was reasonable to believe 
that it can be used as a reference for the other virus inoculation methods and
for the application of VIGS to other crops (such as sweet potato, potato, cassava
and tobacco) that develop axillary buds and can survive from cuttings.
