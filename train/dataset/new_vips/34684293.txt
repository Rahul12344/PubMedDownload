PRRSV is one of the most important viruses in the global swine industry and is
often controlled by the use of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines. This study
assessed the impact of a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine applied to 1-day-old piglets
challenged on day 28 of life with a PRRSV-1 field isolate (AUT15-33). Twenty-one 
piglets were vaccinated within 24 h of birth (T02), whereas 20 piglets were left 
unvaccinated (T01). Necropsy was performed two weeks post-challenge. Comparing
the two groups, T02 piglets showed significantly higher (p = 0.017) average daily
weight gain. In addition, significantly lower (p < 0.0001) PRRSV RNA loads were
measured in serum of T02 piglets at all investigated time points. All T01 piglets
were viremic and shed virus in nasal swabs, whereas only 71.4% and 38.1% of the
T02 group were viremic or shed virus, respectively. Piglets from T02 had
significantly higher numbers (p < 0.0001) of IFN-γ producing lymphocytes compared
to T01. At necropsy, differences in gross and histologic lung lesions were
statistically significant (p = 0.012 and p < 0.0001, respectively) between the
two groups. Hence, this MLV vaccine administered to 1-day-old piglets was able to
protect piglets against PRRSV infection at weaning.
