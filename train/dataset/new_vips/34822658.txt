The peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) mainly infects goats and sheep and
causes a highly contagious disease, PPR. Recently, a PPRV strain named
ChinaSX2020 was isolated and confirmed following an indirect immunofluorescence
assay and PCR using PPRV-specific antibody and primers, respectively. A
sequencing of the ChinaSX2020 strain showed a genome length of 15,954
nucleotides. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the ChinaSX2020 genome was 
classified into lineage IV of the PRRV genotypes. The genome of the ChinaSX2020
strain was found to be closely related to PPRVs isolated in China between 2013
and 2014. These findings revealed that not a variety of PRRVs but similar PPRVs
were continuously spreading and causing sporadic outbreaks in China.
