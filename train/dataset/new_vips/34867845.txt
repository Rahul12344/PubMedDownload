In the present study, we identified a novel, positive-sense single-stranded RNA
virus in the Chinese black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon. It has a genome length of
11,312 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tails, and contains five open reading
frames. The ORF2 encodes the conserved domains of RNA helicase and RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase, while ORF4 and 5 encode three viral proteins. Herein, the A.
ipsilon virus was clustered with a Helicoverpa armigera Nora virus and was thus
provisionally named "Agrotis ipsilon Nora virus" (AINV). AINV was successfully
transmitted into a novel host, Spodoptera frugiperda, through injection, causing 
a stable infection. This found the possibility of horizontal AINV transmission
among moths belonging to the same taxonomic family. Nonetheless, AINV infection
was deleterious to S. frugiperda and mainly mediated by antiviral and amino acid 
metabolism-related pathways. Furthermore, the infection significantly increased
the S. frugiperda larval period but significantly reduced its moth eclosion rate.
It suggests that AINV is probably to be a parasitic virus of S. frugiperda.
