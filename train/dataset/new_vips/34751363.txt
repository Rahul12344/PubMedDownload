Individuals with chronic diseases are more susceptible to its grave complications
and negative outcomes if infected by COVID-19. Furthermore, mandatory isolation
and cancellations of routine healthcare services led to the disruption of the
screening and management plans for chronic diseases. Fear of attending health
services as well as disruptions to public transport are other factors increasing 
health risks among persons with chronic conditions during the pandemic. Ensuring 
access to universal healthcare services, increasing use of digital services,
targeted interventions to risk groups are examples of measures that need to be
taken when reviewing health systems preparedness for future pandemics and other
disasters.
