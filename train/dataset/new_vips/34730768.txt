OBJECTIVE: to analyze the scientific evidence available on the different
reprocessing methods and the necessary conditions for reuse of the N95 face
respirator mask or equivalent.
METHOD: an integrative literature review. The PICO strategy was used to elaborate
the question. The search was conducted in four databases: PubMed, SciVerse
Scopus, WebofScience and EMBASE, considering any period of time.
RESULTS: a total of 32 studies were included from the 561 studies identified, and
they were presented in two categories: "Conditions for reuse" and "Reprocessing
the masks". Of the evaluated research studies, seven(21.8%) addressed the reuse
of the N95 face respirator mask or equivalent and 25(78.1%) evaluated different
reprocessing methods, namely: ultraviolet germicidal irradiation(14); hydrogen
peroxide(8); vapor methods(14); using dry heat(5) and chemical methods(sodium
hypochlorite[6], ethanol[4] and sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate and
dimethyldioxirane[1]). We emphasize that different methods were used in one same 
article.
CONCLUSION: no evidence was found to support safe reprocessing of face respirator
masks. In addition, reuse is contraindicated due to the risk of
self-contamination and inadequate sealing.
