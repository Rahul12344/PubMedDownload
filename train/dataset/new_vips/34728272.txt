The hepatoma cell lines stably expressing sodium taurocholate cotransporting
polypeptide (NTCP), the receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, serve as
important infection models for studying viral biology and drug discovery.
However, the efficiency of infection greatly varies. In this study, we studied
the effects and potential mechanisms of Matrigel® hESC-qualified (M-hq), a
biological basement membrane matrix commonly used in cell culture, on promotion
HBV in vitro infection in HepG2-NTCP cells. For the first time, our findings
demonstrate that M-hq could enhance the infection efficiency of cell
culture-derived HBV with no impact on the cell viability, the HBV transcription
and response to antiviral treatments. The infection enhancement is reproducible
and is suggested to occur at HBV attachment step. Our study suggests that this
novel system is applicable for studying HBV biology and new drugs.
