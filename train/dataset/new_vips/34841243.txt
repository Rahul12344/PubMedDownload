Background: A characteristic feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its ability to transmit
from pre- or asymptomatic patients, complicating the tracing of infection
pathways and causing outbreaks. Despite several reports that whole genome
sequencing (WGS) and haplotype networks are useful for epidemiologic analysis,
little is known about their use in nosocomial infections.
Aim: We aimed to demonstrate the advantages of genetic epidemiology in
identifying the link in nosocomial infection by comparing single nucleotide
variations (SNVs) of isolates from patients associated with an outbreak in Showa 
University Hospital.
Methods: We used specimens from 32 patients in whom COVID-19 had been diagnosed
using clinical reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests. RNA of
SARS-CoV-2 from specimens was reverse-transcribed and analysed using WGS. SNVs
were extracted and used for lineage determination, phylogenetic tree analysis,
and median-joining analysis.
Findings: The lineage of SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with outbreak in Showa
University Hospital was B.1.1.214, which was consistent with that found in the
Kanto metropolitan area during the same period. Consistent with canonical
epidemiological observations, haplotype network analysis was successful for the
classification of patients. Additionally, phylogenetic tree analysis revealed
three independent introductions of the virus into the hospital during the
outbreak. Further, median-joining analysis indicated that four patients were
directly infected by any of the others in the same cluster.
Conclusion: Genetic epidemiology with WGS and haplotype networks is useful for
tracing transmission and optimizing prevention strategies in nosocomial
outbreaks.
