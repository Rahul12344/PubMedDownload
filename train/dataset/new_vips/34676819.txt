The incidence of most respiratory-transmitted diseases decreased during the
COVID-19 pandemic as a result of containment measures. In contrast, in the
Netherlands we noted an increase in invasive disease caused by Haemophilus
influenzae b (Hib) (from < 0.3/100,000 before 2019 to 0.39 and 0.33/100,000 in
2020 and 2021) in vaccinated and unvaccinated age groups. We did not find a
change in vaccine effectiveness against Hib invasive disease
(effectiveness > 90%). We discuss factors that may have contributed to this rise.
