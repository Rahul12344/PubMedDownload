OBJECTIVE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are high-risk groups of human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the best measure to prevent this is the HPV
vaccine. However, few studies have investigated HPV vaccination willingness in
the MSM population in China. We aimed to explore the willingness of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative MSM for HPV vaccination and the factors
affecting their willingness to vaccinate.
METHODS: We adopted a non-probability sampling method to recruit HIV-negative MSM
volunteers. Participants completed a questionnaire, including sociodemographic
characteristics, sexual behavior characteristics, HPV infection and
vaccine-related knowledge, risk perception, and HPV vaccination willingness and
promotion attitudes.
RESULTS: Of the 406 HIV-negative MSM surveyed, 86.21% were willing to receive HPV
vaccine. HPV infection and vaccine-related knowledge (odds ratio [OR] = 2.167,
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.049-4.474), HPV infection risk perception (OR = 
5.905, 95% CI = 1.312-26.580), and HPV vaccine promotion attitude (OR = 6.784,
95% CI = 3.164-14.546) were all related to HPV vaccination willingness.
CONCLUSION: MSM have a high willingness for HPV vaccination. Strengthening health
education for MSM, raising their awareness of HPV infection and vaccines, and
promoting their risk perception of HPV infection will help increase their
willingness for HPV vaccination.
