In order to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has lasted 
for nearly two years, it is most necessary to introduce antiviral drugs specific 
to COVID-19 along with the establishment of herd immunity by vaccination.
Candidates currently being studied include nucleoside analogues that inhibit
replication, protease inhibitors, and entry blockers. Not only the virus itself, 
but also the host protein that the virus uses in its pathogenesis is the target
of treatment. Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will
not be completely eradicated, if the use of antiviral drugs is established, the
COVID-19 pandemic will end through coexistence with the virus.
