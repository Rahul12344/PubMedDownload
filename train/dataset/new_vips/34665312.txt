The genome of most plant viruses consists of a single positive-strand of RNA
(+ ssRNA). Successful replication of these viruses is fully dependent on the
endomembrane system of the infected cells, which experiences a massive
proliferation and a profound reshaping that enables assembly of the
macromolecular complexes where virus genome replication occurs. Assembly of these
viral replicase complexes (VRCs) requires a highly orchestrated interplay of
multiple virus and co-opted host cell factors to create an optimal
microenvironment for efficient assembly and functioning of the virus genome
replication machinery. It is now widely accepted that VRC formation involves the 
recruitment of high levels of sterols, but the specific role of these essential
components of cell membranes and the precise molecular mechanisms underlying
sterol enrichment at VRCs are still poorly known. In this review, we intend to
summarize the most relevant knowledge on the role of sterols in ( +)ssRNA virus
replication and discuss the potential of manipulating the plant sterol pathway to
help plants fight these infectious agents.
