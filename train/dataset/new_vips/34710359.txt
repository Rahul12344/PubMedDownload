BACKGROUND: Non-exclusive voluntary licensing that is access-oriented has been
suggested as an option to increase access to medicines to address the COVID-19
pandemic. To date, there has been little research on the effect of licensing,
mainly focused on economic and supply chain considerations, and not on the
benefits in terms of health outcomes. We aimed to study the economic and health
effect of voluntary licensing for medicines for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: A robust modelling framework was created to examine the difference
between scenarios, with (factual) and without (counterfactual) a Medicines Patent
Pool (MPP) licence for two medicines, dolutegravir and daclatasvir. Data were
obtained from MPP licensees, as well as a large number of external sources. The
primary outcomes were the cost savings and health impact between scenarios with
and without MPP licences across all LMICs. Through its licences, MPP had access
to the volumes and prices of licensed generic products sold in all covered
countries on a quarterly basis. These data informed the volumes, prices, and
uptake for the past factual scenarios and were the basis for modelling the future
factual scenarios. These scenarios were then compared with a set of
counterfactual scenarios in the absence of the studied licences.
FINDINGS: Cumulatively, between 2017 and 2032, the model's central assumptions
predicted an additional uptake of 15·494 (range 14·406-15·494) million
patient-years of dolutegravir-based HIV treatments, 151 839 (34 575-312 973)
deaths averted, and US$3·074 (1·837-5·617) billion saved through the MPP licence 
compared with the counterfactual scenario. For daclatasvir-based HCV treatments, 
the cumulative effect from 2015 to 2026 was predicted to be an additional uptake 
of 428 244 (127 584-636 270) patients treated with daclatasvir, 4070 (225-6323)
deaths averted, and $107·593 (30·377-121·284) million saved with the licence
compared with the counterfactual scenario.
INTERPRETATION: The chain of effects linking upstream licensing to downstream
outcomes can be modelled. Accordingly, credible quantitative estimates of
economic and health effects arising from access-oriented voluntary licensing were
obtained based on assumptions that early generic competition leads to price
reductions that influence procurement decisions and enable the faster and broader
uptake of recommended medicines, with beneficial economic and health effects.
