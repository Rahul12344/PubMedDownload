Purpose: Seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 within university systems is poorly
studied, making evidence-based discussions of educational system reopening
difficult. Moreover, few studies evaluate how antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are
maintained over time. We assessed serological response against the SARS-CoV-2
virus among our university students and staff.
Patients and Methods: In this prospective cohort study, seroprevalence was
determined in 705 randomly selected volunteers, members of the Faculty of
Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Alcalá, using a
chemiluminescent Siemens' SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay for total antibodies. Positive
samples were tested for IgG and IgM/IgA using VIRCLIA® MONOTEST (Vircell). A
first analysis took place during June 2020, and in those testing positive, a
determination of secondary outcomes was performed in November 2020.
Results: A total of 130 subjects showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (18.5%, 95%
CI, 15.8-21.5%). Of these, IgM/IgA was positive in 27 and indeterminate in 19;
IgG was positive in 118, indeterminate in 1. After 23 weeks, among 102 volunteers
remeasured, IgG became undetectable in 6. Presence of antibodies was associated, 
in multivariable logistic regression, with exposure to infected patients (31.3%) 
[OR 1.84, 95% CI, 1.14-2.96; P = 0.012], presence of COVID-19 symptoms (52.4%)
[OR 6.88, 95% CI, 4.28-11.06; P < 0.001], and confirmed earlier infection (82.9%)
[OR 11.87, 95% CI, 4.26-33.07; P < 0.001].
Conclusions: The faculty of medicine and health sciences personnel and students
of our university showed a high infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 during 2020
associated with providing clinical care to infected patients. This emphasizes the
importance of the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most
exposed health personnel, including health science students.
