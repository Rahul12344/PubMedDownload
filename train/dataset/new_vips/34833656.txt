The current population worldwide extensively uses social media to share thoughts,
societal issues, and personal concerns. Social media can be viewed as an
intelligent platform that can be augmented with a capability to analyze and
predict various issues such as business needs, environmental needs, election
trends (polls), governmental needs, etc. This has motivated us to initiate a
comprehensive search of the COVID-19 pandemic-related views and opinions amongst 
the population on Twitter. The basic training data have been collected from
Twitter posts. On this basis, we have developed research involving ensemble deep 
learning techniques to reach a better prediction of the future evolutions of
views in Twitter when compared to previous works that do the same. First, feature
extraction is performed through an N-gram stacked autoencoder supervised learning
algorithm. The extracted features are then involved in a classification and
prediction involving an ensemble fusion scheme of selected machine learning
techniques such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random
forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). all individual results are
combined/fused for a better prediction by using both mean and mode techniques.
Our proposed scheme of an N-gram stacked encoder integrated in an ensemble
machine learning scheme outperforms all the other existing competing techniques
such unigram autoencoder, bigram autoencoder, etc. Our experimental results have 
been obtained from a comprehensive evaluation involving a dataset extracted from 
open-source data available from Twitter that were filtered by using the keywords 
"covid", "covid19", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "sarscov2", and "covid_19".
