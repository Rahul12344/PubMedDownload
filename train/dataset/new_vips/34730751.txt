OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 2020 all-cause and COVID-19 excess mortality according
to sex, age, race/color, and state, and to compare mortality rates by selected
causes with that of the five previous years in Brazil.
METHODS: Data from the Mortality Information System were used. Expected deaths
for 2020 were estimated from 2015 to 2019 data using a negative binomial
log-linear model.
RESULTS: Excess deaths in Brazil in 2020 amounted to 13.7%, and the ratio of
excess deaths to COVID-19 deaths was 0.90. Reductions in deaths from
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases, and external causes, and an 
increase in ill-defined causes were all noted. Excess deaths were also found to
be heterogeneous, being higher in the Northern, Center-Western, and Northeastern 
states. In some states, the number of COVID-19 deaths was lower than that of
excess deaths, whereas the opposite occurred in others. Moreover, excess deaths
were higher in men aged 20 to 59, and in black, yellow, or indigenous
individuals. Meanwhile, excess mortality was lower in women, in individuals aged 
80 years or older, and in whites. Additionally, deaths among those aged 0 to 19
were 7.2% lower than expected, with reduction in mortality from respiratory
diseases and external causes. There was also a drop in mortality due to external 
causes in men and in those aged 20 to 39 years. Moreover, reductions in deaths
from CVD and neoplasms were noted in some states and groups.
CONCLUSION: There is evidence of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths and of the
possible impact of restrictive measures in the reduction of deaths from external 
causes and respiratory diseases. The impacts of COVID-19 on mortality were
heterogeneous among the states and groups, revealing that regional, demographic, 
socioeconomic, and racial differences expose individuals in distinct ways to the 
risk of death from both COVID-19 and other causes.
