Pulmonary diseases present a significant burden worldwide and lead to severe
morbidity and mortality. Lung inflammation caused by interactions with either
viruses, bacteria or fungi is a prominent characteristic of many pulmonary
diseases. Tobacco smoke and E-cig use ("vaping") are considered major risk
factors in the development of pulmonary disease as well as worsening disease
prognosis. However, at present, relatively little is known about the mechanistic 
actions by which smoking and vaping may worsen the disease. One theory suggests
that long-term vaping leads to Ca2+ signaling dysregulation. Ca2+ is an important
secondary messenger in signal transduction. Cellular Ca2+ concentrations are
mediated by a complex series of pumps, channels, transporters and exchangers that
are responsible for triggering various intracellular processes such as cell
death, proliferation and secretion. In this review, we provide a detailed
understating of the complex series of components that mediate Ca2+ signaling and 
how their dysfunction may result in pulmonary disease. Furthermore, we summarize 
the recent literature investigating the negative effects of smoking and vaping on
pulmonary disease, cell toxicity and Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we summarize
Ca2+-mediated pharmacological interventions that could potentially lead to novel 
treatments for pulmonary diseases.
