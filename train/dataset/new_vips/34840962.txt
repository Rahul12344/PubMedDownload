The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has caused unprecedented damage to the global economy. Diagnostic
testing is a key factor in limiting virus transmission and safeguarding public
health. We present the fabrication process of a paper-based device that uses
reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect 
SARS-CoV-2 in complex matrices by providing a colorimetric response apparent to
the naked eye. Because of LAMP's functionality, this device just requires a
simple heat source (e.g., water bath, incubator), it can be deployed in
resource-constrained areas and can be used as a supplement to current
point-of-care (POC) and community testing procedures. Since the test is based on 
nucleic acids, the testing platform itself lends to further applications
including food safety monitoring, animal diagnostics, etc. simply by changing the
specific primers.•We developed a platform capable of on-paper detection of
SARS-CoV-2 using colorimetric reporters that produce responses visible to the
naked eye.•The platform is easily reconfigurable to target different pathogens by
changing the primer sets, and multiplexing is possible by adding additional
reaction sites to the device.
