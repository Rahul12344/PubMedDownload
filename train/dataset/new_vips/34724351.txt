Classical swine fever (CSF) is caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and
has led to huge economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Although
vaccination and other control measures have been carried out, it is essential to 
establish a rapid and valid method for CSF vaccination monitoring and clinical
diagnosis. The CSFV E2 protein has been widely used as a major antigen for
antibody detection. It is important to improve the affinity between the E2
protein and CSFV antibodies to improve the performance of the detection method.
In this study, a recombinant E2 extracellular protein (amino acids 1-331) with a 
native homodimer conformation and high affinity for the anti-CSFV-E2 monoclonal
antibody WH303 was expressed using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. A 
novel immunochromatographic test strip based on the recombinant CSFV E2 protein
was developed for CSFV antibody detection. The sensitivity of this strip for
detecting CSFV standard-positive serum was 1:102400, 4 times higher than that of 
the previously developed CnC2 test strip. No cross-reactivity with antibodies of 
other swine viruses was observed. Detection of clinical swine serum samples (n = 
813) demonstrated that the agreements of this E2 test strip with three commercial
ELISA kits were 97.17% (790/813), 95.94% (780/813), and 93.73% (762/813),
respectively. Our data indicate that a novel E2 test strip with enhanced
sensitivity has been developed and can be applied for clinical sample detection, 
providing a new, powerful and simple approach for CSFV antibody monitoring. This
