Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more
than 180 million people since the onset of the global pandemic. Despite similar
viral load and infectivity rates between children and adults, children rarely
develop severe illness. Differences in the host response to the virus at the
primary infection site are among the mechanisms proposed to account for this
disparity. Our objective was to investigate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 in
the nasal mucosa in children and adults and compare it to the host response to
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (IV). We analyzed clinical 
outcomes and gene expression in the nasal mucosa of 36 children with SARS-CoV-2, 
24 children with RSV, 9 children with IV, 16 adults with SARS-CoV-2, and 7
healthy pediatric and 13 healthy adult controls. In both children and adults,
infection with SARS-CoV-2 led to an interferon response in the nasal mucosa. The 
magnitude of the interferon response correlated with the abundance of viral
reads, not the severity of illness, and was comparable between children and
adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 and children with severe RSV infection.
Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 did not correlate with age or presence of viral
infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected adults had increased expression of genes involved 
in neutrophil activation and T cell receptor signaling pathways compared to
SARS-CoV-2-infected children, despite similar severity of illness and viral
reads. Age-related differences in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may place
adults at increased risk of developing severe illness. This article is open
