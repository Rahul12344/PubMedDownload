OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the patterns of occupational COVID-19 cases, based on
compensation claims applied to the Italian National Institute for Insurance
against Accidents at Work (Inail).
DESIGN: descriptive analyses of daily time series of compensation claims
applications, geographical distributions, and occupations involved. Multivariate 
analyses have been performed for identifying significant epidemiological pattern.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: compensation claims for COVID-19 injuries received by
Inail from March 2020 to February 2021 have been analysed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: daily time series of compensation claims applications in
the first year of pandemic and comparatively with population data, patterns of
occupations majorly involved in time, territorial clusters.
RESULTS: in the observed period, Inail has received 155,684 workers' compensation
claims with a first peak (more than 1,000 daily compensation claims) in March
2020 and a second peak (more than 1,500) in November 2020. A time dependent
geographical pattern was identified, with the Northern regions formerly affected 
in the first phase, followed by a diffusion in the Central and Southern regions
during the summer period. Health technicians (32% and 42% in male and female,
respectively) and physicians (15%and 6%) were the most involved workers. The
timing of infection was found to depend by job, with physicians, nurses, and
health technicians firstly involved with a spread of about 2 weeks with respect
to other jobs. Trend in health workers' vaccination has been found in a clear
inverse relationship with the decreasing number of compensation claims,
remaining, since February 2021, under one hundred daily cases of occupational
COVID-19 compensation claims.
CONCLUSIONS: different intensities, timing, and characteristics were found among 
application claims, which address for different pandemic diffusion paths. Health 
workers are the firstly and most involved impacted by the pandemic. The use of
application claims could be useful and effective in monitoring the occupational
component of COVID-19 and his trend in time and space. There is a need to
establish an epidemiological surveillance system that includes the assessment of 
work related risk, supporting the effectiveness of public insurance and welfare
system, and to harmonize occupational data collection among countries.
