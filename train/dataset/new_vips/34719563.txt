The pandemic of COVID-19 has drastically changed the education program in
universities. An on-demand lecture is one of the common approaches, which are
employed to prevent the infection form spreading in the classroom. On-demand
lectures generally have a good reception of the students for the reason that they
could repeatedly play back the video when needed and attend the class in a
relaxed attitude as they like. On the other hand, we often have some concerns
about their understanding of the lecture because we could not get enough feedback
during the preparation of the video lectures. In addition, majority of us,
beginners of on-demand lectures, have to overcome the difficulties in utilizing
various tools to support them. Here, I would like to introduce some tips of
on-demand lectures. One, who delivers a chalk talk, should obtain a good pen
tablet and a suitable video recording software. Because video lectures with a
large data size interrupt the comfortable views of the students, the video files 
should be compressed using a special software. Approachable Q&A systems should
greatly enhance the learning efficiency and open the door to the flip teaching.
Blended learning, in which face-to-face learning is combined with video lectures 
to enhance the understanding, has recently attracted more attention in the field 
of education. The pandemic of COVID-19 might bring a good opportunity to brush up
and improve our classes.
