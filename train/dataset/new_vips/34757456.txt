BACKGROUND: In 2019, an estimated 296 million people were living with chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) globally with approximately 2.4 million living within the
United States. Those living with HBV require years if not decades of regular
monitoring to prevent liver complications from occurring. The aim of this study
was to explore the working conceptual framework of health related quality of life
(HRQL) for those living with chronic HBV through qualitative analysis.
METHODS: Data were collected by in-depth telephone interviews conducted in 2019
using purposeful sampling as part of a disease understanding assessment on the
HBV patient experience within the United States. A directed content analysis
approach was utilized by creation of a codebook to guide the organization of
data, codes were developed by review of the literature (a priori) and through
line-by-line reading of a subsample of queries. All transcripts were analyzed by 
at least two members of the study team and intercoder reliability was assessed
using Dedoose software.
FINDINGS: A sample of 19 individuals living with chronic HBV were included within
this study. Themes identified from transcripts noted the significant overlap
between the reported experience of HBV and constructs within the HRQL model. The 
psychological impact of chronic HBV on study participants' HRQL overall was
considerable and contributed to depression, anxiety, homelessness, drug use, and 
incarceration.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis supports the hypothesis that HBV impacts HRQL and often 
negatively affects emotional health. Our findings suggest that it would be
beneficial to include HRQL assessment in the medical management of HBV, so that
interventions can focus on reducing the burden of disease and improving quality
of life for those living with HBV.
