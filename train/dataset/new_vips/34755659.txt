OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of attenuated Herpes simplex virus
1 (HSV-1) vector expressing oncomodulin (OCM) for treatment of mechanical optic
nerve injury in rats.
METHODS: The proliferation characteristics and OCM expression of the recombinant 
HSV-1 vector (1716-OCM) was assessed in cultured Vero cells. Twelve-week-old SD
rats were randomly divided into control group, 1716-OCM injection group and
wild-type virus corneal infection group, and at 7, 14, 30 and 60 days
post-infection (3 rats in each group at each time point), the expressions of OCM 
and HSV-1 structural protein gB in the retina and the hypothalamus of the rats
were detected using immunofluorescence assay. Another 20 rats were randomized
into sham operation group, PBS treatment group, 1716-OCM infection group and
1716-OCM infection with cAMP sensitization group (n=5), and in the latter 3
groups, rat models of optic nerve injury models were established followed by
intravitreal injection of PBS, 1716-OCM or cAMP as indicated. At 45 days after
the treatments, the rats were examined for visual electrophysiological function
using FVEP method, and the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the
expression of myelin basic protein in the optic nerve were detected using
immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: The recombinant 1716-OCM vector was capable of mediating effective
expression of OCM in Vero cells in vitro, but its proliferation rate was much
lower than that of the wild-type virus. In SD rats, the recombinant virus could
mediate the expression of OCM in the RGC layer and choroid layer of the eyes
without inducing significant structural damage of the eyes as compared with the
wild-type virus. In rat models of optic nerve injury, 1716-OCM combined with cAMP
significantly promoted the survival of retinal RGCs (P= 0.007) and inhibited
demyelination of the optic nerve (P=0.03) as compared with the mock treatment.
FVEP analysis showed that 1716-OCM combined with cAMP significantly promoted the 
recovery of the peak amplitude of Î”N1-P1 in the rats (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Attenuated recombinant 1716-OCM vector can mediate OCM expression in 
the retina of rats, and in rat models of mechanical optic nerve injury,
intravitreal injection of 1716-OCM combined with cAMP can effectively alleviate
optic nerve injuries.
