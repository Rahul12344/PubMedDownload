The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Most
SARS-CoV-2 infections are mild or even asymptomatic. However, a small fraction of
infected individuals develops severe, life-threatening disease, which is caused
by an uncontrolled immune response resulting in hyperinflammation. However, the
factors predisposing individuals to severe disease remain poorly understood.
Here, we show that levels of CD47, which is known to mediate immune escape in
cancer and virus-infected cells, are elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco-2
cells, Calu-3 cells, and air-liquid interface cultures of primary human bronchial
epithelial cells. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increases SIRPalpha levels, the 
binding partner of CD47, on primary human monocytes. Systematic literature
searches further indicated that known risk factors such as older age and diabetes
are associated with increased CD47 levels. High CD47 levels contribute to
vascular disease, vasoconstriction, and hypertension, conditions that may
predispose SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to COVID-19-related complications such
as pulmonary hypertension, lung fibrosis, myocardial injury, stroke, and acute
kidney injury. Hence, age-related and virus-induced CD47 expression is a
candidate mechanism potentially contributing to severe COVID-19, as well as a
therapeutic target, which may be addressed by antibodies and small molecules.
Further research will be needed to investigate the potential involvement of CD47 
and SIRPalpha in COVID-19 pathology. Our data should encourage other research
groups to consider the potential relevance of the CD47/ SIRPalpha axis in their
COVID-19 research.
