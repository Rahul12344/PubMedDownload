BACKGROUND: While people who inject drugs (PWID) are vulnerable to the adverse
outcomes of events like COVID-19, little is known regarding the impact of the
current pandemic on PWID. We examine how COVID-19 has affected PWID in New York
City across four domains: substance use, risk behaviors, mental health, and
service utilization.
METHODS: As part of a randomized trial to improve access to HCV treatment for
PWID, we recruited 165 participants. Eligibility criteria included detectable HCV
RNA and recent drug injection. The present cross-sectional analysis is based on a
subsample of 106 participants. We compared responses between two separate
samples: 60 participants interviewed prior to the pandemic (pre-COVID-19 sample) 
and 46 participants interviewed during the pandemic (COVID-19 sample). We also
assessed differences by study group [accessible care (AC) and usual care (UC)].
RESULTS: Compared to the pre-COVID-19 sample, those interviewed during COVID-19
reported higher levels of mental health issues, syringe reuse, and alcohol
consumption and greater reductions in syringe-service programs and buprenorphine 
utilization. In the analysis conducted by study group, the UC group reported
significantly higher injection risk behaviors and lower access to buprenorphine
treatment during COVID-19, while during the same period, the AC group reported
lower levels of substance use and injection risk behaviors.
CONCLUSION: The current study provides insight on how COVID-19 has negatively
affected PWID. Placing dispensing machines of harm-reduction supplies in
communities where PWID live and increasing secondary exchange, mobile services,
and mail delivery of supplies may help maintain access to lifesaving supplies
during big events, such as COVID-19. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov
