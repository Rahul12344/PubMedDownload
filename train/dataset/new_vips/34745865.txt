Because the main modes of transmission of the COVID-19 virus are respiration and 
contact, WHO recommends frequent washing of hands with soap under running water
for at least 20 s. This article investigates how the level of concern about
COVID-19 affects the likelihood of washing hands frequently in sub-Saharan
Africa. We discuss the implication of the findings for water-scarce environment. 
The study makes use of a unique survey dataset from 12 sub-Saharan African
countries collected in April 2020 (first round) and May 2020 (second round) and
employs an extended ordered probit model with endogenous covariate. The results
show that the level of concern about the spread of the virus increases the
likelihood of washing hands with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s
at least five times a day. The increase in the probability of handwashing due to 
concern about COVID-19, ranges from 3% for Benin to 6.3% for South Africa. The
results also show heterogeneous effects across gender- and age-groups, locality
and various water sources. However, in Africa, the sustainability of the
handwashing protocol could be threatened by the severe water scarcity that exists
in the region. To sustain frequent handwashing, sub-Saharan Africa needs an
effective strategy for water management and supply.
