Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne arbovirus that is found widely in
Canada, the Northeastern and Northcentral United States, and the Russian Far
East. While still rare, there has been an increase in reported cases of POWV
disease over the last decade; most (>90%) cases have been neuroinvasive and the
associated fatality rate is high (>10%). Transfusion-associated risk of POWV
remains uncertain; while no intervention is likely indicated, one probable case
of transfusion-transmitted POWV in the context of an increase in the incidence of
POWV and other tick-borne infections, merits vigilance.
