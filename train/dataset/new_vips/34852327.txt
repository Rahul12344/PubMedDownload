Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is routinely collected and analyzed in breath
research. Because it contains aerosol droplets, EBC samples from SARS-CoV-2
infected individuals harbor the virus and pose the threat of infectious exposure.
We report for the first time a safe and consistent method to fully inactivate
SARS-CoV-2 in EBC samples and make EBC samples safe for processing and analysis. 
EBC samples containing infectious SARS-CoV-2 were treated with several
concentrations of acetonitrile. The most commonly used 10% acetonitrile treatment
for EBC processing failed to completely inactivate the virus in samples and
viable virus was detected by the assay of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells
in a BSL-3 laboratory. Treatment with either 50% or 90% acetonitrile was
effective to completely inactivate the virus, resulting in safe, non-infectious
EBC samples that can be used for metabolomic analysis. Our study provides
SARS-CoV-2 inactivation protocol for the collection and processing of EBC samples
in the clinical setting and for advancing to metabolic assessments in health and 
disease.
