BACKGROUND: Rabies, caused by a lyssavirus, is a viral zoonosis that affects
people in many parts of the world, especially those in low income countries.
Contact with domestic animals, especially dogs, is the main source of human
infections. Humans may present with the disease only after a long period of
exposure. Nearly half of rabies cases occur in children <15 years old. We report 
on a fatal case of rabies in a Ghanaian school child 5 years after the exposure
incident, and the vital role of molecular tools in the confirmation of the
diagnosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, an 11-year-old junior high school Ghanaian
student from the Obuasi Municipality in Ghana, presented with aggressive
behavior, which rapidly progressed to confusion and loss of consciousness within 
a day of onset. Her parents reported that the patient had experienced a bite from
a stray dog on her right leg 5 years prior to presentation, for which no
antirabies prophylaxis was given. The patient died within minutes of arrival in
hospital (within 24 hours of symptom onset). Real-time polymerase chain reaction 
testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained after her death confirmed the diagnosis
of rabies. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed the virus to belong to the
Africa 2 lineage of rabies viruses, which is one of the predominant circulating
lineages in Ghana.
CONCLUSION: The incubation period of rabies is highly variable so patients may
only present with symptoms long after the exposure incident. Appropriate
molecular testing tools, when available as part of rabies control programmes, are
vital in confirming cases of rabies.
