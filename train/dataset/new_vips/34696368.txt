BACKGROUND: The prevalence and prognostic implications of metabolic syndrome
(MetS) in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. We performed a
systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 
patients with MetS.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched 
MEDLINE and Scopus to locate every article published up to 1 September 2021,
reporting data on MetS among COVID-19 patients. The pooled prevalence of MetS was
calculated using a random effects model and presented using the related 95%
confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the
Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI.
Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic.
RESULTS: Six studies, enrolling 209.569 COVID-19 patients [mean age 57.2 years,
114.188 males (54.4%)] met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final 
analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 20.5% of cases (95% CI:
6.7-47.8%, p = 0.03), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 98.9%). Pre-existing MetS was
significantly associated with higher risk of short-term mortality (OR: 2.30, 95% 
CI: 1.52-3.45, p < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 89.4%). Meta-regression 
showed a direct correlation with male gender (p = 0.03), hypertension (p <
0.001), DM (p = 0.01) and hyperlipidaemia (p = 0.04), but no effect when
considering age (p = 0.75) and chronic pulmonary disease (p = 0.86) as
moderators.
CONCLUSIONS: MetS represents a major comorbidity in about 20% of COVID-19
patients and it is associated with a 230% increased risk of short-term mortality.
