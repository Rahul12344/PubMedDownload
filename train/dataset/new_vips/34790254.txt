Objective: To uncover the application value of metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS) in the detection of pathogen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) and sputum samples.
Methods: Totally, 32 patients with pulmonary infection were included. Pathogens
in BALF and sputum samples were tested simultaneously by routine microbial
culture and mNGS. Main infected pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and
their distribution in BALF and sputum samples were analyzed. Moreover, the
diagnostic performance of mNGS in paired BALF and sputum samples was assessed.
Results: The pathogen culture results were positive in 9 patients and negative in
13 patients. No statistical differences were recorded on the sensitivity (78.94% 
vs. 63.15%, p = 0.283) and specificity (62.50% vs. 75.00%, p = 0.375) of mNGS
diagnosis in bacteria and fungus in two types of samples. As shown in mNGS
detection, 10 patients' two samples were both positive, 13 patients' two samples 
were both negative, 7 patients were only positive in BALF samples, and 2
patients' sputum samples were positive. Main viruses mNGS detected were EB virus,
human adenovirus 5, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human cytomegalovirus. Kappa
consensus analysis indicated that mNGS showed significant consistency in
detecting pathogens in two samples, no matter bacteria (p < 0.001), fungi (p =
0.026), or viruses (p = 0.008).
Conclusion: mNGS showed no statistical differences in sensitivity and specificity
of pathogen detection in BALF and sputum samples. Under certain conditions,
sputum samples might be more suitable for pathogen detection because of
invasiveness of BALF samples.
