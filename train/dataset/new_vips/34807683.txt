The purpose of this article was to explore how family chaos, parenting processes,
parent-child relationship qualities, and sibling relationship qualities changed
before versus the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included
one parent and two adolescent-aged children from 682 families (2,046
participants). Parents and youth participating in an ongoing longitudinal study
in five Midwestern states in the United States completed an additional web-based 
assessment of family processes and family relationship qualities during the
May-June 2020 pandemic-related shutdowns. A series of two-wave latent change
score models indicated that family chaos increased with the onset of
pandemic-related shutdowns and that the level of chaos within a family during the
shutdowns had implications for changes in several parenting processes and family 
relationship qualities. Specifically, higher levels of family chaos during the
pandemic mitigated observed increases in parental knowledge and were associated
with declines in parental autonomy granting. Family chaos during pandemic-related
shutdowns also was associated with increases in maternal-child conflict,
paternal-child conflict, and sibling conflict as well as decreases in
paternal-child intimacy, sibling intimacy, and sibling disclosure. Overall,
consistent with a family stress perspective, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
was associated with increased strain and commotion within many households, and
these changes had implications for multiple family relationships. (PsycInfo
