Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a class of steroid hormones secreted from the adrenal
cortex. Their production is controlled by circadian rhythm and stress, the latter
of which includes physical restraint, hunger, and inflammation. Importantly, GCs 
have various effects on immunity, metabolism, and cognition, including
pleiotropic effects on the immune system. In general, GCs have strong
anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Indeed, they suppress
inflammatory cytokine expression and cell-mediated immunity, leading to increased
risks of some infections. However, recent studies have shown that endogenous GCs 
induced by the diurnal cycle and dietary restriction enhance immune responses
against some infections by promoting the survival, redistribution, and response
of T and B cells via cytokine and chemokine receptors. Furthermore, although GCs 
are reported to reduce expression of Th2 cytokines, GCs enhance type 2 immunity
and IL-17-associated immunity in some stress conditions. Taken together, GCs have
both immunoenhancing and immunosuppressive effects on the immune system.
