Cellular compartments constituting the tumor microenvironment including immune
cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells
communicate with malignant cells to orchestrate a series of signals that
contribute to the evolution of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we will
focus on the interplay in tumor microenvironment between macrophages and
mesenchymal stem cells and macrophages and fibroblasts. In particular, cell-cell 
interaction and mediators secreted by these cells will be examined to explain
pro/anti-tumor phenotypes induced in macrophages. Nonetheless, in the context of 
virotherapy, the response of macrophages as a consequence of treatment with
oncolytic viruses will be analyzed regarding their polarization status and their 
pro/anti-tumor response.
