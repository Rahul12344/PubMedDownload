Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent threat to public health and global
development; in this scenario, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic has caused a major
disruption of healthcare systems and practices. A narrative review was conducted 
on articles focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on multidrug-resistant
gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. We found that, worldwide,
multiple studies reported an unexpected high incidence of infections due to
methicillin-resistant S. aureus, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii,
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and C. auris among COVID-19 patients
admitted to the intensive care unit. In this setting, inappropriate antimicrobial
exposure, environmental contamination, and discontinuation of infection control
measures may have driven selection and diffusion of drug-resistant pathogens.
