Antigen-specific tissue-resident memory T cells (Trms) and neutralizing IgA
antibodies provide the most effective protection of the lungs from viral
infections. To induce those essential components of lung immunity against
SARS-CoV-2, we tested various immunization protocols involving intranasal
delivery of a novel Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-SARS-2-spike vaccine
candidate. We show that a single intranasal MVA-SARS-CoV-2-S application in mice 
strongly induced pulmonary spike-specific CD8+ T cells, albeit restricted
production of neutralizing antibodies. In prime-boost protocols, intranasal
booster vaccine delivery proved to be crucial for a massive expansion of systemic
and lung tissue-resident spike-specific CD8+ T cells and the development of Th1 -
but not Th2 - CD4+ T cells. Likewise, very high titers of IgG and IgA anti-spike 
antibodies were present in serum and broncho-alveolar lavages that possessed high
virus neutralization capacities to all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
Importantly, the MVA-SARS-2-spike vaccine applied in intramuscular priming and
intranasal boosting treatment regimen completely protected hamsters from
developing SARS-CoV-2 lung infection and pathology. Together, these results
identify intramuscular priming followed by respiratory tract boosting with
MVA-SARS-2-S as a promising approach for the induction of local, respiratory as
well as systemic immune responses suited to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
