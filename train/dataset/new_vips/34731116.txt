ABSTRACT: The occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative effect
on health care systems over the last year. Health care providers were forced to
focus mainly on COVID-19 patients, neglecting in many cases equally important
diseases, both acute and chronic. Therefore, also screening and diagnostic
strategies for HIV could have been significantly impaired.This retrospective,
multicenter, observational study aimed at assessing the number and
characteristics of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and
compared characteristics of people living with HIV at diagnosis between pre- and 
post-COVID-19 era (2019 vs 2020).Our results showed a significant reduction of
HIV diagnoses during pandemic. By contrast, people living with HIV during
pandemic were older and were diagnosed in earlier stage of disease (considering
CD4+ T cell count) compared to those who were diagnosed the year before.
Moreover, there was a significant decrease of new HIV diagnoses among men who
have sex with men, probably for the impact of social distancing and restriction
applied by the Italian Government. Late presentation incidence, if numbers in
2020 were lower than those in 2019, is still an issue.Routinely performing HIV
testing in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is identifying and
linking to care underdiagnosed people living with HIV earlier. Thus, combined
tests (HIV and SARS-CoV-2) should be implemented in patients with SARS-CoV-2
symptoms overlapping HIV's ones. Lastly, our results lastly showed how urgent
implementation of a national policy for HIV screening is necessary.
