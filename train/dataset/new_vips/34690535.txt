Outbreak of infectious diseases imposes a serious threat to human population and 
also causes a catastrophic impact on global economy. Animal coronaviruses remain 
as one of the intriguing problems, known to cause deadly viral diseases on
economically important animal population, and also these infections may spread to
other animals and humans. Through isolation of the infected animals from others
and providing appropriate treatment using antiviral drugs, it is possible to
prevent the virus transmission from animals to other species. In recent times,
antiviral drug-resistant strains are being emerged as a deadly virus which are
known to cause pandemic. To overcome this, nanoparticles-based formulations are
developed as antiviral agent which attacks the animal coronaviruses at multiple
sites in the virus replication cycle. Nanovaccines are also being formulated to
protect the animals from coronaviruses. Nanoformulations contain particles of one
or more dimensions in nano-scale (few nanometers to 1000 nm), which could be
inorganic or organic in nature. This review presents the comprehensive outline of
the nanotechnology-based therapeutics formulated against animal coronaviruses,
which includes the nanoparticles-based antiviral formulations and
nanoparticles-based adjuvant vaccines. The mechanism of action of these
nanoparticles-based antivirals against animal coronavirus is also discussed using
relevant examples. In addition, the scope of repurposing the existing
nano-enabled antivirals and vaccines to combat the coronavirus infections in
animals is elaborated.
