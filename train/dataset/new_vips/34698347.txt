BACKGROUND: Fatty liver disease (FLD) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occur
commonly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). FLD resolution is associated with
improvement in lipoproteins in HIV-uninfected patients. We evaluated changes in
FLD in an HBV/HIV-coinfected cohort.
METHODS: One hundred eight HBV/HIV-coinfected adults with baseline liver biopsies
were followed every 24 weeks (median, 166 weeks) and 60 had follow-up biopsies.
Baseline FLD categories (none, ≥5% steatosis, steatohepatitis), their change, and
relationships with clinical and lipid/lipoprotein parameters were explored using 
multivariable modeling.
RESULTS: Median age was 50 years, and 93% were male. At baseline 30% had FLD.
With control for lipid-lowering medications and body mass index, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C), LDL particle concentration (LDL-P), and
apolipoprotein B (apoB) decreased and adiponectin increased over time (all P <
.05); On follow-up (vs baseline), there was no significant difference in FLD
category (P = .85); 60% remained without FLD, 17% had unchanged, 12% worsening,
and 12% improved FLD. Baseline low-density lipoproteins (LDL-C, LDL-P, small
LDL-P) and apoB appeared highest in those with unchanged FLD status (all P <
.05). No associations between changes in FLD across follow-up
(worsening/improvement vs unchanged) and lipid/lipoproteins changes were
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, there was no significant change in FLD prevalence
over a relatively short timeframe. Baseline atherogenic lipids appeared highest
in those with persistent steatosis or steatohepatitis, suggesting potentially
increased cardiovascular risk in this group, but an independent relationship
between individual-level change in FLD status and lipid/lipoprotein levels across
follow-up was not observed.
