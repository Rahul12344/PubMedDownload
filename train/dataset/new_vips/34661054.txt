Background: Multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a systemic 
inflammatory condition where various body organs, such as the heart, kidney,
gastrointestinal organs, become inflamed. Several cases have been reported in
children linking MIS-C with novel corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19); however, 
few cases have been reported in adults [multi-system inflammatory syndrome in
adults (MIS-A)].
Case summary: A case of a 20-year-old male patient with a history of COVID-19
infection 2 months before presentation who presented with fever and acute right
lower quadrant pain. Workup revealed right-sided mesenteric lymphadenopathy and
mild colitis that was non-responsive to antibiotics. The patient was found to
have significantly elevated inflammatory markers. He also developed myocarditis
resulting in acute systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The
diagnosis of MIS-A was made by exclusion. The patient showed improvement with
intravenous immunoglobulin and pulse steroids. Based on the available literature,
MIS-C was defined till the age of 21; however, we think it is a misnomer for
adults more than 18. Hence, we prefer to use MIS-A for our patient.
Conclusion: It is essential to diagnose and treat patients with the multi-system 
inflammatory syndrome at an early stage; the management of these patients,
especially with heart disease, should include immune-modulatory therapy as well
as guideline-directed therapy.
