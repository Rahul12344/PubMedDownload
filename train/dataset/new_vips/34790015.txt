BACKGROUND: Quantitative hepatitis B core-related antigen (qHBcrAg) has a better 
correlation with intrahepatic hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular 
DNA (cccDNA) than HBV DNA or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), but data are still
lacking for its clinical application.
AIM: The aim was to investigate serum qHBcrAg levels in patients with chronic
hepatitis B and assess the correlation of serum qHBcrAg with pregenomic RNA
(pgRNA), cccDNA, and HBeAg seroconversion.
METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of patients who underwent
percutaneous liver biopsy between July 2014 and June 2019 in two multicenter
randomized controlled clinical trials of peginterferon vs nucleos(t)ide analog
(NUC)-based therapy (NCT03509688 and NCT03546530). Serum qHBcrAg, pgRNA, HBV DNA,
hepatitis B core antigen, HBeAg, liver cccDNA, and HBV DNA were measured. The
correlations of serum qHBcrAg with other biomarkers were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 139 patients were included. The mean qHBcrAg levels were 5.32
± 1.18 log10 U/mL at baseline and decreased during treatment (all P < 0.0001).
Serum qHBcrAg levels were positively correlated with pgRNA (r = 0.597, P <
0.0001) and cccDNA (r = 0.527, P < 0.0001) levels. The correlation of serum
qHBcrAg level and intrahepatic HBV DNA levels at baseline was weak but
significant (r = 0.399, P < 0.0001). HBcrAg predicted HBeAg seroconversion, with 
areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.788 at 24 wk and
0.825 at 48 wk. Log HBcrAg at wk 24 and 48 was independently associated with
HBeAg seroconversion [odds ratio (OR) = 2.402, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.314-4.391, P = 0.004; OR = 3.587, 95%CI: 1.315-9.784, P = 0.013].
CONCLUSION: Serum HBcrAg levels were correlated with HBV virological markers and 
could be used to predict HBeAg seroconversion.
