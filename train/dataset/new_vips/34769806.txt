Despite its severe adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis, clozapine is the
primary treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The established
clozapine monitoring system has contributed to reducing agranulocytosis incidence
and mortality rates. However, the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
has caused changes in the monitoring system. This review aimed to assess the
current evidence on the neutrophil changes in the patient on clozapine treatment 
and infected with COVID-19. Individual cases reported various absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) levels, normal, reduced, or elevated. No agranulocytosis case was
reported. One case had a borderline moderate-severe ANC level, but the patient
was in the 18-week period of clozapine treatment. A cumulative analysis of case
the series initially reported inconclusive results. However, a more recent study 
with a larger sample size reported a significant reduction in the ANC during
COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, this effect is transient as no significant
difference was found between the baseline and the post-infection period in ANC
levels. In conclusion, COVID-19 is associated with a temporary reduction in ANC
levels. The results supported the recommendation to reduce the frequency of
clozapine monitoring in the eligible candidates. However, more data are required 
to confirm the current findings given the limitations, including study design,
sample size, and statistical analysis.
