The MMR vaccination program was introduced in Spain in 1981. Consistently high
vaccination coverage has led to Spain being declared free of endemic measles
transmission since 2014. A few imported and import-related cases were reported
during the post-elimination phase (2014 to 2020), with very low incidence: three 
cases per million of inhabitants a year, 70% in adults. In the post-elimination
phase an increasing proportion of measles appeared in two-dose vaccinated
individuals (up to 14%), posing a challenge to surveillance and laboratory
investigations. Severity and clinical presentation were milder among the
vaccinated. The IgM response varied and the viral load decreased, making the
virus more difficult to detect. A valid set of samples (serum, urine and throat
swab) is strongly recommended for accurate case classification. One third of
measles in fully vaccinated people was contracted in healthcare settings, mainly 
in doctors and nurses, consistent with the important role of high intensity
exposure in measles breakthrough cases. Surveillance protocols and laboratory
algorithms should be adapted in advanced elimination settings. Reinforcing the
immunity of people working in high exposure environments, such as healthcare
settings, and implementing additional infection control measures, such as masking
and social distancing, are becoming crucial for the global aim of measles
eradication.
