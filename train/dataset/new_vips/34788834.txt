BACKGROUND: Studies presenting the SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate (IFR) for
healthy individuals are warranted. Here we estimate the IFR by age and
comorbidity status using data from a large serosurvey among Danish blood donors
and nationwide data on COVID-19 mortality.
METHODS: Danish blood donors aged 17 to 69 years donating blood between October
2020 and February 2021 were tested with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody
assay. IFR was estimated for weeks 11 to 42, 2020 and for week 43, 2020 to week
6, 2021, representing the first two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark.
RESULTS: In total, 84,944 blood donors were tested for antibodies. The
seroprevalence was 2% in October 2020 and 7% in February 2021. Among 3,898,039
Danish residents aged 17 to 69 years, 249 deaths were recorded. The IFR was low
for people younger than 51 years without comorbidity during the two waves
(combined IFR = 3.36 per 100,000 infections). The IFR was below 3‰ for people
aged 61 to 69 years without comorbidity. IFR increased with age and comorbidity
but declined from the first to the second wave.
CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, the IFR was very low among people younger 
than 51 years without comorbidity.
