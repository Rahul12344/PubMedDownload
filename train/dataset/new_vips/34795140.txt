A 73 years old male patient with the past history of kidney transplantation was
admitted to our hospital for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pneumonia. On the 25th day after the onset of symptoms when his condition was
improving, he suddenly developed pneumothorax. Chest tube drainage was performed 
and connected the tube to the drainage device using a high efficiency particulate
air (HEPA) filter. Because of the improvement of infection, the HEPA filter was
removed from the drainage device on day 28. Chest tube drainage was continued by 
day 35, and he was discharged and introduced home oxygen therapy on day 51.
