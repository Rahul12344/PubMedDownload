Background: The gradual opening of healthcare system since second week of May
2020 following lockdown imposed due to corona virus pandemic saw spurts of cases 
of unexplained central facial dermatoses in subset of previously healthy people. 
The aim of the study was to find out the cause and establish the definitive
diagnosis of unusual occurrence of facial dermatoses on previously healthy people
so that an appropriate management can be offered to the patients.
Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional, observational study carried
during May 15 to July 15, 2020 at a tertiary dermatology center. All cases
presented with erythema on face and papular or pustular lesions on central facial
area of not more than 2 months of duration were included in the study.
Results: Total 81 patients visited skin OPD with facial dermatoses of various
types during this period, out of which 21 patients fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. This was 0.72% (21/2900) of total skin OPD of the 2 months. All the
patients had been using face masks during this period of symptoms due to the
ongoing coronavirus situation. Dermatological examination revealed only erythema 
on the central area of face (n = 10), erythema and few papules (n = 3),
erythmatous papules and pustules (n = 5), and erythematous papules, pustules, and
telengiectasia (n = 3). All the skin biopsies showed predominantly epithelioid
cells, noncaseating granuloma with a variable degree of infiltrate.
Conclusion: There has been a definite change in the lifestyle due to the current 
Covid-19 pandemic. People are compulsorily using face masks to avoid the spread
of Covid-19 infection. This change in behavior has brought out a surge of rosacea
like lesions on the covered area of face. Partly, it can be explained by change
in innate immunity due to excessive sweating and change in microenvironment of
skin.
