Virus-induced neurological sequelae resulting from infection by Theiler's murine 
encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) are used for studying human conditions ranging
from epileptic seizures to demyelinating disease. Mouse strains are typically
considered susceptible or resistant to TMEV infection based on viral persistence 
and extreme phenotypes, such as demyelination. We have identified a broader
spectrum of phenotypic outcomes by infecting strains of the genetically diverse
Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource. We evaluated the chronic-infection gene 
expression profiles of hippocampi and thoracic spinal cords for 19 CC strains in 
relation to phenotypic severity and TMEV persistence. Strains were clustered
based on similar phenotypic profiles and TMEV levels at 90 days post-infection,
and we categorized distinct TMEV response profiles. The three most common
profiles included "resistant" and "susceptible," as before, as well as a
"resilient" TMEV response group which experienced both TMEV persistence and mild 
neurological phenotypes even at 90 days post-infection. Each profile had a
distinct gene expression signature, allowing the identification of pathways and
networks specific to each TMEV response group. CC founder haplotypes for genes
involved in these pathways/networks revealed candidate response-specific alleles.
These alleles demonstrated pleiotropy and epigenetic (miRNA) regulation in
long-term TMEV infection, with particular relevance for resilient mouse strains.
