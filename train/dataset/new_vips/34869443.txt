Background: Testing of possibly infected individuals remains cornerstone of
containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Detection dogs could contribute to mass
screening. Previous research demonstrated canines' ability to detect
SARS-CoV-2-infections but has not investigated if dogs can differentiate between 
COVID-19 and other virus infections. Methods: Twelve dogs were trained to detect 
SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Three test scenarios were performed to evaluate
their ability to discriminate SARS-CoV-2-infections from viral infections of a
different aetiology. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples from individuals and
samples from cell culture both infected with one of 15 viruses that may cause
COVID-19-like symptoms were presented as distractors in a randomised,
double-blind study. Dogs were either trained with SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva
samples (test scenario I and II) or with supernatant from cell cultures (test
scenario III). Results: When using swab samples from individuals infected with
viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 as distractors (test scenario I), dogs detected
swab samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with a mean diagnostic
sensitivity of 73.8% (95% CI: 66.0-81.7%) and a specificity of 95.1% (95% CI:
92.6-97.7%). In test scenario II and III cell culture supernatant from cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2, cells infected with other coronaviruses and
non-infected cells were presented. Dogs achieved mean diagnostic sensitivities of
61.2% (95% CI: 50.7-71.6%, test scenario II) and 75.8% (95% CI: 53.0-98.5%, test 
scenario III), respectively. The diagnostic specificities were 90.9% (95% CI:
87.3-94.6%, test scenario II) and 90.2% (95% CI: 81.1-99.4%, test scenario III), 
respectively. Conclusion: In all three test scenarios the mean specificities were
above 90% which indicates that dogs can distinguish SARS-CoV-2-infections from
other viral infections. However, compared to earlier studies our scent dogs
achieved lower diagnostic sensitivities. To deploy COVID-19 detection dogs as a
reliable screening method it is therefore mandatory to include a variety of
samples from different viral respiratory tract infections in dog training to
ensure a successful discrimination process.
