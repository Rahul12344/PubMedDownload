Pneumonia is a common but serious infectious disease, and is the sixth leading
cause for death. The foreign pathogens such as viruses, fungi, and bacteria
establish an inflammation response after interaction with lung, leading to the
filling of bronchioles and alveoli with fluids. Although the pharmacotherapies
have shown their great effectiveness to combat pathogens, advanced methods are
under developing to treat complicated cases such as virus-infection and lung
inflammation or acute lung injury (ALI). The inflammation modulation
nanoparticles (NPs) can effectively suppress immune cells and inhibit
inflammatory molecules in the lung site, and thereby alleviate pneumonia and ALI.
In this review, the pathological inflammatory microenvironments in pneumonia,
which are instructive for the design of biomaterials therapy, are summarized. The
focus is then paid to the inflammation-modulating NPs that modulate the
inflammatory cells, cytokines and chemokines, and microenvironments of pneumonia 
for better therapeutic effects. This article is categorized under: Therapeutic
Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Respiratory Disease.
