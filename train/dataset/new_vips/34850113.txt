Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) is a histone methyltransferase. Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a leading cause of malignancy in AIDS.
KSHV latently infects tumor cells and its genome is decorated with epigenetic
marks. Here, we show that KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) recruits
MLL1 to viral DNA where it establishes H3K4me3 modifications at the extensive
KSHV terminal repeat elements during primary infection. LANA interacts with MLL1 
complex members, including WDR5, integrates into the MLL1 complex, and regulates 
MLL1 activity. We describe the 1.5-Å crystal structure of N-terminal LANA peptide
complexed with MLL1 complex member WDR5, which reveals a potential regulatory
mechanism. Disruption of MLL1 expression rendered KSHV latency establishment
highly deficient. This deficiency was rescued by MLL1 but not by catalytically
inactive MLL1. Therefore, MLL1 is LANA regulable and exerts a central role in
virus infection. These results suggest broad potential for MLL1 regulation,
including by non-host factors.
