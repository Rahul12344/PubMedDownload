The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Canada's long-term care
(LTC) sector, with residents of LTC and retirement homes accounting for 67% of
all COVID-19-related deaths as of February 15, 2021. This study investigated the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LTC residents across Canada during the first
six months of the pandemic, including how care changed for residents, using data 
from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's LTC and acute care
databases. The results suggest that LTC residents received less medical care,
with fewer physician visits and hospital transfers compared with the same period 
in 2019. They also had less contact with family/friends compared with the same
period in 2019, which was associated with higher levels of depression. In
provinces where it could be measured, the number of LTC resident deaths from all 
causes was higher than pre-pandemic years during the peak of the first wave, even
in jurisdictions with few COVID-19-related deaths in LTC.
