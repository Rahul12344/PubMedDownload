Vaccines that are shelf stable and easy to administer are crucial to improve
vaccine access and reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the world. Here we
demonstrate that an oral, adenovirus-based vaccine candidate protects against
SARS-CoV-2 in a Syrian hamster challenge model. Hamsters administered two doses
of VXA-CoV2-1 showed a reduction in weight loss and lung pathology and had
completely eliminated infectious virus 5 days post challenge. Oral immunization
induced anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies were induced upon oral
immunization with the sera demonstrating neutralizing activity. Overall this data
demonstrates the ability of oral vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1 to provide
protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease.
