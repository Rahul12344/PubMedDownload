In 2019, the World Health Organization declared 3 billion to be at risk of
developing Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF). The causative agent of this
deadly infection is CCHFV. The data related to the biology and immunology of
CCHFV are rather scarce. Due to its indispensable roles in the viral life cycle, 
NP becomes a logical target for detailed viral immunology studies. In this study,
humoral immunity to NP was investigated in CCHF survivors, as well as in
immunized mice and rabbits. Abundant antibody response against NP was
demonstrated both during natural infection in humans and following experimental
immunizations in mice and rabbits. Also, cellular immune responses to recombinant
NP (rNP) was detected in multispecies. This study represents the most
comprehensive investigation on NP as an inducer of both humoral and cellular
immunity in multiple hosts and proves that rNP is an excellent candidate
warranting further immunological studies specifically on vaccine investigations.
