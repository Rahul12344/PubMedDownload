BACKGROUND: During the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in China, most medical
undergraduate programs have to eventually embrace the maneuver of transferring to
nearly 100% online-learning as a new routine for different curricula. And there
is a lack of empirical evidence of effective medical education curriculum that
has been completely implemented in an online format. This study summarizes
medical students' perspectives regarding online-learning experience during the
COVID-19 outbreak and presents reflection on medical education.
METHODS: From February 21st to March 14th, 2020, the authors conducted survey of 
a nationally representative sample of undergraduate medical students from 90
medical schools in China. Participant demographics and responses were tabulated, 
and independent sample t-tests as well as multiple logistic regression models
were used to assess the associations of demographic characteristics, prior online
learning experience, and orientation with students' perspectives on the online
learning experience.
RESULTS: Among 118,030 medical students participated in the survey (response rate
52.4%), 99,559 provided valid data for the analysis. The sample is fairly
nationally representative. 65.7% (65,389/99,559) supported great orientation and 
62.1% (61,818/99,559) reported that they were satisfied with the ongoing
online-learning experience. The most common problem students would encounter was 
the network congestion (76,277/99,559; 76.6%). Demographics, learning phases, and
academic performance were associated with online-learning engagement and
perceptions. Formal orientation and prior PU (perceived usefulness of online
learning) were significantly positively associated with the satisfaction and
evaluation of the online learning experience (p <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this national survey indicates a relatively positive role 
of online learning as a formal teaching/learning approach in medical education.
Considerations should be made regarding such application in aspects of students' 
different learning phases. We suggest that further policy interventions should be
taken from technological, organizational, environmental, as well as individual
aspects, to help improve the outcome of online learning for future doctors.
