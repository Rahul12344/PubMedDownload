Monocytes are rapidly recruited to inflamed tissues where they differentiate into
monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-mac) or dendritic cells (mo-DC). At infection
sites, monocytes encounter a broad range of microbial motifs. How pathogen
recognition impacts monocyte fate decision is unclear. Here, we show, using an in
vitro model allowing the simultaneous differentiation of human mo-mac and mo-DC, 
that viruses promote mo-mac while Mycobacteria favor mo-DC differentiation.
Mechanistically, we found that pathogen sensing through toll-like receptor (TLR) 
ligands increases mo-mac differentiation via mTORC1. By contrast,
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) ligands favor mo-DC through the
induction of TNF-α secretion and miR-155 expression. We confirmed these results
in vivo, in mouse skin and by analyzing transcriptomic data from human
individuals. Overall, our findings allow a better understanding of the molecular 
control of monocyte differentiation and of monocyte plasticity upon pathogen
sensing.
