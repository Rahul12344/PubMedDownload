The introduction of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is expected to prevent 
COVID-19. However, sporadic cases of infection in vaccinated persons have been
reported. We describe a case of a double-dose vaccinated woman with COVID-19. All
stages of infection were observed, from no identification of virus, then the
start of the infection, a high viral load, coming out of viraemia, and finally no
detection of the virus. Despite the high viral load, the woman demonstrated mild 
COVID-19 symptoms, manifested only by a sore throat. The antibody results showed 
that she produced both post-infectious and post-vaccination immune responses.
Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained viral genome sequence indicated that the
virus belonged to the UK SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (GR 501Y.V1; 20I/S:501Y.V1;
Alpha variant).
