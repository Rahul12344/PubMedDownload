The antimicrobial medication malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) is used as a
fixed-dose combination for treating children and adults with uncomplicated
malaria or as chemoprophylaxis for preventing malaria in travelers. It is an
inexpensive, efficacious, and safe drug frequently prescribed around the world.
Following anecdotal evidence from 17 patients in the provinces of Quebec and
Ontario, Canada, suggesting that malarone/atovaquone may present some benefits in
protecting against COVID-19, we sought to examine its antiviral potential in
limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cellular models of infection. In VeroE6
expressing human TMPRSS2 and human lung Calu-3 epithelial cells, we show that the
active compound atovaquone at micromolar concentrations potently inhibits the
replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern including the alpha,
beta, and delta variants. Importantly, atovaquone retained its full antiviral
activity in a primary human airway epithelium cell culture model.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the atovaquone antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 is partially dependent on the expression of TMPRSS2 and that the drug 
can disrupt the interaction of the spike protein with the viral receptor, ACE2.
Additionally, spike-mediated membrane fusion was also reduced in the presence of 
atovaquone. In the United States, two clinical trials of atovaquone administered 
alone or in combination with azithromycin were initiated in 2020. While we await 
the results of these trials, our findings in cellular infection models
demonstrate that atovaquone is a potent antiviral FDA-approved drug against
SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern in vitro.
