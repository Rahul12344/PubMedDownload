This article discusses drastic changes in the practice of end-of-life care during
the COVID-19 pandemic. It reviews the ethical dilemmas of individual autonomy
versus societal justice, human beneficence versus public health non-maleficence
that arose during the pandemic due to prolonged, high acutity,= critical illness 
in the setting of a highly contageous respiratory virus, protective personal
equipment shortages,m crisis standards of care to distribute scarce medical
resources, and changes in interactions between treating clinicians, patients, and
visitors. The lessons learned during the pandemic response will directly inform
and impact the appraoch to future pandemic events.
