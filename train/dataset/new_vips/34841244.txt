We aimed to estimate, albeit crudely and provisionally, national, regional, and
global proportions of respective populations that have been infected with
SARS-CoV-2 in the first year after the introduction of this virus into human
circulation, and to assess infection morbidity and mortality rates, factoring
both documented and undocumented infections. The estimates were generated by
applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The percentage of 
the world's population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was
estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). It was lowest in the Western Pacific 
Region at 0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%) and highest in the Americas at 41.92% (95%
CI: 37.95-46.09%). The global infection fatality rate was 10.73 (95% CI:
10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections. Globally per 1000 infections, the infection
acute-care bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95% CI: 18.73-19.51), the
infection ICU bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18). If left
unchecked with no vaccination and no other public health interventions, and
assuming circulation of only wild-type variants and no variants of concern, the
pandemic would eventually cause 8.18 million deaths (95% CI: 7.30-9.18), 163.67
million acute-care hospitalizations (95% CI: 148.12-179.51), and 33.01 million
ICU hospitalizations (95% CI: 30.52-35.70), by the time the herd immunity
threshold is reached at 60-70% infection exposure. The global population remained
far below the herd immunity threshold by end of 2020. Global epidemiology reveals
immense regional variation in infection exposure and morbidity and mortality
rates.
