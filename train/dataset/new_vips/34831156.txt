BACKGROUND/AIM: The recovery pattern of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated
metabolic alteration after sustained virological response (SVR) following
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) remains elusive.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of chronic HCV-infected (CHC) patients (n =
415) receiving DAAs (n = 365) was conducted. Metabolic profiles were examined in 
SVR patients (n = 360) every 3-6 months after therapy and compared with those of 
sex- and age-matched controls (n = 470).
RESULTS: At baseline, of 415, 168 (40.5%) had insulin resistance (IR). The
following were associated: levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), HCV RNA, fibrosis-4 score, and
interferon-Î»3-rs12979860 genotype with total cholesterol (TC) levels; and TG
levels and BMI with HOMA-IR. Over a 3-year follow-up, in SVR patients, BMI and TC
levels and TG/HDL-C ratios increased from baseline, while HOMA-IR trended
downward by 72 weeks after therapy and then increased. The increased HDL-C levels
began to decrease after 72 weeks after therapy. TC and HOMA-IR were negatively
associated with each other until 24 weeks after therapy. Earlier increases in BMI
and decreases in HOMA-IR were noted in SVR patients with than in those without
baseline IR. Compared with controls, in the subgroup without baseline IR, SVR
patients had increased BMI and HOMA-IR levels. Metabolic profiles were similar
between SVR patients and controls in the subgroup with baseline IR.
CONCLUSIONS: In SVR patients treated with DAAs, the recovery of altered lipid and
glucose metabolism was not coupled until 72-week post-therapy, when HOMA-IR
reached its nadir. SVR patients with baseline IR recovered from HCV-associated
metabolic alterations earlier than those without baseline IR.
