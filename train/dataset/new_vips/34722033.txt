OBJECTIVE: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is urgently sought during public
health crises. It is necessary for the safety of both the patient and the
healthcare professional. Yet during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, PPE scarcity in
many countries, including the United States, has impacted the level of care for
patients and the safety of healthcare personnel. Additionally, the implementation
of mandatory mask mandates for the general public in many countries forced
individuals to either reuse PPE, which can contribute to poor hygiene, or buy PPE
in bulk and thereby contribute to the scarcity of PPE. In this study, we
investigate the possibility of using a cost-effective ozone sterilization unit on
contaminated N95 masks as an alternative to current sterilization methods.
METHOD: This protocol examined ozone's ability to decontaminate N95 mask fabric
that was exposed to a surrogate virus (Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2). Once 
the sterilization unit achieves an ozone concentration of ~30 ppm, a 60-minute or
120-minute sterilization cycle commences. Following the sterilization cycle, we
investigated the amount of viable virus on the slide using a viral plaque assay
and compared it to a non-sterilized, control slide. Furthermore, we carried out
trials to investigate the safety of an ozone sterilization device, by measuring
the levels of ozone exposure that individuals may experience when operating the
sterilization unit post-cycle.
RESULTS: We showed that a 120-minute sterilization cycle at ~30 ppm achieves a
3-log reduction in viral activity, thereby complying with industry and U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Further, we demonstrated that when
following our protocol, the ozone exposure levels for a simple sterilization unit
to be used at home complied with federal and industry standards.
CONCLUSION: Ozone may have the potential to decontaminate masks and other PPE.
