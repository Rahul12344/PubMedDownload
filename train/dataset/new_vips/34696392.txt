Bats have been identified as natural reservoirs of a variety of coronaviruses.
They harbor at least 19 of the 33 defined species of alpha- and
betacoronaviruses. Previously, the bat coronavirus HKU10 was found in two bat
species of different suborders, Rousettus leschenaultia and Hipposideros pomona, 
in south China. However, its geographic distribution and evolution history are
not fully investigated. Here, we screened this viral species by a nested reverse 
transcriptase PCR in our archived samples collected over 10 years from 25
provinces of China and one province of Laos. From 8004 bat fecal samples, 26 were
found to be positive for bat coronavirus HKU10 (BtCoV HKU10). New habitats of
BtCoV HKU10 were found in the Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hainan Provinces of China, and
Louang Namtha Province in Laos. In addition to H. pomona, BtCoV HKU10 variants
were found circulating in Aselliscus stoliczkanus and Hipposideros larvatus. We
sequenced full-length genomes of 17 newly discovered BtCoV HKU10 strains and
compared them with previously published sequences. Our results revealed a much
higher genetic diversity of BtCoV HKU10, particularly in spike genes and
accessory genes. Besides the two previously reported lineages, we found six novel
lineages in their new habitats, three of which were located in Yunnan province.
The genotypes of these viruses are closely related to sampling locations based on
polyproteins, and correlated to bat species based on spike genes. Combining
phylogenetic analysis, selective pressure, and molecular-clock calculation, we
demonstrated that Yunnan bats harbor a gene pool of BtCoV HKU10, with H. pomona
as a natural reservoir. The cell tropism test using spike-pseudotyped lentivirus 
system showed that BtCoV HKU10 could enter cells from human and bat, suggesting a
potential interspecies spillover. Continuous studies on these bat coronaviruses
will expand our understanding of the evolution and genetic diversity of
coronaviruses, and provide a prewarning of potential zoonotic diseases from bats.
