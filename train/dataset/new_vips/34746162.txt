Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease caused by a
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has no
specific and effective treatment. The pathophysiological process of the COVID-19 
is an excessive inflammatory response after an organism infects with a virus.
Inflammatory storms play an important role in the development of the COVID-19. A 
large number of studies have confirmed that hydrogen has a therapeutic effect on 
many diseases via inhibiting excessive inflammatory cells and factors. Recently, 
a study led by the Academician Zhong Nanshan in China on the treatment of the
patients with the COVID-19 by inhalation of a mixed gas composed of hydrogen and 
oxygen has attracted widespread international attention and hydrogen therapy has 
also been included in a new treatment plan for the COVID-19 in China. This study 
mainly describes the mechanism of occurrence of the COVID-19, summarizes the
therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of hydrogen on the critical
disease, and analyzes the feasibility and potential therapeutic targets of
hydrogen for the treatment of the COVID-19.
