The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare organizations globally,
particularly from a supply chain perspective. Leaders with successful responses
have drawn upon their toolkit to anticipate threats, recognize crises, respond
decisively, visibly engage in problem solving and facilitate communication. By
harnessing these skills, leaders have tackled COVID-19-related challenges,
including panic buying, organizational goal misalignment, staff anxiety and
criticism. By applying crisis management theory and presenting learnings from
interviews with American and Canadian healthcare leaders, we present solutions
and lessons learned, including implementing communication methods, building staff
resiliency, reducing staff anxiety and leading virtually.
