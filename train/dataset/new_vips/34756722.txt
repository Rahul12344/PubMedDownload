INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This report describes the cardiac pacing activity
performed in Spain in 2020, including the number and type of implanted devices,
demographic and clinical factors, and data on remote monitoring.
METHODS: Information consisted of the European Pacemaker Patient Card, data
submitted to the cardiodispositivos.es online platform, the databases of
participating centers, and supplier-reported data.
RESULTS: A total of 14 662 procedures were registered from 102 hospitals,
representing 39.2% of the estimated activity. The implantation rates of
conventional and low-energy resynchronization pacemakers were 759 and 31 units
per million population, respectively. In all, 520 leadless pacemakers were
implanted, 70 with atrioventricular synchrony. The mean age at implantation was
high (78.8 years), and the most frequent electrocardiographic change was
atrioventricular block. There was a predominance of dual-chamber pacing mode but 
VVI/R single-chamber pacing was used in 19% of patients in sinus rhythm,
depending on age and sex. Remote monitoring capability was present in 18.5% of
implanted conventional pacemakers and 45.6% of low-energy resynchronization
pacemakers, although registration in this system increased by 53% in 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the number of
implanted conventional pacemakers decreased by 8% and cardiac resynchronization
therapy by 4.6%. The number of leadless pacemakers increased by 16.5%. Sequential
pacing was predominant, influenced by age and sex. Home monitoring played a
fundamental role as a mode of follow-up in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic year.
