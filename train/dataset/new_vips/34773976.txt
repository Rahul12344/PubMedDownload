BACKGROUND: This study aims to characterize SARS-CoV-2 mutations which are
primarily prevalent in the Cypriot population. Moreover, using computational
approaches, we assess whether these mutations are associated with changes in
viral virulence.
METHODS: We utilize genetic data from 144 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains from
the Cypriot population obtained between March 2020 and January 2021, as well as
all data available from GISAID. We combine this with countries' regional
information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related
public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective 
advantage of Cyprus-specific mutations are obtained by mutation tracking
analysis. This entails calculating specific mutation frequencies within the
Cypriot population and comparing these with their prevalence world-wide
throughout the course of the pandemic. We further make use of linear regression
models to extrapolate additional information that may be missed through standard 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: We report a single mutation found in the ORF1ab gene (nucleotide
position 18,440) that appears to be significantly enriched within the Cypriot
population. The amino acid change is denoted as S6059F, which maps to the
SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 protein. We further analyse this mutation using regression
models to investigate possible associations with increased deaths and cases per
million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutation
infers a conformational change to the protein that significantly alters its
structure when compared to the reference protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Investigating Cyprus-specific mutations for SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a
better understanding of viral pathogenicity. Researching these mutations can
generate potential links between viral-specific mutations and the unique genomics
of the Cypriot population. This can not only lead to important findings from
which to battle the pandemic on a national level, but also provide insights into 
viral virulence worldwide.
