BACKGROUND: We investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV on patients' lung
and immune systems 15 years post-infection. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is ongoing
however, another genetically related beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV caused an epidemic
in 2003-2004.
METHODS: We enrolled 58 healthcare workers from Peking University People's
Hospital who were infected with SARS-CoV in 2003. We evaluated lung damage by
mMRC score, pulmonary function tests, and chest CT. Immune function was assessed 
by their serum levels of globin, complete components, and peripheral T cell
subsets. ELISA was used to detect SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies in sera.
RESULTS: After 15 years of disease onset, 19 (36.5%), 8 (34.6%), and 19 (36.5%)
subjects had impaired DL (CO), RV, and FEF25-75, respectively. 17 (30.4%)
subjects had an mMRC score ≥ 2. Fourteen (25.5%) cases had residual CT
abnormalities. T regulatory cells were a bit higher in the SARS survivors. IgG
antibodies against SARS S-RBD protein and N protein were detected in 11 (18.97%) 
and 12 (20.69%) subjects, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that small
airway dysfunction and CT abnormalities were more common in the severe group than
in the non-severe group (57.1% vs 22.6%, 54.5% vs 6.1%, respectively, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV could cause permanent damage to the lung, which requires
early pulmonary rehabilitation. The long-lived immune memory response against
coronavirus requires further studies to assess the potential benefit. Trial
registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03443102. Registered prospectively on 25
January 2018.
