BACKGROUND: During March of 2020 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) announced non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) guidance as the primary
mitigation strategy against growing COVID-19 community spread due to the absence 
of a vaccine or effective treatment at that time. CDC guidance states that NPIs
are most effective when instituted in an early, targeted, and layered fashion.
NPIs are effective in slowing spread, and measures should be custom-tailored to
each population. This study examines factors associated with implementation and
timing of NPI interventions across large public and private U.S. universities at 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: NPI decisions of interest include when U.S. universities canceled
international travel, shifted to online learning, moved faculty/staff to remote
work, limited campus housing, and closed campus for all non-essential personnel. 
Cox proportional hazard analyses of retrospective data were conducted to assess
the time to NPI events. Hazard ratios were calculated for university governance, 
campus setting, religious affiliation, health infrastructure, faculty diversity, 
and student demographics. The methods control for variance inflation factors,
COVID case prevalence, and time varying covariates of spring break and states'
state of emergency (SOE) orders. This study captures NPI decisions at 575 U.S.
universities during spring of 2020 which affected the movement of seven million
students and two million employees.
RESULTS: Universities located in districts represented by Democratic party
congressional members reported earlier NPI implementation than Republican (Cox
proportional hazard ratio (HR) range 0.61-0.80). University religious affiliation
was not associated with the timing any of the NPI decisions. Universities with
more diverse faculty showed an association with earlier NPI implementation (HR
range 0.65-0.76). The existence of university-affiliated health infrastructure
was not associated with NPI timing.
CONCLUSION: University NPI implementation was largely driven by local COVID-19
epidemiology, culture and political concerns. The timing of university NPI
decisions varied by regional politics, faculty demographics, university
governance, campus setting, and foreign student prevalence adjusting for COVID-19
state case prevalence and spring break timing. Religious affiliation and presence
of university health infrastructure were not associated with timing.
