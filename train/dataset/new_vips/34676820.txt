BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic urges for cheap, reliable, and rapid
technologies for disinfection and decontamination. One frequently proposed method
is ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation. UV-C doses necessary to achieve inactivation
of high-titre SARS-CoV-2 are poorly defined.
AIM: We investigated whether short exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to UV-C irradiation
sufficiently reduces viral infectivity and doses necessary to achieve an at least
6-log reduction in viral titres.
METHODS: Using a box and two handheld systems designed to decontaminate objects
and surfaces, we evaluated the efficacy of 254 nm UV-C treatment to inactivate
surface dried high-titre SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: Drying for 2 hours did not have a major impact on the infectivity of
SARS-CoV-2, indicating that exhaled virus in droplets or aerosols stays
infectious on surfaces for at least a certain amount of time. Short exposure of
high titre surface dried virus (3-5*10^6 IU/ml) with UV-C light (16 mJ/cm2)
resulted in a total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Dose-dependency experiments
revealed that 3.5 mJ/cm2 were still effective to achieve a > 6-log reduction in
viral titres, whereas 1.75 mJ/cm2 lowered infectivity only by one order of
magnitude.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by relatively low doses of UV-C
irradiation and the relationship between UV-C dose and log-viral titre reduction 
of surface residing SARS-CoV-2 is nonlinear. Our findings emphasize that it is
necessary to assure sufficient and complete exposure of all relevant areas by
integrated UV-C doses of at least 3.5 mJ/cm2 at 254 nm. Altogether, UV-C
treatment is an effective non-chemical option to decontaminate surfaces from
high-titre infectious SARS-CoV-2.
