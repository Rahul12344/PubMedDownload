OBJECTIVE: The clinical outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and its
sequelae including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are greatly
affected by host genetic factors; however, the possible mechanisms are still
largely unclear. This work aimed to assess transforming growth factor-β1
(TGF-β1), and patatin-like phospholipase domain containing-protein 3 (PNPLA3)
genetic variants as risk factors for hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in Egyptian patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: Seventy HCV-related liver cirrhosis patients (Total cirrhosis) who were 
divided into two groups; 34 patients with HCC (HCC group), and 36 patients
without HCC (LC group) and 20 healthy volunteers (control group) were included.
Routine laboratory investigations and imaging studies were determined. TGF-β1
(Arg25Pro; 915G>C) and PNPLA3 (I148M; C>G) variants were evaluated using
real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR).
RESULTS: HCC group showed a significantly higher GG genotype distribution of
TGF-β1 (Arg25Pro) than the LC group (P= 0.008, OR: 7.083, CI 95%: 1.422 -
35.282). The distributions of GG genotype (P= 0.047) and G allele (P= 0.002, OR: 
4.395, CI 95%: 1.622 - 11.911) of PNPLA3 (I148M) were significantly higher in
total cirrhosis patients than controls.
CONCLUSION: TGF-β1 (Arg25Pro) GG variant may be associated with HCC risk in
HCV-related liver cirrhosis patients, while PNPLA3 (I148M) GG variant may be
associated with cirrhosis development but not HCC risk in HCV-related liver
cirrhosis patients.
