BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light both challenges and unique
opportunities regarding type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including the usage of 
telemedicine platforms.
METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital diabetes clinic. All
consecutive T1D patients during March and June 2021 were asked to fill out a
structured anonymous questionnaire that aimed to determine their preference
regarding continuous use of a virtual platform.
RESULTS: In total, 126 T1D patients answered the questionnaire, of whom 51% were 
under the age of 40, half were men, half used insulin pumps, and 69% used
continuous glucose monitoring. During the pandemic, the exposure of patients to
virtual visits has grown about twofold, from 29% to 53%. Of the respondents, 49% 
expressed an interest in future usage of a virtual platform, but most of them
preferred use in a hybrid manner. We found an association between preference to
use telemedicine in the future and younger age, previous virtual platform
experience, and confidence in being able to download data.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the COVID-19 experience has led to a
growing interest of T1D patients in using the hybrid format of telemedicine.
However, we still need to better understand who will benefit most from this
platform and assess its cost-effectiveness and organization.
