BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to 
determine the clinical characteristics, treatment approaches and the course of
pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) which developed associated 
with the influenza virus in the 2019-20 season.
METHODS: Patients included 1 month to 18 years who were diagnosed with PARDS
associated with the influenza virus in the 2019-20 season.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. The mean age of the
patients was 64.16 ± 6.53 months, with 60% of the group <5 years. Influenza A was
determined in 54 (80.5%) patients and Influenza B in 13 (19.5%). The majority of 
patients (73.1%) had a comorbidity. Fifty-eight (86.6%) patients were applied
with invasive mechanical ventilation, Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus
Conference classification was mild in 5 (8.6%), moderate in 22 (37.9%) and severe
in 31 (52.5%) patients. Ventilation was applied in the prone position to 40.3% of
the patients, and in nonconventional modes to 24.1%. A total of 22 (33%) patients
died, of which 4 had been previously healthy. Of the surviving 45 patients, 38
were discharged without support and 7 patients with a new morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Both Influenza A and Influenza B cause severe PARDS with similar
characteristics and at high rates. Influenza-related PARDS cause 33% mortality
and 15.5% morbidity among the study group. Healthy children, especially those
aged younger than 5 years, are also at risk.
