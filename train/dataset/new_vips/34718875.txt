Understanding the physical and chemical properties of viral infections at
molecular scales is a major challenge for the scientific community more so with
the outbreak of global pandemics. There is currently a lot of effort being placed
in identifying molecules that could act as putative drugs or blockers of viral
molecules. In this work, we computationally explore the importance in antiviral
activity of a less studied class of molecules, namely surfactants. We employ
all-atoms molecular dynamics simulations to study the interaction between the
receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the phospholipid
lecithin (POPC), in water. Our microsecond simulations show a preferential
binding of lecithin to the receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 with binding free
energies significantly larger than [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, hydrophobic 
interactions involving lecithin non-polar tails dominate these binding events,
which are also accompanied by dewetting of the receptor binding motif. Through an
analysis of fluctuations in the radius of gyration of the receptor-binding
domain, its contact maps with lecithin molecules, and distributions of water
molecules near the binding region, we elucidate molecular interactions that may
play an important role in interactions involving surfactant-type molecules and
viruses. We discuss our minimal computational model in the context of
lecithin-based liposomal nasal sprays as putative mitigating therapies for
COVID-19.
