Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) rely on helper viruses to transition from latency 
to lytic infection. Some AAV serotypes are secreted in a pre-lytic manner as free
or extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated particles, although mechanisms
underlying such are unknown. Here, we discover that the membrane-associated
accessory protein (MAAP), expressed from a frameshifted open reading frame in the
AAV cap gene, is a novel viral egress factor. MAAP contains a highly conserved,
cationic amphipathic domain critical for AAV secretion. Wild type or recombinant 
AAV with a mutated MAAP start site (MAAPΔ) show markedly attenuated secretion and
correspondingly, increased intracellular retention. Trans-complementation with
MAAP restored secretion of multiple AAV/MAAPΔ serotypes. Further, multiple
processing and analytical methods corroborate that one plausible mechanism by
which MAAP promotes viral egress is through AAV/EV association. In addition to
characterizing a novel viral egress factor, we highlight a prospective
engineering platform to modulate secretion of AAV vectors or other EV-associated 
cargo.
