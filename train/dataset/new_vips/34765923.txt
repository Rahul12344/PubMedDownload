HIV-1 infects blood CD4 T cells through the use of CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5
receptors, which can be targeted through blocking viral binding to CD4/CXCR4/CCR5
or virus-cell fusion. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 nuclear
entry can also be blocked through targeting a non-entry receptor, CD2. Cluster of
differentiation 2 (CD2) is an adhesion molecule highly expressed on human blood
CD4, particularly, memory CD4 T cells. We found that CD2 ligation with its
cell-free ligand LFA-3 or anti-CD2 antibodies rendered blood resting CD4 T cells 
highly resistant to HIV-1 infection. We further demonstrate that mechanistically,
CD2 binding initiates competitive signaling leading to cofilin activation and
localized actin polymerization around CD2, which spatially inhibits
HIV-1-initiated local actin polymerization needed for viral nuclear migration.
Our study identifies CD2 as a novel target to block HIV-1 infection of blood
resting T cells.
