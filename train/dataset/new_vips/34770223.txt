Education systems worldwide have been affected by a sudden interruption in
classroom learning because the coronavirus pandemic forced both the closure of
all schools in March 2020 and the beginning of distance learning from home, thus 
compelling families, schools, and students to work together in a more coordinated
fashion. The present systematic review was carried out following PRISMA
guidelines. The main objective was to present critical information on the
relationship between the family and the school in the face of the imposed
distance learning scenario caused by COVID-19. A total of 25 articles dealing
with the relationships established during the pandemic of any of the three agents
involved (family, students, and school) were analysed. The results showed that
the relationships between the three groups involved must be improved to some
extent to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of distance learning. In
conclusion, the educational scenario during the pandemic has been one of the most
significant challenges experienced in the recent history of education.
