BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is an issue of global health concern, and it seems to
be the next epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa after Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV). This study compared the perceptions of susceptibility to cervical cancer
and benefits of cervical cancer screening among women diagnosed and those with
unknown HIV status and determined the association between socio-demographic
factors and HIV status.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 600 women diagnosed with HIV 
and 600 women with unknown HIV status in the Central Region of Ghana. Convenience
sampling was used and a structured interview schedule was the main data
collection instrument. Data were analysed using frequencies, percentages,
chi-square test and independent samples t-test.
RESULTS: A high proportion of women diagnosed with HIV 94.8% (n = 569) and those 
with unknown HIV status 93.5% (n = 561) agreed that "screening can find cervical 
changes". Also, 58.0% (n = 348) of women diagnosed with HIV agreed that they have
been in polygamous relationships so they may get cervical cancer. There was a
statistically significant association between marital status (X2 = 167.071,
p = 0.001), religion (X2 = 57.720, p = 0.001), level of education (X2 = 118.997, 
p = 0.001), employment status (X2 = 782.646, p = 0.001) and HIV status. A
comparison of the mean difference for women diagnosed and those with unknown HIV 
status in relation to perceived benefits of cervical cancer screening showed a
statistically significant difference (t = 7.418, df = 1198, p = 0.001).
Nonetheless, there was no statistically significant difference in the means for
women diagnosed and those with unknown HIV status regarding perceived
susceptibility to cervical cancer (t = 0.935, df = 1198, p = 0.351).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with HIV perceived higher benefits of cervical cancer
screening. Perception of susceptibility to cervical cancer by women with and
those without HIV need to be addressed in efforts to improve their health.
Furthermore, interventions for women with HIV should consider some important
sociodemographic factors.
