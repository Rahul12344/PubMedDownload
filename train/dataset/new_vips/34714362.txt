The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires new treatments both to
alleviate the symptoms and to prevent the spread of this disease. Previous
studies demonstrated good antiviral and virucidal activity of phospholipase A2s
(PLA2s) from snake venoms against viruses from different families but there was
no data for coronaviruses. Here we show that PLA2s from snake venoms protect Vero
E6 cells against SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects. PLA2s showed low cytotoxicity to 
Vero E6 cells with some activity at micromolar concentrations, but strong
antiviral activity at nanomolar concentrations. Dimeric PLA2 from the viper
Vipera nikolskii and its subunits manifested especially potent virucidal effects,
which were related to their phospholipolytic activity, and inhibited cell-cell
fusion mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Moreover, PLA2s interfered 
with binding both of an antibody against ACE2 and of the receptor-binding domain 
of the glycoprotein S to 293T/ACE2 cells. This is the first demonstration of a
detrimental effect of PLA2s on β-coronaviruses. Thus, snake PLA2s are promising
for the development of antiviral drugs that target the viral envelope, and could 
also prove to be useful tools to study the interaction of viruses with host
cells.
