We present a case of viral myocarditis in the setting of Coxsackievirus and
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This case is unique as there were 
two underlying active infections that could have caused the patient's
myocarditis. Though both viruses have been shown to cause myocarditis, it was
difficult to differentiate the exact etiology in this particular case. The unique
nature of this case presents the opportunity to explore whether further
diagnostic workup is warranted.
