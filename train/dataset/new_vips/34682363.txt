The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has represented a challenge to
medical practice in Saudi Arabia and worldwide. In contrary to the increasing
numbers of COVID-19 patients, there was a limitation in the capacity of medical
practices and access to healthcare. A growing body of evidence from healthcare
settings in Saudi Arabia and worldwide has suggested a possible role for
telemedicine in responding to this evolving need. Telemedicine can be used for
triage, direct care, follow-up, and consultation. It could be delivered through
synchronous, asynchronous, and mixed approaches. While telemedicine has several
advantages, such as accessibility and cost-effectiveness, its diagnostic
reliability should be further investigated. The Saudi Vision (2030) has drawn up 
a roadmap to invest in digital healthcare during the coming decade; however, some
barriers related to using telemedicine in Saudi healthcare settings, including
cultural issues and technical difficulties, should be openly discussed. In
addition, before putting telemedicine in practice on a wide scale in Saudi
Arabia, more efforts should be carried out to issue updated legislation and
regulations, discuss and respond to ethical concerns, and ensure data security.
