Cotton is the most important crop for the production of natural fibres used in
the textile industry. High salinity, drought, cold and high temperature represent
serious abiotic stresses, which seriously threaten cotton production.
Phospholipase AS has an irreplaceable role in lipid signal transmission, growth
and development and stress events. Phospholipase A can be divided into three
families: PLA1, PLA2 and pPLA. Among them, the PLA1 family is rarely studied in
plants. In order to study the potential functions of the PLA1 family in cotton,
the bioinformatics analysis of the PLA1 family was correlated with cotton
adversity, and tissue-specific analysis was performed. Explore the
structure-function relationship of PLA1 members. It is found that the expression 
of GbPLA1-32 gene is affected by a variety of environmental stimuli, indicating
that it plays a very important role in stress and hormone response, and closely
associates the cotton adversity with this family. Through further functional
verification, we found that virus-induced GbPLA1-32 gene silencing (VIGS) caused 
Gossypium barbadense to be sensitive to salt stress. This research provides an
important basis for further research on the molecular mechanism of cotton
resistance to abiotic stress.
