The virions of all enveloped viruses, including those of the Herpesviridae, must 
bind to the cell surface then undergo a process of membrane fusion between the
cell plasma membrane and the virus particle envelope. As for all herpesviruses,
glycoproteins in the virion envelope are the modus operandi of these events.
