Powassan virus lineage 2 (deer tick virus) is an emergent threat to American
public health, causing severe neurologic disease. Its life cycle in nature
remains poorly understood. We use a host-specific retrotransposon-targeted real
time PCR assay to test the hypothesis that white-footed mice, considered the main
eastern U.S. reservoir of the coinfecting agent of Lyme disease, is the reservoir
for deer tick virus. Of 20 virus-infected host-seeking nymphal black-legged ticks
65% fed on shrews and none on mice. The proportion of ticks feeding on shrews at 
a site is positively associated with prevalence of viral infection, but not the
Lyme disease agent. Viral RNA is detected in the brain of one shrew. We conclude 
that shrews are a likely reservoir host for deer tick virus and that host
bloodmeal analysis can provide direct evidence to incriminate reservoir hosts,
thereby promoting our understanding of the ecology of tick-borne infections.
