A key step in infections by enveloped viruses, such as influenza, is the fusion
between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane, which allows the virus to 
insert its genetic material into the host cell and replicate. The influenza virus
fusion process is promoted by hemagglutinin (HA), a glycoprotein that contains
three identical monomers composed of two polypeptide chains (HA1 and HA2). Early 
studies on this protein revealed that HA-mediated fusion involves the insertion
of the HA2 N-terminal segment into the host membrane and that this segment, known
as the fusion peptide, is a key player in the fusion process. This mini-review
highlights the main findings that have been obtained by experimental and
computational studies on the HA fusion peptide, which give us a glimpse of its
mode of action.
