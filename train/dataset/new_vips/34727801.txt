PURPOSE: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in eye
healthcare workers (EHCW) in the largest ophthalmology centre in Guatemala and
factors associated with antibody positivity.
METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional sero-survey in all the staff at the
largest ophthalmology centre in Guatemala. Serum samples were collected and
tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing Roche Elecsys
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay. Results were reported as reactive or non-reactive.
According to patient exposure the staff were divided into low risk (technicians, 
domestic and administrative staff) and high risk (nurses, ophthalmologists,
anaesthesiologists, and optometrists). Among those with positive antibodies, they
were given a survey that included demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure,
and related symptomatology. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors
associated with antibody positivity.
RESULTS: On November 25th a total of 94 healthcare workers were sero-surveyed,
mean age was 34.15 years (±8.41), most (57.44%) were females. Seroprevalence was 
18%, the majority (77%) were in the low-risk group; while 64% at high-risk,
tested negative. Those at low exposure, were five times more likely to have
antibodies than those at high exposure (OR:5.69; 95% CI 1.69-19.13). Age and
gender were not associated to seropositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a similar seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in EHCW
to what has been reported in other healthcare groups. Seropositivity was higher
among HCW with fewer patient exposure, hence the probability of community
transmission.Key messagesEven though eye healthcare workers are believed to be at
higher risk of infection, the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this
group is comparable to what has been reported previously in other healthcare
groups.
