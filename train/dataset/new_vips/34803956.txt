Hepatitis viruses are primary causative agents of hepatitis and represent a major
source of public health problems in the world. The host innate immune system
forms the first line of defense against hepatitis viruses. Hepatitis viruses are 
sensed by specific pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that subsequently
trigger the innate immune response and interferon (IFN) production. However,
hepatitis viruses evade host immune surveillance via multiple strategies, which
help compromise the innate immune response and create a favorable environment for
viral replication. Therefore, this article reviews published findings regarding
host innate immune sensing and response against hepatitis viruses. Furthermore,
we also focus on how hepatitis viruses abrogate the antiviral effects of the host
innate immune system.
