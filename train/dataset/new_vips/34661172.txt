Vaccinia virus is a large double-stranded DNA virus that is widely used to
express foreign genes from different origins. We generated recombinant vaccinia
virus that expresses a viral inhibitor to examine its effect on virus-induced
necroptosis. We provide a detailed protocol to describe the generation of
recombinant vaccinia virus, validation of protein expression, and determination
of necroptosis using live cell imaging. This approach can be adapted to examine
the effect of other cell death regulators on virus-induced cell death. For
complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Liu
et al. (2021).
