OBJECTIVE: To present Australia-wide data on paediatric COVID-19 and multisystem 
inflammatory syndromes to inform health service provision and vaccination
prioritisation.
DESIGN: Prospective, multicentre cohort study.
SETTING: Eight tertiary paediatric hospitals across six Australian states and
territories in an established research surveillance network-Paediatric Active
Enhanced Disease (PAEDS).
PARTICIPANTS: All children aged <19 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection including
COVID-19, Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with
SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) and Kawasaki-like disease TS infection (KD-TS) treated at a 
PAEDS site from 24 March 2020 to 31 December 2020.
INTERVENTION: Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
MAIN OUTCOME: Incidence of severe disease among children with COVID-19, PIMS-TS
and KD-TS. We also compared KD epidemiology before and during the COVID-19
pandemic.
RESULTS: Among 386 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 381 (98.7%) had COVID-19
(median 6.3 years (IQR 2.1-12.8),53.3% male) and 5 (1.3%) had multisystem
inflammatory syndromes (PIMS-TS, n=4; KD-TS, n=1) (median 7.9 years (IQR
7.8-9.8)). Most children with COVID-19 (n=278; 73%) were Australian-born from
jurisdictions with highest community transmission. Comorbidities were present in 
72 (18.9%); cardiac and respiratory comorbidities were most common (n=32/72;44%).
37 (9.7%) children with COVID-19 were hospitalised, and two (0.5%) required
intensive care. Postinfective inflammatory syndromes (PIMS-TS/KD-TS) were
uncommon (n=5; 1.3%), all were hospitalised and three (3/5; 60%) required
intensive care management. All children recovered and there were no deaths. KD
incidence remained stable during the pandemic compared with prepandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Most children with COVID-19 had mild disease. Severe disease was
less frequent than reported in high prevalence settings. Preventative strategies,
such as vaccination, including children and adolescents, could reduce both the
acute and postinfective manifestations of the disease.
