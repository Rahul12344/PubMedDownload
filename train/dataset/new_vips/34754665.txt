The COVID-19 virus is well known to cause respiratory tract infections but
several non-respiratory presentations and post-infectious complications have been
well reported since its origin. With this case report, we present a rare
manifestation of COVID-19 infection that presented as acute cerebellitis. This is
a case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male patient who presented with altered mental 
status and ataxia. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection about five days prior
to presenting to the hospital. Neurological exam was consistent with cerebellar
symptoms like broad bases gait, truncal ataxia and subsequent imaging revealed
white matter degeneration and edema of the cerebellar hemispheres. The symptoms
completely resolved following treatment of ongoing COVID-19 infection with
corticosteroids and intravenous remdesivir. With this case report, we intend to
discuss the available literature regarding the clinical manifestations,
management, and prognosis of COVID-19-induced cerebellitis.
