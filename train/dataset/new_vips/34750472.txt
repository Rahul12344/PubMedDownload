The huge worldwide demand for vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated the 
continued development of novel improved formulations capable of reducing the
burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we evaluated novel protein subunit
vaccine formulations containing a resistin-trimerized spike antigen, SmT1. When
combined with sulfated lactosyl archaeol (SLA) archaeosome adjuvant, formulations
induced robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.
Antibodies had strong neutralizing activity, preventing viral spike binding and
viral infection. In addition, the formulations were highly efficacious in a
hamster challenge model reducing viral load and body weight loss even after a
single vaccination. The antigen-specific antibodies generated by our vaccine
formulations had stronger neutralizing activity than human convalescent plasma,
neutralizing the spike proteins of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern.
As such, our SmT1 antigen along with SLA archaeosome adjuvant comprise a
promising platform for the development of efficacious protein subunit vaccine
formulations for SARS-CoV-2.
