RATIONALE: The alarmins IL-33 and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) contribute to
type-2 inflammation and asthma pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether P2Y13 receptor (P2Y13-R), a purinergic G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and risk allele for asthma, regulates the release
of IL-33 and HMGB1.
METHODS: Bronchial biopsies were obtained from healthy and asthmatic subjects.
Primary human airway epithelial cells (AECs), primary mouse (m)AECs, or C57Bl/6
mice were inoculated with various aeroallergens or respiratory viruses, and the
nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and release of alarmins measured by
immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The role of P2Y13-R in AEC function and in the
onset, progression, and an exacerbation of experimental asthma, was assessed
using pharmacological antagonists and P2Y13-R gene-deleted mice.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Aeroallergen-exposure induced the extracellular
release of ADP and ATP, nucleotides that activate P2Y13-R. ATP, ADP, aeroallergen
(house dust mite, cockroach or Alternaria) or virus exposure induced the
nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and subsequent release of IL-33 and HMGB1,
and this response was ablated by genetic deletion or pharmacological antagonism
of P2Y13. In mice, prophylactic or therapeutic P2Y13-R blockade attenuated asthma
onset, and critically, ablated the severity of a rhinovirus-associated
exacerbation in a high-fidelity experimental model of chronic asthma. Moreover,
P2Y13-R antagonism derepressed antiviral immunity, increasing IFN-λ production
and decreasing viral copies in the lung.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify P2Y13-R as a novel gatekeeper of the nuclear alarmins
IL-33 and HMGB1, and demonstrate that the targeting of this GPCR via genetic
deletion or treatment with a small-molecule antagonist protects against the onset
and exacerbations of experimental asthma.
