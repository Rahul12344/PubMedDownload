It is almost more than a year that earth has faced a severe worldwide problem
called COVID-19. In December 2019, the origin of the epidemic was found in China.
After that, this contagious virus was reported almost all over the world with
different variants. Besides all the healthcare system attempts, quarantine, and
vaccination, it is needed to study the dynamical behavior of this disease
specifically. One of the practical tools that may help scientists analyze the
dynamical behavior of epidemic disease is mathematical models. Accordingly, here,
a novel mathematical system is introduced. Also, the complex behavior of this
model is investigated considering different dynamical analyses. The results
represent that some range of parameters may lead the model to chaotic behavior.
Moreover, comparing the two same bifurcation diagrams with different initial
conditions reveals that the model has multi-stability.
