Publishing, discussing, envisioning, modeling, designing and experimentally
determining RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures involve preparation of
two-dimensional (2D) drawings that depict critical functional features of the
subject molecules, such as noncanonical base pairs and protein contacts. Here, we
describe RiboDraw, new software for crafting these drawings. We illustrate the
features of RiboDraw by applying it to several RNAs, including the Escherichia
coli tRNA-Phe, the P4-P6 domain of Tetrahymena ribozyme, a -1 ribosomal
frameshift stimulation element from beet western yellows virus and the 5'
untranslated region of SARS-CoV-2. We show secondary structure diagrams of the
23S and 16S subunits of the E. coli ribosome that reflect noncanonical base
pairs, ribosomal proteins and structural motifs, and that convey the relative
positions of these critical features in 3D space. This software is a MATLAB
package freely available at https://github.com/DasLab/RiboDraw.
