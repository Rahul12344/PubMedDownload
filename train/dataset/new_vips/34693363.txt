Most latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proviruses are defective and
cannot produce infectious virions. Thus, the number of HIV proviruses with intact
genomes is a relevant clinical parameter to assess therapies for HIV cure. We
describe high-molecular-weight DNA isolation, followed by restriction enzyme
fragmentation that limits cutting within the HIV genome. Multiplexed droplet
digital PCR quantifies five targets spanning the HIV genome to estimate
potentially intact proviral copies. A reference assay counts the number of T
lymphocytes and assesses the level of DNA shearing. For complete details on the
use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Levy et al. (2021).
