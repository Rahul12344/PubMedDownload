Objectives: This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
the psychological, mental health and quality of life among Bangladeshi residents.
Study design: A purposive cross-sectional study of quality of life during the
COVID-19 pandemic was performed.
Methods: Respondents completed a modified questionnaire that determined the
Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of psychological distress impact, impact 
on government strategies, awareness and lifestyles, and impact on expectation of 
quality life change. A total of 465 (male = 330 and female = 135) respondents
participated in this study.
Results: The overall mean age of respondents was 28.42 ± 7.07 years, and 63.4%,
44.1% and 50.3% were unmarried, were in the middle-income family group and had a 
masters or PhD qualification, respectively. The overall mean IES score of
respondents was 80.89 ± 8.91, which reflects a stressful impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on physical and mental health problems. Only 27.75% of respondents had
an IES score ≥75. More than half of respondents (57.8%) reported that they did
not feel lonely and hopeless. In terms of preventative measures, the majority of 
the respondents (80.2%) reported that they did not wash their hands frequently
with soap and sanitiser for at least 20 s to reduce spread of the virus. During
the pandemic, more than half of the respondents (56.8%) claimed that they faced
serious problems in education.
Conclusions: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant mental and
physical health problems.
