The pandemic of COVID-19 has been haunting us for almost the past two years.
Although, the vaccination drive is in full swing throughout the world, different 
mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are making it very difficult to put an end to
the pandemic. The second wave in India, one of the worst sufferers of this
pandemic, can be mainly attributed to the Delta variant i.e. B.1.617.2. Thus, it 
is very important to analyse and understand the mutational trajectory of
SARS-CoV-2 through the study of the 26 virus proteins. In this regard, more than 
17,000 protein sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes are analysed using
entropy-based approach in order to find the monthly mutational trajectory.
Furthermore, Hellinger distance is also used to show the difference of the
mutation events between the consecutive months for each of the 26 SARS-CoV-2
protein. The results show that the mutation rates and the mutation events of the 
viral proteins though changing in the initial months, start stabilizing later on 
for mainly the four structural proteins while the non-structural proteins mostly 
exhibit a more constant trend. As a consequence, it can be inferred that the
evolution of the new mutative configurations will eventually reduce.
