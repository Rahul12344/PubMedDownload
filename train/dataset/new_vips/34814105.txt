Several Zika virus (ZIKV) seroprevalence studies have been conducted in Africa,
Asia, Oceania, the Americas, and the Caribbean. However, studies on ZIKV
seroprevalence are limited in Malaysia though several studies have shown that the
disease is endemic in the Malaysian state of Sabah. To evaluate the
seroprevalence of ZIKV infection, 818 serum samples were collected from febrile
patients and healthy blood donors from the Kudat and Kota Kinabalu districts in
Sabah from 2017 to 2018. They were screened for ZIKV infection by IgM and IgG
ELISA, and positive ZIKV IgM samples were subjected to a 90% neutralization test 
for confirmation. Twenty-four (6% [95% CI 4 to 8]) confirmed and two (0.5% [95%
CI 0.13 to 1.8]) probable ZIKV infections were detected among 400 febrile illness
patients. Of 418 healthy blood donor samples, six (1.4% [95% CI 0.65 to 3]) were 
determined as confirmed ZIKV infections and six (1.4% [95% CI 0.65 to 3])
indicated probable ZIKV infection. This is the first study on the seroprevalence 
of ZIKV infections among patients and healthy blood donors in Sabah. Compared
with previous studies in Malaysia, this study shows that the incidence of ZIKV
infection has increased. It also suggests that a sero-surveillance system is
essential to determine the circulation of ZIKV in Sabah, Malaysia.
