BACKGROUND: This research work is elaborated investigation of COVID-19 data for
Weibull distribution under indeterminacy using time truncated repetitive sampling
plan. The proposed design parameters like sample size, acceptance sample number
and rejection sample number are obtained for known indeterminacy parameter.
METHODS: The plan parameters and corresponding tables are developed for specified
indeterminacy parametric values. The conclusion from the outcome of the proposed 
design is that when indeterminacy values increase the average sample number (ASN)
reduces.
RESULTS: The proposed repetitive sampling plan methodology application is given
using COVID-19 data belong to Italy. The efficiency of the proposed sampling plan
is compared with the existing sampling plans.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the tables and COVID-19 data illustration, it is concluded
that the proposed plan required a smaller sample size as examined with the
available sampling plans in the literature.
