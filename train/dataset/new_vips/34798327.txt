OBJECTIVE: To analyze the literature to determine whether autohemotherapy has any
effect either clinically or on the immune system on viral diseases on the last
ten years.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: Searches from the year 2010, with at least 5 patients were conducted in 
PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, LILACS, SciELO, and Web of Science
databases. Hand searches were performed in systematic reviews and literature
reviews related to autohemotherapy. Unpublished manuscripts were hand-searched in
specialized journals.
RESULTS: Eight articles were included. Hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and 
Coronavirus were evaluated. Autohemotherapy had good results in hepatitis C,
hepatitis B, and Coronavirus.
CONCLUSION: Autohemotherapy is a safe practice that improves symptoms in the
treatment of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Coronavirus. It is
necessary to perform more prospective comparative studies with homogeneous
protocols.
