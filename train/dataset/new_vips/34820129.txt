Varicella-zoster virus infection also known as chickenpox is a common clinical
entity especially among unvaccinated children and adults. It is said that
severity increases as the age increases. Approximately 5%-15% of adult varicella 
can produce pulmonary manifestations. Varicella pneumonitis occurs especially in 
at-risk individuals like pregnant, smokers, chronic lung diseases like chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunosuppression. The authors describe a case
of severe varicella pneumonitis in a healthy immunocompetent middle-aged woman
which posed a great diagnostic challenge. The authors also want to highlight that
how a common disease can pose a diagnostic dilemma and present with
life-threatening organ failure and timely intervention is needed to prevent
mortality.
