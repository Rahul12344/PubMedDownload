Infectious bronchitis (IB) of chickens is a highly contagious disease
characterized by damage of the respiratory system and reproductive organs in
young animals caused by a virus of the genus Gamma coronavirus. The condition of 
the respiratory system caused by the IB virus in chickens has many similarities
with the pathology of the respiratory system caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The 
effectiveness of virucidal drugs (Argovit, Triviron, Ecocid, and lauric acid
monoglyceride) was tested on chickens inoculated with a tenfold dose of a vaccine
strain based on the attenuated virus H120 against IB of chickens. On the 6th day 
after inoculation, inflammatory changes in the intestines, lungs, and thymus were
observed in the control group. The experimental groups were characterized by less
pronounced inflammatory reactions and a lower proportion of thymus and lung
probes containing genomic IB virus RNA. Since the virucidal activity of four
orally administrated formulations was possible only in the intestine, the
experimental data indirectly confirmed the hypothesis of the possibility of the
predominant accumulation of coronaviruses in the intestine and subsequent lung
damage due to the hematogenous redistribution of viral particles and IBV
antigens. It was suggested that other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 can
implement a similar mechanism.
