Insects are infected by a diverse set of RNA viruses that are more broadly
distinguished by their ability to infect single or multiple host species. During 
replication into the host cell, partial or complete double strand DNA derived
from the viral genome may be integrated into their host genomes giving origin to 
endogenous viral elements (EVEs). EVEs from RNA viruses have been identified in a
variety of insect genomes showing different evolutionary trajectories: from
highly degraded viral genomic remains to partial and complete viral coding
regions. Limited functional knowledge exists about RNA EVEs impact on hosts and
circulating viruses, but exciting results are emerging showing a complex arms
race interplay that influences the evolutionary trajectory of these interacting
entities.
