PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This systematic review aims to collect evidence regarding the 
impact of the SarsCov-2 pandemic on people affected by eating disorders (EDs)
targeting the following variables: psychopathology changes, mechanisms of
vulnerability or resilience, and perception of treatment modifications during the
pandemic.
RECENT FINDINGS: Since the beginning of the pandemic, a mental health
deterioration has been detected in the general population and especially in
people affected by pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, mental
healthcare has moved toward online treatment. ED people showed a trend toward
worsening of ED-specific psychopathology and impairment in general
psychopathology. The most common vulnerability mechanisms were social isolation
and feelings of uncertainty, while heightened self-care and reduced social
pressure were resilience factors. The online treatment, although raising many
concerns related to its quality, was considered the best alternative to the
face-to-face approach. These findings may support the idea that stressful events 
contribute to the exacerbation of ED psychopathology and highlight the relevance 
of internalizing symptoms in EDs. The identification of putative risk and
resilience variables as well as of subjective factors affecting online treatment 
perception may inform healthcare professionals and may promote more personalized 
approaches.
