INTRODUCTION: Blood donor studies offer a unique opportunity to screen healthy
populations for the presence of antibodies to emerging infections. We describe
the use of blood donor specimens to track the 'first-wave' of the COVID-19
pandemic in Ireland.
METHODOLOGY: A random selection of donor samples received by the Irish Blood
Transfusion Service (IBTS) between February and September 2020 (n = 8,509) were
screened by multiple commercial SARs-CoV-2 antibody assays. The antibody
detection rate was adjusted to the population to determine the SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence in Ireland.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection rose significantly during the first peak
of COVID-19 infection, increasing from 0.3% in March, to 2.9% in April
(p < 0.0001, The first SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive donor samples were collected 
on the 17th February 2020, 2 weeks prior to the first official notification. This
is the earliest serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the Irish
population. Our results also show a significantly higher antibody prevalence in
the Capital city and in donors less than 40 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody
reactivity across all age groups and counties. The critical value of blood donor 
seroprevalence studies is apparent in this report which identified the earliest
serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ireland, as well as documenting
the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland over time.
