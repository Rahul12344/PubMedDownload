BACKGROUND: HIV-2 resistance to integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) is 
characterized by two main pathways: (i) mutations at codons 143, 148 and155; and 
(ii) amino acid insertion after integrase codon 231 (231ins).
OBJECTIVES: To complete INSTI resistance data on HIV-2 by determining the viral
replicative capacity and INSTI phenotypic susceptibility of integrase mutants
obtained through site-directed mutagenesis.
METHODS: Site-directed mutants (SDMs) were constructed and viral stocks produced.
Viral replicative capacity was assessed by measuring HIV-2 viral load at days 3, 
7 and 14. In vitro phenotypic susceptibility was measured using the ANRS PBMC
assay.
RESULTS: Viruses bearing 231ins did not present impaired replicative capacity,
except the 231ins GIRGK mutant. A 231ins GK SDM was resistant to raltegravir and 
cabotegravir, but remained susceptible to dolutegravir and bictegravir. SDMs
harbouring a 5 amino acid insertion (GYKGK or SREGK) were both resistant to all
INSTIs. The SDM with T97A+N155H, with or without E92Q, was resistant to all
INSTIs, except bictegravir.
CONCLUSIONS: These first data on the newly described resistance pathway 231ins,
using site-directed mutagenesis, showed no measurable impact on viral fitness and
confirmed the decreased susceptibility to a first-generation INSTI (raltegravir) 
and cabotegravir. Resistance to second-generation INSTIs (dolutegravir and
bictegravir) occurred for mutants with a 5 amino acid 231ins.
