With the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 now in its second year, there
remains an urgent need for diagnostic testing that can identify infected
individuals, particularly those who harbor infectious virus. Various RT-PCR
strategies have been proposed to identify specific viral RNA species that may
predict the presence of infectious virus, including detection of transcriptional 
intermediates (e.g. subgenomic RNA [sgRNA]) and replicative intermediates (e.g.
negative-strand RNA species). Using a novel primer/probe set for detection of
subgenomic (sg)E transcripts, we successfully identified 100% of specimens
containing culturable SARS-CoV-2 from a set of 126 clinical samples (total sgE CT
values ranging from 12.3-37.5). This assay showed superior performance compared
to a previously published sgRNA assay and to a negative-strand RNA assay, both of
which failed to detect target RNA in a subset of samples from which we isolated
live virus. In addition, total levels of viral RNA (genome, negative-strand, and 
sgE) detected with the WHO/CharitÃ© primer-probe set correlated closely with
levels of infectious virus. Specifically, infectious virus was not detected in
samples with a CT above 31.0. Clinical samples with higher levels of viral RNA
also displayed cytopathic effect (CPE) more quickly than those with lower levels 
of viral RNA. Finally, we found that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 samples is
significantly dependent on the cell type used for viral isolation, as Vero E6
cells expressing TMRPSS2 extended the analytical sensitivity of isolation by more
than 3 CT compared to parental Vero E6 cells and resulted in faster isolation.
Our work shows that using a total viral RNA Ct cut-off of >31 or specifically
testing for sgRNA can serve as an effective rule-out test for the presence of
culturable virus.
