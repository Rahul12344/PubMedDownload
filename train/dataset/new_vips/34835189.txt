Despite the routine use of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS)-modified live vaccines, serious concerns are currently being raised due to
their quick reversion to virulence and limited cross-protection against divergent
PRRS virus (PRRSV) strains circulating in the field. Therefore, a PRRS chimeric
vaccine (JB1) was produced using a DNA-launched infectious clone by replacing
open reading frames (ORFs) 3-6 with those from a mixture of two genetically
different PRRSV2 strains (K07-2273 and K08-1054) and ORF1a with that from a
mutation-resistant PRRSV strain (RVRp22) exhibiting an attenuated phenotype. To
evaluate the safety and cross-protective efficacy of JB1 in a reproductive model,
eight PRRS-negative pregnant sows were purchased and divided into four groups.
Four sows in two of the groups were vaccinated with JB1, and the other 4 sows
were untreated at gestational day 60. At gestational day 93, one vaccinated group
and one nonvaccinated group each were challenged with either K07-2273 or
K08-1054. All of the sows aborted or delivered until gestation day 115 (24 days
post challenge), and the newborn piglets were observed up to the 28th day after
birth, which was the end of the experiment. Overall, pregnant sows of the
JB1-vaccinated groups showed no meaningful viremia after vaccination and
significant reductions in viremia with K07-2273 and K08-1054, exhibiting
significantly higher levels of serum virus-neutralizing antibodies than
non-vaccinated sows. Moreover, the JB1-vaccinated groups did not exhibit any
abortion due to vaccination and showed improved piglet viability and birth
weight. The piglets from JB1-vaccinated sows displayed lower viral concentrations
in serum and fewer lung lesions compared with those of the piglets from the
nonvaccinated sows. Therefore, JB1 is a safe and effective vaccine candidate that
confers simultaneous protection against two genetically different PRRSV strains.
