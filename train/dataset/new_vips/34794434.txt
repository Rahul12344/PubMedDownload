BACKGROUND: By August 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has been less severe in
sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere. In Malawi, there have been three subsequent
epidemic waves. We therefore aimed to describe the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
exposure in Malawi.
METHODS: We measured the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amongst
randomly selected blood transfusion donor sera in Malawi from January 2020 to
July 2021 using a cross-sectional study design. In a subset, we also assessed in 
vitro neutralisation against the original variant (D614G WT) and the Beta
variant.
RESULTS: A total of 5085 samples were selected from the blood donor database, of 
which 4075 (80.1%) were aged 20-49 years. Of the total, 1401 were seropositive.
After adjustment for assay characteristics and applying population weights,
seropositivity reached peaks in October 2020 (18.5%) and May 2021 (64.9%)
reflecting the first two epidemic waves. Unlike the first wave, both urban and
rural areas had high seropositivity in the second wave, Balaka (rural, 66.2%,
April 2021), Blantyre (urban, 75.6%, May 2021), Lilongwe (urban, 78.0%, May
2021), and Mzuzu (urban, 74.6%, April 2021). Blantyre and Mzuzu also show
indications of the start of a third pandemic wave with seroprevalence picking up 
again in July 2021 (Blantyre, 81.7%; Mzuzu, 71.0%). More first wave sera showed
in vitro neutralisation activity against the original variant (78% [7/9]) than
the beta variant (22% [2/9]), while more second wave sera showed neutralisation
activity against the beta variant (75% [12/16]) than the original variant (63%
[10/16]).
CONCLUSION: The findings confirm extensive SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi over two
epidemic waves with likely poor cross-protection to reinfection from the first on
the second wave. The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 exposure will therefore need to be
taken into account in the formulation of the COVID-19 vaccination policy in
Malawi and across the region. Future studies should use an adequate sample size
for the assessment of neutralisation activity across a panel of SARS-CoV-2
variants of concern/interest to estimate community immunity.
