BACKGROUND: COVID-19 may present with a variety of clinical syndromes, however,
the upper airway and the lower respiratory tract are the principle sites of
infection. Previous work on respiratory viral infections demonstrated that airway
inflammation results in the release of volatile organic compounds as well as
nitric oxide. The detection of these gases from patients' exhaled breath offers a
novel potential diagnostic target for COVID-19 that would offer real-time
screening of patients for COVID-19 infection.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present here a breath tester utilizing a catalytically
active material, which allows for the temporal manifestation of the gaseous
biomarkers' interactions with the sensor, thus giving a distinct breath print of 
the disease. A total of 46 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients on mechanical
ventilation participated in the study, 23 with active COVID-19 respiratory
infection and 23 non-COVID-19 controls. Exhaled breath bags were collected on ICU
days 1, 3, 7, and 10 or until liberation from mechanical ventilation. The
breathalyzer detected high exhaled nitric oxide (NO) concentration with a
distinctive pattern for patients with active COVID-19 pneumonia. The COVID-19
"breath print" has the pattern of the small Greek letter omega (). The "breath
print" identified patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with 88% accuracy upon their
admission to the ICU. Furthermore, the sensitivity index of the breath print
(which scales with the concentration of the key biomarker ammonia) appears to
correlate with duration of COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The implication of this breath tester technology for the rapid
screening for COVID-19 and potentially detection of other infectious diseases in 
the future.
