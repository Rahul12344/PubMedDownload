BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the health
system worldwide. The organ and tissue donation and transplantation (OTDT) system
is no exception and has had to face ethical challenges related to the pandemic,
such as risks of infection and resource allocation. In this setting, many
Canadian transplant programs halted their activities during the first wave of the
pandemic.
METHOD: To inform future ethical guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic or
other public health emergencies of international concern, we conducted a
literature review to summarize the ethical issues.
RESULTS: This literature review identified three categories of ethical
challenges. The first one describes the general ethical issues and challenges
reported by OTDT organizations and transplantation programs, such as risks of
COVID-19 transmission and infection to transplant recipients and healthcare
professionals during the transplant process, risk of patient waitlist mortality
or further resource strain where transplant procedures have been delayed or
halted, and resource allocation. The second category describes ethical challenges
related to informed consent in the context of uncertainty and virtual consent.
Finally, the third category describes ethical issues related to organ allocation,
such as social considerations in selecting transplant candidates.
CONCLUSION: This literature review highlights the salient ethical issues related 
to OTDT during the current COVID-19 pandemic. As medical and scientific knowledge
about COVID-19 increases, the uncertainties related to this disease will decrease
and the associated ethical issues will continue to evolve.
