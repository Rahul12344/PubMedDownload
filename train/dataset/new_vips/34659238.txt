The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) elicited by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused devastating health, economic and
social impact worldwide. Its clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic to
respiratory failure and multi-organ failure or death. The pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection is attributed to a complex interplay between virus and host 
immune response. It involves activation of multiple inflammatory pathways leading
to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, resulting in tissue damage, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Accumulating
evidence has raised concern over the long-term health effects of COVID-19.
Importantly, the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 may have devastating
consequences in the brain. This review provides a conceptual framework on how the
virus tricks the host immune system to induce infection and cause severe disease.
We also explore the key differences between mild and severe COVID-19 and its
short- and long-term effects, particularly on the human brain.
