BACKGROUND: Given the harms associated with tobacco use, continuing the provision
of smoking cessation treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical. The aim 
of this study was to examine pandemic-related changes in enrolment, total
treatment use and participant characteristics in a large, publicly funded smoking
cessation program in Ontario, Canada.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of patients who enrolled in the
program between Jan. 1, 2018, and Dec. 7, 2020. We used descriptive statistics to
examine changes in treatment use. To test for differences in sociodemographic and
health variables, we used segmented mixed-effects regression with a break point
on Mar. 17, 2020, when Ontario declared a state of emergency. We tested 25
variables, using Holm's correction for multiplicity.
RESULTS: We analyzed 60 373 enrolments. In the month after the break point,
enrolments fell 69% and total visits fell 42% relative to previous years. After
Mar. 17, 2020, those who enrolled were less likely to report employment in the
previous week (absolute expected difference -12.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
-15.0% to -9.8%); were more likely to be occasional (1.3%, 95% CI 0.6% to 1.9%)
or noncurrent smokers (1.7%, 95% CI 0.8% to 2.6%); were less likely to have set a
target quit date (-4.8%, 95% CI -7.0% to -2.6%); and were more likely to have a
physical health (6.6%, 95% CI 4.0% to 9.2%), mental health (4.6%, 95% CI 1.9% to 
7.2%) or substance use diagnosis (3.5%, 95% CI 1.3% to 5.6%).
INTERPRETATION: Sharp decreases in new enrolments and subsequent visits to
smoking cessation programs were seen when pandemic restrictions were implemented 
in Ontario, but the characteristics of the people who accessed the programs did
not change markedly. Incorporating an equity perspective is essential when new
models of care for smoking cessation are developed.
