A probe of a patient, seeking help in an emergency ward of a French hospital in
late December 2019 because of Influenza like symptoms, was retrospectively tested
positive to COVID-19. Despite the early appearance of the virus in Europe, the
prevalence and virulence appeared to be low for several weeks, before the spread 
and severity of symptoms increased exponentially, yet with marked spatial and
temporal differences. Here, we compare the possible linkages between peaks of
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the sudden, explosive increase of
hospitalizations and mortality rates in the Swiss Canton of Ticino, and the
Greater Paris and London regions. We argue that these peaks of fine particulate
matter are primarily occurring during thermal inversion of the boundary layer of 
the atmosphere. We also discuss the influence of Saharan dust intrusions on the
COVID-19 outbreak observed in early 2020 on the Canary Islands. We deem it both
reasonable and plausible that high PM2.5 concentrations-favored by air
temperature inversions or Saharan dust intrusions-are not only modulating but
even more so boosting severe outbreaks of COVID-19. Moreover, desert dust
events-besides enhancing PM2.5 concentrations-can be a vector for fungal
diseases, thereby exacerbating COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We conclude that
the overburdening of the health services and hospitals as well as the high
over-mortality observed in various regions of Europe in spring 2020 may be linked
to peaks of PM2.5 and likely particular weather situations that have favored the 
spread and enhanced the virulence of the virus. In the future, we recommended to 
monitor not only the prevalence of the virus, but also to consider the occurrence
of weather situations that can lead to sudden, very explosive COVID-19 outbreaks.
