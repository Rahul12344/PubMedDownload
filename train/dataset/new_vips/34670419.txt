The multisystem nature of coronavirus disease 2019 has become increasingly clear 
over the course of the pandemic. Both the neurological and vascular systems are
affected, impacting acute stroke. This impact can be conceptualised as direct and
indirect effects of the disease. The direct effects of coronavirus disease 2019
on stroke are thought to relate to receptor-mediated tissue invasion and the
marked inflammatory response to the presence of the virus. These effects include 
coagulopathies, endotheliitis, systemic inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque
instability, with possibly long-term cardiovascular effects. The indirect effects
impact all aspects of stroke care delivery. These extend far beyond the direct
effects of coronavirus disease 2019, and represent an essential focus for stroke 
systems of care. In this article, we detail the impact of coronavirus disease
2019 on acute stroke.
