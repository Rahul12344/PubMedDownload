Population-based data linkage has a long history in Australia from its beginnings
in Western Australia in the 1970s to the coordinated national data linkage
infrastructure that exists today. This article describes the journey from an idea
to a national data linkage network which has impacts on the health and well-being
of Australians from preventing developmental anomalies to responding to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Many enthusiastic and dedicated people have contributed to
Australia's data linkage capability over the last 50 years. They have managed to 
overcome a number of challenges including gaining stakeholder and community
support; navigating complex legal and ethical environments; establishing
cross-jurisdictional collaborations, and gaining ongoing financial support. The
future is bright for linked data in Australia as the infrastructure built over
the last 50 years provides a firm foundation for further expansion and
development, ensuring that Australia's linked health and human services data
continues to be available to address the evolving challenges of the next half
century.
