The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented restrictions on everyday life.
Unlike lockdown or shelter-in-place measures, the facemask has emerged as an
empowering response to the public spread of the virus, permitting some degree of 
return to prepandemic life-such as school or work-by disrupting transmission that
would otherwise occur. And yet, this utilitarian tool has attracted considerable 
controversy and polarized opinions. This article uses Blumer's adaptation of
symbolic interactionism as a theoretical roadmap to examine the various meanings 
ascribed to the facemask and its usage. We discuss how it is socially perceived
and consider implications for health care providers within the Canadian social
context.
