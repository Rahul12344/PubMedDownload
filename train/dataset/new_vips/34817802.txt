Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a global public health concern due to its
relationship with severe neurological disorders. Non-structural (NS) proteins of 
ZIKV are essential for viral replication, regulatory function, and subversion of 
host responses. NS2B is a membrane protein responsible for the regulation of
viral protease activity. This protein has transmembrane domains critical for the 
localization of viral protease to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and a
hydrophilic domain essential for folding, recruitment, and protease activity.
Therefore, NS2B is considered a cofactor of viral protease which processes viral 
polyprotein and is essential for virus replication, making it an attractive
antiviral drug target. Here, we report the backbone 1H, 15N, 13C resonance
assignments of the full-length NS2B by high-resolution NMR. The backbone
assignment will be necessary for determining the three-dimensional structure and 
backbone dynamics of NS2B, interaction mapping and screening potential of
antiviral drugs against ZIKV and related pathogenic flaviviruses.
