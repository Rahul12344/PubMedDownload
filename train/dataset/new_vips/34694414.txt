The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is relatively unknown. In
this study we report the potential impact of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection on 
pregnancy loss in the first half of pregnancy by comparing the prevalence of the 
infection in a retrospective group of pregnant women with miscarriage (n=62) and 
a prospective control group with no pregnancy loss in the first trimester
(n=218). Of 62 women who had miscarriage, 2 (3.2%) resulted IgM for SARS-CoV-2
negative and IgG seropositive, while of 218 pregnant women, 5 (2.3 %) resulted
IgM for negative and IgG seropositive. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was not
significantly different in the two groups of women, therefore excluding a
significant role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy loss. Therefore, our data
show that SARS-CoV-2 infection within the first trimester does not seem to
predispose to early pregnancy loss and that the impact of asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy appears limited.
