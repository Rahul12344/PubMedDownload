BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is an uncommon arbovirus infection and is
usually asymptomatic in pediatric patients and due to its rarity is not very well
known by clinicians.
CASE: We present a 5-year-old girl admitted to the Pediatric Emergency Service
with fever, vomiting, neck stiffness, walking difficulty and sudden deviation of 
eyes who was diagnosed with a neuroinvasive WNV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmoplegia is an unusual presentation of neuroinvasive WNV and 
there are no published pediatric cases with ophthalmoplegia in the literature.
