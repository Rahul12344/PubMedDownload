Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a major
epidemic threat since the beginning of 2020. Efforts to combat the virus and the 
associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease are being undertaken
worldwide. To facilitate the research on the virus itself, a number of surrogate 
systems have been developed. Here, we report the efficient production of
SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) in insect cells. Contrary to widely used
pseudovirus particles, where only one coronaviral protein is displayed within a
heterologous scaffold, developed VLPs are structurally similar to the native
virus and allow for more throughput studies on the biology of the infection. On
the other hand, being devoid of the viral genome, VLPs are unable to replicate
and thus safe to work with. Importantly, this is the first report showing that
SARS-CoV-2 VLPs can be efficiently produced in insect cells and purified using
scalable affinity chromatography.
