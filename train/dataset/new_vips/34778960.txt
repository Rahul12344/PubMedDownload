Cellular double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (DRBPs) play important roles in the
regulation of innate immune responses and microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. The
current study aimed to understand whether OV20.0, a DRBP of orf virus (ORFV), is 
involved in cellular RNA biogenesis via association with host DRBPs. We found
that OV20.0 interacts with DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8), a subunit
of the miRNA processor complex, and binds to primary- and precursor-miRNA.
Additionally, OV20.0 regulates DGCR8 expression in multiple ways, including
through interaction with the DGCR8 protein and binding to DGCR8 mRNA. Lastly, our
data show that DGCR8 plays an antiviral role against ORFV infection, whereas it
is beneficial for influenza virus propagation, indicating that the underlying
mechanisms could be diverse among different viruses.
