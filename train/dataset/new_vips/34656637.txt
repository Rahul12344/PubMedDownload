The fate of Coronaviruses (CoVs) and in particular SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) has not been completely understood yet, but an adequate 
knowledge on the removal performances in WWTPs could help to prevent waterborne
transmission of the virus that is still under debate. CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 are
discharged from faeces into the sewer network and reach WWTPs within a few hours.
This review presents the fate of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs in the primary,
secondary and tertiary treatments of WWTPs as well as in sludge treatments. The
viral loads decrease progressively along with the treatments from 20 to 3.0E+06
GU/L (Genomic Units/L) in the influent wastewater to concentrations below
2.50E+05 GU/L after secondary biological treatments and finally to negative
concentrations (below detection limit) in disinfected effluents. Reduction of
CoVs is due to (i) natural decay under unfavourable conditions (solids,
microorganisms, temperature) for relatively long hydraulic retention times and
(ii) processes of sedimentation, filtration, predation, adsorption, disinfection.
In primary and secondary settling, due to the hydrophobic properties, a partial
accumulation of CoVs may occur in the separated sludge. In secondary treatment
(i.e. activated sludge) CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 loads can be reduced only by about
one logarithm (∼90%). To enhance this removal, tertiary treatment with
ultrafiltration (Membrane Bioreactors) and chemical disinfection or UV light is
needed. CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 in the sludge (1.2E+04-4.6E+08 GU/L) can be
inactivated significantly in the thermophilic digestion (55 °C), while mesophilic
temperatures (33-37 °C) are not efficient. Additional studies are required to
investigate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in WWTPs, especially in view of
increasing interest in wastewater reclamation and reuse.
