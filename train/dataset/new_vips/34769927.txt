The study aim was to understand the availability of personal protective equipment
(PPE) and the levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout of healthcare workers
(HCWs) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study was an online-based,
cross-sectional survey during July and August 2020. Participants were eligible
from the entire country, and 1290 agreed to participate. The majority of HCWs
were females aged 30-39 years old, working as nurses, and 80% considered PPE to
be available. Twelve percent of respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Half 
of HCWs considered themselves physically tired (52.2%), reported musculoskeletal 
pain or discomfort (54.2%), and perceived moderate-to-high levels of burnout on
at least one of three burnout domains (52.8%). A quarter of HCWs reported anxiety
(26.3%) or depression (28.1%). HCWs reporting not having musculoskeletal pain,
having performed physical activity, and higher scores of available PPE reported
lower scores of anxiety, depression, and burnout. UAE HCWs experienced more
access to PPE and less anxiety, depression, and burnout compared with HCWs in
other countries. Study findings can be used by healthcare organizations and
policymakers to ensure adequate measures are implemented to maximize the health
and wellbeing of HCWs during the current COVID-19 and future pandemics.
