Existing research on individual preparedness in the United States indicates that 
we are generally unprepared for disasters. While there is an abundance of
research on emergency preparedness, there are gaps in our knowledge. For example,
the results of extant research are unclear regarding what factors influence
individual preparedness. The preparedness literature is also limited in the types
of disasters examined and in understanding the timing of preparedness activities.
The current COVID-19 global pandemic provides a tragic but albeit unique
opportunity to address these limitations of previous research and examine
emergency preparedness activities before and immediately following the onset of
the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. This research is further distinctive 
because it examines preparedness activities related to the global pandemic rather
than other types of disasters. Policy and research implications of the findings
are presented.
