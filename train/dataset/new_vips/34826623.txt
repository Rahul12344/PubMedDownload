OBJECTIVES: Highly effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed but variants of concerns are
worrisome, especially B.1.617.2 (Delta) which has rapidly spread across the
world. We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics
in breakthrough infections.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of patients in
Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital 
with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared clinical features, virological
and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike and surrogate virus
neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
RESULTS: Out of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection, 84 received a mRNA
vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 were unvaccinated and 4 received a
non-mRNA. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine-breakthrough group, only
2.8% (2/71) developed severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation compared
to 53.1% (69/130) in the unvaccinated group (p<0.001). Odds of severe COVID-19
following vaccination were significantly lower (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95%CI:
0.015-0.335, p=0.001). PCR cycle threshold values were similar between vaccinated
and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in
vaccinated individuals. Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies
was observed in vaccinated patients, however, these titers were significantly
lower against B.1.617.2 as compared with wildtype vaccine strain.
CONCLUSION: The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and 
severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated
with faster decline in viral RNA load and a robust serological response.
Vaccination remains a key strategy for control of COVID-19 pandemic.
