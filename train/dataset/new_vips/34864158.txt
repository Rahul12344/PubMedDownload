BACKGROUND & AIMS: A strategy to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) virologic
reactivation (HBVr) and clinical reactivation (CR) during direct acting antiviral
(DAA) treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HBV dual infection remains an
unresolved issue.
METHODS: Non-cirrhotic patients with dual HCV/HBV infection were enrolled and
randomly allocated to one of three groups as 12-week DAA alone (Group 1), 12-week
DAA plus 12-week entecavir (Group 2) or 12-week DAA plus 24-week entecavir (Group
3). The entire study duration was 72 weeks. Primary endpoint was the occurrence
of HBVr (defined by an increase of HBV DNA level > 10 folds with quantifiable HBV
DNA at baseline or presence of HBV DNA with prior unquantifiable HBV DNA) and CR 
(defined by serum ALT >2 folds upper limit of normal in addition to HBVr).
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were randomly allocated as 20 patients in Group 1, 16
patients in Group 2, and 20 patients in Group 3. In Group 1, HBV DNA levels rose 
significantly as early as 4 weeks after initiation of DAA and persisted until end
of study. During DAA treatment, HBVr occurred in 50% of Group 1 vs. 0% of Group 2
and 0% of Group 3 (p<0.001), whereas the majority of HBVr in Group 2 and Group 3 
occurred since 12 weeks following cessation of entecavir (cumulative incidence:
93.8% in Group 2 and 94.7% in Group 3). Three patients (5.4%; one in each group) 
exhibited CR at week 48 and did not receive entecavir treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week entecavir is suggested to co-administer with DAA for
HCV/HBV dually infected patients.
