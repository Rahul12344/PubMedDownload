Influenza B viruses (IBVs) are causing an increasing burden of morbidity and
mortality, yet the prevalence of culture-adapted mutations in human seasonal IBVs
are unclear. We collected 368 clinical samples from patients with influenza-like 
illness in Missouri during the 2019-2020 influenza season and recovered 146
influenza isolates including 38 IBV isolates. Of MDCK-CCL34, MDCK-Siat1, and
humanized MDCK (hCK), hCK showed the highest virus recovery efficiency. All
Missourian IBVs belonged to the Victoria V1A.3 lineage, all of which contained a 
three-amino acid deletion on the HA protein and were antigenically distant from
the Victoria lineage IBV vaccine strain used during that season. By comparing
genomic sequences of these IBVs in 31 paired samples, eight cell-adapted
nonsynonymous mutations were identified, with the majority in the RNA polymerase.
Analyses of IBV clinical sample-isolate pairs from public databases further
showed that cell- and egg-adapted mutations occurred more widely in viral
proteins, including the receptor and antibody binding sites on HA. Our study
suggests that hCK is an effective platform for IBV isolation and that
culture-adapted mutations may occur during IBV isolation. As culture-adapted
mutations may affect subsequent virus studies and vaccine development, the
knowledge from this study may help optimize strategies for influenza
surveillance, vaccine strain selection, and vaccine development.
