BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of cervical
cancer. Characteristics of HPV infections, including the HPV genotype and
duration of infection, determine a patient's risk of high-grade lesions. Risk
quantification of cervical lesions caused by different HPV genotypes is an
important component of evaluation of cervical lesion. Data and evidence are
necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenicity of different HPV
genotypes. The present study investigated the clinical characteristics of
patients infected with single human papillomavirus (HPV) 53.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of patients who
underwent cervical colposcopy guided biopsy between October 2015 and January
2021. The clinical outcomes and the follow-up results of the patients with single
HPV53 infection were described.
RESULTS: 82.3% of the initial histological results of all 419 patients with
single HPV53 infection showed negative (Neg). The number of patients with
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, CIN2, CIN3, vaginal intraepithelial
neoplasia (VaIN)1, CIN1 + VaIN1, CIN1 + VaIN2, and CIN2 + VaIN2 was 45, 10, 2, 9,
6, 1, and 1, respectively. Cancer was not detected in any patient. When the
cytology was negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), atypical
squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), we observed a significant difference in the
distribution of histological results (P < 0.05). 95 patients underwent follow-up 
with cytology according to the exclusion criteria. No progression of high-grade
lesions was observed during the follow-up period of 3-34 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The lesion caused by HPV53 infection progressed slowly. The
pathogenicity of a single HPV53 infection was low.
