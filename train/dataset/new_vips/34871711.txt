Methamphetamine (METH), a synthetically produced central nervous system
stimulant, is one of the most illicit and addictive drugs worldwide. Protein
phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1F (PPM1F) has been reported to exert multiple
biological and cellular functions. Nevertheless, the effects of PPM1F and its
neuronal substrates on METH addiction remain unclear. Herein, we first
established a METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) mouse model. We
showed that PPM1F is widely distributed in 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe
nucleus (DRN), and METH treatment decreased the expression of PPM1F in the DRN,
which was negatively correlated with METH-induced CPP behaviors. Knockout of
PPM1F mediated by adeno-associated virus (AAV) in DRN produced enhanced
susceptibility to METH-induced CPP, whereas the overexpression of PPM1F in DRN
attenuated METH-induced CPP phenotypes. The expression levels of Tryptophan
hydroxylase2 (TPH2) and serotonin transporter (SERT) were down-regulated with a
concurrent reduction in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), tryptophan hydroxylase2
(TPH2)-immunoreactivity neurons and 5-HT levels in DRN of PPM1F knockout mice. In
the end, decreased expression levels of PPM1F were found in the blood of METH
abusers and METH-taking mice. These results suggest that PPM1F in DRN 5-HT
neurons regulates METH-induced CPP behaviors by modulating the key components of 
the 5-HT neurotransmitter system, which might be an important pathological gene
and diagnostic marker for METH-induced addiction.
