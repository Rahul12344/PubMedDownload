In the present manuscript, we report the clinical presentation and challenging
diagnostic work-up of a sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patient with confirmed
VV1 subtype and heterozygous 1-octapeptide repeat deletion in the prion protein
gene. The described patient was a 58-year-old woman. Interestingly, most of the
reported patients with the VV1 subtype to date are men with an average age of 44 
years at disease onset. The patient was observed clinically from symptoms onset
until her death 22 months later. This report describes the patient's insidious
clinical evolution and the paraclinical examinations and pathology reports
gathered at different time points of disease progression. Unfortunately, the
absence of typical clinical and paraclinical features of classic sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease made the brain biopsy surgery necessary. This case
report illustrates the diagnostic difficulties posed by the phenotypic
heterogeneity of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and urges clinicians to
consider this diagnosis even in patients who do not fulfil the typical clinical
disease criteria. Furthermore, it highlights the need for real-time
quaking-induced conversion method adaptation for detection of rare sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease subtypes with certain prion protein gene variants.
