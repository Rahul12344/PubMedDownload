Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus (GAS) is an important human
pathogen that can cause severe invasive infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis 
and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The mortality rate of streptococcal toxic
shock syndrome ranges from 20% to 50% in spite of antibiotics administration.
AR-12, a pyrazole derivative, has been reported to inhibit the infection of
viruses, intracellular bacteria, and fungi. In this report, we evaluated the
bactericidal activities and mechanisms of AR-12 on GAS infection. Our in vitro
results showed that AR-12 dose-dependently reduced the GAS growth, and 2.5 Î¼g/mL 
of AR-12 significantly killed GAS within 2 h. AR-12 caused a remarkable reduction
in nucleic acid and protein content of GAS. The expression of heat shock protein 
DnaK and streptococcal exotoxins was also inhibited by AR-12. Surveys of the GAS 
architecture by scanning electron microscopy revealed that AR-12-treated GAS
displayed incomplete septa and micro-spherical structures protruding out of cell 
walls. Moreover, the combination of AR-12 and gentamicin had a synergistic
antibacterial activity against GAS replication for both in vitro and in vivo
infection. Taken together, these novel findings obtained in this study may
provide a new therapeutic strategy for invasive GAS infection.
