Infants' universal hepatitis A virus (HAV) single-dose vaccination has been
highly effective for controlling HAV infection in Argentina, and in other
Latin-American countries that adopted that strategy. Although antibodies wane
over time, this has not been associated with HAV outbreaks or breakthrough
infections, suggesting a relevant role for memory immunity. This study assessed
long term humoral and cellular immune memory response after an average of
12 years follow-up of HAV single-dose vaccination. We selected 81 HAV-single dose
vaccinated individuals from a 2015 study, including 54 with protective (PAL) and 
27 with unprotective antibody levels (UAL) against HAV. Humoral memory response
was assessed by measuring anti-HAV antibody titers at admission in both groups,
and 30 days after a booster dose in the UAL group. Flow cytometry analysis of
peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples stimulated with HAV antigen was
performed in 47/81 individuals (21 with PAL, 26 with UAL) to identify activated
CD4 + memory T cells or CD8 + memory T cells. The results showed that 48/52 (92%)
individuals from UAL group who completed follow up reached protective levels
after booster dose. In the PAL group, anti-HAV Abs waned in 2/27 (7%) individuals
lacking seroprotection, while in 25/27 (93%) Abs remained >10 mUI/mL.
HAV-specific memory CD4 + T cells were detected in 25/47 (53.2%) subjects while
HAV-specific memory CD8 + T cells were observed in 16/47 (34.04%) individuals.
HAV-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were detected in 11/21 (52.4%)
and in 9/21 (42.9%) subjects with PAL and in 14/26 (53.8%) and in 7/26 (26.9%)
individuals with UAL, showing that the presence of memory T-cells was independent
of the level or presence of anti-HAV antibodies. Long-term immunity demonstrated 
in the present work, including or not antibody persistence, suggests that
individuals with waned Ab titers may still be protected and supports the
single-dose HAV strategy.
