BACKGROUNDS: To date, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on people living with
HIV (PLWH) were mainly focused on messenger RNA (mRNA) and adenovirus
vector-based vaccines, and little is known about the effects of inactivated
virus-based vaccine. This study was designed to determine the effects of
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on PLWH.
METHODS: Twenty-four HIV-positive individuals and 24 healthy donors (HD) were
respectively recruited from Malipo Country People's Hospital and community in
Kunming city. Enumeration of lymphocyte and CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells were
evaluated by flow cytometry. Competitive ELISA was used to measure the level of
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibody. Spearman or Pearson correlation analysis
was used to analyze the relationship between laboratory indicators and
neutralization antibodies in PLWH. T-cell responses (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg) and
intracellular expression of cytokines (IL-2 and TNF-α) in CD4 or CD8 were induced
by spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2-S) and further measured by intracellular
staining.
RESULTS: CD4, B cells, CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells in peripheral blood of PLWH are
dramatically decreased in comparison with HD. Importantly, PLWH display
comparable neutralizing antibody positive rate to HD after inoculation with
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, PLWH showed weaker responses to vaccines
exhibited by lower levels of neutralizing antibodies. Correlation analysis shows 
that this is possibly caused by low number of CD4 and B cells. Furthermore,
SARS-2-S-induced Th2 and Th17 responses are also decreased in PLWH, while no
influences on Treg and other cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ) observed.
CONCLUSIONS: PLWH and HD have comparable neutralizing antibodies positive rates, 
but PLWH display weaker responses to inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in
magnitude, which suggests that a booster dose or dose adjustment are required for
HIV-infected individuals, especially for those with lower counts of CD4 T and B
cells.
