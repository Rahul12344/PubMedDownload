BACKGROUND: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emphasized the utility of viral
whole-genome sequencing in the surveillance and control of the pathogen. An
unprecedented ongoing global initiative is producing hundreds of thousands of
sequences worldwide. However, the complex circumstances in which viruses are
sequenced, along with the demand of urgent results, causes a high rate of
incomplete and, therefore, useless sequences. Viral sequences evolve in the
context of a complex phylogeny and different positions along the genome are in
linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, an imputation method would be able to predict 
missing positions from the available sequencing data.
RESULTS: We have developed the impuSARS application, which takes advantage of the
enormous number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, using a reference panel
containing 239,301 sequences, to produce missing data imputation in viral
genomes. ImpuSARS was tested in a wide range of conditions (continuous fragments,
amplicons or sparse individual positions missing), showing great fidelity when
reconstructing the original sequences, recovering the lineage with a 100%
precision for almost all the lineages, even in very poorly covered genomes
(<20%).
CONCLUSIONS: Imputation can improve the pace of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing production 
by recovering many incomplete or low-quality sequences that would be otherwise
discarded. ImpuSARS can be incorporated in any primary data processing pipeline
for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing.
