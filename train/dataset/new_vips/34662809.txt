OBJECTIVE: To examine the mechanisms of Nogo-B (RTN4B) in the protection of
blood-retinal barrier in experimental diabetic retinopathy.
METHODS: The level of Nogo-B in vitreous and plasma samples was detected with
ELISA. Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats with intraperitoneal injection
of streptozotocin. The rats were injected intravitreally with adeno-associated
virus (AAV) for knockdown the expression of Nogo-B in retina or/and as AAV
negative control. The permeability of blood-retinal barrier was detected with
Rhodamine-B-dextran leakage assay. The expressions of Nogo-B, junctional
proteins, inflammatory factors and signaling pathways were examined with Western 
blot and quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Nogo-B expression was significantly upregulated in clinical samples and 
experimental diabetic rat models. Under normal condition, Nogo-B knockdown
resulted in the increased permeability of retinal blood vessels. In diabetic rat 
retinas, the vascular leakage was increased significantly, which was partially
decreased by Nogo-B knockdown through increasing p/t-Src (Tyr529) and p/t-Akt
(Ser473), and decreasing p/t-ERK1/2.
CONCLUSION: Nogo-B was increased in diabetic retinopathy and silencing Nogo-B is 
a promising therapy for diabetic retinopathy.
