The development of effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines is a major move forward
in our global effort to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aims of this study
were (1) to develop an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine named
BIV1-CovIran and (2) to determine the safety and potency of BIV1-CovIran
inactivated vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Infectious virus was isolated
from nasopharyngeal swab specimen and propagated in Vero cells with clear
cytopathic effects in a biosafety level-3 facility using the World Health
Organization's laboratory biosafety guidance related to COVID-19. After
characterisation of viral seed stocks, the virus working seed was scaled-up in
Vero cells. After chemical inactivation and purification, it was formulated with 
alum adjuvant. Finally, different animal species were used to determine the
toxicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. The study showed the safety
profile in studied animals including guinea pig, rabbit, mice and monkeys.
Immunisation at two different doses (3 or 5 μg per dose) elicited a high level of
SARS-CoV-2 specific and neutralising antibodies in mice, rabbits and nonhuman
primates. Rhesus macaques were immunised with the two-dose schedule of 5 or 3 μg 
of the BIV1-CovIran vaccine and showed highly efficient protection against 104
TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 intratracheal challenge compared with the control group.
These results highlight the BIV1-CovIran vaccine as a potential candidate to
induce a strong and potent immune response that may be a promising and feasible
vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
