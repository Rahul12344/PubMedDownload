Tremendous progress has been made to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, effective therapeutic options are still rare. Drug
repurposing and combination represent practical strategies to address this urgent
unmet medical need. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack host
metabolism to facilitate viral proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a 
promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12
published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2
infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM), revealing complicated host
metabolism reprogramming during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We next applied the
GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets
that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. We successfully validated
these targets using published drug and genetic screen data and by performing an
siRNA assay in Caco-2 cells. Further generating and analyzing RNA-sequencing data
of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples, we predicted metabolic targets acting
in combination with remdesivir, an approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. Our study
provides clinical data-supported candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets for future
evaluation, demonstrating host metabolism targeting as a promising antiviral
strategy.
