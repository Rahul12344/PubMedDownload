Due to the drawback of traditional and current diagnostic methods including
serological and molecular assays, the development of the rapid and free-PCR
techniques can be an alternative technique for the human T-cell lymphotropic
virus (HTLV-1) DNA detection sequences. On the other hand, early detection of
HTLV-1 prevents two dangerous diseases including Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
and HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis. The
biosensor-based methods are sensitive techniques that can provide new
opportunities to detect infectious diseases, particularly in the early stage.
This study provides a comparative view among recently designed biosensors for the
detection of HTLV-1.
