BACKGROUND: The main nutritional consequences of COVID-19 include reduced food
intake, hypercatabolism, and rapid muscle wasting. Some studies showed that
malnutrition is a significant problem among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19
infection, and the outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 is strongly associated
with their nutritional status. The purpose of this study was to collect useful
information about the possible elements of nutritional and probiotic therapy in
patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
METHODS: A narrative review of the literature, including studies published up to 
13 September 2021.
RESULTS: Probiotics may support patients by inhibiting the ACE2 receptor, i.e.,
the passage of the virus into the cell, and may also be effective in suppressing 
the immune response caused by the proinflammatory cytokine cascade. In patients' 
diet, it is crucial to ensure an adequate intake of micronutrients, such as
omega-3 fatty acids (at 2-4 g/d), selenium (300-450 μg/d) and zinc (30-50 mg/d), 
and vitamins A (900-700 µg/d), E (135 mg/d), D (20,000-50,000 IU), C (1-2 g/d),
B6, and B12. Moreover, the daily calorie intake should amount to ≥1500-2000 with 
75-100 g of protein.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the treatment of gut dysbiosis involving an adequate
intake of prebiotic dietary fiber and probiotics could turn out to be an
immensely helpful instrument for immunomodulation, both in COVID-19 patients and 
prophylactically in individuals with no history of infection.
