BACKGROUND: Reports of co-circulation of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 
pandemic and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 vary. However, limited information is 
available from developing countries.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the incidence of respiratory viruses in adult
patients with suspected COVID-19 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
STUDY DESIGN: We collected 198 respiratory samples from adult patients
hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 in a single teaching hospital in Kuala
Lumpur in February-May 2020 and tested combined oro-nasopharyngeal swabs with the
NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex) and Allplex RV Essential (Seegene)
assays. Forty-five negative samples further underwent viral metagenomics
analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 198 samples, 74 (37.4%) had respiratory pathogens, including 56
(28.3%) with SARS-CoV-2 and 18 (9.1%) positive for other respiratory pathogens.
There were five (2.5%) SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, all with rhinovirus/enterovirus.
Three samples (6.7%; 3/45) had viruses identified by metagenomics, including one 
case of enterovirus D68 and one of Saffold virus genotype 6 in a patient
requiring ICU care. Most of the COVID-19 patients (91.1%; 51/56) had mild
symptoms but 5.4% (3/56) died.
CONCLUSION: During the early COVID-19 period, common respiratory viruses other
than SARS-CoV-2 only accounted for 9.1% of hospitalization cases with ARI and
co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were rare. Continued surveillance is important to
understand the impact of COVID-19 and its associated public health control
measures on circulation of other respiratory viruses. Metagenomics can identify
unexpected or rare pathogens, such as Saffold virus, which is rarely described in
adults.
