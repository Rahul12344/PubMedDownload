Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is not
always confined to the respiratory system, as it impacts people on a broad
clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to severe systemic manifestations resulting
in death. Further, accumulation of intra-host single nucleotide variants during
prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to emergence of variants of concern
(VOCs). Still, information on virus infectivity and intra-host evolution across
organs is sparse. We report a detailed virological analysis of thirteen
postmortem coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases that provides proof of
viremia and presence of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in extrapulmonary organs
of immunocompromised patients, including heart, kidney, liver, and spleen
(NCT04366882). In parallel, we identify organ-specific SARS-CoV-2 genome
diversity and mutations of concern N501Y, T1027I, and Y453F, while the patient
had died long before reported emergence of VOCs. These mutations appear in
multiple organs and replicate in Vero E6 cells, highlighting their infectivity.
Finally, we show two stages of fatal disease evolution based on disease duration 
and viral loads in lungs and plasma. Our results provide insights about the
pathogenesis and intra-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and show that COVID-19
treatment and hygiene measures need to be tailored to specific needs of
immunocompromised patients, even when respiratory symptoms cease.
