Healthcare professionals have an ethical, medico-legal, and professional
responsibility to report all suspected adverse events following immunization to
relevant national reporting agencies as part of the process of post-marketing
drug safety monitoring. In the US, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) is co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Data from VAERS and other national
and global reporting systems show very low rates of adverse events related to
currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Populations studies have supported the
findings from adverse event reporting systems. The presentation, monitoring, and 
reporting of adverse events related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may have future
applications in vaccine monitoring for several other potential pandemic zoonotic 
infections. This editorial aims to summarize the current understanding of adverse
events from current COVID-19 vaccines from global adverse event reporting
systems, rather than individual case reports or anecdotal reporting in the media.
