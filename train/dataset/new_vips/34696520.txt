The innate immune system is the host's first line of immune defence against any
invading pathogen. To establish an infection in a human host the influenza virus 
must replicate in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. However, there
are several innate immune mechanisms in place to stop the virus from reaching
epithelial cells. In addition to limiting viral replication and dissemination,
the innate immune system also activates the adaptive immune system leading to
viral clearance, enabling the respiratory system to return to normal homeostasis.
However, an overzealous innate immune system or adaptive immune response can be
associated with immunopathology and aid secondary bacterial infections of the
lower respiratory tract leading to pneumonia. In this review, we discuss the
mechanisms utilised by the innate immune system to limit influenza virus
replication and the damage caused by influenza viruses on the respiratory tissues
and how these very same protective immune responses can cause immunopathology.
