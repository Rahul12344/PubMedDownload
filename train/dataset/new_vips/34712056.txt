Objective: To explore the feasibility of treating cirrhosis using a
multidisciplinary team approach (MDT) and to pinpoint the key factors influencing
its implementation.
Methods: The data of 307 patients with decompensated cirrhosis were studied
retrospectively. Patients who received more than two treatment measures were
assigned to the MDT group (n=228), and patients who received symptomatic medical 
drug treatment only were assigned to the traditional treatment group (n=79). The 
follow-up period ranged from 4 to 10 years, and the average follow-up period was 
5.7 years. The results of the biochemical tests for hepatitis B virus
deoxyribonucleic acid, hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid, and autoantibodies to 
liver disease were analyzed.
Results: The differences in gender and Child-Pugh grade of liver function between
the two groups were not statistically significant. The MDT group had obvious
advantages over the traditional treatment group in occupational composition,
etiology composition, 5-year survival rate and annual hospitalization times. The 
leading causes of death in the MDT group, in descending order, were liver cancer,
infection, mesenteric thrombosis, and non-hepatic disease, and, in the medical
treatment group, they were liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection,
and liver cancer. There was a significant statistical difference between the two 
groups (p < 0.05). In the multidisciplinary treatment, etiological treatment was 
the most widely used treatment, accounting for 79.8%, followed by endoscopic
treatment (33.3%), peritoneal drainage and ascites reinfusion (25%), splenectomy 
combined with devascularization (11.4%) and stem cell transplantation and liver
transplantation (1.8%).
Conclusion: An MDT can improve the efficacy and prognosis of patients with
cirrhosis and improve patient compliance. After multi-disciplinary intervention, 
the mortality spectrum of long-term survival patients with cirrhosis changes, and
the mortality rate of liver cancer and non-liver disease increases.
