BACKGROUND: The main objective was to determine the incidence, management, and
outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus nosocomial infection (RSVNI) outbreaks in
neonatal intensive care units.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of RSVNI in 9 databases was conducted from
January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2021, of which the Cochrane Library comprised the
Cochrane central register of controlled trials and the Cochrane database of
systematic reviews. Two hundred and twenty-eight articles were retrieved and 17
were retained. A descriptive analysis was performed, and frequencies are reported
as mean, median, and range where pertinent.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen infants were analyzed and comprised preterms
(88.1%) and those with pre-existing co-morbidities. The estimated proportional
incidence of RSVNI was 23.8% (177/744) infants. Outbreaks were principally
managed by conventional protective measures, neonatal intensive care unit
closure, and visitor restriction. Palivizumab was used to control RSVNI in 10
studies. RSVNI-related mortality was 8.5% (15/177) and 8.0% (7/87) among infants 
where infection control was solely employed.
CONCLUSION: RSVNI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The use
of palivizumab should be a multidisciplinary decision, based on rapidly spreading
infection. Prospective studies are essential to determine the cost-benefit of
palivizumab versus standard prevention control for an RSVNI outbreak.
