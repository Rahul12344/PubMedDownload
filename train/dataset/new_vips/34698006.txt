School lockdowns have been widely used to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
these lockdowns may have a significant negative impact on the lives of young
people. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of closing lower secondary
schools for COVID-19 incidence in 13-15-year-olds in Finland, in a situation
where restrictions and recommendation of social distancing were implemented
uniformly in the entire country. COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the
National Infectious Disease Registry (NIDR) of the Finnish Institute for Health
and Welfare, in which clinical microbiology laboratories report all positive
SARS-CoV-2 tests with unique identifiers in a timely manner. The NIDR is linked
to population data registry, enabling calculation of incidences. We estimated the
differences in trends between areas with both restaurant and lower secondary
school closures and areas with only restaurant closures in different age groups
by using joinpoint regression. We also estimated the differences in trends
between age groups. Based on our analysis, closing lower secondary schools had no
impact on COVID-19 incidence among 13-15-year-olds. No significant changes on
COVID-19 incidence were observed in other age groups either.
