BACKGROUND: Women are among the susceptible groups to Coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19) in Ardabil, north-west of Iran, despite the current global status. The
underlying causes of high incidence and fatality rate of women in Ardabil are not
fully understood. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the healthy behaviours
in women of Ardabil and its relationship with COVID-19 mortality.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to compare the adherence to health
protocols and behaviours with respect to COVID-19 between the infected (261
patients) and healthy (515 persons) women. Health protocols and behaviours such
as using mask, gloves, disinfectants, history of travelling and contacting, and
attending various gatherings and places during the COVID-19 pandemic along with
demographic variables were defined as independent variables, and COVID-19 death
rate was defined as the dependent variable. Multivariable logistic regression
methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality.
RESULTS: Chi-square and Fisher tests showed significant differences between
infected and healthy women in terms of history of contact and traveling
(p < 0.05), wearing mask (p < 0.001), going to work place (p < 0.001), and attend
public gatherings (p = 0.038). Multivariable logistic regression disclosed that
the age group over 80 years: 8.97 times (95% CI 2.27-29.85), women with
underlying chronic diseases: 4.14 times (95% CI 1.61-10.64), and obese women:
3.01 times (95% CI 1.04-6.03) were more likely to die from COVID-19 than other
women.
CONCLUSION: Considering the high incidence and mortality rate in Ardabil women
due to COVID-19 and the corresponding health behavioural factors, special
emphasis should be given to the increase of women awareness on the importance of 
healthy behaviours, diet, and life-style.
