Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging
tick-borne bunyavirus in Asia that causes severe disease. Despite its clinical
importance, treatment options for SFTSV infection remains limited. The SFTSV
glycoprotein Gn plays a major role in mediating virus entry into host cells and
is therefore a potential antiviral target. In this study, we employed an in
silico structure-based strategy to design novel cyclic antiviral peptides that
target the SFTSV glycoprotein Gn. Among the cyclic peptides, HKU-P1 potently
neutralizes the SFTSV virion. Combinatorial treatment with HKU-P1 and the
broad-spectrum viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir exhibited
synergistic antiviral effects in vitro. The in silico peptide design platform in 
this study may facilitate the generation of novel antiviral peptides for other
emerging viruses.
