Lymphatic metastasis is a common clinical symptom in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), the most common Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated head and neck
malignancy. However, the effect of EBV on NPC lymph node (LN) metastasis is still
unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that EBV infection is strongly associated
with advanced clinical N stage and lymphangiogenesis of NPC. We found that NPC
cells infected with EBV promote LN metastasis by inducing cancer-associated
lymphangiogenesis, whereas these changes were abolished upon clearance of EBV
genomes. Mechanistically, EBV-induced VEGF-C contributed to lymphangiogenesis and
LN metastasis, and PHLPP1, a target of miR-BART15, partially contributed to
AKT/HIF1a hyperactivity and subsequent VEGF-C transcriptional activation. In
addition, administration of anti-VEGF-C antibody or HIF1α inhibitors attenuated
the lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis induced by EBV. Finally, we verified the 
clinical significance of this prometastatic EBV/VEGF-C axis by determining the
expression of PHLPP1, AKT, HIF1a, and VEGF-C in NPC specimens with and without
EBV. These results uncover a reasonable mechanism for the EBV-modulated LN
metastasis microenvironment in NPC, indicating that EBV is a potential
therapeutic target for NPC with lymphatic metastasis. IMPLICATIONS: This research
demonstrates that EBV induces lymphangiogenesis in NPC by regulating
PHLPP1/p-AKT/HIF1a/VEGF-C, providing a new therapeutic target for NPC with
lymphatic metastasis.
