The telemedicine system, which has been gradually introduced, has changed
dramatically with the outbreak of COVID-19. Now, with the development of related 
laws and technologies, the introduction of telemedicine will be further
accelerated, and like the advent of smartphones, this will become an unstoppable 
trend of the times. However, just as there are various crimes and corruption
problems in the current health system, the introduction of telemedicine may bring
other problems. Therefore, it is important to anticipate the types of corruption 
or crimes that will occur with the introduction of telemedicine. And based on
these expectations, we will have an opportunity to properly prepare for the
various problems associated with telemedicine.
