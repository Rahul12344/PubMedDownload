Although there have been several case reports and simulation models of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission associated
with air travel, there are limited data to guide testing strategy to minimize the
risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission onboard commercial aircraft. Among
9853 passengers with a negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test
performed within 72 hours of departure from December 2020 through May 2021, five 
(0.05%) passengers with active SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified with rapid
antigen tests and confirmed with rapid molecular test performed before and after 
an international flight from the United States to Italy. This translates to a
case detection rate of 1 per 1970 travelers during a time of high prevalence of
active infection in the United States. A negative molecular test for SARS-CoV-2
within 72 hours of international airline departure results in a low probability
of active infection identified on antigen testing during commercial airline
flight.
