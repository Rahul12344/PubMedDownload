As the first intracellular host factors that directly interact with the genomes
of RNA viruses, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) have a profound impact on the outcome
of an infection. Recent discoveries brought about by new methodologies have led
to an unprecedented ability to peer into the earliest events between viral RNA
and the RBPs that act upon them. These discoveries have sparked a re-evaluation
of current paradigms surrounding RBPs and post-transcriptional gene regulation.
Here, we highlight questions that have bloomed from the implementation of these
novel approaches. Canonical RBPs can impact the fates of both cellular and viral 
RNA during infection, sometimes in conflicting ways. Noncanonical RBPs, some of
which were first characterized via interactions with viral RNA, may encompass
physiological roles beyond viral pathogenesis. We discuss how these RBPs might
discriminate between an RNA of either cellular or viral origin and thus exert
either pro- or antiviral effects-which is a particular challenge as viruses
contain mechanisms to mimic molecular features of cellular RNA.
