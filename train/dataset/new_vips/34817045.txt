OBJECTIVES: Despite higher rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), important
concerns remain when patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis C
virus (HCV) are treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA). Questions
include efficacy, safety, and the magnitude of liver function improvement. Here, 
we aimed to evaluate HCV treatment data in this specific population in Brazil.
METHODS: We included 85 patients with decompensated cirrhosis submitted to HCV
therapy with DAA followed at two academic tertiary centers in the southeastern
region of Brazil.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (92.9%) were Child-Pugh (CP) score B, and six
(7.1%) were CP score C. The mean MELD score was 12.86. The most common treatment 
was sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir±ribavirin for 24 weeks. The overall
intention-to-treat (ITT) SVR rate was 87.4% (74/85) and modified-ITT 96.1%
(74/77). ITT SVR was associated with lower baseline INR values (p=0.029). Adverse
events (AE) occurred in 57.9% (44/76) of patients. Serious AE were reported in
12.8% (10/78), and were related to the presence of hepatic encephalopathy
(p=0.027). SVR was associated with improvement in CP (p<0.0001) and MELD scores
(p=0.021). Among baseline CP score B patients with SVR, 46% (29/63) regressed to 
CP score A. Ascites was independently associated with no improvement in liver
function in patients who achieved SVR (p=0.001; OR:39.285; 95% CI:4.301-258.832).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with decompensated HCV cirrhosis showed a high SVR rate
with interferon-free therapy. Early liver function improvement occurred after
successful HCV eradication. However, long-term follow-up of these patients after 
SVR remains strongly advised.
