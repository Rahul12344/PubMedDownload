Structural racism remains a fundamental reason for persistent health disparities 
in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
highlighted that structural racism persists and negatively impacts the health of 
Black Americans. Despite significant evidence demonstrating the impact of
structural racism on health, there is a lack of evidence explicitly focusing on
kidney health. This scoping review was conducted to analyze the available
evidence to identify the best strategies nephrology nurses can utilize to
dismantle structural racism and improve kidney health in Black Americans. Results
of this scoping review (n = 12) identified significant gaps in the literature
regarding strategies to improve kidney health in Black Americans. There is a need
for future research to understand the effect of structural racism on kidney
health.
