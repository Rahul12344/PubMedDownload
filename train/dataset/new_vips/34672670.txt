Efficacy of pulse steroid therapy in patients critically ill with COVID-19.

Gundogdu O, Demir B, Coskun CO, Ersan I.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of pulse steroid 
therapy administered to patients critically ill with COVID-19 progressing into
severe pneumonia.
METHODS: A total of 600 patients included in this retrospective study were
divided into three groups. Group 1 (control group): 200 patients who did not
receive steroid treatment, Group 2: 200 patients who received dexamethasone 1x8
milligram (mg) or methylprednisolone 1x80 mg, Group 3: (pulse steroid therapy
group): 200 patients who received 1 g methylprednisolone followed by 1x80 mg
methylprednisolone. Demographic and laboratory data were recorded.
RESULTS: Mortality rates in groups 1, 2 and 3 were 77 %, 53.55 %, and 58.5 %,
respectively. The ratios of intubated patients in groups 1, 2 and 3 were 70 %,
45.5 % and 56 %, respectively. The numbers of patients whose Dâ€‘dimer values were 
above 2,250 ng/mL (cut-off value for D-dimer in this study) in groups 2, 1 and 3 
were 65, 107, and 105, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Pulse steroid therapy does not shorten the duration of hospital stay,
does not reduce the need for intubation and increases the risk of thrombosis by
significantly increasing the level of D-dimer among patients critically and
severely ill with COVID-19 (Tab. 4, Fig. 3, Ref. 20) Keywords: COVID-19, pulse
steroid therapy, thrombosis, d-dimer, corticosteroid.
