BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the police force was one of the
institutions that was most exposed to possible infections, in addition to
suffering stressful situations that affect health. This study aims to
independently assess the relationship between demographic, work, and COVID-19
variables, and resilience, engagement, and the perception of health, as well as
to evaluate which variables are more important when predicting health
perceptions.
METHOD: 640 Spanish police officers were evaluated through a cross-sectional
design and online survey.
RESULTS: The perception of the lack of personal protective equipment, believing
that it is easy to become infected with COVID-19, or working as a police officer 
were associated with low levels of engagement and resilience and a worse
perception of health. More years of experience in the police force was associated
with worse health and lower levels of engagement and resilience. Engagement and
resilience would be protective variables of health.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to promote practices related to engagement and
resilience in the police force. The discussion emphasizes that more experienced
police officers demonstrate less engagement and resilience.
