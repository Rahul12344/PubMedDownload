INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the application value of two laboratory
tests in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis 
(EBV-IM) in children.
METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2020, 166 patients with EBV-IM were
included in this study. Two methods were used in the analysis. The results of
both tests were compared and analyzed.
RESULTS: The age of onset of EBV-IM is mainly distributed in the range of 0-6
years, and no difference by gender is observed. The sensitivity and specificity
of EBV testing by PCR were 49.4% and 89.8%, respectively, and the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.714 (0.662-0.762). When using
the immunofluorescence method to detect EBV antibodies, the two indices with the 
highest diagnostic efficacy were low-affinity EBV-CA IgG and EBV-CA IgM, and
their AUC values were 0.798 (0.751-0.840) and 0.663 (0.609-0.713), respectively. 
When combining the two indices for testing, the AUC values of EBV-CA IgM +
low-affinity EBV-CA IgG, EBV-DNA + EBV-CA IgM, and EBV-DNA + low-affinity EBV-CA 
IgG were 0.904(0.867-0.933), 0.768 (0.719-0.812) and 0.963 (0.937-0.981),
respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of the combined EBV-DNA + EBV-CA IgM +
low-affinity EBV-CA IgG test was optimal compared with that of a single index or 
the combination of two indices, with an AUC of 0.999 (0.986-1.000) (P < 0.05),
sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 89.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined immunofluorescence and real-time PCR method has high
sensitivity and specificity and good application value in the clinical diagnosis 
of EBV-IM. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
