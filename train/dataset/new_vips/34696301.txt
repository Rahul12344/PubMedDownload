Background: Italy is considered an area with very low HAV (hepatitis A virus)
endemicity. Currently in Italy the anti-HAV vaccine is recommended only for
specific risk groups and there is no universal vaccination program. The aim of
this study was to assess the level of immunity against hepatitis A in a sample of
children and adolescents from the province of Florence. Methods: A total of 165
sera were collected from subjects aged 1 to 18 years, proportionally selected
according to the general population size and stratified by age and sex. A
qualitative evaluation of anti-HAV antibodies was performed using the
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anamnestic and vaccination status data
were also collected. Results: Our study showed a hepatitis A seroprevalence of
9.1% in the enrolled population. A statistically significant difference in the
prevalence of anti-HAV was found between Italian and non-Italian subjects. About 
half of the population having anti-HAV antibodies was reported to be vaccinated, 
and no cases of hepatitis A were found. Conclusions: The data from our study
confirmed Tuscany as an area with low HAV endemicity and showed that hepatitis A 
seroprevalence is significantly higher in foreign children and adolescents. The
presence of more seropositive subjects than those vaccinated was probably due to 
a natural immunization achieved through a subclinical infection and/or to
underreporting of the surveillance systems.
