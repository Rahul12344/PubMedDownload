BACKGROUND: Dengue, chikungunya and zika infections occur in tropical and
subtropical regions of the world. We describe the utilization of an in-house
nucleic acid test (NAT) targeting all three viruses for febrile returning
travelers in Alberta, Canada.
METHODS: NAT was performed until 40 days from symptom onset or exposure due to
the prolonged duration of zika virus RNA detection. From Sept 1, 2017 to August
31, 2019, 2552 specimens from 1932 patients were tested.
RESULTS: Approximately 2% of patients tested were NAT positive for dengue virus
(n = 42), chikungunya virus (n = 4), and zika virus (n = 1). The majority
presented with fever, myalgia and rash. Regions with the most frequent travel
included SouthEast Asia (68.5%), South America (25%) and the Caribbean (6.5%). Ct
values were stronger (~ 1.5 logs) for patients within 1-3 days following onset of
clinical symptoms than those presenting later. Nineteen patients had urine and
plasma submitted; 5 were positive for both specimens and 2 were positive only for
dengue virus in the urine. Also, Ct values were lower for plasma when compared to
the corresponding urine. RNA was detected until 10 days and 5 days post-exposure 
in plasma and urine respectively for dengue virus.
CONCLUSIONS: Owing to dengue viremia detected beyond the conventional 7 days and 
low levels of circulating zika virus globally, a cutoff of 14 days from symptom
onset to NAT is sufficient to diagnose acute cases. Inclusion of a zoonotic
history form that collects appropriate clinical history results in improved test 
utilization.
