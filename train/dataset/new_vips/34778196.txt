The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an upsurge economic policy
uncertainty (EPU). Study on the time-varying effect of EPU is of substantial
implication for the central bank in implementation of monetary policy. To
empirically investigate the time-varying effect of EPU, the paper considers the
shock of the monetary policy implemented by China's central bank on different
economic variables including interest rate, output gap, and inflationary gap
using the latent threshold time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model
(LT-TVP-VAR Model). Data period is chosen to be January 2015 through April 2021. 
Our findings show that (i) EPU has a significant threshold effect on the shock of
quantitative monetary policy instrument and the shock of price-based monetary
policy, and that the two types of policy are positively correlated; (ii) the
price-based monetary policy instrument has a significant counter-cyclical effect 
on both output gap and inflationary gap; (iii) relative to the quantitative
monetary policy instrument, the price-based monetary policy instrument has a more
significant counter-cyclical effect on output gap; and (iv) a higher level of EPU
is associated with a more significant monetary policy effect on output gap and
inflationary gap.
