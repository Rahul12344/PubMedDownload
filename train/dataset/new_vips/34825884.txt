A novel moderately thermophilic, anaerobic, heterotrophic bacterium (strain
SY095T) was isolated from a hydrothermal vent chimney located on the Southwest
Indian Ridge at a depth of 2730 m. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, motile,
straight to slightly curved rods forming terminal endospores. SY095T was grown at
45-60 °C (optimum 50-55 °C), pH 6.0-7.5 (optimum 7.0), and in a salinity of
1-4.5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.5 %). Substrates utilized by SY095T included
fructose, glucose, maltose, N-acetyl glucosamine and tryptone. Casamino acid and 
amino acids (glutamate, glutamine, lysine, methionine, serine and histidine) were
also utilized. The main end products from glucose fermentation were acetate, H2
and CO2. Elemental sulphur, sulphate, thiosulphate, sulphite, fumarate, nitrate, 
nitrite and Fe(III) were not used as terminal electron acceptors. The predominant
cellular fatty acids were C14 : 0 (60.5%) and C16 : 0 (7.6 %). The main polar
lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylethanolamine, five unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified
aminophospholipids. No respiratory quinones were detected. The chromosomal DNA
G+C content was 30.8 mol%. The results of phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA
gene sequences indicated that SY095T was closely related to Crassaminicella
profunda Ra1766HT (95.8 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity). SY095T exhibited
78.1 % average nucleotide identity (ANI) to C. profunda Ra1766HT. The in silico
DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) value indicated that SY095T shared 22.7 % DNA
relatedness with C. profunda Ra1766HT. On the basis of its phenotypic, genotypic 
and phylogenetic characteristics, SY095T is suggested to represent a novel
species of the genus Crassaminicella, for which the name Crassaminicella
thermophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SY095T (=JCM 34213=MCCC
1K04191). An emended description of the genus Crassaminicella is also proposed.
