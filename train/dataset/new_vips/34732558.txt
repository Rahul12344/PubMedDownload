OBJECTIVES: To calculate the seroprevalence of asymptomatic healthcare workers
(HCWs) in our institution.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among asymptomatic HCWs in a large 
hospital during the peak of the pandemic (from July to August 2020 and followed
them up until February 2021) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We collected the data in a 
Microsoft Word document after collecting a single serum sample for detection of
antibodies from each participant then we compared the results statically in
Microsoft Excel tables.
RESULTS: We enrolled 188 participants and measured their IgG antibodies from
venous blood samples using CLIA. Six (3.2%) had positive antibodies despite being
asymptomatic. Most of these were from non-COVID-19 working areas (4 out of 6),
but all had an exposure with a positive COVID-19 patient at some point in the
preceding 2 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with similar local studies showing low
seroprevalence among HCWs while most positive cases are from non-COVID-19 areas. 
Despite this low seroprevalence, HCWs are still considered a high-risk group;
hence, there is a need to encourage strict implementation and adherence to
infection control measures and vaccination among HCWs, especially when these
measures are relaxed on the national level.
