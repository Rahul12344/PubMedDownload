Introduction: A novel coronavirus virus (2019-nCoV) emerged in China in December 
2019 and achieved a high-risk category by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The initial symptoms included fever, cough, dyspnea, and sore throat. The present
review aims to evaluate the available evidence for the safety and efficacy of
Unani herbal drugs and formulations in the prevention of Wabai Amraz (epidemic
diseases) having resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Sources of data for this paper are classical Unani textbooks, Unani
pharmacopeia of India, Indian Medicinal Plants-An Illustrated Dictionary, and
published articles in various reputed peer-reviewed journals. Collected
information was then critically analyzed.
Results: Despite great efforts, no specific treatment has been discovered for
coronavirus yet. The best choices, therefore, are prevention and management. The 
Unani system of medicine offers health protection during epidemics. Three
important interventions practised during an outbreak are (i) purification of the 
environment by using certain herbal drugs as fumigants which include vinegar
(acetic acid) alone or combined with Ferula foetida Regel; (ii) promotion of
health and immune modulation by using the pharmacopoeial preparations
Khamira-e-Khashkhash and Khamira-e-Marwareed.
Conclusion: Several single drugs, as well as compound formulations, have been
recommended in Unani medicine for the prevention and treatment of infectious
diseases. The pharmacopoeial preparation Tiryaq-e-Nazla has been used for
respiratory catarrhal inflammations and influenza by Hakims of the medieval
period. Scientific research on these drugs reveals the presence of many
pharmacologically active substances possessing significant antiviral,
antipyretic, anti-tussive, and immune-modulatory properties, which can give new
insight into infection and epidemic management.
