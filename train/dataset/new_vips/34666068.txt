Bluetongue virus (BTV) has 27 serotypes with some of them coexisting in different
environments which make its control difficult. Wind-aided midge movement is a
known mechanism in the spread of BTV. However, its effects on the dynamics of
multiple BTV serotypes are not clear. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) and
continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models for two BTV serotypes in an
environment divided into two patches depending on the risk of infection are
formulated and analysed. By approximating the CTMC model with a multitype
branching process, an estimate for the probability of a major outbreak of two BTV
serotypes is obtained. It is shown that without movement a major outbreak occurs 
in the high-risk patch, but with cattle or midge movement it occurs in both
patches. When a major outbreak occurs, numerical simulations of the ODE model
illustrate possible coexistence in both patches if the patches are connected by
midge or cattle movement. Sensitivity analysis, based on the Latin hypercube
sampling method, identified midge mortality and biting rates as being the most
important in determining the magnitude of the probability of a major outbreak.
These results indicate the significance of wind-aided midge movement on the
outbreak and coexistence of multiple BTV serotypes in patchy environments.
