Aujeszky's disease (AD, pseudorabies) is a viral disease of suids caused by Suid 
Herpesvirus 1 (SHV-1) also referred as Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) or
Pseudorabies virus (ADV). Domestic pig and Wild boar (Sus scrofa) are the natural
host, but many species can be infected with ADV. The aim of our study was to
evaluate seroprevalence of AD in wild boar hunted in the Campania Region, during 
the 2016-2017 hunting season. A total of 503 serum samples from wild boars hunted
in the provinces of Campania Region (Southern Italy) were collected and were
tested for antibody against ADV using an AD, blocking ELISA assay. A
Seroprevalence of 23.85% (120/503, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 20.15-27.55) was
found. Gender was not significantly associated with of ADV seropositivity (p >
0.05), while the presence of ADV antibodies was statistically associated with age
(>36-month, p < 0.0001) and location (Avellino, p = 0.0161). Our prevalence
values are like those obtained in 2010 in our laboratory (30.7%), demonstrating a
constant circulation of ADV in the area.
