The second wave of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus
(SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading over the world. Mechanisms behind the flee from
current antivirals are still unclear due to the continuous occurrence of
SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants. Brazil is the world's second-most COVID-19 affected 
country. In the present study, we identified the genomic and proteomic variants
of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We identified 16 different genotypic variants
were found among the 27 isolates. The genotypes of three isolates such as
Bra/1236/2021 (G15), Bra/MASP2C844R2/2020 (G11), and Bra/RJ-DCVN5/2020 (G9) have 
a unique mutant in NSP4 (S184N), 2'O-Mutase (R216N), membrane protein (A2V) and
Envelope protein (V5A). A mutation in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, particularly the change
of Pro-to Leu-at 323 resulted in the stabilization of the structure in
BRA/CD1739-P4/2020. NSP4, NSP5 protein mutants are more virulent in genotype 15
and 16. A fast protein folding rate changes the structural stability and leads to
escape for current antivirals. Thus, our findings help researchers to develop the
best potent antivirals based on the new mutant of Brazilian isolates.
