Numerous studies have reported that CO2 emissions have decreased because of
global lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, previous
estimates of the global CO2 concentration before and after the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic are limited because they are based on energy consumption
statistics or local specific in-situ observations. The aim of the study was to
explore objective evidence for various previous studies that have claimed the
global CO2 concentration decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic. There are two ways to measure the global CO2 concentration: from the
top-down using satellites and the bottom-up using ground stations. We implemented
the time-series analysis by comparing the before and after the inflection point
(first wave of COVID-19) with the long-term CO2 concentration data obtained from 
World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO GAW) and
Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). Measurements from the GOSAT and GAW
global monitoring stations show that the CO2 concentrations in Europe, China, and
the USA have continuously risen in March and April 2020 compared with the same
months in 2019. These data confirm that the global lockdown during the first wave
of the COVID-19 pandemic did not change the vertical CO2 profile at the global
level from the ground surface to the upper layer of the atmosphere. The results
of this study provide an important foundation for the international community to 
explore policy directions to mitigate climate change in the upcoming
post-COVID-19 period.
