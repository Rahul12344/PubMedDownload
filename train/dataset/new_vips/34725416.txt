In this study, we proposed a new data-driven hybrid technique by integrating an
ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), an autoregressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA), with a nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural network
(NARANN), called the EEMD-ARIMA-NARANN model, to perform time series modeling and
forecasting based on the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality data from 28 February 
2020 to 27 June 2020 in South Africa and Nigeria. By comparing the accuracy level
of forecasting measurements with the basic ARIMA and NARANN models, it was shown 
that this novel data-driven hybrid model did a better job of capturing the
dynamic changing trends of the target data than the others used in this work. Our
proposed mixture technique can be deemed as a helpful policy-supportive tool to
plan and provide medical supplies effectively. The overall confirmed cases and
deaths were estimated to reach around 176,570 [95% uncertainty level (UL) 173,607
to 178,476] and 3454 (95% UL 3384 to 3487), respectively, in South Africa, along 
with 32,136 (95% UL 31,568 to 32,641) and 788 (95% UL 775 to 804) in Nigeria on
12 July 2020 using this data-driven EEMD-ARIMA-NARANN hybrid technique. The
contributions of this study include three aspects. First, the proposed hybrid
model can better capture the dynamic dependency characteristics compared with the
individual models. Second, this new data-driven hybrid model is constructed in a 
more reasonable way relative to the traditional mixture model. Third, this
proposed model may be generalized to estimate the epidemic patterns of COVID-19
in other regions.
