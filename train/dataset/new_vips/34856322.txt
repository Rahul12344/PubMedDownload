BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recognition of non-characterized liver nodules (NCLN) prior to
direct acting antivirals (DAA) is associated with increased hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) risk in patients with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). This
risk has not been defined yet in F3/F4 patients in whom NCLN have been ruled-out 
before starting DAA and at sustained virological response (SVR). This study aimed
to estimate HCC incidence in this population.
METHODS: Prospective study including F3/F4 HCV-infected patients, without history
of HCC, and who achieved SVR after DAA. Patients should have an ultrasound
imaging done within 30 days after SVR excluding the presence of HCC/NCLN. All
patients were evaluated every 6-months until developing primary liver-cancer,
death or withdrawal of informed consent. HCC incidence was expressed in
100/patient-years (100PY). Adherence to screening program was calculated every 6 
months for the first 48-months.
RESULTS: 185 (63/122, F3/F4), were included. Among cirrhotics, 92% were
Child-Pugh A and 42.7% had clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH).
Albumin-bilirubin score was 1 and 2 in 84.9% and 15.1% of patients, respectively.
The median clinical and radiologic follow-up was 52.4 months and 48 months,
respectively. Ten patients developed HCC; HCC incidence was 1.46 100PY (CI95%
0.79-2.71) in the whole cohort and 2.24 100PY (CI95% 1.21-4.17) in F4 only and
3.63 100PY (CI95%1.95-6.74) in patients with CSPH. No HCC was registered in F3
patients. Median time between SVR and HCC occurrence was 28.1 months; 12
non-primary liver cancers were also identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with liver cirrhosis without NCLN at SVR remain at risk of 
HCC development. The absence of HCC in F3 patients reinforces their marginal
cancer risk, but prospective studies are needed to exclude them from screening
programs.
LAY SUMMARY: Patients with DAA-cured HCV-related liver cirrhosis without
non-characterized liver nodules at SVR remain at risk of HCC development. The
absence of HCC in F3 before starting DAA in patients without non-characterized
liver nodules at SVR suggests a marginal cancer risk in this population and, if
confirmed in larger prospective studies, will imply to revisit the current
recommendation for HCC screening in this group of patients.
