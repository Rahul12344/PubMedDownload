Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID19) has emerged as a global medical emergency in 
the contemporary time. The spread scenario of this pandemic has shown many
variations. Keeping all this in mind, this article is written after various
studies and analysis on the latest data on COVID19 spread, which also includes
the demographic and environmental factors. After gathering data from various
resources, all data is integrated and passed into different Machine Learning
Models in order to check its appropriateness. Ensemble Learning Technique, Random
Forest, gives a good evaluation score on the tested data. Through this technique,
various important factors are recognized and their contribution to the spread is 
analyzed. Also, linear relationships between various features are plotted through
the heat map of Pearson Correlation matrix. Finally, Kalman Filter is used to
estimate future spread of SARS-Cov-2, which shows good results on the tested
data. The inferences from the Random Forest feature importance and Pearson
Correlation gives many similarities and few dissimilarities, and these techniques
successfully identify the different contributing factors. The Kalman Filter gives
a satisfying result for short term estimation, but not so good performance for
long term forecasting. Overall, the analysis, plots, inferences and forecast are 
satisfying and can help a lot in fighting the spread of the virus.
