After almost two years from its first evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic continues
to afflict people worldwide, highlighting the need for multiple antiviral
strategies. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) is a recognized promising
target for the development of effective drugs. Because single target inhibition
might not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, multi
enzymatic-based therapies may provide a better strategy. Here we present a
structural and biochemical characterization of the binding mode of MG-132 to both
the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and to the human Cathepsin-L, suggesting thus an
interesting scaffold for the development of double-inhibitors. X-ray diffraction 
data show that MG-132 well fits into the Mpro active site, forming a covalent
bond with Cys145 independently from reducing agents and crystallization
conditions. Docking of MG-132 into Cathepsin-L well-matches with a covalent
binding to the catalytic cysteine. Accordingly, MG-132 inhibits Cathepsin-L with 
nanomolar potency and reversibly inhibits Mpro with micromolar potency, but with 
a prolonged residency time. We compared the apo and MG-132-inhibited structures
of Mpro solved in different space groups and we identified a new apo structure
that features several similarities with the inhibited ones, offering interesting 
perspectives for future drug design and in silico efforts.
