During the European emergence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in 2011, examination
of Culicoides spp. showed that SBV infected midges were present across Denmark.
However, SBV associated malformations in ruminant species have not been reported 
in Denmark. In April 2021, seven calves with severe congenital generalized
arthrogryposis and reduced body weight originating from a narrow region of the
Jutlandic peninsula were submitted for examination. Analysis of fetal brain
tissue for SBV viral RNA and pleural effusion for fetal anti-SBV antibodies
identified SBV as the cause of the congenital syndrome. Backwards calculation
from the calving dates indicated the occurrence of an unnoticed emergence of SBV 
in Denmark from early August 2020 and during the late summer and autumn. As SBV
associated malformations may lead to severe dystocia requiring fetotomy or
Cesarean section, veterinarians performing obstetric intervention are first line 
personnel in recognition of SBV emergence in domestic ruminants. This article is
