OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of reports of symptoms of COVID-19 among
individuals with and without antibodies and identify those with greater
capability to predict the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: The study uses data collected in phases 5 to 8 of Epicovid-19-RS. The
presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by a rapid test. The
occurrence of cough, fever, palpitations, sore throat, difficulty breathing,
changes in taste and smell, vomiting, diarrhea, body pain, shaking, and headache 
since March 2020 was also evaluated. Then, the capability to predict the
evaluated symptoms concerning the presence of antibodies was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 18,000 individuals were interviewed and 181 had antibodies
against COVID-19 in phases 5 to 8. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals was
19.9% among participants with antibodies and 49.7% among those without
antibodies. All symptoms were reported more frequently by individuals with
antibodies. The division of the prevalence of symptoms among individuals with
antibodies by the prevalence among individuals without antibodies showed the
following prevalence ratios: for changes in smell or taste (9.1), fever (4.2),
tremors (3.9), breathing difficulty (3.2) and cough (2.8 times). Anosmia and
fever were the symptoms with a greater capability to predict the presence of
antibodies.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of symptoms was higher among individuals with
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals was
low. Altered smell or taste and fever were the symptoms that most predict the
presence of antibodies. These results can help to identify probable cases,
contributing to the clinical diagnosis and screening of patients for testing and 
isolation guidance in positive cases, especially in scenarios of the scarcity of 
diagnostic COVID-19 tests.
