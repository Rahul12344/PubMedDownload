Skin punch biopsy was donated by a healthy 51-year-old Caucasian male and the
dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed into human induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC) lines by using non-integrative Sendai viruses expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4
and c-MYC. Three iPSC lines (NUIGi046-A, NUIGi046-B, NUIGi046-C) highly expressed
the pluripotent markers and were capable of differentiating into cells of
endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal origin. These iPSCs can be offered as
controls and in combination with genome-editing and three-dimensional (3D)
system. They may be used for human disease modelling and drug screening.
