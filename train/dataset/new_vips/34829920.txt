SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in population worldwide for the past year and a
half, and thus a vast amount of scientific literature has been produced in order 
to study the biology of the virus and the pathophysiology of COVID-19, as well as
to determine the best way to prevent infection, treat the patients and eliminate 
the virus. SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor is the key initiator of
COVID-19. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect various types of cells requires
special attention to be given to the cardiovascular system, as it is commonly
affected. Thorough diagnostics and patient monitoring are beneficial in reducing 
the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and to ensure the most favorable outcomes
for the infected patients, even after they are cured of the acute disease. The
multidisciplinary nature of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic requires
careful consideration from the attending clinicians, in order to provide fast and
reliable treatment to their patients in accordance with evidence-based medicine
principles. In this narrative review, we reviewed the available literature on
cardiovascular implications of COVID-19; both the acute and the chronic.
