School reopening during COVID-19 can be a particularly stressful transition for
many adolescents. However, little is known about the impact of parent-child
relationships on adolescents' mental health during this transition. Using a
2-wave longitudinal design, this research examined the role of parent-child
conflict and intimacy in adolescents' psychological distress after school
reopening. Immediately before school reopening, 879 Chinese adolescents (mean age
= 13.14 years, 51% girls) reported on their parent-child conflict and intimacy.
They also reported on their depressive symptoms and anger problems before and 3
months after school reopening. Youth who reported higher levels of parent-child
conflict and lower levels of parent-child intimacy before school reopening were
more likely to show increased depressive symptoms and anger problems over time.
Moreover, the moderating role of parent-child conflict and intimacy in the link
between youth's perceived stress toward school reopening and psychological
distress was investigated. Specifically, parent-child conflict moderated the
impact of youth's perceived stress on their psychological distress, such that
greater perceived stress was only linked with more psychological distress over
time in families with higher levels of parent-child conflict, but not in families
with lower levels of parent-child conflict. Taken together, the findings
highlight the important role of parent-child relationships in shaping
adolescent's mental health as they return to school, which provides key insights 
into reducing adolescents' psychological distress during the transition of school
reopening in COVID-19 pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all
