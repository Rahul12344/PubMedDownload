BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was linked to depression 
incidence, although the results were limited and inconsistent.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of long-term air pollution exposure on
depression risk prospectively in China.
METHODS: The present study used data from Yinzhou Cohort on adults without
depression at baseline, and followed up until April 2020. Two-year moving average
concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), ≤10 μm
(PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured using land-use regression (LUR)
models for each participant. Depression cases were ascertained using the Health
Information System (HIS) of the local health administration by linking the unique
identifiers. We conducted Cox regression models with time-varying exposures to
estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of
depression with each pollutant, after adjusting for a sequence of individual
covariates as demographic characteristics, lifestyles, and comorbidity. Besides, 
physical activity, baseline potential depressive symptoms, cancer status,
COVID-19 pandemic, different outcome definitions and air pollution exposure
windows were considered in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Among the 30,712 adults with a mean age of 62.22 ± 11.25, 1024 incident 
depression cases were identified over totaling 98,619 person-years of
observation. Interquartile range increments of the air pollutants were associated
with increased risks of depression, and the corresponding HRs were 1.59 (95%CI:
1.46, 1.72) for PM2.5, 1.49 (95%CI: 1.35, 1.64) for PM10 and 1.58 (95%CI: 1.42,
1.77) for NO2. Subgroup analyses suggested that participants without taking any
protective measures towards air pollution were more susceptible. The results
remained robust in all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was identified as a risk
factor for depression onset. Strategies to reduce air pollution are necessary to 
decrease the disease burden of depression.
