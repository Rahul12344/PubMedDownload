Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
poses a severe challenge to healthcare and is a significant public health issue
worldwide. This study intends to examine the change in the awareness level of HIV
among adolescents. Furthermore, this study examined the factors associated with
the change in awareness level on HIV-related information among adolescents over
the period. Data used for this study were drawn from Understanding the lives of
adolescents and young adults, a longitudinal survey on adolescents aged 10-19 in 
Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The present study utilized a sample of 4421 and 7587
unmarried adolescent boys and girls, respectively aged 10-19 years in wave-1 and 
wave-2. Descriptive analysis and t-test and proportion test were done to observe 
changes in certain selected variables from wave-1 (2015-2016) to wave-2
(2018-2019). Moreover, random effect regression analysis was used to estimate the
association of change in HIV awareness among unmarried adolescents with household
and individual factors. The percentage of adolescent boys who had awareness
regarding HIV increased from 38.6% in wave-1 to 59.9% in wave-2. Among adolescent
girls, the percentage increased from 30.2 to 39.1% between wave-1 & wave-2. With 
the increase in age and years of schooling, the HIV awareness increased among
adolescent boys ([Coef: 0.05; p < 0.01] and [Coef: 0.04; p < 0.01]) and girls
([Coef: 0.03; p < 0.01] and [Coef: 0.04; p < 0.01]), respectively. The adolescent
boys [Coef: 0.06; p < 0.05] and girls [Coef: 0.03; p < 0.05] who had any mass
media exposure were more likely to have an awareness of HIV. Adolescent boys'
paid work status was inversely associated with HIV awareness [Coef: - 0.01;
p < 0.10]. Use of internet among adolescent boys [Coef: 0.18; p < 0.01] and girls
[Coef: 0.14; p < 0.01] was positively associated with HIV awareness with
reference to their counterparts. There is a need to intensify efforts in ensuring
that information regarding HIV should reach vulnerable sub-groups, as outlined in
this study. It is important to mobilize the available resources to target the
less educated and poor adolescents, focusing on rural adolescents.
