COVID-19 spread worldwide after its outbreak in December 2019. This review paper 
aims to educate the readers regarding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and detection tools
and the issues experienced by researchers. We identify on-the-horizon
point-of-care diagnostic tests and inspire scholars to develop their innovations 
past conception. It will also effectively avoid potential pandemics to establish 
plug-and-play diagnostic information to handle the SARS infection. The authors
agree that arbitrary-access, interconnected systems with flexible functionality
accessible at the point-of-care, would enable fast and precise diagnosis and
tracking.
