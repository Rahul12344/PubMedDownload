Diabetic foot disease (DFD) is a common and serious complication for diabetes and
is characterized with impaired angiogenesis. In addition to the well-defined role
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A and its defect in the
pathogenesis of DFD, another VEGF family member, placental growth factor (PlGF), 
was also recently found to alter expression pattern in the DFD patients with
undetermined mechanisms. This question was thus addressed in the current study.
We detected attenuated PlGF upregulation in a mouse DFD model. In addition, the
major cell types at the wound to express the unique PlGF receptor, VEGF receptor 
1 (VEGFR1), were macrophages and endothelial cells. To assess how PlGF regulates 
DFD-associated angiogenesis, we injected recombinant PlGF and depleted VEGF1R
specifically in macrophages by local injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)
carrying siRNA for VEGFR1 under a macrophage-specific CD68 promoter. We found
that the angiogenesis and recovery of the DFD were both improved by PlGF
injection. The PlGF-induced improvement in angiogenesis and the recovery of skin 
injury were largely attenuated by macrophage-specific depletion of VEGF1R, likely
resulting from reduced macrophage number and reduced M2 polarization. Together,
our data suggest that reduced PlGF compromises angiogenesis in DFD at least
partially through macrophages.
