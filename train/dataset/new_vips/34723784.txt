It is widely recognized that pathogens can be transmitted across the placenta
from mother to foetus. Recent re-evaluation of metagenomic studies indicates that
the placenta has no unique microbiome of commensal bacteria. However, viral
transmission across the placenta, including transmission of DNA viruses such as
the human herpesviruses, is possible. A fuller understanding of which DNA virus
sequence can be found in the placenta is required. We employed a metagenomic
analysis to identify viral DNA sequences in placental metagenomes from full-term 
births (20 births), pre-term births (13 births), births from pregnancies
associated with antenatal infections (12 births) or pre-term births with
antenatal infections (three births). Our analysis found only a small number of
DNA sequences corresponding to the genomes of human herpesviruses in four of the 
48 metagenomes analysed. Therefore, our data suggest that DNA virus infection of 
the placenta is rare and support the concept that the placenta is largely free of
pathogen infection.
