BACKGROUND: Vector-borne pathogens must survive and replicate in the hostile
environment of an insect's midgut before successful dissemination. Midgut
microbiota interfere with pathogen infection by activating the basal immunity of 
the mosquito and by synthesizing pathogen-inhibitory metabolites.
METHODS: The goal of this study was to assess the influence of Zika virus (ZIKV) 
infection and increased temperature on Aedes albopictus midgut microbiota. Aedes 
albopictus were reared at diurnal temperatures of day 28 °C/night 24 °C (L) or
day 30 °C/night 26 °C (M). The mosquitoes were given infectious blood meals with 
2.0 × 108 PFU/ml ZIKV, and 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on midguts at 7 days
post-infectious blood meal exposure.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that Elizabethkingia anophelis albopictus was
associated with Ae. albopictus midguts exposed to ZIKV infectious blood meal. We 
observed a negative correlation between ZIKV and E. anophelis albopictus in the
midguts of Ae. albopictus. Supplemental feeding of Ae. albopictus with E.
anophelis aegypti and ZIKV resulted in reduced ZIKV infection rates. Reduced
viral loads were detected in Vero cells that were sequentially infected with E.
anophelis aegypti and ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), or chikungunya virus (CHIKV).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the influence of ZIKV infection and
temperature on the Ae. albopictus microbiome along with a negative correlation
between ZIKV and E. anophelis albopictus. Our results have important implications
for controlling vector-borne pathogens.
