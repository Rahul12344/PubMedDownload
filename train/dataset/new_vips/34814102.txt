Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end
of 2019 and caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Basic and
clinical investigations indicate that severe forms of COVID-19 are due in part to
dysregulated immune responses to virus infection. The innate immune system is the
first line of host defense against most virus infections, with pathogen
recognition receptors detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein components and
initiating pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. Notwithstanding this
response, SARS-CoV-2 proteins evade, inhibit, and skew innate immune signaling
early in infection. In this review, we highlight the components of cell-based
recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanisms employed by the virus to
modulate these innate immune host defense pathways.
