In vitro assembly and evaluation of Nora virus VLPs.

Licking-Murray KD, Carlson DJ, Sowle R, Carlson KA.

Nora virus is a RNA picorna-like virus that produces a persistent infection in
Drosophila melanogaster. The genome is approximately 12,300 bases and is divided 
into four open reading frames (ORFs). Structurally, there are four important
viral proteins: VP3, VP4A, VP4B, and VP4C. Three proteins (VP4A, VP4B, and VP4C) 
form the virion's capsid and are encoded in ORF 4, which produces a polyprotein
that is post-translationally cleaved. The fourth protein (VP3) is encoded in ORF 
3 and it is hypothesized to play a role in virion stability. The genes for these 
proteins were individually cloned into Escherichia coli, expressed, and the
proteins were purified. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were assembled in vitro by
mixing the proteins together in different combinations and measured via electron 
microscopy. Assemblies that contained VP4A and/or VP3 created VLPs with similar
sizes to purified empty Nora virus capsids, potentially indicating that VP4A
and/or VP3 are vital for Nora virus capsid structure, assembly, and/or stability.
Not only does this study provide insight into the role of Nora virus proteins,
but it may also lead to a deeper understanding of how Nora virus or other
picorna-like viruses undergo assembly.Â  Keywords: RNA viruses, Nora virus,
picorna-like virus, virus-like particles, capsid assembly.
