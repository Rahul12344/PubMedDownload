OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed restrictions 
on people's social behavior. However, there is limited evidence regarding the
relationship between changes in social participation and depressive symptom onset
among older adults during the pandemic. We examined the association between
changes in social participation and the onset of depressive symptoms among
community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: This was a longitudinal study.
SETTING: Communities in Minokamo City, a semi-urban area in Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: We recruited community-dwelling older adults aged â‰¥ 65 years using 
random sampling. Participants completed a questionnaire survey at baseline (March
2020) and follow-up (October 2020).
MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Two-Question Screen.
Based on their social participation status in March and October 2020,
participants were classified into four groups: "continued participation,"
"decreased participation," "increased participation," and "consistent
non-participation."
RESULTS: A total of 597 older adults without depressive symptoms at baseline were
analyzed (mean age = 79.8 years; 50.4% females). Depressive symptoms occurred in 
20.1% of the participants during the observation period. Multivariable Poisson
regression analysis showed that decreased social participation was significantly 
associated with the onset of the depressive symptoms, compared to continued
participation, after adjusting for all covariates (incidence rate ratio = 1.59,
95% confidence interval = 1.01-2.50, p = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: Older adults with decreased social participation during the COVID-19 
pandemic demonstrated a high risk of developing depressive symptoms. We recommend
that resuming community activities and promoting the participation of older
adults, with sufficient consideration for infection prevention, are needed to
maintain mental health among older adults.
