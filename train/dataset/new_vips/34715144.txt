AIMS: Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is an etiological agent of hand foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) and has the potential to cause severe neurological infections in
children. L-SP40 peptide was previously known to inhibit EV-A71 by prophylactic
action. This study aimed to identify the mechanism of inhibition in
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and in vivo therapeutic potential of L-SP40 peptide
in a murine model.
MAIN METHODS: A pull-down assay was performed to identify the binding partner of 
the L-SP40 peptide. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays with the
L-SP40 peptide were employed to confirm the receptor partner in RD cells. The
outcomes were validated using receptor knockdown and antibody blocking assays.
The L-SP40 peptide was further evaluated for the protection of neonatal mice
against lethal challenge by mouse-adapted EV-A71.
KEY FINDINGS: The L-SP40 peptide was found to interact and co-localize with
nucleolin, the key attachment receptor of Enteroviruses A species, as
demonstrated in the pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays.
Knockdown of nucleolin from RD cells led to a significant reduction of 3.5 logs
of viral titer of EV-A71. The L-SP40 peptide demonstrated 80% protection of
neonatal mice against lethal challenge by the mouse-adapted virus with a drastic 
reduction in the viral loads in the blood (~4.5 logs), skeletal muscles (1.5
logs) and brain stem (1.5 logs).
SIGNIFICANCE: L-SP40 peptide prevented severe hind limb paralysis and death in
suckling mice and could serve as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral candidate
to be further evaluated for safety and potency in future clinical trials against 
EV-A71.
