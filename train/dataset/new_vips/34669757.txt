The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically shaped higher education
and seen the distinct rise of e-learning as a compulsory element of the modern
educational landscape. Accordingly, this study highlights the factors which have 
influenced how students perceive their academic performance during this emergency
changeover to e-learning. The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of
10,092 higher education students from 10 countries across 4 continents during the
pandemic's first wave through an online survey. A structural equation model
revealed the quality of e-learning was mainly derived from service quality, the
teacher's active role in the process of online education, and the overall system 
quality, while the students' digital competencies and online interactions with
their colleagues and teachers were considered to be slightly less important
factors. The impact of e-learning quality on the students' performance was
strongly mediated by their satisfaction with e-learning. In general, the model
gave quite consistent results across countries, gender, study fields, and levels 
of study. The findings provide a basis for policy recommendations to support
decision-makers incorporate e-learning issues in the current and any new similar 
circumstances.
