The treatment of viral infections remains challenging, in particular in the face 
of emerging pathogens. Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs could potentially be used
as a first line of defense. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA
viruses serves as a logical target for drug discovery and development efforts.
Herein we discuss compounds that target RdRp of poliovirus, hepatitis C virus,
influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and the growing data on
coronaviruses. We focus on nucleotide analogs and mechanisms of action and
resistance.
