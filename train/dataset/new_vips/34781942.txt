BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) cannot eradicate HIV-1
from the body due to the establishment of persisting viral reservoirs which are
not affected by therapy and reinitiate new rounds of HIV-1 replication after
treatment interruption. These HIV-1 reservoirs mainly comprise long-lived resting
memory CD4+ T cells and are established early after infection. There is a high
variation in the size of these viral reservoirs among virally suppressed
individuals. Identification of host factors that contribute to or can explain
this observed variation could open avenues for new HIV-1 treatment strategies.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL)
analysis to probe functionally relevant genetic variants linked to levels of
cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 DNA, CA HIV-1 RNA, and RNA:DNA ratio in CD4+ T cells
isolated from blood from a cohort of 207 (Caucasian) people living with HIV-1
(PLHIV) on long-term suppressive antiretroviral treatment (median = 6.6 years).
CA HIV-1 DNA and CA HIV-1 RNA levels were measured with corresponding droplet
digital PCR (ddPCR) assays, and genotype information of 522,455 single-nucleotide
variants was retrieved via the Infinium Global Screening array platform.
RESULTS: The analysis resulted in one significant association with CA HIV-1 DNA
(rs2613996, P < 5 × 10-8) and two suggestive associations with RNA:DNA ratio
(rs7113204 and rs7817589, P < 5 × 10-7). Then, we prioritized PTDSS2, IRF7, RNH1,
and DEAF1 as potential HIV-1 reservoir modifiers and validated that higher
expressions of IRF7 and RNH1 were accompanied by rs7113204-G. Moreover, RNA:DNA
ratio, indicating relative HIV-1 transcription activity, was lower in PLHIV
carrying this variant.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented data suggests that the amount of CA HIV-1 DNA and
RNA:DNA ratio can be influenced through PTDSS2, RNH1, and IRF7 that were anchored
by our genome-wide association analysis. Further, these observations reveal
potential host genetic factors affecting the size and transcriptional activity of
HIV-1 reservoirs and could indicate new targets for HIV-1 therapeutic strategies.
