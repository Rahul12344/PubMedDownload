BACKGROUND: Improving the availability and usability of data and analytical tools
is a critical precondition for further advancing modern biological and biomedical
research. For instance, one of the many ramifications of the COVID-19 global
pandemic has been to make even more evident the importance of having
bioinformatics tools and data readily actionable by researchers through
convenient access points and supported by adequate IT infrastructures. One of the
most successful efforts in improving the availability and usability of
bioinformatics tools and data is represented by the Galaxy workflow manager and
its thriving community. In 2020 we introduced Laniakea, a software platform
conceived to streamline the configuration and deployment of "on-demand" Galaxy
instances over the cloud. By facilitating the set-up and configuration of Galaxy 
web servers, Laniakea provides researchers with a powerful and highly
customisable platform for executing complex bioinformatics analyses. The system
can be accessed through a dedicated and user-friendly web interface that allows
the Galaxy web server's initial configuration and deployment.
RESULTS: "Laniakea@ReCaS", the first instance of a Laniakea-based service, is
managed by ELIXIR-IT and was officially launched in February 2020, after about
one year of development and testing that involved several users. Researchers can 
request access to Laniakea@ReCaS through an open-ended call for use-cases. Ten
project proposals have been accepted since then, totalling 18 Galaxy on-demand
virtual servers that employ ~ 100 CPUs, ~ 250 GB of RAM and ~ 5 TB of storage and
serve several different communities and purposes. Herein, we present eight use
cases demonstrating the versatility of the platform.
CONCLUSIONS: During this first year of activity, the Laniakea-based service
emerged as a flexible platform that facilitated the rapid development of
bioinformatics tools, the efficient delivery of training activities, and the
provision of public bioinformatics services in different settings, including food
safety and clinical research. Laniakea@ReCaS provides a proof of concept of how
enabling access to appropriate, reliable IT resources and ready-to-use
bioinformatics tools can considerably streamline researchers' work.
