INTRODUCTION: This study was performed to determine the clinical outcomes of
patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 discharged from the emergency department.
METHODS: The present descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed
on 400 patients discharged with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from the emergency
departments of hospitals affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in
the time period of 21 March-21 June, 2020. The disease characteristics and
demographic data were collected by phone calls during the first, third, and
fourth weeks using a researcher-made questionnaire. Finally, the data were
analyzed by univariate logistic regression and cross-tabulation using the IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.
RESULTS: In the first week of follow-up, 23(5.8%) patients died, of whom seven
patients were female and 16 were male (mean age of death: 70.73±3.27). Out of 41 
(10.3%) patients with underlying diseases, 7 (17.1%) died; but out of 359 (89.8%)
cases with no history of disease only 16 (4.5%) died. The risk of death in
subjects with a history of underlying diseases was 3.27 times higher than those
without a history of disease (P = 0.02) (OR = 3.27, 95% CI, 1.20-8.87); and this 
risk was 1.41 times higher in patients with more family members (P = 0.04) (OR = 
1.41, 95% CI, 1.01-1.97). Furthermore, 81 (20.3%) patients had spread the virus
to others in their households and disregarded hygiene guidelines such as washing 
hands, keeping social distancing, and wearing face masks after discharge. In
addition, family members of these patients were 16.37 times more likely to be
infected than patients who followed the protocols (P ≤ 0.001) (OR = 16.37, 95%
CI, 9.10-29.45).
CONCLUSION: Since our findings showed that mortality rate is high in the first
week after patients' referral to the emergency departments, the health status of 
infected people should be carefully monitored daily in this period.
