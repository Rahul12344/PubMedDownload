BACKGROUND: The hygiene hypothesis posits that microbial exposure reduces risk of
asthma and other respiratory-related diseases. Helicobacter pylori and hepatitis 
A virus (HAV) are common fecal-oral infections. Our study aimed to examine
associations of seropositivity to these agents with asthma in the Hispanic
Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).
METHODS: A total of 12,471 HCHS/SOL participants with baseline data on
self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma, and antibodies anti-H. pylori and
anti-HAV were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable logistic
regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals for the overall associations of seropositivity to each agent with
asthma. Analyses were also stratified by Hispanic/Latino background. Effect
modification by smoking status and nativity were tested. An analysis restricted
to individuals with spirometry-defined chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) was also considered.
RESULTS: The weighted overall prevalence of asthma was 16.6%. The weighted
seroprevalence of H. pylori was 56.6% and of HAV was 76.6%, and they
significantly differed by Hispanic/Latino background. After accounting for age,
sex, education and other key confounders, we found no associations between H.
pylori or HAV seropositivity with asthma (with and without COPD), either for all 
individuals combined or for any of the six specific backgrounds. There were no
significant interactions by smoking and nativity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings did not provide support for the role of H. pylori or
HAV, as evidence of the hygiene hypothesis in asthma among the large and diverse 
Hispanic/Latino populations of the HCHS/SOL. Trial registration NCT02060344.
