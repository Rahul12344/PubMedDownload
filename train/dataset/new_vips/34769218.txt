Since the COVID-19 outbreak was acknowledged by the WHO on 30 January 2020, much 
research has been conducted to unveil various features of the responsible
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Different rates of contagion in adults, children, and pregnant 
women may guide us to understand the underlying infection conditions of COVID-19.
In this study, we first provide a review of recent reports of COVID-19 clinical
outcomes in children and pregnant women. We then suggest a mechanism that
explains the curious case of COVID-19 in children/pregnant women. The unique stem
cell molecular signature, as well as the very low expression of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the lower ACE/ACE2 ratio in stem cells of
children/pregnant women compared to adults might be the cause of milder symptoms 
of COVID-19 in them. This study provides the main molecular keys on how stem
cells can function properly and exert their immunomodulatory and regenerative
effects in COVID-19-infected children/pregnant women, while failing to replicate 
their role in adults. This can lay the groundwork for both predicting the pattern
of spread and severity of the symptoms in a population and designing novel stem
cell-based treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19.
