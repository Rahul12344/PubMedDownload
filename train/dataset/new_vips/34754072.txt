Populist nationalist attacks on health and human rights have been increasing
throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These attacks may be used to divert attention
from the government's inability to control the virus, to deflect blame, or even
to consolidate power. Authoritarian governments have increased the rhetoric of
nationalism, created bogus enemies and alternative narratives, increased the
authority of security forces, and banned democratic demonstrations. In this
article, we discuss how the Turkish government has hidden the truth about the
extent of the disease, spent considerable effort on polishing its own image,
promoted the notion of Western jealousy, and fabricated a host of scapegoats to
blame for its own failure to protect its people from the ravages of this
crippling epidemic.
