OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess safety and adverse events associated with 
intraperitoneal Olvi-Vec virotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant or
refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC). Secondary objectives included objective
response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 and progression-free survival (PFS).
METHODS: Olvi-Vec is a modified vaccinia virus that causes oncolysis and immune
activation. An open-label phase 1b trial using a 3 + 3 dose escalation was
conducted. Intraperitoneal Olvi-Vec was given as monotherapy in two consecutive
daily doses. Translational analyses included anti-virus antibody levels, viral
shedding, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and T cells.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (median age: 69 years, range: 45-77) with median 5 prior
therapies (range: 2-10) and 2 prior platinum lines (range: 1-5) were enrolled.
There were three dose level cohorts: 3 × 109 (n = 6), 1 × 1010 (n = 5), and
2.5 × 1010 (n = 1) plaque forming units (PFU)/day on two consecutive days.
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included G1/G2 nausea (n = 6), fever
(n = 6), abdominal distention (n = 5), and abdominal pain (n = 4). There were no 
Grade 4 TRAEs, no dose relationship to TRAEs, and no deaths attributed to
Olvi-Vec. The ORR was 9% (1/11). Stable disease (SD) was 64% (7/11), and SD
≥15 weeks was 46% (5/11). Median PFS was 15.7 weeks (95%CI: 5.7-34.5), including 
extended PFS in four patients (23.2, 34.5, 59.4+ and 70.8 weeks). Three patients 
had extended overall survival (deceased 33.6 months, and alive with disease at 54
and 59 months). CTCs diminished in 6/8 (75%) baseline-positive patients. Immune
activation was demonstrated from virus-enhanced tumor infiltration of CD8+
T-cells and activation of tumor-specific T-cells in peripheral blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Oncolytic viral therapy with intraperitoneal Olvi-Vec showed
promising safety, clinical activities, and immune activation in patients with
PRROC, warranting further clinical investigation.
