OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to stratify the early pneumonia trajectory on chest
radiographs and compare patient characteristics in dyspneic patients with
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 139 COVID-19 patients with
dyspnea (87 men, 62.7±16.3 years) and serial chest radiographs from January to
September 2020. Radiographic pneumonia extent was quantified as a percentage
using a previously-developed deep learning algorithm. A group-based trajectory
model was used to categorize the pneumonia trajectory after symptom onset during 
hospitalization. Clinical findings, and outcomes were compared, and Cox
regression was performed for survival analysis.
RESULTS: Radiographic pneumonia trajectories were categorized into four groups.
Group 1 (n = 83, 59.7%) had negligible pneumonia, and group 2 (n = 29, 20.9%) had
mild pneumonia. Group 3 (n = 13, 9.4%) and group 4 (n = 14, 10.1%) showed similar
considerable pneumonia extents at baseline, but group 3 had decreasing pneumonia 
extent at 1-2 weeks, while group 4 had increasing pneumonia extent. Intensive
care unit admission and mortality were significantly more frequent in groups 3
and 4 than in groups 1 and 2 (P < .05). Groups 3 and 4 shared similar clinical
and laboratory findings, but thrombocytopenia (<150×103/μL) was exclusively
observed in group 4 (P = .016). When compared to groups 1 and 2, group 4 (hazard 
ratio, 63.3; 95% confidence interval, 7.9-504.9) had a two-fold higher risk for
mortality than group 3 (hazard ratio, 31.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-280.2), 
and this elevated risk was maintained after adjusting confounders.
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the early radiologic trajectory beyond baseline further
prognosticated at-risk COVID-19 patients, who potentially had
thrombo-inflammatory responses.
