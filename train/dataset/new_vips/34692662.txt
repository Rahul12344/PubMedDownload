Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most dangerous and prevalent agents that
causes acute and chronic liver diseases in humans. Genotyping plays an important 
role in determining clinical outcomes and response to antiviral treatment in
HBV-infected patients. Here, we first devised a CRISPR-based testing platform,
termed "CRISPR-HBV," for ultrasensitive, highly specific, and rapid detection of 
two major HBV genotypes (HBV-B and HBV-C) in clinical application. The CRISPR-HBV
employed multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) for rapid
preamplification and then Cas12b-based detection for decoding the targets.
Finally, the detection result was read out with real-time fluorescence and a
lateral flow biosensor. The sensitivity of CRISPR-HBV was 10 copies per test. The
specificity was one hundred percent, and no cross reactions were observed in
other HBV genotypes and pathogens. The whole detection process, including DNA
template extraction (15 min), preamplification reaction of MCDA (30 min at 65°C),
CRISPR-Cas12b-based detection (5 min at 37°C), and results readout (∼2 min),
could be completed within 1 h. The feasibility of the CRISPR-HBV assay for
genotyping HBV-B and -C as successfully validated with clinical samples. Hence,
the CRISPR-HBV assay has remarkable potential to develop a point-of-care testing 
for identifying and distinguishing HBV genotypes B and C in clinical settings,
especially in resource-scarcity countries.
