The new coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread all around 
the world, eliciting many questions and doubts about the pathogenesis of the
disease and treatment. Mortality has been related to a prothrombotic state. Risk 
factors for the infection and for severe forms of COVID-19 have still to be
defined. According to data collected, women appear to be less prone to severe
forms of the disease and their mortality was lower than for men. The role of
female hormones in the modulation of inflammation may be the reason behind this
gender gap.Considering the prothrombotic state activated by the virus, hormone
therapies have been placed under investigation as possible increasing risk
factors for severe forms. Moreover, new vaccines and their rare thrombotic side
effects have increased the concern about this issue.The goal of this review is to
go over the mechanisms that lead up to thrombosis during COVID-19, trying to
explain the possible reasons why women seem to be naturally protected. The expert
opinions about whether to continue/discontinue hormonal therapies are reviewed.
Moreover, available data about the so-called 'vaccine induced immune thrombotic
thrombocytopaenia' caused by vaccines against COVID-19 are discussed.
