INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection is associated with many different systemic
complications. Among these, cardiovascular system complications are particularly 
important as these are associated with significant mortality. There are many
different subgroups of cardiovascular complications, with Arrhythmias being one
of them. Arrhythmias are especially important as there are a substantial
percentage of patients who have arrhythmia after a COVID-19 infection, and these 
patients are seen with an increased mortality rate. The main interest of this
review is understanding some of the specific post-COVID-19 arrhythmic
complications and their predisposing factors.
AREAS COVERED: This paper will highlight the findings of studies on
cardiovascular system disease after COVID-19 infection, different specific
arrhythmic complications of COVID-19, and changes in electrophysiologic
interventions post-COVID-19 outbreak in different centers around the world. An
extensive literature search was made to find pertinent articles.
EXPERT OPINION: Studies show us that a significant percentage of COVID-19
patients have arrhythmia. Many distinct types of arrhythmias are associated with 
COVID-19 infection, and specific risk factors of these arrhythmias are important 
as this information can be used to detect and prioritize certain at-risk patients
for early treatment, which can mean life or death in some cases.
