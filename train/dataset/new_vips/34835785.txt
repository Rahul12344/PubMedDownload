While many classes of chemotherapeutic agents exist to treat solid tumors, few
can generate a lasting response without substantial off-target toxicity despite
significant scientific advancements and investments. In this review, the paths of
development for nanoparticles, oncolytic viruses, and oncolytic bacteria over the
last 20 years of research towards clinical translation and acceptance as novel
cancer therapeutics are compared. Novel nanoparticle, oncolytic virus, and
oncolytic bacteria therapies all start with a common goal of accomplishing
therapeutic drug activity or delivery to a specific site while avoiding
off-target effects, with overlapping methodology between all three modalities.
Indeed, the degree of overlap is substantial enough that breakthroughs in one
therapeutic could have considerable implications on the progression of the other 
two. Each oncotherapeutic modality has accomplished clinical translation,
successfully overcoming the potential pitfalls promising therapeutics face.
However, once studies enter clinical trials, the data all but disappears, leaving
pre-clinical researchers largely in the dark. Overall, the creativity,
flexibility, and innovation of these modalities for solid tumor treatments are
greatly encouraging, and usher in a new age of pharmaceutical development.
