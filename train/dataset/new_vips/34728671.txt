The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant emotional challenges that individuals
need to select how to regulate. The present study directly examined how during
the pandemic, healthy individuals select between regulatory strategies to cope
with varying COVID-19-related threats, and whether an adaptive flexible
regulatory selection pattern will emerge in this unique threatening global
context. Accordingly, this two-study investigation tested how healthy individuals
during a strict state issued quarantine, behaviorally select to regulate
COVID-19-related threats varying in their intensity. Study 1 created and
validated an ecologically relevant set of low and high intensity sentences
covering major COVID-19 facets that include experiencing physical symptoms,
infection threats, and social and economic consequences. Study 2 examined the
influence of the intensity of these COVID-19-related threats, on behavioral
regulatory selection choices between disengagement via attentional distraction
and engagement via reappraisal. Confirming a flexible regulatory selection
conception, healthy individuals showed strong choice preference for engagement
reappraisal when regulating low intensity COVID-19-related threats, but showed
strong choice preference for disengagement distraction when regulating high
intensity COVID-19-related threats. These findings support the importance of
regulatory selection flexibility for psychological resilience during a major
global crisis.
