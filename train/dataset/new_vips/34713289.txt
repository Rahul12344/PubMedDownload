BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The approach to performing COVID-19 testing in general
practice has been going through an evolution and is variable. The aim of this
study was to determine what underlying factors, if any, impeded onsite COVID-19
testing in general practices for patients during the second wave of the pandemic 
in Victoria.
METHOD: This study was conducted during August 2020 and October 2020. Fourteen
semi-structured interviews with general practitioners, practice nurses and
practice managers were conducted.
RESULTS: Barriers to performing onsite testing for COVID-19 were identified as:
1) individual, 2) practitioner perception of fear, 3) lack of personal protective
equipment, 4) inappropriate clinic design/location, 5) risk of patient avoidance,
6) financial risk, 7) a lack of knowledge and 8) lack of guidelines.
DISCUSSION: This study's findings relate to a unique period in Victoria, which at
the time accounted for 70% of the nation's total cases and 90% of deaths.
Therefore, the barriers identified in this study may help inform policymakers in 
regard to planning for future responses to similar situations.
