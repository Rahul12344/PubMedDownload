While viral replication processes are largely understood, comparably little is
known on cellular mechanisms degrading viral RNA. Some viral RNAs bear a
5'-triphosphate (PPP-) group that impairs degradation by the canonical 5'-3'
degradation pathway. Here we show that the Nudix hydrolase 2 (NUDT2) trims viral 
PPP-RNA into monophosphorylated (P)-RNA, which serves as a substrate for the
5'-3' exonuclease XRN1. NUDT2 removes 5'-phosphates from PPP-RNA in an RNA
sequence- and overhang-independent manner and its ablation in cells increases
growth of PPP-RNA viruses, suggesting an involvement in antiviral immunity. NUDT2
is highly homologous to bacterial RNA pyrophosphatase H (RppH), a protein
involved in the metabolism of bacterial mRNA, which is 5'-tri- or
diphosphorylated. Our results show a conserved function between bacterial RppH
and mammalian NUDT2, indicating that the function may have adapted from a protein
responsible for RNA turnover in bacteria into a protein involved in the immune
defense in mammals.
