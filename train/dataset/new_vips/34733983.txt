Background: While serum hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) play an important
role in the diagnosis and assessment of treatment results of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infections, it remains unclear whether HBsAg levels normalized to hepatic
parenchymal cell volume (HPCV) is a superior indicator of disease state. This
study compared the absolute and HPCV-normalized serum HBsAg levels in hepatitis B
e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis B
(CHB).
Methods: Patients admitted to our institution with CHB were retrospectively
included and categorized into the HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative groups. HPCV 
was calculated based on pathological examination of liver biopsy specimens and
theory of sphere geometry. The difference between HBsAg levels and HBsAg
normalized to HPCV, and also correlation between HBsAg levels and liver
inflammation and fibrosis was analyzed.
Results: Absolute HBsAg levels (P=0.004), but not HPCV-normalized HBsAg levels
(P=0.071) were significantly higher in HBeAg-positive patients compared to
HBeAg-negative patients. In HBeAg-positive CHB patients, absolute HBsAg levels
were positively correlated with liver inflammation grade (R=0.285, P=0.001) and
hepatic fibrosis stage (R=0.351, P<0.001), as were HPCV-normalized HBsAg levels
(R=0.640 and 0.742, both, P<0.001). However, in HBeAg-negative CHB patients, only
HPCV-normalized HBsAg level were correlated with liver inflammation grade and
hepatic fibrosis stage (R=0.640 and 0.785, both, P<0.001).
Conclusions: HPCV-normalized serum HBsAg levels, rather than absolute HBsAg
levels, were positively correlated with liver inflammation grade and hepatic
fibrosis stage in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients. Thus,
HPCV-normalized HBsAg levels may more accurately reflect the pathological
progress of CHB patients compared to absolute HBsAg levels.
