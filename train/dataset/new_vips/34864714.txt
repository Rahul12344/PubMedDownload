BACKGROUND: Analysis of chest X-ray images is one of the primary standards in
diagnosing patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, which is faster than using PCR
Swab method. However, accuracy of using X-ray images needs to be improved.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a new deep learning system of chest X-ray images and
evaluate whether it can quickly and accurately detect pneumonia and COVID-19
patients.
METHODS: The developed deep learning system (UBNet v3) uses three architectural
hierarchies, namely first, to build an architecture containing 7 convolution
layers and 3 ANN layers (UBNet v1) to classify between normal images and
pneumonia images. Second, using 4 layers of convolution and 3 layers of ANN
(UBNet v2) to classify between bacterial and viral pneumonia images. Third, using
UBNet v1 to classify between pneumonia virus images and COVID-19 virus infected
images. An open-source database with 9,250 chest X-ray images including 3,592
COVID-19 images were used in this study to train and test the developed deep
learning models.
RESULTS: CNN architecture with a hierarchical scheme developed in UBNet v3 using 
a simple architecture yielded following performance indices to detect chest X-ray
images of COVID-19 patients namely, 99.6%accuracy, 99.7%precision,
99.7%sensitivity, 99.1%specificity, and F1 score of 99.74%. A desktop GUI-based
monitoring and classification system supported by a simple CNN architecture can
process each chest X-ray image to detect and classify COVID-19 image with an
average time of 1.21 seconds.
CONCLUSION: Using three hierarchical architectures in UBNet v3 improves system
performance in classifying chest X-ray images of pneumonia and COVID-19 patients.
A simple architecture also speeds up image processing time.
