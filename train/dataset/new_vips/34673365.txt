The COVID-19 pandemic continues to highlight both global interconnectedness and
schisms across place, context and peoples. While countries such as Australia have
securitised their borders in response to the global spread of disease, flows of
information and collective affect continue to permeate these boundaries. Drawing 
on interviews with Australian healthcare workers, we examine how their
experiences of the pandemic are shaped by affect and evidence 'traveling' across 
time and space. Our analysis points to the limitations of global health crisis
responses that focus solely on material risk and spatial separation.
Institutional responses must, we suggest, also consider the affective and
discursive dimensions of health-related risk environments.
