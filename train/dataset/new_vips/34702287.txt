BACKGROUND: Targeting RNA is a promising yet underdeveloped modality for the
selective killing of cells infected with HIV-1. The secretory ribonucleases
(RNases) found in vertebrates have cytotoxic ribonucleolytic activity that is
kept in check by a cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein, RI.
METHODS: We engineered amino acid substitutions that enable human RNase 1 to
evade RI upon its cyclization into a zymogen that is activated by the HIV-1
protease. In effect, the zymogen has an HIV-1 protease cleavage site between the 
termini of the wild-type enzyme, thereby positioning a cleavable linker over the 
active site that blocks access to a substrate.
RESULTS: The amino acid substitutions in RNase 1 diminish its affinity for RI by 
106-fold and confer high toxicity for T-cell leukemia cells. Pretreating these
cells with the zymogen leads to a substantial drop in their viability upon HIV-1 
infection, indicating specific toxicity toward infected cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the utility of ribonuclease zymogens as
biologic prodrugs.
