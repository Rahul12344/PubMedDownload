During this COVID-19 pandemic, except steroid, none of the therapeutic measures
have showed any evidence of efficacy. Traditionally jala-neti using lukewarm
salted water remains a yogic way of maintaining upper airway hygiene. Saline
irrigation decreases the concentration of inflammatory mediators (e.g. histamine,
leukotriene etc.) in nasal secretions, reduces the severity and frequency of
sinusitis, reduce need of antibiotic therapy and restores competency of nasal
mucosa. Jala-neti is an integral part of six cleansing techniques of yogic kriyas
practised in India since thousands of years. Jala-neti can clean the upper
airways, prevents colonization of infectious agents, removes foreign bodies,
prevents stasis of mucous and subsequently enhances the drainage of paranasal
sinuses and maintain health. Regular practice of Jala neti improves nasal
symptoms and overall health status of patients with sinusitis. Jala-neti sample
can even be used for COVID-19 diagnosis. Povidone iodine (PVP-I) has been
utilized as a time tested antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum coverage
against wide range of bacteria and viruses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 action of PVP-I was
seen at a concentration as low as 0.45%. PVP-I is generally well tolerated upto
5%, however nasal ciliotoxicity is reported at this concentration, however, this 
toxicity is not reported with lower concentrations(1.25% and 0.5%). So,
theoretically, by using neti-kriya with povidone iodine (0.5-1%) as irrigation
solution can combine and enhance the protection against COVID-19 and this can be 
an important armor in the fight against COVID-19. However, this hypothesis needs 
to be validated in real life clinical trial scenario before implementing.
