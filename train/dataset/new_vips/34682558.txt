With the increased policy emphasis on promoting doula care to advance birth
equity in the United States, there is a vital need to identify sustainable and
equitable approaches for compensation of community doulas, who serve clients
experiencing the greatest barriers to optimal pregnancy-related outcomes. This
case study explores two different approaches for compensating doulas (contractor 
versus hourly employment with benefits) utilized by SisterWeb San Francisco
Community Doula Network in San Francisco, California. We conducted qualitative
interviews with SisterWeb doulas in 2020 and 2021 and organizational leaders in
2020. Overall, leaders and doulas reported that the contractor approach, in which
doulas were paid a flat fee per client, did not adequately compensate doulas, who
regularly attend trainings and provide additional support for their clients
(e.g., referrals to promote housing and food security). Additionally, this
approach did not provide doulas with healthcare benefits, which was especially
concerning during the COVID-19 pandemic. As hourly, benefited employees, doulas
experienced a greater sense of financial security and wellbeing from receiving
consistent pay, compensation for all time worked, and benefits such as health
insurance and sick leave, allowing some to dedicate themselves to birth work. Our
study suggests that efforts to promote community doula care must integrate
structural solutions to provide appropriate compensation and benefits to doulas, 
simultaneously advancing birth equity and equitable labor conditions for
community doulas.
