Coronavirus Disease Spread during Summer Vacation, Israel, 2020.

Somekh I, Sim√µes EAF, Somekh E.

The relative increase in coronavirus disease incidence during summer 2020 in
Israel was most prominent in young children. This finding contrasts with the
lower increase in incidence observed in children than in adults during the school
attendance period. School closure without lockdown conditions might not be
independently effective at reducing spread.
