BACKGROUND: With the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, along with 
the development of new mutations of the virus and an increase in the number of
cases among pediatrics, physicians should be aware and alerted on the atypical
presentations of the disease, especially in less expected individuals.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a 12-year-old obese boy (BMI = 37.5 kg/m2) who
presented with empyema, which was following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient had
no history of fever. Due to the onset of dyspnea, a chest tube was inserted for
him which was later altered to a pleural drainage needle catheter.
CONCLUSION: Our case is the first report of COVID-19 presenting as empyema among 
pediatrics. Pleural empyema should be considered as a rare complication of
COVID-19. Since there is still no guideline in the management of empyema in the
context of COVID-19, delay in diagnosis and intervention may cause morbidity and 
mortality in children.
