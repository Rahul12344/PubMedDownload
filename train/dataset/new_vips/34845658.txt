Stem cell therapy has an unparalleled potential to treat blood cancers,
cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative conditions, among others. However, 
stem cell therapeutics must overcome multiple requirements before reaching
clinical trials, including large animal safety and efficacy studies. In
cardiovascular diseases swine models are the most widely adopted due to its great
translational potential to humans. In this chapter, we will describe several
protocols to induce iPSC dedifferentiation in swine fibroblasts, as well as
conditioning treatments that may help in the reprogramming process.
