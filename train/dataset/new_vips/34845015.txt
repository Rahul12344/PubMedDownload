As coronaviruses (CoVs) replicate in the host cell cytoplasm, they rely on their 
own capping machinery to ensure the efficient translation of their messenger RNAs
(mRNAs), protect them from degradation by cellular 5' exoribonucleases (ExoNs),
and escape innate immune sensing. The CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a
bifunctional replicase subunit harboring an N-terminal 3'-to-5' ExoN domain and a
C-terminal (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain that is presumably
involved in viral mRNA capping. Here, we aimed to integrate structural,
biochemical, and virological data to assess the importance of conserved N7-MTase 
residues for nsp14's enzymatic activities and virus viability. We revisited the
crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp14 to
perform an in silico comparative analysis between betacoronaviruses. We
identified several residues likely involved in the formation of the N7-MTase
catalytic pocket, which presents a fold distinct from the Rossmann fold observed 
in most known MTases. Next, for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome
CoV, site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues was used to assess their
importance for in vitro enzymatic activity. Most of the engineered mutations
abolished N7-MTase activity, while not affecting nsp14-ExoN activity. Upon
reverse engineering of these mutations into different betacoronavirus genomes, we
identified two substitutions (R310A and F426A in SARS-CoV nsp14) abrogating virus
viability and one mutation (H424A) yielding a crippled phenotype across all
viruses tested. Our results identify the N7-MTase as a critical enzyme for
betacoronavirus replication and define key residues of its catalytic pocket that 
can be targeted to design inhibitors with a potential pan-coronaviral activity
spectrum.
