Studying the structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein is important to understand the infection process. 
The S protein is necessary in completing the virus life cycle and is responsible 
for the appearance of new variants and drug and vaccine resistance. Understanding
the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules is essential for
understanding how they function. In this work, we investigated the effects of
mutations on S protein stability and solubility through molecular dynamic (MD)
simulation in a 100 ns (ns) period. We screened four variants in addition to the 
wild type (WT). Results show that changes on MD simulation parameters of S
protein indicate fluctuations and changes in the conformation, especially in the 
area between 300 and 600 amino acids (aa). This provides us an image of how the
virus protein can reshape itself to adapt to any changes that occur in human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or drugs that can target the protein region. Our 
results also show that the Brazil variant has high fluctuations and unstable
folding at some stages compared with other variants.
