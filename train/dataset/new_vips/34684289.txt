Infections with HEV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are associated
with increased rates of preterm birth, miscarriage, and stillbirth. The aim of
the present study was to investigate HEV infections in pregnant women and the
possibility of mother-to-child transmission, and associated outcomes. A total of 
183 pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited and followed until
delivery. Anti-HEV IgG and IgM were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), and HEV nucleic acids were detected in stool and cord blood
samples. HEV genotypes were identified by Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic
analyses were performed. Mother-to-child transmission and associated adverse
outcomes were not observed. Only 2% of patients (n = 4/183) tested positive for
anti-HEV IgM, and 8% (n = 14/183) tested positive for anti-HEV IgG antibodies.
Cord blood (n = 150) analysis showed that there was no IgM detected, while 4% (n 
= 6/150) tested positive for anti-HEV IgG, which was consistent with mothers
testing positive for anti-HEV IgG. Nucleic acid tests for HEV RNA yielded 2% (n =
4/183) from the serum and stool of pregnant women, and none from cord blood. The 
HEV isolates belonged to the genotype HEV-3a, with 99% homology with humans and
96% with pigs. No association was found between the risk of HEV infection and
pregnancy outcomes or HEV transmission from mother to child. HEV-3 infections of 
zoonotic origin in pregnancy might have eventually resolved without
complications.
