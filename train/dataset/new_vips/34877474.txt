Peoples' movements - both local and long-distance - have driven the spread of
COVID-19, within and between communities. At the same time, although most
contagion events involve human travel, not all human travel leads to contagion
events, and deriving information about virus spread from what is known about
human mobility remains a challenge. In the past two years, new datasets and
analyses have shed fresh light on the problem.
