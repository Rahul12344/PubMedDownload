COVID-19 is a global pandemic declared by WHO. This pandemic requires the
execution of planned control strategies, incorporating quarantine,
self-isolation, and tracing of asymptomatic cases. Mathematical modeling is one
of the prominent techniques for predicting and controlling the spread of
COVID-19. The predictions of earlier proposed epidemiological models (e.g. SIR,
SEIR, SIRD, SEIRD, etc.) are not much accurate due to lack of consideration for
transmission of the epidemic during the latent period. Moreover, it is important 
to classify infected individuals to control this pandemic. Therefore, a new
mathematical model is proposed to incorporate infected individuals based on
whether they have symptoms or not. This model forecasts the number of cases more 
accurately, which may help in better planning of control strategies. The model
consists of eight compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I),
asymptomatic (A), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), deaths (D), and insusceptible
(T), accumulatively named as SEIAQRDT. This model is employed to predict the
pandemic results for India and its majorly affected states. The estimated number 
of cases using the SEIAQRDT model is compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models.
The relative error square analysis is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed
model. The simulation is done on real datasets and results show the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. These results may help the government and individuals
to make the planning in this pandemic situation.
