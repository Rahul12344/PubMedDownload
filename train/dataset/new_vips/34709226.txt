A 62-year-old male patient with a history of atypical chest pain ad dyspnea
presented to the emergency room during the COVID-19 pandemic. On admission, the
ECG showed sinus rhythm with diphasic T waves in lead V2. A high resolution
computed tomography revealed signs suggestive of pulmonary infarction and a
subsequent nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. An ECG performed in
the absence of symptoms showed persistence of diphasic T waves in lead V2. In the
suspect of Wellens syndrome, a coronary angiography study was performed and
showed a subocclusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.
