The myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins belong to interferon (IFN)-induced dynamin
GTPase and play a pivotal role in the inhibition of replication of numerous
viruses. In the present study, an Mx homologue (designated as CgMx1) was
identified from oyster Crassostrea gigas. The open reading frame (ORF) of CgMx1
cDNA was of 1689 bp encoding a peptide of 562 amino acid residues. There was an
N-terminal dynamin GTPase domain in the predicted peptide, which consisted of a
tripartite GTP-binding motif (GDXXSGKS, DLPG and T/NKXD). The deduced amino acid 
sequence of CgMx1 shared 30-39% similarity with other Mx family members. And
CgMx1 was clustered with Mx from H. discus, and then assigned into the
invertebrate branch of the phylogenetic tree. The mRNA transcripts of CgMx1 were 
constitutively distributed in all the tested tissues, with the highest level in
haemocytes (1342.45-fold of labial palps, p < 0.05). The mRNA expression of CgMx1
in haemocytes was significantly up-regulated to the highest level at 6 h
(13.14-fold, p < 0.001) after poly (I:C) treatment and at 24 h (66.28-fold,
p < 0.001) after recombinant IFN-like protein (rCgIFNLP) stimulation,
respectively. CgMx1 protein was found to distribute in both the cytoplasm and
nucleus of haemocytes. In the oysters with CgIFNLP and signal transducer and
activator of transcription (CgSTAT) silenced by RNAi, the mRNA expression of
CgMx1 decreased significantly in the haemocytes at 12 h after poly (I:C)
stimulation, which was 0.02-fold and 0.04-fold of that in EGFP-RNAi oysters
(p < 0.001), respectively. Meanwhile, EMSA assay revealed that CgSTAT was able to
transactivate CgMx1 promoter through directly binding to its
interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma interferon activation
site (GAS). The above results indicated that CgMx1 participated in the immune
response of C. gigas through the signal pathway mediated by CgIFNLP and CgSTAT.
