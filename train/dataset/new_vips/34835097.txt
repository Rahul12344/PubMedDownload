BACKGROUND: Dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus are two common
flaviviruses that are spread widely by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Livestock
keeping is vital for cities; however, it can pose the risk of increasing the
mosquito population. Our study explored how livestock keeping in and around a
large city is associated with the presence of mosquitoes and the risk of them
spreading flaviviruses.
METHODS: An entomological study was conducted in 6 districts with 233 households 
with livestock, and 280 households without livestock, in Hanoi city. BG-Sentinel 
traps and CDC light traps were used to collect mosquitoes close to animal farms
and human habitats. Adult mosquitoes were counted, identified to species level,
and grouped into 385 pools, which were screened for flaviviruses using a
pan-flavivirus qPCR protocol and sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 12,861 adult mosquitoes were collected at the 513 households,
with 5 different genera collected, of which the Culex genus was the most
abundant. Our study found that there was a positive association between livestock
keeping and the size of the mosquito population-most predominantly between pig
rearing and Culex species (p < 0.001). One pool of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus,
collected in a peri-urban district, was found to be positive for Japanese
encephalitis virus.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of flavivirus transmission in urban areas of Hanoi city due
to the spread of Culex and Aedes mosquitoes could be facilitated by livestock
keeping.
