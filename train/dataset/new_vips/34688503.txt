BACKGROUNDS: This study investigated the global incidence and mortality of
cervical cancer, its predictors, the temporal trend by country and age.
METHODS: Data from Global Cancer Observatory 2020 for 185 countries was used to
estimate current cervical cancer incidence and mortality and their associations
with predictors by linear regression analysis. Estimated age-standardized rates
(ASR) and average annual percentage changes (AAPC) from cancer registries for up 
to 53 countries through 2018 were used for trend analysis by joinpoint
regression.
RESULTS: Wide variations in cervical cancer were observed globally with the
highest rates of incidence and mortality in East Africa (ASR, 40.1 and 28.6). The
incidence and mortality of cervical cancer were positively associated with human 
papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus infection and negatively associated 
with cervical cancer screening coverage. In the most recent 5 years, reduction of
incidence and mortality was found from 22 (AAPC, -11.2 to -0.5) and 27 countries 
(-21.5 to -0.3). Increase of incidence and mortality was found from 13 (1.7 to
6.5) and 5 (0.3 to 1.8) countries. Comparing to women aged above 50 years,
increasing incidence were additionally found among women under age 50 years from 
9 countries (ranging from 0.2 in Denmark to 3.8 in Sweden).
CONCLUSIONS: While most countries with cancer registry have shown reduction in
cervical cancer incidence and mortality, the increasing incidence among younger
women from some developed countries warrants further implementation of effective 
cancer screening.
