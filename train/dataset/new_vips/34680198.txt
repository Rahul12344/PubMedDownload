Glioblastoma is a malignant brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The standard
treatment has not changed in the past 15 years as clinical trials of new
treatment protocols have failed. A high prevalence of the human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) in glioblastomas was first reported in 2002. The virus was found only in
the tumor and not in the surrounding healthy brain tissue. Many groups have
confirmed the presence of the HCMV in glioblastomas, but others could not. To
resolve this discrepancy, we systematically reviewed 645 articles identified in
different databases. Of these, 81 studies included results from 247 analyses of
9444 clinical samples (7024 tumor samples and 2420 blood samples) by different
techniques, and 81 articles included 191 studies that identified the HCMV in 2529
tumor samples (36% of all tumor samples). HCMV proteins were often detected,
whereas HCMV nucleic acids were not reliably detected by PCR methods. Optimized
immunohistochemical techniques identified the virus in 1391 (84,2%) of 1653
samples. These data suggest that the HCMV is highly prevalent in glioblastomas
and that optimized immunohistochemistry techniques are required to detect it.
