Importance: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures have
disrupted access to psychiatric medications, particularly for women.
Objective: To assess the sex differences in trends in the prescribing of
benzodiazepines, Z-hypnotics and serotonergic (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]),
which are commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and depression.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from Clinformatics
Data Mart, one of the largest commercial health insurance databases in the US.
Enrollees 18 years or older were required to have complete enrollment in a given 
month during our study period, January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2021, to be included
for that month.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Prescription of a benzodiazepine, Z-hypnotic, or SSRI
or SNRI. For each month, the percentage of patients with benzodiazepine,
Z-hypnotic, or SSRI or SNRI prescriptions by sex was calculated.
Results: The records of 17 255 033 adults (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [19.5] years;
51.3% female) were examined in 2018, 17 340 731 adults (mean [SD] age, 52.5
[19.7] years; 51.6% female) in 2019, 16 916 910 adults (mean [SD] age, 53.7
[19.8] years; 51.9% female) in 2020, and 15 135 998 adults (mean [SD] age, 56.2
[19.8] years; 52.5% female) in 2021. Compared with men, women had a higher rate
of prescriptions for all 3 drugs classes and had larger changes in prescription
rates over time. Benzodiazepine prescribing decreased from January 2018 (women:
5.61%; 95% CI, 5.60%-5.63%; men: 3.03%; 95% CI, 3.02%-3.04%) to March 2021
(women: 4.91%; 95% CI, 4.90%-4.93%; men: 2.66%; 95% CI, 2.65%-2.67%), except for 
a slight increase in April 2020 among women. Z-hypnotic prescribing increased
from January 2020 for women (1.39%; 95% CI, 1.38%-1.40%) and February 2020 for
men (0.97%; 95% CI, 0.96%-0.98%) to October 2020 (women: 1.46%; 95% CI,
1.46%-1.47%; men: 1.00%; 95% CI, 0.99%-1.01%). Prescribing of SSRIs and SNRIs
increased from January 2018 (women: 12.77%; 95% CI; 12.75%-12.80%; men: 5.56%;
95% CI, 5.44%-5.58%) to April 2020 for men (6.73%; 95% CI, 6.71%-6.75%) and
October 2020 for women (15.18%; 95% CI, 15.16%-15.21%).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, coinciding with the COVID-19
pandemic onset was an increase in Z-hypnotic as well as SSRI and SNRI
prescriptions in both men and women along with an increase in benzodiazepine
prescriptions in women, findings that suggest a substantial mental health impact 
of COVID-19-associated mitigation measures.
