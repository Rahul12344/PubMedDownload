The association between the use of the injectable contraceptive depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate and HIV-1 susceptibility has been addressed mainly in
respect to the changes occurring in the female genital mucosa and blood. However,
one of the main sites of HIV-1 pathogenesis is lymphoid organs. To investigate
the immunoregulatory effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) at this site,
human tonsillar tissue explants were infected ex vivo with either a CCR5 (BaL) or
CXCR4 (LAI) HIV-1 variant and the release of p24gag and cytokines was measured in
culture supernatant. The response to MPA was compared with that elicited by
treatment with progesterone (P4) and dexamethasone (DEX), which selectively binds
the glucocorticoid receptor, in donor-matched explant cultures. MPA treatment
reduced the replication of both tested HIV-1 strains as well as the production of
the mediators of inflammation IL-1β, IL-17A and CCL5, but not CCL20, in a similar
way to DEX, whereas P4 had no effect on HIV-1 replication. The magnitude of both 
MPA and DEX-mediated responses was proportional to the length of exposure and/or 
administered dose. Blockage of the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors with
mifepristone abolished all observed changes in HIV-1 and cytokine production, and
was associated with increased IL-22 levels in HIV-infected explants. Our data
indicate that elevated doses of MPA may affect the immune responses in lymphoid
tissue in a glucocorticoid-like fashion with an immediate impact on local HIV-1
replication.
