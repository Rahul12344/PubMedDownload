AIMS: COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a public health crisis
worldwide. In this study, we aimed at demonstrating the neutralizing potential of
the IgY produced after immunizing chicken with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein S1 subunit.
METHODS AND RESULTS: E. coli BL21 carrying plasmid pET28a-S1 was induced with
IPTG for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. The recombinant His-tagged S1
was purified and verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and biolayer interferometry
(BLI) assay. Then S1 protein emulsified with Freund's adjuvant was used to
immunize layer chickens. Specific IgY against S1 (S1-IgY) produced from egg yolks
of these chickens exhibited a high titer (1:25,600) and a strong binding affinity
to S1 (KD  = 318 nmol L-1 ). The neutralizing ability of S1-IgY was quantified by
a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus-based neutralization assay with an IC50  value of 
0.99 mg ml-1 . In addition, S1-IgY exhibited a strong ability in blocking the
binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 to hACE2, and it could partially compete with hACE2 for 
the binding sites on S1 by BLI assays.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated here that after immunization of chickens with our
recombinant S1 protein, IgY neutralizing antibodies were generated against the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit; therefore, showing the potential use of IgY 
to block the entry of this virus.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: IgY targeting S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2
could be a promising candidate for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis or
treatment of COVID-19. Administration of IgY-based oral preparation, oral or
nasal spray may have profound implications for blocking SARS-CoV-2.
