BACKGROUND: After receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, most recipients want to know if
they are protected from infection and for how long. Since neutralizing antibodies
are a correlate of protection, we developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that
measures levels of neutralizing antibodies from a drop of blood. The LFA is based
on the principle that neutralizing antibodies block binding of the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
METHODS: The ability of the LFA was assessed to correctly measure neutralization 
of sera, plasma or whole blood from patients with COVID-19 using SARS-CoV-2
microneutralization assays. We also determined if the LFA distinguished patients 
with seasonal respiratory viruses from patients with COVID-19. To demonstrate the
usefulness of the LFA, we tested previously infected and non-infected COVID-19
vaccine recipients at baseline and after first and second vaccine doses.
RESULTS: The LFA compared favorably with SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays
with an area under the ROC curve of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with
seasonal coronaviruses did not show neutralizing activity in the LFA. After a
single mRNA vaccine dose, 87% of previously infected individuals demonstrated
high levels of neutralizing antibodies. However, if individuals were not
previously infected, only 24% demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies
after one vaccine dose. A second dose boosted neutralizing antibody levels just
8% higher in previously infected individuals, but over 63% higher in non-infected
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, semi-quantitative, highly portable and inexpensive
neutralizing antibody test might be useful for monitoring rise and fall in
vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19.
