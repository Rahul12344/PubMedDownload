The impact of the extent of testing infectious individuals on suppression of
COVID-19 is illustrated from the early stages of outbreaks in Germany, the Hubei 
province of China, Italy, Spain and the UK. The predicted percentage of untested 
infected individuals depends on the specific outbreak but we found that they
typically represent 60-80% of all infected individuals during the early stages of
the outbreaks. We propose that reducing the underlying transmission from untested
cases is crucial to suppress the virus. This can be achieved through enhanced
testing in combination with social distancing and other interventions that reduce
transmission such as wearing face masks. Once transmission from silent carriers
is kept under control by these means, the virus could have been fully suppressed 
through fast isolation and contact tracing of tested cases.
