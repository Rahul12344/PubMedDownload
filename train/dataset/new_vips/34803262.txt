Design and development of effective anti-virals in combating CoVid-19 is a great 
challenge worldwide. Known drugs such as chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir and 
remdesivir are used in the management of CoVid - 19. It is known that Ivermectin 
and remdesivir both are effective against filoviruses, paramyxo viruses.
Available data also shows that ivermectin and remedesivir repress the replication
of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we document the potential use of ivermectin and remdesivir
in the management of CoVid -19.
