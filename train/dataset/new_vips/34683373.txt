Recent years have seen the classification and reclassification of many viruses
related to the model enterobacterial phage P2. Here, we report the identification
of a prophage (Smhb1) that infects Salinivibrio kushneri BNH isolated from a
Namib Desert salt pan (playa). Analysis of the genome revealed that it showed the
greatest similarity to P2-like phages that infect Vibrio species and showed no
relation to any of the previously described Salinivibrio-infecting phages.
Despite being distantly related to these Vibrio infecting phages and sharing the 
same modular gene arrangement as seen in most P2-like viruses, the nucleotide
identity to its closest relatives suggest that, for now, Smhb1 is the lone member
of the Peduovirus genus Playavirus. Although host range testing was not extensive
and no secondary host could be identified for Smhb1, genomic evidence suggests
that the phage is capable of infecting other Salinivibrio species, including
Salinivibrio proteolyticus DV isolated from the same playa. Taken together, the
analysis presented here demonstrates how adaptable the P2 phage model can be.
