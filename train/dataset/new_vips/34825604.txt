In Miami-Dade County, women with HIV (WWH) enrolled in Ryan White Program (RWP)
services belong to groups that have historically faced structural barriers to
care. To examine provider perceptions of WWH's barriers to care and elicit
possible solutions, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 20) with medical
case managers and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) healthcare providers from
medical case management sites serving WWH enrolled in the Miami-Dade RWP.
Verbatim transcripts were analyzed thematically by two coders through an
iterative process; disagreements were resolved through consensus. Barriers
included lack of disclosure and stigma, additional psychosocial barriers to care,
structural and logistical barriers, and negative interactions with health care
providers. Participant suggestions to address these barriers included strategies 
that support women and foster individualized services that are responsive to
their lived experiences and needs. Other solutions, such as those related to
transportation, housing, and general funding for the RWP, will require advocacy
and policy change.
