The pestivirus classical swine fever virus (CSFV) represents one of the most
important pathogens of swine. Its virulence is dependent on the RNase activity of
the essential structural glycoprotein Erns that uses an amphipathic helix as a
membrane anchor and forms homodimers via disulfide bonds employing cysteine 171. 
Dimerization is not necessary for CSFV viability but for its virulence. Mutant
Erns proteins lacking cysteine 171 are still able to interact transiently as
shown in crosslink experiments. Deletion analysis did not reveal the presence of 
a primary sequence-defined contact surface essential for dimerization, but
indicated a general importance of an intact ectodomain for efficient
establishment of dimers. Pseudoreverted viruses reisolated in earlier experiments
from pigs with mutations Cys171Ser/Ser209Cys exhibited partially restored
virulence and restoration of the ability to form Erns homodimers. Dimer formation
was also observed for experimentally mutated proteins, in which other amino acids
at different positions of the membrane anchor region of Erns were replaced by
cysteine. However, with one exception of two very closely located residues, the
formation of disulfide-linked dimers was only observed for cysteine residues
located at the same position of the helix.
