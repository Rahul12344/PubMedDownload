The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched and overburdened healthcare services within
the UK. This national crisis has led to the widespread redeployment of healthcare
workers and reorganization of services throughout the NHS in the UK. The flexible
and altruistic nature of healthcare workers has been inspiring, and central in
the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the
'first-hand' experience of a secondary care dentist, highlighting the
redeployment journey to the emergency department (ED) of a major trauma hospital 
in the North-West of England during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
