Background: The ongoing Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed a
plethora of extrapulmonary manifestations including neurological presentations.
To date, nervous system demyelination has been relatively infrequently reported
in this setting. Also, while most data point toward immune activation as a
causative process, few studies propound a direct effect.
Case Description: A 35-year-old man presented with severe new-onset headache,
hemiparesis, and focal seizures culminating in deeply altered sensorium.
Radiological evaluation showed a large expansile demyelinating lesion in the
right cerebral hemisphere. Nasopharyngeal swab COVID reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive. After initial
non-response to steroids, the patient responded well to plasma exchange leading
to complete recovery.
Conclusions: This report highlights a case of active severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting with tumefactive
demyelination and subsequent response to therapy. It is important to recognize
atypical presentations at this juncture as it may be crucial for planning
treatment strategies.
