Infectious diarrhea is caused by a variety of pathogens, including viruses,
bacteria, and parasitic organisms. Though the causative agent of diarrhea has
historically been evaluated via stool cultures, recently, culture-independent
diagnostic tests (CIDT) have been developed and utilized with increasing
frequency. Current practice guidelines recommend their use as adjuncts to stool
cultures for diagnosing acute and chronic diarrhea. The three principal CIDT are 
microscopy, enzyme-based immunoassays (EIAs), and molecular based polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). This review explores the common causes of infectious
diarrhea, the basics of stool culture, the diagnostic utility of these three
culture-independent modalities, and the strengths and weaknesses of all currently
available clinical techniques. It also outlines considerations for specific
populations including returning travelers and those with inflammatory bowel
disease.
