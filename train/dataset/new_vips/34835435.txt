BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a common but fatal complication among patients with
immune suppression. We aimed to investigate the performance of metagenomic
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) compared with standard microbiological
diagnostics in patients with hematologic malignancies.
METHODS: We performed a prospective study from June 2019 to December 2019. Adult 
patients with hematologic malignancies and a clinical diagnosis of sepsis were
enrolled. Conventional diagnostic methods included blood cultures, serum
galactomannan for Aspergillus, cryptococcal antigen and cytomegalovirus (CMV)
viral loads. Blood samples for mNGS were collected within 24 h after hypotension 
developed.
RESULTS: Of 24 patients enrolled, mNGS and conventional diagnostic methods (blood
cultures, serology testing and virus RT-PCR) reached comparable positive results 
in 9 cases. Of ten patients, mNGS was able to identify additional pathogens
compared with conventional methods; most of the pathogens were virus.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that mNGS may serve as adjunctive diagnostic tool
for the identification of pathogens of hematologic patients with clinically
sepsis.
