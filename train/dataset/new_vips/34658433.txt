The need to augment standardized learner outcomes related to performance and
clinical competency led to creating curricular elements that would provide
instruction and assessment from multiple perspectives. The COVID-19 pandemic
brought about needs for re-imagination of standardized simulated clinical
experiences given the need for increased distance-learning and asynchronous
formats. Our goal was to identify activities that would engage pre-clinical
simulation through asynchronous virtual reality (VR) case scenarios. The intent
was to provide additional resources whereby competencies could be more defined
through performance metrics and standardized assessments additive to our
established simulation-based curriculum throughout all curricular phases. Student
reflection and metacognition identified gaps to guide future performance
improvement through the VR activities. Learner outcomes encompassing
history-taking, physical assessment, evidence-based clinical reasoning, and
medical decision-making guided the instructional objectives. The composite data
showed progressive improvements over five scenarios delivered in our second-year 
clinical medicine curriculum.
