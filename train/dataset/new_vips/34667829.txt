Monkeypox (MPX), similar to both smallpox and cowpox, is caused by the monkeypox 
virus (MPXV). It occurs mostly in remote Central and West African communities,
close to tropical rain forests. It is caused by the monkeypox virus in the
Poxviridae family, which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus. We develop and
analyse a deterministic mathematical model for the monkeypox virus. Both local
and global asymptotic stability conditions for disease-free and endemic
equilibria are determined. It is shown that the model undergo backward
bifurcation, where the locally stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with an 
endemic equilibrium. Furthermore, we determine conditions under which the
disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable. Finally,
numerical simulations to demonstrate our findings and brief discussions are
provided. The findings indicate that isolation of infected individuals in the
human population helps to reduce disease transmission.
