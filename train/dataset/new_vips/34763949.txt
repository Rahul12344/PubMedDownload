BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine by Pfizer in
late 2020, efficacy and immunogenicity waning of COVID-19 vaccines was reported, 
and decision making regarding a booster remains a top priority worldwide, a
decision that should be made based on breakthrough infection rate and antibody
titer decline overtime.
METHODS: We conducted a 5-month longitudinal prospective study involving
vaccinated healthcare personnel, who were tested monthly for antibody titer, and 
sampled biweekly and on clinical indication for SARS-COV-2 polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), to determine antibody decline and breakthrough infection.
RESULTS: 100 participants were recruited to the study. Antibody titer reached the
climate after one month of the second dose of the vaccine, and declined rapidly
thereafter: the median antibody levels were 895; 22,266; 9,682; 2,554 and 1,401
AU/ml in the day of the second dose, and in one month interval thereafter,
respectively. In other words, four months after vaccination, the mean antibody
level was 6% of the peak levels. During the study period, 4 breakthrough
infections were diagnosed, 2 of which were asymptomatic, and the remaining two
were mild cases; sharp elevation of antibody titer was seen after infection.
CONCLUSION: Antibody titer drops rapidly one month after the second dose of the
vaccine. All infections within the study period were mild or asymptomatic, after 
which titer elevations were seen.
