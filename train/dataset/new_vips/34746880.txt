Background: To prevent the invasion and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, mRNA-based
vaccines, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, and inactivated vaccines have
been developed. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the use of the
anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in January 2021, the date on which the vaccination
program began in Spain and across Europe. The aim of this study is to monitor the
safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and report any cases of undesirable effects
that have occurred, that are not included in the health profile of mRNA-based
vaccines for commercialisation in humans. Furthermore, a brief review is given of
the mechanism of action of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on the host's immune
system in triggering the reactivation of the herpes varicella-zoster infection.
Methods: Follow-up of patients under the care of the southern health district of 
Seville of the SAS (Andalusian Health Service) during the Spanish state of alarm 
over the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results: Two patients, a 79-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman, are reported
who, after 4 and 16 days respectively of receiving the Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccine
against SARS-CoV-2, presented a state of reactivation of herpes varicella-zoster 
virus (VZV).
Discussion: The immunosenescence of the reported patients, together with the
immunomodulation generated by administering the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, that
depress certain cell subpopulations, could explain the awakening of VZV latency.
