The human endogenous retrovirus-K (HERV-K) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43
(TDP-43) have been associated with the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). Given these findings, we investigated the humoral response
against HERV-K envelope surface (env-su) glycoprotein antigens and TDP-43 in the 
plasma of ALS patients and healthy controls (HCs). The measured levels of Abs
against the different epitopes' fragments were significantly elevated in ALS
patients, both in long-survivor (LS) and newly diagnosed (ND) patients, compared 
to HCs. We observed a positive correlation between HERV-K and TDP-43 antibodies
(Abs) levels, which seemed to strengthen with disease progression, that was not
found in HCs. The TDP-43 and HERV-K epitopes identified in this study are highly 
immunogenic and recognized by the humoral response of ALS patients. Increased
circulating levels of Abs directed against specific HERV-K- and TDP-43-derived
epitopes could serve as possible biomarkers.
