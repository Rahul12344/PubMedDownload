INTRODUCTION: People who inject drugs (PWID) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, have a
high prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). While needle and syringe
programmes (NSP), opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) 
are available in Tanzania, their coverage is sub-optimal. We assess the impact of
existing and scaled up harm reduction (HR) interventions on HIV and HCV
transmission among PWID in Dar es Salaam.
METHODS: An HIV and HCV transmission model among PWID in Tanzania was calibrated 
to data over 2006-2018 on HIV (∼30% and ∼67% prevalence in males and females in
2011) and HCV prevalence (∼16% in 2017), numbers on HR interventions (5254 ever
on OAT in 2018, 766-1479 accessing NSP in 2017) and ART coverage (63.1% in 2015).
We evaluated the impact of existing interventions in 2019 and impact by 2030 of
scaling-up the coverage of OAT (to 50% of PWID), NSP (75%, both combined termed
"full HR") and ART (81% with 90% virally suppressed) from 2019, reducing sexual
HIV transmission by 50%, and/or HCV-treating 10% of PWID infected with HCV
annually.
RESULTS: The model projects HIV and HCV prevalence of 19.0% (95% credibility
interval: 16.4-21.2%) and 41.0% (24.4-49.0%) in 2019, respectively. For HIV,
24.6% (13.6-32.6%) and 70.3% (59.3-77.1%) of incident infections among male and
female PWID are sexually transmitted, respectively. Due to their low coverage
(22.8% for OAT, 16.3% for NSP in 2019), OAT and NSP averted 20.4% (12.9-24.7%) of
HIV infections and 21.7% (17.0-25.2%) of HCV infections in 2019. Existing ART
(68.5% coverage by 2019) averted 48.1% (29.7-64.3%) of HIV infections in 2019.
Scaling up to full HR will reduce HIV and HCV incidence by 62.6% (52.5-74.0%) and
81.4% (56.7-81.4%), respectively, over 2019-2030; scaled up ART alongside full HR
will decrease HIV incidence by 66.8% (55.6-77.5%), increasing to 81.5%
(73.7-87.5%) when sexual risk is also reduced. HCV-treatment alongside full HR
will decrease HCV incidence by 92.4% (80.7-95.8%) by 2030.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination interventions, including sexual risk reduction and HCV
treatment, are needed to eliminate HCV and HIV among PWID in Tanzania.
