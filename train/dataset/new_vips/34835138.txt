Norovirus-associated diseases are the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide. 
Polymerase chain reaction-based methods are the primary diagnostics for clinical 
samples; however, the high mutation rate of norovirus makes viral amplification
and genotyping challenging. Technological advances in mass spectrometry (MS) make
it a promising tool for identifying disease markers. Besides, the superior
sensitivity of MS and proteomic approaches may enable the detection of all
variants. Thus, this study aimed to establish an MS-based system for identifying 
and typing norovirus. We constructed three plasmids containing the major capsid
protein VP1 of the norovirus GII.4 2006b, 2006a, and 2009a strains to produce
virus-like particles for use as standards. Digested peptide signals were
collected using a nano-flow ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry (nano-UPLC/MSE) system, and analyzed by ProteinLynx Global SERVER
and TREE-PUZZLE software. Results revealed that the LC/MSE system had an
excellent coverage rate: the system detected more than 94% of amino acids of 3.61
femtomole norovirus VP1 structural protein. In the likelihood-mapping analysis,
the proportions of unresolved quartets were 2.9% and 4.9% in the VP1 and S
domains, respectively, which is superior to the 15.1% unresolved quartets in
current PCR-based methodology. In summary, the use of LC/MSE may efficiently
monitor genotypes, and sensitively detect structural and functional mutations of 
noroviruses.
