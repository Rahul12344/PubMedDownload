Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune disorder that typically
develops after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. While Campylobacter
jejuni is associated with approximately 30% of cases, organisms such as
Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, influenza virus, and hepatitis A, B, C, and E have
demonstrated clinical associations to GBS. In rare instances, Escherichia coli
infections have been documented as the underlying cause for GBS. Our patient, a
69-year-old female, was admitted with a two-week history of progressively
worsening bilateral lower extremity weakness following diagnosis of an
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase E. coli urinary tract infection. She was
diagnosed with GBS based on acute flaccid paralysis, areflexia, and a nerve
conduction velocity study showing an absent motor response in her lower
extremities bilaterally. The patient subsequently underwent intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment for five days which resulted in significant
improvement in her bilateral lower extremity weakness, a response consistent with
the diagnosis of GBS.
