To curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the use of face masks such as
disposable surgical masks and N95 respirators is being encouraged and even
enforced in some countries. The widespread use of masks has resulted in global
shortages and individuals are reusing them. This calls for proper disinfection of
the masks while retaining their protective capability. In this study, the killing
efficiency of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation, dry heat, and steam sterilization
against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), fungi (Candida albicans), and
nonpathogenic virus (Salmonella virus P22) is investigated. UV-C irradiation for 
10 min in a commercial UV sterilizer effectively disinfects surgical masks. N95
respirators require dry heat at 100 °C for hours while steam treatment works
within 5 min. To address the question on safe reuse of the disinfected masks,
their bacteria filtration efficiency, particle filtration efficiency,
breathability, and fluid resistance are assessed. These performance factors are
unaffected after 5 cycles of steam (10 min per cycle) and 10 cycles of dry heat
at 100 °C (40 min per cycle) for N95 respirators, and 10 cycles of UV-C
irradiation for surgical masks (10 min per side per cycle). These findings
provide insights into formulating the standard procedures for reusing masks
without compromising their protective ability.
