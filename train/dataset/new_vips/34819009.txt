PURPOSE: To investigate the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging characteristics and 
dynamic changes of COVID-19 pneumonia at different stages.
METHODS: Forty-six patients infected with COVID-19 who had chest CT scans were
enrolled, and CT scans were performed 4-6 times with an interval of 2-5 days.
RESULTS: At the early stage (n=25), ground glass opacity was presented in 11
patients (11/25 or 44.0%) and ground glass opacity mixed with consolidation in 13
(13/25 or 52.0%) in the lung CT images. At the progressive stage (n=38), ground
glass opacity was presented in only one patient (1/38 or 2.6%) and ground glass
opacity mixed with consolidation in 33 (33/38 or 86.8%). In the early improvement
stage (n=38), the imaging presentation was ground glass opacity alone in three
patients (3/38 or 7.9%) and ground glass opacity mixed with consolidation in 34
(34/38 or 89.5%). In the late improvement (absorption) stage (n=33), the primary 
imaging presentation was ground glass presentation in eight patients (8/33 or
24.2%) and ground glass opacity mixed with consolidation in 23 (23/33 or 69.7%). 
The lesion reached the peak at 4-16 days after disease onset, and 26 (26/38 or
68.4%) patients reached the disease peak within ten days. Starting from 6 to 20
days after onset, the disease began to be improved, with 30 (30/38 or 78.9%)
patients being improved within 15 days.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia will progress to the peak stage at a mediate time 
of seven days and enter the improvement stage at twelve days. Computed tomography
imaging of the pulmonary lesion has a common pattern from disease onset to
improvement and recovery and provides important information for evaluation of the
disease course and treatment effect.
