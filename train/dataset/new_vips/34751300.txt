BACKGROUND: The flipped classroom is an active method where information in
delivered before class and the time allocated for it is dedicated to achieving
more complex learning objectives. Diverse resources are used in each phase of the
methodology. However, Web 2.0 or "Social Web" tools allow greater personal and
remote interaction.
AIM: To describe the perception about flipped classroom methodology implemented
using web 2.0 tools in 48 medical students from the University Mayor.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The students were invited to view four video-classes
available on Edpuzzl. During the activity, questions about the topic were
inserted to promote understanding, research, and teamwork, then the topic was
discussed using Case-Based Learning through the Quizizz program. A survey
composed of 12 closed items and an open question was applied to analyze the
perceptions of students. Data were analyzed using the SPSS and Atlas-Ti programs.
RESULTS: A high satisfaction rate was observed about the way in which the
content, discussion and communication of the information was presented. The
methodology encouraged the development of generic competences, but it was not
always positively perceived.
CONCLUSIONS: The flipped classroom methodology developed with Edpuzzle was very
well evaluated by students. This teaching method may be particularly useful in
the epidemiological context of COVID-19 and other situations which require
distant learning.
