BACKGROUND: To investigate the intervention effect of dance therapy based on the 
Satir Model on the mental health of adolescents with depression during the
COVID-19 epidemic.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 adolescents with depression were selected
using Symptom Checklist 90 and randomly divided into two groups according to the 
matching of male and female participants; the experiment group had 32 members and
the control group had 30 members. The experiment group received group
psychological intervention and dance therapy based on the Satir Model, whereas
the control group was not given any intervention.
RESULTS: After the intervention, the scores of the experiment group in anxiety
and depression are lower than those prior to intervention (p<0.01) and of the
control group (p<0.01); the scores of the experiment group in life satisfaction, 
psychological resilience and their dimensions are higher than those prior to
intervention (p<0.01) and higher than those of the control group (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of group intervention and dance therapy based on the
Satir Model is a feasible method to effectively alleviate adolescents' anxiety
and depression, promote their life satisfaction and psychological resilience, and
thus improve their mental health.
