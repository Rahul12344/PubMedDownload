One of the ecosystem services of biodiversity is the contribution to pest control
through conservation and stimulation of natural enemies. However, whether plant
diversity around greenhouses is beneficial or a potential risk is heavily
debated. In this review, we argue that most greenhouse pests in temperate
climates are of exotic origin and infest greenhouses mainly through
transportation of plant material. For indigenous pests, we discuss the potential 
ways in which plant diversity around greenhouses can facilitate or prevent pest
migrations into greenhouses. As shown in several studies, an important benefit of
increased plant diversity around greenhouses is the stimulation of indigenous
natural enemies that migrate to greenhouses, where they suppress both indigenous 
and exotic pests. How this influx can be supported by specific plant communities,
plant characteristics, and habitats while minimising risks of increasing
greenhouse pest densities, virus transmission, or hyperparasitism needs further
studies. It also requires a better understanding of the underlying processes that
link biodiversity with pest management. Inside greenhouses, plant biodiversity
can also support biological control. We summarise general methods that growers
can use to enhance pest control with functional biodiversity and suggest that it 
is particularly important to study how biodiversity inside and outside
greenhouses can be linked to enhancement of biological pest control with both
released and naturally occurring species of natural enemies.
