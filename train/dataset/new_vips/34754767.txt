Our group works on the detection and characterization of cassava viruses,
supporting projects that involve large scale pathogen surveillance activities and
resistance screening assays in multiple and remote locations. In order to comply 
with these applications, nucleic acid isolation protocols need to be cost
effective, adjusted for samples that will stand long distance transport and harsh
storage conditions, while maximizing the yield and quality of the nucleic acid
extracts obtained. The method we describe here has been widely used and validated
using different downstream tests (including, but not limited to, Rolling Circle
Amplification and Illumina and Nanopore sequencing), but is currently
unpublished. The protocol begins with milligram amounts of dry leaf samples
stored in silica gel, does not require liquid Nitrogen nor phenol extraction and 
produces an average of 2.11 µg of nucleic acids per mg of dry tissue.•DNA purity 
estimations reveal OD260/280 ratios above 2.0 and OD260/230 ratios above 1.7,
even for samples stored in silica gel for several months.•The high quality of the
extracts is suitable for detection of DNA and RNA viruses, with high
efficiency.•We suggest this method could be used as part of a gold standard kit
for virus detection in cassava.
