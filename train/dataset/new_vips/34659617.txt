Numerous genetic tests for the detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, including those based on the ever-popular
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique, have been reported.
These diagnostic tests give false negatives particularly during the early and
late stages of COVID-19 clearly indicating inadequate test sensitivity. The
entire COVID-19 diagnostic workflow is often overlooked and given very little
attention. Herein, we propose that volumetric modifications to COVID-19 workflows
would significantly improve detection limits. We would therefore encourage
researchers to adopt a holistic approach, in which all the steps of a COVID-19
diagnostic workflow, are carefully scrutinised, particularly those upstream
factors at the viral sampling and pre-analytical stages.
