BACKGROUND: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological state of 
university students has been a cause for concern. In particular, odontology
students have experienced symptoms of anxiety due to the closure of universities 
and the suspension of clinical training.
METHODS: Medline via PubMed was searched for studies on the prevalence of anxiety
in dental undergraduates, published from 1 December 2019 to 1 August 2021.
RESULTS: A total of fifteen studies were included in this review. Our results
show a prevalence of anxiety of 35% reported by dental students, which was
independent of gender, response rate or methodological quality. The only
significant finding was a lower prevalence of anxiety in studies located in
Europe compared to those located in other continents.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest dental students are experiencing significant
levels of anxiety during this COVID-19 pandemic and that there seem to be
differences between students from different regions of the world. Therefore, it
is important to help dental students psychologically as the pandemic situation
continues.
