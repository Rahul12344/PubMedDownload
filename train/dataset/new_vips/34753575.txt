Electrochemical (EC) detection of DNA biomarkers represents an interesting tool
in molecular oncology due to its sensitivity, simplicity, low cost or rapid times
of measurement. However, majority of EC assays, same as most optical-based
techniques, require preceding DNA extraction step to remove other cellular
components, making these assays more laborious and time-consuming. One option to 
circumvent this is to use LAMP (loop-mediated amplification), an isothermal
amplification technique that can amplify DNA directly in crude lysates in a short
time at a constant temperature. Here, we coupled the LAMP reaction with EC
readout to detect DNA from the two most common oncogenic human papillomavirus
(HPV) types that cause cervical cancer in women, i.e. HPV 16 and HPV 18, directly
in crude lysates without a need for DNA extraction step. We show that in crude
lysates, the LAMP reaction was superior to PCR, with very good selectivity on a
panel of cancer cell lines and with high sensitivity, enabling detection of HPV
DNA from as few as 10 cells. As a proof of principle, we applied the assay to
nineteen clinical samples both from uninfected women and from women suffering
from cervical precancerous lesions caused by HPV 16 or HPV 18 genotypes. Clinical
samples were simply boiled for 5 min in homogenization buffer without DNA
extraction step, and amplified with LAMP. We obtained excellent concordance of
our assay with PCR, reaching 100% sensitivity for both genotypes, 81.82%
specificity for HPV 16 and 94.12% specificity for HPV 18. Proposed assay could be
a straightforward, simple, rapid and sensitive alternative for early diagnostics 
of precancerous cervical lesions.
