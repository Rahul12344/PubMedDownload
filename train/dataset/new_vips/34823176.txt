Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a multifunctional transcription factor
that plays an important regulatory role in the interferon (IFN) signaling. IRF4
participates in the process of antivirus, Th cell differentiation and B cell
maturation by regulating the expression of IFN and some lymphokines. In this
study, Cherry Valley duck IRF4 (duIRF4) was cloned and its cDNA was analyzed.
Expression of duIRF4 in a wide variety of tissues and changes in duIRF4
expression due to viral infection also was detected by quantitative real-time
PCR. The results show that duIRF4 contains 1,341 bp of ORF encoding a protein
with 446 amino acids and contains 3 domains: DNA-binding domain (DBD),
IRF-association domain (IAD) and nuclear localization signal (NLS). Quantitative 
real-time PCR analysis showed that duIRF4 was evenly expressed in all tissues
examined, with the highest expression in the spleen, followed by the bursa of
Fabricius, and lower in the skin and brain. In addition, expression of duIRF4 in 
the brain and spleen was significantly upregulated after being infected by duck
plague virus, duck Tembusu virus, and novel duck reovirus. These data suggest
that duIRF4 may be involved in innate immune response.
