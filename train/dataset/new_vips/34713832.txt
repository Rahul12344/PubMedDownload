BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast and it brings 
great pressure to the social economy. Many reports revealed that ginseng can
develop immunity for respiratory disease, but there is no evidence to prove its
effects on COVID-19. This protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis will
clarify the safety and effectiveness of ginseng adjuvant therapy on COVID-19
patients.
METHODS: Different databases (Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese
Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure,
Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan fang Database, ClinicalTrials, World
Health Organization Trials, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry) will be
retrieved to search related articles according to pre-defined inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Clinical recovery time and effective rates will be assessed
as the primary outcomes and any changes of patient's condition will be considered
as the secondary outcomes. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be
conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Endnote X9.3 will be used to
manage data screening. The statistical analysis will be completed by RevMan5.3
and Stata/SE 15.1 software.
RESULTS: This study will assess the effects and safety for ginseng adjuvant
therapy on COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSION: The discussion will be considered to determine whether sufficient
evidence exists to prove the effects of ginseng adjuvant therapy for COVID-19
patients.
