BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) causes major disease worldwide,
impacting 50-100 million people every year, and is spread by the major mosquito
vector Aedes aegypti. Understanding mosquito physiology, including antiviral
mechanisms, and developing new control strategies have become an important step
towards the elimination of DENV disease. In the study reported here, we focused
on autophagy, a pathway suggested as having a positive influence on virus
replication in humans, as a potential antiviral target in the mosquito.
METHODS: To understand the role played by autophagy in Ae. aegypti, we examined
the activation of this pathway in Aag-2 cells, an Ae. aegypti-derived cell line, 
infected with DENV. Rapamycin and 3-methyladenine, two small molecules that have 
been shown to affect the function of the autophagy pathway, were used to activate
or suppress, respectively, the autophagy pathway.
RESULTS: At 1-day post-DENV infection in Aag-2 cells, transcript levels of both
the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-phosphatidylethanolamine
conjugate (LC3-II) and autophagy-related protein 1 (ATG1) increased. Rapamycin
treatment activated the autophagy pathway as early as 1-h post-treatment, and the
virus titer had decreased in the Aag-2 cells at 2 days post-infection; in
contrast, the 3-methyladenine treatment did not significantly affect the DENV
titer. Treatment with these small molecules also impacted the ATG12 transcript
levels in DENV-infected cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies revealed that activation of the autophagy pathway
through rapamycin treatment altered DENV infection in the mosquito cells,
suggesting that this pathway could be a possible antiviral mechanism in the
mosquito system. Here we provide fundamental information needed to proceed with
future experiments and to improve our understanding of the mosquito's immune
response against DENV.
