The rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
around the world has ravaged both global health and economy. This unprecedented
situation has thus garnered attention globally. This further necessitated the
deployment of an effective strategy for rapid and patient-compliant
identification and isolation of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Following this, several companies and institutions across the globe are striving 
hard to develop real-time methods, like biosensors for the detection of various
viral components including antibodies, antigens, ribonucleic acid (RNA), or the
whole virus. This article attempts to review the various, mechanisms, advantages 
and limitations of the common biosensors currently being employed for detection. 
Additionally, it also summarizes recent advancements in various walks of fighting
COVID-19, including its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
