As the search for effective treatment for Covid-19 intensifies, traditional
medicine systems are receiving increasing attention from researchers as well as
the public. While scientific rigour is non-negotiable, there remain fundamental
issues to be addressed when bringing evidence from traditional systems. Here we
examine some of these issues pertaining to Ayurveda and the underlying
philosophical underpinnings, and suggest potential ways to move forward. We find 
an ability to emerge from the cage of "biomedicalism" and its foundational
reductionism essential for appropriate research in Ayurveda. We caution against
pursuing research in Ayurveda by just mimicking modern medicine and highlight the
need for appropriate use of modern science tools and methods to understand
Ayurveda and explore its potential for healthcare. We emphasise the need and
potential for transdisciplinary research in Ayurveda. A balance between
evidence-based medicine and evidence-informed healthcare is required.
