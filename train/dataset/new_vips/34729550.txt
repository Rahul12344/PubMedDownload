High-resolution and rapid imaging of host cell ultrastructure can generate
insights toward viral disease mechanism, for example for a severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we employ
full-rotation soft X-ray tomography (SXT) to examine organelle remodeling induced
by SARS-CoV-2 at the whole-cell level with high spatial resolution and
throughput. Most of the current SXT systems suffer from a restricted field of
view due to use of flat sample supports and artifacts due to missing data. In
this approach using cylindrical sample holders, a full-rotation tomogram of human
lung epithelial cells is performed in less than 10 min. We demonstrate the
potential of SXT imaging by visualizing aggregates of SARS-CoV-2 virions and
virus-induced intracellular alterations. This rapid whole-cell imaging approach
allows us to visualize the spatiotemporal changes of cellular organelles upon
viral infection in a quantitative manner.
