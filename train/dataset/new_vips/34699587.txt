BACKGROUND: Whereas safe, curative treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have
been available since 2015, there are still 58 million infected persons worldwide,
and global elimination may require new paradigms. We sought to understand the
acceptability of long-acting HCV treatment approaches.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, 43-question survey was administered to 1457
individuals with HCV or at risk of HCV at 28 sites in 9 countries to assess
comparative interest in a variety of long-acting strategies in comparison to oral
pills.
RESULTS: Among HCV-positive participants, 37.7% most preferred an injection, 5.6%
an implant, and 6% a gastric residence device, as compared to 50.8% who stated
they would most prefer taking 1 to 3 pills per day. When compared directly to
taking pills, differences were observed in the relative preference for an
injection based on age (p<0.001), location (p<0.001), and prior receipt of HCV
treatment (p=0.005), but not sex. When an implant was compared to pills, greater 
preference was represented by women (p=0.01) and adults of younger ages (p=0.012 
per 5 years). Among participants without HCV, 49.5% felt that injections are
stronger than pills, and 34.7% preferred taking injections to pills. Among those 
at-risk participants who had received injectable medications in the past, 123 out
of 137 (89.8%) expressed willingness to receive one in the future.
CONCLUSIONS: These data point to high acceptability of long-acting treatments,
which for a substantial minority, might even be preferred to pills for the
treatment of HCV infection. Long-acting treatments for HCV infection might
contribute to global efforts to eliminate hepatitis C.
