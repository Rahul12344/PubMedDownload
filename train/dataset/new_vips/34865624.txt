BACKGROUND: Traditional clinical trials are conducted at investigator sites.
Participants must visit healthcare facilities several times for the trial
procedures. Decentralized clinical trials offer an interesting alternative. They 
use telemedicine and other technological solutions (apps, monitoring devices or
web platforms) to decrease the number of visits to study sites, minimise the
impact on daily routine, and decrease geographical barriers for participants. Not
much information is available on the use of decentralization in randomized
clinical trials with vaccines.
METHODS: A hybrid clinical trial may be assisted by parental recording of
symptoms using electronic log diaries in combination with home collected nasal
swabs. During two influenza seasons, children aged 12 to 35 months with a history
of recurrent acute respiratory infections were recruited in 12 primary health
centers of the Valencia Region in Spain. Parents completed a symptom diary
through an ad hoc mobile app that subsequently assessed whether it was an acute
respiratory infection and requested collection of a nasal swab. Feasibility was
measured using the percentage of returned electronic diaries and the validity of 
nasal swabs collected during the influenza season. Respiratory viruses were
detected by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine toddlers were enrolled. Parents completed 10,476 electronic 
diaries out of the 10,804 requested (97%). The mobile app detected 188 potential 
acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and requested a nasal swab. In 173 (92%) ARI 
episodes a swab was taken. 165 (95.4%) of these swabs were collected at home and 
144 (87.3%) of them were considered valid for laboratory testing. Overall, 152
(81%) of the ARIs detected in the study had its corresponding valid sample
collected.
CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid procedures used in this clinical trial with the influenza
vaccine in toddlers were considered adequate, as we diagnosed most of the ARI
cases on time, and had a valid swab in 81% of the cases. Hybrid clinical trials
improve participant adherence to the study procedures and could improve
recruitment and quality of life of the participants and the research team by
decreasing the number of visits to the investigator site. This report emphasises 
that the conduct of hybrid CTs is a valid alternative to traditional CTs with
vaccines. This hybrid CT achieved high adherence of participant to the study
procedures.
