Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 210
million individuals globally and resulted in over 4 million deaths since the
first report in December 2019. The early use of traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten
hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal.
Many TCM formulas and products have a wide application in treating infectious and
non-infectious diseases. Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. (P. cuspidatum), is 
an important Traditional Chinese Medicine with actions of clearing away heat and 
eliminating dampness, draining the gallbladder to relieve jaundice, removing
blood stasis to alleviate pain, resolving phlegm and arrest cough. In the search 
for anti-SARS-CoV-2, P. cuspidatum was recommended as as a therapeutic drug of
COVID-19 pneumonia.In this study, we aimed to identifies P. cuspidatum is the
potential broad-spectrum inhibitor for the treatment of coronaviruses infections.
Methods: In the present study , we infected human malignant embryonal rhabdomyoma
(RD) cells with the OC43 strain of the coronavirus, which represent an
alternative model for SARS-CoV-2 and then employed the cell viability assay kit
for the antiviral activity. We combined computer aided virtual screening to
predicte the binding site and employed Surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR)
to comfirm the interaction between drugs and coronavirus. We employed
fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology to identify drug's inhibition
in the proteolytic activity of 3CLpro and Plpro. Results: Based on our results,
polydatin and resveratrol derived from P. cuspidatum significantly suppressed
HCoV-OC43 replication. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of polydatin
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and Plpro, MERS Mpro and Plpro were 18.66, 125, 14.6
and 25.42 μm, respectively. IC50 values of resveratrol inhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro 
and Plpro, MERS Mpro and Plpro were 29.81 ,60.86, 16.35 and19.04 μM,
respectively. Finally, SPR assay confirmed that polydatin and resveratrol had
high affinity to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV 3Clpro, MERS-CoV 3Clpro and PLpro protein. 
Conclusions: we identified the antiviral activity of flavonoids polydatin and
resveratrol on RD cells. Polydatin and resveratrol were found to be specific and 
selective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro and PLpro, viral cysteine proteases. 
In summary, this study identifies P. cuspidatum as the potential broad-spectrum
inhibitor for the treatment of coronaviruses infections.
