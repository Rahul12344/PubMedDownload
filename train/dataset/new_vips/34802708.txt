INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major
health crisis and the quarantine of most of the planet's population. During
confinement, anxiety symptoms may appear. The pandemic dramatically changes the
lives of individuals by becoming a concrete manifestation of the threat. Constant
exposure to information about the virus can increase anxiety, especially since
the information may be erroneous or contradictory. This article examines the
factors that predict student anxiety in the context of a pandemic.
METHOD: The quantitative study involves a sample of 445 students from the
University of Quebec in Abitibi-Témiscamingue. Anxiety was measured using the
Beck Anxiety Inventory, and several sociodemographic variables were tested.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated the effects of certain variables on anxiety,
especially for women and non-binary people, were more marked than for men. Having
dependent children has proven to be a protective factor.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that this variability is now considered when
proposing intervention measures in a containment context. The limitations and
perspectives of the study are presented and analyzed.
