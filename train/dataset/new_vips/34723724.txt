R U OK?

Jones-Schenk J.

Recently, some high-profile athletes and other celebrities have raised the
visibility and public discussion of issues of mental health. The dialogue about
mental health and the most extreme effect of depression, increased suicide rates,
is needed now more than ever. The level of moral distress that our health care
workers are experiencing in this recent spike of corona-virus disease (COVID-19) 
infection is taking an incredible social, emotional, and professional toll. Some 
describe their experience as post-traumatic stress disorder, and others report
experiencing numbness, fog, despair, and hopelessness. The intervention discussed
here, R U OK?, is gaining traction on social media as a way that everyone can
engage to help to address the effects on individuals. [J Contin Educ Nurs.
