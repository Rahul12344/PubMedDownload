INTRODUCTION: Since the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with TDF plus
3TC plus EFV, this specific regimen has not been studied enough with long-term
lipid and uric acid monitoring.
METHODS: A prospective follow-up cohort study was performed. Sixty-one
treatment-naive male patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were
divided into three groups based on their baseline CD4+ cell count (26, 12, and 23
patients in the < 200, 200 to 350, and > 350 groups, respectively). The lipid and
purine metabolism parameters of the patients over 144 weeks were analyzed.
RESULT: Within 144 weeks, TG, LDL-c, TC and HDL-c gradually increased, especially
TC and HDL-c (P = 0.001, 0.000, respectively). Moreover, the percentages of
hyper-cholesterolemia, hyper LDL cholesterolemia, hyper-triglyceridemia and low
HDL cholesterolemia also gradually increased, especially low HDL cholesterolemia 
significantly increased (P = 0.0007). The lower the baseline CD4+ cell counts
were, the higher the TG levels and the lower the TC, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were.
But there was significant difference of only baseline LDL-c levels between the
three groups (P = 0.0457). No significant difference of the UA level and the
percentages of hyperuricemia was found between the different follow-up time point
groups or between the three CD4+ cell counts groups (all P > 0.05). The risk
factors for dyslipidemia included age, anthropometric parameters and follow-up
weeks, and for hyperuricemia was virus load.
CONCLUSIONS: Gradual increasing dyslipidemia was found in male patients with
human immunodeficiency virus primarily treated with tenofovir plus lamivudine
plus efavirenz for 3 years. There-fore lipid metabolism parameters should be
closely monitored during long-term ART with the TDF plus 3TC plus EFV regimen.
