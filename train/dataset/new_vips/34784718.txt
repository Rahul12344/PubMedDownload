This is the second special issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food
Chemistry (JAFC) that reviews the Agricultural and Food Chemistry Division (AGFD)
technical program from a national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).
The 260th meeting was virtually held on August 17-20, 2020 as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Although it was the first-ever all online meeting in ACS
history, a total of 311 abstracts were submitted to the AGFD technical program
for oral and poster presentations and 34 technical sessions were held in 22
symposia, which covered a broad range of food and agricultural topics. The very
first virtual ACS meeting was successful with the high quality of presentations, 
the number of online audiences, and seamless technology.
