Introduction: Disseminated sporotrichosis is an incapacitating infection caused
by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii. Because this condition may mimic
the presentation of tuberculosis, syphilis and other bacterial infections, the
diagnosis may be missed or delayed.
Case Presentation: We describe a case of disseminated sporotrichosis in a patient
with poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus infection. The patient was
initially treated for bacterial skin infections. The differential diagnosis also 
included tuberculosis and syphilis. Only after appropriate specimens had been
sent for microbiological and histopathological investigations was the diagnosis
of disseminated sporotrichosis made and appropriate treatment started. The
patient showed a good clinical response to itraconazole.
Conclusion: This report highlights the importance of having a high index of
suspicion of endemic mycoses when managing immunocompromised patients. The report
also demonstrates that a delay in the diagnosis of sporotrichosis increases
morbidity and results in unnecessary and inappropriate treatment with associated 
costs and adverse effects.
