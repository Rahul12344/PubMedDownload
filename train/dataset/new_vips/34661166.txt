In December 2019, a newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus was emerged from China and 
propagated worldwide as a pandemic, resulting in about 3-5% mortality.
Mathematical models can provide useful scientific insights about transmission
patterns and targets for drug development. In this study, we propose a
within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering innate and
adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibrium points of the proposed
model and obtain an expression of the basic reproduction number. We then
numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation. The proposed model
is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19 patients. Using the
estimated parameters, we perform global sensitivity analysis with respect to the 
peak of viral load. Finally, we study the efficacy of antiviral drugs and
vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results suggest that
blocking the virus production from infected cells can be an effective target for 
antiviral drug development. Finally, it is found that vaccination is more
effective intervention as compared to the antiviral treatments.
