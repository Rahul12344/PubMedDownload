The present article offers an analysis from a bioethical perspective of the
treatment provided to senior citizens in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To
begin with, the article highlights the paradox that exists when measures are
adopted for the care of elderly people during a pandemic, and in some occasions
the age of the patient is the determining factor for deciding whether to provide 
care or not in cases of scarcity. The question that arises then is: What is the
adequate treatment for senior citizens? Using the Inter-American Convention on
the Protection of the Human Rights of Elderly Persons as a point of reference,
this article assesses the problem of the scarce resource allocation in the Third 
Age during a pandemic. As a conclusion, the pandemic is a great opportunity to
reflect on the respect that we should give to every human being at every stage of
his/her life.
