BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate whether the De Ritis ratio can also be 
used in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as a follow-up parameter, such as NLR,
which is used in the follow-up and treatment of many diseases.
METHODS: Ninety-nine patients admitted to our hospital with suspected COVID-19
were included in the study. Demographic data of the patients, their history
characteristics, presenting symptoms, filiation status, duration of clinical
stay, and length of stay in intensive care unit, intubation, dialysis, and
plasmapheresis needs were examined. The patients were divided into two groups:
PCR positive and PCR negative. The presenting, 5th day, and the clinical
discharge values of AST, ALT, LDH, urea, creatine, eGFR, De Ritis ratio,
procalcitonin, CRP, WBC, NLR, ferritin, lymphocyte, and D-dimer levels of the
patients in both groups were studied.
RESULTS: The DM and CAD presence in the histories of PCR-positive patients was
found to be statistically signifi-cantly higher (p = 0.05, p = 0.03,
respectively). Presenting symptoms of headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal
symptoms, and taste loss were significantly higher in the PCR-positive patients
(p = 0.04, p = 0.02, p = 0.03, p = 0.02, respectively). In the PCR-positive
patients, a statistically significant correlation was found between the
presenting De Ritis ratios and the presenting NLR, 5th day NLR, and NLR at
discharge (p = 0.007, p = 0.02, p = 0.015, respectively). In the PCR-positive
group, the 1st and 5th day De Ritis ratios of females were statistically
significantly higher than males (p = 0.000, p = 0.006, respectively). Albumin,
procalcitonin, length of stay in intensive care unit were significantly higher in
the PCR-positive patients, while the presenting D-dimer, presenting WBC, and
presenting and 5th day lymphocyte values were significantly higher in the
PCR-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the De Ritis ratios can be used in
PCR-positive patients as a parameter, such as NLR, to follow-up and determine the
prognosis of many diseases.
