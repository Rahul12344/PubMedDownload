OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of
observational studies to investigate the association between diabetes,
hypertension, body mass index (BMI) or smoking with the risk of death in patients
with COVID-19 and to estimate the proportion of deaths attributable to these
conditions.
METHODS: Relevant observational studies were identified by searches in the
PubMed, Cochrane library and Embase databases through 14 November 2020.
Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95%
CIs. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane methods and the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework.
RESULTS: A total of 186 studies representing 210 447 deaths among 1 304 587
patients with COVID-19 were included in this analysis. The SRR for death in
patients with COVID-19 was 1.54 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.64, I2=92%, n=145, low
certainty) for diabetes and 1.42 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.54, I2=90%, n=127, low
certainty) for hypertension compared with patients without each of these
comorbidities. Regarding obesity, the SSR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.31 to 1.61, I2=91%, 
n=54, high certainty) for patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 compared with those with
BMI <30 kg/m2 and 1.12 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.17, I2=68%, n=25) per 5 kg/m2 increase
in BMI. There was evidence of a J-shaped non-linear dose-response relationship
between BMI and mortality from COVID-19, with the nadir of the curve at a BMI of 
around 22-24, and a 1.5-2-fold increase in COVID-19 mortality with extreme
obesity (BMI of 40-45). The SRR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.40, I2=74%, n=28, low 
certainty) for ever, 1.29 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.62, I2=84%, n=19) for current and
1.25 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.42, I2=75%, n=14) for former smokers compared with never
smokers. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death was increased by 14%, 11%, 12% and
7% for diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking, respectively. The proportion 
of deaths attributable to diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking was 8%, 7%,
11% and 2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking
were associated with higher COVID-19 mortality, contributing to nearly 30% of
COVID-19 deaths.
