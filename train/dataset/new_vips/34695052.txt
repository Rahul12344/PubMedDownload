ABSTRACT: Up to 80% of patients have symptoms lasting 4-12 weeks or longer post
infection with COVID-19. Persistent symptoms can be diverse and may include
myalgia, insomnia, mobility issues, hair loss, loss of smell/taste, shortness of 
breath, chest pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and depression. More evidence 
will be forthcoming regarding long-term COVID-19 sequelae.
