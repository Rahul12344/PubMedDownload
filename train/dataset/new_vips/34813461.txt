INTRODUCTION: Cranial nerve (CN) VI palsy is a common complaint seen in the
emergency department (ED) and has a wide range of causes. Bilateral CN VI palsies
are uncommon and appear to be associated with more severe complications.
CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old male presented to the ED from an ophthalmology office 
for diplopia, headache, and strabismus. He was found to have bilateral CN VI
palsies and new-onset seizure in the ED. A lumbar puncture revealed cryptococcal 
meningitis. Additional tests revealed a new diagnosis of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and syphilis.
CONCLUSION: Cryptococcal meningitis remains a life-threatening complication of
HIV/AIDS. Coinfections with HIV, particularly syphilis, further complicate a
patient's prognosis as both can lead to devastating neurological sequelae. In
cryptococcal meningitis, elevated intracranial pressure is a complication that
can manifest as seizures, altered mental status, and cranial nerve palsies.
