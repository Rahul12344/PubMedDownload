Introduction: Italy was one of the earliest countries to experience a severe
COVID-19 epidemic and vaccinating the elderly, who constitute 23% of the
population and have experienced the highest mortality rates, is a top priority.
Estimating prevalences and understanding risk factors for COVID-19 vaccine
hesitancy or refusal are important for development of targeted interventions.
Methods: We used data from a specially developed COVID-19 module of PASSI
D'Argento, an ongoing surveillance system of residents 65+ years of age to
measure the prevalence and identify risk factors for hesitancy and refusal to
receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We calculated multinomial regression relative risk 
ratios to examine the association between demographic characteristics, health
status, COVID-19 attitudes and experiences and likely vaccine hesitancy and
refusal. Results: Of the 1876 respondents, 55% reported they would accept
vaccination and 16% would likely refuse; the remaining 29% were categorized as
hesitant. Compared with the acceptance group, we identified several risk factors 
in common between the hesitancy group and the refusal group, including not having
received vaccination against influenza during the previous flu season (hesitancy:
RRR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.4-2.9; refusal: RRR = 12.1; 95%CI 7.6-19.4) and lower risk of
having had a death from COVID-19 among family or friends (hesitancy: RRR = 4.8;
95%CI 2.0-11.4; refusal: RRR = 15.4; 95%CI 3.7-64.5). The hesitancy group was
significantly more likely being worried and they did not know if consequences of 
the disease would be serious for them. Conclusion: Our findings show the
importance of establishing and maintaining active contact between the preventive 
services, primary care providers and the population because trust is difficult to
establish during an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic. Italian public health
is based on a capillary network of general practitioners and having them reach
out to their patients who have not previously received influenza vaccine may be a
useful strategy for targeting efforts to further encourage uptake of COVID-19
vaccination.
