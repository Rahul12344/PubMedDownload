BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic affected universities and institutions and
caused campus shutdowns with a transition to online teaching models. To detect
infections that might spread on campus, we pursued research towards detecting
SARS-CoV-2 in air samples inside student dorms.
METHODS: We sampled air in 2 large dormitories for 3.5 months and a separate
isolation suite containing a student who had tested positive for COVID-19. We
developed novel techniques employing 4 methods to collect air samples: Filter
Cassettes, Button Sampler, BioSampler, and AerosolSense sampler combined with
direct qRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 analysis.
RESULTS: For the 2 large dorms with the normal student population, we detected
SARS-CoV-2 in 11 samples. When compared with student nasal swab qRT-PCR testing, 
we detected SARS-CoV-2 in air samples when a PCR positive COVID-19 student was
living on the same floor of the sampling location with a detection rate of 75%.
For the isolation dorm, we had a 100% SARS-CoV-2 detection rate with AerosolSense
sampler.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest air sampling may be an important SARS-CoV-2
surveillance technique, especially for buildings with congregant living settings 
(dorms, correctional facilities, barracks). Future building designs and public
health policies should consider implementation of Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning surveillance.
