BACKGROUND: Mutually respectful and long-term global partnerships are critical to
increasing hospice and palliative care access as a key component of universal
health coverage. The importance of sustained, transnational palliative care
collaboration has become more urgent since the COVID-19 pandemic.
AIM: To provide an overview of characteristics for successful global palliative
nursing partnerships.
METHOD: The authors highlight the need to adapt approaches to meet the challenges
and demands of COVID-19 in both clinical and academic spaces. Exemplars of
thriving global partnerships are provided, alongside palliative nursing
considerations and strategies to advance and sustain them.
CONCLUSION: The role of nursing to drive and enhance palliative care
partnerships, especially with equitable input from low- and middle-income country
stakeholders, must be leveraged to advance shared goals and reduce serious
health-related suffering around the world.
