The current situation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide is still
very severe. Presently, many breakthroughs have been accomplished in the research
and development of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, especially vaccines;
however, some of the so-called COVID-19-specific drugs highlighted in the early
stage failed to achieve the expected curative effect. There is no antiviral
therapy available, by stimulating protective immunity vaccine is the best choice 
for the future management of infection. Therefore, we aimed to identify the
latest developments in the research and development of these drugs and vaccines
and provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
