SARS-CoV-2 triggered a worldwide pandemic disease, COVID-19, for which an
effective treatment has not yet been settled. Among the most promising targets to
fight this disease is SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which has been extensively
studied in the last few months. There is an urgency for developing effective
computational protocols that can help us tackle these key viral proteins. Hence, 
we have put together a robust and thorough pipeline of in silico protein-ligand
characterization methods to address one of the biggest biological problems
currently plaguing our world. These methodologies were used to characterize the
interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with an α-ketoamide inhibitor and include details 
on how to upload, visualize, and manage the three-dimensional structure of the
complex and acquire high-quality figures for scientific publications using PyMOL 
(Protocol 1); perform homology modeling with MODELLER (Protocol 2); perform
protein-ligand docking calculations using HADDOCK (Protocol 3); run a virtual
screening protocol of a small compound database of SARS-CoV-2 candidate
inhibitors with AutoDock 4 and AutoDock Vina (Protocol 4); and, finally, sample
the conformational space at the atomic level between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the
α-ketoamide inhibitor with Molecular Dynamics simulations using GROMACS (Protocol
5). Guidelines for careful data analysis and interpretation are also provided for
each Protocol.
