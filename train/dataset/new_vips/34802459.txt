BACKGROUND: Redirection of natural killer (NK) cells with chimeric antigen
receptors (CAR) is attractive in developing off-the-shelf CAR therapeutics for
cancer treatment. However, the site-specific integration of a CAR gene into NK
cells remains challenging.
METHODS: In the present study, we genetically modified human induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs) with a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to introduce a
cDNA encoding an anti-EpCAM CAR into the adeno-associated virus integration site 
1, a "safe harbour" for transgene insertion into human genome, and next
differentiated the modified iPSCs into CAR-expressing iNK cells.
RESULTS: We detected the targeted integration in 4 out of 5 selected iPSC clones,
3 of which were biallelically modified. Southern blotting analysis revealed no
random integration events. iNK cells were successfully derived from the modified 
iPSCs with a 47-day protocol, which were morphologically similar to peripheral
blood NK cells, displayed NK phenotype (CD56+CD3-), and expressed NK receptors.
The CAR expression of the iPSC-derived NK cells was confirmed with RT-PCR and
flow cytometry analysis. In vitro cytotoxicity assay further confirmed their
lytic activity against NK cell-resistant, EpCAM-positive cancer cells, but not to
EpCAM-positive normal cells, demonstrating the retained tolerability of the
CAR-iNK cells towards normal cells.
CONCLUSION: Looking ahead, the modified iPSCs generated in the current study hold
a great potential as a practically unlimited source to generate anti-EpCAM CAR
iNK cells.
