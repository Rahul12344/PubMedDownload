BACKGROUND: A new clinical syndrome has been recognized following the COVID-19
vaccine, termed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The following
systematic review focuses on extrapolating thrombotic risk factors, clinical
manifestations, and outcomes of patients diagnosed with TTS following the
COVID-19 vaccine.
METHODS: We utilized the World Health Organization's criteria for a confirmed and
probable case of TTS following COVID-19 vaccination and conducted a systematic
review and posthoc analysis using the PRISMA 2020 statement. Data analysis was
conducted using SPSS V25 for factors associated with mortality, including age,
gender, anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, platelet nadir, D-dimer peak, time to event 
diagnosis, arterial or venous thrombi.
RESULTS: Of the 175 studies identified, a total of 25 studies with 69 patients
were included in this systematic review and post hoc analysis. Platelet nadir
(P < .001), arterial or venous thrombi (χ2 = 41.911, P = .05), and chronic
medical conditions (χ2 = 25.507, P = .041) were statistically associated with
death. The ROC curve analysis yielded D-dimer (AUC = .646) and platelet nadir
(AUC = .604) as excellent models for death prediction.
CONCLUSION: Adenoviral COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to trigger TTS, however,
reports of patients having received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are also present.
Healthcare providers are recommended to maintain a high degree of suspicion among
individuals who have received the COVID-19 vaccine within the last 4 weeks.
