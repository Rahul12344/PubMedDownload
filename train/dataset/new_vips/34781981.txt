BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising strategy to break
COVID-19 transmission. Although hydroxychloroquine was evaluated for treatment
and post-exposure prophylaxis, it is not evaluated for COVID-19 PrEP yet. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PrEP with
hydroxychloroquine against placebo in healthcare workers at high risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection during an epidemic period.
METHODS: We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial
in three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. From 350 adult healthcare workers
screened, we included 269 participants with no active or past SARS-CoV-2
infection (determined by a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and a negative 
serology against SARS-CoV-2). Participants allocated in the intervention arm
(PrEP) received 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily for the first four consecutive
days and subsequently, 400 mg weekly during the study period. Participants in the
control group followed the same treatment schedule with placebo tablets.
RESULTS: 52.8% (142/269) of participants were in the hydroxychloroquine arm and
47.2% (127/269) in the placebo arm. Given the national epidemic incidence decay, 
only one participant in each group was diagnosed with COVID-19. The trial was
stopped due to futility and our study design was deemed underpowered to evaluate 
any benefit regarding PrEP efficacy. Both groups showed a similar proportion of
participants experiencing at least one adverse event (AE) (p=0.548). No serious
AEs were reported. Almost all AEs (96.4%, 106/110) were mild. Only mild
gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly higher in the hydroxychloroquine arm
compared to the placebo arm (27.4% (39/142) vs 15.7% (20/127), p=0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the efficacy of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine for preventing
COVID-19 could not be evaluated, our study showed that PrEP with
hydroxychloroquine at low doses is safe.
