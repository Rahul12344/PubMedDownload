Background: The health-related challenges caused by the virus and the
implications of the policies implemented to fight against it further cause
psychological and socio-economic consequences that could threaten the well-being 
of the people.
Objective: This study has been carried out to identify people's psychosoical
reactions toward COVID-19.
Method: Semi-structured interviews as a qualitative research method were used to 
collect data from 20 people across three countries, and content analysis was
applied to interpret the data.
Results: Overall, the results indicated that COVID-19 has had negative
consequences on psychological well-being of the general population. COVID-19 has 
forced people to maintain social distance and has led to family conflicts in some
families. Moreover, COVID-19 has caused loss of jobs and mental health problems.
Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected people's daily life and a significant influence
on individuals and society. This research demonstrates some of the ramifications 
in terms of psychological well-being of the general population. One of the most
important findings is the importance of social life and meeting people in person,
not just online. The current pandemic is influencing people's psychological
well-being in a variety of ways.
