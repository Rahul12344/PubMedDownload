Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits strong
stability on conventional stainless steel (SS) surface, with infectious virus
detected even after two days, posing a high risk of virus transmission via
surface touching in public areas. In order to mitigate the surface toughing
transmission, the present study develops the first SS with excellent
anti-pathogen properties against SARS-COV-2. The stabilities of SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 
influenza A virus (H1N1), and Escherichia coli (E.coli) on the surfaces of
Cu-contained SS, pure Cu, Ag-contained SS, and pure Ag were investigated. It is
discovered that pure Ag and Ag-contained SS surfaces do not display apparent
inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1. In comparison, both pure Cu and
Cu-contained SS with a high Cu content exhibit significant antiviral properties. 
Significantly, the developed anti-pathogen SS with 20 wt% Cu can distinctly
reduce 99.75% and 99.99% of viable SARS-CoV-2 on its surface within 3 and 6 h,
respectively. In addition, the present anti-pathogen SS also exhibits an
excellent inactivation ability for H1N1 influenza A virus (H1N1), and Escherichia
coli (E.coli). Interestingly, the Cu ion concentration released from the
anti-pathogen SS with 10 wt% and 20 wt% Cu was notably higher than the Ag ion
concentration released from Ag and the Ag-contained SS. Lift buttons made of the 
present anti-pathogen SS are produced using mature powder metallurgy technique,
demonstrating its potential applications in public areas and fighting the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens via surface touching.
