Public health crises are challenging for governments and health systems. Vaccines
are a key solution to viruses, and immunization has always played a critical role
during public health crises in the past century. In the context of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), we explore China's vaccination strategies and
challenges. Accordingly, we identify the causes of the high vaccination rate in
China, including technical and nontechnical factors. Considering the impact of
China's high vaccination rate on the global pandemic, we argue that it has
strengthened China's opportunities and capabilities to participate in global
development, enhanced the equity of vaccines and given the world community more
choices.
