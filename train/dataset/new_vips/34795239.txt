The relationship between age and seroprevalence can be used to estimate the
annual attack rate of an infectious disease. For pathogens with multiple
serologically distinct strains, there is a need to describe composite exposure to
an antigenically variable group of pathogens. In this study, we assay 24,402
general-population serum samples, collected in Vietnam between 2009 to 2015, for 
antibodies to eleven human influenza A strains. We report that a principal
components decomposition of antibody titer data gives the first principal
component as an appropriate surrogate for seroprevalence; this results in annual 
attack rate estimates of 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.1%) for subtype H3 and 16.0%
(95% CI: 14.7% - 17.3%) for subtype H1. The remaining principal components
separate the strains by serological similarity and associate birth cohorts with
their particular influenza histories. Our work shows that dimensionality
reduction can be used on human antibody profiles to construct an
age-seroprevalence relationship for antigenically variable pathogens.
