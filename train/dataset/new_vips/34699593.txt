In April 2020, two Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) and one Swan Goose (Anser
cygnoides) were found dead at three different locations in western Mongolia.
Virus isolation from organs taken from the carcasses and full genome sequencing
revealed that all three birds were positive for highly pathogenic H5N6 avian
influenza virus (HPAIV) belonging to subclade 2.3.4.4h. Confirming similar
reports from central Mongolia and western China, these findings have important
implications for the monitoring, control, and management of HPAIVs in wild bird
and commercial poultry populations in Mongolia.
