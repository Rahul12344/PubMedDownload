The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to lockdowns for much of
the world. In Italy, all health procedures not directly related to COVID-19 were 
reduced or suspended, thus limiting patient access to hospitals. Any delay in
cancer treatment presents the additional risk of tumors progressing from being
curable to incurable. Specifically, melanoma survival rate strictly depends on
tumor thickness, which, in turn, is a function of time. To estimate the impact on
melanoma progression caused by the reduction in dermatologic services during the 
COVID-19 lockdown, a retrospective observational cohort study was conducted. This
study was designed to compare the clinical and histologic characteristics of the 
primary melanomas removed in the first 2 months after the end of the lockdown
(May-July 2020) in 12 Italian centers characterized by different COVID-19 case
frequencies. The control group was represented by the melanomas removed during
the same period in the previous 3 years. Overall, 1,124 melanomas were
considered: 237 as part of the study group and 887 from the control group
(average, 295), with a 20% reduction. Breslow thickness, as well as high-risk
histotypes and melanomas with vertical growth, increased for all melanomas.
Ulcerated and high mitotic index melanomas increased, particularly in northern
Italy. In Italy, the lockdown led to a significant worsening of melanoma
severity, causing a staging jump, with a consequent worsening of outcomes.
