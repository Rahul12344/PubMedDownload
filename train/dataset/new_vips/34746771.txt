The COVID-19 pandemic starting in the first half of 2020 has changed the lives of
everyone across the world. Reduced mobility was essential due to it being the
largest impact possible against the spread of the little understood SARS-CoV-2
virus. To understand the spread, a comprehension of human mobility patterns is
needed. The use of mobility data in modelling is thus essential to capture the
intrinsic spread through the population. It is necessary to determine to what
extent mobility data sources convey the same message of mobility within a region.
This paper compares different mobility data sources by constructing spatial
weight matrices at a variety of spatial resolutions and further compares the
results through hierarchical clustering. We consider four methods for
constructing spatial weight matrices representing mobility between spatial units,
taking into account distance between spatial units as well as spatial covariates.
This provides insight for the user into which data provides what type of
information and in what situations a particular data source is most useful.
