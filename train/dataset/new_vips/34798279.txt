Human papillomavirus infection is among the leading viral infections in the
world, causing severe mortality and morbidity. The virus mainly targets the
female genital tract-cervix, vulva, anus but it is also reported to infect the
lungs and oropharyngeal region of the body. The host immune response plays a
vital role in the persistence of viral infection. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is
mainly secreted by Th17 cells and mediates the immune response that enhances the 
disease severity in HPV infection. IL-17 is reported to promote lesions and
tumour progression by creating a hyperinflammatory condition leading to cancer.
The current minireview summarizes the pathogenic role of IL-17 in HPV infection
and HPV-induced malignancies. Further study on IL-17 associated pathology of HPV 
infection would be useful in developing therapeutic measures.
