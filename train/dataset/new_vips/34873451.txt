Background: SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the heart of COVID-19 patients. It is
unclear how the virus passes from the upper respiratory tract to the myocardium. 
We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 is present in the blood of COVID-19 infected
patients, spreading to other organs such as heart.
Methods: We targeted two viroporins, Orf3a and E, in SARS-CoV-2. Orf3a and E form
non-voltage-gated ion channels. A combined fluorescence potassium ion assay with 
three channel modulators (4-aminopyridine, emodin-Orf3a channel blocker, and
gliclazide-E channel blocker) was developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a/E channel 
activity. In blood samples, we subtracted the fluorescence signals in the absence
and presence of emodin/gliclazide to detect Orf3a and E channel activity.
Results: In lentivirus-spiked samples, we detected significant channel activity
of Orf3a/E based on increase in fluorescence induced by 4-aminopyridine, and this
increase in fluorescence was inhibited by emodin and gliclazide. In 18
antigen/PCR-positive samples, our test results found 15 are positive,
demonstrating 83.3% concordance. In 24 antigen/PCR-negative samples, our test
results found 21 are negative, showing 87.5% concordance.
Conclusions: We developed a cell-free test that can detect Orf3a/E channel
activity of SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples from COVID-19-infected individuals,
confirming a hypothesis that the virus spreads to the heart via blood
circulation.
