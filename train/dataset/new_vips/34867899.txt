Neurotropic viruses have neural-invasive and neurovirulent properties to damage
the central nervous system (CNS), leading to humans' fatal symptoms. Neurotropic 
viruses comprise a lot of viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), herpes simplex
virus (HSV), rabies virus (RABV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Effective therapy is needed to prevent infection
by these viruses in vivo and in vitro. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
usually prevents macromolecules from entering the CNS, which challenges the usage
of the traditional probes, antiviral drugs, or neutralizing antibodies in the
CNS. Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly reported in the
targeted therapy of neurotropic viruses due to their sensitivity and targeting
characteristics. Therefore, the present review outlines efficient functionalized 
NPs to further understand the recent trends, challenges, and prospects of these
materials.
