OBJECTIVES: Non-healthcare keyworkers face distinct occupational vulnerabilities 
that have received little consideration within broader debates about 'essential' 
work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this
study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives
and mental health and well-being of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK.
DESIGN: In-depth, qualitative interviews, analysed using a reflexive thematic
analysis.
SETTING: Telephone or video call interviews, conducted in the UK between
September 2020 and January 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: 23 participants aged 26-61 (mean age=47.2) years employed in a
range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail,
education, postal services, the police and fire services, waste collection,
finance and religious services.
RESULTS: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19
pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent
transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often
experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient
personal protective equipment and a lack of workplace mitigation practices.
Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased
workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of
disempowerment.
CONCLUSIONS: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare
keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic 
and in preparation for other infections (eg, seasonal influenza) in the future.
This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to 
the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique
risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.
