The hematologic system is one of the vulnerable parts of the human body in
coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. Lymphopenia and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) are among the most frequent consequences of
COVID-19. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is one of the common causes of
thrombocytopenia in adults. It is defined by thrombocytopenia when platelet
counts <105/μl in the absence of anemia and leukopenia. Traditionally,
infections, typically viral, have been known as the main culprits of low platelet
counts before the involvement of ITP. According to the literature, C virus (HCV),
HIV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are considered
secondary causative agents for the development of ITP. In this study, we reported
a case that was afflicted with concurrent severe thrombocytopenia diagnosed as
ITP and COVID-19 infection.
