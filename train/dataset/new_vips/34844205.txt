Case Report: Splenic Infarction in Infectious Mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr
Virus Infection.

Nishioka H, Hayashi K, Shimizu H.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis
(IM) and IM is a clinical syndrome typically characterized by fever, pharyngitis,
and cervical lymph node enlargement. We describe the case of a 19-year-old man
with IM complicated by splenic infarction. The patient visited our hospital
because of upper abdominal pain without a fever and sore throat. Abdominal
computed tomography revealed a low-density area in the spleen, which indicated
splenic infarction. The next day, he developed a fever. After diminishing
abdominal pain and fever, he developed pharyngitis accompanied by fever. Acute
EBV infection was confirmed by serological tests. The patient was successfully
managed with no specific therapy. Splenic infarction is a rare complication of IM
and this case showed that splenic infarction can precede a fever and pharyngitis.
