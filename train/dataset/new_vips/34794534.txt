We present a European Union/European Economic Area-wide overview of the changes
in consumption of antibacterials for systemic use (ATC J01) in the community
between 2019 and 2020 as reported to the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial
Consumption Network. Overall antibiotic consumption decreased by 18.3% between
2019 and 2020, the largest annual decrease in the network's two-decade history.
We observed a strong association between the level of community antibiotic
consumption in 2019 and the size of the decrease between 2019 and 2020.
