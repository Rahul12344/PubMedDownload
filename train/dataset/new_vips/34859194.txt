Background This study determined whether the naturally attenuated, thermotolerant
Newcastle disease vaccine virus I-2 could acquire virulence after five in vivo
passages through SPF chickens. Methods Study design was to international
requirements including European Pharmacopoeia, Ph. Eur., v9.0 04/2013:0450, 2013.
I-2 Working Seed (WS) was compared with five-times-passaged I-2 WS (5XP WS) in
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), F o cleavage site sequencing and Safety
tests. Results The first passage series used a 50% brain: 50% tracheal tissue
challenge homogenate and was unsuccessful as I-2 was not detected after the
fourth passage. A second passage series used 10% brain: 90% tracheal tissue
homogenates. I-2 was isolated from tracheal tissue in each passage. However
harvested titres were below the minimum challenge level (10 7 EID 50) specified
for the ICPI and Safety tests, possibly reflecting I-2's inherently low
pathogenicity (interestingly caecal tonsils yielded significant titres). Given
this the WS and 5XP WS comparisons proceeded. ICPI values were 0.104 and 0.073
for the WS group and the 5XP WS group respectively confirming that I-2, whether
passaged or not, expressed low pathogenicity. F 0 amino-acid sequences for both
WS and 5XP WS were identified as 112R-K-Q-G-R-↓-L-I-G 119 and so compatible with 
those of avirulent ND viruses. In safety, no abnormal clinical signs were
observed in both groups except for two chicks in the 5XP WS group, where one bird
was withdrawn due to a vent prolapse, and another bird died with inconclusive
necropsy results. Conclusions: These data, the issue of low passage titres with
little or no virus isolation from brain tissues and the genomic copy approach
suggest a need to amend Ph. Eur. v9.0 04/2013:0450, 2013 for naturally
attenuated, low pathogenicity vaccine viruses such as I-2. From an international 
regulatory perspective, the study provides further definitive data demonstrating 
that Newcastle disease vaccine virus I-2 is safe for use.
