The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased workload for nurses and
organisational and structural changes, which have been necessary to meet the
needs of inpatients in isolation.AIM: To describe the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on levels of adherence to the completion of nursing records that
document the risk of developing pressure ulcers, falling, and social
vulnerability among hospitalised patients in isolation.
METHODS: Observational pre-post comparison study. Comparison between nursing
records (the Braden, Downton, and Gijón scales) belonging to 1205 inpatients took
place in two phases. Phase 1: 568 patients admitted in February 2020, prior to
the COVID-19 pandemic, vs. phase 2: 637 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in
March-April 2020, during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This
research adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational
studies.
RESULTS: The degree of completion of the Braden, Downton, and Gijón scales
decreased significantly in phase 2 vs. phase 1 (p < 0.001). The mean Downton and 
Gijón scale scores for patients admitted in phase 1 were higher compared to those
of patients admitted in phase 2 (p < 0.001). The mean Braden scale score in phase
2 was higher than in phase 1 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in the completion 
of nursing records in the clinical records of patients in isolation. The levels
of risk of developing PUs, falling, and social vulnerability of patients admitted
to hospital were lower during the first wave of the pandemic.
