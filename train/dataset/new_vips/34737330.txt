Although the serum lipidome is markedly affected by COVID-19, two unresolved
issues remain: how the severity of the disease affects the level and the
composition of serum lipids and whether serum lipidome analysis may identify
specific lipids impairment linked to the patients' outcome. Sera from 49 COVID-19
patients were analyzed by untargeted lipidomics. Patients were clustered
according to: inflammation (C-reactive protein), hypoxia (Horowitz Index),
coagulation state (D-dimer), kidney function (creatinine) and age. COVID-19
patients exhibited remarkable and distinctive dyslipidemia for each prognostic
factor associated with reduced defense against oxidative stress. When patients
were clustered by outcome (7 days), a peculiar lipidome signature was detected
with an overall increase of 29 lipid species, including-among others-four
ceramide and three sulfatide species, univocally related to this analysis.
Considering the lipids that were affected by all the prognostic factors, we found
one sphingomyelin related to inflammation and viral infection of the respiratory 
tract and two sphingomyelins, that are independently related to patients'
age, and they appear as candidate biomarkers to monitor disease progression and
severity. Although preliminary and needing validation, this report pioneers the
translation of lipidome signatures to link the effects of five critical clinical 
prognostic factors with the patients' outcomes.
