Doctor-patient relationship (DPR) is the cornerstone of clinical medicine,
mobilizing powerful human resources. This article analyzes the impact of COVID-19
pandemia on DPR. Due to fear of contagion, the use of telephone or digital
consultation was preferred, in which only the results of laboratory and imaging
tests can be reviewed, and the patient receives a diagnostic conclusion. Patients
are afraid of face-to-face consultations, and healthcare centers developed
measures to reduce patient influx. Thus, a new relationship ensued, generating
suspicion, mistrust and fear. The empathy and affection that the doctor must
project and deliver to the patient was reduced. Depending on the duration of the 
pandemia, doctors and patients will eventually get used to this type of
relationship and a paradigm shift will occur, in which Hippocratic medicine gives
way to digital medicine.
