Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), a circovirus, is the etiologic agent of
psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), a progressive and often fatal disease
in Psittaciformes. Even though neotropical psittacine species are more resistant 
to clinical infection than Old World species, BFDV is recognized as a threat to
immunologically naïve wild psittacine flocks and its epidemiologic control is
paramount for conservation efforts in Neotropical species. Samples were collected
from multiple psittacine species, including Ara species, Amazona species, and the
white-crowned parrot (Pionus senilis) from the only rescue center in Guatemala
with formal psittacine rehabilitation and reintroduction programs. A total of 117
birds, with 101 adults and 16 juveniles of unknown sex, were tested for BFDV by
means of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The BFDV prevalence
found in this study was 0%, (95% confidence interval, 0%-6.0%). Seven
2-8-year-old scarlet macaws (Ara macao cyanoptera) with positive results from
previous surveys by conventional PCR yielded negative results in this study,
suggesting complete infection resolution.
