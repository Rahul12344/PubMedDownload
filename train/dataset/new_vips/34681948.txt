Chronic diseases and viral infections have threatened human life over the ages
and constitute the main reason for increasing death globally. The rising burden
of these diseases extends to negatively affecting the economy and trading
globally, as well as daily life, which requires inexpensive, novel, and safe
therapeutics. Therefore, scientists have paid close attention to probiotics as
safe remedies to combat these morbidities owing to their health benefits and
biotherapeutic effects. Probiotics have been broadly adopted as functional foods,
nutraceuticals, and food supplements to improve human health and prevent some
morbidity. Intriguingly, recent research indicates that probiotics are a
promising solution for treating and prophylactic against certain dangerous
diseases. Probiotics could also be associated with their essential role in
animating the immune system to fight COVID-19 infection. This comprehensive
review concentrates on the newest literature on probiotics and their metabolism
in treating life-threatening diseases, including immune disorders, pathogens,
inflammatory and allergic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease,
gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and COVID-19 infection. The recent information in 
this report will particularly furnish a platform for emerging novel
probiotics-based therapeutics as cheap and safe, encouraging researchers and
stakeholders to develop innovative treatments based on probiotics to prevent and 
treat chronic and viral diseases.
