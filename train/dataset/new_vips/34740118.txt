Glycogen storage disease type IXa (GSD IXa) is a rare genetic disorder
characterized by phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency, which leads to excessive 
glycogen accumulation in the liver. Urinary cells (UCs) were isolated from a GSD 
IXa patient and reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using
Sendai virus. The established iPSC line, KRIBBi003-A, exhibited pluripotency
marker expression and a normal karyotype. The differentiation capacity of the
cell line was confirmed by the differentiation of the three germ layers in vitro.
The established iPSC line is a potential useful resource for disease modeling of 
GSD IXa.
