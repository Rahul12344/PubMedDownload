Live oral vaccines have been explored for their protective efficacy against
respiratory viruses, particularly for adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7. The potential
of a live oral vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), however, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the
immunogenicity of live SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the gastrointestinal tract in
rhesus macaques and its protective efficacy against intranasal and intratracheal 
SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Post-pyloric administration of SARS-CoV-2 by
esophagogastroduodenoscopy resulted in limited virus replication in the
gastrointestinal tract and minimal to no induction of mucosal antibody titers in 
rectal swabs, nasal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Low levels of serum
neutralizing antibodies were induced and correlated with modestly diminished
viral loads in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage following intranasal and
intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, our data show that post-pyloric
inoculation of live SARS-CoV-2 is weakly immunogenic and confers partial
protection against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.
Importance SARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat, despite the rapid deployment but
limited coverage of multiple vaccines. Alternative vaccine strategies that have
favorable manufacturing timelines, greater ease of distribution and improved
coverage may offer significant public health benefits, especially in
resource-limited settings. Live oral vaccines have the potential to address some 
of these limitations; however no studies have yet been conducted to assess the
immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live oral vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Here we report that oral administration of live SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates 
may offer prophylactic benefits, but that formulation and route of administration
will require further optimization.
