The identification of risk factors is key not only to uncover the pathogenesis of
autoimmune disease but also to predict progression to autoimmune disease.
Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS)/ drug reaction with eosinophilia
and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is likely the best prototypic example for analyzing
the sequential events. We conducted a retrospective study of 55 patients with
DiHS/DRESS followed for the possibility of later development of autoimmune
disease ∼18 years after resolution. Nine patients progressed to autoimmune
sequelae regardless of treatment. The generation of autoantibodies preceded by 8 
years in 8 of the 9 patients. The combination of increases in lymphocyte counts, 
severe liver damage, a rebound increase in globulin, persistent reactivations of 
Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus-6, and low interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4
at the acute/subacute phases, were significant risk factors for the future
development of autoimmune disease. Based on these factors, we established a
scoring system that can identify high-risk patients. When stratified these
patients into three risk categories (low/intermediate/high), occurrence of
autoimmune disease was exclusively detected in the high group. Our data represent
the new scoring system to identify patients at high-risk of developing autoimmune
disease, although a larger study is required to validate the scoring system.
