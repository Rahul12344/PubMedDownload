Objective: To evaluate the extent of coronavirus infection in cancer patients
along with their demographics, laboratory findings and outcomes in a tertiary
care setting.
METHODS: The study was conducted in Muscat, Oman, from March 24 to October 23,
2020. The data was collected from the cancer registry of the Directorate-General 
of Non-Communicable Diseases, Ministry of Health, Oman. Data of inpatient
coronavirus cases were retrieved from the electronic medical records system of
the Royal Hospital, Muscat, all tertiary hospitals linked electronically to the
registry and the coronavirus registry of Oman. The data of cancer patients
infected with coronavirus was analysed and compared with non-cancer
coronavirus-infected patients. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS 2019 v26.
RESULTS: Of the 16,260 cancer patients, 77(0.47%) were infected with COVID-19
compared to 111,837(2.17%) in the national population. Mortality among cancer
patients with COVID-19 was high 27(35.1%) compared to 1,147(1.03%) in the
national population. Cancer patients with COVID-19 also had diabetes 15(20%),
hypertension 20(26%), renal complications 15(20%) and cardiac issues 9(12%). Of
the total, 32(41.6%) cancer patients with COVID-19 had received active cancer
treatment within the preceding 4 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: The data on coronavirus infection outcome is emerging at a rapid
pace focussing on the impact of underlying diseases, and the capacity of
healthcare systems. Oncologists should customise cancer management, while cancer 
patients must practise social distancing, and seek prompt evaluation of
suspicious symptoms.
