Background: Policy changes are often necessary to contain the detrimental impact 
of epidemics such as those brought about by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In
the earlier phases of the emergence of COVID-19, China was the first to impose
strict restrictions on movement (lockdown) on January 23rd, 2020. A strategy
whose effectiveness in curtailing COVID-19 was yet to be determined. We,
therefore, sought to study the impact of the lockdown in reducing the incidence
of COVID-19.
Methods: Daily cases of COVID-19 that occurred in China which were registered
between January 12th and March 30th, 2020, were extracted from the Johns Hopkins 
CSSE team COVID-19 ArcGIS® dashboards. Daily cases reported were used as data
points in the series. Two interrupted series models were run: one with an
interruption point of 23 January 2020 (model 1) and the other with a 14-day
deferred interruption point of 6th February (model 2). For both models, the
magnitude of change (before and after) and linear trend analyses were measured,
and β-coefficients reported with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the precision.
Results: Seventy-eight data points were used in the analysis. There was an 11%
versus a 163% increase in daily cases in models 1 and 2, respectively, in the
preintervention periods (p ≤ 0.001). Comparing the period immediately following
the intervention points to the counterfactual, there was a daily increase of
2,746% (p < 0.001) versus a decline of 207% (p = 0.802) in model 2. However, in
both scenarios, there was a statistically significant drop in the daily cases
predicted for this data and beyond when comparing the preintervention periods and
postintervention periods (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: There was a significant decrease the COVID-19 daily cases reported in
China following the institution of a lockdown, and therefore, lockdown may be
used to curtail the burden of COVID-19.
