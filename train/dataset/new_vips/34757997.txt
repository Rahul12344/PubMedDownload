PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients admitted to ICUs are a heterogeneous group,
displaying multiple anaemia risk factors and comorbidities. Clinicians should
therefore take all possible measures to identify modifiable risks. Patient Blood 
Management (PBM) is an approach promoting the timely application of
evidence-based interventions designed to maintain patients own blood mass.
RECENT FINDINGS: Within ICU-patients, anaemia is highly prevalent. Generally,
anaemia is associated with impaired outcome and need of blood transfusion.
Currently, with ICUs working at full capacity and the global blood reserves
exhausted, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reinforces the need for PBM implementation.
For instance, implementation of a comprehensive coagulation management and
measures to avoid iatrogenic blood loss may prevent bleeding-associated
complications and adherence to blood transfusion guidelines may reduce adverse
events associated with transfusion.
SUMMARY: Critically ill patients display various morbidities often requiring
individualized treatment. PBM offers patient-centred measures to improve outcome 
any time during hospital stay.
