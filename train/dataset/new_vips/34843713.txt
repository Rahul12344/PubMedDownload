COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to human health; it has completely
disrupted global stability, making vaccine development an important goal to
achieve. Monoclonal antibodies play an important role in subunit vaccines
strategies. In this work, nine murine MAbs against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein were obtained by hybridoma technology. Characterization of purified
antibodies demonstrated that five of them have affinities in the order of
108 L/mol. Six MAbs showed specific recognition of different recombinant RBD-S
antigens in solution. Studies of the additivity index of anti-RBD antibodies, by 
using a novel procedure to determine the additivity cut point, showed recognition
of at least five different epitopes. The MAbs CBSSRBD-S.11 and CBSSRBD-S.8
revealed significant neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2 in an ACE2-RBD
binding inhibition assay (IC50 = 85.5pM and IC50 = 122.7pM, respectively) and in 
a virus neutralizing test with intact SARS-CoV-2 (VN50 = 0.552 nM and
VN50 = 4.854 nM, respectively) when D614G strain was used to infect Vero cells.
Also CBSSRBD-S.11 neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 strains Alpha and Beta:
VN50 = 0.707 nM and VN50 = 0.132 nM, respectively. The high affinity CBSSRBD-S.8 
and CBSSRBD-S.7 recognized different epitopes, so they are suitable for the
development of a sandwich ELISA to quantitate RBD-S recombinant antigens in
biomanufacturing processes, as well as in pharmacokinetic studies in clinical and
preclinical trials.
