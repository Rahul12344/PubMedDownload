Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent in the majority of anal, head
and neck, oral, oropharyngeal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and cervical cancers.
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Of all
diagnosed human malignant neoplasms, approximately 4.5% are attributable to HPV, 
including cervical, anal cancers, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oropharyngeal
cancers. Over 182 HPV types have been identified and sequenced to date however,
only certain types of HPV are more frequent in malignant lesions and considered
to be a major risk factor in the development of some cancers. Because most HPV
infections are transient, and an individual's immunocompetent may clear the
infection, HPV infection has received little attention from clinicians, the
general public, or policy makers. This lack of attention may underpin a deadly
and increasing problem because each newly acquired infection has the potential to
persist and become an incurable, lifelong affliction. In addition, no successful 
treatment of HPV infection currently exists despite the great strides toward
understanding the mechanisms underlying HPV pathogenesis. Moreover, ample
research has proven that the use of prophylactic vaccines, such as Gardasil and
Cervarix, have led to documented progress in decreasing the burden of HPV
infection, however not all countries introduced a government-funded National HPV 
Vaccination Program to protect young men and women. This chapter summarizes the
HPV infection, detection and prevention. We also shed light on non-cervical
HPV-related cancers, which is rapidly increasing in more developed countries
toward cervical cancer.
