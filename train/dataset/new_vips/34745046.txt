We describe the most common internal and external sources and types of
contamination encountered in viral metagenomic studies and discuss their negative
impact on sequencing results, particularly for low-biomass samples and clinical
applications. We also propose some basic recommendations for reducing the
background noise in viral shotgun metagenomic (SM) studies, which would limit the
bias introduced by various classes of contaminants. Regardless of the specific
viral SM protocol, contamination cannot be totally avoided; in particular, the
issue of reagent contamination should always be addressed with high priority.
There is an urgent need for the development and validation of standards for viral
metagenomic studies especially if viral SM protocols will be more widely applied 
in diagnostics.
