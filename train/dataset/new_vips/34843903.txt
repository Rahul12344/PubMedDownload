HBV integration and function has gradually been expanding. However, the exact
mode of HBV integration remains unclear. In our research, the high-throughput
long-read sequencing was combined with bioinformatics to study the complete mode 
of HBV integration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The results
demonstrated that: 1) The HBV insertion sequences of HBV integration events
accounted for 49.5% of the total HBV sequences. 2) Short insertion segments with 
the length of 0-1 kbp accounted for 50% and the long insertion segments (>3 kbp) 
accounted for 25% of HBV insertion events. 3)There were different HBV insertion
length in the breakpoints formed within different regions. 4) The occurrence of
HBV integration events was accompanied by more frequent structural variations.
5)Furthermore, multiple HBV integration patterns were confirmed based on complete
HBV insertion sequences. Our research not only clarified a variety of perfect HBV
integration models but also determined multiple specific features of HBV
integration.
