Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic respiratory and vascular disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is a growing number of sensory deficits associated with
COVID-19 and molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are incompletely
understood.
Methods: We report a series of ten COVID-19 patients with audiovestibular
symptoms such as hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction and tinnitus. To
investigate the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and audiovestibular
dysfunction, we examine human inner ear tissue, human inner ear in vitro cellular
models, and mouse inner ear tissue.
Results: We demonstrate that adult human inner ear tissue co-expresses the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the
transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN cofactors required for virus 
entry. Furthermore, hair cells and Schwann cells in explanted human vestibular
tissue can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. We 
establish three human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived in vitro
models of the inner ear for infection: two-dimensional otic prosensory cells
(OPCs) and Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), and three-dimensional inner ear
organoids. Both OPCs and SCPs express ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN, with lower ACE2
and FURIN expression in SCPs. OPCs are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection; lower 
infection rates exist in isogenic SCPs. The inner ear organoids show that hair
cells express ACE2 and are targets for SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions: Our results provide mechanistic explanations of audiovestibular
dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and introduce hiPSC-derived systems for studying
infectious human otologic disease.
