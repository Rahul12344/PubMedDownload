A 39-year-old male was admitted in the emergency room with chest pain. He had
been given the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 3 days before. The
patient denied taking any other medication beyond the usual. He didn't feel sick 
in the previous days/weeks. Laboratory studies revealed elevated serum levels of 
troponin and C-reactive protein. An autoantibody screen and a serologic panel to 
detect common viruses were negative. A cardiac MRI showed myocardial
edema/inflammation and confirmed the diagnosis of perimyocarditis which was
considered to be a consequence of COVID-19 vaccination. Physicians should be
aware of the possibility of cardiovascular complications after COVID-19
vaccination.
