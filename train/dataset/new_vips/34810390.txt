Context: The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused 
by the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and was declared a pandemic disease by the
World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The nasopharyngeal and the
oropharyngeal swabs are being taken during the screening procedure. However, the 
virus is also present in the oral bio-fluid and hence it could be a potential
tool for screening COVID-19 cases.
Aim: The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of whole saliva as a
diagnostic specimen in COVID-19.
Settings and Design: This cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted on
out-patients visiting the COVID-19 hospital.
Methods and Material: The whole saliva and the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal
samples from 309 COVID-19 suspected patients were collected and subjected to
RT-PCR analysis.
Statistical Analysis Used: The paired t test was used to compare the measured
variables (CT values) between the saliva and the swab samples. The positive
predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), the sensitivity, and the
specificity of the tests were calculated for the saliva sample.
Results: The saliva and swab results revealed a similar result (ties) in 86.73%
of the samples. The sensitivity and the specificity between the swab and saliva
samples were 40% and 96.85%, respectively. The positive predictive value of the
saliva sample was 73.3%.
Conclusions: The sensitivity of whole saliva when compared to the swab samples is
low. Large sample studies are needed to validate the role of saliva as a
diagnostic tool in COVID-19.
