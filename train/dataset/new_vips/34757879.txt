COVID-19 and Youth Sports: What Are the Risks of Getting Back on the Field Too
Quickly?

Wang C, Vander Voort W, Haus BM, Carter CW.

The widespread shutdown in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, although varied across state and county levels, has undoubtedly
impacted everyone to some degree. Within the pediatric population, the closure of
schools and organized youth athletic programs has resulted in a unique situation 
that has made athletes physically deconditioned and at risk for injury. As sports
and competition gradually restart, there are considerable risks to the skeletally
immature athlete. The anatomic and physiologic changes that occur to bone and
cartilage during growth make the young athlete particularly susceptible to both
acute and overuse injuries. In the context of the pandemic, deconditioning,
obesity, lack of variety, and the resultant mental health burden pose unique
challenges in ensuring that young athletes safely return to the field. This
review aims to identify risk factors for sport-related injuries and to outline
strategies for minimizing these injuries as pediatric patients return-to-play
after COVID-19. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(11):e465-e469.].
