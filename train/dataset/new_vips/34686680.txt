The use of an adjuvant in vaccination is thought to be effective for enhancing
immune responses to various pathogens. We genetically constructed a live
attenuated simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) to express the adjuvant
molecule Ag85B (SHIV-Ag85B). SHIV-Ag85B could not be detected 4 weeks after
injection in cynomolgus macaques, and strong SHIV-specific T cell responses were 
induced in these macaques. When the macaques in which SHIV-Ag85B had become
undetectable were challenged with pathogenic SHIV89.6P at 37 weeks after
SHIV-Ag85B had become undetectable, SHIV89.6P was not detected after the
challenge. Eradication of SHIV89.6P was confirmed by adoptive transfer
experiments and CD8-depletion studies. The SHIV-Ag85B-inoculated macaques showed 
enhancement of Gag-specific monofunctional and polyfunctional CD8+ T cells in the
acute phase of the pathogenic SHIV challenge. The results suggest that SHIV-Ag85B
elicited strong sterile immune responses against pathogenic SHIV and that it may 
lead to the development of a vaccine for AIDS virus infection.
