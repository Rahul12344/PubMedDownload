Neurosurgery as one of the most technologically demanding medical fields rapidly 
adapts the newest developments from multiple scientific disciplines for treating 
brain tumors. Despite half a century of clinical trials, survival for brain
primary tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain cancer, 
or rare ones including primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), is
dismal. Cancer therapy and research have currently shifted toward targeted
approaches, and personalized therapies. The orchestration of novel and effective 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) drug delivery approaches, targeting of cancer cells and
regulating tumor microenvironment including the immune system are the key themes 
of this review. As the global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 virus continues,
neurosurgery and neuro-oncology must wrestle with the issues related to
treatment-related immune dysfunction. The selection of chemotherapeutic
treatments, even rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) that occur among
immunocompromised people, and number of vaccinations they have to get are
emerging as a new chapter for modern Nano neurosurgery.
