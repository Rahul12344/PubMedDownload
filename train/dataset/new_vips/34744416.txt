Background: Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant
changes that impacted because of it, people around the world have been left
dealing with its consequences-fear of becoming ill and dying, fear of losing
loved ones, uncertainty about the future, and imposed social isolation-several
elements which could lead to psychological consequences. Moreover, as suggested
by recent evidence, the virus acts as a factor in causing psychological symptoms,
including depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Case presentation: Here, we report a case of a patient with new-onset OCD after
his recovery from the coronavirus disease, which presented in the form of
recurrent and persistent intrusive thoughts and doubts which responded to
medication.
Conclusions: This case shows the potential of COVID-19-associated inflammatory
triggers to precipitate or induce obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although this
case cannot support causation, it does stress the bidirectional effects that
physical and mental illness share.
