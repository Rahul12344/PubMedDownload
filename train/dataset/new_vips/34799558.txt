INTRODUCTION: We present the unique case of a nosocomial COVID infection acquired
after urgent surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy, as well as the
sequelae that followed in the postoperative period.
CASE PRESENTATION: An initially COVID-negative patient underwent urgent surgical 
intervention for cervical myelopathy with significant neurological deterioration.
She underwent an uncomplicated staged anterior cervical discectomy and fusion
with corpectomy, as well as a subsequent posterior cervical instrumented fusion
within the same hospitalization. The patient would refuse to adhere to standard
COVID precautions during her admission and demonstrated rapid decompensation
following her particularly uneventful surgeries, ultimately leading to her
expiration. A laboratory test confirmed that she had contracted COVID at the time
of the patient's death.
DISCUSSION: This report highlights the repercussions of COVID-19 infection during
the perioperative period and its implications on surgical outcomes. The stresses 
of surgery and the body's immunosuppressive responses during this time place
patients at particular risk for the contraction of this virus. The standard
precautions should be followed and vaccination should be considered for surgical 
candidates prior to their operations, as they become more readily accessible.
