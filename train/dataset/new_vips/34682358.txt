COVID-19 and its variants have been changing the world. The spread of variants
brings severe effects to the global economy and to human's lives and health, as
well as to society. Lockdown is proven to be effective in stopping the spread. It
also provides a chance to study natural environmental changes with humanity's
limited interference. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of lockdown on five 
major airborne pollutants, i.e., NO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10, in the three
different functional regions of Chongming, Xuhui and Jinshan of Shanghai. Changes
in the same pollutants from the three regions over the same/different periods
were all studied and compared. Overall, the COVID-19 lockdown has changed
pollutant concentrations in the long and short terms. Concentrations of four
pollutants decreased, except for that of earth surface O3, which increased. SO2
had significant correlations with all other pollutants. PM2.5 and PM10 are more
externally input than locally produced. NO2, SO2 and PM levels sharply reduced in
Jinshan and Xuhui due to the limited usage of fossil fuel. Lockdown improved the 
air quality. People now have a chance to rethink the value of life and the
harmony between economic progress and environmental protection. This is helpful
to establish sustainable societies.
