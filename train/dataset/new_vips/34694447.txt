The widespread existence of bacteriophage has been of great interest to the
biological research community and ongoing investigations continue to explore
their diversity and role. They have also attracted attention and in-depth
research in connection to fermented food processing, in particular from the dairy
and wine industries. Bacteriophage, mostly oenophage, may in fact be a 'double
edged sword' for winemakers: whilst they have been implicated as a causal agent
of difficulties with malolactic fermentation (although not proven), they are also
beginning to be considered as alternatives to using sulphur dioxide to prevent
wine spoilage. Investigation and characterisation of oenophage of Oenococcus
oeni, the main species used in winemaking, are still limited compared to
lactococcal bacteriophage of Lactococcus lactis and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum
(formally Lactobacillus plantarum), the drivers of most fermented dairy products.
Interestingly, these strains are also being used or considered for use in
winemaking. In this review, the genetic diversity and life cycle of phage,
together with the debate on the consequent impact of phage predation in wine, and
potential control strategies are discussed. KEY POINTS: • Bacteriophage detected 
in wine are diverse. • Many lysogenic bacteriophage are found in wine bacteria. •
Phage impact on winemaking can depend on the stage of the winemaking process. •
Bacteriophage as potential antimicrobial agents against spoilage organisms.
