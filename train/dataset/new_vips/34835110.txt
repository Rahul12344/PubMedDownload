ss(+)RNA viruses represent the dominant group of plant viruses. They owe their
evolutionary superiority to the large number of mutations that occur during
replication, courtesy of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Natural selection rewards 
successful viral subtypes, whose effective tuning of the ecosystem regulates the 
interactions between its participants. Thus, ss(+)RNA viruses act as shuttles for
the functionally important genes of the participants in symbiotic relationships
within the ecosystem, of which the most common ecological triad is
"plant-virus-insect". Due to their short life cycle and large number of
offspring, RNA viruses act as skillful tuners of the ecosystem, which benefits
both viruses and the system as a whole. A fundamental understanding of this
aspect of the role played by viruses in the ecosystem makes it possible to apply 
this knowledge to the creation of DNA insecticides. In fact, since the genes that
viruses are involved in transferring are functionally important for both insects 
and plants, silencing these genes (for example, in insects) can be used to
regulate the pest population. RNA viruses are increasingly treated not as
micropathogens but as necessary regulators of ecosystem balance.
