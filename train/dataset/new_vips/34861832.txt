BACKGROUND: Human astrovirus (HAstV) and sapovirus (SaV) are common pathogens
that can cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE). However, very few studies have
reported the molecular epidemiology and clinical information on HAstV and SaV in 
China. This study aims to determine the molecular epidemiology and clinical
features of HAstV and SaV in patients with AGE in Guangzhou, China.
METHODS: For this study, 656 patients with AGE were enrolled. Their stool samples
were screened for 15 enteropathogens using Luminex xTAG® Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel. HAstV and SaV were detected through an in-house multiplex reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by phylogenetic analysis. We
described and compared clinical features of AGE in patients with HAstV and SaV.
RESULTS: Of the 656 stool samples, 63.72% (418/656) were found to be positive,
with 550 enteropathogens (296 bacteria and 254 viruses). HAstV and SaV were
detected in 20 (3.0%) and 12 (1.8%) samples, respectively. Four genotypes
(genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 8) of HAstV and three genotypes (GI.1, GI.2 and GIV) of
SaV were identified. Coinfection was observed in ten HAstV-positive and two
SaV-positive samples. HAstV was more likely to occur in winter, while SaV in
early spring. The median age of the patients with single HAstV infection was
higher than that of the patients with other viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, and
enteric adenovirus; P = 0.0476) and unknown etiology (P = 0.006). Coinfection
with HAstV or SaV were not associated with disease severity (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: HAstV and SaV are the common causes of AGE in Guangzhou, China.
