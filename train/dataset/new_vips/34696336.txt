BACKGROUND: In healthy pregnancies, components of the Renin-Angiotensin system
(RAS) are present in the placental villi and contribute to invasion, migration,
and angiogenesis. At the same time, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)
production is induced after binding of ANG-II to its receptor (AT-1R) in response
to hypoxia. As RAS plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, we
hypothesized that angiogenic marker (sFlt-1) and RAS components (ANG-II and
ACE-2) may be related to adverse outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19;
Methods: Prospective cohort study. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia.
Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, intubation, sepsis, and death. Spearman's 
Rho test was used to analyze the correlation between sFlt-1 and ANG-II levels.
The sFlt-1/ANG-II ratio was determined and the association with each adverse
outcome was explored by logistic regression analysis and the prediction was
assessed using receiver-operating-curve (ROC); Results: Among 80 pregnant women
with COVID-19, the sFlt-1/ANG-II ratio was associated with an increased
probability of severe pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.31; p = 0.003), ICU admission
(OR: 1.05; p = 0.007); intubation (OR: 1.09; p = 0.008); sepsis (OR: 1.04; p =
0.008); and death (OR: 1.04; p = 0.018); Conclusion: sFlt-1/ANG-II ratio is a
good predictor of adverse events such as pneumonia, ICU admission, intubation,
sepsis, and death in pregnant women with COVID-19.
