Purpose: In locally advanced p16+ oropharynx cancer (OPSCC), 1) to investigate
kinetics of circulating tumor human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA (ctDNA) and
association with tumor progression after chemoradiation (CRT), and 2) to compare 
the predictive value of ctDNA to imaging biomarkers of MRI and FDG-PET. Methods: 
Serial blood samples were collected from patients with AJCC8 stage III OPSCC
(n=34) enrolled on a randomized trial: pre-treatment, during CRT at weeks 2, 4
and 7, and post-treatment. All patients also had dynamic-contrast-enhanced and
diffusion weighted (DW) MRI, as well as FDG PET scans pre-CRT and week 2 during
CRT. ctDNA values were analyzed for prediction of freedom from progression (FFP),
and correlations with aggressive tumor subvolumes with low blood volume (TVLBV)
and low apparent diffusion coefficient (TVLADC), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV)
using Cox proportional hazards model and spearman's rank correlation. Results:
Low pretreatment ctDNA and an early increase in ctDNA at week 2 compared to
baseline were significantly associated with superior FFP (p<0.02 and p < 0.05,
respectively). At week 4 or 7, neither ctDNA counts nor clearance were
significantly predictive of progression (p=0.8). Pretreatment ctDNA values were
significantly correlated with nodal TVLBV, TVLADC and MTV pre-CRT (p<0.03), while
the ctDNA values at week 2 were correlated with these imaging metrics in primary 
tumor. Multivariate analysis showed that ctDNA and the imaging metrics performed 
comparably to predict FFP. Conclusions: Early ctDNA kinetics during definitive
chemoradiation may predict therapy response in stage III OPSCC.
