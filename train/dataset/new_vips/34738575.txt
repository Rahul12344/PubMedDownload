BACKGROUND AND AIM: During the first wave of the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, we faced a massive clinical and
organizational challenge having to manage critically ill patients outside the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This was due to the significant imbalance between ICU 
bed availability and the number of patients presenting Acute Hypoxemic
Respiratory Failure caused by SARS-CoV-2-related interstitial pneumonia. We
therefore needed to perform Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) in non-intensive wards
to assist these patients and relieve pressure on the ICUs and subsequently
implemented a new organizational and clinical model. This study was aimed at
evaluating its effectiveness and feasibility.
METHODS: We recorded the anamnestic, clinical and biochemical data of patients
undergoing non-invasive mechanical ventilation while hospitalized in
non-intensive CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) wards. Data were registered on
admission, during anesthesiologist counseling, and when NIV was started and
suspended. We retrospectively registered the available results from routine
arterial blood gas and laboratory analyses for each time point.
RESULTS: We retrospectively enrolled 231 patients. Based on our criteria, we
identified 46 patients as NIV responders, representing 19.9% ​​of the general
study population and 29.3% of the patients that spent their entire hospital stay 
in non-ICU wards. Overall mortality was 56.2%, with no significant differences
between patients in non-intensive wards (57.3%) and those later admitted to the
ICU (54%) Conclusions: NIV is safe and manageable in an emergency situation and
could become part of an integrated clinical and organizational model.
