BACKGROUND: Although comprehensive public health measures such as mass quarantine
have been taken internationally, this has generally been ineffective, leading to 
a high infection and mortality rate. Despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic 
has been downgraded to epidemic status in many countries, the real number of
infections is unknown, particularly in low-income countries. However, precision
shielding is used in COVID-19 management, and requires estimates of mass
infection in key groups. As a result, rapid tests for the virus could be a useful
screening tool for asymptomatic virus shedders who are about to come into contact
with sensitive groups. In Africa and other low- and middle-income countries there
is high rate of COVID-19 under-diagnosis, due to the high cost of molecular
assays. Exploring alternate assays to the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 diagnosis is highly warranted.
AIM: This review explored the feasibility of using alternate molecular, rapid
antigen, and serological diagnostic assays to accurately and precisely diagnose
COVID-19 in African populations, and to mitigate severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR diagnostic challenges in Africa.
METHOD: We reviewed publications from internet sources and searched for
appropriate documents available in English. This included Medline, Google
Scholar, and Ajol. We included primary literature and some review articles that
presented knowledge on the current trends on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in Africa and
globally.
RESULTS: Based on our analysis, we highlight the utility of four different
alternatives to RT-PCR. These include two isothermal nucleic acid amplification
assays (loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinase polymerase 
amplification (RPA)), rapid antigen testing, and antibody testing for tackling
difficulties posed by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in Africa.
CONCLUSION: The economic burden associated COVID-19 mass testing by RT-PCR will
be difficult for low-income nations to meet. We provide evidence for the utility 
and deployment of these alternate testing methods in Africa and other LMICs.
