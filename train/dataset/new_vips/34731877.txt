ABSTRACT: A growing number of adolescents are being diagnosed with acute
myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations. This case describes an
adolescent who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and
tachycardia following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination. Point-of-care
ultrasound was performed prior to the return of laboratory studies and revealed
depressed left ventricular systolic function. Point-of-care ultrasound may be a
tool used to rapidly diagnose or risk stratify patients with potential
post-COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis.
