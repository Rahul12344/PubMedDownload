OBJECTIVE: Diet-induced obesity is often associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), which instigates severe metabolic disorders including cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma and type 2 diabetes. Recently, we have shown that
hepatic depletion of CREB regulated transcription co-activator (CRTC) 2 protects 
mice from the progression of diet-induced fatty liver phenotype, although the
exact mechanism by which CRTC2 modulates this process is elusive to date. Here we
investigated the role of hepatic CRTC2 in the instigation of NAFLD in mammals.
METHODS: Crtc2 liver-specific knockout (Crtc2 LKO) mice and Crtc2 flox/flox
(Crtc2 f/f) mice were fed high fat diet (HFD) for 7-8 weeks. Body weight, liver
weight, hepatic lipid contents, and plasma triacylglycerol (TG) levels were
determined. Western blot analysis was performed to determine Sirtuin (SIRT) 1,
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 2, and mammalian target of rapamycin complex
(mTORC) 1 activity in the liver. Effects of Crtc2 depletion on lipogenesis was
determined by measurement of lipogenic gene expression (western blot analysis and
qRT-PCR) in the liver as well as oil red o staining in hepatocytes. Effects of
miR-34a on mTORC1 activity and hepatic lipid accumulation was assessed by
AAV-miR-34a virus in mice and Ad-miR-34a virus and Ad-anti-miR-34a virus in
hepatocytes. Autophagic flux was assessed by western blot analysis after
leupeptin injection in mice and bafilomycin treatment in hepatocytes. Lipophagy
was assessed by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy.
Expression of CRTC2 and p-S6K1 in livers of human NAFLD patients were assessed by
immunohisotochemistry.
RESULTS: We found that expression of CRTC2 in the liver is highly induced upon
HFD-feeding in mice. Hepatic depletion of Crtc2 ameliorated HFD-induced fatty
liver disease phenotypes, with a pronounced inhibition of mTORC1 pathway in the
liver. Mechanistically, we found that expression of TSC2, a potent mTORC1
inhibitor, was enhanced in Crtc2 LKO mice, due to the decreased expression of
miR-34a and the subsequent increase in SIRT1-mediated deacetylation processes.
Indeed, we showed that ectopic expression of miR-34a led to the induction of
mTORC1 pathway, leading to the hepatic lipid accumulation in part by limiting
lipophagy and enhanced lipogenesis. Finally, we found a strong association of
CRTC2, miR-34a and mTORC1 activity in the NAFLD patients in humans, demonstrating
a conservation of signaling pathways among species.
CONCLUSIONS: These data collectively suggest that diet-induced activation of
CRTC2 instigates the progression of NAFLD by activating miR-34a-mediated lipid
accumulation in the liver via the simultaneous induction of lipogenesis and
inhibition of lipid catabolism. Therapeutic approach to specifically inhibit
CRTC2 activity in the liver could be beneficial in combating NAFLD in the future.
