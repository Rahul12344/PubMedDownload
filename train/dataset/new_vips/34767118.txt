PURPOSE: To study the effect of interferon-α2 auto-antibodies (IFN-α2 Abs) on
clinical and virological outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the
risk of IFN-α2 Abs transfer during convalescent plasma treatment.
METHODS: Sera from healthy controls, cases of COVID-19, and other respiratory
illness were tested for IFN-α2 Abs by ELISA and a pseudo virus-based
neutralization assay. The effects of disease severity, sex, and age on the risk
of having neutralizing IFN-α2 Abs were determined. Longitudinal analyses were
performed to determine association between IFN-α2 Abs and survival and viral load
and whether serum IFN-α2 Abs appeared after convalescent plasma transfusion.
RESULTS: IFN-α2 neutralizing sera were found only in COVID-19 patients, with
proportions increasing with disease severity and age. In the acute stage of
COVID-19, all sera from patients with ELISA-detected IFN-α2 Abs (13/164, 7.9%)
neutralized levels of IFN-α2 exceeding physiological concentrations found in
human plasma and this was associated with delayed viral clearance. Convalescent
plasma donors that were anti-IFN-α2 ELISA positive (3/118, 2.5%) did not
neutralize the same levels of IFN-α2. Neutralizing serum IFN-α2 Abs were
associated with delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN-α2 Abs were detected by ELISA and neutralization assay in
COVID-19 patients, but not in ICU patients with other respiratory illnesses. The 
presence of neutralizing IFN-α2 Abs in critically ill COVID-19 is associated with
delayed viral clearance. IFN-α2 Abs in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors were
not neutralizing in the conditions tested.
