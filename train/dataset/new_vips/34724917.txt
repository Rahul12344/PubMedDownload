BACKGROUND: Countrywide lockdown or stay-at-home order has been implemented to
slow down the transmission of emergent coronavirus. However, the influence on
attitudes and lifestyle due to lockdown amidst the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic has been poorly understood. The present study aimed to
investigate the influence on attitudes and lifestyle due to lockdown amidst the
COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi residents.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey carried out involving 1635 community dwellers
across eight divisions in Bangladesh conducted from April 15, 2020 to May 10,
2020. A structured questionnaire incorporating socio-demographic, attitudes
towards lockdown and adverse lifestyle amidst lockdown measures was employed to
collect data using the Google Forms. Multiple regression analyses were executed
to determine the associated factors of positive attitudes towards lockdown and
adverse lifestyle.
RESULTS: The mean scores of attitudes towards lockdown were 67.9 (SD = 8.4) out
of 85 with an overall correct rate (positive attitudes) of 79.9%; whereas the
mean scores of adverse lifestyle amidst lockdown were 16.1 (SD = 4.8) out of 34
with an overall rate of 47.4%. The factors associated with more positive
attitudes towards lockdown included being female, divorced, higher educated, and 
students. Conversely, being male, having no formal education, and rural residence
were associated factors of adverse lifestyle amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings reflect how the COVID-19 lockdown has preciously
impacted the attitudes, and lifestyle of Bangladeshi citizens, which will
contribute to promoting appropriate measures during a subsequent zonal or
complete lockdown.
