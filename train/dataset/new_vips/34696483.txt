BACKGROUND: Gaps remain in the detection of nucleic acid test (NAT) yield and
occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) by current HBV surface antigen
(HBsAg) assays. The lack of detection may be due to HBsAg levels below current
assay detection limits, mutations affecting HBsAg assays or HBsAg levels, or the 
masking of HBsAg by antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). In this study, we evaluate the 
incremental detection of NAT yield and OBI from five diverse geographic areas by 
an improved sensitivity HBsAg assay and characterize the samples relative to the 
viral load, anti-HBs status, and PreS1-S2-S mutations. Included is a comparison
population with HBV DNA levels comparable to OBI, but with readily detectable
HBsAg (High Surface-Low DNA, HSLD).
METHODS: A total of 347 samples collected from the USA, South Africa, Spain,
Cameroon, Vietnam, and Cote D'Ivoire representing NAT yield (HBsAg(-), antibody
to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc)(-), HBV DNA(+), N = 131), OBI (HBsAg(-),
anti-HBc(+), HBV DNA(+), N = 188), and HSLD (HBsAg(+), anti-HBc(+), HBV DNA(+), N
= 28) were tested with ARCHITECT HBsAg NEXT (HBsAgNx) (sensitivity 0.005 IU/mL). 
The sequencing of the PreS1-S2-S genes from a subset of 177 samples was performed
to determine the genotype and assess amino acid variability, particularly in
anti-HBs(+) samples.
RESULTS: HBsAgNx detected 44/131 (33.6%) NAT yield and 42/188 (22.3%) OBI
samples. Mean HBV DNA levels for NAT yield and OBI samples were lower in
HBsAgNx(-) (50.3 and 25.9 IU/mL) than in HBsAgNx(+) samples (384.1 and 139.5
IU/mL). Anti-HBs â‰¥ 10 mIU/mL was present in 28.6% HBsAgNx(+) and 45.2% HBsAgNx(-)
OBI, and in 3.6% HSLD samples. The genotypes were A1, A2, B, C, D, E, F, and H.
There was no significant difference between HBsAgNx(-) and HBsAgNx(+) in the
proportion of samples harboring substitutions or in the mean number of
substitutions per sample in PreS1, PreS2, or S for the NAT yield or OBI (p range:
0.1231 to >0.9999). A total of 21/27 (77.8%) of HBsAgNx(+) OBI carried S escape
mutations, insertions, or stop codons. HSLD had more PreS1 and fewer S
substitutions compared to both HBsAgNx(-) and HBsAgNx(+) OBI. Mutations/deletions
associated with impaired HBsAg secretion were observed in the OBI group.
CONCLUSIONS: HBsAgNx provides the improved detection of NAT yield and OBI
samples. Samples that remain undetected by HBsAgNx have exceptionally low HBsAg
levels below the assay detection limit, likely due to low viremia or the
suppression of HBsAg expression by host and viral factors.
