African swine fever (ASF) is mainly an acute hemorrhagic disease which is highly 
contagious and lethal to domestic pigs and wild boars. The global pig industry
has suffered significant economic losses due to the lack of an effective vaccine 
and treatment. The African swine fever virus (ASFV) has a large genome of 170-190
kb, encoding more than 150 proteins. During infection, ASFV evades host innate
immunity via multiple viral proteins. A528R is a very important member of the
polygene family of ASFV, which was shown to inhibit IFN-β production by targeting
NF-κB, but its mechanism is not clear. This study has shown that A528R can
suppress the TLR8-NF-κB signaling pathway, including the inhibition of downstream
promoter activity, NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and the
antiviral and antibacterial activity. Further, we found the cellular
co-localization and interaction between A528R and p65, and ANK repeat domains of 
A528R and RHD of p65 are involved in their interaction and the inhibition of p65 
activity. Therefore, we conclude that A528R inhibits TLR8-NF-κB signaling by
targeting p65 activation and nuclear translocation.
