BACKGROUND: Research has been an essential part of the COVID-19 pandemic
response, including in Latin American (LA) countries. However, implementing
research in emergency settings poses the challenge of producing valuable
knowledge rapidly while upholding research ethical standards. Research ethics
committees (RECs) therefore must conduct timely and rigorous ethics reviews and
oversight of COVID-19 research. In the LA region, there is limited knowledge on
how countries have responded to this need. To address this gap, the objective of 
our project is to explore if LA countries developed policies to streamline ethics
review and oversight of research in response to the pandemic while ensuring its
adherence to ethical standards, and to analyze to what extent these governance
frameworks are in accordance with international guidance.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive and exploratory study assessing the COVID-19 
research ethics governance frameworks of 19 LA countries, considering 4
dimensions based on international COVID-19 ethics guidance documents: (i) ethics 
review organizational model adopted, (ii) measures to coordinate between RECs and
other research stakeholders, (iii) operational guidance for RECs, and (iv) key
ethical issues for review and oversight of COVID-19 research.
RESULTS: 10 out of 19 LA countries have some policy to streamline ethics review
of COVID-19 research. Of these countries only 6 issued comprehensive documents
following international guidance that contemplate strategies with recommendations
for concrete actions for a timely and rigorous review.
CONCLUSION: LA countries adopted partial strategies and operational guidance that
may demonstrate a lack of a comprehensive view of research ethics for the review 
and oversight of COVID-19 research. Continuing efforts should be directed to
strengthen LA countries' research capacity to respond timely and ethically to
future health emergencies. Past lessons and the ones from this pandemic should be
the basis to develop international standards and operational guidelines for
ethics review and oversight of any research for public health emergencies.
