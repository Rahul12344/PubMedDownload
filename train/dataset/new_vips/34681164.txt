Dengue virus infection is a global health problem for which there have been
challenges to obtaining a cure. Current vaccines and anti-viral drugs can only be
narrowly applied in ongoing clinical trials. We employed computational methods
based on structure-function relationships between human host kinases and viral
nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) to understand viral replication inhibitors'
therapeutic effect. Phosphorylation at each of the two most evolutionarily
conserved sites of NS3, serine 137 and threonine 189, compared to the
unphosphorylated state were studied with molecular dynamics and docking
simulations. The simulations suggested that phosphorylation at serine 137 caused 
a more remarkable structural change than phosphorylation at threonine 189,
specifically located at amino acid residues 49-95. Docking studies supported the 
idea that phosphorylation at serine 137 increased the binding affinity between
NS3 and nonstructural Protein 5 (NS5), whereas phosphorylation at threonine 189
decreased it. The interaction between NS3 and NS5 is essential for viral
replication. Docking studies with the antiviral plant flavonoid Quercetin with
NS3 indicated that Quercetin physically occluded the serine 137 phosphorylation
site. Taken together, these findings suggested a specific site and mechanism by
which Quercetin inhibits dengue and possible other flaviviruses.
