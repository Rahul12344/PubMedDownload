Members of the family Inoviridae (inoviruses) are characterized by their unique
filamentous morphology and infection cycle. The viral genome of inovirus is able 
to integrate into the host genome and continuously releases virions without
lysing the host, establishing chronic infection. A large number of inoviruses
have been obtained from microbial genomes and metagenomes recently, but putative 
novel inoviruses remaining to be identified. Here, using viral metagenomics, we
identified four novel inoviruses from cloacal swab samples of wild and breeding
birds. The circular genome of those four inoviruses are 6732 to 7709 nt in length
with 51.4% to 56.5% GC content and encodes 9 to 13 open reading frames,
respectively. The zonula occludens toxin gene implicated in the virulence of
pathogenic host bacteria were identified in all four inoviruses and shared the
highest amino acid sequences identity (< 37.3%) to other reference strains
belonging to different genera of the family Inoviridae and among themselves.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the four inoviruses were genetically far
away from other strains belonging to the family Inoviridae and formed an
independent clade. According to the genetic distance-based criteria, all the four
inoviruses identified in the present study respectively belong to four novel
putative genera in the family Inoviridae.
