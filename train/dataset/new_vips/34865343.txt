Whether to initiate antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected
population with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is hot and difficult issue.
Improvements in drug availability and affordability have paved the way for more
data, which may become a medium for confirming whether this population needs
antiviral treatment. Regardless of whether HBeAg is positive or negative, there
are still a considerable number of patients with chronic HBV infection with
normal ALT, who have obvious liver inflammation, fibrosis or cirrhosis and need
to start antiviral therapy. Liver biopsy or non-invasive techniques can be used
as diagnostic tools to begin an early treatment in population with liver fibrosis
and inflammation.
