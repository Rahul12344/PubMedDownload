Our understanding of RNA structure has lagged behind that of proteins and most
other biological polymers, largely because of its ability to adopt multiple, and 
often very different, functional conformations within a single molecule.
Flexibility and multifunctionality appear to be its hallmarks. Conventional
biochemical and biophysical techniques all have limitations in solving RNA
structure and to address this in recent years we have seen the emergence of a
wide diversity of techniques applied to RNA structural analysis and an
accompanying appreciation of its ubiquity and versatility. Viral RNA is a
particularly productive area to study in that this economy of function within a
single molecule admirably suits the minimalist lifestyle of viruses. Here, we
review the major techniques that are being used to elucidate RNA conformational
flexibility and exemplify how the structure and function are, as in all biology, 
tightly linked.
