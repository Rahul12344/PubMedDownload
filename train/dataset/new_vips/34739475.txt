The COVID-19 pandemic era is causing a relevant issue for the health. There is no
specific drug able to antagonize the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a consequence,
there is growing interest about potential molecules able to contrast infection.
In this regard, HMGB, an alarmin, may play a relevant role in pathogenic
mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2. Â As HMGB1 is antagonized by glycyrrhizin, this 
substance could be potentially useful as ancillary treatment in COVID-19.
