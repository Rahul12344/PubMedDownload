More than a third of humanity is currently under containment due to the
coronavirus pandemic. Containment has been in place in many countries for several
weeks. Health authorities are on the warpath against a still mysterious virus and
for which they are brought to inform the population while being confronted with
many unknowns concerning the Covid-19. So what about mental health? What can
generate a situation of containment with the population in quarantine? What
psychological impact will this confinement have on our elderly people who are
accommodated in rest and care homes in Belgium or in Ehpad in France? Currently, 
we are not yet aware of French-language articles already published in the
medical-psychological aspects related to the coronavirus among the population. We
will try, through this article, to approach the medico-psychological question of 
the nursing staff within the nursing homes and the psychological impact of the
residents.
