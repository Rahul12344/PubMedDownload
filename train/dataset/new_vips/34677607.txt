The green rice leafhopper, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler), is an important rice
pest and a vector of the rice dwarf virus in Asia. Here, we produced a
high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of 753.23 Mb using PacBio (∼110×)
and Hi-C data (∼94×). It contained 163 scaffolds and 950 contigs, whose
scaffold/contig N50 lengths reached 85.36/2.57 Mb. And 731.19 Mb (97.07%) of the 
assembly was anchored into eight pseudochromosomes. Genome completeness was
attained to 97.0% according to the insect reference Benchmarking Universal
Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) gene set (n = 1,367). We masked 347.10 Mb (46.08%) 
of the genome as repetitive elements. Nine hundred sixty-two noncoding RNAs were 
identified and 14,337 protein-coding genes were predicted. We also assigned GO
term and KEGG pathway annotations for 10,049 and 9,251 genes, respectively.
Significantly expanded gene families were primarily involved in immunity,
cuticle, digestion, detoxification, and embryonic development. This study
provided a crucial genomic resource for better understanding on the biology and
evolution in family Cicadellidae.
