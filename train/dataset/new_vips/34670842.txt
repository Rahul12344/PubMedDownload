Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
and other pathogens with pandemic potential requires safe, protective,
inexpensive, and easily accessible vaccines that can be developed and
manufactured rapidly at a large scale. DNA vaccines can achieve these criteria,
but induction of strong immune responses has often required bulky, expensive
electroporation devices. Here, we report an ultra-low-cost (<1 USD), handheld
(<50 g) electroporation system utilizing a microneedle electrode array ("ePatch")
for DNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The low cost and small size are achieved 
by combining a thumb-operated piezoelectric pulser derived from a common
household stove lighter that emits microsecond, bipolar, oscillatory electric
pulses and a microneedle electrode array that targets delivery of high electric
field strength pulses to the skin's epidermis. Antibody responses against
SARS-CoV-2 induced by this electroporation system in mice were strong and enabled
at least 10-fold dose sparing compared to conventional intramuscular or
intradermal injection of the DNA vaccine. Vaccination was well tolerated with
mild, transient effects on the skin. This ePatch system is easily portable,
without any battery or other power source supply, offering an attractive,
inexpensive approach for rapid and accessible DNA vaccination to combat COVID-19,
as well as other epidemics.
