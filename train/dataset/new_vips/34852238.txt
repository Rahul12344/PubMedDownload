The human monoclonal antibody (HmAb) C10 potently cross-neutralizes Zika virus
(ZIKV) and dengue virus. Analysis of antibody fragment (Fab) C10 interactions
with ZIKV and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) particles by cryoelectron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
(HDXMS) shows that Fab C10 binding decreases overall ZIKV particle dynamics,
whereas with DENV2, the same Fab causes increased dynamics. Testing of different 
Fab C10:DENV2 E protein molar ratios revealed that, at higher Fab ratios,
especially at saturated concentrations, the Fab enhanced viral dynamics (detected
by HDXMS), and observation under cryo-EM showed increased numbers of distorted
particles. Our results suggest that Fab C10 stabilizes ZIKV but that with DENV2
particles, high Fab C10 occupancy promotes E protein dimer conformational changes
leading to overall increased particle dynamics and distortion of the viral
surface. This is the first instance of a broadly neutralizing antibody eliciting 
virus-specific increases in whole virus particle dynamics.
