The immune system contributes to maintaining the body's functional integrity
through its two main functions: recognizing and destroying foreign external
agents (invading microorganisms) and identifying and eliminating senescent cells 
and damaged or abnormal endogenous entities (such as cellular debris or
misfolded/degraded proteins). Accordingly, the immune system can detect molecular
and cellular structures with a spatial resolution of a few nm, which allows for
detecting molecular patterns expressed in a great variety of pathogens, including
viral and bacterial proteins and bacterial nucleic acid sequences. Such patterns 
are also expressed in abnormal cells. In this context, it is expected that
nanostructured materials in the size range of proteins, protein aggregates, and
viruses with different molecular coatings can engage in a sophisticated
interaction with the immune system. Nanoparticles can be recognized or passed
undetected by the immune system. Once detected, they can be tolerated or induce
defensive (inflammatory) or anti-inflammatory responses. This paper describes the
different modes of interaction between nanoparticles, especially inorganic
nanoparticles, and the immune system, especially the innate immune system. This
perspective should help to propose a set of selection rules for
nanosafety-by-design and medical nanoparticle design.
