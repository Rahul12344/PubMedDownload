Ali-M3, an artificial intelligence program, analyzes chest computed tomography
(CT) and detects the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on scores
ranging from 0 to 1. However, Ali-M3 has not been externally validated. Our aim
was to evaluate the accuracy of Ali-M3 for detecting COVID-19 and discuss its
clinical value. We evaluated the external validity of Ali-M3 using sequential
Japanese sampling data. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection
probabilities for 617 symptomatic patients were determined using Ali-M3. In 11
Japanese tertiary care facilities, these patients underwent reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. They also underwent
chest CT to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 617 patients, 289 (46.8%)
were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a
COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence interval: 0.762â€’0.833) and the
goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156. With a cut-off probability of a diagnosis of
COVID-19 by Ali-M3 set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and
68.3%, respectively. A cut-off of 0.2 yielded a sensitivity and specificity of
89.2% and 43.2%, respectively. Among the 223 patients who required oxygen, the
AUC was 0.825. Sensitivity at a cut-off of 0.5% and 0.2% was 88.7% and 97.9%,
respectively. Although the sensitivity was lower when the days from symptom onset
were fewer, the sensitivity increased for both cut-off values after 5 days. We
evaluated Ali-M3 using external validation with symptomatic patient data from
Japanese tertiary care facilities. As Ali-M3 showed sufficient sensitivity
performance, despite a lower specificity performance, Ali-M3 could be useful in
excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19.

Conflict of interest statement: At the start of the study, Ali-m3 existed as a
tool produced by Alibaba Damo (Hangzhou) Technology Co., Ltd for research use
that had not received any approval. With the results of this study, we have
confirmed that the Ali-M3 has clinical benefits. Therefore, under a special
expedited review in Japan, Ali-M3 has been approved by the Japanese
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and licensed for use as a
diagnostic tool in actual practice. For the license in Japan, Ali-m3 should have 
been a commercial tool. Therefore, it was not planned that M3 Inc would benefit
from the commercialization of the Ali-M3 as a result of our research for which M3
provided the Ali-M3 and storage free of charge. The authors have no patents,
products in development, or marketed products associated with this research to
declare. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials. In Japan, the M3.inc completely held the right of Ali-M3. This
study was utterly free from Alibaba Damo Technology except Alibaba platform by
the right of M3.inc.
