Importance: Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are widely prescribed
globally because of their ability to ameliorate shared immune pathways across
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), the impact of COVID-19 among
individuals with IMIDs who are receiving TNF inhibitors remains insufficiently
understood.
Objective: To examine the association between the receipt of TNF inhibitor
monotherapy and the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization or death compared
with other commonly prescribed immunomodulatory treatment regimens among adult
patients with IMIDs.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was a pooled analysis of
data from 3 international COVID-19 registries comprising individuals with
rheumatic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis from March 12,
2020, to February 1, 2021. Clinicians directly reported COVID-19 outcomes as well
as demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals with IMIDs and
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 using online data entry portals. Adults (age ≥18 
years) with a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or
psoriasis were included.
Exposures: Treatment exposure categories included TNF inhibitor monotherapy
(reference treatment), TNF inhibitors in combination with methotrexate therapy,
TNF inhibitors in combination with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine therapy,
methotrexate monotherapy, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine monotherapy, and Janus
kinase (Jak) inhibitor monotherapy.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was COVID-19-associated
hospitalization or death. Registry-level analyses and a pooled analysis of data
across the 3 registries were conducted using multilevel multivariable logistic
regression models, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics and
accounting for country, calendar month, and registry-level correlations.
Results: A total of 6077 patients from 74 countries were included in the
analyses; of those, 3215 individuals (52.9%) were from Europe, 3563 individuals
(58.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 48.8 (16.5) years. The most common
IMID diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (2146 patients [35.3%]) and Crohn
disease (1537 patients [25.3%]). A total of 1297 patients (21.3%) were
hospitalized, and 189 patients (3.1%) died. In the pooled analysis, compared with
patients who received TNF inhibitor monotherapy, higher odds of hospitalization
or death were observed among those who received a TNF inhibitor in combination
with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine therapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% CI,
1.17-2.58; P = .006), azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine monotherapy (OR, 1.84; 95%
CI, 1.30-2.61; P = .001), methotrexate monotherapy (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.57-2.56; 
P < .001), and Jak inhibitor monotherapy (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.21-2.73; P = .004) 
but not among those who received a TNF inhibitor in combination with methotrexate
therapy (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.85-1.63; P = .33). Similar findings were obtained in
analyses that accounted for potential reporting bias and sensitivity analyses
that excluded patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms alone.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, TNF inhibitor monotherapy was
associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared with other
commonly prescribed immunomodulatory treatment regimens among individuals with
IMIDs.
