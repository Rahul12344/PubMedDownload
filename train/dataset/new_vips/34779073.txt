The PDBsum web server provides structural analyses of the entries in the Protein 
Data Bank (PDB). Two recent additions are described here. The first is the
detailed analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus protein structures in the PDB. These
include the variants of concern, which are shown both on the sequences and 3D
structures of the proteins. The second addition is the inclusion of the available
AlphaFold models for human proteins. The pages allow a search of the protein
against existing structures in the PDB via the Sequence Annotated by Structure
(SAS) server, so one can easily compare the predicted model against
experimentally determined structures. The server is freely accessible to all at
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum.
