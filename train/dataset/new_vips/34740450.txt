BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and oral nucleoside/nucleotide
analogs have been the mainstay of hepatitis B virus (HBV) prophylaxis after liver
transplantation. However, long-term HBIG administration could have disadvantages,
such as an increase in medical costs and the development of mutant HBV strains.
This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of HBV vaccination after 
the withdrawal of HBIG after liver transplantation.
METHODS: This prospective open-label single-arm observational clinical trial
enrolled 41 patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2010 and 2016
because of a condition related to chronic HBV infection. At the time of
enrollment, all patients had taken entecavir and discontinued HBIG
administration. When hepatitis B surface antibody titer was undetectable after
the withdrawal of HBIG, a recombinant HBV vaccine was injected intramuscularly at
month 0, 1, and 6.
RESULTS: After excluding 5 patients who dropped out and 2 patients who had a
persistent hepatitis B surface antibody titer, 9 (26.5%) of 34 patients had a
positive vaccination response. The median hepatitis B surface antibody titer at
seroconversion was 86 (12-1000) IU/L, and those at the end of follow-up were 216 
(30-1000) IU/L. No patients experienced HBV recurrence during the study period.
Sex (female, odds ratio 32.91 [1.83-592.54], P = .018) and the dosing interval of
HBIG before withdrawal (≥90 days, 16.21 [1.21-217.31], P = .035) were independent
contributing factors for positive response to the vaccination.
CONCLUSION: HBV vaccination still deserves consideration as active
immunoprophylaxis after liver transplantation because it could provide added
immunity to nucleoside/nucleotide analogs monotherapy with excellent
cost-effectiveness.
