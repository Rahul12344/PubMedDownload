PURPOSE: To evaluate perceived access to health care and preferences for health
care provision among patients (being) treated for breast cancer during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Longitudinal study within the prospective, multicenter UMBRELLA cohort
of patients (being) treated for breast cancer. All cohort participants enrolled
in UMBRELLA between October 2013 and November 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific 
survey during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., April
2020 and November 2020, respectively.
RESULTS: In total, 1106 (69.3%) and 822 (50.9%) cohort participants completed the
survey in the first and second wave, respectively. The proportion of patients
experiencing that their treatment or follow-up care was affected due to COVID-19 
decreased from 28.4% (n = 198) in April 2020 to 14.8% (n = 103) in November 2020.
Throughout the pandemic, one or more hospital consultations were postponed in
10.0% (n = 82) of all patients and changed into a teleconsultation in 23.1%
(n = 190). The proportion of patients who experienced a higher threshold to
contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19 decreased from 29.9% (n = 204)
in the first wave to 20.8% (n = 145) in the second wave. In-person consultations 
remained most preferred in 35.2% (n = 289) of all patients. Nearly half of all
patients (48.3%, n = 396) indicated that telehealth would be a useful alternative
for in-person consultations in future.
CONCLUSION: Perceived access to health care has improved substantially throughout
the pandemic. Digital care is well received by patients (being) treated for
breast cancer.
