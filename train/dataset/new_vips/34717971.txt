Extensive glycosylation of viral glycoproteins is a key feature of the antigenic 
surface of viruses and yet glycan processing can also be influenced by the manner
of their recombinant production. The low yields of the soluble form of the
trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 has prompted advances in protein 
engineering that have greatly enhanced the stability and yields of the
glycoprotein. The latest expression-enhanced version of the spike incorporates
six proline substitutions to stabilize the prefusion conformation (termed
SARS-CoV-2 S HexaPro). Although the substitutions greatly enhanced expression
whilst not compromising protein structure, the influence of these substitutions
on glycan processing has not been explored. Here, we show that the site-specific 
N-linked glycosylation of the expression-enhanced HexaPro resembles that of an
earlier version containing two proline substitutions (2P), and that both capture 
features of native viral glycosylation. However, there are site-specific
differences in glycosylation of HexaPro when compared to 2P. Despite these
discrepancies, analysis of the serological reactivity of clinical samples from
infected individuals confirmed that both HexaPro and 2P protein are equally able 
to detect IgG, IgA, and IgM responses in all sera analysed. Moreover, we extend
this observation to include an analysis of glycan engineered S protein, whereby
all N-linked glycans were converted to oligomannose-type and conclude that
serological activity is not impacted by large scale changes in glycosylation.
These observations suggest that variations in glycan processing will not impact
the serological assessments currently being performed across the globe.
