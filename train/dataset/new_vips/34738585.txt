BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a global public health concern
globally. Even though Healthcare Workers (HCWs) are supposedly at increased risk 
for SARS-CoV-2 infection, to date no pooled evidence has been collected.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched online electronic databases (PubMed, Embase,
medRxiv.org for pre-prints) for all available contribution (up to May 20, 2019). 
Two Authors independently screened articles and extracted the data. The pooled
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using the random-effects model. The
possible sources of heterogeneity were analyzed through subgroup analysis, and
meta-regression.
RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.5% (95%CI 1.8-6.6) for
studies based on molecular assays, 5.5% (95%CI 2.1-14.1) for studies based on
serological assays, and 6.5% (95%CI 2.5-15.6) for point-of-care capillary blood
tests. Among subgroups, serological tests identified higher risk for SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity in physicians than in nurses (OR 1.436, 95%CI 1.026 to 2.008).
Regression analysis indicated the possible presence of publication bias only for 
molecular tests (t -3.3526, p-value 0.002648).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall pooled prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was lower than
previously expected, but available studies were affected by significant
heterogeneity, and the molecular studies by significant publication bias.
Therefore, further high-quality research in the field is warranted.
