The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine healthcare services. Hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are often asymptomatic, and
therefore, screening and on/post-treatment monitoring are required. Our aim was
to determine the effect of the first, second and third waves of the pandemic on
HBV and HCV testing in Ontario, Canada. We extracted data from Public Health
Ontario for HBV and HCV specimens from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2021. Testing
volumes were evaluated and stratified by age, sex and region. Changes in testing 
volumes were analysed by per cent and absolute change. Testing volumes decreased 
in April 2020 with the first wave of the pandemic and recovered to 72%-75% of
prepandemic volumes by the end of the first wave. HBsAg testing decreased by 33%,
18% and 15%, and HBV DNA testing decreased by 37%, 27% and 20%, in each
consecutive wave. Anti-HCV testing decreased by 35%, 21% and 19%, and HCV RNA
testing decreased by 44%, 30% and 36% in each consecutive wave. These trends were
consistent by age, region and sex. Prenatal HBV testing volumes were stable. In
conclusion, significant decreases in HBV and HCV testing occurred during the
first three waves of the pandemic and have not recovered. In addition to direct
consequences on viral hepatitis elimination efforts, these data provide insight
into the impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease screening and management.
Strategies to make up for missed testing will be critical to avoid additional
consequences of COVID-19 long after the pandemic has resolved.
