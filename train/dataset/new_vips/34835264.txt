Chronic hepatitis B affects more than 250 million individuals worldwide, putting 
them at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. While antiviral
immune responses are key to eliminating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections,
insufficient antiviral immunity characterized by failure to eliminate
HBV-infected hepatocytes is associated with chronic hepatitis B. Prophylactic
vaccination against hepatitis B successfully established protective immunity
against infection with the hepatitis B virus and has been instrumental in
controlling hepatitis B. However, prophylactic vaccination schemes have not been 
successful in mounting protective immunity to eliminate HBV infections in
patients with chronic hepatitis B. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on the 
development and efficacy of therapeutic vaccination strategies against chronic
hepatitis B with particular emphasis on the pathogenetic understanding of
dysfunctional anti-viral immunity. We explore the development of additional
immune stimulation measures within tissues, in particular activation of
immunogenic myeloid cell populations, and their use for combination with
therapeutic vaccination strategies to improve the efficacy of therapeutic
vaccination against chronic hepatitis B.
