This article presents that the use of music like "A Prayer for Nation" during the
COVID-19 outbreak is an alternative healing medicine helping people to reduce
their loneliness, depression, stress, and anxiety. In a multicultural,
pluralistic country like Indonesia, this song has the pastoral power to uplift,
unite, and heal.
