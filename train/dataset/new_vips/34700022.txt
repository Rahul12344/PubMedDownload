The silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a domesticated and economically important insect.
During the whole growth period, silkworm suffers various pathogen infection.
Nearly 80% of silk cocoon crop losses are attributed to viral diseases. The
circular double-stranded DNA virus Bombyx mori nuclepolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is the
major viral pathogen responsible for massive silkworm death and huge economic
losses in the sericulture industry. Up to now, almost all the new strategies for 
developing immunity against BmNPV are in laboratory strains because of the lack
of transgenic technology in industrial silkworm strains. We previously
demonstrated that modification of BmNPV genome DNA with the antivirus transgenic 
CRISPR/Cas9 system effectively improved the resistance of laboratory silkworm
strains to viral pathogens. The industrial strains are monovoltine or bivoltine. 
It is very difficult to break the diapause before microinjection for genetic
transformation. Here, we show that the anti-BmNPV transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 system
also works in the industrial silkworm strain Jingsong. In this study, we
successfully broke diapause and obtained generation-skipping embryos and
constructed two TG Jingsong lines. Both lines exhibited significantly enhanced
immunity to BmNPV without significant changes in most of the commercially
important traits. These results demonstrate that the construction of TG silkworm 
lines carrying a heritable immune defense system against BmNPV could be an
effective strategy to enhance the resistance of industrial silkworm strains to
the most devastating DNA virus. The research opened a window for genetic
modification of the important strains from laboratory strains to industrial
strains.
