Plant vascular systems can translocate the entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis 
from the soil into plant tissues. However, whether other soil dwelling
entomopathogens utilize plant vascular tissue for movement has not yet been fully
explored. We used Spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV) to
evaluate whether baculoviruses, a common entomopathogen and bioinsecticide, can
be transported through the plant vascular pathways of Zea mays. We found that our
treatments did not allow a sufficient virus translocation into the plant to
induce a lethal infection in insects, which was confirmed by a molecular
analysis. While other entomopathogens translocate, baculoviruses may not be one
of them.
