The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic continues during 2021. Some countries are revisiting
their containment measures to be eased or re-imposed after massive testing
programs. Yet is testing itself a solution? Testing may be an important
containment step, yet in low-income countries (LICs), it may be substantially
challenging to carry out. This is because the situation in LICs is complexified
by inadequate and corrupt economic, political, and healthcare systems in which
testing is often beyond reach. Focusing on Pakistan and Papua New Guinea (PNG),
we contend that the sparse number of recorded COVID-19 infections may demonstrate
that both countries lack the required resources to conduct effective testing and 
deal with the pandemic. To appropriately tackle the pandemic, such countries need
focus on implementing the measures they can and on public education about how
viruses work and why it is so important to seek to contain their spread.
Furthermore, we invite thorough studies to examine and analyze massive testing
from various perspectives.
