Lassa hemorrhagic fever, caused by Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) infection,
accumulates up to 5000 deaths every year. Currently, there is no vaccine
available to combat this disease. In this study, a library of 200 bioactive
compounds was virtually screened to study their drug-likeness with the capacity
to block the α-dystroglycan (α-DG) receptor and prevent LASV influx. Following
rigorous absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) profiling, molecular docking 
was conducted with the top ligands against the α-DG receptor. The compounds
chrysin, reticuline, and 3-caffeoylshikimic acid emerged as the top three ligands
in terms of binding affinity. Post-docking analysis revealed that interactions
with Arg76, Asn224, Ser259, and Lys302 amino acid residues of the receptor
protein were important for the optimum binding affinity of ligands. Molecular
dynamics simulation was performed comprehensively to study the stability of the
protein-ligand complexes. In-depth assessment of root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), polar surface area (PSA), B-Factor, 
radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and molecular
surface area (MolSA) values of the protein-ligand complexes affirmed that the
candidates with the best binding affinity formed the most stable protein-ligand
complexes. To authenticate the potentialities of the ligands as target-specific
drugs, an in vivo study is underway in real time as the continuation of the
research.
