The emergence of the COVID-19 viral pandemic has generated a renewed interest in 
pharmacologic agents that target the renin angiotensin system (RAS).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors decrease the synthesis of
angiotensin II (Ang II) from its precursor angiotensin I and inhibit the
breakdown of bradykinin, while Ang II receptor blockers antagonize the action of 
Ang II at the receptor level downstream. The actions of both classes of drugs
lead to vasodilation, a blunting of sympathetic drive and a reduction in
aldosterone release, all beneficial effects in hypertension and congestive heart 
failure. ACE2 cleaves the vasoconstrictor Ang II to produce the anti-inflammatory
cytoprotective angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) peptide, which functions through the G
protein-coupled receptor MAS to counteract the pathophysiologic effects induced
by Ang II via its receptors, including vasoconstriction, inflammation,
hypercoagulation, and fibrosis. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding ACE2 on 
the cell surface, decreases ACE2 activity, competes for ACE2 receptor-binding
sites, and shifts the RAS toward an overexpression of Ang II, accounting for many
of the deleterious effects of the virus. Thus, there is great interest in
developing recombinant ACE2 as a therapeutic for prevention or treatment of
COVID-19. Notably, ACE2 is highly expressed in the oral cavity, and saliva and
dorsum of the tongue are major reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Cost-effective methods
to debulk the virus in the oral cavity may aid in the prevention of viral spread.
Here we review the pharmacology of targeted small molecule inhibitors of the RAS 
and discuss novel approaches to employing ACE2 as a therapeutic for COVID-19.
