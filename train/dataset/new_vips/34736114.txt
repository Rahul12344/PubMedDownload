In an aim of developing portable biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which
facilitates the point-of-care aptasensing, a strategy using 10 μm gap-sized gold 
interdigitated electrode (AuIDE) is presented. The silane-modified AuIDE surface 
was deposited with ∼20 nm diamond and enhanced the detection of SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein (NCP). The characteristics of chemically modified diamond
were evidenced by structural analyses, revealing the cubic crystalline nature at 
(220) and (111) planes as observed by XRD. XPS analysis denotes a strong
interaction of carbon element, composed ∼95% as seen in EDS analysis. The C-C,
CC, CO, CN functional groups were well-refuted from XPS spectra of carbon and
oxygen elements in diamond. The interrelation between elements through FTIR
analysis indicates major intrinsic bondings at 2687-2031 cm-1. The aptasensing
was evaluated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, using 
NCP spiked human serum. With a good selectivity the lower detection limit was
evidenced as 0.389 fM, at a linear detection range from 1 fM to 100 pM. The
stability, and reusability of the aptasensor were demonstrated, showing ∼30% and 
∼33% loss of active state, respectively, after ∼11 days. The detection of NCP was
evaluated by comparing anti-NCP aptamer and antibody as the bioprobes. The
determination coefficients of R2 = 0.9759 and R2 = 0.9772 were obtained for
aptamer- and antibody-based sensing, respectively. Moreover, the genuine
interaction of NCP aptamer and protein was validated by enzyme linked
apta-sorbent assay. The aptasensing strategy proposed with AuIDE/diamond enhanced
sensing platform is highly recommended for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
