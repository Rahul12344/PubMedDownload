Even several months after the start of a massive vaccination campaign against
COVID-19, mortality and hospital admission are still high in many countries.
Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are the ideal complement to vaccination 
in infected subjects who are at high risk for progression to severe disease.
Based on data of the Italian Ministry of Health, in the period April-August 2021,
monoclonal antibodies were prescribed to 6322 patients. In the same period,
70,022 patients over 70 years old became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Even
considering that all monoclonal antibodies were prescribed to this category of
patients, we calculated that only 9% of these subjects received the treatment.
Moreover, using efficacy data provided by clinal trials, we estimated the
potential benefit in terms of reduction of hospital admissions and deaths.
Considering utilisation of monoclonal antibodies in half infected patients over
70 years, we estimated that hospital admissions and deaths might have been
reduced by 7666 and 3507, respectively. Finally, we calculated the economic
benefit of monoclonal use. In the same scenario (50% use of monoclonal antibodies
to patients over 70), we estimated potential savings of USD 117,410,105. In
conclusion, monoclonal antibodies were used in a small proportion of patients
over 70 in Italy. A more extensive use might have resulted in a marked decrease
in hospital admissions, deaths and in conspicuous saving for the health system.
