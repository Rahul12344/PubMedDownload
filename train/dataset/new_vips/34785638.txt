Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a range of epithelial and B cell
malignancies as well as autoimmune disorders, for which there are still no
specific treatments or effective vaccines. Here, we isolate EBV gH/gL-specific
antibodies from an EBV-infected individual. One antibody, 1D8, efficiently
neutralizes EBV infection of two major target cell types, B cells and epithelial 
cells. In humanized mice, 1D8 provides protection against a high-dose EBV
challenge by substantially reducing viral loads and associated tumor burden.
Crystal structure analysis reveals that 1D8 binds to a key vulnerable interface
between the D-I/D-II domains of the viral gH/gL protein, especially the D-II of
the gH, thereby interfering with the gH/gL-mediated membrane fusion and binding
to target cells. Overall, we identify a potent and protective neutralizing
antibody capable of reducing the EBV load. The novel vulnerable site represents
an attractive target that is potentially important for antibody and vaccine
intervention against EBV infection.
