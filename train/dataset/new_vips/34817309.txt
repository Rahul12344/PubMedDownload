INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious and deadly coronavirus whose
study requires the use of a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment facility to
investigate viral biology and pathogenesis, which limits the study of live virus 
and slows progress toward finding suitable treatments for infection. While
vaccines from several companies have proven very effective in combating the
virus, few treatments exist for those who do succumb to the viral-induced
systemic disease called COVID-19.
AREAS COVERED: This short review focuses on fluorescent quantum dot-based
modeling of SARS-CoV-2. New BSL-2 viral models are essential for finding small
molecules and biologics that may be effective in stopping viral infection, as
well as treating already infected individuals. Nanoparticles are invaluable tools
for biological research as they can be used to both model pathogens and serve as 
a platform for developing vaccines.
EXPERT OPINION: Visualizing viral activity with fluorescent quantum dots enables 
both biochemical and cell-based assays to detect virus-host receptor
interactions, cellular activity after binding to the cell plasma membrane,
screening for interventions using small-molecule drug repurposing, and testing of
novel biologics. Quantum dots can also be used for diagnostic assays, vaccine
development, and importantly, pan-antiviral drugs to address variants that may
escape the immune response.
