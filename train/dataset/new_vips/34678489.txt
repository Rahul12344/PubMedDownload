Human herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) belong to the Herpesviridae family. At
present, no vaccine or curative treatment is available for the prevention of HSV 
infections. Here, we review the cell surface receptors that are recognized by
HSV's glycoprotein B, glycoprotein C, glycoprotein D, and the glycoprotein H -
glycoprotein L complex to facilitate entry into host cells. These receptors
include heparan sulfate (HS), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), and nectin-1/-2,
3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate (3-OS HS).
