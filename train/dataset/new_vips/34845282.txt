The effect of respiratory infectious diseases on STEMI incidence, but also STEMI 
care is not well understood. The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and the COVID-19
pandemic were chosen as observational periods to investigate the effect of
respiratory virus diseases on these outcomes in a metropolitan area with an
established STEMI network. We analyzed data on incidence and care during the
COVID-19 pandemic, Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and corresponding seasonal
control periods. Three comparisons were performed: (1) COVID-19 pandemic group
versus pandemic control group, (2) COVID-19 pandemic group versus Influenza
2017/2018 epidemic group and (3) Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group versus
epidemic control group. We used Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test and Chi
square test for statistical analysis. 1455 patients were eligible. The daily
STEMI incidence was 1.49 during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1.40 for the pandemic
season control period, 1.22 during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and 1.28
during the epidemic season control group. Median symptom-to-contact time was
180 min during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the pandemic season control group it was
90 min (p = 0.183), and in the Influenza 2017/2018 cohort it was 90 min, too
(p = 0.216). Interval in the epidemic control group was 79 min (p = 0.733). The
COVID-19 group had a door-to-balloon time of 49 min, corresponding intervals were
39 min for the pandemic season group (p = 0.038), 37 min for the Influenza
2017/2018 group (p = 0.421), and 38 min for the epidemic season control group
(p = 0.429). In-hospital mortality was 6.1% for the COVID-19 group, 5.9% for the 
Influenza 2017/2018 group (p = 1.0), 11% and 11.2% for the season control groups.
The respiratory virus diseases neither resulted in an overall treatment delay,
nor did they cause an increase in STEMI mortality or incidence. The registry
analysis demonstrated a prolonged door-to-balloon time during the COVID-19
pandemic.
