Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
novel coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. The majority of medullary
thyroid cancers present as a thyroid nodule. At the time of diagnosis, cervical
lymph nodes and distant metastases are frequently detected.
Case Report: Here, we present a case of a 46-year-old man with coronavirus
disease (COVID) pneumonia, who had persistently high serum procalcitonin levels
despite normal C-reactive protein levels. The attending infectologist happened to
be a colleague who spent some time, as part of her internal medicine rotation, in
the Endocrine Ward and recalled that medullary thyroid cancer might be the cause.
This led to the timely workup and treatment of the medullary cancer.
