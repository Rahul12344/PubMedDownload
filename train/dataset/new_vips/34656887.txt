We present a case of brain death in a vaccinated, immunocompromised patient who
presented with COVID-19 pneumonia. Imaging was characterized by diffuse cerebral 
edema, pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage, and no antegrade flow above the terminal
internal carotid arteries. To our knowledge, this is the first case report with
such findings in a vaccinated patient.
