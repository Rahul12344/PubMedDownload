The aim of this article is to identify quality improvement nursing strategies
that have been implemented to safeguard COVID-19 patients from harm while being
cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU). This article incorporates a
literature review on the experiences of nurses working at a large urban teaching 
hospital in the areas of critical care, quality, safety, and regulatory. As
leaders in the delivery of health care, nurses have always pioneered innovative
ways to deliver care despite difficult circumstances. COVID-19 is a novel viral
disease with many unknowns, and it required nurses to integrate innovative
approaches with evidence-based practice in order to meet the needs of the patient
and to ensure patient safety. While in the critical care setting, COVID-19
patients are at an increased risk for various hospital-acquired injuries, threats
to personal safety, and decline in mental health. Through ingenuity and
adaptability, successful nursing strategies have been identified in the delivery 
of quality, evidence-based nursing care to safeguard the vulnerable COVID-19
patient population from harm while in the ICU.
