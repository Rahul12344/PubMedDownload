Activation of nucleic acid sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in B cells is
involved in antiviral responses by promoting B cell activation and germinal
center responses. In order to take advantage of this natural pathway for vaccine 
development, synthetic pathogen-like antigens (PLAs) constructed of multivalent
antigens with encapsulated TLR ligands can be used to activate B cell antigen
receptors and TLRs in a synergistic manner. Here we report a PLA-based
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate designed by combining a
phage-derived virus-like particle carrying bacterial RNA as TLR ligands with the 
receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) S protein as the target antigen. This PLA-based vaccine candidate
induces robust neutralizing antibodies in both mice and non-human primates
(NHPs). Using a NHP infection model, we demonstrate that the viral clearance is
accelerated in vaccinated animals. In addition, the PLA-based vaccine induces a T
helper 1 (Th1)-oriented response and a durable memory, supporting its potential
for further clinical development.
