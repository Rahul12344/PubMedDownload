To meet the present and future challenges in achieving therapeutic in vivo gene
delivery using adeno-associated virus (AAV), new innovations are required that
integrate knowledge from disciplines ranging from biomaterials science, drug
delivery, immunobiology, to tissue engineering. One of the foremost challenges
remaining is in addressing pre-existing and therapy induced immune responses to
AAV which significantly limit its therapeutic effect. In addition, functional
correction of diseased tissues will depend on the ability of AAVs to retain
activity after local or systemic administration and broadly distribute in target 
tissues. In this contribution to the Orations - New Horizons of the Journal of
Controlled Release, I will introduce new concepts and potential strategies
pursued by our lab and others to better understand and overcome these hurdles to 
effective AAV gene therapy. These multi-disciplinary approaches may open the door
to the creation of precision gene therapies to treat heavily burdensome and often
deadly diseases.
