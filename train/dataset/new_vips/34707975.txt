Following civil war and the Ebola epidemic, Liberia's health workforce was
devastated, essential health services and primary care were disrupted, and health
outcomes for maternal and child mortality were amongst the worst in the world. To
reverse these trends, the government of Liberia developed the Health Workforce
Program (HWP) Strategy 2015-2021. With the goal of building a resilient and
responsive health system to ensure access to essential services and the ability
to respond to future crises, this strategy aimed to add 6,000 new professionals
to the workforce. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share lessons
learned from the program's development and first years of implementation.
