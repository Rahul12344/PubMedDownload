INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has affected healthcare services around the globe
as hospitals were turned into designated hospitals to accommodate high risk
groups of patients with COVID-19 infection including end stage kidney disease
(ESKD) patients. In Malaysia, there was insufficient data on COVID-19 infection
among ESKD patients. This study aims to determine factors and survival outcomes
associated with COVID-19 infection among ESKD patients in a designated COVID-19
hospital in Malaysia.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective cross-sectional study involving 80
haemodialysis (HD) patients recruited from March 2020 till March 2021. Patients' 
information and results was retrieved and evaluated. Risk factors affecting the
COVID-19 mortality were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54 years who were predominantly Malays 
(87.5%) and living in rural areas. Majority of them had comorbidities such as
diabetes mellitus (71%) and hypertension (90%). The most common presentations
were fever (46%) and cough (54%) with chest radiographs showing bilateral lower
zone ground glass opacities (45%). A quarter of the study population were
admitted to the intensive care unit, necessitating mechanical ventilation. This
study found that 51% of the patients were given steroids and 45% required oxygen 
supplementation. The COVID-19 infection mortality among the study population was 
12.5%. Simple logistic regression analysis showed that albumin, Odd Ratio,
OR=0.85 (95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.98)) and absolute lymphocyte
count OR=0.08 (95%CI: 0.11, 0.56) have inverse association with COVID-19
mortality. C-reactive protein OR=1.02 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.04), lactate dehydrogenase 
OR=1.01 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.01), mechanical ventilation OR=17.21 (95%CI: 3.03, 97.67)
and high dose steroids OR=15.71 (95%CI: 1.80, 137.42) were directly associated
with COVID-19 mortality.
CONCLUSION: The high mortality rate among ESKD patients receiving HD was
alarming. This warrants additional infection control measures to prevent the
spread of COVID- 19 infection among this vulnerable group of patients. Expediting
vaccination efforts in this group of patients should be advocated to reduce the
incidence of complications from COVID-19 infection.
