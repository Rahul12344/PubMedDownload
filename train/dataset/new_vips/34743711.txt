The COVID-19 infection control and prevention measures have contributed to the
increase in incidence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and negatively impacted 
access to health and legal systems. The purpose of this commentary is to
highlight the legal context in relation to IPV, and impact of COVID-19 on IPV
survivors and IPV prevention and response services in Kenya, Malawi, and Sudan.
Whereas Kenya and Malawi have ratified the Convention on Elimination of all forms
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and have laws against IPV, Sudan has yet 
to ratify the convention and lacks laws against IPV. Survivors of IPV in Kenya,
Malawi and Sudan have limited access to quality health care, legal and
psychosocial support services due to COVID-19 infection control and prevention
measures. The existence of laws in Kenya and Malawi, which have culminated into
establishment of IPV services, allows a sizable portion of the population to
access IPV services in the pandemic period albeit sub-optimal. The lack of laws
in Sudan means that IPV services are hardly available and as such, a minimal
proportion of the population can access services. Civil society's push in Kenya
has led to prioritisation of IPV services. Thus, a vibrant civil society,
committed governments and favourable IPV laws, can lead to better IPV services
during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
