BACKGROUND: Despite antiviral therapy, liver function often fails to recover in
patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related decompensated cirrhosis.
AIM: To establish a prognostic model to predict re-compensation in patients
starting potent nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) therapy METHODS: We analysed 311
consecutive patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis treated with
entecavir or tenofovir. The primary outcome was re-compensation, defined as
recovery to a Child-Pugh score of 5. The BC2AID score was developed from a cohort
of 152 subjects based on competing risk models and validated in another cohort of
159 subjects.
RESULTS: Re-compensation occurred in 57.2% and 66.7% of the subjects in the
derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six independent predictors for
re-compensation were identified in the derivation cohort and these comprised the 
BC2AID score: bilirubin ≤5 mg/dL (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]
2.18), absence of severe complications (aSHR 2.78), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
≥50 ng/mL (aSHR 2.54), alanine aminotransferase ≥200 IU/L (aSHR 2.62),
international normalised ratio ≤1.5 (aSHR 2.37) and ≤6 months from initial
decompensation until initiation of NUCs (aSHR 4.79). In the validation cohort,
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the BC2AID score
for re-compensation within 1 year of NUC therapy was significantly higher than
that of the Child-Pugh, MELD, MELDNa and BE3A scores (0.813 vs 0.691, 0.638,
0.645 and 0.624, respectively; all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Six clinical parameters, including AFP and the timing of antiviral
therapy, were combined into a scoring system to accurately predict early
re-compensation in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.
