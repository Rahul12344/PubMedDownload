BACKGROUND: During previous pandemics people who use drugs (PWUD) were
categorized among the most vulnerable. In the current study, firstly, we wanted
to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the prevalence of anxiety and
depressive disorders among PWUD. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the prevalence
of these disorders with that of members from the general population who did not
use drugs.
METHODS: We used a matched cohort design based on two separate repeated
cross-sectional online surveys (April and November 2020) among PWUD and the
general population. Results of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used as outcome variables. We
calculated absolute and relative risks for matched pairs for both affective
disorders, and logistic regression to compare affective disorders over both waves
for PWUD.
RESULTS: In April, the prevalence of affective disorders was similar for PWUD and
the general population. In November, the risks for anxiety disorders increased
with 64% for PWUD compared to non-PWUD (RR = 1.64, 95%CI 1.42-1.88), whereas the 
risks for depressive disorders more than doubled (RR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.97-2.67).
Having a job and being male were protective factors for PWUD for both anxiety and
depressive disorders.
LIMITATIONS: As this study used self-reported data, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 give an
indication of the presence of anxiety and depression which might differ from a
clinician's judgement.
CONCLUSIONS: PWUD might be disproportionally affected by COVID-19. Health care
providers should be attentive to substance use as an indicator for increased risk
of mental health problems.
