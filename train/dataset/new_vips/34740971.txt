Inflammation in the epididymis and testis contributes significantly to male
infertility. Alternative therapeutic avenues treating epididymitis and orchitis
are expected since current therapies using antibiotics have limitations
associated to side effects and are commonly ineffective for inflammation due to
nonbacterial causes. Here, we demonstrated that type 1 parathyroid hormone
receptor (PTH1R) and its endogenous agonists, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
PTH-related protein (PTHrP), were mainly expressed in the Leydig cells of testis 
as well as epididymal epithelial cells. Screening the secretin family G
protein-coupled receptor identified that PTH1R in the epididymis and testis was
down-regulated in mumps virus (MuV)- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
inflammation. Remarkably, activation of PTH1R by abaloparatide (ABL), a Food and 
Drug Administration-approved treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis,
alleviated MuV- or LPS-induced inflammatory responses in both testis and
epididymis and significantly improved sperm functions in both mouse model and
human samples. The anti-inflammatory effects of ABL were shown to be regulated
mainly through the Gq and β-arrestin-1 pathway downstream of PTH1R as supported
by the application of ABL in Gnaq ± and Arrb1 -/- mouse models. Taken together,
our results identified an important immunoregulatory role for PTH1R signaling in 
the epididymis and testis. Targeting to PTH1R might have a therapeutic effect for
the treatment of epididymitis and orchitis or other inflammatory disease in the
male reproductive system.
