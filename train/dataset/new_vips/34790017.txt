BACKGROUND: Various liver and gastrointestinal involvements occur in patients
with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at variable prevalence. Most studies
report mild liver function disturbances correlated with COVID-19 severity, though
liver failure is unusual.
AIM: To study liver and gastrointestinal dysfunctions in Egyptian patients with
COVID-19 and their relation to disease outcomes.
METHODS: This multicentre cohort study was conducted on 547 Egyptian patients
from April 15, 2020 to July 29, 2020. Consecutive polymerase chain
reaction-confirmed COVID-19 cases were included from four quarantine hospitals
affiliated to the Egyptian ministry of health. Demographic information,
laboratory characteristics, treatments, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, COVID-19
severity, and outcomes were recorded and compared according to the degree of
liver enzyme elevation and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Follow-ups 
were conducted until discharge or death. Regression analyses were performed to
determine the independent factors affecting mortality.
RESULTS: This study included 547 patients, of whom 53 (9.68%) died during
hospitalization and 1 was discharged upon his request. Patients' mean age was
45.04 ± 17.61 years, and 21.98% had severe or critical COVID-19. Alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were available for
430 and 428 patients, respectively. In total, 26% and 32% of patients had
elevated ALT and AST, respectively. Significant liver injury with ALT or AST
elevation exceeding 3-fold was recorded in 21 (4.91%) and 16 (3.73%) patients,
respectively. Male gender, smoking, hypertension, chronic hepatitis C, and lung
involvement were associated with elevated AST or ALT. AST was elevated in 50% of 
patients over 60-years-old. FIB-4 was significantly higher in patients admitted
to the intensive care unit (ICU), those with more severe COVID-19, and
non-survivors. The independent variables affecting outcome were supplementary
vitamin C intake (1 g daily capsules) [odds ratio (OR): 0.05, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.008-0.337]; lung consolidation (OR: 4.540, 95%CI: 1.155-17.840);
ICU admission (OR: 25.032, 95%CI: 7.110-88.128); and FIB-4 score > 3.25 (OR:
10.393, 95%CI: 2.459-43.925). Among 60 (13.98%) patients with gastrointestinal
symptoms, 52 (86.67%) had diarrhoea. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were
predominantly females with higher body mass index, and 50 (83.40%) patients had
non-severe COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: Few Egyptian patients with COVID-19 developed a significant liver
injury. The independent variables affecting mortality were supplementary vitamin 
C intake, lung consolidation, ICU admission, and FIB-4 score.
