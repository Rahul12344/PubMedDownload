A 33-year-old woman developed palindromic rheumatism (PLR) several weeks
following an infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Three months later, she developed full blown seropositive
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) following COVID-19 reinfection. Although the occurrence
of the joint diseases and the COVID-19 infections maybe fortuitous, knowing the
enormous effects of COVID-19 infection on the human immune system, it is
difficult to ignore the temporal relationship between the appearance of PLR after
the first COVID-19 infection and the transition to full blown RA following her
COVID-19 re-infection.
