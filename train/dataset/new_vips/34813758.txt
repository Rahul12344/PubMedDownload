Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are specialized proteases that remove ubiquitin from
substrates or cleave within ubiquitin chains to regulate ubiquitylation and
therefore play important roles in eukaryotic biology. Dysregulation of DUBs is
implicated in several human diseases, highlighting the importance of DUB
function. In addition, many pathogenic bacteria and viruses encode and deploy
DUBs to manipulate host immune responses and establish infectious diseases in
humans and animals. Hence, therapeutic targeting of DUBs is an increasingly
explored area that requires an in-depth mechanistic understanding of human and
pathogenic DUBs. In this review, we summarize the multiple layers of regulation
that control autoinhibition, activation, and substrate specificity of DUBs. We
discuss different strategies to inhibit DUBs and the progress in developing
selective small-molecule DUB inhibitors. Finally, we propose a classification
system of DUB inhibitors based on their mode of action.
