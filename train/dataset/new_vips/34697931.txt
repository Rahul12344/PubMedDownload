The present study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes
between pregnant women and non-pregnant women of childbearing age (20-49 years
old) diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the initial stage 
of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Korea. This nationwide observational 
study included the information of COVID-19 patients collected by the Korea
Disease Control and Prevention Agency from January 2020 to April 2021. Among
5,647 COVID-19 patients, 2,444 (43.3%) were women of childbearing age and 19 were
pregnant. None of the pregnant women died. However, 4 deaths occurred among
non-pregnant women aged 20-49 years. None of the 19 pregnant women with COVID-19 
were admitted to the intensive care unit: they were admitted to the general ward,
and none of them required supplemental oxygen. In conclusion, none of the
pregnant women with COVID-19 experienced severe infection or death, unlike
non-pregnant women of childbearing age.
