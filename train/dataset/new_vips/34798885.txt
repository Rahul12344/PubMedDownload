BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the
most economically devastating diseases affecting the swine industry globally.
Evaluation of antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers is the most
effective method for vaccine evaluation. In this study, the B cell line epitopes 
of PRRSV M protein were predicted, and two peptide ELISA assays were established 
(M-A110-129 ELISA, M-A148-174 ELISA) to detect antibodies against PRRSV M
protein. Field serum samples collected from pig farms were used to validate the
peptide ELISA and compare it with an indirect immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of M-A110-129 ELISA and M-A148-174 ELISA
were (111/125) 88.80%, (69/70) 98.57% and (122/125) 97.60%, (70/70) 100%,
relative to indirect immunofluorescence assay. This peptide ELISA could detect
antibodies against different genotypes of PRRSV including type 1 PRRSV, classical
PRRSV, HP-PRRSV, and NADC30 like PRRSV, but not antibodies against other common
swine viruses. The results of ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve
(AUC) of the M-A110-129 ELISA and M-A148-174 ELISA were 0.967 and 0.996,
respectively. Compared the concordance of results using two peptide ELISA assays,
the IDEXX PRRSV X3 Ab ELISA and a virus neutralization test, were assessed using 
a series of 147 sera from pigs vaccinated with the NADC30-like PRRSV inactivated 
vaccine. The M-A148-174 ELISA had the best consistency, with a Cohen's kappa
coefficient of 0.8772. The concordance rates of the Hipra PRRSV ELISA kit,
M-A110-129 ELISA and M-A148-174 ELISA in the field seropositive detection results
were 91.08, 86.32 and 95.35%, relative to indirect immunofluorescence assay.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, compared with M-A110-129 ELISA, the PRRSV M-A148-174
ELISA is of value for detecting antibodies against PRRSV and the evaluation of
the NADC30-like PRRSV inactivated vaccine, but the advantage is insufficient in
serological early diagnosis.
