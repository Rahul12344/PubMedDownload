mRNA vaccines have amassed a strong interest from scientists and nonscientists
alike for their potential in treating cancer and curbing the spread of infectious
diseases. Their success has been bolstered by the COVID-19 pandemic as mRNA
vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus showed unrivaled efficiency and success. The
strategy relies on the delivery of an RNA transcript that carries the sequence of
an antigenic molecule into the body's cells where the antigen is manufactured.
The lack of use of infectious pathogens and the fact that they are made of
nucleic acids render these vaccines a favorable alternative to other vaccination 
modalities. However, mRNA vaccination still suffers from a great deal of hurdles 
starting from their safety, cellular delivery, uptake and response to their
manufacturing, logistics and storage. In this review, we examine the premise of
RNA vaccination starting from their conceptualization to their clinical
applications. We also thoroughly discuss the advances in the field of RNA
vaccination for infectious diseases. Finally, we discuss the challenges impeding 
their progress and shed light on potential areas of research in the field.
