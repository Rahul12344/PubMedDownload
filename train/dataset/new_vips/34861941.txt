Viral proteases are diverse in structure, oligomeric state, catalytic mechanism, 
and substrate specificity. This chapter focuses on proteases from viruses that
are relevant to human health: human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 (HIV-1),
hepatitis C (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), flaviviruses,
enteroviruses, and coronaviruses. The proteases of HIV-1 and HCV have been
successfully targeted for therapeutics, with picomolar FDA-approved drugs
currently used in the clinic. The proteases of HTLV-1 and the other virus
families remain emerging therapeutic targets at different stages of the drug
development process. This chapter provides an overview of the current knowledge
on viral protease structure, mechanism, substrate recognition, and inhibition.
Particular focus is placed on recent advances in understanding the molecular
basis of diverse substrate recognition and resistance, which is essential toward 
designing novel protease inhibitors as antivirals.
