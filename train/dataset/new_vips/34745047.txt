As one of the top 10 plant viruses, the severity of losses to crop productivity
caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has resulted in an urgent need to 
develop a more sensitive and rapid method of detection. In this study, we
developed a CRISPR/Cas13a-based detection system to diagnose TSWV in tomato and
western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). The detection system relies
on recombinase polymerase amplification and Cas13a-mediated collateral cleavage
activity. Positive results can be distinguished after 20 min by a significantly
enhanced fluorescence signal. We tested the sensitivity of CRISPR/Cas13a-based
detection system and found that the detection system that we developed has limits
of detection that reaches 2.26 × 102 copies/μl and a 10-fold increase compared
with the sensitivity of using RT-PCR to detect the virus. Furthermore, the
CRISPR/Cas13a-based detection system has a high selectivity for the TSWV without 
interference from other viruses. The CRISPR/Cas13a-based detection system was
utilized to detect the TSWV in samples of tomato leaves and the transmission
vector F. occidentalis that were fully consistent with the results when RT-PCR
was used to detect the virus.
