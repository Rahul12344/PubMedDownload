PURPOSE: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is caused by Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus ((KSHV),
also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)). KS, which develops most frequently
among people with HIV, is generally treated with chemotherapy, but these drugs
have acute and cumulative toxicities. We previously described initial results of 
a trial of pomalidomide, an oral immunomodulatory derivative of thalidomide, in
patients with KS. Here, we present results on the full cohort and survival
outcomes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Participants with KS with or without HIV were treated with
pomalidomide 5mg once daily for 21 days per 28-day cycle with aspirin 81mg daily 
for thromboprophylaxis. Participants with HIV received antiretroviral therapy.
Response was defined by modified version of the AIDS Clinical Trial Group KS
criteria. We evaluated tumor responses (including participants who had a second
course), adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), and long-term outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants were enrolled. Eighteen (64%) were
HIV-positive, 21 (75%) had advanced (T1) disease. Overall response rate was 71%: 
95% confidence interval (CI) 51-87%. Twelve of 18 HIV-positive (67%; 95% CI:
41-87%) and 8 of 10 HIV-negative participants (80%; 95% CI: 44-97%) had a
response. Two of 4 participants who received a second course of pomalidomide had 
a partial response. The median PFS was 10.2 months (95% CI: 7.6-15.7 months).
Grade 3 neutropenia was noted among 50% of participants. In the follow-up period,
3 participants with HIV had other KSHV-associated diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Pomalidomide is a safe and active chemotherapy-sparing agent for the
treatment of KS among individuals with or without HIV.
