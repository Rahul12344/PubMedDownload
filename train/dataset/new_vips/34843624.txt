ISAV is the causative agent of the infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), a disease
listed by the OIE that has caused important economic losses to the Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar) industry. ISAV variants are identified as pathogenic or
non-pathogenic based on the presence or absence of a deletion in the highly
polymorphic region (HPR) of segment 6 (S6). HPRΔ variants (pathogenic) are the
only forms of the virus known to grow in cell culture. This is the first report
of a HPR0 variant isolated in cell culture. The isolate is, however, atypical as 
it shows a marker of virulent variants on another segment (S5), which has never
been reported for any other HPR0 variants. The significance of this finding
remains unclear until more in-depth work is carried out but does challenge
current knowledge.
