BackgroundRobust data on SARS-CoV-2 population seroprevalence supplement
surveillance data in providing evidence for public health action.AimTo conduct a 
SARS-CoV-2 population-based seroprevalence survey in Ireland.MethodsUsing a
cross-sectional study design, we selected population samples from individuals
aged 12-69 years in counties Dublin and Sligo using the Health Service Executive 
Primary Care Reimbursement Service database as a sampling frame. Samples were
selected with probability proportional to the general population age-sex
distribution, and by simple random sampling within age-sex strata. Antibodies to 
SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and
confirmed using the Wantai Assay. We estimated the population SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence weighted for age, sex and geographic area.ResultsParticipation
rates were 30% (913/3,043) and 44% (820/1,863) in Dublin and Sligo. Thirty-three 
specimens had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (1.9%). We estimated weighted
seroprevalences of 3.12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.05-4.53) and 0.58% (95%
CI: 0.18-1.38) for Dublin and Sligo, and 1.69% (95% CI: 1.13-2.41) nationally.
This equates to an estimated 59,482 (95% CI: 39,772-85,176) people aged 12-69
years nationally having had infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3.0 (95% CI: 2.0-4.3)
times higher than confirmed notifications. Ten participants reported a previous
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 -infection; eight of these were
antibody-positive. Twenty-five antibody-positive participants had not reported
previous laboratory-confirmed infection.ConclusionThe majority of people in
Ireland are unlikely to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by June-July 2020.
Non-pharmaceutical public health measures remained key pending widespread
availability of vaccination, and effective treatments.
