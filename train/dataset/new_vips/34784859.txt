The presence of hypertension among the population with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) has become a new threat to the health and well-being of people living
with this disease, in particular, among those who received antiretroviral
therapy. The estimated prevalence of high blood pressure in HIV-infected patients
is significantly higher than the rate observed in HIV-uninfected subjects. The
approach to the HIV-positive patient requires the assessment of individual
cardiovascular risk and its consideration when designing the individualized
target. On the other hand, the numerous pharmacological interactions of
antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are essential elements to take into account. Serum
levels of any kind of antihypertensive drugs may be influenced by the
coadministration of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor, or other antiretroviral. Similarly, plasma concentrations of
antiretroviral drugs can be increased by the concomitant use of calcium channel
blockers or diuretics. In this regard, the treatment of high blood pressure in
HIV patients should be preferentially based on ACE inhibitors or
thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics or their combination.
