Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the predominant cause of herpes simplex
encephalitis (HSE), a condition characterized by acute inflammation and viral
replication in the brain. Host genetics contribute to HSE onset, including
monogenic defects in type I interferon signaling in cases of childhood HSE. Mouse
models suggest a further contribution of immune cell-mediated inflammation to HSE
pathogenesis. We have previously described a truncating mutation in the c-Rel
transcription factor (RelC307X) that drives lethal HSE in 60% of HSV-1-infected
RelC307X mice. In this study, we combined dual host-virus RNA sequencing with
flow cytometry to explore cell populations and mechanisms involved in
RelC307X-driven HSE. At day 5 postinfection, prior to HSE clinical symptom onset,
elevated HSV-1 transcription was detected together with augmented host
interferon-stimulated and inflammatory gene expression in the brainstems of
high-responding RelC307X mice, predictive of HSE development. This early
induction of host gene expression preceded pathological infiltration of myeloid
and T cells in RelC307X mice at HSE onset by day 7. Thus, we establish c-Rel as
an early regulator of viral and host responses during mouse HSE. These data
further highlight the importance of achieving a balanced immune response and
avoiding excess interferon-driven inflammation to promote HSE resistance.
