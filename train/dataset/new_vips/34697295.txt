The lung is the prophylaxis target against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and neutralizing
antibodies are a leading class of biological products against various infectious 
viral pathogen. In this study, we develop a safe and cost-effective platform to
express neutralizing antibody in the lung with replicating mRNA basing on
alphavirus replicon particle (VRP) delivery system, to prevent SARS-CoV-2
infections. First, a modified VEEV replicon with two subgenomic (sg) promoters
was engineered to translate the light and heavy chains of antibody
simultaneously, for expression and assembly of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody CB6. Second, the feasibility and protective efficacy of replicating mRNA
against SARS-CoV-2 infection were demonstrated through both in vitro and in vivo 
assays. The lung target delivery with the help of VRP system resulted in
efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection with reducing viral titer and less tissue 
damage in the lung of mice. Overall, our data suggests that expressing
neutralizing antibodies in the lungs with the help of self-replicating mRNA could
potentially be a promising prophylaxis approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
