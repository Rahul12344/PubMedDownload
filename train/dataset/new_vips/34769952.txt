Non-adherence to COVID-19 guidelines may be attributable to low levels of worry. 
This study assessed whether endorsing COVID-19-stigmatizing restrictions,
COVID-19 knowledge, and preferred news source were associated with being 'very
worried' versus 'not at all' or 'somewhat' worried about contracting COVID-19.
Survey data were collected in July-August 2020 from N = 547 New York State (NYS) 
and N = 504 national Amazon MTurk workers. Respondents who endorsed COVID-19
stigmatizing restrictions (NYS OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.31, 2.92; national OR 1.80; 95% 
CI 1.06, 3.08) and consumed commercial news (NYS OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.21, 2.96;
national OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.24, 3.00) were more likely to be very worried.
National respondents who consumed The New York Times (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.00, 2.29)
were more likely to be very worried, while those with little knowledge (OR 0.24; 
95% CI 0.13, 0.43) were less likely to be very worried. NYS (OR 2.66; 95% CI
1.77, 4.00) and national (OR 3.17; 95% CI 1.95, 5.16) respondents with probable
depression were also more likely to be very worried. These characteristics can
help identify those requiring intervention to maximize perceived threat to
COVID-19 and encourage uptake of protective behaviors while protecting
psychological wellbeing.
