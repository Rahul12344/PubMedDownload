Healthcare personnel (HCP) with unprotected exposures to aerosol-generating
procedures (AGPs) on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at
risk of infection with severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
A retrospective review at an academic medical center demonstrated an infection
rate of <1% among HCP involved in AGPs without a respirator and/or eye
protection.
