The patient's breathing and air conditioning system in the enclosed space are the
main factors that cause indoor cross-infection. However, the research on the
influence and the control mechanism of different air conditioning systems on the 
transmission path of virus aerosol particles exhaled by patients is still
limited. To evaluate the effects of different air conditioning systems on the
spread of human exhaled pollutants, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used
to study the movement and diffusion of exhaled air from two rows of 12 sitting
adults in a hospital's closed transfusion room. In this paper, three different
air conditioning systems are considered: Ceil-supply and Down-return
(Ceil-to-Down), Up-supply and Down-return (Up-to-Down), Down-supply and Up-return
(Down-to-Up). The distribution of exhaled air velocity, temperature, and virus
particle concentration were studied, and it is found that the horizontal
diffusion distance of exhaled pollutants is about 0.75 -1.1 m. When up to down
systems are used, the air conditioning system shall be closed in time in case of 
respiratory infectious diseases, so as to avoid cross-infection in the enclosed
space. A relatively clean air area with a height of about 1.1 m will be formed,
which can inhibit the transmission of the virus to a certain extent when using
the down-to-up system. But for those who are exposed to the enclosed space for a 
long time, the down-to-up system is not the most suitable air conditioning
system.
