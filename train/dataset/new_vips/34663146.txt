OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were implemented,
however, data indicates road crash rates have not decreased proportionately to
the decline in traffic density. This study explored how speeding and phone use
while driving (road behaviors associated with a high crash risk) changed as a
result of COVID-19 restrictions in Queensland.
METHODS: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in Queensland, Australia to
examine self-reported changes in speeding and phone use while driving before,
during and after the easing of restrictions (while also considering exposure to
the road and driving location). Study 1 (n = 351) was conducted between 12 May
and 12 June 2020, when the majority of COVID-19 restrictions were enforced. Study
2 (n = 427) was conducted between 24 June and 12 August 2020, when restrictions
were easing.
RESULTS: The findings indicated, overall, self-reported speeding and phone use
significantly decreased during restrictions (likely due to reduced travel), but
not for those who continued to drive regularly. There was an additional,
significant self-reported decrease in phone use while driving after restrictions 
were eased when compared to engagement during restrictions, which may (in part)
be due to the simultaneous introduction of roadside mobile phone detection
cameras.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of visible deterrence and
provide a glimpse of possible consequences if there is a more sustained reduction
in policing presence on roads.
