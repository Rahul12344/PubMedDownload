Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still rampant,
vaccination is being promoted worldwide. However, the safety of various COVID-19 
vaccines remains poorly understood. We herein report the case of a 37-year-old
woman who experienced thrombocytopenia following BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19
vaccination. The patient presented with purpura on the extremities 10 days after 
the first vaccination. She had marked thrombocytopenia and no thrombosis.
Thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously. Given the possibility of occurrence of
post-vaccination thrombocytopenia, vaccinated persons should be instructed to
consult a medical institution if they experience bleeding symptoms.
