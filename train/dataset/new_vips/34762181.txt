It has been claimed that the global pandemic is a 'great equaliser' that creates 
a sense of cohesion, however, this is problematic since COVID-19 has revealed the
stark divisions in our societies. For instance, in the UK COVID-19 has hit
northern cities particularly hard. Therefore, by focusing on the north of
England, and Bradford especially, this paper offers suggestions which may help us
see clearly through COVID-19, creating a future that is more equitable.
