Aim: In the present study, the relationship between D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio
(DFR) and in-hospital outcomes was evaluated in patients with COVID-19 and a
diagnosis of heart failure (HF). Materials & methods: In-hospital outcomes were
compared in patients with high and low DFR values. Results: With regard to
in-hospital outcomes, patients in the third tertile of DFR had a higher rate of
mechanical ventilation, cardiogenic shock and death (p < 0.001). The length of
ICU stay was longer in the third tertile group (p < 0.001). When evaluated
together with infection markers, DFR was found to be an independent
predictor of outcomes. Conclusion: DFR can be used as a prognostic marker in
patients with COVID-19 with a diagnosis of HF, and perhaps more valuable than
other infection markers.
