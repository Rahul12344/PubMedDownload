As we respond to viral epidemics and accelerate the discovery of new viruses,
sifting through vast volumes of structural virology data could rapidly become an 
impossible task. virusMED is a curated atlas of metal/drug-binding and
immunological hotspots in viral protein structures that provides a navigation
guide for structure-function analysis and the development of antiviral
strategies.
