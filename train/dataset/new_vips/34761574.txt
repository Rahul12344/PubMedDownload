Coronavirus-related Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002/2003,
Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-Cov) in 2012/2013, and especially the
current 2019/2020 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested the
national health systems' endurance worldwide. In order to fight this emergency
situation, a variety of pharmaceutical companies focused on the design and
development of efficient vaccines that are considered necessary for providing a
level of normalization in totally affected human social-economical activity
worldwide. COVID-19 led to an increased uncertainty in the field of oncological
patients' management disrupting the normal conditions of therapeutic and
monitoring procedures. In the current article, we explored the impact of
SARS-CoV-2 infection on oral carcinoma patients. We observed COVD-19 pandemic
negatively affects the normality regarding early diagnosis and optimal management
(surgical operation, post-operational follow up/monitoring) in HNSCC/OSCC
patients. Understanding the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in the progression of
malignancies is the first critical step for targeting the virus by efficient
monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.
