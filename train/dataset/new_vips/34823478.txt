BACKGROUND: The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran were reported in Qom
city. Subsequently, the neighboring provinces and gradually all 31 provinces of
Iran were involved. This study aimed to investigate the case fatility rate, basic
reproductive number in different period of epidemic, projection of daily and
cumulative incidence cases and also spatiotemporal mapping of SARS-CoV-2 in
Alborz province, Iran.
METHODS: A confirmed case of COVID-19 infection was defined as a case with a
positive result of viral nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens. Serial
interval (SI) was fitted by gamma distribution and considered the
likelihood-based R0 using a branching process with Poisson likelihood. Seven days
average of cases, deaths, doubling times and CFRs used to draw smooth charts.
kernel density tool in Arc GIS (Esri) software has been employed to compute hot
spot area of the study site.
RESULTS: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.88 (95%, CI: 2.57-3.23) in the 
early 14 days of epidemic. The case fatility rate for Alborz province (Iran) on
March 10, was 8.33% (95%, CI:6.3-11), and by April 20, it had an increasing trend
and reached 12.9% (95%,CI:11.5-14.4). The doubling time has been increasing from 
about two days and then reached about 97 days on April 20, 2020, which shows the 
slowdown in the spread rate of the disease. Also, from March 26 to April 2, 2020 
the whole Geographical area of Karj city was almost affected by SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS: The R0 of COVID-19 in Alborz province was substantially high at the 
beginning of the epidemic, but with preventive measures and public education and 
GIS based monitoring of the cases,it has been reduced to 1.19 within two months. 
This reduction highpoints the attainment of preventive measures in place, however
we must be ready for any second epidemic waves during the next months.
