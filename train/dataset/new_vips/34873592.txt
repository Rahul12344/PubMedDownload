Background: Understanding the duration of protection and risk of reinfection
after natural infection is crucial to planning COVID-19 vaccination for at-risk
groups, including care home residents, particularly with the emergence of more
transmissible variants. We report on the duration, neutralising activity, and
protection against the alpha variant of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in care
home residents and staff infected more than 6 months previously.
Methods: We did this prospective observational cohort surveillance in 13 care
homes in Greater London, England. All staff and residents were included. Staff
and residents had regular nose and throat screening for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR
according to national guidelines, with ad hoc testing of symptomatic individuals.
From January, 2021, antigen lateral flow devices were also used, but positive
tests still required RT-PCR confirmation. Staff members took the swab samples for
themselves and the residents. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive 
primary infection or reinfection in previously infected individuals, as
determined by previous serological testing and screening or diagnostic RT-PCR
results. Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to
estimate protective effectiveness of previous exposure. SARS-CoV-2 spike,
nucleoprotein, and neutralising antibodies were assessed at multiple timepoints
as part of the longitudinal follow-up.
Findings: Between April 10 and Aug 3, 2020, we recruited and tested 1625
individuals (933 staff and 692 residents). 248 participants were lost to
follow-up (123 staff and 125 residents) and 1377 participants were included in
the follow-up period to Jan 31, 2021 (810 staff and 567 residents). There were 23
reinfections (ten confirmed, eight probable, five possible) in 656 previously
infected individuals (366 staff and 290 residents), compared with 165 primary
infections in 721 susceptible individuals (444 staff and 277 residents). Those
with confirmed reinfections had no or low neutralising antibody concentration
before reinfection, with boosting of titres after reinfection. Kinetics of
binding and neutralising antibodies were similar in older residents and younger
staff.
Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 reinfections were rare in older residents and younger 
staff. Protection from SARS-CoV-2 was sustained for longer than 9 months,
including against the alpha variant. Reinfection was associated with no or low
neutralising antibody before reinfection, but significant boosting occurred on
reinfection.
