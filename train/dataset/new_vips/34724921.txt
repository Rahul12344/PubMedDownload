BACKGROUND: College students are leading an evolution of device use both in the
type of device and the frequency of use. They have transitioned from desktop
stations to laptops, tablets, and especially smartphones and use them throughout 
the day and into the night.
METHODS: Using a 35-min online survey, we sought to understand how technology
daily usage patterns, device types, and postures affect pain and discomfort to
understand how knowledge of that pain might help students avoid it. Data were
analyzed from 515 students (69.5% male) who completed an internet-delivered
survey (81.3% response rate).
RESULTS: Participants ranked smartphones as their most frequently used technology
(64.0%), followed by laptops and tablets (both 53.2%), and desktop computers
(46.4%). Time spent using smartphones averaged over 4.4 h per day. When using
their devices, students were more likely to adopt non-traditional workplace
postures as they used these devices primarily on the couch or at a chair with no 
desk.
CONCLUSION: Recent trends in wireless academic access points along with the
portability of small handheld devices, have made smartphones the most common link
to educational materials despite having the least favorable control and display
scenario from an ergonomic perspective. Further, the potential impact of
transitions in work environments due to COVID-19 may further exacerbate ergonomic
issues among millions highlighting the need for such work to be carried out.
