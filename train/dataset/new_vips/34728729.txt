Earlier in 2020, seven Italian regions, which cover 62% of the Italian
population, set up the Mimico-19 network to monitor the side effects of the
restrictive measures against Covid-19 on volumes and quality of care. To this
aim, we retrospectively analysed hospital discharges data, computing twelve
indicators of volume and performance in three clinical areas: cardiology,
oncology, and orthopaedics. Weekly indicators for the period January-July 2020
were compared with the corresponding average for 2018-2019; comparisons were
performed within 3 sub-periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. The
weekly trend of hospitalisations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI) showed a 40% reduction, but the proportion of STEMI patients with a
primary PTCA did not significantly change from previous years. Malignant
neoplasms surgery volumes differed substantially by site, with a limited
reduction for lung cancer (< 20%) and greater declines (30-40%) for breast and
prostate cancers. The percentage of timely surgery for femoral neck in the
elderly remained constantly higher than the previous 2 years whereas hip and knee
replacements fell dramatically. Hospitalisations have generally decreased, but
the capacity of a timely and effective response in time-dependent pathways of
care was not jeopardized throughout the period. General trends did not show
important differences across regions, regardless of the different burden of
Covid-19. Preventive and primary care services should adopt a pro-active
approach, moving towards the identification of at-risk conditions that were
neglected during the pandemic and timely addressing patients to the secondary
care system.
