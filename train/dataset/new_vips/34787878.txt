OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the association between platelet
indices and disease severity, and outcomes of the patients with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a secondary hospital.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 722 hospitalized patients who had positive rRT-PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 and/or typical findings of COVID-19 at chest computed tomography (CT) 
were enrolled in this study. Initial platelet count (PLT) and indices, including 
mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), plateletcrit
(PCT), MPV/PCT, MPV/PLT, PDW/PLT, PDW/PCT on admission and the third day of
hospitalization, and their relationship with disease severity and outcomes were
evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 57.2±15.6 years (range: 16-94) and
male/female ratio was 1.22. 81.9% of the patients had moderate and 11.8% had
severe disease. 1.8% of the patients had thrombocytopenia at admission. The
patients transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) had significantly lower
baseline lymphocyte counts, PLT, PCT, and 3rd day lymphocyte counts when compared
with the patients in wards. ICU patients also had higher baseline CRP, LDH,
ferritin, MPV/PCT, MPV/PLT, PDW/PLT, PDW/PCT ratios, and 3rd day PDW, CRP, LDH,
and ferritin levels than the patients in wards. Mortality was associated with
lower baseline lymphocyte counts, PLT, PCT, 3rd day lymphocyte counts and PCT.
Higher baseline CRP, LDH, ferritin, MPV/PCT, PDW/PLT, PDW/PCT and 3rd day CRP,
LDH, ferritin, procalcitonin, PDW, MPV/PCT, PDW/PLT, and PDW/PCT ratios were also
associated with poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Platelet count and ratios were significantly associated with
mortality in patients with COVID-19.
