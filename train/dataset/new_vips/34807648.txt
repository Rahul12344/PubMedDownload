The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique biological, psychological, and social
threats to health care providers. The failure of local macrosystems placed
providers at elevated risk of psychological and physical harm. To reduce the
immediate risk of trauma to our local physician workforce, our team initiated a
program of proactive psychological first aid in which physicians were regularly
contacted by behavioral health colleagues to assess safety conditions and
physician's well-being. When threats to the physician's safety were identified,
these concerns were escalated to leadership and addressed when possible. When
threats to well-being were identified, behavioral health team members provided
supportive listening, and, if indicated, provided referral information for
appropriate treatment resources. This paper reviews the rationale for this
program, addresses ethical concerns, and proposes future directions for
responding to threats to safety during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
