BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single stranded non enveloped DNA virus.
Various studies have found a high prevalence of TTV in different populations and 
in different human samples including blood and stool.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of TTV in 
adult patients with acute gastroenteritis in stool samples by semi-nested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
METHODS: This study was a retrospective, cross-sectional study carried out on 100
preserved stool samples from adult patients with simple community acquired
diarrhea without dehydration. Stool samples were subjected to antigen detection
of rotavirus and norovirus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Detection of TTV was performed by the use of semi- nested PCR.
RESULTS: The detected viruses were TTV by semi-nested PCR in 83% of the patients,
followed by both norovirus and rotavirus in 20% of patients each. TTV was present
without any other studied virus in 52% of the samples, the norovirus antigen was 
detected as a single virus in 2%, and rotavirus was detected as a single virus in
3%. No viruses were detected in 11% of the stool samples. Norovirus was
associated with TTV in 17 isolates and as a sole virus in three samples (p =
0.5). Rotavirus was associated with TTV in 17 isolates and alone in three.
CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present study show a high prevalence of TTV in stool
samples from adults with acute gastroenteritis. The presence of rotavirus and
norovirus was also a common finding in these patients. There were no detected
effects on the clinical features of gastroenteritis associated with the presence 
of TTV in acute gastroenteritis.
