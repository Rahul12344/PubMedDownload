Polyphenols are active substances against various types of viral infections.
Researchers have characterized methods of how to isolate polyphenols without
losing their potential to formulate pharmaceutical products. Researchers have
also described mechanisms against common viral infections (i.e., influenza,
herpes, hepatitis, rotavirus, coronavirus). Particular compounds have been
discussed together with the plants in the biomass in which they occur. Quercetin,
gallic acid and epigallocatechin are exemplary compounds that inhibit the growth 
cycle of viruses. Special attention has been paid to identify plants and
polyphenols that can be efficient against coronavirus infections. It has been
proven that polyphenols present in the diet and in pharmaceuticals protect us
from viral infections and, in case of infection, support the healing process by
various mechanisms, i.e., they block the entry into the host cells, inhibit the
multiplication of the virus, seal blood vessels and protect against
superinfection.
