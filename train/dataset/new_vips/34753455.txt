BACKGROUND: Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a cyclic sequence of physical and
behavioral symptoms that arise in the second half of the menstrual cycle. The
extreme type of PMS is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). The current study 
aims at examining 1) the effects of childhood maltreatment and current life's
stressful events on PMDD, and 2) the mediating role of depression in these
associations among Lebanese university female students.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between February and March 2021
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lebanese students were recruited using a snowball
technique from all national universities in Lebanon via an auto-administrated
online survey. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the
structural relationship between childhood maltreatment and life's stressful
events, depression and PMDD.
RESULTS: Higher life's stressful events (Beta = 0.18; p < 0.001), physical
(Beta = 0.19; p < 0.001), sexual (Beta = 0.18; p < 0.001) and psychological
(Beta = 0.33; p < 0.001) abuse were significantly associated with higher
depression. Moreover, higher sexual (Beta = 0.11; p = 0.021) and psychological
(Beta = 0.11; p = 0.040) abuse and higher depression (Beta = 0.37; p < 0.001)
were significantly associated with higher PMDD. The indirect relationships
between psychological abuse/sexual abuse, depression and PMDD showed that
depression mediated the association between both psychological (Beta = 0.22;
p = 0.001) and sexual (Beta = 0.38; p = 0.004) abuse and PMDD.
CONCLUSION: This work presents a unique analysis using the structural equation
model that enlightens the effect of childhood maltreatment, particularly sexual
and psychological abuse on PMMD symptoms, with depression playing the role of a
mediating factor. It would be interesting to test, in future studies, whether
there are other mediating factors besides depression that could be indirect
indicators of PMDD.
