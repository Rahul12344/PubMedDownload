COVID-19 presentations range from mild to moderate through severe disease but
also manifest with persistent illness or viral recrudescence. We hypothesized
that the spectrum of COVID-19 disease manifestations was a consequence of
SARS-CoV-2-mediated delay in the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)
response, including dampened type I interferon signaling, thereby shifting the
balance of the immune response to be dominated by damage-associated molecular
pattern (DAMP) signaling. To test the hypothesis, we constructed a parsimonious
mechanistic mathematical model. After calibration of the model for initial viral 
load and then by varying a few key parameters, we show that the core model
generates four distinct viral load, immune response and associated disease
trajectories termed "patient archetypes", whose temporal dynamics are reflected
in clinical data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The model also accounts for
responses to corticosteroid therapy and predicts that vaccine-induced
neutralizing antibodies and cellular memory will be protective, including from
severe COVID-19 disease. This generalizable modeling framework could be used to
analyze protective and pathogenic immune responses to diverse viral infections.
