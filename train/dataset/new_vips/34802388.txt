PURPOSE: To evaluate the rates of Herpes Simplex Virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2
(HSV-2) in ocular specimens.
METHODS: Retrospective case series of all patients with a positive laboratory
evaluation for ocular HSV performed at the Auckland District Health Board,
Auckland, New Zealand between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2017 were included
in the study.
RESULTS: A total of 423 specimens were positive for HSV-1 (99.3%, n = 419) or
HSV-2 (0.7%; n = 4). The majority of positive tests were identified through DNA
amplification (n = 352; 83%) testing while the remainder were obtained by viral
culture (n = 71; 17%). Ocular disease caused by HSV-2 in this study included
acute retinal necrosis (n = 2), keratitis (n = 1), and blepharitis (n = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: HSV type 2 is a rare cause of ocular and peri-ocular infection but
may cause severe, vision threatening disease.
