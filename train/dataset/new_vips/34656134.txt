BACKGROUND: A 73-year-old male patient who had a history of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection for over 20 years was diagnosed with
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU),
where he remained for 25 days, due to a severe condition. Intubation,
hemodialysis, and tracheostomy were necessary to maintain homeostasis. In
addition to regular treatment with etravirine, dolutegravir, darunavir, and
ritonavir for highly active antiretroviral therapy, the patient received
tocilizumab, which showed a great recovery in the patient's condition.
CONCLUSION: The patient had several risk factors, such as male gender, age  > 
70 years, and arterial hypertension. The use of tocilizumab was of great
importance in the patient's recovery since the drug increased his immune
response, which is deficient, due to HIV infection.
