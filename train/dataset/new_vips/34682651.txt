Confronted with a global pandemic, public healthcare systems are under pressure, 
making access to healthcare services difficult for patients. This provides
fertile ground for using illegal practices such as informal payments to gain
access. This paper aims to evaluate the use of informal payments by patients
during the COVID-19 pandemic and the institutions that affect the prevalence of
this practice. Various measurements of formal and informal institutions are here 
investigated, namely the acceptability of corruption, the level of trust,
transparency, and performance of the healthcare system. To do so, a logistic
regression of 10,859 interviews with patients conducted across 11 Central and
Eastern Europe countries in October-December 2020 is employed. The finding is
that there are large disparities between countries in the prevalence of informal 
payments, and that the practice is more likely to occur where there are poorer
formal and informal institutions, namely higher acceptability of corruption,
lower trust in authorities, lower perceived transparency in handling the COVID-19
pandemic, difficult access to, and poor quality of, healthcare services, and
higher mortality rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that 
policy measures for tackling informal payments need to address the current state 
of the institutional environment.
