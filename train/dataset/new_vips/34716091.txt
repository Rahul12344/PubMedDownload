There is an increasing demand for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies to confer
passive immunity against viral diseases. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the
most common cause of bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract infections, and
hospitalization in infants. Currently, there is no RSV vaccine but a humanized
mAb available for high risk infants. MK-1654 is a fully human mAb with YTE
mutation in the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region to extend the half-life in
circulation. It binds to a highly conserved epitope of RSV Fusion protein with
high affinity and neutralizes RSV infection. A functional cell-based assay is a
regulatory requirement for clinical development, commercial release, and
stability testing of MK-1654. In this study, we have evaluated three RSV
neutralization assays to test the potency of MK-1654, including an imaging-based 
virus reduction neutralization test (VRNT) and two reporter virus-based assays
(RSV-GFP and RSV-NLucP). All three methods showed good dose response curves of
MK-1654 with similar EC50 values. RSV-NLucP method was chosen for further
development because it is simple and can be easily adapted to quality control
testing laboratories. After optimization, the RSV-NLucP assay was pre-qualified
with good linearity, relative accuracy, intermediate precision, and specificity, 
therefore suitable for a cell-based potency assay.
