Objectives: To evaluate the performance of metagenomic next generation sequencing
(mNGS) using adequate criteria for the detection of pathogens in lower
respiratory tract (LRT) samples with a paired comparison to conventional
microbiology tests (CMT). Methods: One hundred sixty-seven patients were reviewed
from four different intensive care units (ICUs) in mainland China during 2018
with both mNGS and CMT results of LRT samples available. The reads per million
ratio (RPMsample/RPMnon-template-control ratio) and standardized strictly mapped 
reads number (SDSMRN) were the two criteria chosen for identifying positive
pathogens reported from mNGS. A McNemar test was used for a paired comparison
analysis between mNGS and CMT. Results: One hundred forty-nine cases were counted
into the final analysis. The RPMsample/RPMNTC ratio criterion performed better
with a higher accuracy for bacteria, fungi, and virus than SDSMRN criterion
[bacteria (RPMsample/RPMNTC ratio vs. SDSMRN), 65.1 vs. 55.7%; fungi, 75.8 vs.
71.1%; DNA virus, 86.3 vs. 74.5%; RNA virus, 90.9 vs. 81.8%]. The mNGS was also
superior in bacteria detection only if an SDSMRN ≥3 was used as a positive
criterion with a paired comparison to culture [SDSMRN positive, 92/149 (61.7%);
culture positive, 54/149 (36.2%); p < 0.001]; however, it was outperformed with
significantly more fungi and DNA virus identification when choosing both criteria
for positive outliers [fungi (RPMsample/RPMNTC ratio vs. SDSMRN vs. culture),
23.5 vs. 29.5 vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001; DNA virus (RPMsample/RPMNTC ratio vs. SDSMRN
vs. PCR), 14.1 vs. 20.8 vs. 11.8%, p < 0.05]. Conclusions: Metagenomic next
generation sequencing may contribute to revealing the LRT infection etiology in
hospitalized groups of potential fungal infections and in situations with less
access to the multiplex PCR of LRT samples from the laboratory by choosing a wise
criterion like the RPMsample/RPMNTC ratio.
