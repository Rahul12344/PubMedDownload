BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis relies on the performance of nasopharyngeal
swabs. Alternative sample sites have been assessed but the heterogeneity of the
studies have made comparing different sites difficult.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare the performance of four different sampling
sites for SARS-CoV-2 samples with nasopharynx being the benchmark.
STUDY DESIGN: COVID-19 positive patients were recruited prospectively, and
samples were collected and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR from all four
anatomical sites in 43 patients, who provided written informed consent.
RESULTS: All anterior nasal and saliva samples were positive, while two
oropharyngeal samples were negative. There was no significant difference in the
cycle threshold values of nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal samples while saliva 
and oropharynx had higher cycle threshold values.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior nasal swab performs as good as nasopharynx swab with saliva
also finding all the positives but with higher cycle threshold values. Thus, we
can conclude that anterior nasal swabs can be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection
instead of nasopharyngeal swabs if the situation would require so.
