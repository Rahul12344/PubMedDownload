Infectious agents, especially bacteria and viruses, account for a vast number of 
hospitalisations and mortality worldwide. Providing effective and timely
diagnostics for the multiplicity of infectious diseases is challenging.
Conventional diagnostic solutions, although technologically advanced, are highly 
complex and often inaccessible in resource-limited settings. An alternative
strategy involves convenient rapid diagnostics which can be easily administered
at the point-of-care (POC) and at low cost without sacrificing reliability.
Biosensors and other rapid POC diagnostic tools which require biorecognition
elements to precisely identify the causative pathogen are being developed. The
effectiveness of these devices is highly dependent on their biorecognition
capabilities. Naturally occurring biorecognition elements include antibodies,
bacteriophages and enzymes. Recently, modified molecules such as DNAzymes,
peptide nucleic acids and molecules which suffer a selective screening like
aptamers and peptides are gaining interest for their biorecognition capabilities 
and other advantages over purely natural ones, such as robustness and lower
production costs. Antimicrobials with a broad-spectrum activity against
pathogens, such as antibiotics, are also used in dual diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies. Other successful pathogen identification strategies use chemical
ligands, molecularly imprinted polymers and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats-associated nuclease. Herein, the latest developments
regarding biorecognition elements and strategies to use them in the design of new
biosensors for pathogens detection are reviewed.
