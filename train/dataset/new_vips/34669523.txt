The coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute
respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2, has to date resulted in an estimated
global death toll of more than 1.5 million with more than 69 million reported
cases worldwide. It has become increasingly clear that delivery of effective
neurointerventional clinical care means maintaining an able and safe workforce in
a rapidly changing environment. Staff and physician protection has become
increasingly topical and relevant within the angiography suite both in peripheral
and cardiac intervention and in neurointervention. The following review outlines 
the types of personal protective equipment relevant to neurointerventional care, 
summarises society guidelines and makes recommendations for the provision of safe
care to both staff and patients.
