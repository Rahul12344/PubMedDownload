Bacterial nanocompartments, also known as encapsulins, are an emerging class of
protein-based 'organelles' found in bacteria and archaea. Encapsulins are
virus-like icosahedral particles comprising a ~ 25-50 nm shell surrounding a
specific cargo enzyme. Compartmentalization is thought to create a unique
chemical environment to facilitate catalysis and isolate toxic intermediates.
Many questions regarding nanocompartment structure-function remain unanswered,
including how shell symmetry dictates cargo loading and to what extent the shell 
facilitates enzymatic activity. Here, we explore these questions using the model 
Thermotoga maritima nanocompartment known to encapsulate a redox-active
ferritin-like protein. Biochemical analysis revealed the encapsulin shell to
possess a flavin binding site located at the interface between capsomere
subunits, suggesting the shell may play a direct and active role in the function 
of the encapsulated cargo. Furthermore, we used cryo-EM to show that cargo
proteins use a form of symmetry-matching to facilitate encapsulation and define
stoichiometry. In the case of the Thermotoga maritima encapsulin, the decameric
cargo protein with fivefold symmetry preferentially binds to the pentameric-axis 
of the icosahedral shell. Taken together, these observations suggest the shell is
not simply a passive barrier-it also plays a significant role in the structure
and function of the cargo enzyme.
