Pathological myocardial hypertrophy is regulated by multiple pathways. However,
its underlying pathogenesis has not been fully explored. The goal of this work
was to elucidate the function of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 4 
(GALNT4) in myocardial hypertrophy and its underlying mechanism of action. We
illustrated that GALNT4 was upregulated in the models of hypertrophy. Two cardiac
hypertrophy models were established through partial transection of the aorta in
GALNT4-knockout (GALNT4-KO) mice and adeno-associated virus 9-GALNT4
(AAV9-GALNT4) mice. The GALNT4-KO mice demonstrated accelerated cardiac
hypertrophy, dysfunction, and fibrosis, whereas the opposite phenotype was
observed in AAV9-GALNT4 mice. Similarly, GALNT4 overexpression mitigated the
degree of phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro whereas GALNT4
knockdown aggravated the hypertrophy. In terms of mechanism, GALNT4 deficiency
increased the phosphorylation and activation of ASK1 and its downstream targets
(JNK and p38), whereas GALNT4 overexpression inhibited activation of the ASK1
pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GALNT4 can directly bind to ASK1
inhibiting its N-terminally mediated dimerization and the subsequent
phosphorylation of ASK1. Finally, an ASK1 inhibitor (iASK1) was able to reverse
the effects of GALNT4 in vitro. In summary, GALNT4 may serve as a new regulatory 
factor and therapeutic target by blocking the activation of the ASK1 signaling
cascade.
