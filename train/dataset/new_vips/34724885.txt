The continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants calls for regular assessment to
identify differences in viral replication, shedding and associated disease. In
this study, we compared African green monkeys infected intranasally with either
the UK B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant or its contemporary D614G progenitor. Both
variants caused mild respiratory disease with no significant differences in
clinical presentation. Significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious
virus were found in upper and lower respiratory tract samples and tissues from
B.1.1.7 infected animals. Interestingly, D614G infected animals showed
significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus in rectal swabs and
gastrointestinal tissues. Our results indicate that B.1.1.7 infection in African 
green monkeys is associated with increased respiratory replication and shedding
but no disease enhancement similar to human B.1.1.7 cases.
