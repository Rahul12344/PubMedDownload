Spatiotemporal control of brain activity by optogenetics has emerged as an
essential tool to study brain function. For silencing brain activity, optogenetic
probes, such as halorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin, inhibit transmitter release
indirectly by hyperpolarizing membrane potentials. However, these probes cause an
undesirable ionic imbalance and rebound spikes. Moreover, they are not applicable
to use in non-excitable glial cells. Here we engineered Opto-vTrap, a
light-inducible and reversible inhibition system to temporarily trap the
transmitter-containing vesicles from exocytotic release. Light activation of
Opto-vTrap caused full vesicle clusterization and complete inhibition of
exocytosis within 1 min, which recovered within 30 min after light off. We found 
a significant reduction in synaptic and gliotransmission upon activation of
Opto-vTrap in acute brain slices. Opto-vTrap significantly inhibited
hippocampus-dependent memory retrieval with full recovery within an hour. We
propose Opto-vTrap as a next-generation optogenetic silencer to control brain
activity and behavior with minimal confounding effects.
