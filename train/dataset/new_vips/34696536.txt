The H1N1 pandemic of 2009-2010, MERS epidemic of 2012, Ebola epidemics of
2013-2016 and 2018-2020, Zika epidemic of 2015-2016, and COVID-19 pandemic of
2019-2021, are recent examples in the long history of epidemics that demonstrate 
the enormous global impact of viral infection. The rapid development of safe and 
effective vaccines and therapeutics has proven vital to reducing morbidity and
mortality from newly emerging viruses. Structural biology methods can be used to 
determine how antibodies elicited during infection or vaccination target viral
proteins and identify viral epitopes that correlate with potent neutralization.
Here we review how structural and molecular biology approaches have contributed
to our understanding of antibody recognition of pathogenic viruses, specifically 
HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Zika. Determining structural correlates of neutralization 
of viruses has guided the design of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and small
molecule inhibitors in response to the global threat of viral epidemics.
