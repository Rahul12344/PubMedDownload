Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and
natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards
outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be
targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine
two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup
hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long
history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the
"context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain
contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of
Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be
targeted. Results from our study (N=664), conducted during the first peak of
COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted
lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this
association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a
context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat,
exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our
findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup 
hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to
scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions
during large-scale crises.
