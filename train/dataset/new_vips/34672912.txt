BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a marked increase in the use of
videoconferencing for social interaction. Many people report discomfort and
disaffection with this modality, which has been labeled "Zoom Fatigue." Common
videoconferencing hardware setups necessitate that if a user looks at the image
of the person with whom they are in videoconference, they will not be looking
directly at the camera and will appear to not be making direct eye contact. This 
study determined the minimum threshold of eccentric gaze in a videoconferencing
setup above which subjects are perceived as not making direct eye contact by the 
majority of untrained observers.
METHODS: Image captures were made of four subjects successively fixating at small
increments eccentric to a video camera, both vertically and horizontally ranging 
from 0.9 degrees to 19 degrees of eccentricity. The images were embedded in
separate Powerpoint files for each subject. Each file was assessed by seven
graders who indicated whether or not they felt the subject was looking directly
at them in each slide.
RESULTS: The threshold for which 75% of the graders could detect that the subject
was not looking at them ranged from only 2.7 degrees for horizontal eccentricity 
to 5.4 degrees for vertical eccentricity.
CONCLUSION: The hardware setups commonly used for videoconferencing result in
persistent eccentric gaze of the participating individuals if they look at the
image of the other participants. In theory, this could be a contributing cause of
Zoom Fatigue.
