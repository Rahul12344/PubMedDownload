The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbours a highly complex ecosystem composed
of a variety of micro- (bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoans) and macro-organisms
(helminths). Although most microbiota research focuses on the variation of single
gut components, the crosstalk between components is still poorly characterized,
especially in hosts living under natural conditions. We investigated the gut
micro-biodiversity (bacteria, fungi and helminths) of 158 individuals of two wild
non-human primates, the Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) and the
yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus). These species have contrasting diets and
lifestyles, but live sympatrically in both human-impacted and pristine forests in
the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. Using non-invasive faecal pellets, helminths 
were identified using standard microscopy while bacteria and fungi were
characterized by sequencing the V1-V3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene for
bacteria and the ITS1-ITS2 fragment for fungi. Our results show that both
diversity and composition of bacteria and fungi are associated with variation in 
helminth presence. Although interactions differed by habitat type, in both
primates we found that Strongyloides was negatively associated and Trichuris was 
positively associated with bacterial and fungal richness. To our knowledge, this 
is one of the few studies demonstrating an interaction between helminth and gut
microbiota communities in wild non-human primates.
