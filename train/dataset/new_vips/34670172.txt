whereas high-intensity exercise may result in the opposite.

Sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19
independently of other factors. There is enough statistics to show that exercise 
prevents severe forms of COVID-19, but current recommendations do not set an
upper limit for exercise intensity. The hypothesis presented in the paper states 
that intense exercise, through blood hypoxia, increases the expression of
transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (tACE2) in the vascular
endothelium, increasing the risk of developing serious forms of disease,
especially in the untrained. On the other hand, moderate-intensity exercise
increases the blood concentration of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) which has a protective role for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may prevent
complications. The importance of this hypothesis consists in the revision of
COVID-19 prophylaxis programs through physical exercises, with the possibility of
administration of antioxidants to speed up the adaptation of vascular endothelial
cells to exertion.
