Eighteen months into the COVID-19 pandemic, and as the world struggles with
global vaccine equity, emerging variants, and the reality that eradication is
years away at soonest, we add to notion of "layered defenses" proposing a
conceptual model for better understanding the differential applicability and
effectiveness of precautions against SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The prevailing
adaptation of Reason's Swiss cheese model conceives of all defensive layers as
equally protective, when in reality some are more effective than others. Adapting
the hierarchy of controls framework from occupational safety provides a better
framework for understanding the relative benefit of different hazard control
strategies to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
