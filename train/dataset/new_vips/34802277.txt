Prolonged school closure has been adopted worldwide to control COVID-19. Indeed, 
UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization figures show that two-thirds
of an academic year was lost on average worldwide due to COVID-19 school
closures. Such pre-emptive implementation was predicated on the premise that
school children are a core group for COVID-19 transmission. Using surveillance
data from the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Anqing together, we inferred that
compared with the elderly aged 60 and over, children aged 18 and under and adults
aged 19-59 were 75% and 32% less susceptible to infection, respectively. Using
transmission models parametrized with synthetic contact matrices for 177
jurisdictions around the world, we showed that the lower susceptibility of school
children substantially limited the effectiveness of school closure in reducing
COVID-19 transmissibility. Our results, together with recent findings that
clinical severity of COVID-19 in children is lower, suggest that school closure
may not be ideal as a sustained, primary intervention for controlling COVID-19.
