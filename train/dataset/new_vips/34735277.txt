Yellow tailflower mild mottle virus (YTMMV, genus Tobamovirus) was identified
from wild plants of solanaceous species in Australia. Nicotiana benthamiana is a 
species indigenous to the arid north of Australia. N. benthamiana accession RA-4 
or the 'lab' type, which has a mutant, functionally-defective, RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase 1 (Rdr1) gene (Nb-Rdr1m), has played a significant role in plant
virology, but little study has been done on responses to virus infection by other
accessions of N. benthamiana. All wild-collected N. benthamiana accessions used
in this study harboured wild-type Rdr1 genes (Nb-Rdr1). We compared symptoms of
YTMMV infection and viral RNA load on RA-4 and nine wild-collected accessions of 
N. benthamiana from mainland Western Australia, an island, and the Northern
Territory. After inoculation with YTMMV, RA-4 plants responded with systemic
hypersensitivity and all individuals were dead 35 days post-inoculation (dpi).
Plants of wild-collected accessions exhibited a range of symptoms, from mild to
severe, and some, but not all, individuals died in the same period. Quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR revealed that the Rdr1 mutation was not a predictor of 
viral RNA load or symptom severity. For example, wild-collected A019412 plants
carried over twice the viral RNA load of RA-4 plants, but symptom expression was 
moderate. For plants of most accessions, viral RNA load did not increase after 10
dpi. The exception was plants of accession Barrow-1, where viral RNA load was low
until 15 dpi, after which it increased over 29-fold. This study revealed
differential responses by N. benthamiana accessions to infection by an isolate of
YTMMV. The Rdr1 gene, whether mutant or wild-type, did not appear to influence
viral RNA load or disease expression. Genetic diversity of the ten N. benthamiana
lines in some cases reflected geographical location, but in other lines this was 
not so.
