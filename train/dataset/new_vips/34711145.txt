Abstract: Australia monitors its polio-free status by conducting surveillance for
cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children less than 15 years of age, as 
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Cases of AFP in children are 
notified to the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit or the Paediatric Active 
Enhanced Disease Surveillance System and faecal specimens are referred for
virological investigation to the National Enterovirus Reference Laboratory. In
2020, no cases of poliomyelitis were reported from clinical surveillance;
Australia reported 1.09 non-polio AFP cases per 100,000 children, thereby meeting
the WHO's performance criterion for a sensitive surveillance system. The
non-polio enteroviruses coxsackievirus A10 and coxsackievirus A16 were identified
from clinical specimens collected from AFP cases. Australia also performs
enterovirus surveillance and environmental surveillance to complement the
clinical system focussed on children. In 2020, there were 140 cases of wild
poliovirus reported from the two remaining endemic countries: Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Another 28 countries reported cases of circulating vaccine-derived
poliovirus.
