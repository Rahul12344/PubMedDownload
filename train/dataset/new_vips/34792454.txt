Across Canada, the long-term care sector has received increased attention since
the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The now often-cited statistic - 
80% of deaths in the first wave occurred among individuals residing in
institutional long-term care - is tragic enough and is only compounded by the
fact that the number of deaths in long-term care were still higher in the second 
wave in all but two provinces. Many have argued that the impact of the pandemic
was amplified in the institutional long-term care sector because of a number of
long-standing shortfalls in funding, space, staffing and infrastructure. For
example, Canadian provinces had lower average direct hours of care (three hours
per day) provided to residents in long-term care facilities than even the average
of four hours per day provided in the United States (Hsu et al. 2016).
