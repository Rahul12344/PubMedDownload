African swine fever (ASF) is a highly infectious and fatal haemorrhagic disease
of pigs that is caused by a complex DNA virus of the genus Asfivirus and
Asfarviridae African suids family. The disease is among the most devastating pig 
diseases worldwide including Africa. Although the disease was first reported in
the 19th century, it has continued to spread in Africa and other parts of the
world. Globally, the rising demand for pork and concomitant increase in
transboundary movements of pigs and pork products is likely to increase the risk 
of transmission and spread of ASF and pose a major challenge to the pig industry.
Different genotypes of the ASF virus (ASFV) with varying virulence have been
associated with different outbreaks in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) and worldwide, and understanding genotype circulation will be important for
ASF prevention and control strategies. ASFV genotypes unique to Africa have also 
been reported in SSA. This review briefly recounts the biology, genomics and
genotyping of ASFV and provides an account of the different genotypes circulating
in SSA. The review also highlights prevention, control and progress on vaccine
development and identifies gaps in knowledge of ASFV genotype circulation in SSA 
that need to be addressed.
