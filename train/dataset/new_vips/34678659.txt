OBJECTIVE: Little is known about CSF profiles in patients with acute COVID-19
infection and neurological symptoms. Here, CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and compared to controls and patients with 
known neurotropic pathogens.
METHODS: CSF from twenty-seven consecutive patients with COVID-19 and
neurological symptoms was assayed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and unbiased metagenomic sequencing. Assays for blood
brain barrier (BBB) breakdown (CSF:serum albumin ratio (Q-Alb)), and
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, IL-16, monocyte
chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1) and monocyte inhibitory protein - 1β (MIP-1β))
were performed in 23 patients and compared to CSF from patients with HIV-1 (16
virally suppressed, 5 unsuppressed), West Nile virus (WNV) (n = 4) and 16 healthy
controls (HC).
RESULTS: Median CSF cell count for COVID-19 patients was 1 white blood cell/μL;
two patients were infected with a second pathogen (Neisseria, Cryptococcus
neoformans). No CSF samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by either detection
method. In patients with COVID-19 only, CSF IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and MIP-1β levels 
were higher than HC and suppressed HIV (corrected-p < 0.05). MCP-1 and MIP-1β
levels were higher, while IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 were similar in COVID-19 compared to 
WNV patients. Q-Alb correlated with all proinflammatory markers, with IL-6, IL-8,
and MIP-1β (r ≥ 0.6, p < 0.01) demonstrating the strongest associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF is consistent with pre-existing
literature. Evidence of intrathecal proinflammatory markers in a subset of
COVID-19 patients with BBB breakdown despite minimal CSF pleocytosis is atypical 
for neurotropic pathogens.
