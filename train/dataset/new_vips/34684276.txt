Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often leads to fibrosis and chronic
hepatitis, then cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The
processes of the HVC life cycle involve intimate interactions between viral and
host cell proteins and lipid metabolism. However, the molecules and mechanisms
involved in this tripartite interaction remain poorly understood. Herein, we show
that the infection of HCC-derived Huh7.5 cells with HCV promotes upregulation of 
the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). Reciprocally, PIAS1 regulated
the expression of HCV core protein and HCV-induced LD accumulation and impaired
HCV replication. Furthermore, PIAS1 controlled HCV-promoted septin 9 filament
formation and microtubule polymerization. Subsequently, we found that PIAS1
interacted with septin 9 and controlled its assembly on filaments, which thus
affected septin 9-induced lipid droplet accumulation. Taken together, these data 
reveal that PIAS1 regulates the accumulation of lipid droplets and offer a
meaningful insight into how HCV interacts with host proteins.
