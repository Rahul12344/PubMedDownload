Recognition of cell-surface glycans is an important step in the attachment of
several viruses to susceptible host cells. The molecular basis of glycan
interactions and their functional consequences are well studied for human
norovirus (HuNoV), an important gastrointestinal pathogen. Histo-blood group
antigens (HBGAs), a family of fucosylated carbohydrate structures that are
present on the cell surface, are utilized by HuNoVs to initially bind to cells.
In this review, we describe the discovery of HBGAs as genetic susceptibility
factors for HuNoV infection and review biochemical and structural studies
investigating HuNoV binding to different HBGA glycans. Recently, human intestinal
enteroids (HIEs) were developed as a laboratory cultivation system for HuNoV. We 
review how the use of this novel culture system has confirmed that fucosylated
HBGAs are necessary and sufficient for infection by several HuNoV strains,
describe mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of infection that involve
blocking of HuNoV binding to HBGAs, and discuss the potential for using the HIE
model to answer unresolved questions on viral interactions with HBGAs and other
glycans.
