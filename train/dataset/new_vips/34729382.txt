Quantifying gene expression in individual cells can substantially improve our
understanding about complex genetically engineered cell products such as chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Here we designed a single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) approach to monitor the delivery of a CD19-CAR gene via lentiviral
vectors (LVs), i.e., the conventional vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-LV and the
CD8-targeted CD8-LV. LV-exposed human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were evaluated for a panel of 400 immune response-related genes including
LV-specific probes. The resulting data revealed a trimodal expression for the CAR
and CD8A, demanding a careful distribution-based identification of CAR T cells
and CD8+ lymphocytes in scRNA-seq analysis. The fraction of T cells expressing
high CAR levels was in concordance with flow cytometry results. More than 97% of 
the cells hit by CD8-LV expressed the CD8A gene. Remarkably, the majority of the 
potential off-target cells were in fact on-target cells, resulting in a target
cell selectivity of more than 99%. Beyond that, differential gene expression
analysis revealed the upregulation of restriction factors in CAR-negative cells, 
thus explaining their protection from CAR gene transfer. In summary, we provide a
workflow and subsetting approach for scRNA-seq enabling reliable distinction
between transduced and untransduced cells during CAR T cell generation.
