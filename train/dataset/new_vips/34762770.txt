INTRODUCTION: A potential concern with the use of dapivirine (DPV) for HIV
prevention is the selection of a drug-resistant virus that could spread and
reduce the effectiveness of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based
first-line antiretroviral therapy. We evaluated HIV-1 seroconversions in
MTN-020/ASPIRE for selection of drug resistance and evaluated the genetic basis
for observed reductions in susceptibility to DPV.
METHODS: MTN-020/ASPIRE was a placebo-controlled, Phase III safety and
effectiveness study of DPV ring for HIV-1 prevention conducted at 15 sites in
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Uganda between 2012 and 2015. Plasma from
individuals who seroconverted in ASPIRE was analysed for HIV-1 drug resistance
using both population Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with
unique molecular identifiers to report mutations at ≥1% frequency. DPV
susceptibility of plasma-derived recombinant HIV-1 containing bulk-cloned
full-length reverse transcriptase sequences from MTN-020/ASPIRE seroconversions
was determined in TZM-bl cells. Statistical significance was calculated using the
Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Plasma from all 168 HIV seroconversions were successfully tested by
Sanger sequencing; 57 of 71 DPV arm and 82 of 97 placebo (PLB) arm participants
had NGS results at 1% sensitivity. Overall, 18/168 (11%) had NNRTI mutations
including K101E, K103N/S, V106M, V108I, E138A/G, V179D/I/T and H221Y. Five
samples from both arms had low-frequency NNRTI mutations that were not detected
by Sanger sequencing. The frequency of NNRTI mutations from the DPV arm (11%) was
not different from the PLB arm (10%; p = 0.80). The E138A mutation was detected
in both the DPV (3 of 71 [4.2%]) and PLB arm (5 of 97 [5.2%]) and conferred
modest reductions in DPV susceptibility in some reverse transcriptase backgrounds
but not others.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 drug resistance including NNRTI resistance did not differ
between the DPV and placebo arms of the MTN-020/ASPIRE study, indicating that
drug resistance was not preferentially acquired or selected by the DPV ring and
that the preventive benefit of DPV ring outweighs resistance risk.
