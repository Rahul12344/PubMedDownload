Host-directed therapy (HDT) is gaining traction as a strategy to combat
infectious diseases caused by viruses and intracellular bacteria, but its
implementation in the context of parasitic diseases has received less attention. 
Here, we provide a brief overview of this field and advocate HDT as a promising
strategy for antimalarial intervention based on untapped targets. HDT provides a 
basis from which repurposed drugs could be rapidly deployed and is likely to
strongly limit the emergence of resistance. This strategy can be applied to any
intracellular pathogen and is particularly well placed in situations in which
rapid identification of treatments is needed, such as emerging infections and
pandemics, as starkly illustrated by the current COVID-19 crisis.
