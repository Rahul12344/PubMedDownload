World in which we live in, has been changing so unpredictably in the recent years
that has become more than ever volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) 
world. Especially in this post Covid-19 era in which extreme change has becomes
our constant, economies around the world are suffering and today's organizations 
and institutions are broken. We can agree that our current approach is not
working. Leadership in general and leaders of global mental health institutions
in particular are failing on their goals and we have desperate need for better
leaders and leadership strategies in the future. In this article, authors are
going to take a dive on the leadership perspective, transformation of
organizations and institutions and try to narrow the gap and support leaders to
become the best version of themselves. We are going to present our perspective on
what is the future bringing us in terms of leadership and leaders, as well as
what would be the desired team dynamic within organizations or institutions.
