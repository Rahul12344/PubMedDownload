N-glycosylation plays an important role in the structure and function of membrane
and secreted proteins. The spike protein on the surface of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, 
is heavily glycosylated and the major target for developing vaccines, therapeutic
drugs and diagnostic tests. The first major SARS-CoV-2 variant carries a D614G
substitution in the spike (S-D614G) that has been associated with altered
conformation, enhanced ACE2 binding, and increased infectivity and transmission. 
In this report, we used mass spectrometry techniques to characterize and compare 
the N-glycosylation of the wild type (S-614D) or variant (S-614G) SARS-CoV-2
spike glycoproteins prepared under identical conditions. The data showed that
half of the N-glycosylation sequons changed their distribution of glycans in the 
S-614G variant. The S-614G variant showed a decrease in the relative abundance of
complex-type glycans (up to 45%) and an increase in oligomannose glycans (up to
33%) on all altered sequons. These changes led to a reduction in the overall
complexity of the total N-glycosylation profile. All the glycosylation sites with
altered patterns were in the spike head while the glycosylation of three sites in
the stalk remained unchanged between S-614G and S-614D proteins.
