Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is involved in the development of cancer 
of the cervix, mouth and throat, anus, penis, vulva, or vagina, but it has not
been much considered as a cause of breast cancer. Recently, a number of
investigations have linked breast cancer to viral infections. High-risk HPV
types, predominantly HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and
59, are established as carcinogens in humans. In this study we aimed to detect 19
high-risk and 9 low-risk HPVs from archived breast tumor tissue among Ethiopian
women.
Methods: In this study, 75 breast cancer patients from Tikur Anbassa Specialized 
Hospital in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) were included. HPV detection and genotyping
were done using the novel Anyplex™ II HPV28 Detection Assay at the Orebro
University Hospital, Sweden. The Anyplex™ II PCR System detects 19 high-risk HPV 
types (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 69, 73,
and 82) and 9 low-risk HPV types (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, and 70). IHC for
p16 was done using an automated system, the Dako Autostainer Link.
Results: Out of the 75 valid tests, two were found to be positive (2.7%) for HPV.
One of the cases was positive for the high-risk HPV16 genotype while the other
was positive both for the high-risk HPV39 and the low-risk HPV6. The cell cycle
protein p16 was highly expressed in the case positive for the high-risk HPV16,
but it was not expressed in the case positive for HPV39.
Conclusion: The prevalence of HPV is low in Ethiopian breast cancer patients, but
the role played by HPV in breast carcinogenesis among Ethiopian breast cancer
patients cannot be commented based on these observations.
