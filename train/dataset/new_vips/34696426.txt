The livestock industry is constantly threatened by viral disease outbreaks,
including infections with zoonotic potential. While preventive vaccination is
frequently applied, disease control and eradication also depend on strict
biosecurity measures. Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) and associated proteins (Cas) have been repurposed as genome editors to 
induce targeted double-strand breaks at almost any location in the genome. Thus, 
CRISPR/Cas genome editors can also be utilized to generate disease-resistant or
resilient livestock, develop vaccines, and further understand virus-host
interactions. Genes of interest in animals and viruses can be targeted to
understand their functions during infection. Furthermore, transgenic animals
expressing CRISPR/Cas can be generated to target the viral genome upon infection.
Genetically modified livestock can thereby reduce disease outbreaks and decrease 
zoonotic threats.
