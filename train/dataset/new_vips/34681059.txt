It has been over a year since SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in December of 2019
in Wuhan, China. To curb the spread of the virus, many therapies and cures have
been tested and developed, most notably mRNA and DNA vaccines. Federal health
agencies (CDC, FDA) have approved emergency usage of these S gene-based vaccines 
with the intention of minimizing any further loss of lives and infections. It is 
crucial to assess which vaccines are the most efficacious by examining their
effects on the immune system, and by providing considerations for new
technological vaccine strategies in the future. This paper provides an overview
of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with their mechanisms of action, current
technologies utilized in manufacturing of the vaccines, and limitations in this
new field with emerging data. Although the most popular COVID-19 vaccines have
been proven effective, time will be the main factor in dictating which vaccine
will be able to best address mutations and future infection.
