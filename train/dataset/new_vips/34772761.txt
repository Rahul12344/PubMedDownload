Many phylogenetically distant animal viruses, including the new coronavirus
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, have surface proteins with
polybasic sites that are cleaved by host furin and furin-like proteases. Other
than priming certain viral surface proteins for fusion, cleavage generates a
carboxy-terminal RXXR sequence. This C-end Rule (CendR) motif is known to bind to
neuropilin (NRP) receptors on the cell surface. NRPs are ubiquitously expressed, 
pleiotropic cell surface receptors with important roles in growth factor
signaling, vascular biology, and neurobiology, as well as immune homeostasis and 
activation. The CendR-NRP receptor interaction promotes endocytic internalization
and tissue spreading of different cargo, including viral particles. We propose
that the interaction between viral surface proteins and NRPs plays an
underappreciated and prevalent role in the transmission and pathogenesis of
diverse viruses and represents a promising broad-spectrum antiviral target.
