Childhood and adolescence are vulnerable and crucial phases for determining
health in adulthood. Despite the enormous progress achieved in child and
adolescent's health and well-being globally, the disability burden has remained
almost unchanged. In 2019, in Italy and globally, low back pain, headache
disorders, depression, and anxiety were among the first causes of disability.
Through the analysis of the estimates of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,
we propose a reflection on the state of health of the Italian paediatric and
adolescent population in terms of disability, suggesting recommendations on
preventive actions, and public health interventions. The aim is the improvement
of their health, considering how the current COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on
their quality of life.
