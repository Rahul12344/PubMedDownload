replication in primary macrophages.

S100A8 and S100A9 are members of the Alarmin family; these proteins are
abundantly expressed in neutrophils and form a heterodimer complex. Recently,
both proteins were identified as novel biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
were shown to play key roles in inducing an aggressive inflammatory response by
mediating the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, called the 
"cytokine storm." Although co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in people living with
HIV-1 may result in an immunocompromised status, the role of the S100A8/A9
complex in HIV-1 replication in primary T cells and macrophages is still unclear.
Here, we evaluated the roles of the proteins in HIV replication to elucidate
their functions. We found that the complex had no impact on virus replication in 
both cell types; however, the subunits of S100A8 and S100A9 inhibits HIV in
macrophages. These findings provide important insights into the regulation of HIV
viral loads in SARS-CoV2 co-infection.
