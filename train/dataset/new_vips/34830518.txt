BACKGROUND: Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a protease inhibitor-containing
pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral regimen that has been approved for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The present study aimed to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients with compensated cirrhosis
in a real-world setting.
METHODS: We evaluated the real-world safety and efficacy of
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients with compensated cirrhosis from five
hospitals in the Changhua Christian Care System, who underwent treatment between 
August 2018 and October 2020. The primary endpoint was a sustained virological
response observed 12 weeks after completion of the treatment.
RESULTS: Ninety patients, including 70 patients who received the 12-week therapy 
and 20 patients who received the 8-week therapy, were enrolled. The mean age of
the patients was 65 years, and 57.8% of the patients were males. Sixteen (17.8%) 
patients had end-stage renal disease, and 15 (16.7%) had co-existing hepatoma.
The hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 (40%) and 2 (35.6%) were most common. The
common side effects included anorexia (12.2%), pruritus (7.8%), abdominal
discomfort (7.8%), and malaise (7.8%). Laboratory adverse grade â‰¥3 events
included anemia (6.3%), thrombocytopenia (5.1%), and jaundice (2.2%). The overall
sustained virological response rates were 94.4% and 97.7% in the
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: the glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment regimen was highly effective 
and well tolerated among patients with compensated cirrhosis in the real-world
setting.
