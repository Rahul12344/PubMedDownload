Considering a steady increase in the number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantations (allo-HSCT) worldwide and the significant proportion of the
world's population that has been exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,
HBV reactivation following allo-HSCT remains an important issue for
post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Antiviral prophylaxis can reduce HBV
replication, severity of HBV-related hepatitis, and mortality; therefore,
identification of patients at risk is crucial. It is recommended that all
recipients and donors should be screened for active or prior HBV infection,
including HBsAg, antiHBc, and antiHBs. Adoptive immunity transfer from the donor 
seems to have protective effects against HBV reactivation. Antiviral prophylaxis 
should be initiated in all HBsAg-positive patients. HBsAg-negative,
antiHBc-positive patients remain at risk; therefore, antiviral prophylaxis should
be considered if baseline serum HBV DNA is detectable. In HBsAg-negative,
antiHBc-positive patients without detectable HBV DNA, close monitoring of viral
load with an on-demand therapy is necessary. Entecavir or tenofovir rather than
lamivudine are more appropriate for the emergence of lamivudine resistance. The
treatment duration remains unclear, with 6- to 12-month therapy after cessation
of immunosuppressive therapy commonly recommended. Here we review the updated
evidence and recent recommendations regarding HBV reactivation in patients
undergoing allo-HSCT for individualized therapy.
