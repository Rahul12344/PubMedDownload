BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causing agent of the Coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) characterized by a huge pro-inflammatory response and coagulation
disorders that may lead to for its severe forms, in organ failure or even death. 
As major players of thrombo-inflammation, platelets release large amounts of
immunomodulatory molecules and regulate leukocyte and endothelial activity, which
are both altered in COVID-19. Altogether, this makes platelets a very likely
actor of the thrombo-inflammatory complications of COVID-19. Thus, we propose to 
identify a platelet inflammatory signature of severe COVID-19 specifically
modulated throughout the course of the disease.
METHODS: Luminex technology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to
assess plasma levels of platelet inflammatory markers in patients with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on admission and for 14 days
afterwards.
RESULTS: In accordance with the observations of other teams, we evidence that the
plasma levels of the platelet soluble (s)CD40L is significantly elevated in the
early stages of the disease. Interestingly we observe that the plasma level of
sCD40L decreases overtime while that of sCD62P increases significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a platelet signature of inflammatory 
response to SARS-COv-2 infection which varies overtime and could serve as
monitoring biomarkers of patient inflammatory state.
