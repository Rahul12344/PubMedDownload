Influenza A viruses (IAV) are widespread viruses affecting avian and mammalian
species worldwide. IAVs from avian species can be transmitted to mammals
including humans and, thus, they are of inherent pandemic concern. Most of the
efforts to understand the pathogenicity and transmission of avian origin IAVs
have been focused on H5 and H7 subtypes due to their highly pathogenic phenotype 
in poultry. However, IAV of the H9 subtype, which circulate endemically in
poultry flocks in some regions of the world, have also been associated with cases
of zoonotic infections. In this review, we discuss the mammalian transmission of 
H9N2 and the molecular factors that are thought relevant for this spillover,
focusing on the HA segment. Additionally, we discuss factors that have been
associated with the ability of these viruses to transmit through the respiratory 
route in mammalian species. The summarized information shows that minimal amino
acid changes in the HA and/or the combination of H9N2 surface genes with internal
genes of human influenza viruses are enough for the generation of H9N2 viruses
with the ability to transmit via aerosol.
