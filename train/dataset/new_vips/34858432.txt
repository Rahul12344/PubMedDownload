The influenza A virus (IAV) causes a respiratory tract infection with
approximately 10% of the population infected by the virus each year. Severe IAV
infection is characterized by excessive inflammation and tissue pathology in the 
lungs. Platelet and neutrophil recruitment to the lung are involved in the
pathogenesis of IAV, but the specific mechanisms involved have not been
clarified. Using confocal intravital microscopy in a mouse model of IAV
infection, we observed profound neutrophil recruitment, platelet aggregation,
neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production and thrombin activation within the
lung microvasculature in vivo. Importantly, deficiency or antagonism of the
protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) reduced platelet aggregation, NET
production, and neutrophil recruitment. Critically, inhibition of thrombin or
PAR4 protected mice from virus-induced lung tissue damage and edema. Together,
these data imply thrombin-stimulated platelets play a critical role in the
activation/recruitment of neutrophils, NET release and directly contribute to IAV
pathogenesis in the lung.
