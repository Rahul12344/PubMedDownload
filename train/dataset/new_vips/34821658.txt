The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global healthcare threat,
particularly chronic hepatitis B (CHB) that might lead to hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) should not be neglected. Although many types of HBV diagnosis
detection methods are available, some technical challenges, such as the high cost
or lack of practical feasibility, need to be overcome. In this study, the
polycrystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (pSiNWFETs) were
fabricated through commercial process technology and then chemically
functionalized for sensing hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and
hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) at the femto-molar level. These two proteins
have been suggested to be related to the HCC development, while the former is
also the hallmark for HBV diagnosis, and the latter is an RNA-binding protein.
Interestingly, these two proteins carried opposite net charges, which could serve
as complementary candidates for evaluating the charge-based sensing mechanism in 
the pSiNWFET. The measurements on the threshold voltage shifts of pSiNWFETs
showed a consistent correspondence to the polarity of the charges on the proteins
studied. We believe that this report can pave the way towards developing an
approachable tool for biomedical applications.
