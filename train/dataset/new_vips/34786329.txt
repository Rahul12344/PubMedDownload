Objective: : Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments globally have
introduced policy measures to contain the spread of the virus. Popular COVID-19
containment measures include lockdowns of various forms (aggregated into
government response stringency index [GRSI]) and handwashing (HWF). The
effectiveness of these policy measures remains unclear in the academic
literature. This study, therefore, examines the effect of government policy
stringency and handwashing on total daily reported COVID-19 cases.
Method: : We use a comprehensive dataset of 176 countries to investigate the
effect of government policy stringency and handwashing on daily reported COVID-19
cases. In this study, we apply the Lewbel (2012) two-stage least squares
technique to control endogeneity.
Results: : Our results indicated that GRSI significantly contributes to the
increase in the total and new confirmed cases of COVI-19. Sensitivity analyses
revealed that the 1st, 4th, and 5th quintiles of GRIS significantly reduce total 
confirmed cases of COVID-19. Also, the result indicated that while the 1st
quintile of GRIS contributes significantly to reducing the new confirmed cases of
COVID-19, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintiles of GRSI contribute significantly to
increasing the new confirmed cases of COVID-19. The results indicated that HWF
reduces total and new confirmed cases of COVID-19; however, such effect is not
robust to income and regional effects. Nonlinear analysis revealed that while
GRSI has an inverted U-shaped relationship with total and new confirmed cases of 
COVID-19, HWF has a U-shaped relationship.
Conclusion: : We suggest that policymakers should focus on raising awareness and 
full engagement of all members of society in implementing public health policies 
rather than using stringent lockdown measures.
