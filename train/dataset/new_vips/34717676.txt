We, and others, have suggested that as the SARS-CoV-2 virus may modulate
mitochondrial function, good mitochondrial reserve and health could be key in
determining disease severity when exposed to this virus, as the immune system
itself is dependent on this organelle's function. With the recent publication of 
a paper showing that long COVID could be associated with the reactivation of the 
Epstein Barr Virus, which is well known to manipulate mitochondria, we suggest
that this could represent a second mitochondrial "whammy" that might support the 
mitochondrial hypothesis underlying COVID-19 severity and potentially, the
occurrence of longer-term symptoms. As mitochondrial function declines with age, 
this could be an important factor in why older populations are more susceptible. 
Key factors which ensure optimal mitochondrial health are generally those that
ensure healthy ageing, such as a good lifestyle with plenty of physical activity.
The ability of viruses to manipulate mitochondrial function is well described,
and it is now also thought that for evolutionary reasons, they also manipulate
the ageing process. Given that slowing the ageing process could well be linked to
better economic outcomes, the link between mitochondrial health, economics,
COVID-19 and other viruses, as well as lifestyle, needs to be considered.
