The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the increased susceptibility of individuals
with obesity to infection and severe disease leading to hospitalization and
death. Studies in New York City demonstrated that after advanced age, obesity was
the most common risk factor leading to severe disease and death from COVID-19.
While the connection has been recognized, there has not been a general
recognition of the potential mechanisms for this link between excess body fat and
mortality from this viral pandemic including respiratory complications and
sequelae of increased activation of the immune system. Despite plans for
vaccination of the global population, the risk community spread of COVID-19 and
future pandemics will be linked in part to obesity and immunity. This review will
detail a number of potential mechanisms through which obesity may contribute to
the lethality of this viral infection. These insights will hopefully lead to a
greater emphasis on obesity prevention and treatment as part of the global
response to this and future pandemic threats.
