Since the COVID-19 outbreak, teledermatology services have become an integral
part of our daily practice. In this study, we compared three practice models of
an academic department in an urban setting: 1) in-person only, 2) teledermatology
only, and 3) hybrid of in-person and teledermatology. Our study demonstrated that
older patients prefer in-person visits over teledermatology visits, while
non-English-speaking patients prefer teledermatology visits over in-person
visits. In addition, teledermatology services can be better utilized for
evaluation of acne and psoriasis, as these diagnoses do not require in-person
reevaluation, unlike the evaluation of concerning lesions. Considering these
findings, our study highlights the need to continuously examine our practice
models to understand patient preferences, overcome practice-driven barriers, and 
ensure the sound allocation of limited health care resources.
