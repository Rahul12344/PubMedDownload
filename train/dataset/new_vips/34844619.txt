BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) serum markers during typical acute
self-limited infection are usually depicted as a composite of traditional HBV
markers. The current study updates and expands our knowledge of acute hepatitis B
with quantitative molecular and serological data on longitudinal samples from
five plasmapheresis donors with acute HBV.
METHODS: 137 longitudinal samples from five plasmapheresis donors with acute HBV 
were tested, four with self-limited infection and one who developed persistent
infection. Testing included quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
antibodies to HBV antigens, quantitative HBV e antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA,
quantitative HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), the highly sensitive ARCHITECT
HBsAg NEXT (HBsAgNx) assay, and a quantitative research assay for HBV pregenomic 
RNA (pg RNA).
RESULTS: Peak levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg differed by several orders of magnitude
among the panels (2.2 × 105-2.7 × 109 IU/ml for HBV DNA and 7.9-1.1 × 105 IU/ml
for HBsAg). HBsAg levels peaked an average of 2.8 days after the HBV DNA peak.
The overall duration of observed HBsAg positivity was increased by the more
sensitive HBsAgNx assay compared to the quantitative assay in four panels.
Intermittently detectable low-level HBV DNA was observed after HBsAg loss in
three panels. Peak HBeAg levels occurred 2-20 days after the DNA peak and ranged 
from 1.1 to 4.5 × 103 IU/ml. In four panels with resolution of infection,
anti-HBs levels indicating immunity (≥ 10 mIU/ml) were detected 19-317 days after
the HBV DNA peak. Maximum HBcrAg concentrations ranged from 1 × 105
to > 6.4 × 106 U/ml and correlated with HBeAg values (R2 = 0.9495) and with HBV
DNA values (R2 = 0.8828). Peak pgRNA values ranged from 1.6 × 103 to
1.4 × 108 U/ml and correlated with HBV DNA (R2 = 0.9013).
CONCLUSION: Traditional and new/novel HBV biomarkers were used to generate
molecular and serological profiles for seroconversion panels spanning the early
to late phases of acute HBV. Seroconversion profiles were heterogeneous and may
be instructive in appreciating the spectrum of acute profiles relative to the
typical composite representation.
