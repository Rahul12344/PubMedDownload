BACKGROUND: Xinjiang is one of the regions with a high incidence of cervical
cancer, and the genetic variation of human papillomavirus may increase its
ability to infect the human body and enhance virus-mediated immune escape
ability.
METHODS: Sanger sequencing of the HPV16 genome from 165 samples positive for
HPV16 infection and phylogenetic analysis of the E1 and E2 genes revealed the
gene polymorphism of HPV16 in Xinjiang.
RESULTS: The results showed that there were 109 samples with variations in HPV16 
E1, 48 sites with nucleotide variations (19 missense variations and 29 synonymous
variations), and 91 samples with variations in HPV16 E2, 25 sites with nucleotide
variations (20 missense variations and five synonymous variations).
CONCLUSIONS: From the phylogenetic tree results, 149 samples were of the European
variant and 16 samples were of the Asian variant. No African or North
American/Asian variant types were found.
