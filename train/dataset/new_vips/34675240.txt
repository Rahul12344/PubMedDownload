In Europe, multiple waves of infections with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have been
observed. Here, we have investigated whether common patterns of cytokines could
be detected in individuals with mild and severe forms of COVID-19 in two pandemic
waves, and whether machine learning approach could be useful to identify the best
predictors. An increasing trend of multiple cytokines was observed in patients
with mild or severe/critical symptoms of COVID-19, compared with healthy
volunteers. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) clearly recognized the three
groups based on cytokine patterns. Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
further indicated that IL-6 discriminated controls and COVID-19 patients, whilst 
IL-8 defined disease severity. During the second wave of pandemics, a less
intense cytokine storm was observed, as compared with the first. IL-6 was the
most robust predictor of infection and discriminated moderate COVID-19 patients
from healthy controls, regardless of epidemic peak curve. Thus, serum cytokine
patterns provide biomarkers useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. Further 
definition of individual cytokines may allow to envision novel therapeutic
options and pave the way to set up innovative diagnostic tools.
