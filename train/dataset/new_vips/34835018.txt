Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emergent alphavirus that causes MAYV fever. It is often
associated with debilitating symptoms, particularly arthralgia and myalgia. MAYV 
infection is becoming a considerable health issue that, unfortunately, lacks a
specific antiviral treatment. Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, has
recently been shown to exert anti-MAYV activity in vitro. In the present study,
the potential of Favipiravir to inhibit MAYV replication in an in vivo model was 
evaluated. Immunocompetent mice were orally administrated 300 mg/kg/dose of
Favipiravir at pre-, concurrent-, or post-MAYV infection. The results showed a
significant reduction in infectious viral particles and viral RNA transcripts in 
the tissues and blood of the pre- and concurrently treated infected mice. A
significant reduction in the presence of both viral RNA transcript and infectious
viral particles in the tissue and blood of pre- and concurrently treated infected
mice was observed. By contrast, Favipiravir treatment post-MAYV infection did not
result in a reduction in viral replication. Interestingly, Favipiravir strongly
decreased the blood levels of the liver disease markers aspartate- and alanine
aminotransferase in the pre- and concurrently treated MAYV-infected mice. Taken
together, these results suggest that Favipiravir is a potent antiviral drug when 
administered in a timely manner.
