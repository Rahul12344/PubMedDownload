Impressive efforts have been made by researchers worldwide in the development of 
target vaccines against the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) and in improving the management of immunomodulating agents.
Currently, different vaccine formulations, such as viral vector, mRNA, and
protein-based, almost all directed toward the spike protein that includes the
domain for receptor binding, have been approved. Although data are not
conclusive, patients affected by autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) seem to
have a slightly higher disease prevalence, risk of hospitalization, and death
from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) than the general population. Therefore, 
ARD patients, under immunosuppressive agents, have been included among the
priority target groups for vaccine administration. However, specific cautions are
needed to optimize vaccine safety and effectiveness in these patients, such as
modification in some of the ongoing immunosuppressive therapies and the
preferential use of mRNA other than vector-based vaccines. Immunomodulating
agents can be a therapeutic opportunity for the management of COVID-19 patients; 
however, their clinical impact depends on how they are handled. To place in
therapy immunomodulating agents in the correct window of opportunity throughout
the identification of surrogate markers of disease progression and host immune
response is mandatory to optimize patient's outcome.
