Primary Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-associated pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like
carcinoma (LELC) is an aggressive rare cancer. Higher incidences have been
observed in Asian sub-populations. Multimodal treatment paradigms have emerged as
promising novel strategies in the management of advanced NSCLC. In this report,
we describe the case of a 34-year-old female patient of Asian origin with a
post-partum initial diagnosis of pulmonary LELC. Multimodal treatment with
chemoimmunotherapy and hypofractionated irradiation to the primary tumour and
main metastatic sites led to a favourable response demonstrating that
radiotherapy may potentially augment anti-tumour immunity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first case report on this novel therapy strategy of
multi-site hypofractionated radiotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy for metastatic
pulmonary EBV-associated LELC.
