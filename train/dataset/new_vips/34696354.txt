Viruses are an underappreciated cause of heart failure. Indeed, several types of 
viral infections carry cardiovascular risks. Understanding shared and unique
mechanisms by which each virus compromises heart function is critical to inform
on therapeutic interventions. This review describes how the key viruses known to 
lead to cardiac dysfunction operate. Both direct host-damaging mechanisms and
indirect actions on the immune systems are discussed. As viral myocarditis is a
key pathologic driver of heart failure in infected individuals, this review also 
highlights the role of cytokine storms and inflammation in virus-induced
cardiomyopathy.
