PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Poor cardiovascular outcomes are linked to COVID-19 in
patients with or without prior cardiovascular disease or risk factors.
Echocardiography, as a portable, versatile, and comprehensive imaging technique, 
has been on the frontlines. Yet sonographers and physician imagers are at
increased risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent scientific statements incorporate triaging approaches to 
identify the appropriateness of imaging exam indications, coupled with triaging
of indications. Additionally, focused protocols, procedures to reduce exposure,
and point-of-care ultrasound play significant roles. Lessons learned during
COVID-19 will apply to future pandemics. Echocardiography is a key diagnostic
modality during pandemics in patients with or without prior cardiac diseases and 
risk factors. Attention to clinical questions, focused protocols, novel
procedures, and future developments in imaging will contribute to safe and
effective practice of echocardiography.
