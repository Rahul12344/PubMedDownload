BACKGROUND: Symptomatic COVID-19 cases in children occur mostly in those with
primary immunodeficiency (PID), chronic lung diseases, and heart disease.
Guidelines recommend that patients with PID continue to use their regular
medication during the pandemic.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate anxiety related to COVID-19 in the
parents of patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment in our 
hospital and to evaluate the effect of their anxiety on the continuity of
treatment.
METHODS: The parents of the patients who underwent IVIG therapy in our clinic
during the pandemic (between May 15, 2020 and July 1, 2020) were included in our 
study.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with PID whose IVIG therapy was initiated before
the pandemic and 29 non- PID control subjects were included in the study. All
patients received IVIG treatment in our clinic continued treatment during the
pandemic at the same dose intervals. Parents in the IVIG group had significantly 
higher state (p=0.003) and trait (p=0.003) anxiety scores compared to control
parents. IVIG group showed statistically significant higher scores in Beck
depression inventory, than the control group (p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The parents of PID patients who needed to come to the hospital for
IVIG therapy had higher anxiety levels than the parents of similar aged children 
who presented to our clinic for different complaints between the same dates.
Despite their concerns, the parents of all patients under IVIG therapy maintained
treatment continuity at the recommended treatment intervals. None of our
immunodeficient patients who presented for treatment during the pandemic
contracted COVID-19 infection during our study.
