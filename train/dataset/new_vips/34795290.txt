We developed a SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit vaccine formulation containing dual TLR
ligand liposome adjuvant. The vaccine-induced robust systemic neutralizing
antibodies and completely protected mice from a lethal challenge. Two
immunizations protected against lung injury and cleared the virus from lungs upon
challenge. The adjuvanted vaccine also elicited systemic and local anti-Spike IgA
which can be an important feature for a COVID-19 vaccine.
