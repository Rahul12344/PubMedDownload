Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne pathogen that
regularly causes severe neurological disease in humans in Southeast Asia and the 
Western Pacific region. Pigs are one of the main amplifying hosts of JEV and play
a central role in the virus transmission cycle. The objective of this study was
to identify in vitro cell systems to investigate early effects of JEV infection
including viral replication and host cell death. Here, we demonstrate the
susceptibility of several porcine cell lines to the attenuated genotype III JEV
strain SA14-14-2. Monolayers of porcine nasal turbinate (PT-K75), kidney
(SK-RST), testis (ST), and monocyte-derived macrophage (CΔ2+) cells were infected
with SA14-14-2 for up to five days at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1.
The hamster kidney cell line BHK-21, previously shown to be susceptible to
SA14-14-2, was used as a positive control. Culture supernatants and cells were
collected between 0 and 120 h post infection (hpi), and monolayers were observed 
for cytopathic effect (CPE) using brightfield microscopy. The number of
infectious virus particles was quantified by plaque assay and cell viability was 
determined using trypan blue staining. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was
used to detect the presence of JEV NS1 antigens in cells infected at 1 MOI. All
four porcine cell lines demonstrated susceptibility to SA14-14-2 and produced
infectious virus by 12 hpi. Virus titers peaked at 48 hpi in CΔ2+, BHK-21, and
SK-RST cells, at 72 hpi in PT-K75, and at 120 hpi in ST cells. CPE was visible in
infected CΔ2+ and BHK-21 cells, but not the other three cell lines. The
proportion of viable cells, as measured by trypan blue exclusion, declined after 
24 hpi in BHK-21 and 48 hpi in CΔ2+ cells, but did not substantially decline in
SK-RST, PT-K75 or ST cells. At 48 hpi, JEV NS1 was detected in all infected cell 
lines by fluorescence microscopy. These findings demonstrate several porcine cell
lines which have the potential to serve as useful research tools for
investigating JEV infection dynamics and host cell mechanisms in a natural
amplifying host species, such as pigs, in vitro.
