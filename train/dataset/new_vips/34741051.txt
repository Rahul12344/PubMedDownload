Coronavirus with intact infectivity attached to PPE surfaces pose significant
threat to the spread of COVID-19. We tested the hypothesis that an
electroceutical fabric, generating weak potential difference of 0.5 V, disrupts
the infectivity of coronavirus upon contact by destabilizing the electrokinetic
properties of the virion. Porcine respiratory coronavirus AR310 particles (105)
were placed in direct contact with the fabric for 1 or 5 min. Following one
minute of contact, zeta potential of the porcine coronavirus was significantly
lowered indicating destabilization of its electrokinetic properties.
Size-distribution plot showed appearance of aggregation of the virus. Testing of 
the cytopathic effects of the virus showed eradication of infectivity as
quantitatively assessed by PI-calcein and MTT cell viability tests. This work
provides the rationale to consider the studied electroceutical fabric, or other
materials with comparable property, as material of choice for the development of 
PPE in the fight against COVID-19.
