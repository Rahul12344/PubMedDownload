Background: Expanding antiviral therapy to benefit more populations and
optimizing treatment to improve prognoses are two main objectives in current
guidelines on antiviral therapy. However, the guidelines do not recommend
antiviral therapy for inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers
(IHCs). Recent studies have shown that antiviral therapy is effective with good
treatment outcomes in IHC populations. We conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis of HBsAg clearance and conversion in IHCs.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science to retrieve
articles on HBsAg clearance in IHCs published between January 2000 and August
2021. Data were collected and analysed using the random-effects model for
meta-analysis.
Results: A total of 1029 IHCs from 11 studies were included in this analysis. The
overall HBsAg clearance rate was 47% (95% confidence interval (CI): 31% - 64%),
with a conversion rate of 26% (95% CI: 15% - 38%) after 48 weeks of Pegylated
interferon (Peg-IFN) treatment. In the control group (including nucleos(t)ide
analogue (NA) treatment or no treatment), the overall HBsAg clearance rate was
only 1.54% (95% CI: 0.56% - 3.00%), which was markedly lower than that in the
Peg-IFN group. Further analysis showed that a low baseline HBsAg level and long
treatment duration contributed to a higher HBsAg clearance rate.
Conclusion: This study showed that treatment of IHCs can be considered to achieve
a clinical cure for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. After Peg-IFN
treatment, the HBsAg clearance rate was 47%, and the conversion rate was 26%,
which are markedly higher than those reported by previous studies on Peg-IFN
treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A low baseline HBsAg level 
and long treatment duration were associated with HBsAg clearance in IHCs.
Therefore, antiviral therapy is applicable for IHCs, a population who may be
clinically cured.
