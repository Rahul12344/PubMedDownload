Drought stress is an alarming constraint to plant growth, development, and
productivity worldwide. However, plant-associated bacteria, fungi, and viruses
can enhance stress resistance and cope with the negative impacts of drought
through the induction of various mechanisms, which involve plant biochemical and 
physiological changes. These mechanisms include osmotic adjustment, antioxidant
enzyme enhancement, modification in phytohormonal levels, biofilm production,
increased water and nutrient uptake as well as increased gas exchange and water
use efficiency. Production of microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) and
induction of stress-responsive genes by microbes also play a crucial role in the 
acquisition of drought tolerance. This review offers a unique exploration of the 
role of plant-associated microorganisms-plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and 
mycorrhizae, viruses, and their interactions-in the plant microbiome (or
phytobiome) as a whole and their modes of action that mitigate plant drought
stress.
