Split-virus vaccine serves as a major countermeasure against influenza virus, but
its effectiveness and protective action are not complete. We previously
demonstrated the effect of Benifuuki, a green tea cultivar in Japan, on enhancing
the split-virus vaccine-elicited immune response. However, little is known about 
the detail mechanisms. Here, we show that EGCG3"Me intake significantly
potentiated the vaccine-elicited hemagglutination inhibition titer increase. Flow
cytometry analysis revealed the increased Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) expression 
after EGCG3"Me treatment in lamina propria dendritic cells (LPDCs) and
macrophages, which play crucial roles in the humoral immune system. TLR5
expression correlated with the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6)/C-C chemokine type
receptor 5, which are important mediators of the humoral immunity. Taken
together, In vivo and ex vivo studies showed that EGCG3"Me potentiated the
split-virus vaccine-elicited immune response accompanied with the upregulation of
TLR5 in intestine and splenocyte macrophages.
