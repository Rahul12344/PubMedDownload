Bacterial culture methods, e.g. Plate Counting Method (PCM), are a gold standard 
in the assessment of microbial contamination in multitude of human industries.
They are however slow, labor intensive, and prone to manual errors.
Dielectrophoresis (DEP) has shown great promise for particle separation for
decades; however, it has not yet been widely applied in routine laboratory
setting. This paper provides an overview of a new DEP microbial capture and
separation method called Fluid-Screen (FS), that achieves very fast, efficient,
reliable and repeatable capture and separation of microbial cells. Method
verification experiments demonstrated that the FS system captured 100% of
bacteria in test samples, a capture efficiency much higher than previously
reported for similar technology. Data generated supports the superiority of the
FS method as compared to the established Plate Counting Method (PCM), that is
routinely used to detect bacterial contamination in healthcare, pharmacological
and food industries. We demonstrate that the FS method is universal and can
capture and separate different species of bacteria and fungi to viruses, from
various sample matrices (i.e. human red blood cells, mammalian cells).
