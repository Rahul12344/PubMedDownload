Serological tests based on the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are the primary tool for 
the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in adults and have rapidly
evolved to quicker, affordable and more accurate test formats to detect early HIV
infection. Second- and third-generation HIV rapid tests detect the immunoglobulin
G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the HIV and are used at the
point of care and in HIV self-testing. The tests are affordable and accessible in
state and private diagnostic laboratories. The present-day fourth- and
fifth-generation EIAs can detect both p24 antigen and IgG and IgM HIV antibodies 
and thereby diagnose early HIV infection at approximately 2 weeks. The fourth-
and fifth-generation EIAs also report sensitivity and specificity of more than
99%. The correct interpretation of HIV diagnosis of false-positive and
false-negative EIA test results requires collaborative scrutiny of patient
factors and laboratory test methodologies.
