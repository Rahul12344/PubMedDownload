INTRODUCTION: Drug repositioning (DR) is defined as determining new therapeutic
applications for existing drugs. This approach is advantageous over de novo drug 
discovery in accelerating clinical development, in terms of lower costs, a
shortened development period, a well-known action mechanism, a feasible dosage,
and an acceptable safety profile.
AREAS COVERED: This work was aimed at reviewing agents with successful DR in
hematology.
EXPERT OPINION: Thalidomide and plerixafor have been successfully repositioned
for treating multiple myeloma and harvesting peripheral blood stem cells,
respectively. The former was originally developed as a sedative and the latter as
an anti-HIV drug. Currently, the feasibility of repositioning various agents is
being explored (e.g. an anti-influenza virus drug oseltamivir for primary immune 
thrombocytopenia, an anti-HIV drug abacavir for adult T-cell leukemia, and a
macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for multiple myeloma). Furthermore, bosutinib
for chronic myeloid leukemia or the antiplatelet drug cilostazol have been
suggested to have clinical benefits for the management of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis and ischemic stroke, respectively. To promote DR, effective application
of artificial intelligence or stem cell models, comprehensive database
construction shared between academia and pharmaceutical companies, suitable
handling of drug patents, and wide cooperation in the area of specialty are
warranted.
