Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been evaluated as enhancers in drug
delivery, their addition in medical formulations favors drug absorption allowing 
obtaining the pharmacological effect with lower doses. In vaccine formulations
their inclusion has been also explored with interesting results. Currently
mucosal vaccination constitutes a promising alternative with the main advantage
of inducing both systemic and mucosal immune responses, which are crucial for
control tumors and infections at mucosal tissues. In the present work the nasal
immune-enhancing effect of four CPPs was evaluated in Balb/c mice. Animals were
intranasally immunized with CPP and the recombinant hepatitis B surface protein
(HBsAg) as model antigen. The antibody response in sera and mucosal tissue was
measured by ELISA. The IFN-γ secretion response at spleen was also evaluated by
ELISPOT and ELISA. Among the CPPs studied one novel peptide stand out by its
ability to potentiate the humoral and cellular immune response against the
co-administered antigen. Considering that the use of mucosal routes is a
promising strategy in vaccination, which are gaining special relevance nowadays
in the development of novel candidates against SARS-CoV-2 and other potential
emerging respiratory virus, the searching and development of safe mucosal
adjuvants constitute a current need.
