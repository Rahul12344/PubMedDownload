The potato/tomato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae) is a pest
of Solanaceae plants and a vector of the pathogenic bacterium 'Candidatus
Liberibacter solanacearum', which is associated with zebra chip disease in
potato. This disease is controlled through insecticide treatments, and more
environmentally friendly management options are desirable. The objective of this 
study was to identify viruses present in potato psyllid populations that might be
used as biocontrol agents for this insect pest. A new picorna-like virus,
tentatively named "Bactericera cockerelli picorna-like virus" (BcPLV), was
discovered in B. cockerelli populations maintained in greenhouses, through the
use of high-throughput sequencing data and subsequent confirmation by RT-PCR and 
Sanger sequencing. BcPLV has a positive-sense 9,939-nt RNA genome encoding a
single 2,947-aa polyprotein and is related to the Diaphorina citri picorna-like
virus (DcPLV) found in Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri populations. Based
on their genome organization and the phylogeny of their RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase domains, BcPLV and DcPLV together are proposed to comprise a new
genus, provisionally named "Psylloidivirus", within the family Iflaviridae.
