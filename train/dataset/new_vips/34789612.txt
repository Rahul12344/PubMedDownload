Recently, genotype VII of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has become the most
prevalent NDV genotype in Asia. Here the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene of
genotype VII NDV strains isolated in Japan was analyzed. Notably, point amino
acid substitutions in the HN protein at position 347, which is located on the
major linear epitope of the HN protein, were found in two strains. However, by a 
hemagglutination inhibition assay, major antigenic differences did not exist
between the studied strains. Additionally, chickens vaccinated with the B1 strain
did not exhibit clinical effects after challenge with variants possessing the
substitution at position 347 (E to K), whereas all unvaccinated chickens
subjected to this challenge died within 5 days.
