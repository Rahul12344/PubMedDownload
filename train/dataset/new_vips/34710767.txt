African swine fever (ASF) is an acute, hemorrhagic, and highly contact infectious
disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) infecting domestic pigs or
wild boars, the mortality rate up to 100 %. Evasion of host innate immunity plays
a vital role in the pathogenesis of ASFV. Studies have showed that the MGF505
genes involve in regulating the IFN-I response, but its mechanism of action
remains poorly understood. In our present study, ASFV MGF505-11R inhibited IFN-β 
and ISRE activation induced by cGAS, IRF7, IRF3-5D, STING, IKKε and TBK1
accompanied by decreases of IFN-β, ISG15 and ISG56 mRNA transcription. ASFV
MGF505-11R interacted with STING, degrading STING expression by the lysosomal,
ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways. Moreover, ASFV MGF505-11R could
inhibit the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3 stimulated by cGAS/STING
overexpression. Finally, the truncation mutation analysis indicated that the
1-191 aa and 182-360 aa of ASFV MGF505-11R could inhibit cGAS-STING-mediated
activation of IFN-β promoters. In short, these results demonstrated that ASFV
MGF505-11R involved in regulating the IFN-I response by negatively regulating the
cGAS signaling pathway. In summary, this study preliminarily clarified the
molecular mechanism of ASFV MGF505-11R gene antagonizing IFN-I-mediated
antiviral, which will helpfully provide new strategies for treatment and
prevention of ASF.
