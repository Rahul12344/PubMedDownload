BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is a novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic with
activity against several viruses that cause emerging infectious diseases. The
purpose of this study is to explore how commonly utilized antiretroviral therapy 
(tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine [TDF/3TC] and atazanavir/ritonavir
[ATV/r]) influence plasma and intracellular concentrations of remdesivir.
METHODS: This is an open-label, randomized, fixed sequence single intravenous
dosing study to assess pharmacokinetic interactions between remdesivir and
TDF/3TC (Study A, crossover design) or TDF/3TC plus ATV/r (Study B). Healthy
volunteers satisfying study entry criteria will be enrolled in the study and
randomized to either Study A; N=16 (Sequence 1 or Sequence 2) or Study B; N=8.
Participants will receive standard adult doses of antiretroviral therapy for 7
days and a single 200mg remdesivir infusion administered over 60 min.
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling will be performed relative to the start of
remdesivir infusion; predose (before the start of remdesivir infusion) and 30 min
after the start of remdesivir infusion. Additional blood samples will be taken at
2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after the end of remdesivir infusion.
DISCUSSION: This study will characterize the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir from 
a typical African population in whom clinical use is anticipated. Furthermore,
this study will deliver pharmacokinetic datasets for remdesivir drug
concentrations and demographic characteristics which could support pharmacometric
approaches for simulation of remdesivir treatment regimens in patients
concurrently using tenofovir/lamivudine and/or atazanavir/ritonavir.
