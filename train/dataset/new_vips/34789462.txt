Asthma is a heterogenous disease, and its prevalence and severity are different
in males versus females through various ages. As children, boys have an increased
prevalence of asthma. As adults, women have an increased prevalence and severity 
of asthma. Sex hormones, genetic and epigenetic variations, social and
environmental factors, and responses to asthma therapeutics are important factors
in the sex differences observed in asthma incidence, prevalence and severity. For
women, fluctuations in sex hormone levels during puberty, the menstrual cycle and
pregnancy are associated with asthma pathogenesis. Further, sex differences in
gene expression and epigenetic modifications and responses to environmental
factors, including SARS-CoV-2 infections, are associated with differences in
asthma incidence, prevalence and symptoms. We review the role of sex hormones,
genetics and epigenetics, and their interactions with the environment in the
clinical manifestations and therapeutic response of asthma.
