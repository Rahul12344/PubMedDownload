PURPOSE: Thorough knowledge of the nature and frequency of co-infections is
essential to optimize treatment strategies and risk assessment in cases of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening approach for community-acquired
bacterial pathogens (CABPs) at hospital admission, which could facilitate
identification of bacterial co-infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: Clinical data and biomaterials from 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients
from the observational cohort of the Competence Network for community-acquired
pneumonia (CAPNETZ) prospectively recruited between March 17, 2020, and March 12,
2021 in 12 centers in Germany and Switzerland, were included in this study.
Nasopharyngeal swab samples were analyzed on hospital admission using multiplex
real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for a broad range of CABPs.
RESULTS: In total of 200 patients Staphylococcus aureus (27.0%), Haemophilus
influenzae (13.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.5%), Moraxella catarrhalis
(2.5%), and Legionella pneumophila (1.5%) were the most frequently detected
bacterial pathogens. PCR detection of bacterial pathogens correlated with
purulent sputum, and showed no correlation with ICU admission, mortality, and
inflammation markers. Although patients who received antimicrobial treatment were
more often admitted to the ICU and had a higher mortality rate, PCR pathogen
detection was not significantly related to antimicrobial treatment.
CONCLUSION: General CABP screening using multiplex PCR with nasopharyngeal swabs 
may not facilitate prediction or identification of bacterial co-infections in the
early phase of COVID-19-related hospitalization. Most patients with positive PCR 
results appear to be colonized rather than infected at that time, questioning the
value of routine antibiotic treatment on admission in COVID-19 patients.
