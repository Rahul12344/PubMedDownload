The COVID-19 run on medical resources crashed Wuhan's medical care system, a
medical disaster duplicated in many countries facing the COVID-19 pandemic. In a 
novel approach to understanding the run on Wuhan's medical resources, we draw
from bank run theory to analyze the causes and consequences of the COVID-19 run
on Wuhan's medical resources and recommend policy changes and government actions 
to attenuate runs on medical resources in the future. Like bank runs, the cause
of the COVID-19 medical resource run was rooted in China's local medical resource
context and a sudden realignment of expectations, reflecting shortages and
misallocations of hospital resources (inadequate liquidity and portfolio
composition); high level hospitals siphoning-off patients from lower level health
providers (bank moral hazard and adverse selection problem); patients selecting
high-level hospitals over lower-level health care (depositor moral hazard
problem); inadequate government oversight and uncontrolled risky hospital
behavior (inadequate bank regulatory control); biased medical insurance schemes
(inadequate depositor insurance); and failure to provide medical resource
reserves (failure as lender of last resort). From Wuhan's COVID-19 run on medical
resources, we recommend that control and reform by government enlarge medical
resource supply, improve the capacity of primary medical care, ensure timely
virus information, formulate principles for the allocation of medical resources
that suit a country's national conditions, optimize the medical insurance schemes
and public health fund allocations and enhance the emergency support of medical
resources.
