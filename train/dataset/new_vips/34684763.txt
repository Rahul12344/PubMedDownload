Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent 
of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)) has caused relatively high mortality rates in 
humans throughout the world since its first detection in late December 2019,
leading to the most devastating pandemic of the current century. Consequently,
SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic interventions have received high priority from public
health authorities. Despite increased COVID-19 infections, a vaccine or therapy
to cover all the population is not yet available. Herein, immunoinformatics and
custommune tools were used to identify B and T-cells epitopes from the available 
SARS-CoV-2 sequences spike (S) protein. In the in silico predictions, six B cell 
epitopes QTGKIADYNYK, TEIYQASTPCNGVEG, LQSYGFQPT, IRGDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD,
FSQILPDPSKPSKRS and PFAMQMAYRFNG were cross-reacted with MHC-I and MHC-II T-cells
binding epitopes and selected for vaccination in experimental animals for
evaluation as candidate vaccine(s) due to their high antigenic matching and
conserved score. The selected six peptides were used individually or in
combinations to immunize female Balb/c mice. The immunized mice raised reactive
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in two different short peptides located in receptor
binding domain and S2 region. In combination groups, an additive effect was
demonstrated in-comparison with single peptide immunized mice. This study
provides novel epitope-based peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.
