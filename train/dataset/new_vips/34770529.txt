Contamination inspection is an ongoing concern for food distributors, restaurant 
owners, caterers, and others who handle food. Food contamination must be
prevented, and zero tolerance legal requirements and damage to the reputation of 
institutions or restaurants can be very costly. This paper introduces a new
handheld fluorescence-based imaging system that can rapidly detect, disinfect,
and document invisible organic residues and biofilms which may host pathogens.
The contamination, sanitization inspection, and disinfection (CSI-D) system uses 
light at two fluorescence excitation wavelengths, ultraviolet C (UVC) at 275 nm
and violet at 405 nm, for the detection of organic residues, including saliva and
respiratory droplets. The 275 nm light is also utilized to disinfect pathogens
commonly found within the contaminated residues. Efficacy testing of the
neutralizing effects of the ultraviolet light was conducted for Aspergillus
fumigatus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influenza A virus (a fungus, a
bacterium, and a virus, respectively, each commonly found in saliva and
respiratory droplets). After the exposure to UVC light from the CSI-D, all three 
pathogens experienced deactivation (> 99.99%) in under ten seconds. Up to
five-log reductions have also been shown within 10 s of UVC irradiation from the 
CSI-D system.
