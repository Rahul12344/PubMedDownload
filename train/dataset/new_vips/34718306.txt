Psychodynamic group psychotherapy in Daily Hospital for non-psychotic disorders
was held through Hangouts program during CoViD-19 pandemic lockdown. In our pilot
study we compared patients' impressions and their satisfaction with online
program vs. usual, in-person setting program. We analyzed the impressions of
group therapists as well. Our conclusion is that according to our patients'
impressions and satisfaction, online psychodynamic group psychotherapy is good
enough option in extreme situations such as infectious disease pandemic, although
it cannot completely replace all the aspects of usual "live" setting.
