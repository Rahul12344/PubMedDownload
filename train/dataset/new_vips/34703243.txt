pandemic which has still continued becoming a prominent headache for the whole
world. Recently, we are facing the second and third wave of multivariate
outbreaks with great intensity of transmission which renders huge disaster.
Presently, new strains of the virus are emerging that are predicted to be
resistant for the current vaccines and other management approaches. It needs
collaborative and coordinated role at professional, facility, regional, and
global levels to ameliorate the pandemic by monitoring the existing and emerging 
variants. This review addressed the multidisciplinary roles in patient screening 
and detection, emergency management, moderate and critical care, vaccination,
complication prevention, comorbidity management, psychological therapy, and
digital health care. The inevitable roles of academicians, researchers, private
health sectors, policy makers, regulatory bodies, and partners are also
discussed.
