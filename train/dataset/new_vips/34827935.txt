Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a viral disease of chickens' respiratory
system that imposes considerable financial burdens on the chicken industry.
Rapid, simple, and specific detection of this virus is crucial to enable proper
control measures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular tests require
relatively expensive instruments and skilled personnel, confining their
application to centralized laboratories. To enable chicken farms to take timely
action and contain the spread of infection, we describe a rapid, simple,
semi-quantitative benchtop isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, and a
field-deployable microfluidic device for the diagnosis of ILTV infection in
chickens. Our assay performance was compared and favorably agreed with
quantitative PCR (qPCR). The sensitivity of our real-time LAMP test is 250
genomic copies/reaction. Clinical performance of our microfluidic device using
samples from diseased chickens showed 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in
comparison with benchtop LAMP assay and the gold-standard qPCR. Our method
facilitates simple, specific, and rapid molecular ILTV detection in low-resource 
veterinary diagnostic laboratories and can be used for field molecular diagnosis 
of suspected ILT cases.
