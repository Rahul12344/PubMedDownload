Hepatitis E virus infections are the leading cause of viral hepatitis in humans, 
contributing to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases and almost 44,000
deaths annually. Recently, HEV infections have been found to result in chronic
liver infection and cirrhosis in severely immunocompromised patients, suggesting 
the possibility of HEV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. While HEV-associated
formation of HCC has rarely been reported, the expansion of HEV's clinical
spectrum and the increasing evidence of chronic HEV infections raise questions
about the connection between HEV and HCC. The present review summarizes current
clinical evidence of the relationship between HEV and HCC and discusses
mechanisms of virus-induced HCC development with regard to HEV pathogenesis. We
further elucidate why the development of HEV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma has
so rarely been observed and provide an outlook on possible experimental set-ups
to study the relationship between HEV and HCC formation.
