OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review the performance of red blood 
cell distribution width to platelet ratio (RPR) in the diagnosis of significant
or advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV).
METHODS: The relevant studies were comprehensively searched in English databases 
such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, as well as Chinese
databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data from the 
inception to March 2021. Accuracy of RPR in diagnosing significant or advanced
fibrosis and liver cirrhosis was assessed by area under the curve (AUC), pooled
sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative likelihood ratios. 
Stata 15.0 software was applied to analyze the data.
RESULTS: In total, 13 literature met the requirements, including patients with
significant fibrosis (n=1890), advanced fibrosis (n=645), and cirrhosis (n=499). 
The prevalence rates of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis
were 49.31% (range: 17.25-84.21%), 37.07% (range: 9.60-58.20%) and 2.18% (range: 
2.78-44.19%), respectively. The AUCs for predicting significant fibrosis,
advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis by RPR were 0.73 (95%CI: 0.69-0.76), 0.80
(95%CI: 0.77-0.84) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.76-0.83), respectively.
CONCLUSION: RPR is of some diagnostic value to the prediction of HBV-related
significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. This conclusion is
urgently needed to be verified by further multi-center studies of large sample
size and rigorous design.
