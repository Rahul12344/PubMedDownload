OBJECTIVE: Dynamics of humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens following 
infection suggest an initial decay of antibody followed by subsequent
stabilisation. We aim to understand the longitudinal humoral responses to
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) protein and to evaluate their
correlation to clinical symptoms among healthcare workers (HCWs).
DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal study.
SETTING: This study was conducted in a New York City public hospital in the South
Bronx, New York.
PARTICIPANTS: HCWs participated in phase 1 (N=500) and were followed up 4 months 
later in phase 2 (N=178) of the study. They underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology
testing for N and S protein antibodies, in addition to completion of an online
survey in both phases. Analysis was performed on the 178 participants who
participated in both phases of the study.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Evaluate longitudinal humoral responses to viral N
(qualitative serology testing) and S protein (quantitative Mount Sinai Health
System ELISA to detect receptor-binding domain and full-length S reactive
antibodies) by measuring rate of decay.
RESULTS: Anti-N antibody positivity was 27% and anti-S positivity was 28% in
phase 1. In phase 1, anti-S titres were higher in symptomatic (6754 (5177-8812)) 
than in asymptomatic positive subjects (5803 (2825-11 920)). Marginally higher
titres (2382 (1494-3797)) were seen in asymptomatic compared with the symptomatic
positive subgroup (2198 (1753-2755)) in phase 2. A positive correlation was noted
between age (R=0.269, p<0.01), number (R=0.310, p<0.01) and duration of symptoms 
(R=0.434, p<0.01), and phase 1 anti-S antibody titre. A strong correlation
(R=0.898, p<0.001) was observed between phase 1 titres and decay of anti-S
antibody titres between the two phases. Significant correlation with rate of
decay was also noted with fever (R=0.428, p<0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms
(R=0.340, p<0.05), and total number (R=0.357, p<0.01) and duration of COVID-19
symptoms (R=0.469, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher initial anti-S antibody titres were associated with larger
number and longer duration of symptoms as well as a faster decay between the two 
time points.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interests: FK is listed as a
co-inventor on a patent application filed by the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2
vaccines. Mount Sinai has spun out a company, Kantaro, to market serological
tests for SARS-CoV-2. FK has consulted for Merck and Pfizer (before 2020), and is
currently consulting for Seqirus and Avimex. FK’s Krammer laboratory is also
collaborating with Pfizer on animal models of SARS-CoV-2.
