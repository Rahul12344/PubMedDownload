OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the performance, before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic, of the case definition of suspected influenza used in
community surveillance in Mexico.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study was performed and cases
that met the suspected case criteria (n = 20,511) and that had
laboratory-conclusive evidence (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction)
to confirm or discard influenza virus infection were analysed.
RESULTS: A high sensitivity and modest specificity were documented, which later
decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as its diagnostic accuracy.
However, no significant differences were observed in the area under the receiver 
operating characteristics curve among the analysed periods.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated case definition remains to be a cost-effective
alternative for identifying patients who may benefit from influenza-specific
antiviral drugs, even during the global COVID-19 outbreak.
