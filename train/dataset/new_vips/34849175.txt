The Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made a remarkable impact on
economies and societies worldwide. With numerous procedures of social distancing 
and lockdowns, it becomes essential to know people's emotional responses on a
very large scale. Thus, an effective emotion classification approach is developed
using the proposed Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk-Water Sailfish-based 
Hierarchical Attention Network (CAViaR-WS-based HAN) for classifying the emotions
in the COVID-19 text review data. The proposed approach, named CAViaR-WS, is
designed by the incorporation of Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk-Sail
Fish (CAViaR-SF) and Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA). Here, the significant features,
such as mean, variance, entropy, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF), SentiWordNet features, and spam word-based features, are extracted to
further processing. Based on the extracted features, feature fusion is
accomplished using the RideNN. In addition, CAViaR-SF-based GAN is used to
perform the spam classification, and then, the emotion classification is carried 
out using Hierarchal Attention Networks (HAN), where the training procedure of
HAN is performed using proposed CAViaR-WS. Furthermore, the developed
CAViaR-WS-based HAN offers effective performance results concerning precision,
recall, and f-measure with the maximal values of 0.937, 0.958, and 0.948,
respectively.
