Ideally, a vaccine should provide life-long protection following a single
administered dose. In our previous study, the immunopotentiator CVC1302, which
contains pattern- recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, was demonstrated to
prolong the lifetime of the humoral immune response induced by killed
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) vaccine. To elucidate the mechanism by which 
CVC1302 induces long-term humoral immunity, we used 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl
(NP)-OVA as a pattern antigen and administered it to mice along with CVC1302,
emulsified together with Marcol 52 mineral oil (NP-CVC1302). From the results of 
NP-specific antibody levels, we found that CVC1302 could induce not only higher
levels of NP-specific antibodies but also high-affinity NP-specific antibody
levels. To detect the resulting NP-specific immune cells, samples were taken from
the injection sites, draining lymph nodes (LNs), and bone marrow of mice injected
with NP-CVC1302. The results of these experiments show that, compared with mice
injected with NP alone, those injected with NP-CVC1302 had higher percentages of 
NP+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the injection sites and draining LNs,
higher percentages of follicular helper T cells (TFH), germinal center (GC) B
cells, and NP+ plasma-blasts in the draining LNs, as well as higher percentages
of NP+ long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) in the bone marrow. Additionally, we
observed that the inclusion of CVC1302 in the immunization prolonged the lifetime
of LLPCs in the bone marrow by improving the transcription expression of
anti-apoptotic transcription factors such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2, BAFF, BCMA, Bax, and
IRF-4. This research provides a blueprint for designing new generations of
immunopotentiators.
