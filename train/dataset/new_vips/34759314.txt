Pathogens use virulence factors to inhibit the immune system1. The guard
hypothesis2,3 postulates that hosts monitor (or 'guard') critical innate immune
pathways such that their disruption by virulence factors provokes a secondary
immune response1. Here we describe a 'self-guarded' immune pathway in human
monocytes, in which guarding and guarded functions are combined in one protein.
We find that this pathway is triggered by ICP0, a key virulence factor of herpes 
simplex virus type 1, resulting in robust induction of anti-viral type I
interferon (IFN). Notably, induction of IFN by ICP0 is independent of canonical
immune pathways and the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors. A CRISPR screen
identified the ICP0 target MORC34 as an essential negative regulator of IFN. Loss
of MORC3 recapitulates the IRF3- and IRF7-independent IFN response induced by
ICP0. Mechanistically, ICP0 degrades MORC3, which leads to de-repression of a
MORC3-regulated DNA element (MRE) adjacent to the IFNB1 locus. The MRE is
required in cis for IFNB1 induction by the MORC3 pathway, but is not required for
canonical IFN-inducing pathways. As well as repressing the MRE to regulate IFNB1,
MORC3 is also a direct restriction factor of HSV-15. Our results thus suggest a
model in which the primary anti-viral function of MORC3 is self-guarded by its
secondary IFN-repressing function-thus, a virus that degrades MORC3 to avoid its 
primary anti-viral function will unleash the secondary anti-viral IFN response.
