The host response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is highly
heterogeneous, ranging from mild/asymptomatic to severe. The moderate to severe
forms of COVID-19 often require hospitalization, are associated with a high rate 
of mortality, and appear to be caused by an inappropriately exaggerated
inflammatory response to the virus. Emerging data confirm the involvement of both
innate and adaptive immune pathways both in protection from SARS-CoV-2, and in
driving the pathology of severe COVID-19. In particular, innate immune cells
including neutrophils appear to be key players in the inflammation that causes
the vicious cycle of damage and inflammation that underlies the symptomatology of
severe COVID-19. Several recent studies support a link between damage and
inflammation, with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) playing a key
role in the pathology of severe COVID-19. In this review, we put into perspective
the role of DAMPs and of components of the DAMP-signaling cascade, including
Siglecs and their cognate ligands CD24 and CD52, in COVID-19. Further, we review 
clinical data on proposed therapeutics targeting DAMP pathways to treat
SARS-CoV-2 infection and the regulation of these signaling cascades in COVID-19. 
We also discuss the potential impact of DAMP-mediated inflammation in other
indications related to COVID-19, such as ARDS, endothelial dysfunction,
hypercoagulation, and sepsis.
