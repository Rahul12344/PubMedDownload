INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This article reports the results of the 2020 Spanish
Catheter Ablation Registry, a year marked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively through completion and return of a
specific form by the participating centers.
RESULTS: Data from 97 centers (67 public, 30 private) were analyzed. A total of
15 169 ablation procedures were reported with a mean of 155±117 and a median
[interquartile range] of 115 [62-227]. Because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, both
procedures and participating centers markedly decreased (-3380 procedures,-18%)
and there were 5 centers less than in 2019. The most common procedure continued
to be atrial fibrillation ablation (4513; 30%), well ahead of the remaining
substrates, followed by ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (3188; 21%), and
intranodal re-entry tachycardia (2808; 18%). Ablation of these 3 substrates
continued to form the bulk of the procedures. The total success rate was slightly
lower than in previous years (88%) with a similar complication rate (n=309; 2%)
and mortality (n=7; 0.04%). A total of 243 procedures were performed in pediatric
patients (1.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish Catheter Ablation Registry systematically and
continuously reflects the national trajectory, which, in 2020, was markedly
affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Although slightly lower than in previous
years, the success rate remained high, with a low complication rate.
