OBJECTIVE: Identify users, services, and reasons for seeking online mental health
care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study, with documentary analysis of medical
records of users served between April and July 2020.
RESULTS: Of the 258 accesses, 159 were complete, and 99 were offline messages.
Although there were 61 (38.36%) consultations in May, in April, there were 49
(30.82%) in 18 days of reception. More than 89% of accesses were women between 40
and 59 years. Among the motivations in the search for care, anxiety, fear,
depression, sadness, crying, stress, and suicidal ideation stand out.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Chat is a quick, early and short-wait intervention
opportunity for people in need of mental health care. Therefore, the study
emphasizes the importance of investing in the training of nursing professionals
to act in mental health.
