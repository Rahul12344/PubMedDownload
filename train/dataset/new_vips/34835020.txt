Nanobodies are 130 amino acid single-domain antibodies (VHH) derived from the
unique heavy-chain-only subclass of Camelid immunogloblins. Their small molecular
size, facile expression, high affinity and stability have combined to make them
unique targeting reagents with numerous applications in the biomedical sciences. 
The first nanobody agent has now entered the clinic as a treatment against a
blood disorder. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has seen the global scientific
endeavour work to accelerate the development of technologies to try to defeat a
pandemic that has now killed over four million people. In a remarkably short
period of time, multiple studies have reported nanobodies directed against the
viral Spike protein. Several agents have been tested in culture and demonstrate
potent neutralisation of the virus or pseudovirus. A few agents have completed
animal trials with very encouraging results showing their potential for treating 
infection. Here, we discuss the structural features that guide the nanobody
recognition of the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
