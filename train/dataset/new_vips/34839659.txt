Membrane fusion is one of the most important processes for the survival of
eukaryotic cells and entry of enveloped viruses to the host cells. Lipid
composition plays a crucial role in the process by modulating the organization
and dynamics of the membrane, as well as the structure and conformation of
membrane proteins. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a lipid molecule with intrinsic
negative curvature, promotes membrane fusion by stabilizing the non-lamellar
intermediate structures in the fusion process. Conversely, oleic acid (OA), with 
intrinsic positive curvature, inhibits membrane fusion. The current study aimed
to investigate polyethylene glycol-mediated lipid mixing, content mixing, content
leakage, and depth-dependent membrane organization and dynamics, using arrays of 
steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques, to determine the
causative role of PE and OA in membrane fusion. The results demonstrated that the
presence of 30 mol % PE in the membrane promotes membrane fusion through a
mechanism that circumvents the classical stalk model. On the contrary, membranes 
containing OA showed reduced rate and extent of fusion, despite following the
same mechanism. Collectively, our findings in terms of membrane organization and 
dynamics indicated a plausible role of PE and OA in membrane fusion.
