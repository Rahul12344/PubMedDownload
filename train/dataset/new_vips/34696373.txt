The recently discovered porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) belongs to the Circovirus
genus of the Circoviridae family together with the other three PCVs, PCV1, PCV2, 
and PCV4. As reported, PCV3 can infect pig, wild boar, and several other
intermediate hosts, resulting in single or multiple infections in the affected
animal. The PCV3 infection can lead to respiratory diseases, digestive disorders,
reproductive disorders, multisystemic inflammation, and immune responses. Up to
now, PCV3 infection, as well as the disease caused by PCV3, has been reported in 
many swine farms worldwide with high positive rates, which indicates that the
virus may be another important pathogen in the swine industry. Therefore, we
reviewed the current progress on epidemiology and pathobiology of PCV3, which may
provide the latest knowledge of the virus and PCV3-related diseases.
