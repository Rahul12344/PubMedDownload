We present an integrated analysis of urine and serum proteomics and clinical
measurements in asymptomatic, mild/moderate, severe and convalescent cases of
COVID-19. We identify the pattern of immune response during COVID-19 infection.
The immune response is activated in asymptomatic infection, but is dysregulated
in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Our data suggest that the turning point
depends on the function of myeloid cells and neutrophils. In addition, immune
defects persist into the recovery stage, until 12 months after diagnosis.
Moreover, disorders of cholesterol metabolism span the entire progression of the 
disease, starting from asymptomatic infection and lasting to recovery. Our data
suggest that prolonged dysregulation of the immune response and cholesterol
metabolism might be the pivotal causative agent of other potential sequelae. Our 
study provides a comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis,
which is instructive for the development of early intervention strategies to
ameliorate complex disease sequelae.
