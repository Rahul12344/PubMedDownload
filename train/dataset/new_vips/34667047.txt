We describe the case of a 45-year-old man affected by T-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia and diagnosed with COVID-19 early after an allogeneic haematopoietic
stem cell transplant. The infectious disease was characterised by a severe and
prolonged course, further complicated by a spontaneous pneumomediastinum and
pneumopericardium. We successfully treated this patient with the antiviral drug
remdesivir associated with two courses of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. This case
report represents a good example of the typical clinical course of COVID-19 in
severely immunosuppressed patients and gives evidence that in this population
only a prompt treatment directed towards viral clearance can face the absence of 
a valid immune reactivity.
