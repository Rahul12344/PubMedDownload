BACKGROUND: During laparoscopy, the abdominal cavity is insufflated with carbon
dioxide (CO2) that could become contaminated with viruses and surgical smoke.
Medical staff is potentially exposed when this gas leaks into the operating room 
through the instruments and past trocar valves. No detailed studies currently
exist that have quantified these leakage pathways. Therefore, the goal of this
study was to quantify the gas leakages through trocars and instruments, during
minimally invasive procedures.
METHODS: A model of the surgical environment was created, consisting of a rigid
container with an interface for airtight clamping of laparoscopic equipment such 
as trocars and surgical instruments. The model was insufflated to 15 mm Hg using 
a pressure generator and a pneumotachograph measured the equipment gas leak. A
protocol of several use cases was designed to simulate the motions and forces the
surgeon exerts on the trocar during surgery.
RESULTS: Twenty-three individual trocars and twenty-six laparoscopic instruments 
were measured for leakage under the different conditions of the protocol. Trocar 
leakages varied between 0 L/min and more than 30 L/min, the instruments revealed 
a range of leakages between 0 L/min and 5.5 L/min. The results showed that
leakage performance varied widely between trocars and instruments and that the
performance and location of the valves influenced trocar leakage.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose trocar redesigns to overcome specific causes of gas
leaks. Moreover, an international testing standard for CO2 leakage for all new
trocars and instruments is needed so surgical teams can avoid this potential
health hazard when selecting new equipment.
