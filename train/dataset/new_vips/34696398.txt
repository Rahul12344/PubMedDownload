Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a highly conserved pathway related to a variety of
biological processes in different cells. The regulation of replication of various
viruses by Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been reported. However, the
interaction between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and avian leukosis virus is
unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of modulating the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway during avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection.
The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by GSK-3 inhibitor increased ALV-J
mRNA, viral protein expression, and virus production in CEF cells. This increase 
was suppressed by iCRT14, one of the specific inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway. Moreover, treatment with iCRT14 reduced virus titer and viral 
gene expression significantly in CEF and LMH cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Inhibition Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by knockdown of β-catenin reduced
virus proliferation in CEF cells also. Collectively, these results suggested that
the status of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway modulated ALV-J replication. These 
studies extend our understanding of the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
in ALV-J replication and make a new contribution to understanding the virus-host 
interactions of avian leukosis virus.
