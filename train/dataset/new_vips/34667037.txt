A 79-year-old woman presented with a week-long history of shortness of breath.
She had a background of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) which was stable and 
had not required any antifibrotic treatment. A month prior to this presentation, 
she was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia, with maximal oxygen requirement of 2 L,
but was discharged without need for supplemental oxygen. On readmission, she was 
found to have severe, rapidly progressive pulmonary fibrosis. After all
precipitating causes were ruled out, it was felt her recent COVID-19 infection
was the exacerbating factor causing progression of pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19
infection has been hypothesised to cause long term pulmonary fibrosis, but this
is the first case highlighting COVID-19 infection as the causative agent
exacerbating IPF.
