INTRODUCTION: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest provider of 
HIV care in the United States. Changes in healthcare delivery became necessary
with the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared HIV healthcare delivery during the first 
year of the COVID-19 pandemic to a prior similar calendar period.
METHODS: We included 27,674 people with HIV (PWH) enrolled in the Veterans Aging 
Cohort Study prior to 1 March 2019, with ≥1 healthcare encounter from 1 March
2019 to 29 February 2020 (2019) and/or 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 (2020).
We counted monthly general medicine/infectious disease (GM/ID) clinic visits and 
HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) tests. We determined the percentage with ≥1 clinic
visit (in-person vs. telephone/video [virtual]) and ≥1 VL test (detectable vs.
suppressed) for 2019 and 2020. Using pharmacy records, we summarized
antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill length (<90 vs. ≥90 days) and monthly ARV 
coverage.
RESULTS: Most patients had ≥1 GM/ID visit in 2019 (96%) and 2020 (95%). For 2019,
27% of visits were virtual compared to 64% in 2020. In 2019, 82% had VL measured 
compared to 74% in 2020. Of those with VL measured, 92% and 91% had suppressed VL
in 2019 and 2020. ARV refills for ≥90 days increased from 39% in 2019 to 51% in
2020. ARV coverage was similar for all months of 2019 and 2020 ranging from 76%
to 80% except for March 2019 (72%). Women were less likely than men to be on ARVs
or to have a VL test in both years.
CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the VA increased the use of virtual
visits and longer ARV refills, while maintaining a high percentage of patients
with suppressed VL among those with VL measured. Despite decreased in-person
services during the pandemic, access to ARVs was not disrupted. More follow-up
time is needed to determine whether overall health was impacted by the use of
differentiated service delivery and to evaluate whether a long-term shift to
increased virtual healthcare could be beneficial, particularly for PWH in rural
areas or with transportation barriers. Programmes to increase ARV use and VL
testing for women are needed.
