OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of mental distress among university
students in Jordan.
METHODS: An online cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire 
was conducted between 12th of June and the 4th of August 2021 in Jordan to
measure student mental stress using Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20).
RESULTS: A total of 1063 university students participated in the study. One-third
of the participating students reported that they had a history of COVID-19
infection. More than half of the participating university students (65.7%) were
found to have mental distress (measured symptomatically by the SRQ-20 with a
score of eight or more). The average mental distress score was 9.8 (SD: 5.5) out 
of 20. Female students, students from non-medical colleges, students in their
last years of study, students with chronic diseases and those with low income
were associated with high levels of mental distress (p < 0.05). With regards to
social support, a moderate level of social support was received from three
sources: persons considered as significant others, family members, and friends.
The average social support score for the participating university students was
41.9 (SD: 10.3) out of 60 (equivalent to 69.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mental distress is prevalent among university students in Jordan.
There is a need for evidence-based governmental strategies and interventions that
provide social support at universities such as self-help measures and
professional mental health services as part of student health services that would
be helpful to reduce the burden of mental distress of students and promote the
mission of the integration of mental health in all university policies.
