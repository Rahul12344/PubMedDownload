The detailed mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the initiation
and progression of EBV-associated malignancies are not yet completely understood.
During the last years, new insights into the mechanisms of malignant
transformation of EBV-infected cells including somatic mutations and epigenetic
modifications, their impact on the microenvironment and resulting unique immune
signatures related to immune system functional status and immune escape
strategies have been reported. In this context, there exists increasing evidence 
that EBV-infected tumor cells can influence the tumor microenvironment to their
own benefit by establishing an immune-suppressive surrounding. The identified
mechanisms include EBV gene integration and latent expression of
EBV-infection-triggered cytokines by tumor and/or bystander cells, e.g.,
cancer-associated fibroblasts with effects on the composition and spatial
distribution of the immune cell subpopulations next to the infected cells, stroma
constituents and extracellular vesicles. This review summarizes (i) the typical
stages of the viral life cycle and EBV-associated transformation, (ii) strategies
to detect EBV genome and activity and to differentiate various latency types,
(iii) the role of the tumor microenvironment in EBV-associated malignancies, (iv)
the different immune escape mechanisms and (v) their clinical relevance. This
gained information will enhance the development of therapies against EBV-mediated
diseases to improve patient outcome.
