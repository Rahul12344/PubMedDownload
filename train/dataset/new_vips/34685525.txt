The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is related to enhanced production of
NETs, and autoimmune/autoinflammatory phenomena. We evaluated the proportion of
low-density granulocytes (LDG) by flow cytometry, and their capacity to produce
NETs was compared with that of conventional neutrophils. NETs and their protein
cargo were quantified by confocal microscopy and ELISA. Antinuclear antibodies
(ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and the degradation capacity
of NETs were addressed in serum. MILLIPLEX assay was used to assess the cytokine 
levels in macrophages' supernatant and serum. We found a higher proportion of LDG
in severe and critical COVID-19 which correlated with severity and inflammatory
markers. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients had higher plasmatic NE, LL-37 and
HMGB1-DNA complexes, whilst ISG-15-DNA complexes were lower in severe patients.
Sera from severe/critical COVID-19 patients had lower degradation capacity of
NETs, which was reverted after adding hrDNase. Anti-NET antibodies were found in 
COVID-19, which correlated with ANA and ANCA positivity. NET stimuli enhanced the
secretion of cytokines in macrophages. This study unveils the role of COVID-19
NETs as inducers of pro-inflammatory and autoimmune responses. The deficient
degradation capacity of NETs may contribute to the accumulation of these
structures and anti-NET antibodies are related to the presence of autoantibodies.
