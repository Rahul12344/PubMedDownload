Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a scientific and social
crisis. One of the main unmet needs for coronavirus disease 2019 is its
unpredictable clinical course, which can rapidly change in an irreversible
outcome. COVID-19 patients can be classified into mild, moderate, and severe.
Several haematological parameters, such as platelets, white blood cell total
count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, (together with neutrophil-lymphocyte and
platelet-lymphocyte ratio), and haemoglobin were described to be associated with 
COVID-19 infection and severity. The purpose of these review is to describe the
current state of the art about complete blood count alterations during COVID-19
infection, and to summarize the crucial role of some haematological parameters
during the course of the disease. Decreased platelet, lymphocyte, haemoglobin,
eosinophil, and basophil count, increased neutrophil count and
neutrophil-lymphocyte and platelet-lymphocyte ratio have been associated with
COVID-19 infection and a worse clinical outcome. Our study adds some novelty
about the identification of effective biomarkers of progressive disease, and
might be helpful for diagnosis, prevention of complications, and effective
therapy.
