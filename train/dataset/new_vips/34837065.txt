Advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy have stimulated renewed interest in
adenoviruses as oncolytic agents. Clinical experience has shown that oncolytic
adenoviruses are safe and well tolerated but possess modest single-agent
activity. One approach to improve the potency of oncolytic viruses is to utilise 
their tumour selectivity to deliver genes encoding prodrug-activating enzymes.
These enzymes can convert prodrugs into cytotoxic species within the tumour;
however, these cytotoxins can interfere with viral replication and limit utility.
In this work, we evaluated the activity of a nitroreductase (NTR)-armed oncolytic
adenovirus ONYX-411NTR in combination with the clinically tested bioreductive
prodrug PR-104. Both NTR-expressing cells in vitro and xenografts containing a
minor population of NTR-expressing cells were highly sensitive to PR-104.
Pharmacologically relevant prodrug exposures did not interfere with ONYX-411NTR
replication in vitro. In vivo, prodrug administration increased virus titre and
improved virus distribution within tumour xenografts. Colonisation of tumours
with high ONYX-411NTR titre resulted in NTR expression and prodrug activation.
The combination of ONYX-411NTR with PR-104 was efficacious against HCT116
xenografts, whilst neither prodrug nor virus were active as single agents. This
work highlights the potential for future clinical development of NTR-armed
oncolytic viruses in combination with bioreductive prodrugs.
