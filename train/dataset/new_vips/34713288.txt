BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations
(ACCHOs) provide culturally appropriate medical services to Aboriginal and/or
Torres Strait Islander people. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of
telehealth on patient attendance and revenue within an ACCHO during COVID-19.
METHOD: This is a time-series study of general practitioner attendances at a
regional Victorian ACCHO in two periods: March-June 2019 (pre-COVID-19)
and March-June 2020 (during COVID-19).
RESULTS: After adjusting for the number of available appointments, there was a
27% increased rate of attendances per appointment slot during the COVID-19 period
when compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, and a 59% increase in Medicare
Benefits Schedule items claimed during the COVID-19 period, compared with the
pre-COVID-19 period.
DISCUSSION: The findings indicate that the provision of services via telehealth
increased the number of people able to access the medical clinic, and that this
had a positive financial impact for the organisation.
