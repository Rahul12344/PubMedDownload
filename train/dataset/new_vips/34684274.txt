Arbovirus infections are widespread, and their disease burden has increased in
the past decade. In Africa, arbovirus infections and fever with unknown etiology 
are common. Due to the lack of well-established epidemiologic surveillance
systems and accurate differential diagnosis in most African countries, little is 
known about the prevalence of human arbovirus infections in Africa. The aim of
this review is to summarize the available epidemiological data and diagnostic
laboratory tools of infections with dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya
viruses, all transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Studies indicate that these
arboviral infections are endemic in most of Africa. Surveillance of the incidence
and prevalence of the infections would enable medical doctors to improve the
diagnostic accuracy in patients with typical symptoms. If possible, arboviral
diagnostic tests should be added to the routine healthcare systems. Healthcare
providers should be informed about the prevalent arboviral diseases to identify
possible cases.
