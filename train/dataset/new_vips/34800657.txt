Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
has become a popular technique to assess gene expression. Suitable reference
genes are normally identified first to ensure accurate normalization. The aim of 
the present study was to select the most stable genes in embryonic developmental 
stages, the early development of immune organs, and cells infected with Chinese
rice-field eel rhabdovirus (CrERV) of the rice-field eel (Monopterus albus). Four
reference genes, including those encoding 18S ribosomal RNA (18SrRNA), beta actin
(β-actin), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1ɑ), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were assessed using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and
RefFinder software. Analyses indicated the stability ranking was 18SrRNA >
β-actin > GAPDH > EF1α in the embryonic stage, with 18SrRNA as the most stable
reference gene. For immunity-related organs at different developmental stages,
the order in the thymus was β-actin > GAPDH > EF1α > 18SrRNA, with β-actin as the
most stable gene. In both spleen and kidney tissues, the rank order was
EF1ɑ > GAPDH > β-actin > 18SrRNA, with EF1α as the most stable gene. Furthermore,
in rice-field eel kidney (CrE-K) cells infected with CrERV, the ranking was
EF1ɑ > β-actin > GAPDH > 18SrRNA, with EF1α as the most stable gene. The results 
for cells infected with CrERV were verified by testing signaling pathway genes
catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) and NOTCH1 based on the above four genes after virus
infection in CrE-K cells. This study laid the foundation for choosing suitable
reference genes for immunity-related gene expression analysis in rice-field eel.
