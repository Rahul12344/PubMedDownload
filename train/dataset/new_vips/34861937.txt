Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic, partially double-stranded DNA virus
that replicates by reverse transcription and is a major cause of chronic liver
disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Reverse transcription is catalyzed by the
four-domain multifunctional HBV polymerase (P) protein that has protein-priming, 
RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis (i.e., reverse transcriptase), and
ribonuclease H activities. P also likely promotes the three strand transfers that
occur during reverse transcription, and it may participate in immune evasion by
HBV. Reverse transcription is primed by a tyrosine residue in the amino-terminal 
domain of P, and P remains covalently attached to the product DNA throughout
reverse transcription. The reverse transcriptase activity of P is the target for 
the nucleos(t)ide analog drugs that dominate HBV treatment, and P is the target
of ongoing efforts to develop new drugs against both the reverse transcriptase
and ribonuclease H activities. Despite the unusual reverse transcription pathway 
catalyzed by P and the importance of P to HBV therapy, understanding the
enzymology and structure of HBV P severely lags that of the retroviral reverse
transcriptases due to substantial technical challenges to studying the enzyme.
Obtaining a better understanding of P will broaden our appreciation of the
diversity among reverse transcribing elements in nature, and will help improve
treatment for people chronically infected with HBV.
