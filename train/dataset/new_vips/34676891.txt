Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into
eight fundamental clades with four of these clades (G, GH, GR, and GV) globally
prevalent in 2020. To explain plausible epistatic effects of the signature
co-occurring mutations of these circulating clades on viral replication and
transmission fitness, we proposed a hypothetical model using in silico approach. 
Molecular docking and dynamics analyses showed the higher infectiousness of a
spike mutant through more favorable binding of G614 with the elastase-2. RdRp
mutation p.P323L significantly increased genome-wide mutations (p < 0.0001),
allowing for more flexible RdRp (mutated)-NSP8 interaction that may accelerate
replication. Superior RNA stability and structural variation at NSP3:C241T might 
impact protein, RNA interactions, or both. Another silent 5'-UTR:C241T mutation
might affect translational efficiency and viral packaging. These four
G-clade-featured co-occurring mutations might increase viral replication.
Sentinel GH-clade ORF3a:p.Q57H variants constricted the ion-channel through
intertransmembrane-domain interaction of cysteine(C81)-histidine(H57). The
GR-clade N:p.RG203-204KR would stabilize RNA interaction by a more flexible and
hypo-phosphorylated SR-rich region. GV-clade viruses seemingly gained the
evolutionary advantage of the confounding factors; nevertheless, N:p.A220V might 
modulate RNA binding with no phenotypic effect. Our hypothetical model needs
further retrospective and prospective studies to understand detailed molecular
events and their relationship to the fitness of SARS-CoV-2.
