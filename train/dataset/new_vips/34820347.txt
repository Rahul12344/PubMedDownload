Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its associated
precautionary measures have substantial impacts not only on the medical,
economic, and social context but also on psychological health. This study aimed
to assess the obsession toward COVID-19 preventive measures among undergraduate
medical students during the early phase of the pandemic in Jordan. Methods:
Online questionnaires were distributed between March 16, 2020 and March 19, 2020.
Socio-demographic characteristics were collected, and self-reported obsession
toward COVID-19 preventive measures was assessed using a single question.COVID-19
knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary measures were evaluated using
scales. Using the chi-square test, Student t-test, and one-way ANOVA, we assessed
the differences in the obsession of students with socio-demographic
characteristics and scores of the scales. Results: A total of 1,404 participants 
(60% were female participants) completed the survey with a participation rate of 
15.6%. Obsession with preventive measures was reported by 6.8%. Obsession was
significantly more common among women (9.2%) than men (3.3%) and students who
attended COVID-19 lectures (9.5%) than those who did not attend such lectures
(5.8%) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Obsessed participants reported
significantly higher levels of COVID-19 knowledge (p = 0.012) and precautionary
measures (p < 0.001). COVID-19 risk perception had a mild effect size difference 
but with no statistical significance (p = 0.075). There were no significant
differences in the academic levels of participants (p = 0.791) and universities
(p = 0.807) between students who were obsessed and those who were not.
Conclusions: Obsession is one of the significant but unspoken psychological
effects of COVID-19 precautionary measures among undergraduate medical students. 
Medical schools should be equipped with means to handle pandemic psychological
effects.
