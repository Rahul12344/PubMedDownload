Allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) is the major thiol-reactive organosulfur compound
produced by garlic plants (Allium sativum) upon tissue damage. Allicin exerts its
strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi via S-thioallylation of 
protein thiols and low molecular weight thiols. Here, we investigated the effect 
of allicin on SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. Toxicity tests
revealed that Calu-3 cells showed greater allicin tolerance, probably due to
>4-fold higher GSH levels compared to the very sensitive Vero E6 cells. Exposure 
of infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells to biocompatible allicin doses led to a
∼60-70% decrease of viral RNA and infectious viral particles. Label-free
quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the changes in the Calu-3
proteome after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the effect of allicin on the host-virus
proteome. SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells caused a strong induction of the
antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature, including several antiviral
effectors, such as cGAS, Mx1, IFIT, IFIH, IFI16, IFI44, OAS, and ISG15, pathways 
of vesicular transport, tight junctions (KIF5A/B/C, OSBPL2, CLTCL1, and ARHGAP17)
and ubiquitin modification (UBE2L3/5), as well as reprogramming of host
metabolism, transcription and translation. Allicin treatment of infected Calu-3
cells reduced the expression of IFN signaling pathways and ISG effectors and
reverted several host pathways to levels of uninfected cells. Allicin further
reduced the abundance of the structural viral proteins N, M, S and ORF3 in the
host-virus proteome. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the antiviral and
immunomodulatory activity of biocompatible doses of allicin in
SARS-CoV-2-infected cell cultures. Future drug research should be directed to
exploit the thiol-reactivity of allicin derivatives with increased stability and 
lower human cell toxicity as antiviral lead compounds.
