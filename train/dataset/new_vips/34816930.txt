OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the fear of COVID-19 through the opinions
of individuals under the age of 18 on the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccination.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 290 high school students
studying in a central district between February 15, 2021, and March 1, 2021. The 
questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics
of the students and COVID-19 infection and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale.
RESULTS: The age of the participants ranged from 14-18; 76.9% of the study group 
consisted of female students; and 76.9% of the participants declared that they
live in middleincome households. Participants reported that they lived in the
same house with at least 2 and a maximum of 12 people; 9.7% of the participants
reported that they had a COVID-19 infection; 62.4% of the participants reported
that they want to get the COVID-19 vaccine; and 55.2% of the participants
reported that the COVID-19 vaccine will reduce the transmission. The mean
obtained from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale is 3.38±4.75 in the whole group. It was 
determined that there was a significant difference between genders, the effect of
the vaccine on the incidence, the status of having a COVID-19 infection, and the 
score of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale.
CONCLUSION: The attitudes of young individuals, who are one of the vulnerable
groups during pandemic periods, toward vaccination are important in terms of
infecting those they come into contact with and increasing the rate of infection.
