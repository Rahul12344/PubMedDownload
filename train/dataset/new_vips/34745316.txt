Aim: The severity of COVID-19 has raised a great public health concern evoking an
urgency for developing multitargeted therapeutics. Phlomis species was
ethno-pharmacologically practiced for respiratory ailments. Materials & methods: 
An array of 15 phytoligands previously isolated from Phlomis aurea were subjected
to molecular docking to explore their potential
SARS-CoV-Spike-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 complex inhibition, that is
essential for virus entry to host cell. Results: Acteoside (11) showed the most
potent in silico inhibition with an additional merit, over hesperidin (16), of
not binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with well proven in vivo pulmonary
protective role in acute lung injury, followed by
chrysoeriol-7-O-β-glucopyranoside (12) and luteolin-7-O-β-glucopyranoside (14).
Conclusion: Phytoligands (11, 12 and 14) were posed as promising candidates with 
potential prophylactic action against COVID-19. These phytoligands were
prioritized for further biological experimentation because of their acceptable
predicted ADME and drug-likeness parameters. Moreover, they could aid in
developing multitargeted strategy for better management of COVID-19 using
phytomedicines.
