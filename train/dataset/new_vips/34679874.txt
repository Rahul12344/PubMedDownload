This study reports the first equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and equine
herpesvirus-4 (EHV-4) seroprevalence investigation in horse populations of
Morocco in 24 years. It also aims to determine antibody titers in horses
vaccinated under field conditions with a monovalent EHV-1 vaccine. Blood samples 
were collected from 405 horses, including 163 unvaccinated and 242 vaccinated
animals. They were tested using a commercial type-specific enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a virus neutralization test (VNT). Overall, 12.8%
unvaccinated, and 21.8% vaccinated horses were positive for EHV-1. All samples
were positive for EHV-4 when tested with the type-specific ELISA. In the
vaccinated group, the VNT revealed a mean antibody titer of 1:49 for EHV-1 and
1:45 for EHV-4. The present study demonstrates that EHV-1 and EHV-4 are endemic
in the horse populations in the north of Morocco, with prevalence differences
between regions. Furthermore, horses vaccinated with a monovalent EHV-1 vaccine
had low antibodies titers. This study highlights the necessity to establish
and/or support efficient biosecurity strategies based on sound management of
horses and characterize further and potentially improve the efficiency of the EHV
vaccines and vaccination protocol used in the field.
