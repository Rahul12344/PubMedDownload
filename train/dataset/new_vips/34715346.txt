OBJECTIVE: The dynamic adaptive immune responses elicited by the inactivated
virus vaccine CoronaVac remain elusive.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 100 healthcare professionals naïve for severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who received two doses of
CoronaVac, we analysed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular responses at four
different timepoints, including before vaccination (T1), 2 weeks after the first 
dose (T2), 2 weeks after the booster dose (T3), and 8-10 weeks after the booster 
dose (T4). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, serum neutralizing activities,
peripheral B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and their memory subsets were
simultaneously measured in this cohort.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG responses reached a peak (geometric mean
titre (GMT) 54827, 30969-97065) after two doses and rapidly declined (GMT 502,
212-1190) at T4, whereas suboptimal IgA responses were detected (GMT 5, 2-9).
Spike-specific circulating B cells (0.60%, 0.46-0.73% of total B cells) and
memory B cells (1.18%, 0.92-1.44% of total memory B cells) were effectively
induced at T3 and sustained over time (0.33%, 0.23-0.43%; 0.87%, 0.05-1.67%,
respectively). SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating CD4+ T cells (0.57%, 0.47-0.66%)
and CD8+ T cells (1.29%, 1.04-1.54%) were detected at T3. At T4, 0.78%
(0.43-1.20%) of memory CD4+ T cells and 0.68% (0.29-1.30%) of memory CD8+ T cells
were identified as SARS-CoV-2-specific, while 0.62% (0.51-0.75%) of CD4+ T cells 
and 0.47% (0.38-0.58%) of CD8+ T cells were SARS-CoV-2-specific terminally
differentiated effector memory cells. Furthermore, age and interval between doses
affected the magnitude of CoronaVac-induced immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 memory
CD4+ T cells were strongly associated with both receptor binding domain
(RBD)-specific memory B cells (r 0.87, p <0.0001) and SARS-CoV-2-specific memory 
CD8+ T cells (r 0.48, p <0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: CoronaVac induced robust circulating and memory B cell and T cell
responses. Our study offers new insight into the underlying immunobiology of
inactivated virus vaccines in humans and may have implications for vaccine
strategies in the future.
