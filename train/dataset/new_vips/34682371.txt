Based on the customer satisfaction index model, we constructed an elderly care
service satisfaction model that includes 5 latent variables and 16 observed
variables. To analyze the degree of satisfaction of elderly individuals in
nursing homes, we used structural equation model (SEM) to test the nursing
service elderly satisfaction model. With the help of AMOS 22.0 software, we
analyzed the degree of model fit and the behavioral relationships between the
variables that affect the path. We found that the satisfaction of Chinese urban
elderly individuals in nursing homes is at a moderate level, which is lower than 
the quality expected by elderly individuals. The customer satisfaction index
model can be applied to assess satisfaction with nursing services. Furthermore,
perceived quality and value have a significant impact on satisfaction.
