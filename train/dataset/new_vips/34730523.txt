OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics and
distribution of trauma surgeries performed in the first phase of the COVID-19
pandemic, the second phase of the pandemic, and the normal period before the
pandemic.
METHODS: Three different time periods were determined.Group 1 represented the
first wave of the pandemic, in which lockdowns andrestrictions were strictly
applied and only emergency and trauma surgeries wereperformed, between 1 April
and 31 May 2020. Group 2 represented the second waveof the pandemic, during which
restrictions were not applied and only emergencyand trauma surgeries were
performed, from 1 September to 31 October 2020. Group3 represented the normal
period before the pandemic, including surgeriesperformed between 1 September and 
31 October 2019. In addition, patients ineach group were divided into two groups 
as younger than 16 or older than 16 inorder to understand the difference between 
paediatric and adult orthopaedictraumas. The distribution of patients and their
fractures were evaluated.
RESULTS: In Group 1, the rates of intra-articular fractures, distal extremity
fractures, and proximal humerus fractures decreased, while the rate of proximal
femur fractures increased (P < 0.05 for all). The frequency of hand fractures
treated in Groups 1 and 2 compared to Group 3 was reduced (P < 0.05 for both).
There was no statistically significant difference between Groups 2 and 3 for
fractures in different parts of the body except for hand fractures (P = 0.001 for
hand fractures, P > 0.05 for the other fractures).
CONCLUSION: We observed that the frequency of fractures decreased, and the
distribution changed due to severe restrictions and lockdowns in the first wave
of the pandemic. When the restrictions and lockdowns were removed in the second
wave, the frequency of fractures decreased, but the distribution of fractures was
similar to the normal period in 2019.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Diagnostic Study.
