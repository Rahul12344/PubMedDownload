Cell fusion is a well-known, but still scarcely understood biological phenomenon,
which might play a role in cancer initiation, progression and formation of
metastases. Although the merging of two (cancer) cells appears simple, the entire
process is highly complex, energy-dependent and tightly regulated. Among cell
fusion-inducing and -regulating factors, so-called fusogens have been identified 
as a specific type of proteins that are indispensable for overcoming
fusion-associated energetic barriers and final merging of plasma membranes. About
8% of the human genome is of retroviral origin and some well-known fusogens, such
as syncytin-1, are expressed by human (cancer) cells. Likewise, enveloped viruses
can enable and facilitate cell fusion due to evolutionarily optimized fusogens,
and are also capable to induce bi- and multinucleation underlining their fusion
capacity. Moreover, multinucleated giant cancer cells have been found in tumors
derived from oncogenic viruses. Accordingly, a potential correlation between
viruses and fusogens of human endogenous retroviral origin in cancer cell fusion 
will be summarized in this review.
