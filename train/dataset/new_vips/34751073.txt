As a bioactive component in Capsicum species, capsaicin is a compound of hot
chili peppers which is known as the main substance responsible for the spiciness 
of these fruits. Besides its taste and physiological effects, it exhibits good
antioxidant activity in food matrix and antimicrobial activity against foodborne 
pathogens and viruses. Considering its low stability and bioaccessibility, and
also regarding its irritation, the entrapment methods of capsaicin are fully
developed. To compensate the limitations of capsaicin, various encapsulation
methods have been used so far, including coacervation, emulsion, spray chilling, 
and liposomal delivery. Capsaicin has been widely used as a flavoring and
preservative agent in food formulations and even as an active compound in
packaging film and functional foods. This review provides an overview of the
techno-functional properties, stabilization procedures, and burgeoning usages of 
capsaicin in the latest studies of the food sector. So, it may introduce new
windows for the application of this compound.
