Background: Although vaccines effectively prevent COVID-19 in healthy
individuals, they appear less immunogenic in individuals with chronic
inflammatory diseases (CID) or receiving chronic immunosuppression therapy.
Methods: Here, we assessed a cohort of 77 CID patients treated as monotherapy
with chronic immunosuppressive drugs for antibody responses in serum against
historical and variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses after immunization with the BNT162b2
mRNA vaccine.
Findings: Longitudinal analysis showed the greatest reductions in neutralizing
antibodies and Fc effector functions capacity in individuals treated with TNF-α
inhibitors (TNFi), and this pattern appeared worse against B.1.617.2 Delta virus.
Within five months of vaccination, serum neutralizing titers of all TNFi-treated 
patients tested fell below the presumed threshold correlate for antibody-mediated
protection. However, TNFi-treated patients receiving a third mRNA vaccine dose
boosted their serum neutralizing antibody titers by more than 16-fold.
Conclusions: Thus, vaccine boosting or administration of long-acting prophylaxis 
(e.g., monoclonal antibodies) likely will be required to prevent SARS-CoV-2
infection in this susceptible population.
