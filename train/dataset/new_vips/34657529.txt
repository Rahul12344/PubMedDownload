Sequencing of the human genome and numerous advances in molecular techniques have
launched the era of genetic medicine. Increasingly precise technologies for
genetic modification, manufacturing, and administration of pharmaceutical-grade
biologics have proved the viability of in vivo gene therapy (GTx) as a
therapeutic modality as shown in several thousand clinical trials and recent
approval of several GTx products for treating rare diseases and cancers. In
recognition of the rapidly advancing knowledge in this field, the regulatory
landscape has evolved considerably to maintain appropriate monitoring of safety
concerns associated with this modality. Nonetheless, GTx safety assessment
remains complex and is designed on a case-by-case basis that is determined by the
disease indication and product attributes. This article describes our current
understanding of fundamental biological principles and possible procedures
(emphasizing those related to toxicology and toxicologic pathology) needed to
support research and development of in vivo GTx products. This article is not
intended to provide comprehensive guidance on all GTx modalities but instead
provides an overview relevant to in vivo GTx generally by utilizing recombinant
adeno-associated virus-based GTx-the most common in vivo GTx platform-to
exemplify the main points to be considered in nonclinical research and
development of GTx products.
