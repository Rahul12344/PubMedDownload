BACKGROUNDS: ALT ≥ 80 U/L and HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/ml are treatment criteria of
APASL guidelines for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The need of antiviral
therapy for patients in gray zone (ALT < 80 U/L or HBV DNA < 2000 IU/ml) is
controversial. This study aimed to develop a scoring system to predict
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluate the benefit of antiviral therapy in
these patients.
METHODS: Seven hundred and forty-nine patients were analyzed. Significant
variables were weighted to develop a scoring system for HCC prediction. The area 
under receiver operating curves (AUROC) were estimated and validated by
REVEAL-HBV cohort (n = 3527).
RESULTS: Older age (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.036), family history of HCC
(p = 0.002) and HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/ml (p = 0.045) were independently associated
with HCC. A 14-point risk score system predicts 3 and 5-years HCC risk to be
0.866 and 0.868 of AUROC, respectively in the derivation cohort; 0.821 and 0.820,
in the REVEAL-HBV cohort. The cumulative HCC incidence was higher in the high
risk (score ≥ 8) group both in derivation and validation cohorts (p < 0.001).
Patients with antiviral therapy had lower HCC incidence compared to those without
(p = 0.016). Of note, antiviral therapy significantly decreased HCC in the high
risk group (p = 0.005), but not in the low risk group (p = 0.705).
CONCLUSIONS: A risk scoring system is established and validated. Of CHB patients 
in gray zone of APASL guidelines, those with risk scores ≥ 8 had higher risk of
HCC, but the risk could be significantly reduced by antiviral therapy.
