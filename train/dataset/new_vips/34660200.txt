Objectives: In contrast to other cities worldwide, the pandemic has not decimated
bus ridership in Hanoi. Notably, the Vietnamese capital has mostly relied on the 
use of face masks and hand sanitizer during travel, instead of requiring physical
distancing on buses. This study examines public bus passengers' levels of
compliance with Covid-19 safety measures, and the factors that affect compliance.
Methods: Face-to-face surveys were administered between 7 September and 3 October
2020, right after the end of the third wave of Covid-19 in Hanoi on 51 bus
routes. Exploratory Factor Analysis was carried out to extract factors from
attitudinal statements. The extracted factors, passengers' socio-demographic
traits, and their bus use patterns were modelled to determine which variables
lead to more compliance with Covid-19 safety measures.
Results: We found that 100% of passengers wore face masks (which were mandated), 
albeit 11% did so incorrectly, while only 28% of passengers used the hand
sanitizer provided by bus operators (which was recommended but not required). In 
addition, 38% of passengers carried their own bottles of hand sanitizer while
travelling, despite a relatively low risk of contracting the virus. Women, older 
passengers, and urbanites were less likely to sanitise their hands. Frequent bus 
travellers behaved like the population at large with regard to protective
measures against Covid-19.
Conclusions: Hanoi's overall measures - full use of face masks and partial use of
hand sanitizer - were sufficient to contain three relatively minor Covid-19 waves
while still maintaining regular bus operations most of the time. If other cities 
were able to reach these levels of compliance, most would be in much better
position vis-à-vis public transport use during the pandemic (or an epidemic). Our
findings suggest that mandates work much better than awareness raising campaigns,
although the latter have a role to play.
