Members of the Poxviridae family are large double-stranded DNA viruses that
replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of their hosts. This goes in hand with a
high level of independence from the host cell, which supports transcription and
replication events only in the nucleus or in DNA-containing organelles.
Consequently, virus specific, rather than cellular enzymes mediate most processes
involving DNA replication and mRNA synthesis. Recent technological advances
allowed a detailed functional and structural investigation of the transcription
machinery of the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia. The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RNAP) at its core displays distinct similarities to eukaryotic RNAPs. Strong
idiosyncrasies, however, are apparent for viral factors that are associated with 
the viral RNAP during mRNA production. We expect that future studies will unravel
more key aspects of poxvirus gene expression, helping also the understanding of
nuclear transcription mechanisms.
