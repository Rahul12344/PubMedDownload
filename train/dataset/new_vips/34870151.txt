Remdesivir, a monophosphate prodrug of nucleoside analog GS-441524, is widely
used for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. It has been suggested to
use GS-441524 instead of remdesivir in the clinic and in new inhalation
formulations. Thus, we compared the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of remdesivir and
GS-441524 in Vero E6, Vero CCL-81, Calu-3, Caco-2 ​cells, and anti-HCoV-OC43
activity in Huh-7 ​cells. We also compared the cellular pharmacology of these two
compounds in Vero E6, Vero CCL-81, Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh-7, 293T, BHK-21, 3T3 and
human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. Overall, remdesivir exhibited greater
potency and superior intracellular metabolism than GS-441524 except in Vero E6
and Vero CCL-81 ​cells.
