INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection endemic in Singapore.
Its impact in renal transplantation is limited to small case series. We aimed to 
characterise the clinical presentation and outcomes of dengue infection among
renal transplant recipients in Singapore.
METHODS: We conducted a 15-year retrospective review of dengue in renal
transplant patients treated at Singapore General Hospital between January 2005
and October 2019. The diagnosis of dengue was made if there were a compatible
clinical syndrome and a positive dengue diagnostic assay (Dengue NS1 antigen, IgM
or RT-PCR).
RESULTS: 31 patients were diagnosed with dengue, 18 (58.1%) were deceased donor
recipients. The median age was 52 (IQR 40-61) years; 16 (51.6%) were females. The
median time to diagnosis was 99 (IQR 18-169) months from transplant. The most
common clinical symptoms were fever (87.1%), myalgia (41.9%), gastrointestinal
symptoms (38.7%) and headache (25.8%). 19 (61.3%) patients had dengue without
warning signs, 9 (29.0%) had dengue with warning signs, 3 (9.7%) had severe
dengue and 30 (96.8%) were hospitalized. 17 (54.8%) patients had graft
dysfunction, 16 (94.1%) of whom had recovery of graft function. 1 (3.2%) patient 
required dialysis and subsequently died. There were two cases of donor-derived
infections (DDIs) with favourable outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our experience with dengue in renal transplant recipients is
concordant with published data. Although graft dysfunction is common, it is often
transient with favourable outcomes. Outpatient management may be considered for
mild infections. Although dengue DDIs are uncommon, more stringent donor
screening may be considered in endemic regions.
