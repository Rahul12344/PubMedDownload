Wastewater surveillance for pathogens using reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an effective and resource-efficient tool for gathering
community-level public health information, including the incidence of coronavirus
disease-19 (COVID-19). Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater can potentially provide an early warning
signal of COVID-19 infections in a community. The capacity of the world's
environmental microbiology and virology laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
characterization in wastewater is increasing rapidly. However, there are no
standardized protocols or harmonized quality assurance and quality control
(QA/QC) procedures for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance. This paper is a
technical review of factors that can cause false-positive and false-negative
errors in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, culminating in
recommended strategies that can be implemented to identify and mitigate some of
these errors. Recommendations include stringent QA/QC measures, representative
sampling approaches, effective virus concentration and efficient RNA extraction, 
PCR inhibition assessment, inclusion of sample processing controls, and
considerations for RT-PCR assay selection and data interpretation. Clear data
interpretation guidelines (e.g., determination of positive and negative samples) 
are critical, particularly when the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is low.
Corrective and confirmatory actions must be in place for inconclusive results or 
results diverging from current trends (e.g., initial onset or reemergence of
COVID-19 in a community). It is also prudent to perform interlaboratory
comparisons to ensure results' reliability and interpretability for prospective
and retrospective analyses. The strategies that are recommended in this review
aim to improve SARS-CoV-2 characterization and detection for wastewater
surveillance applications. A silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the
efficacy of wastewater surveillance continues to be demonstrated during this
global crisis. In the future, wastewater should also play an important role in
the surveillance of a range of other communicable diseases.
