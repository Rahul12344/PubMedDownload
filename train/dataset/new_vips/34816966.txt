OBJECTIVE: to analyze the stigma characteristics perceived in the experience of
men who had COVID-19.
METHOD: this qualitative study involved men living in Brazil, diagnosed with
COVID-19, who answered semi-structured questions in an online form. Data were
subjected to thematic and lexical analysis, interpreted in the light of the
stigma theory.
RESULTS: 92 men, adults, cisgender, heterosexual, of mixed race/color, belonging 
to middle class, living in the urban area, with higher education participated.
The stigma characteristics evidenced were the occurrence of leave, perception of 
impolite treatment, use of labels and discrimination by co-workers, family
members, neighbors and even healthcare professionals, with consequences for the
psycho-emotional dimension.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: discrimination and exclusion derived from stigma surprised 
men marked by class and gender privileges, little used to being downgraded in
interactions when compared to other groups.
