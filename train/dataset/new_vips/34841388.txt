Background: Gam-COVID-Vac (SPUTNIK V) has been granted emergency use
authorization in 70 nations and has been administered to millions worldwide.
However, there are very few peer-reviewed studies describing its effects.
Independent reports regarding safety and effectiveness could accelerate the final
approval by the WHO. We aimed to study the long-term humoral immune response in
naïve and previously infected volunteers who received SPUTNIK V.
Methods: Humoral immune responses, assayed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike-RBD IgG ELISA
and neutralization assays, were measured in 602 healthcare workers at 0, 14, 28, 
60 and 180 days after receiving SPUTNIK V between December 2020 and July 2021 in 
Tucumán, Argentina.
Findings: Seroconversion was detected in 97% of individuals after 28 days
post-vaccination (dpv) (N = 405). Anti-RBD titers began to decrease after 60 dpv 
(N = 328), but remained detectable in 94% at 90 dpv (N = 224). At 180 dpv,
anti-RDB titers persisted in 31% (N = 146). Previous infection triggered an
increased immune response to the first dose and increased neutralization activity
against variants of concern (VOC). Second doses in previously infected
individuals further increased titers, even 90 dpv (N = 75). Basal antibody titers
had more influence on post-vaccination anti-RBD responses than the time elapsed
between diagnosis and vaccination (N = 274).
Interpretation: Data presented herein provides essential knowledge regarding the 
kinetics of antibodies induced by SPUTNIK V up to six months after immunization, 
and suggests that when considering one-dose vaccination policies for individuals 
with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, serological studies to determine basal titers
may be important, independent of when diagnosis occurred.
