Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases
(EBV-T/NK-LPDs) are a cluster of diseases that include chronic active EBV
infection (CAEBV) and aggressive NK cell leukemia (ANKL). The pathogenesis of
EBV-T/NK-LPDs is largely unclear and the treatment is difficult and in most cases
a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is needed. Hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is known to affect the prognosis of patients with
EBV-T/NK-LPDs. This study reports a case of a 20-year-old male patient with
repeated infectious mononucleosis (IM)-like symptoms such as high fever,
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy for more than two years. The patient had a high
EBV-DNA load (NK cells were the main target cells). He was first diagnosed as
CAEBV. However, the disease gradually progressed and the patient developed with
high ferritin, phagocytosis and monoclonal NK cells in bone marrow, pancytopenia,
increased cytokines, and elevated expression of Ki-67. Also, his NK cells had
abnormal immunophenotypes and impaired function. The patient had a typical
clinical course of progression from CAEBV to ANKL, accompanied by HLH
complications and a poor prognosis. Herein, the detailed diagnostic and
differential diagnostic process of EBV infection was shown in this report.
