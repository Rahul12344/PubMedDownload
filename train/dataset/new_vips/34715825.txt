BACKGROUND: Stigma associated with infectious diseases is common and causes
various negative effects on stigmatized people. With Wuhan as the center of the
COVID-19 outbreak in China, its people were likely to be the target of
stigmatization. To evaluate the severity of stigmatization toward Wuhan people
and provide necessary information for stigma mitigation, this study aimed to
identify the stigmatizing attitudes toward Wuhan people and trace their changes
as COVID-19 progresses in China by analyzing related posts on social media.
METHODS: We collected 19,780 Weibo posts containing the keyword 'Wuhan people'
and performed a content analysis to identify stigmatizing attitudes in the posts.
Then, we divided our observation time into three periods and performed
repeated-measures ANOVA to compare the differences in attitudes during the three 
periods.
RESULTS: The results showed that stigma was mild, with 2.46% of related posts
being stigmatizing. The percentages of stigmatizing posts differed significantly 
during the three periods. The percentages of 'Infectious' posts and 'Stupid'
posts were significantly different for the three periods. The percentage of
'Irresponsible' posts was not significantly different for the three periods.
After government interventions, stigma did not decrease significantly, and stigma
with the 'Infectious' attitude even increased. It was not until the government
interventions took effect that stigma significantly reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that stigma toward Wuhan people included diverse
attitudes and changed at different periods. After government interventions but
before they took effect, stigma with the 'Infectious' attitude increased. After
government interventions took effect, general stigma and stigmas with
'Infectious' and 'Stupid' attitudes decreased. This study constituted an
important endeavor to understand the stigma toward Wuhan people in China during
the COVID-19 epidemic. Implications for stigma reduction and improvement of the
public's perception during different periods of epidemic control are discussed.
