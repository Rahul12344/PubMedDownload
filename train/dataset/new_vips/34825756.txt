Constrained peptides are promising next-generation therapeutics. We report here a
fundamentally new strategy for the facile generation of bicyclic peptides using
linear precursor peptides with three cysteine residues and non-toxic trivalent
bismuth(III) salt. Peptide-bismuth bicycles form instantaneously at physiological
pH, are stable in aqueous solution for many weeks, and much more resistant to
proteolysis than their linear precursors. The strategy allows the in-situ
generation of bicyclic ligands for biochemical screening assays. We demonstrate
this for two screening campaigns targeting the proteases from Zika and West Nile 
viruses, revealing a new lead compound that displayed inhibition constants of 23 
and 150 nM, respectively. Bicyclic peptides are up to 130 times more active and
19 times more proteolytically stable than their linear analogs without bismuth.
