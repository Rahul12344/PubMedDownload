In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, simple, rapid, point-of-care tests not
requiring trained personnel for primary care testing are essential. Saliva-based 
antigen rapid tests (ARTs) can fulfil this need, but these tests
require overnight-fasted samples; without which independent studies have
demonstrated sensitivities of only 11.7 to 23.1%. Herein, we report an Amplified 
Parallel ART (AP-ART) with sensitivity above 90%, even with non-fasted samples.
The virus was captured multimodally, using both anti-spike protein antibodies and
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. It also featured two parallel
flow channels. The first contained spike protein binding gold nanoparticles which
produced a visible red line upon encountering the virus. The second contained
signal amplifying nanoparticles that complex with the former and amplify the
signal without any linker. Compared to existing dual gold amplification
techniques, a limit of detection of one order of magnitude lower was achieved
(0.0064 ng·mL-1). AP-ART performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva of
COVID-19 patients was investigated using a case-control study (139 participants
enrolled and 162 saliva samples tested). Unlike commercially available ARTs, the 
sensitivity of AP-ART was maintained even when non-fasting saliva was used.
Compared to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
testing on nasopharyngeal samples, non-fasting saliva tested on AP-ART showed a
sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI: 84.7-99.8); without amplification, the sensitivity 
was 72.7% (95% CI: 83.7-94.8). Thus, AP-ART has the potential to be developed for
point-of-care testing, which may be particularly important in resource-limited
settings, and for early diagnosis to initiate newly approved therapies to reduce 
COVID-19 severity.
