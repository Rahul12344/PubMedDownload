We report a 47-year-old male with a severe disease caused by COVID-19, who
required mechanical ventilation for 18 ays. During the hospital stay he received 
dexamethasone and anticoagulation with heparin. After discharge a new chest CT
scan showed homogeneous hypo vascular enlargement of both adrenal glands, not
present in the initial imaging studies. It was interpreted as a subacute
bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. The patient remained stable and without any
complaint.
