Introduction. COVID-19 is a pathology caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The World
Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 225 million cases and 4.5
million deaths worldwide. Objective: To describe the seropositivity, spatial
distribution, and clinical and sociodemographic variables of SARS-CoV-2 in a
community of the Colombian Amazon region. Methods. In December 2020, a
cross-sectional observational study was carried out in a population located in
the Colombian Amazon in the municipality of Mitú. Sociodemographic and clinical
data were taken. Besides, 589 blood samples were taken, and an antibody detection
was carried out with an ELISA and a recombinant protein N antigen of SARS-CoV-2. 
Results. A seropositivity of 57.6% was observed. The highest proportion of the
infection is located in inter-municipal transport zones. The bivariate analysis
did not show differences in the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate concerning the
variables sex, age range, and the presence of comorbidities (p > 0.05). The
bivariate and multivariate analysis showed that being symptomatic and presenting 
neurological manifestations of the upper respiratory tract are clinical variables
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (p < 0.05). One of the causes of this
virus's high spread in this community could be that 53.3% of the people were
asymptomatic. Conclusions. Our data showed a high burden and transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 in the indigenous community. This could be linked to cultural
behaviors and the high infection rate in asymptomatic patients.
