BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used for hospitalized
coronavirus disease 2019 patients because of their antiviral and
anti-inflammatory function. However, little research has been published on the
impact of the immunomodulatory effect of (hydroxy)chloroquine on humoral
immunity.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of symptomatic severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection, diagnosed 141 days after the first episode,
in a 56-year-old man of Black African origin treated with hydroxychloroquine for 
lupus erythematosus. No anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG 
antibodies could be detected 127 days after the initial episode of coronavirus
disease 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with hydroxychloroquine probably explains the
decreased immune response with negative serology and subsequent reinfection in
our patient. As humoral immunity is crucial to fight a severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine is likely to
have a detrimental effect on the spread of the virus. This case emphasizes that
more needs to be learned about the role of antibodies in protecting against
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (re)infection and the role of
(hydroxy)chloroquine on humoral immunity.
