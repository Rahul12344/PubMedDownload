Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections elicit
both humoral and cellular immune responses. For the prevention and treatment of
COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, it has become increasingly apparent
that T cell responses are equally if not more important than humoral responses in
mediating recovery and immune protection. One major challenge in developing T
cell-based therapies for infectious and malignant diseases has been the
identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell
response. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico
methods to predict putative epitopes deduced from binding affinities. Our studies
find that, in contrast to current convention, "immunodominant" SARS-CoV-2
peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses 
recognizing naturally presented SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. We postulated that
immunogenic epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 are best defined empirically by directly
analyzing peptides eluted from the naturally processed peptide-major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and then validating immunogenicity by
determining whether such peptides can elicit T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2
antigen-expressing cells. Using a tandem mass spectrometry approach, we
identified epitopes derived from not only structural but also nonstructural genes
in regions highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains, including recently
recognized variants. Finally, there are no reported T cell receptor-engineered T 
cell technology that can redirect T cell specificity to recognize and kill
SARS-CoV-2 target cells. We report here several SARS-CoV-2 epitopes defined by
mass spectrometric analysis of MHC-eluted peptides, provide empiric evidence for 
their immunogenicity, and demonstrate engineered TCR-redirected killing.
