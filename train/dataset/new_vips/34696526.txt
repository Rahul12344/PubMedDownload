Advances in nanotechnology have enabled the development of a new generation of
vaccines, which are playing a critical role in the global control of the COVID-19
pandemic and the return to normalcy. Vaccine development has been conducted, by
and large, by countries in the global north. South Africa, as a major emerging
economy, has made extensive investments in nanotechnology and bioinformatics and 
has the expertise and resources in vaccine development and manufacturing. This
has been built at a national level through decades of investment. In this
perspective article, we provide a synopsis of the investments made in
nanotechnology and highlight how these could support innovation, research, and
development for vaccines for this disease. We also discuss the application of
bioinformatics tools to support rapid and cost-effective vaccine development and 
make recommendations for future research and development in this area to support 
future health challenges.
