Background: African swine fever (ASF) is an important disease affecting swine and
has a significant economic loss in both the developed and developing world.
Aim: In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of medium-chain fatty
acids (MCFAs) in individual and synergistic forms to prevent and/or reduce ASF
virus (ASFV) infection using in vitro feed model.
Methods: The cytotoxicity of MCFAs on porcine alveolar macrophages cells was
evaluated by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay. The potential effects of MCFAs, including C8 (caprylic acid),
C8-C6-C10 (caprylic acid-caproic acid-capric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) and C8-C10-C12
(caprylic acid-capric acid-lauric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) against a field ASFV strain 
isolated in the capital Hanoi of Vietnam, were further examined by real-time PCR 
and haemadsorption assays in in vitro feed model.
Results: Our results indicated that all tested products do not induce
cytotoxicity at the dose of 100 μg/ml and are suitable for further in vitro
examination. These products have shown a strong antiviral effect against ASFV
infectivity at doses of 0.375% and 0.5%. Interestingly, the synergistic MCFAs
have shown clearly their potential activities against ASFV in which at a lower
dose of 0.25%, pre-treatment with product two and three induced significant
increases at the level of Cq value when compared to positive control and/or
product 1 (p < 0.05). However, the viral titre was not changed after 24 hours
post-inoculation when compared to positive control. Our findings suggested that
all tested products, both individual and synergistic forms of MCFAs, have
possessed a strong anti-ASFV effect, and this effect is dose-dependence in in
vitro feed model. Additionally, synergistic effects of MCFAs are more effective
against ASFV when compared to individual forms.
Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFAs, both
individual and synergistic forms, inhibit against a field ASFV strain in the feed
model, which may support minimizing the risk of ASF transmission in the pig
population. Further studies focusing on in vivo anti-ASFV effects of MCFAs are
important to bring new insight into the mode of ASFV-reduced action by these
compounds in swine feed.
