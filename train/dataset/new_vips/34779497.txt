Epstein‑Barr virus (EBV) is endemic worldwide and is associated with a number of 
human tumors. EBV‑associated tumors have unique mechanisms of tumorigenesis. EBV 
encodes multiple oncogenic molecules that can be loaded into exosomes released by
EBV+ tumor cells to mediate intercellular communication. Moreover, different EBV+
tumor cells secrete exosomes that act on various target cells with various
biological functions. In addition to oncogenicity, EBV+ exosomes have potential
immunosuppressive effects. Investigating EBV+ exosomes could identify the role of
EBV in tumorigenesis and progression. The present review summarized advances in
studies focusing on exosomes and the functions of EBV+ exosomes derived from
different EBV‑associated tumors. EBV+ exosomes are expected to become a new
biomarker for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, exosome‑targeted
therapy displays potential.
