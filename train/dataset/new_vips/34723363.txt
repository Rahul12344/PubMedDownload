The rapid global transmission of COVID-19 has demonstrated many weaknesses in
government procurement of essential supplies. In the United States, these
problems have been particularly evident, as systemic fragmentation through
federalism has frustrated a coordinated response. Rather than working together,
states and localities are competing over limited medical resources, while the
federal government has not stepped in to alleviate burdens on the lower tiers of 
government. In this study, we introduce how procurement is managed under normal
circumstances and how it changes during emergencies. Easing procurement rules
comes with necessary tradeoffs, particularly involving equity and accountability.
Using case studies from recent disasters, we identify procurement and management 
recommendations for the COVID-19 response and future emergencies. We conclude
that public procurement is integral to effective management in the 21st century
and must be treated as such in the study and practice of public administration
and emergency management.
