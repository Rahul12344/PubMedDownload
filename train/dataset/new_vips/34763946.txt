BACKGROUND: Post-authorization monitoring of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines is
needed to better characterize their reactogenicity. We assessed reactions
reported during the 2 weeks after receipt of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and
mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines.
METHODS: We monitored persons who enrolled in v-safe after vaccination health
checkerSM, a U.S. smartphone-based vaccine monitoring system, after receiving
BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. V-safe participants received text message prompts to
complete web-based surveys. We analyzed responses from persons who received
BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 from December 14, 2020 through March 14, 2021 and completed
at least one survey by March 28, 2021. We measured the proportion of participants
reporting local and systemic reactions solicited in surveys completed days 0
through 7 post-vaccination. For day 14 surveys, participants described new or
worsening symptoms in a free-text response. We assessed the proportion of
participants reporting new or worsening local and systemic reactions.
RESULTS: One-third of participants were aged <45 years, two-thirds were female,
and approximately half received BNT162b2 vaccine. A total of 4,717,908
participants reported during the 7 days after dose 1 and 2,906,377 reported
during the 7 days after dose 2. Most reported at least one injection-site
reaction (68.5% after dose 1; 72.9% after dose 2) or at least one systemic
reaction (50.6% after dose 1; 69.5% after dose 2). Reactogenicity was greater
after dose 2 and among mRNA-1273 recipients, persons aged <45 years, and females.
New or worsening local and systemic reactions were uncommon during week 2 after
either dose; the most frequent were local reactions for dose 1 mRNA-1273
recipients (2.6%). These reactions were reported more often among females after
dose 1 mRNA-1273 (3.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: During post-authorization monitoring among >4 million vaccinees,
local and systemic reactions were commonly reported following mRNA-based
vaccines. Reactions were most common during the first week following dose 2 and
among persons aged <45 years, females, and mRNA-1273 recipients.
