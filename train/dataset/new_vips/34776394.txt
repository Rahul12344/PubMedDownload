INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Viral hepatitis, which appears most frequently at birth or
during childhood, is a disease whose transmission routes include tears, bile,
sexual fluids, sweat, milk, urine, feces, and saliva. The aim of the present
study was to analyze the specificity of the immunochromatographic and ELISA
diagnostic tests for hepatitis B surface antigen and compare them with PCR
testing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample was made up of 140 men and 60 women
referred to the Urmia Medical University hospital to undergo PCR testing for HBV 
diagnosis. The ELISA test was performed using the Pioneer Medicine Company kit
(Tehran, Iran).
RESULTS: The results of the HBs-Ag rapid test and the ELISA test were compared
with the PCR test. The HBs-Ag rapid test had 97% sensitivity and 91% specificity,
whereas the ELISA test had 78% sensitivity and 76% specificity.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: According to our results, the immunochromatographic
test was accurate for diagnosing HBs-Ag in blood and the ELISA test had
acceptable sensitivity and specificity, compared with PCR testing.
