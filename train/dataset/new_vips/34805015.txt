Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of liver-related
mortality. Serum pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been revealed to be associated with the
development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. This study evaluated whether 
serum PTX3 is related to the survival of HBV-related HCC patients.
Methods: One hundred and seven patients with HBV-related HCC were included.
Baseline serum PTX3 levels were quantified using quantitative immunoassay. The
HCC patients were followed-up for a median of 24 months and divided into high
serum PTX3 level and low PTX3 level groups according to the baseline serum PTX3
levels. The overall survivals of the HBV-related HCC patients according to the
serum PTX3 levels were compared. Factors potentially influencing the prognosis of
the patients with HBV-related HCC were analyzed.
Results: HCC patients with high serum PTX3 levels [PTX3 > 9.25ng/mL (n=85)] had a
shorter overall survival time than HCC patients with low serum PTX3 levels [PTX3 
≤ 9.25ng/mL (n=22)] (P = 0.049). HCC patients with serum PTX3 levels between
>9.25ng/mL and ≤9.25ng/mL had significant difference in HCC histology grade.
Multivariate analysis showed that PTX3 level was an independent risk factor
related to the overall survival of HCC patients (hazard ratio: 1.058, 95%
confidence interval: 1.031-1.085, P <0.001).
Conclusion: These results support the involvement of PTX3 in the disease
progression of HCC and suggest the potential of using serum PTX3 levels as a
biomarker for the prognostic prediction of HBV-related HCC patients.
