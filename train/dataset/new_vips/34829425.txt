In clinical studies, case definitions are usually designed to optimally match the
desired clinical state, because lacking specificity is associated with a risk of 
bias regarding the study outcome. In preventive medicine, however, high
sensitivity is sometimes considered as more critical in order not to overlook
infectious individuals, because the latter may be associated with ongoing spread 
of a transmittable disease. Accordingly, this work was focused on a theoretical
model on how the sensitivity of case definitions can be optimized by adding
clinical symptoms to diagnostic results for preventive purposes, if the
associated reduction in specificity is considered as acceptable. The model was
exemplified with an analysis on whether and in how far exposure risk can be
reduced by the inclusion of observable symptoms during seroconversion syndrome in
case of rapid diagnostic test-based prevention of sexual HIV transmission. The
approach provided a high level of safety (negative predictive values close to 1) 
for the price of a considerably number of false positives (positive predictive
values < 0.01 for some subpopulations). When applying such a
sensitivity-optimized screening as a "diagnostics as prevention" strategy, the
advantages of excellent negative predictive values need to be cautiously balanced
against potential undesirable consequences of low positive predictive values.
