Brassica yellows virus (BrYV) is a tentative species of the genus Polerovirus,
which has at least three genotypes (A, B, and C) in China. The P0 protein of
BrYV-A (P0BrA) has been identified as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR), 
which can also induce cell death in infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. In 
this study, we demonstrated that the cell death induced by P0BrA was accompanied 
by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased
Pathogenesis-related protein genes-1 (PR1) expression. Meanwhile, this cell death
phenotype was delayed by salicylic acid (SA) pretreatment. Biological function
comparison of the three P0 proteins showed that transiently expressed P0BrB or
P0BrC induced a significantly delayed and milder cell death response compared
with P0BrA. However, like P0BrA, they also suppressed local and systemic RNA
silencing. Six residues of P0BrA essential for inducing cell death were
identified by comparative analysis and amino acid substitution assay. We also
show that all three BrYV genotypes have synergistic interactions with pea enation
mosaic virus 2 (PEMV 2) in N. benthamiana. This study provides theoretical
guidance for controlling the viral disease caused by poleroviruses in the future.
