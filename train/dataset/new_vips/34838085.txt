Dabieshan tick virus (DTV) was first identified in Haemaphysalis longicornis from
Hubei Province, China in 2015. However, its pathogenic potential to animals and
human remains to be further explored. In this study, a total of 170 engorged
ticks and 22 sheep serum samples were collected from Taian and Yantai city,
Shandong Province to investigate the presence of DTV. The results of qRT-PCR
revealed the positive rate of 13.6% (3/22) in sheep serum and 8.2% (14/170) in
attached ticks, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close
evolutionary relationship among those DTV isolates from animal and ticks, and DTV
might be relatively conservative in evolution. These findings are the first to
demonstrate molecular evidence of DTV in domestic animals. Nonetheless, whether
or not causing disease in animals, DTV deserves further investigation.
