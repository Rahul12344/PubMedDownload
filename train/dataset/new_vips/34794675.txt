Childhood tuberculosis (TB) has been underreported and underrepresented in TB
statistics across the globe. Contributing factors include health system barriers,
diagnostic barriers, and community barriers leading to an underdetected epidemic 
of childhood tuberculosis. Despite considerable progress in childhood TB
management, there is a concerning gap in policy and practice in high-burden
countries leading to missed opportunities for active case detection, early
diagnosis and treatment of TB exposure, and infection and disease in children
regardless of human immunodeficiency virus status. Bridging this gap requires
multisectoral coordination and political commitment along with an eye to research
and innovation with potential to scale.
