The whole world faces a pandemic situation due to the deadly virus, namely
COVID-19. It takes considerable time to get the virus well-matured to be traced, 
and during this time, it may be transmitted among other people. To get rid of
this unexpected situation, quick identification of COVID-19 patients is required.
We have designed and optimized a machine learning-based framework using
inpatient's facility data that will give a user-friendly, cost-effective, and
time-efficient solution to this pandemic. The proposed framework uses Bayesian
optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the classifier and ADAptive
SYNthetic (ADASYN) algorithm to balance the COVID and non-COVID classes of the
dataset. Although the proposed technique has been applied to nine
state-of-the-art classifiers to show the efficacy, it can be used to many
classifiers and classification problems. It is evident from this study that
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) provides the highest Kappa index of 97.00%.
Compared to without ADASYN, our proposed approach yields an improvement in the
kappa index of 96.94%. Besides, Bayesian optimization has been compared to grid
search, random search to show efficiency. Furthermore, the most dominating
features have been identified using SHapely Adaptive exPlanations (SHAP)
analysis. A comparison has also been made among other related works. The proposed
method is capable enough of tracing COVID patients spending less time than that
of the conventional techniques. Finally, two potential applications, namely,
clinically operable decision tree and decision support system, have been
demonstrated to support clinical staff and build a recommender system.
