SARS-CoV-2, declared a pandemic in March 2020, is the current global health
challenge. The global bioburden of this virus is increasing at a rapid pace. Many
antiviral drugs and vaccines have been registered for clinical trials because of 
their inhibitory activity observed in vitro. Currently, five types of vaccines
have successfully passed Phase IV clinical trial and are being administered in
populations worldwide. A plethora of experimental designs have been proposed
worldwide in order to find a safe and efficacious treatment option. Therefore, it
is necessary to provide baseline data and information to clinicians and
researchers so that they can review the current status of therapeutics and
efficacy of already developed vaccines. This review article summarizes all
therapeutic options that may help to combat SARS-CoV-2.
