PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The interplay between viral respiratory infections and
cardiovascular disease has been most comprehensively researched using seasonal
and pandemic influenza viruses as case studies. Here, we summarize the latest
international observational research and clinical trials that examined the
association between influenza, influenza vaccines, and cardiovascular disease,
while contextualizing their findings within those of landmark studies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent observational literature found that one in eight
adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection experienced an 
acute cardiovascular event. The latest meta-analysis of the cardioprotective
effects of influenza vaccine found a 25% reduced risk of all-cause death. There
are four large cardiovascular outcome trials assessing the cardioprotective
effects of different influenza vaccine strategies. Among these, the INVESTED
study showed there is no significant difference between the high-dose trivalent
and standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines in reducing all-cause mortality
or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations in a high-risk patient group with
pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Persons with cardiovascular disease
represent a high priority group for viral vaccines; hence, using robust evidence 
to increase vaccine confidence among patients and practitioners is integral as we
prepare for a possible influenza resurgence in the coming years.
