In some cases, antibodies can enhance virus entry and replication in cells. This 
phenomenon is called antibody-dependent infection enhancement (ADE). ADE not only
promotes the virus to be recognized by the target cell and enters the target
cell, but also affects the signal transmission in the target cell. Early
formalin-inactivated virus vaccines such as aluminum adjuvants (RSV and measles) 
have been shown to induce ADE. Although there is no direct evidence that there is
ADE in COVID-19, this potential risk is a huge challenge for prevention and
vaccine development. This article focuses on the virus-induced ADE phenomenon and
its molecular mechanism. It also summarizes various attempts in vaccine research 
and development to eliminate the ADE phenomenon, and proposes to avoid ADE in
vaccine development from the perspective of antigens and adjuvants.
