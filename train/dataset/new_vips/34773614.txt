Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a widely used technique in the diagnosis of
viral infections due to its low cost, high sensitivity, and specificity. Although
the more advanced variations of PCR, such as real-time PCR and digital PCR are
now available to researchers, conventional PCR is still used in many research
studies. Here we describe the protocol for tri-primer diagnostic reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of rubella in throat swabs 
and further detailed protocol for a two fragment genotyping using two different
sets of primers. In tri-primer diagnostic PCR, one forward and two reverse
primers are used to detect clade I and clade II of the rubella virus. In the two 
fragments genotyping, each fragment of the genome is amplified, sequenced
separately, and then the overlapping regions are aligned and full length sequence
window is obtained.
