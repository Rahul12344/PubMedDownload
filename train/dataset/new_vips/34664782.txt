INTRODUCTION: Endemic coronaviruses have been found in acute bronchiolitis,
mainly as a coinfecting virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for respiratory illness in hospitalized
children. The characteristics of patients with bronchiolitis have not been
extensively described.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of patients with bronchiolitis and SARS-CoV-2
infection enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort of children hospitalized
with COVID-19 in Spain from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021.
RESULTS: Twelve of 666 children infected with SARS-CoV-2 who required hospital
admission met the diagnostic criteria for bronchiolitis (1.8%). Median age was
1.9 months (range: 0.4-10.1). Six cases had household contact with a confirmed or
probable COVID-19 case. Main complaints were cough (11 patients), rhinorrhea
(10), difficulty breathing (8), and fever (8). Eleven cases were classified as
mild or moderate and one as severe. Laboratory tests performed in seven patients 
did not evidence anemia, lymphopenia, or high C-reactive protein levels. Chest
X-rays were performed in six children, and one case showed remarkable findings.
Coinfection with metapneumovirus was detected in the patient with the most severe
course; Bordetella pertussis was detected in another patient. Seven patients
required oxygen therapy. Albuterol was administered in four patients. One patient
was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Median length of admission was
4 days (range: 3-14). No patient died or showed any sequelae at discharge. Two
patients developed recurrent bronchospasms.
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection does not seem to be a main trigger of severe
bronchiolitis, and children with this condition should be managed according to
clinical practice guidelines.
