BACKGROUND: Workplace transmission is a significant contributor to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks. Previous studies have 
found that infectious illness presenteeism could contribute to outbreaks in
occupational settings and identified multiple occupational and organisational
risk factors. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to investigate
presenteeism particularly in relation to respiratory infectious disease (RID).
Hence, this rapid review aims to determine the prevalence of RID-related
presenteeism, including COVID-19, and examines the reported reasons and
associated risk factors.
METHODS: The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in
English and Chinese. Database searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, 
China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI) and preprint databases
MedRxiv and BioRxiv.
RESULTS: The search yielded 54 studies, of which four investigated
COVID-19-related presenteeism. Prevalence of work presenteeism ranged from 14.1
to 55% for confirmed RID, and 6.6 to 100% for those working with suspected or
subclinical RID. The included studies demonstrated that RID-related presenteeism 
is associated with occupation, sick pay policy, age, gender, health behaviour and
perception, vaccination, peer pressure and organisational factors such as
presenteeism culture.
CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates that presenteeism or non-adherence to
isolation guidance is a real concern and can contribute to workplace
transmissions and outbreaks. Policies which would support workers financially and
improve productivity, should include a range of effective non-pharmaceutical
inventions such as workplace testing, promoting occupational health services,
reviewing pay and bonus schemes and clear messaging to encourage workers to stay 
at home when ill. Future research should focus on the more vulnerable and
precarious occupational groups, and their inter-relationships, to develop
comprehensive intervention programs to reduce RID-related presenteeism.
