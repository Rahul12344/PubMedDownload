While classic vaccines have proved greatly efficacious in eliminating serious
infectious diseases, innovative vaccine platforms open a new pathway to overcome 
dangerous pandemics via the development of safe and effective formulations. Such 
platforms play a key role either as antigen delivery systems or as
immune-stimulators that induce both innate and adaptive immune responses.
Liposomes or lipid nanoparticles, virus-like particles, nanoemulsions, polymeric 
or inorganic nanoparticles, as well as viral vectors, all belong to the nanoscale
and are the main categories of innovative vaccines that are currently on the
market or in clinical and preclinical phases. In this paper, we review the above 
formulations used in vaccinology and we discuss their connection with the
development of safe and effective prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
