In the Netherlands, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant
impact on daily life, with two extensive lockdowns enforced to combat the spread 
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These measures included the closure of bars and
restaurants, and the transition from face-to-face to online education. A survey
was conducted among Dutch pharmacy students and PhD-candidates to investigate the
impact of COVID-19 lockdown on alcohol consumption, hangovers, and academic
functioning. The analysis revealed a significant reduction in both quantity and
frequency of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. This was
accompanied with a significant reduction in hangover frequency and lower hangover
severity during COVID-19 lockdown periods. The distribution of scores on academic
performance showed great variability between respondents: while some participants
reported impairment, others reported improved performance during the COVID-19
pandemic, or no change. Women reported that significantly more time investment
was associated with maintaining these performance levels. Consistent among
participants was the notion of reduced interactions with teachers and other
students. Participants who reported more hangovers and most severe hangovers
before COVID-19 benefited from the lockdown periods in terms of improved academic
performance. Positive correlations were found between study grades/output and
both the frequency and severity of hangovers experienced before COVID-19,
suggesting that heavier drinkers, in particular, improved academic performance
during the lockdown periods. In conclusion, COVID-19 lockdowns were associated
with a significant reduction in both alcohol consumption and experiencing
hangovers, which was, among heavier drinkers particularly, associated with
significantly improved academic functioning.
