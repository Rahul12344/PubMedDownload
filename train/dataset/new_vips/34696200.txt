Data about the long-term duration of antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are 
still scarce and are important to design vaccination strategies. In this study,
231 healthcare professionals received the two-dose regimen of BNT162b2. Of these,
158 were seronegative and 73 were seropositive at baseline. Samples were
collected at several time points. The neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and
antibodies against the nucleocapsid and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were
measured. At day 180, a significant antibody decline was observed in seronegative
(-55.4% with total antibody assay; -89.6% with IgG assay) and seropositive
individuals (-74.8% with total antibody assay; -79.4% with IgG assay). The
estimated half-life of IgG from the peak humoral response was 21 days (95% CI:
13-65) in seronegative and 53 days (95% CI: 40-79) in seropositive individuals.
The estimated half-life of total antibodies was longer and ranged from 68 days
(95% CI: 54-90) to 114 days (95% CI: 87-167) in seropositive and seronegative
individuals, respectively. The decline of NAbs was more pronounced (-98.6%) and
around 45% of the subjects tested were negative at day 180. Whether this decrease
correlates with an equivalent drop in the clinical effectiveness against the
virus would require appropriate clinical studies.
