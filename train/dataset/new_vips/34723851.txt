OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess failure after treatment of
high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) by HIV status and human
papillomavirus (HPV) type.
DESIGN: A population-based register study.
METHODS: The Swedish National HIV Registry, the Swedish Population Registry and
the Swedish National Cervical Screening Registry were linked to identify all
women in Stockholm and Gothenburg counties (Sweden) living with HIV and diagnosed
with CIN2+ sometime between 1983 and 2014 (n = 179). HIV-negative controls with
CIN2+, were matched (2 : 1) for country of birth. CIN2+ biopsies were retrieved
from biobanks and genotyped. Absolute risk and adjusted odds ratios (adjOR) of
treatment failure by HIV status given HPV type (HPV16/18 vs. non-HPV16/18) were
calculated.
RESULTS: HPV16 (32%) and HPV35 (24%) dominated in women living with HIV (WLWH)
with failure, HPV35 mainly in women born in sub-Saharan Africa (67%). The
absolute risk of failure in women with HPV16/18 was 26% [95% confidence interval 
(95% CI) 14-44] in WLWH and 12% in HIV-negative (95% CI 7-19). The absolute risk 
of failure in women with non-HPV16/18 was 20% (95% CI 12-31) in WLWH and 5% in
HIV-negative (95% CI 2-11). WLWH with non-HPV16/18 were six times more likely to 
fail than HIV-negative (adjOR 6.1, 95% CI 2.0-18.6).
CONCLUSION: HPV35, not included in current HPV vaccines, was the second most
common type in WLWH with failure. WLWH with non-HPV16/18 were six times more
likely to fail than HIV-negative. This could have implications for surveillance
and vaccination post CIN2+ treatment, particularly in WLWH from sub-Saharan
Africa.
