Epidemiology of COVID-19: What Changed in One Year?

Bulut C, Kato Y.

A coronavirus brought the first pandemic attack of this century as a flu virus
did a hundred years ago. This greatest pandemic of the century brings us new
opportunities to understand and explore dynamics of a contagious disease. Nearly 
two year later we are still collecting the evidence to understand the disease.
Some basic epidemiological properties are still urgently needed. Not only origin 
of the virus but also Ro value, possible transmission routes, epidemiologic
curves, case fatality rates, seasonality, severity and mortality risk factor,
effects on the risk groups, differences between countries and so on still require
strong evidence prior to making final suggestions. In this review, we tried to
evaluate epidemiological evidence to scrutinize where exactly we are in this
pandemic.
