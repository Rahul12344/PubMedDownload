The detection of antibody to non-structural protein (NSP) of Foot-and-mouth
disease virus (FMDV) is the reliable diagnostic method for differentiating
infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). For this purpose, the detection of
antibodies to non-structural 3ABC protein is suitable for identification of virus
activity in the animals exposed to FMDV infection. However, large-scale
production of recombinant 3ABC protein is challenging due to the formation of
inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and low yield due to protein aggregation
during in vitro refolding. In this study, 3ABC gene was fused with SUMO (small
ubiquitin-like modifiers) fusion system which significantly enhanced expression
of recombinant 3ABC protein in E. coli. The solubility of the recombinant
6xHis-SUMO 3ABC fusion protein was improved by mild detergent treatment and
purified through Ni-NTA chromatography under non-denaturing conditions which
yielded 9 mg protein obtained from 1-L bacterial fermentation culture. The
diagnostic potential of recombinant 3ABC protein was also tested by ELISA that
provided reliable diagnostic performance (DSn = 92%, DSp = 94%) upon comparison
with commercially available kit. The thermal stability of fusion protein was also
tested which presented reliable performance at different temperatures. In
conclusion, we presented SUMO fusion for the enhanced expression in E. coli and
purification of active recombinant 3ABC protein using non-denaturing conditions
without refolding steps. This protein can be used as a suitable diagnostic
antigen to detect antibodies following FMDV infection.
