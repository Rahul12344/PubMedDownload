Comment on
    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 May 25;118(21):.

Zhang et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 118:e2105968118, 2021) recently reported that
SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be retrotranscribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells
by the L1 retrotransposon machinery. This phenomenon could cause persistence of
viral sequences in patients and may explain the prolonged PCR-positivity of
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, even long after the phase of active virus
replication has ended. This commentary does critically review the available data 
on this topic and discusses them in the context of findings made for other
exogenous viruses and ancestral endogenous retroviral elements.
