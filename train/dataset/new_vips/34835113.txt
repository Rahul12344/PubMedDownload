Feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) is endemic in captive cheetahs and sporadically
causes devastating disease. Modified live vaccines (MLV), intended for use in
domestic cats, are used in some captive cheetah populations and have been
anecdotally linked to disease in certain subpopulations. Ten FHV-1 isolates from 
ten captive cheetahs and one isolate from an MLV used to inoculate four of the
host animals were analyzed. Viral DNA was extracted for full-genome sequencing by
Illumina MiSeq with viral genomes then used for phylogenomic and recombinational 
analyses. The FHV-1 shed by vaccinated cheetahs were almost identical to the MLV,
with few variants among viral genomes. Eight cheetah FHV-1 isolates and the MLV
were grouped in a clade along with FHV-1 isolates from domestic cats in the USA. 
The remaining two cheetah FHV-1 isolates (unknown host vaccine status) were not
associated with a clade. The likely ancestral origin of these two isolates
involves recombination events between Australian domestic cat and cheetah FHV-1
isolates. Collectively, these data suggest that the MLV is capable of causing
clinical disease and viral shedding in some cheetahs and represents evidence of
interspecies transmission of virus between domestic and wild cats.
