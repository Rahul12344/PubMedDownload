Background: Atherosclerosis (AS) is a type of yellow substance containing
cholesterol in the intima of large and middle arteries, which is mostly caused by
fat metabolism disorders and neurovascular dysfunction.
Materials and Methods: The GSE100927 data got analyzed to find out the
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package in R software. Gene
Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of 
the DEGs were assessed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
Genes (STRING) visualized the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network of the
aggregated DEGs. GSEA software was used to verify the biological process.
Result: We screened 1574 DEGs from 69 groups of atherosclerotic carotid artery
and 35 groups of control carotid artery, including 1033 upregulated DEGs and 541 
downregulated DEGs. DEGs of AS were chiefly related to immune response,
Epstein-Barr virus infection, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and cGMP-PKG
signaling pathway. Through PPI networks, we found that the hub genes of AS were
PTAFR, VAMP8, RNF19A, VPRBP, RNF217, KLHL42, NEDD4, SH3RF1, UBE2N, PJA2, RNF115, 
ITCH, SKP1, FBXW4, and UBE2H. GSEA analysis showed that GSE100927 was
concentrated in RIPK1-mediated regulated necrosis, FC epsilon receptor fceri
signaling, Fceri-mediated NF KB activation, TBC rabgaps, TRAF6-mediated induction
of TAK1 complex within TLR4 complex, and RAB regulation of trafficking.
Conclusion: Our analysis reveals that immune response, Epstein-Barr virus
infection, and so on were major signatures of AS. PTAFR, VAMP8, VPRBP, RNF217,
KLHL42, and NEDD4 might facilitate the AS tumorigenesis, which could be new
biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy of AS.
