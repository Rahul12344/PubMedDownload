Jersey Counties.

We developed an index for use by New Jersey counties to measure West Nile virus
(WNV) transmission risk to the human population. We used a latent profile
analysis to develop the index, identifying categories of environmental conditions
associated with WNV transmission risk to humans. The final model included 4
indicators of transmission risk: mosquito abundance and minimum field infection
rate, temperature, and human case count. We used data from 2004 to 2018 from all 
21 New Jersey counties aggregated into 11 2-wk units per county per year (N =
3,465). Three WNV risk classes were identified. The Low Risk class had low levels
of all variables. The Moderate Risk class had high abundance, average temperature
levels, and low levels of the other variables. The High Risk class had
substantially above average human case likelihood, average temperature, and high 
mosquito infection rates. These results suggest the presence of 3 distinct WNV
risk profiles, which can be used to guide the development of public health
actions intended to mitigate WNV transmission risk to the human population.
