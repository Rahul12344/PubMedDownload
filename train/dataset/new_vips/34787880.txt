The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has created
the current pandemic, has caused a worldwide worry. Different countries have
since enforced varying levels of lockdowns and guidelines for their populations
to follow in a serious effort to mitigate the spread. Up until recently, the
majority of these regulations and policies were established on the assumption
that the dominant routes of transmission of this virus are through droplets and
fomite contact. However, there is now a substantial amount of research pointing
towards the strong possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through airborne means.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) have recently recognized this, which poses the question of
whether our collective methods of lessening transmission risk and keeping people 
safe have been sufficient. This paper is a comprehensive review of the evidence
on SARS-CoV-2 being an airborne disease, through different epidemiological,
experimental, and animal-model based published research. Studies opposing this
evidence have also been discussed. The majority of these studies are favoring the
high plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, and therefore the many
implications of aerosol transmission have been discussed in this paper to suggest
effective mitigation and control strategies.
