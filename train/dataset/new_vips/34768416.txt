The recent respiratory virus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths
worldwide, causing great uncertainty due to the lack of a specific treatment,
which has been mitigated by the use of various drugs traditionally used against
other types of pathologies. Pregnancy presents special physiological conditions
that expose the pregnant woman and the foetus to greater risk. Pregnant women are
often excluded from trials due to possible risk of toxicity or side effects,
resulting in a lack of knowledge about the use of drugs and treatments during
pregnancy. The main objective of this review was to compile existing knowledge
about currently available drug treatments for COVID-19 in pregnant women. The
review report met the criteria of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) review protocol and was registered with the
registration number CRD42021251036. The electronic databases searched were
Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL and SciELO. Finally, 22 articles were included, resulting 
in an analysis of drugs with an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of
pregnant women with COVID-19.
