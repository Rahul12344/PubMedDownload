Some patients even 4 weeks after Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain to
be symptomatic and are known as "long-COVID". In the present study we performed
the follow up evaluation at 3 months of long-COVID patients, after treatment with
systemic steroids. During the study duration, out of the 4,542 patients managed
in the outpatient department of the particular unit, there were 49 patients of
Long-COVID. The patients having abnormal computed tomography (CT) alongwith
resting hypoxia or exertional desaturation were treated with systemic steroid
(deflazacort) in tapering doses for 8-10 weeks. We retrospectively analysed the
clinical and radiological findings of these patients at first presentation and at
about 3 months of follow up visit. On follow up, all the 49 long-COVID patients
showed improvement. The occurrence of breathlessness decreased from 91.83% to
44.89% (p<0.001) and cough from 77.55% to 8.16% (p<0.001). Twenty-four patients
were prescribed systemic steroids. Out of these, nearly 58% patients had MMRC
grade 4 breathlessness, which decreased to < 2 MMRC in about 86% of these
patients. MMRC grade (median) decreased from 3 to 1 (p<0.001). Majority of
patients who were tachypnoeic and hypoxic at rest (n=7) showed improvement (71%),
post-treatment with corticosteroids. Occurrence of normal chest X-ray increased
from 12% to 71% (p<0.001). All these patients had abnormal CT thorax initially,
and post-treatment 25% had normal CT thorax. Hence, we conclude that systemic
steroids are helpful in hastening recovery of select subset of long-COVID
patients. Simultaneously, we should be cautious of immunosuppressive effects of
steroids like tuberculosis reactivation, especially in tuberculosis endemic
countries. These findings have therapeutic implications and may serve as guidance
for future approach to the management of 'long-COVID' with pulmonary sequalae.
