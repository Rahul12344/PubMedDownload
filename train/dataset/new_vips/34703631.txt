The World Health Organization verified that Singapore had eliminated endemic
transmission of measles in October 2018. This report summarizes the evidence
presented to the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella
Elimination, comprising information about immunization schedules; laboratory
testing protocols and the surveillance system; and data on immunization coverage 
and the epidemiology of cases. Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 246 laboratory
confirmed cases of measles were reported. The source or country of infection was 
unknown for most cases (195; 79.3%). There were 22 clusters, ranging from two to 
five cases. The most common genotypes detected were D8 and D9. Transmission of B3
was interrupted in 2017, and H1 cases were sporadic and imported. Phylogenetic
analyses of the D8 isolates showed the existence of 13 lineages or clusters.
Although a few lineages were circulating concurrently, no lineage propagated
continuously for a prolonged period, and transmission of each lineage eventually 
stopped. Although cases and clusters were reported yearly, molecular data showed 
that none of the lineages resulted in prolonged transmission. There were fewer
measles cases in 2017 compared with 2016. The higher number of clusters was
likely due to the overall increase in cases because cluster sizes remained small.
The occurrence of small clusters is not unexpected since measles is highly
infectious. The majority of imported cases did not result in secondary
transmission. With the global increase in the number of measles cases, Singapore 
needs to stay vigilant and continue to promptly test suspected cases; vaccination
is the key to preventing infection.
