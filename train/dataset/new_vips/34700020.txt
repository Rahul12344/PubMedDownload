BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 a decrease of emergency
consultations and modification in treatment of numerous medical conditions were
observed. Aim of this paper was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
on incidence, treatment strategies, severity, length of hospital stay and time of
presentation in adults and children with acute appendicitis.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases 
was performed, and eligible studies used to perform a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: 46 suitable studies were identified with an overall reduction of
appendicitis cases by 20.9% in adults and an increase of 13.4% in children. The
rate of open appendectomies increased without statistical significance in both
groups (adults: 8.5% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.32; children: 7.1% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.13),
whereas the rate of antibiotic treatment increased significantly (P = 0.007;
P = 0.03). Higher rates of complicated appendicitis were observed in adults
(adults: OR 2.00, P < 0.0001; children: OR 1.64, P = 0.12). Time to first
consultation did not change significantly (adults: 52.3 vs. 38.5 h - P = 0.057;
children: 51.5 vs. 32.0 h - P = 0.062) and length of stay was also not lengthened
during the pandemic (adults: 2.9 vs. 2.7 days, P = 0.057; children: 4.2 vs. 3.7
days, P = 0.062).
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 had major impact on incidence and
treatment strategies of acute appendicitis. Results of this meta-analysis might
be another hint to support the theory that appendicitis is not a progressive
disease and surgeons can safely consider antibiotic therapy for acute
uncomplicated appendicitis.
