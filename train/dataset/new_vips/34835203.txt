The central nervous system (CNS) is highly compartmentalized and serves as a
specific site of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Therefore, an
understanding of the cellular populations that are infected by HIV or that harbor
latent HIV proviruses is imperative in the attempts to address cure strategies,
taking into account that HIV infection and latency in the CNS may differ
considerably from those in the periphery. HIV replication in the CNS is reported 
to persist despite prolonged combination antiretroviral therapy due to the
inability of the current antiretroviral drugs to penetrate and cross the
blood-brain barrier. Consequently, as a result of sustained HIV replication in
the CNS even in the face of combination antiretroviral therapy, there is a high
incidence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). This article,
therefore, provides a comprehensive review of HIV transcriptional regulation,
latency, and therapy in the CNS.
