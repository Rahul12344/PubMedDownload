The ubiquitously-expressed proteolytic enzyme furin is closely related to the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore represents a key target for antiviral
therapy. Based on bioinformatic analysis and pseudovirus tests, we discovered a
second functional furin site located in the spike protein. Furin still increased 
the infectivity of mutated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in 293T-ACE2 cells when the
canonical polybasic cleavage site (682-686) was deleted. However, K814A mutation 
eliminated the enhancing effect of furin on virus infection. Furin inhibitor
prevented infection by 682-686-deleted SARS-CoV-2 in 293T-ACE2-furin cells, but
not the K814A mutant. K814A mutation did not affect the activity of TMPRSS2 and
cathepsin L but did impact the cleavage of S2 into S2' and cell-cell fusion.
Additionally, we showed that this functional furin site exists in RaTG13 from bat
and PCoV-GD/GX from pangolin. Therefore, we discovered a new functional furin
site which is pivotal in promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
