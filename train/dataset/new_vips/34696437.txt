The 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic illustrates the impact of flaviviruses as
emerging human pathogens. For unknown reasons, ZIKV replicates more efficiently
in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) than in postmitotic neurons. Here, we
identified host factors used by ZIKV using the NCI-60 library of cell lines and
COMPARE analysis, and cross-analyzed this library with two other libraries of
host factors with importance for ZIKV infection. We identified BAF45b, a subunit 
of the BAF (Brg1/Brm-associated factors) protein complexes that regulate
differentiation of NPCs to post-mitotic neurons. ZIKV (and other flaviviruses)
infected HAP1 cells deficient in expression of BAF45b and other BAF subunits less
efficiently than wildtype (WT) HAP1 cells. We concluded that subunits of the BAF 
complex are important for infection of ZIKV and other flavivirus. Given their
function in cell and tissue differentiation, such regulators may be important
determinants of tropism and pathogenesis of arthropod-borne flaviviruses.
