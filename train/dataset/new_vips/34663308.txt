BACKGROUND: As the global strategies to fight the SARS-COV-2 infection (COVID-19)
evolved, response strategies impacted the magnitude and distribution of
health-related expenditures. Although the economic consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic has been dire, and its true scale is yet to be ascertained, one key
component of the response is the management of infected persons which its cost
has not been adequately examined, especially in Africa.
METHODS: To fill gaps in context-specific cost of treating COVID-19 patients, we 
adopted a health system's perspective and a bottom-up, point of care resource use
data collection approach to estimate the cost of clinical management of COVID-19 
infection in Ghana. The analysis was based on the national protocol for
management of COVID-19 patients at the time, whether in public or private
settings. No patients were enrolled into the study as it was entirely a
protocol-based cost of illness analysis.
RESULT: We found that resource use and average cost of treatment per COVID-19
case varied significantly by disease severity level and treatment setting. The
average cost of treating COVID-19 patient in Ghana was estimated to be US$11,925 
(GH¢68,929) from the perspective of the health system; ranging from US$282
(GH¢1629) for patients with mild/asymptomatic disease condition managed at home
to about US$23,382 (GH¢135,149) for critically ill patients requiring
sophisticated and specialised care in hospitals. The cost of treatment increased 
by some 20 folds once a patient moved from home management to the treatment
centre. Overheard costs accounted for 63-71% of institutionalised care compared
to only 6% for home-based care. The main cost drivers in overhead category in the
institutionalised care were personal protective equipment (PPEs) and
transportation, whilst investigations (COVID-19 testing) and staff time for
follow-up were the main cost drivers for home-based care.
CONCLUSION: Cost savings could be made by early detection and effective treatment
of COVID-19 cases, preferably at home, before any chance of deterioration to the 
next worst form of the disease state, thereby freeing up more resources for other
aspects of the fight against the pandemic. Policy makers in Ghana should thus
make it a top priority to intensify the early detection and case management of
COVID-19 infections.
