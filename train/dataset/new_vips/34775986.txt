Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare CD30-expressing T-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Risk of systemic ALCL is highly increased among
immunosuppressed individuals. Because risk of cancers associated with viruses is 
increased with immunosuppression, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of systemic
ALCL to determine whether a known or novel pathogen is associated with this
malignancy. Total RNA was extracted and sequenced from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 19 systemic ALCL cases (including one case
from an immunosuppressed individual with human immunodeficiency virus infection),
3 Epstein-Barr virus positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) occurring
in solid organ transplant recipients (positive controls), and 3 breast cancers
(negative controls). We used a pipeline based on the Genome Analysis Toolkit
(GATK)-PathSeq algorithm to subtract out human RNA reads and map the remaining
RNA reads to microbes. No microbial association with ALCL was identified, but we 
found Epstein-Barr virus in the DLBCL positive controls and determined the breast
cancers to be negative. In conclusion, we did not find a pathogen associated with
systemic ALCL, but because we analyzed only one ALCL tumor from an
immunosuppressed person, we cannot exclude the possibility that a pathogen is
associated with some cases that arise in the setting of immunosuppression.
