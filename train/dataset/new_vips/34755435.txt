The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has induced a large number of
deaths worldwide. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor
for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to infect the host cells. Therefore,
ACE2 may be an important target for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The
aim of this study was to investigate the inhibition effect of valaciclovir
hydrochloride (VACV), zidovudine (ZDV), saquinavir (SQV), and efavirenz (EFV) on 
2019-nCoV infection. The results of molecule docking and surface plasmon
resonance showed that VACV, ZDV, SQV, and EFV could bind to ACE2 protein, with
the KD value of (4.33 ± 0.09) e-8 , (6.29 ± 1.12) e-6 , (2.37 ± 0.59) e-5 , and
(4.85 ± 1.57) e-5 M, respectively. But only ZDV and EFV prevent the 2019-nCoV
spike pseudotyped virus to enter ACE2-HEK293T cells with an EC50 value of
4.30 ± 1.46 and 3.92 ± 1.36 μM, respectively. ZDV and EFV also have a synergistic
effect on preventing entry of virus into cells. In conclusion, ZDV and EFV
suppress 2019-nCoV infection of ACE2-HEK293T cells by interacting with ACE2.
