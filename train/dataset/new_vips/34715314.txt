OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine against
the SARS-Cov-2 Beta variant.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Israel's mass vaccination program, using two doses of
the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine, successfully curtailed the Alpha variant outbreak
during winter 2020-2021, However, the virus may mutate and partially evade the
immune system. To monitor this, sequencing of selected positive swab samples of
interest was initiated. Comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated PCR positive
persons, we estimated the odds ratio for a vaccinated case to have the Beta vs.
the Alpha variant, using logistic regression, controlling for important
confounders.
RESULTS: There were 19 cases of Beta variant (3.2%) among those vaccinated more
than 14 days before the positive sample and 79 (3.4%) among the unvaccinated. The
estimated odds ratio was 1.26 (95% CI: 0.65-2.46). Assuming the effectiveness
against the Alpha variant to be 95%, the estimated effectiveness against the Beta
variant was 94% (95% CI: 88%-98%).
CONCLUSION: Despite concerns over the Beta variant, the BNT162b2 vaccine seemed
to provide substantial immunity against both the Beta and the Alpha variants.
From 14 days following the second vaccine dose, the effectiveness of BNT162b2
vaccine was at most marginally affected by the Beta variant.
