Adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remains critical to curtail
the spread of COVID-19. Using self-reported adherence to NPIs in Canada, assessed
through a national cross-sectional survey of 4498 respondents, we aimed to
identify and characterize non-adopters of NPIs, evaluating their attitudes and
behaviours to understand barriers and facilitators of adoption. A cluster
analysis was used to group adopters separately from non-adopters of NPIs.
Associations with sociodemographic factors, attitudes towards COVID-19 and the
public health response were assessed using logistic regression models comparing
non-adopters to adopters. Of the 4498 respondents, 994 (22%) were clustered as
non-adopters. Sociodemographic factors significantly associated with the
non-adoption cluster were: (1) being male, (2) age 18-34 years, (3) Albertans,
(4) lower education level and (5) higher conservative political leaning.
Participants who expressed low concern for COVID-19 and distrust towards several 
institutions had greater odds of being non-adopters. This information
characterizes individuals at greatest odds for non-adoption of NPIs to inform
targeted marketing interventions.
