BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic has markedly
restricted endoscopic and clinical activities in gastroenterology (GI), with a
negative impact on trainee education. We aimed to inve stigate how and to what
extent has GI trainees in Turkey are affected by the current pandemic in terms of
general, psychological, and educational status.
METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey sent electronically to 103 official GI
trainees in Turkey from 37 centers. The 32-item survey included questions to
capture demographic (5-questions), endoscopic (7-questions), personal protective 
equipment (PPE) (3-questions), psychological and general well-being
(11-questions), and educational (6-questions) data.
RESULTS: Ninety-six (93.2%) trainees completed the survey, of which 56.3% (n =
54) reported a decrease in independently performed endoscopic procedures. Due to 
pandemic, 91.7% of standard diagnostic endoscopic procedures, 57.2% of standard
therapeutic procedures, and 67.7% of advanced endoscopic procedures were
decreased. Out of 96 respondents, we detected signs of anxiety in 88.5%, exposure
concern in 92.7%, concerns for prolongation of training period in 49%, loss of
concentration and interest in 47.9%, and burnout syndrome in 63.5%. Female gender
(odds-ratio: 3.856, 95% confidence interval: 1.221-12.174, P = .021) was the only
independently associated factor with pandemic-related anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has led to high amounts of anxiety and
non-negligible rates of burnout syndrome among GI trainees, with a significant
reduction in endoscopic activities. More effort and novel strategies are required
to deliver sufficient competence and general-psychological well-being to GI
trainees.
