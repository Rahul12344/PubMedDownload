The high-risk α-type papillomaviruses have a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PBM)
on one of the two major oncoproteins E6 or E7; the vast majority on E6. The PBM
is essential for the high-risk HPV life cycle, for episomal maintenance of the
virus genome, and for maintaining the mitotic stability of the infected cell. The
question is why only these viruses have PBMs - are there specific constraints
imposed by the mucosal epithelium in which these viruses replicate? However the
low-risk α-HPVs, such as HPV-6 and HPV-11 replicate extremely efficiently without
a PBM, while viruses of the alpha8 group, such as HPV-40, replicate well with a
very primitive PBM. So what does PDZ-binding capacity contribute to the fitness
of the virus?
