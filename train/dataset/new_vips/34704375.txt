BACKGROUND: Antiviral treatment is recommended for all hospitalized children with
suspected or confirmed influenza, regardless of their risk profile. Few data
exist on adherence to these recommendations, so we sought to determine factors
associated with influenza testing and antiviral treatment in children.
METHODS: Hospitalized children <18 years of age with acute respiratory illness
(ARI) were enrolled through active surveillance at pediatric medical centers in
seven cities between 11/1/2015 and 6/30/2016; clinical information was obtained
from parent interview and chart review. We used generalized linear mixed-effects 
models to identify factors associated with influenza testing and antiviral
treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 2299 hospitalized children with ARI enrolled during one influenza
season, 51% (n = 1183) were tested clinically for influenza. Clinicians provided 
antiviral treatment for 61 of 117 (52%) patients with a positive influenza test
versus 66 of 1066 (6%) with a negative or unknown test result. In multivariable
analyses, factors associated with testing included neuromuscular disease
(aOR = 5.35, 95% CI [3.58-8.01]), immunocompromised status (aOR = 2.88, 95% CI
[1.66-5.01]), age (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.91-0.96]), private only versus public
only insurance (aOR = 0.78, 95% CI [0.63-0.98]), and chronic lung disease
(aOR = 0.64, 95% CI [0.51-0.81]). Factors associated with antiviral treatment
included neuromuscular disease (aOR = 1.86, 95% CI [1.04, 3.31]),
immunocompromised state (aOR = 2.63, 95% CI [1.38, 4.99]), duration of illness
(aOR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.84, 0.99]), and chronic lung disease (aOR = 0.60, 95% CI
[0.38, 0.95]).
CONCLUSION: Approximately half of children hospitalized with influenza during the
2015-2016 influenza season were treated with antivirals. Because antiviral
treatment for influenza is associated with better health outcomes, further
studies of subsequent seasons would help evaluate current use of antivirals among
children and better understand barriers for treatment.
