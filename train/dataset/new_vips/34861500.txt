To dispose of the medical waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new
type of mobile emergency incinerator (MEI) was used in Huoshenshan Hospital,
Wuhan, China, and consequently, it produced a number of medical bottom ashs
(MBAs). In this study, the characterization and environmental risk evaluation of 
these MBAs were conducted to evaluate the disposal effect of this MEI used during
the pandemic. Three types of leaching tests, EN 12457-2, TCLP 1311, and HJ/T
299-2007, were compared to investigate the release behaviors of major and trace
elements from these MBAs. Lack of detection of COVID-19 in MBAs showed that this 
mobile emergency incinerator could thoroughly eliminate the COVID-19 virus in
medical wastes to avoid secondary transmission. The results indicated that the
increasing usage of chlorinated disinfectants and physiological saline solutions 
resulted in high Cl contents in MBAs. In addition, the increasing usage of
polypropylene (PP) products changed the chemical properties and compositions of
MBAs, with Ca as the main element. The leachability investigation revealed that
the main metals in leachates were Ca, Na and K, and the toxic heavy metals such
as Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cr in MBAs were difficult to extract because of the high pH
(>12) of these MBAs. This study could provide consultation for the treatment and 
management of MBAs produced from MEIs dealing with emergent infectious diseases
such as COVID-19.
