We have recently reported that a recombinant HIV-1NL4.3 containing Met-to-Ile
change at codon 50 of integrase (IN) (IN:M50I) exhibits suppression of the virus 
release below 0.5% of WT HIV, and the released viral particles are
replication-incompetent due to defects in Gag/GagPol processing by inhibition of 
the initiation of autoprocessing of GagPol polyproteins in the virions and leads 
to replication-incompetent viruses. The coexisting Ser-to-Asn change at codon 17 
of IN or Asn-to-Ser mutation at codon 79 of RNaseH (RH) compensated the defective
IN:M50I phenotype, suggesting that both IN and RH regulate an HIV infectability. 
In the current study, to elucidate a distribution of the three mutations during
anti-retroviral therapy among patients, we performed a population analysis using 
529 plasma virus RNA sequences obtained through the MiSeq. The result
demonstrated that 14 plasma HIVs contained IN:M50I without the compensatory
mutations. Comparing the sequences of the 14 viruses with that of the defective
virus illustrated that only Val-to-Ile change at codon 151 of IN (IN:V151I)
existed in the recombinant virus. This IN:V151I is known as a polymorphic
mutation and was derived from HIVNL4.3 backbone. A back-mutation at 151 from
Ile-to-Val in the defective virus recovered HIV replication capability, and
Western Blotting assay displayed that the back-mutation restored Gag/GagPol
processing in viral particles. These results demonstrate that a combination of
IN:M50I and IN:V151I mutations, but not IN:M50I alone, produces a defective
virus.
