Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in Brazil, few studies have been
published analysing the variability of viral genome. Herein, we described the
dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Brazil from May to September 2020,
to better understand viral changes that may affect the ongoing pandemic. Our data
demonstrate that some of the mutations identified are currently observed in
variants of interest and variants of concern, and emphasize the importance of
studying previous periods in order to comprehend the emergence of new variants.
From 720 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we found few sites under positive selection
pressure, such as the D614G (98.5 %) in the spike, that has replaced the old
variant; the V1167F in the spike (41 %), identified in the P.2 variant that
emerged from Brazil during the period of analysis; and I292T (39 %) in the N
protein. There were a few alterations in the UTRs, which was expected, however,
our data suggest that the emergence of new variants was not influenced by
mutations in UTR regions, since it maintained its conformational structure in
most analysed sequences. In phylogenetic analysis, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from 
the large urban centres to the countryside during these months could be explained
by the flexibilization of social isolation measures and also could be associated 
with possible new waves of infection. These results allow a better understanding 
of SARS-CoV-2 strains that have circulated in Brazil, and thus, with relevant
infomation, provide the potential viral changes that may have affected and/or
contributed to the current and future scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.
