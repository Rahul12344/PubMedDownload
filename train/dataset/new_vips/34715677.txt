This article aims to understand the changes in the detection rates of H5, H7, and
H9 subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in the live poultry markets (LPMs) 
in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, before and after the outbreak of the
COVID-19. From 2019 to 2020, we monitored the LPM and collected specimens, using 
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology to detect
the nucleic acid of type A AIV in the samples. The H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of
influenza viruses were further classified for positive results. We analyzed 1,959
samples before and after the outbreak and found that the positive rates of avian 
influenza A virus (39.69%) and H9 subtype (30.66%) after the outbreak were
significantly higher than before the outbreak (26.84% and 20.90%, respectively; P
< 0.001). In various LPMs, the positive rate of H9 subtypes has increased
significantly (P â‰¤ 0.001). Positive rates of the H9 subtype in duck, fecal, daub,
and sewage samples, but not chicken samples, have increased to varying degrees.
This study shows that additional measures are needed to strengthen the control of
AIVs now that LPMs have reopened after the relaxing of COVID-19-related
restrictions.
