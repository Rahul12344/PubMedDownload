PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant
morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition to those with advanced age and
co-morbidities such as heart disease or cancer, obese individuals have also had
very high rates of hospitalization, critical illness, need for ventilator
support, as well as mortality. A number of factors associated with obesity have
led to devastating consequences as these two pandemics have interacted.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obese individuals through a combination of structural and
cellular level changes have greater risk of ischemic heart disease, diabetes,
cancer, and respiratory disease, which are themselves risk-factors for acquiring 
COVID-19 disease. These structural changes also result in increased
intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic pressure as well as a restrictive lung
physiology that leads to reduction in total lung capacity, functional residual
capacity, and increase in airway hyper-reactivity. Adipose tissue is also
impacted in obese individuals leading to local as well as systemic inflammation, 
which can contribute to increased release of free fatty acids and systemic
insulin resistance. Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and dipeptidyl 
peptidase 4, which act as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 are also significantly
increased in obese individuals. The present manuscript reviews these structural, 
immune, and molecular changes associated with obesity that make obese individuals
more vulnerable to acquiring severe COVID-19 and more challenging to manage
associated complications.
