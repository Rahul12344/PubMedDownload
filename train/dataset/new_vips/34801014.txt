BACKGROUND: The global spread of COVID-19 has shown that reliable forecasting of 
public health related outcomes is important but lacking.
METHODS: We report the results of the first large-scale, long-term experiment in 
crowd-forecasting of infectious-disease outbreaks, where a total of 562 volunteer
participants competed over 15 months to make forecasts on 61 questions with a
total of 217 possible answers regarding 19 diseases.
RESULTS: Consistent with the "wisdom of crowds" phenomenon, we found that crowd
forecasts aggregated using best-practice adaptive algorithms are well-calibrated,
accurate, timely, and outperform all individual forecasters.
CONCLUSIONS: Crowd forecasting efforts in public health may be a useful addition 
to traditional disease surveillance, modeling, and other approaches to
evidence-based decision making for infectious disease outbreaks.
