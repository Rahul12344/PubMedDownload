In the literature, several HTLV-I and HIV single infections models with spatial
dependence have been developed and analyzed. However, modeling HTLV/HIV dual
infection with diffusion has not been studied. In this work we derive and
investigate a PDE model that describes the dynamics of HTLV/HIV dual infection
taking into account the mobility of viruses and cells. The model includes the
effect of Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) immunity. Although HTLV-I and HIV
primarily target the same host, CD4+T cells, via infected-to-cell (ITC) contact, 
however the HIV can also be transmitted through free-to-cell (FTC) contact.
Moreover, HTLV-I has a vertical transmission through mitosis of active
HTLV-infected cells. The well-posedness of solutions, including the existence of 
global solutions and the boundedness, is justified. We derive eight threshold
parameters which govern the existence and stability of the eight steady states of
the model. We study the global stability of all steady states based on the
construction of suitable Lyapunov functions and usage of Lyapunov-LaSalle
asymptotic stability theorem. Lastly, numerical simulations are carried out in
order to verify the validity of our theoretical results.
