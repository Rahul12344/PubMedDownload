In this observational pilot study, we investigated the impact of Dolutegravir,
Raltegravir, Elvitegravir (Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors, INSTIs), or
boosted Darunavir (a Protease Inhibitor, PI) in combination with two nucleoside
reverstranscriptase inhibitors (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil or
Lamivudine/Tenofovir disoproxil, NRTI) on four interleukins (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, 
and IL-21) as immune activation markers in naïve HIV(Human Immunodeficiency
Virus)-infected patients during the first six months of combined standard-of-care
antiretroviral therapy (cART). Newly diagnosed with HIV-infected subjects and
without any disease that could affect the immune activation markers were
evaluated. The patients' physicians recommended the cART as standard-of-care and 
the ILs were measured before cART and six months of cART. The levels of CD4+
T-cells count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio significantly increased at six months
(P-value<0.02) regardless of the drugs, INSTIs or PI. However, a CD4+/CD8+ >1 was
observed in 25% of patients treated with Raltegravir and half of those treated
with Dolutegravir. At six months of cART, viral load was detectable in only 6/31 
individuals. IL-21 had an undetectable level in 30/31 patients after six months
of cART. Our results suggest the potency in restoring immune markers in
HIV-infected patients with all investigated drugs. Dolutegravir showed a tendency
to statistically significant changes in IL-4 and IL-10. A clinical trial with
random allocation of medication and an extensive follow-up is needed to replicate
this research and validate the usefulness of evaluated ILs as markers of cART
effectiveness.
