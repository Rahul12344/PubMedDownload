In the first quarter of 2020, Italy became one of the earliest hotspots of
COVID-19 infection, and the government imposed a lockdown. During the lockdown,
an online survey of 2053 adults was conducted that asked about health behaviors
and about the psychological and overall impact of COVID-19. The present study is 
a secondary analysis of that data. We hypothesized that self-control, higher
socio-economic status, existing health conditions, and fear of infection were all
inversely related to actions (or intentions) that violated the lockdown (i.e.,
infractions). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM),
we found that only the fear of infection significantly dissuaded people from
violating lockdown rules. Since it is not practical or ethical to sow a fear of
infection, our study indicates that enacting rules and enforcing them firmly and 
fairly are important tools for containing the infection. This may become more
important as vaccines become more widely available and people lose their fear of 
infection.
