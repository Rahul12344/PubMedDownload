INTRODUCTION: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative uses polio supplementary
immunisation activities (SIAs) as a strategy to increase vaccine coverage and
cease poliovirus transmission. Impact of polio SIAs on immunisation systems is
frequently debated. We reviewed the impact of polio SIAs on routine immunisation 
and health systems during the modern era of polio eradication.
METHODS: We searched nine databases for studies reporting on polio SIAs and
immunisation coverage, financial investment, workforce and health services
delivery. We conducted a narrative synthesis of evidence. Records prior to 1994, 
animal, modelling or case studies data were excluded.
RESULTS: 20/1637 unique records were included. Data on vaccine coverage were
included in 70% (14/20) studies, workforce in 65% (13/20) and health services
delivery in 85% (17/20). SIAs positively contributed to vaccination uptake of
non-polio vaccines in seven studies, neutral in three and negative in one. Some
polio SIAs contributed to workforce strengthening through training and capacity
building. Polio SIAs were accompanied with increased social mobilisation and
community awareness building confidence in vaccination programmes. Included
studies were programmatic in nature and contained variable data, thus could not
be justly critically appraised.
CONCLUSION: Polio SIAs are successful at increasing polio vaccine coverage, but
the resources and infrastructures were not always utilised for delivery of
non-polio vaccines and integration into routine service delivery. We found a gap 
in standardised tools to evaluate SIAs, which can then inform service
integration. Our study provides data to inform SIAs evaluations, and provides
important considerations for COVID-19 vaccine roll-out to strengthen health
systems.
