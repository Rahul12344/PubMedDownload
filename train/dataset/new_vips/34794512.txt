BACKGROUND: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia (SFTS) caused by SFTS virus
(SFTSV) was a tick-borne hemorrhagic fever that posed significant threat to human
health in Eastern Asia. The study was designed to measure the seroprevalence of
SFTSV antibody in healthy population residing in a high endemic region.
METHODS: A cohort study was performed on healthy residents in Shangcheng County
in Xinyang City from April to December in 2018, where the highest SFTS incidence 
in China was reported. Anti-SFTSV IgG was measured by indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay and neutralizing antibody (NAb) was detected by using PRNT50.
The logistic regression models were performed to analyze the variables that were 
associated with seropositive rates.
RESULTS: Totally 886 individuals were recruited. The baseline seroprevalence that
was tested before the epidemic season was 11.9% (70/587) for IgG and 6.8%
(40/587) for NAb, which was increased to 13.4% (47/350) and 7.7% (27/350) during 
the epidemic season, and further to 15.8% (80/508) and 9.8% (50/508) post
epidemic. The IgG antibody-based seropositivity was significantly related to the 
patients aged ≥ 70 years old [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.440, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.334-4.461 compared to the group of < 50 years old, P = 0.004],
recent contact with cats (adjusted OR = 2.195, 95% CI: 1.261-3.818, P = 0.005),
and working in tea garden (adjusted OR = 1.698, 95% CI: 1.002-2.880, P = 0.049)
by applying multivariate logistic regression model. The NAb based seropositivity 
was similarly related to the patients aged ≥ 70 years old (adjusted OR = 2.691,
95% CI: 1.271-5.695 compared to the group of < 50 years old, P = 0.010), and
recent contact with cats (OR = 2.648, 95% CI: 1.419-4.941, P = 0.002). For a
cohort of individuals continually sampled with 1-year apart, the anti-SFTSV IgG
were maintained at a stable level, while the NAb level reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical infection might not provide adequate immunity to protect
reinfection of SFTSV, thus highlighting the ongoing threats of SFTS in endemic
regions, which called for an imperative need for vaccine development.
Identification of risk factors might help to target high-risk population for
public health education and vaccination in the future.
