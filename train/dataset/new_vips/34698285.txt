Seasonal patterns of mosquito population density and their vectorial capacity
constitute major elements to understand the epidemiology of mosquito-borne
diseases. Using adult mosquito traps, we compared the population dynamics of
major mosquito species (Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles spp.) in an
urban and a wetland rural area of Attica Greece. Pools of the captured Cx.
pipiens were analyzed to determine infection rates of the West Nile virus (WNV)
and the Usutu virus (USUV). The data provided were collected under the frame of
the surveillance program carried out in two regional units (RUs) of the Attica
region (East Attica and South Sector of Attica), during the period 2017-2018. The
entomological surveillance of adult mosquitoes was performed on a weekly basis
using a network of BG-sentinel traps (BGs), baited with CO2 and BG-Lure, in
selected, fixed sampling sites. A total of 46,726 adult mosquitoes were
collected, with larger variety and number of species in East Attica (n = 37,810),
followed by the South Sector of Attica (n = 8916). The collected mosquitoes were 
morphologically identified to species level and evaluated for their public health
importance. Collected Cx. pipiens adults were pooled and tested for West Nile
virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) presence by implementation of a targeted
molecular methodology (real-time PCR). A total of 366 mosquito pools were
analyzed for WNV and USUV, respectively, and 38 (10.4%) positive samples were
recorded for WNV, while no positive pool was detected for USUV. The majority of
positive samples for WNV were detected in the East Attica region, followed by the
South Sector of Attica, respectively. The findings of the current study highlight
the WNV circulation in the region of Attica and the concomitant risk for the
country, rendering mosquito surveillance actions and integrated mosquito
management programs as imperative public health interventions.
