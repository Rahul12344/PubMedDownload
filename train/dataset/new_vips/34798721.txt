Successful detection of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater suggests the potential utility
of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19 community surveillance. This 
systematic review aims to assess the performance of wastewater surveillance as
early warning system of COVID-19 community transmission. A systematic search was 
conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase and the WBE Consortium Registry according to
PRISMA guidelines for relevant articles published until 31st July 2021. Relevant 
data were extracted and summarized. Quality of each paper was assessed using an
assessment tool adapted from Bilotta et al.'s tool for environmental science. Of 
763 studies identified, 92 studies distributed across 34 countries were
shortlisted for qualitative synthesis. A total of 26,197 samples were collected
between January 2020 and May 2021 from various locations serving population
ranging from 321 to 11,400,000 inhabitants. Overall sample positivity was
moderate at 29.2% in all examined settings with the spike (S) gene having maximum
rate of positive detections and nucleocapsid (N) gene being the most targeted.
Wastewater signals preceded confirmed cases by up to 63 days, with 13 studies
reporting sample positivity before the first cases were detected in the
community. At least 50 studies reported an association of viral load with
community cases. While wastewater surveillance cannot replace large-scale
diagnostic testing, it can complement clinical surveillance by providing early
signs of potential transmission for more active public health responses. However,
more studies using standardized and validated methods are required along with
risk analysis and modelling to understand the dynamics of viral outbreaks.
