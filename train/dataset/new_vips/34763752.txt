BackgroundReliable testing for SARS-CoV-2 is key for the management of the
COVID-19 pandemic.AimWe estimate diagnostic accuracy for nucleic acid and
antibody tests 5 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, and compare with
manufacturer-reported accuracy.MethodsWe reviewed the clinical performance of
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and antibody tests based on 93,757 test results from 151 
published studies and 20,205 new test results from 12 countries in the European
Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA).ResultsPooling the results and
considering only results with 95% confidence interval width ≤ 5%, we found four
nucleic acid tests, including one point-of-care test and three antibody tests,
with a clinical sensitivity ≥ 95% for at least one target population
(hospitalised, mild or asymptomatic, or unknown). Nine nucleic acid tests and 25 
antibody tests, 12 of them point-of-care tests, had a clinical specificity
of ≥ 98%. Three antibody tests achieved both thresholds. Evidence for nucleic
acid point-of-care tests remains scarce at present, and sensitivity varied
substantially. Study heterogeneity was low for eight of 14 sensitivity and 68 of 
84 specificity results with confidence interval width ≤ 5%, and lower for nucleic
acid tests than antibody tests. Manufacturer-reported clinical performance was
significantly higher than independently assessed in 11 of 32 and four of 34
cases, respectively, for sensitivity and specificity, indicating a need for
improvement in this area.ConclusionContinuous monitoring of clinical performance 
within more clearly defined target populations is needed.
