Introduction: Depression is the most common mental health problem in people
living with the human immune virus. It ranges from 11% to 63% in low- and
middle-income countries. Depression was high in people living with HIV/AIDS in
developing countries, especially in the Ethiopian context. Even though depression
has negative consequences on HIV-positive patients, the care given for depression
in resource-limited countries like Ethiopia is below the standard in their HIV
care programs.
Method: International databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Hinari, Embase, and
Scopus) and Ethiopian university repository online have been covered in this
review. Data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and analyzed by using the Stata
version 14 software program. We detected the heterogeneity between studies using 
the I 2 test. We checked publication bias using a funnel plot test.
Results: The overall pooled depression prevalence among adult HIV/AIDS patients
attending antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia was 36.3% (95% CI: 28.4%, 44.2%)
based on the random effect analysis. Adult HIV/AIDS patients having CD4count <
200(AOR = 5.1; 95% CI: 2.89, 8.99), widowed marital status (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI:
2.394, 5.789), medication nonadherence (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.63, 3.15), poor
social support (2.986) (95% CI: 2.139, 4.169), perceived social stigma (2.938)
(2.305, 3.743), opportunistic infections (3.010) (2.182, 4.151), and adverse drug
reactions (4.013) (1.971, 8.167) were significantly associated with depression
among adult HIV/AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy, in Ethiopia. Conclusion 
and Recommendation. The pooled depression prevalence among adult HIV/AIDS
patients attending antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia was higher than the general
population and is alarming for the government to take special consideration for
HIV-positive patients. Depression assessment for all HIV-positive patients and
integrating with mental health should be incorporated to ensure early detection, 
prevention, and treatment. Community-based and longitudinal study designs mainly 
focusing on the incidence and determinants of depression among adult HIV/AIDS
patients should be done in the future.
