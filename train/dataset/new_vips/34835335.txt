Corals are the main primary producers of coral reefs and build the
three-dimensional reef structure that provides habitat to more than 25% of all
marine eukaryotes. They harbor a complex consortium of microorganisms, including 
bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and protists, which they rely on for their
survival. The symbiosis between corals and bacteria is poorly studied, and their 
symbiotic relationships with intracellular bacteria are only just beginning to be
acknowledged. In this review, we emphasize the importance of characterizing
intracellular bacteria associated with corals and explore how successful
approaches used to study such microorganisms in other systems could be adapted
for research on corals. We propose a framework for the description,
identification, and functional characterization of coral-associated intracellular
bacterial symbionts. Finally, we highlight the possible value of intracellular
bacteria in microbiome manipulation and mitigating coral bleaching.
