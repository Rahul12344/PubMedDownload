BACKGROUND: The rapid identification of the viral load from hepatitis C virus
(HCV) in seropositive donors enables the determination of their infection
capacity and the subsequent design of a strategy to optimize the use of
direct-action antivirals (DAA) in seronegative recipients. In 2017, we designed
an optimization protocol; this study aims to assess its efficacy and safety.
METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter observational study that complies
with the Declarations of Helsinki and Istanbul. Donors were HCV seropositive. The
HCV and human immunodeficiency virus loads were immediately determined in the
donors. For viremic donors, recipients were treated with DAA for 8 weeks. For
nonviremic donors, DAA was started if a viral load was detected during the
follow-up period. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months posttransplant.
RESULTS: This study recruited 28 donors. Just over half of the donors (n = 15;
53.5%) had a nonactive history of injection drug use. Eight (22.4%) donors were
viremic, and 20 (87.6%) were nonviremic; 13 (65%) had been treated previously.
Nine grafts were ineligible for the protocol. We performed a total of 47
transplants. Procedure I (viremic donors) was performed in 13 recipients (27.7%).
Posttransplant viremia was observed in 6 participants. Posttransplant viremia was
low (<100 IU/mL) in 4 participants but high (36,000 and 138,000 IU/mL) in 2
participants who had initiated DAA after the transplant; all these patients had a
sustained viral response. Seroconversion was observed in 11 of 13 (84.6%)
patients. Procedure II (nonviremic donors) was undertaken in 34 (82.3%) patients.
No positive viral loads were observed. Seroconversion occurred in 7 of 34 (20.5%)
recipients. All recipients maintained kidney function at 6 months posttransplant,
except 1 patient with a graft that had never been functional and another patient 
who died of pancreatitis. Both patients had received kidneys from nonviremic
donors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience supports the efficacy and safety of this protocol.
