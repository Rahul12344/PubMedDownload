Viral vector-mediated gene therapies have the potential to treat many human
diseases; however, host immune responses against the vector and/or the transgene 
pose a safety risk to the patients and can negatively impact product efficacy.
Thus, novel strategies to reduce vector immunogenicity are critical for the
advancement of these therapies. T cell activation (TCA) is required for the
development of immune responses during gene therapy. We hypothesized that
modulation of TCA by incorporating a novel viral immunomodulatory factor into a
viral vector may reduce unwanted TCA and immune responses during gene therapy. To
test this hypothesis, we identified an immunomodulatory domain of the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) NS protein 5A (NS5A) protein and studied the effect of viral vectors 
expressing NS5A peptide on TCA. Lentiviral vector-mediated expression of a short 
20-mer peptide derived from the NS5A protein in human T cells was sufficient to
inhibit TCA. Synthetic 20-mer NS5A peptide also inhibited TCA in primary human T 
cells. Mechanistically, the NS5A protein interacted with Lck and inhibited
proximal TCR signaling. Importantly, NS5A peptide expression did not cause global
T cell signaling dysfunction as distal T cell signaling was not inhibited.
Finally, recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing the 20-mer
NS5A peptide reduced both the recall antigen and the TCR-mediated activation of
human T cells and did not cause global T cell signaling dysfunction. Together,
these data suggest that expression of a 20-mer NS5A peptide by an AAV vector may 
reduce unwanted TCA and may contribute to lower vector immunogenicity during gene
therapy.
