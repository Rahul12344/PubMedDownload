The purpose of this study is to build a theoretical framework to explain Korean
domestic tourists' decision-making process under COVID-19 by applying an extended
model of goal-directed behavior. The role of positive expectation of COVID-19,
the effect of mass media, and perception of government policy were considered as 
new variables in the process of tourism decision-making. The results of this
present study show that positive and negative anticipated emotion, positive
expectation, and the frequency of past behavior positively influence the desire
for travel domestically within the next three months, while the effect of mass
media negatively affected the desire for travel domestically within the next
three months. Two anticipated emotions and positive expectations were positive
antecedents of the desire for travel domestically within this year. The
anticipated emotions and the effect of mass media affected the desire to travel
domestically next year. The results of this tourist's decision-making research
will offer government, the tourism sector, and policy decision-makers better
insights for establishing tourism policy responses and create safe destinations
to help an adequate recovery and development of the tourism industry.
