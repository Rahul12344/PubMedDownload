BACKGROUND: The value of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in cardiogenic
shock, especially the combination of the ECMELLA approach (Impella combined with 
ECMO), remains controversial.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 33-year-old female patient was submitted 
to a local emergency department with a flu-like infection and febrile
temperatures up to 39 °C. The patient was tested positive for type-A influenza,
however negative for SARS-CoV-2. Despite escalated invasive ventilation,
refractory hypercapnia (paCO2: 22 kPa) with severe respiratory acidosis (pH: 6.9)
and a rising norepinephrine rate occurred within a few hours. Due to a
Horovitz-Index < 100, out-of-centre veno-venous extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (vv-ECMO)-implantation was performed. A CT-scan done because of
anisocoria revealed an extended dissection of the right vertebral artery. While
the initial left ventricular function was normal, echocardiography revealed
severe global hypokinesia. After angiographic exclusion of coronary artery
stenoses, we geared up LV unloading by additional implantation of an Impella CP
and expanded the vv-ECMO to a veno-venous-arterial ECMO (vva-ECMO). Clinically
relevant bleeding from the punctured femoral arteries resulted in massive
transfusion and was treated by vascular surgery later on. Under continued MCS,
LVEF increased to approximately 40% 2 days after the initiation of ECMELLA. After
weaning, the Impella CP was explanted at day 5 and the vva-ECMO was removed on
day 9, respectively. The patient was discharged in an unaffected neurological
condition to rehabilitation 25 days after the initial admission.
CONCLUSIONS: This exceptional case exemplifies the importance of aggressive MCS
in severe cardiogenic shock, which may be especially promising in younger
patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and potentially reversible causes of
cardiogenic shock. This case impressively demonstrates that especially young
patients may achieve complete neurological restoration, even though the initial
prognosis may appear unfavourable.
