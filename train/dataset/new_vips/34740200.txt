As of May 19, 2021, Ethiopia was among the five African countries most affected
by COVID-19. A cross-sectional design was used to assess the level of knowledge, 
perceptions, and practices of bus station workers about COVID-19 between August
25 and September 17, 2020. Face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires
were used. To identify the factors associated with the dependent variables,
simple and multiple binary logistic regression analyses were used. A P value <
0.05 was considered significant. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20
software. In this study, 427 workers from three bus stations participated.
Approximately 84.5%, 84.8%, and 81.3% of the workers had good knowledge, positive
perceptions, and good practices, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis showed that workers with a monthly income of 3,001 to 4,000 birr were
about four times more likely to have poor knowledge compared with higher income
workers. Those workers with poor knowledge were 2.4 times, and security workers
were 3.7 times, more likely to have poor practices compared with workers with
good knowledge and drivers, respectively. In conclusion, workers used in security
and those who had poor knowledge regarding COVID-19 failed to exhibit effective
preventative practices against the virus.
