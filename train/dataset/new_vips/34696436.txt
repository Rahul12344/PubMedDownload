According to various estimates, only a small percentage of existing viruses have 
been discovered, naturally much less being represented in the genomic databases. 
High-throughput sequencing technologies develop rapidly, empowering large-scale
screening of various biological samples for the presence of pathogen-associated
nucleotide sequences, but many organisms are yet to be attributed specific loci
for identification. This problem particularly impedes viral screening, due to
vast heterogeneity in viral genomes. In this paper, we present a new
bioinformatic pipeline, VirIdAl, for detecting and identifying viral pathogens in
sequencing data. We also demonstrate the utility of the new software by applying 
it to viral screening of the feces of bats collected in the Moscow region, which 
revealed a significant variety of viruses associated with bats, insects, plants, 
and protozoa. The presence of alpha and beta coronavirus reads, including the
MERS-like bat virus, deserves a special mention, as it once again indicates that 
bats are indeed reservoirs for many viral pathogens. In addition, it was shown
that alignment-based methods were unable to identify the taxon for a large
proportion of reads, and we additionally applied other approaches, showing that
they can further reveal the presence of viral agents in sequencing data. However,
the incompleteness of viral databases remains a significant problem in the
studies of viral diversity, and therefore necessitates the use of combined
approaches, including those based on machine learning methods.
