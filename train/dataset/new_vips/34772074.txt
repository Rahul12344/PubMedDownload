Nanocomposites as drug delivery systems (e.g., metal nanoparticles) are being
exploited for several applications in the biomedical field, from therapeutics to 
diagnostics. Green nanocomposites stand for nanoparticles of biocompatible,
biodegradable and non-toxic profiles. When using metal nanoparticles for drug
delivery, the question of how hazardous these "virus-sized particles" can be is
posed, due to their nanometer size range with enhanced reactivity compared to
their respective bulk counterparts. These structures exhibit a high risk of being
internalized by cells and interacting with the genetic material, with the
possibility of inducing DNA damage. The Comet Assay, or Single-Cell Gel
Electrophoresis (SCGE), stands out for its capacity to detect DNA strand breaks
in eukaryotic cells. It has huge potential in the genotoxicity assessment of
nanoparticles and respective cells' interactions. In this review, the Comet assay
is described, discussing several examples of its application in the genotoxicity 
evaluation of nanoparticles commonly administered in a set of routes (oral, skin,
inhaled, ocular and parenteral administration). In the nanoparticles boom era,
where guidelines for their evaluation are still very limited, it is urgent to
ensure their safety, alongside their quality and efficacy. Comet assay or SCGE
can be considered an essential tool and a reliable source to achieve a better
nanotoxicology assessment of metal nanoparticles used in drug delivery.
