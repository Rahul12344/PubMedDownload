BACKGROUND: A growing body of research has highlighted the negative effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health. Previous studies showed that
women have higher levels of depression, anxiety and PTSD, and worse psychological
adjustment than men, which also persisted after the earlier phase of the
pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate changes in women's psychological distress 
during the pandemic and to evaluate the factors that have a more significant
impact in predicting women's psychological distress.
METHODS: This two-wave longitudinal study (T1 = Italian first lockdown, and T2 = 
second phase, when the restrictive measures were eased) involved 893 women (Mage 
= 36.45, SD = 14.48). Participants provided demographic and health data as well
as measures of psychological distress, emotion regulation processes, and ability 
to tolerate uncertainty.
RESULTS: No significant changes were found in women's psychological distress
between T1 and T2, i.e., during and after the first lockdown. Lower social
stability status and higher maladaptive emotional coping predicted high
psychological distress.
CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that modifiable psychological variables play a
central role in predicting distress and indicated that emotion regulation
interventions might be helpful in increasing psychological resilience and
mitigating the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic within the female
population.
