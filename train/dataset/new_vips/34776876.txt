The extraorbital lacrimal glands (ELGs) secret tears to maintain a homeostatic
environment for ocular surfaces, and pheromones to mediate social interactions.
Although its distinct gender-related differences in mice and rats have been
identified, its comprehensive histology together with whole-brain neuronal
network remain largely unknown. The primary objective of the present study was to
investigate whether sex-specific differences take place in histological and
physiological perspectives. Morphological and histological data were obtained via
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining in mice and
rats of both genders. The innervating network was visualized by a pseudorabies
virus (PRV) mediated retrograde trans-multi-synaptic tracing system for adult
C57BL6/J mice of both genders. In terms of ELGs' anatomy, mice and rats across
genders both have 7 main lobes, with one exception observed in female rats which 
have only 5 lobes. Both female rats and mice generally have relatively smaller
shape size, absolute weight, and cell size than males. Our viral tracing revealed
a similar trend of innervating patterns antero-posteriorly, but significant
gender differences were also observed in the hypothalamus (HY), olfactory areas
(OLF), and striatum (STR). Brain regions including piriform area (Pir),
post-piriform transition area (TR), central amygdalar nucleus (CEA), medial
amygdalar nucleus (MEA), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), parasubthalamic nucleus
(PSTN), pontin reticular nucleus (caudal part) (PRNc), and parabrachial nucleus, 
(PB) were commonly labeled. In addition, chemical isotope labeling-assisted
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (CIL-LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) were performed to reveal the fatty
acids and metabolism of the ELGs, reflecting the relationship between pheromone
secretion and brain network. Overall, our results revealed basic properties and
the input neural networks for ELGs in both genders of mice, providing a
structural basis to analyze the diverse functions of ELGs.
