Mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved in hair cell damage caused by
noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) plays an important role in
hair cell survival by regulating mitochondrial function; however, the role of
SIRT3 in NIHL is unknown. In this study, we used 3-TYP to inhibit SIRT3 and found
that this inhibition aggravated oxidative damage in the hair cells of mice with
NIHL. Moreover, 3-TYP reduced the enzymatic activity and deacetylation levels of 
superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Subsequently, we administered adeno-associated
virus-SIRT3 to the posterior semicircular canals and found that SIRT3
overexpression significantly attenuated hair cell injury and that this protective
effect of SIRT3 could be blocked by 2-methoxyestradiol, a SOD2 inhibitor. These
findings suggest that insufficient SIRT3/SOD2 signaling leads to mitochondrial
oxidative damage resulting in hair cell injury in NIHL. Thus, ameliorating
noise-induced mitochondrial redox imbalance by intervening in the SIRT3/SOD2
signaling pathway may be a new therapeutic target for hair cell injury.
