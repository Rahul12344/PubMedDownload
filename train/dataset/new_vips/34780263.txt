HIV-1 maturation inhibitors (MIs) offer a novel mechanism of action and potential
for use in HIV-1 treatment. Prior MIs displayed clinical efficacy but were
associated with the emergence of resistance and some gastrointestinal
tolerability events. Treatment with the potentially safer next-generation MI
GSK3640254 (GSK'254) resulted in up to a 2-log10 viral load reduction in a phase 
IIa proof-of-concept study. In vitro experiments have defined the antiviral and
resistance profile for GSK'254. The compound displayed strong antiviral activity 
against a library of subtype B and C chimeric viruses containing Gag
polymorphisms and site-directed mutants previously shown to affect potency of
earlier-generation MIs, with a mean protein-binding adjusted 90% effective
concentration of 33 nM. Furthermore, GSK'254 exhibited robust antiviral activity 
against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates, with a mean EC50 of 9 nM. Mechanistic
studies established that bound GSK'254 dissociated on average 7.1-fold more
slowly from wild-type Gag virus-like particles (VLPs) compared with a
previous-generation MI. In resistance studies, the previously identified A364V
Gag region mutation was selected under MI pressure in cell culture and during the
phase IIa clinical study. As expected, GSK'254 inhibited cleavage of p25 in a
range of polymorphic HIV-1 Gag VLPs. Virus-like particles containing the A364V
mutation exhibited a p25 cleavage rate 9.3 times faster than wild-type, providing
a possible mechanism for MI resistance. The findings demonstrate that GSK'254
potently inhibits a broad range of HIV-1 strains expressing Gag polymorphisms.
