Changes in dental care use patterns due to COVID-19 among insured patients in the
United States.

Choi SE, Simon L, Basu S, Barrow JR.

BACKGROUND: Demand for dental services has been known to be linked closely to
dental insurance and disposable income. Widespread economic uncertainty and
health systems changes due to COVID-19 thus may have a significant impact on
dental care use.
METHODS: Using deidentified dental practice management data from 2019 and 2020,
the authors observed variations in dental care use among insured patients since
the COVID-19 outbreak (during the period of practice closure and after the
reopening) by patient age, procedure type, insurance type, practice size,
geographic area, and reopening status. The authors examined whether the rebound
in procedure volumes at dental practices can be explained by county-level
characteristics using hierarchical regression models.
RESULTS: Although dental care use among privately insured patients fully
rebounded by August 2020, use still remained lower than the prepandemic level by 
7.54% among the publicly insured population. Demand for teledentistry increased
60-fold during practice closure. Geographic characteristics-such as median
household income, percentages of rural or Black populations, and dental care
professional shortage designations-were associated significantly with the number 
of procedures performed at dental practices.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of COVID-19, dental practices experienced substantial
decreases in procedure volume, particularly among patients covered by public
insurance or residing in underserved areas.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: During economic downturns, state health officials should 
be encouraged to adopt policies to expand access to oral health care for
vulnerable populations via oral health promotion strategies and increasing the
supply of dentists or midlevel dental care providers in underserved areas.
