Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses, typically transmitted by mosquitoes
between vertebrate hosts. They encode four essential replication proteins, the
non-structural proteins nsP1-4, which possess the enzymatic activities of RNA
capping, RNA helicase, site-specific protease, ADP-ribosyl removal and RNA
polymerase. Alphaviruses have been key models in the study of membrane-associated
RNA replication, which is a conserved feature among the positive-strand RNA
viruses of animals and plants. We review new structural and functional
information on the nsPs and their interaction with host proteins and membranes,
as well as with viral RNA sequences. The dodecameric ring structure of nsP1 is
likely to be one of the evolutionary innovations that facilitated the success of 
the progenitors of current positive-strand RNA viruses.
