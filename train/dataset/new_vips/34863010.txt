Although SARS-CoV-2 surface contamination has been investigated in health care
settings, little is known about the SARS-CoV-2 surface contamination in public
urban areas, particularly in tropical countries. Here, we investigated the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces in a large city in Brazil, one the 
most affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. A total of 400
surface samples were collected in February 2021 in the City of Recife,
Northeastern Brazil. A total of 97 samples (24.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
by RT-qPCR using the CDC-USA protocol. All the collection sites, except one
(18/19, 94.7%) had at least one environmental surface sample contaminated.
SARS-CoV-2 positivity was higher in public transport terminals (47/84, 55.9%),
followed by health care units (26/84, 30.9%), beach areas (4/21, 19.0%), public
parks (14/105, 13.3%), supply center (2/21, 9.5%), and public markets (4/85,
4.7%). Toilets, ATMs, handrails, playground, and outdoor gym were identified as
fomites with the highest rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Taken together, our data 
provide a real-world picture of SARS-CoV-2 dispersion in highly populated
tropical areas and identified critical control points that need to be targeted to
break SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains. This article is protected by copyright. All
