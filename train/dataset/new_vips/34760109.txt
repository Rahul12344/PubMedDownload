Background: Little is known about the development of acute pancreatitis as a
complication of corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This case
report describes the presentation of acute pancreatitis in a young woman who then
was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.
Case Presentation: An 18-year old previously healthy woman referred to Imam Raza 
hospital, Tabriz, Iran with a 3-day history of intermittent and crampy abdominal 
pain. She had serum amylase of 1288 IU/L and serum lipase of 1541 IU/L. She was
diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. She was instructed nil per os (NPO) and serum 
therapy and also was given pantoprazole, and pethidine for her pain management.
The laboratory tests for assessing the etiology of acute pancreatitis were
normal. Abdominal and pelvic spiral computed tomography (CT) scan revealed
edematous pancreas and enhancing loculi fluid accumulation around pancreas along 
with the small amount of ascites fluid that all suggest acute pancreatitis. Due
to the presentation of fever and COVID-19 pandemic and her potential society
exposure, we tested SARS CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction which was positive.
The blood C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 3+ but the chest x-ray showed no
findings compatible with COVID-19. Eventually after receiving conservative
therapy for her pancreatitis, she was discharged from hospital in the good
general condition and she has not experienced any episodes of abdominal pain
again.
Conclusion: This case highlights acute pancreatitis as a suspected complication
associated with COVID-19 and the need for further research.
