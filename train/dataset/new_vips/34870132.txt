The golden hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates key
characteristics of COVID-19. In this work we examined the influence of the route 
of exposure, sex, and age on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in hamsters. We report that 
delivery of SARS-CoV-2 by a low versus high volume intranasal or intragastric
route results in comparable viral titers in the lung and viral shedding. However,
low-volume intranasal exposure results in milder weight loss while intragastric
exposure leads to a diminished capacity to regain body weight. Male hamsters, and
particularly older male hamsters, display an impaired capacity to recover from
illness and delayed viral clearance. These factors were found to influence the
nature of the host inflammatory cytokine response, but had a minimal effect on
the quality and durability of the humoral immune response and susceptibility to
re-infection. These data further elucidate key factors that impact pre-clinical
challenge studies carried out in the hamster model of COVID-19.
