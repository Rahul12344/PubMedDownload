COVID-19 is a serious infectious disease that has recently swept the world, and
research on its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, remains insufficient. Therefore,
this study uses bioinformatics analysis techniques to explore the human digestive
tract diseases that may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The gene expression
profile data set, numbered GSE149312, is from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database and is divided into a 24-h group and a 60-h group. R software is used to
analyze and screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and then gene
ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
enrichment analyses are performed. In KEGG, the pathway of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease exists in both the 24-h group and 60-h group. STRING is used to
establish a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and Cytoscape is then used
to visualize the PPI and define the top 12 genes of the node as the hub genes.
Through verification, nine statistically significant hub genes are identified:
AKT1, TIMP1, NOTCH, CCNA2, RRM2, TTK, BUB1B, KIF20A, and PLK1. In conclusion, the
results of this study can provide a certain direction and basis for follow-up
studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human digestive tract and provide new
insights for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2.
