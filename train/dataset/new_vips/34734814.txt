OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic accuracy of the 
presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) on baseline electrocardiogram on the adverse
outcome in critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: The current study was retrospective designed and included 169 patients
who were critically ill with COVID-19 and CVD (mean age of 62±15 years). The
patients were grouped into those who died (non-survivor group) and those who
survived (survivor group).
RESULTS: The non-survivors were older and more often had CVD (p=0.009),
hypertension (p=0.046), diabetes (p=0.048), cancer (p=0.023), and chronic renal
failure (p=0.001). Although the presence of fQRS on the basal electrocardiogram
was more common in patients who died, this was not statistically significant
(p=0.059). Furthermore, non-survivors had more frequent the coexistence of CVD
and fQRS (p=0.029). In Model 1 multivariate regression analysis, CVD alone was
not a predictor of mortality (p=0.078), whereas coexistence of CVD and fQRS was
found to be an independent predictor of mortality in Model 2 analysis [hazard
ratio (HR): 2.243; p=0.003]. Furthermore, older age (HR: 1.022; p=0.006 and HR:
1.023; p=0.005), cancer (HR: 1.912; p=0.021 and HR: 1.858; p=0.031), high SOFA
score (HR: 1.177; p=0.003 and HR: 1.215; p<0.001), and increased CRP level (HR:
1.003; p=0.039 and HR: 1.003; p=0.027) independently predicted the mortality in
both multivariate analysis models, respectively.
CONCLUSION: fQRS may be a useful and handy risk-stratification tool for clinical 
outcomes by identifying high-risk individuals, especially among those with CVD.
