Different mechanisms have been proposed in lymphomatous involvement of the optic 
nerve. They include isolated optic nerve lymphoma, optic nerve lymphoma
associated with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, or with systemic
lymphoma. We present one case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the optic nerve in a
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patient and discuss the mechanism of
metastasis, classification of optic nerve involvement with clinical and
radiologic features as well as treatment options. Despite the uncommon nature of 
optic nerve infiltration by lymphoma, prompt evaluation should be considered in
patients with a history of lymphoma and visual symptoms as delays in treatment
can result in permanent vision loss. The recommended initial workup includes
neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation. Treatment options are not
standardized but include intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy,
corticosteroids, and radiation.
