OBJECTIVES: This study is set up to explore the factors associated with Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing among women and men in Nepal.
STUDY DESIGN: Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 2016 adopts a cross-sectional 
design.
SETTING: Nepal.
PARTICIPANTS: Women and men of age 15-49 years.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Our primary outcome was ever tested for HIV. We used
multivariable analysis at a 95% level of significance to measure the effect in
outcome variables.
RESULTS: About one in 10 women (10.8%) and one in five men (20.5%) ever tested
for HIV. Women who had media exposure at least once a week ((adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR)=2.8; 95% CI: 1.4 to 5.3) were more likely to get tested for HIV compared
with those who had no media exposure at all. Similarly, those who had their
recent delivery in the health facility (aOR=3.9; 95% CI: 2.4 to 6.3) were more
likely to get tests for HIV compared with those delivered elsewhere. Likewise,
among men, compared with adolescents (15-19 years), those from older age groups
were more likely to get tested for HIV. Compared with no education, secondary
(aOR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.6) and higher education (aOR=1.7; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.8) 
had higher odds of getting tested for HIV. Similarly, wealth quintiles in richer 
and richest groups were more likely to get tested for HIV compared with the
poorest quintile. Other characteristics like media exposure, paid sex and 2+
sexual partners were positively associated with being tested for HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV testing is not widespread and more men than women are accessing 
HIV services. More than two-thirds of women who delivered at health facilities
never tested for HIV. It is imperative to reach out to people engaging in risky
sexual behaviour, people with lower educational attainment, and those in the
lower wealth quintile for achieving 95-95-95 targets by 2030.
