OBJECTIVE: To understand the work experiences of pharmacists in fever clinics and
isolation wards of designated hospitals for the novel coronavirus pneumonia in
China and provide the basis for work management strategies and psychological
interventions in pharmacy for prevention and control of future epidemics.
METHODS: Using qualitative research methods, 13 pharmacists who met the inclusion
criteria and worked in fever clinics and isolation wards of designated hospitals 
for novel coronavirus pneumonia attended focus group interviews and
semistructured interviews. The Colaizzi analysis method was used for data
analysis, summary and induction.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) the roles of pharmacists in fever
clinics and isolation wards in epidemic prevention and control, including
ensuring the supply of medicines, providing medication guidance for patients,
providing medication information for physicians and nurses, and participating in 
infection control; (2) the difficulties at work, including the lack of office
equipment, information equipment and other infrastructure, the difficulty of
management of pharmacists in isolation wards, challenging environments, and
insufficient attention of hospitals, medical staff, and society to pharmacists;
(3) the loopholes in drug management, including the management of special-class
drugs and national free AIDS antiviral drugs, and the retrieval of drugs.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacists have played an essential role in the fight against the
epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China. The themes and experiences
identified in this study can offer guidance to the pharmacy society in
implementing strategies to prepare for future public health events.
