An 81-year-old man presented with limb weakness and dysesthesia approximately 10 
days after eating pork liver. His neurological examination revealed muscle
weakness predominantly centered in the lower limbs and absence of deep tendon
reflex, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated proteins with normal
cell counts. Furthermore, his nerve conduction studies revealed distal motor
latency prolongation and decreased motor nerve conduction velocities in the
bilateral median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal nerves. Lastly, serological
analysis was performed for hepatitis E virus markers, resulting in a positive
result for hepatitis E virus (HEV)-IgA antibody and HEV-RNA. Given all these
findings, the patient was diagnosed with acute HEV-associated Guillain-Barré
syndrome (GBS), and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was administered for
five days. Following this, muscle weakness and dysesthesia gradually improved. As
observed in this report, the number of HEV-associated GBS cases has been
increasing over the past several years. Therefore, HEV infection should be
considered in GBS patients who have a history of pork consumption or have been
suffering from liver dysfunction.
