An Austrian organic dairy sheep farm experienced cases of recumbency and sudden
deaths in three to four week old lambs. Two animals were subjected to thorough
clinical and pathological investigations. Pathohistological analysis identified
severe nonsuppurative myelitis and mild nonsuppurative encephalitis. An RT-qPCR
assay for the recently discovered ovine picornavirus causing comparable lesions
scored negative. By next-generation sequencing-based metagenomics a nearly
complete genome of a novel enterovirus could be detected and assembled. In situ
hybridization using a specifically designed probe revealed robust signals in
affected motoneurons of the spinal cord suggesting a causative role of the novel 
virus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
