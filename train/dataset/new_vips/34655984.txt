BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is one of the major viral diseases worldwide transmitted
by mosquitoes. Depending on the severity of disease it can range from mild fever 
to severe fatal cases. Rapid decline of platelet levels is one of indicators of
clinical worsening. The role of viral factors in dengue pathogenesis and
correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters remain unclear.
METHODS: Between September 2017 to December 2018, 102 dengue confirmed paediatric
cases were analysed for various viral and host parameters. Based on symptoms,
they were classified into dengue without warning signs (DOS), dengue with warning
signs (DWS) and severe dengue (SD) as per 2009 WHO classification. Quantitative
analysis of NS1, IgM and IgG in were done by ELISA. IgM/IgG ratio revealed
primary or secondary dengue infection. Serotyping of virus in serum was done by
nested multiplex RT-PCR. Viral load (VL) was determined by quantitative real time
polymerase chain reaction. Association between VL and NS1 in patient sera with
clinical and laboratory parameters was statistically analysed.
RESULTS: It was found that disease severity (as per 2009 WHO classification)
significantly associated with secondary dengue infection. DENV3 was found to be
the only serotype detected. The present study reports neither NS1 nor VL
significantly associated with disease severity or type of infection (primary or
secondary). However, VL positively correlated with haematocrit (p < 0.05). Viral 
load above 106 copies/mL was found in 61% of patients. Further, high viral load
(>106 copies/mL) negatively correlated with platelet levels (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Thus, viral load could be an important predictive parameter in dengue
related severe symptoms like thrombocytopenia and elevated hematocrit when it
goes above a certain threshold (>106 copies/ mL).
