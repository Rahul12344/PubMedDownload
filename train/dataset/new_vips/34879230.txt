Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of respiratory
illness in infants and the elderly. Although several vaccines have been
developed, none have succeeded in part due to our incomplete understanding of the
correlates of immune protection. While both T cells and antibodies play a role,
emerging data suggest that antibody-mediated mechanisms alone may be sufficient
to provide protection. Therefore, to map the humoral correlates of immunity
against RSV, antibody responses across six different vaccines were profiled in a 
highly controlled nonhuman primate-challenge model. Viral loads were monitored in
both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and machine learning was used to
determine the vaccine platform-agnostic antibody features associated with
protection. Upper respiratory control was associated with virus-specific IgA
levels, neutralization, and complement activity, whereas lower respiratory
control was associated with Fc-mediated effector mechanisms. These findings
provide critical compartment-specific insights toward the rational development of
future vaccines.
