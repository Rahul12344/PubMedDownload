The cost of testing can be a substantial contributor to hepatitis C virus (HCV)
elimination program costs in many low- and middle-income countries such as
Georgia, resulting in the need for innovative and cost-effective strategies for
testing. Our objective was to investigate the most cost-effective testing
pathways for scaling-up HCV testing in Georgia. We developed a Markov-based model
with a lifetime horizon that simulates the natural history of HCV, and the cost
of detection and treatment of HCV. We then created an interactive online tool
that uses results from the Markov-based model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of different HCV testing pathways. We compared the current standard-of-care (SoC)
testing pathway and four innovative testing pathways for Georgia. The SoC testing
was cost-saving compared to no testing, but all four new HCV testing pathways
further increased QALYs and decreased costs. The pathway with the highest patient
follow-up, due to on-site testing, resulted in the highest discounted QALYs (123 
QALY more than the SoC) and lowest costs ($127,052 less than the SoC) per 10,000 
persons screened. The current testing algorithm in Georgia can be replaced with a
new pathway that is more effective while being cost-saving.
