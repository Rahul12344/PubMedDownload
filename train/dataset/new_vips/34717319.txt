Forecasting epidemic scenarios has been critical to many decision-makers in
imposing various public health interventions. Despite progresses in determining
the magnitude and timing of epidemics, epidemic peak time predictions for H1N1
and COVID-19 were inaccurate, with the peaks delayed with respect to predictions.
Here, we show that infection and recovery rate fluctuations play a critical role 
in peak timing. Using a susceptible-infected-recovered model with daily
fluctuations on control parameters, we show that infection counts follow a
lognormal distribution at the beginning of an epidemic wave, similar to price
distributions for financial assets. The epidemic peak time of the stochastic
solution exhibits an inverse Gaussian probability distribution, fitting the
spread of the epidemic peak times observed across Italian regions. We also show
that, for a given basic reproduction number R0, the deterministic model
anticipates the peak with respect to the most probable and average peak time of
the stochastic model. The epidemic peak time distribution allows one for a robust
estimation of the epidemic evolution. Considering these results, we believe that 
the parameters' dynamical fluctuations are paramount to accurately predict the
epidemic peak time and should be introduced in epidemiological models.
