Three major human coronavirus disease outbreaks, severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and 2019 coronavirus
disease (COVID-19), occurred in the twenty-first century and were caused by
different coronaviruses (CoVs). All these viruses are considered to have
originated from bats and transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, disease agent of COVID-19, shared around 80% genomic
similarity, and thus belong to SARS-related CoVs. As a natural reservoir of
viruses, bats harbor numerous other SARS-related CoVs that could potentially
infect humans around the world, causing SARS or COVID-19 like outbreaks in the
future. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of CoVs on
geographical distribution, genetic diversity, cross-species transmission
potential and possible pathogenesis in humans, aiming for a better understanding 
of bat SARS-related CoVs in the context of prevention and control.
