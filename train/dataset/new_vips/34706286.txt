BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is one of the underlying mechanisms to
vascular and cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19. We sought to
investigate the systemic vascular endothelial function and its temporal changes
in COVID-19 patients from a non-invasive approach with reactive hyperemia
peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT).
METHODS: This is a prospective, observational, case-control and blinded study.
The population was comprised by 3 groups: patients investigated during acute
COVID-19 (group 1), patients investigated during past COVID-19 (group 2), and
controls 1:1 matched to COVID-19 patients by demographics and cardiovascular risk
factors (group 3). The natural logarithmic scaled reactive hyperemia index
(LnRHI), a measure of endothelium-mediated dilation of peripheral arteries, was
obtained in all the participants and compared between study groups.
RESULTS: 144 participants were enrolled (72 COVID-19 patients and 72 matched
controls). Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to PAT assessment was 9.5 and
101.5 days in groups 1 and 2, respectively. LnRHI was significantly lower in
group 2 compared to both group 1 and controls (0.53 ± 0.23 group 2 vs.
0.72 ± 0.26 group 1, p = 0.0043; and 0.79 ± 0.23 in group 3, p < 0.0001). In
addition, within group 1, it was observed a markedly decrease in LnRHI from acute
COVID-19 to post infection stage (0.73 ± 0.23 vs. 0.42 ± 0.26, p = 0.0042).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a deleterious effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 
systemic vascular endothelial function. These findings open new venues to
investigate the clinical implication and prognostic role of vascular endothelial 
dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and post-COVID syndrome using non-invasive
techniques.
