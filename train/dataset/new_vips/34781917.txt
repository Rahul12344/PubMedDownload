BACKGROUND: Guidelines and recommendations from public health authorities related
to face masks have been essential in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We
assessed the prevalence and correlates of mask usage during the pandemic.
METHODS: We examined a total of 13,723,810 responses to a daily cross-sectional
online survey in 38 countries of people who completed from April 23, 2020 to
October 31, 2020 and reported having been in public at least once during the last
7 days. The outcome was individual face mask usage in public settings, and the
predictors were country fixed effects, country-level mask policy stringency,
calendar time, individual sociodemographic factors, and health prevention
behaviors. Associations were modeled using survey-weighted multivariable logistic
regression.
RESULTS: Mask-wearing varied over time and across the 38 countries. While some
countries consistently showed high prevalence throughout, in other countries mask
usage increased gradually, and a few other countries remained at low prevalence. 
Controlling for time and country fixed effects, sociodemographic factors (older
age, female gender, education, urbanicity) and stricter mask-related policies
were significantly associated with higher mask usage in public settings.
Crucially, social behaviors considered risky in the context of the pandemic
(going out to large events, restaurants, shopping centers, and socializing
outside of the household) were associated with lower mask use.
CONCLUSION: The decision to wear a face mask in public settings is significantly 
associated with sociodemographic factors, risky social behaviors, and mask
policies. This has important implications for health prevention policies and
messaging, including the potential need for more targeted policy and messaging
design.
