Purpose: To investigate long-term incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
the factors associated with HCC occurrence after achieving sustained virological 
response (SVR) by direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) treatment for hepatitis C
virus (HCV).
Methods: A total of 476 patients (male 227, female 249; median age 68) with
chronic HCV infection who were treated with DAAs and achieved SVR were analyzed. 
The incidence of HCC and factors related to the development of HCC after HCV
elimination were evaluated.
Results: The median observation period was 46.4 months. During this period, 40
patients developed HCC. The incidence rates of HCC were 3.7%, 6.0%, 7.1%, 9.3%,
and 10.6% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post-SVR12, respectively. Multivariate
analysis with pre-treatment factors revealed that platelet count, α-fetoprotein, 
fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) index, and previous HCC history were independent factors that 
contributed to development of HCC post-SVR following DAA treatment. Of these
factors, previous HCC history was the most significant, followed by Fib-4 index. 
Using these two factors, a novel scoring system was established. The presence of 
previous HCC history was scored as 2, and then, the absence of previous HCC
history was stratified by Fib-4 index (≥3.07, 1; <3.07, 0). The HCC occurrence
rate at 5 years was 0.4% in the 0-point group, 6.8% in the 1-point group, and
55.6% in the 2-point group, respectively.
Conclusion: Fib-4 index and previous HCC history were independent predictors for 
development of HCC after DAA treatment. Patients with these risk factors require 
careful observation.
