MicroRNAs (miRNAs) involved host-virus interaction, affecting the replication or 
pathogenesis of several viruses. Although avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J)
has been one of the most studied avian viruses, the effects of various host
miRNAs on ALV-J infection and its underlying molecular mechanisms are still
unclear. Here, we reported that gga-miR-200b-3p acts as a positive host factor
enhancing ALV-J replication. We found that gga-miR-200b-3p was increased in
response to ALV-J infection in host cells, and that gga-miR-200b-3p effectively
enhanced ALV-J replication via targeting host protein dual-specificity
phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Collectively, these findings highlight a crucial role of
gga-miR-200b-3p in ALV-J replication.
