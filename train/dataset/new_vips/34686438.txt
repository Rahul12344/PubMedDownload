OBJECTIVE: Despite growing expertise and wide application of venovenous
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) treatment for acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) of different origin and during pandemics (H1N1 Influenza
A virus and SARS-CoV-2), large reports are few and pertain mostly to multicenter 
registries, and randomized trials are difficult to perform. The aim of this study
was to report outcomes, trends, and innovations of VV ECMO treatment over the
last 11 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study on 142 patients treated at
the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital in Milan from June 2009 (year of the H1N1
pandemic) to May 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main causes of ARDS were H1N1 pneumonia in 36%
of patients, bacterial pneumonia in 17%, and SARS-CoV-2 in 9%. Seventy-two
percent of patients were centralized from remote hospitals, of whom 33% had
implanted VV ECMO before transport. The most common cannulation strategy was the 
dual-lumen catheter cannulation system (55%), and anticoagulation was performed
with bivalirudin in most patients (79%). Refractory hypoxia was treated with
intravenous beta-blockers (64%), nitric oxide (20%), and pronation (8%). Almost
one-third of patients (32%) were extubated while on ECMO. Forty-nine percent of
patients were discharged from the intensive care unit, and hospital discharge was
46%; survival was lower in patients requiring VV ECMO for more than three weeks
compared with shorter support duration (23% v 56%, p = 0.007). Anticoagulation
with bivalirudin was associated with higher survival, compared with heparin (55% 
v 31%, p = 0.03), and lower thrombocytopenia incidence (69% v 35%, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: VV ECMO is the pivotal rescue treatment for refractory ARDS-timely
treatment and optimal care are needed to optimize therapy, as duration of support
is associated with outcome. Anticoagulation with bivalirudin may improve outcome.
