Dengue fever is a classic mosquito viral disease. Dengue virus non-structural
protein-1 as a membrane-associated homologous dimer anchored to the surface of
infected cells and also secreted into the blood. The nonstructural protein-1
levels are related to disease severity, and the presence of nonstructural
protein-1 secreted from cells to the serum of people infected with the dengue
virus is an early marker of infection. Paired antibodies are key in the
establishment of rapid detection technology. In this study, the prepared
recombinant nonstructural protein-1 protein of dengue virus serotype 3 was
purified by the prokaryotic expression, and prepared monoclonal antibodies by
cell fusion. A method for paired antibody screening was established based on the 
N-hydroxy succinimide-nanobeads and the prepared monoclonal antibodies. A simple 
and rapid point-of-care system integrating the paired antibodies and lateral flow
assay was established to verify the screened antibody pairs. The results
confirmed that the antibody pair screening method based on N-hydroxy
succinimide-nanobeads is feasible.
