The reasons behind the clinical variability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from
asymptomatic infection to lethal disease, are still unclear. We performed
genome-wide transcriptional whole-blood RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis
and PCR validation to test the hypothesis that immune response-related gene
signatures reflecting baseline may differ between healthy individuals, with an
equally robust antibody response, who experienced an entirely asymptomatic (n=17)
versus clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=15) in the past months (mean of 14
weeks). Among 12.789 protein-coding genes analysed, we identified six and nine
genes with significantly decreased or increased expression, respectively, in
those with prior asymptomatic infection relatively to those with clinical
infection. All six genes with decreased expression (IFIT3, IFI44L, RSAD2, FOLR3, 
PI3, ALOX15), are involved in innate immune response while the first two are
interferon-induced proteins. Among genes with increased expression six are
involved in immune response (GZMH, CLEC1B, CLEC12A), viral mRNA translation
(GCAT), energy metabolism (CACNA2D2) and oxidative stress response (ENC1).
Notably, 8/15 differentially expressed genes are regulated by interferons. Our
results suggest that subtle differences at baseline expression of innate
immunity-related genes may be associated with an asymptomatic disease course in
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether a certain gene signature predicts, or not, those
who will develop a more efficient immune response upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2,
with implications for prioritization for vaccination, warrant further study.
