The spreading of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could be
associated with psychosocial implications. This study, therefore, aimed to
investigate the psychosocial disturbances before and during the COVID-19
pandemic. The cross-sectional study included 20,885 participants (12,343 females 
and 8,542 males) with psychosocial trauma who were selected by the census
sampling method from Fars province, Iran. The mean age of participants in this
study was 35.76 (7.52). The results showed that the incidence rate for
psychosocial disturbances was 150.86 and 273.69 per 100,000 cases prior to and
during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Analysis showed that reports of
spousal abuse, child abuse, elderly abuse, disability abuse, the violence of
other relatives, child labor, divorce petition, acute family dispute,
unemployment/financial problems, substance abuse, and health questions about
COVID-19 increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows
that the COVID-19 pandemic influences the increase of psychopathology and social 
pathology. Therefore, recommends a comprehensive assessment to prevent and
address the psychosocial consequences associated with COVID-19.
