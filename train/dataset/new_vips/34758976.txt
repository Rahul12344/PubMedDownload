OBJECTIVE: To identify circulating proteins influencing type 1 diabetes
susceptibility using Mendelian randomization (MR).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a large-scale two-sample MR study, using cis
genetic determinants (protein quantitative trait loci [pQTL]) of up to 1,611
circulating proteins from five large genome-wide association studies, to screen
for causal associations of these proteins with type 1 diabetes risk in 9,684 case
subjects with type 1 diabetes and 15,743 control subjects. Further,
pleiotropy-robust MR methods were used in sensitivity analyses using both cis and
trans-pQTL.
RESULTS: We found that a genetically predicted SD increase in signal regulatory
protein γ (SIRPG) level was associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes
risk (MR odds ratio [OR] 1.66 [95% 1.36-2.03]; P = 7.1 × 10-7). The risk of type 
1 diabetes increased almost twofold per genetically predicted standard deviation 
(SD) increase in interleukin-27 Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 (IL27-EBI3) protein 
levels (MR OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.48-2.62]; P = 3.7 × 10-6). However, an SD increase
in chymotrypsinogen B1 (CTRB1) was associated with decreased risk of type 1
diabetes (MR OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.77-0.90]; P = 6.1 × 10-6). Sensitivity analyses
using MR methods testing for pleiotropy while including trans-pQTL showed similar
results. While the MR-Egger suggested no pleotropic effect (P value MR-Egger
intercept = 0.31), there was evidence of pleiotropy in MR-PRESSO (P value global 
test = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified three novel circulating protein biomarkers associated 
with type 1 diabetes risk using an MR approach. These biomarkers are promising
targets for development of drugs and/or of screening tools for early prediction
of type 1 diabetes.
