The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is unprecedented in human history. As a major structural protein,
nucleocapsid protein (NPro) is critical to the replication of SARS-CoV-2. In this
work, 17 NPro-targeting phenanthridine derivatives were rationally designed and
synthesized, based on the crystal structure of NPro. Most of these compounds can 
interact with SARS-CoV-2 NPro tightly and inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2
in vitro. Compounds 12 and 16 exhibited the most potent anti-viral activities
with 50% effective concentration values of 3.69 and 2.18 μM, respectively.
Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of NPro and Surface Plasmon Resonance
(SPR) assays revealed that 12 and 16 target N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPro by
binding to Tyr109. This work found two potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 bioactive compounds
and also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 NPro-NTD can be a target for new anti-virus
agents.
