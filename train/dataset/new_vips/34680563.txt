BACKGROUND: A large amount of epidemiological evidence indicates that persistent 
HCV infection is the main risk factor for HCC. We aimed to study the effects of
persistent HCV infection on the interaction of the virus and host cell to
identify cancer gene profiles.
METHODS: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially
expressed genes between uninfected Huh7.5.1 control cells, short-term HCV
(S-HCV), early long-term HCV (eL-HCV), and long-term HCV (L-HCV) infections,
which were analyzed using different dynamic bioinformatics and analytic tools.
mRNA expression was validated and quantified using q-PCR. One hundred ninety-six 
serum samples of HCV patients with IFN/RBV treatment were used to study chemokine
levels.
RESULTS: S-HCV activates an inflammatory response and drives cell death and
apoptosis through cell cycle arrest via MAPK signaling. L-HCV promotes cell
growth and alters cell adhesion and chemokine signaling via CXCL8-mediated-SRC
regulation. A total of 196 serum samples from the HCV and HCV-HCC cohorts
demonstrated significantly upregulated pro-inflammatory CXCL8 in non-SVR
(persistent HCV infection) patients in the HCV-HCC group.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent infection with HCV induced pro-inflammatory CXCL8 and the
oncogene SRC, thereby triggering and promoting hepatocarcinogenesis. CXCL8 may be
a potential biomarker for monitoring HCV-related HCC progression.
