Voluntary asymptomatic severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
testing was provided by the NIH Clinical Center over 1 year. Among 105,927 tests,
0.2% were positive. Among eligible staff, 79% participated with variable
frequency and 61% of positive individuals had symptoms at the time of testing.
Saliva specimen collection was chosen as an option less frequently than
midturbinate collection.
