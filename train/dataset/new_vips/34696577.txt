Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most invasive and lethal form of brain
cancer with unclear etiology. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular
prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
infections in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 42 FFPE brain tumor samples
from GBM patients and 42 brain autopsies from subjects without neurological
disorders. The presence of EBV and HCMV DNA was determined, using PCR and
nested-PCR assays, respectively.
Results: HCMV DNA was detected in 3 out of 42 (7.1%) of GBM samples and was
absent from the control group (p = 0.07). Importantly, EBV DNA was detected in 9 
out of 42 (21.4%) brain tissue specimens of GBM subjects, but again in none of
the control group (p = 0.001).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that infection with EBV is associated with GBM.
