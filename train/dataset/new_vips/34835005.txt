Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is one of the coronaviruses causing a mild
common cold, but few studies have been made on this strain. Here, we identified
the molecular mechanisms involved in HCoV-OC43-induced apoptosis and its
implications for viral reproduction in Vero cells and MRC-5 cells. HCoV-OC43
infection induced apoptosis that was accompanied by cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP, degradation of cyclin D1, and cell cycle arrest at S and G2M phases.
Dephosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, induced by HCoV-OC43 infection, was also
associated with HCoV-OC43-mediated apoptosis. The pan-caspase inhibitor
effectively prevented HCoV-OC43-induced apoptosis and reduced viral replication, 
suggesting that apoptosis contributes to viral replication. Collectively our
results indicate that HCoV-OC43 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis to promote
viral replication in Vero cells and MRC-5 cells.
