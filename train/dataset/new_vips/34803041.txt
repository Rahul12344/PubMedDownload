Optimizing Care for People Experiencing Homelessness and Serious Mental Illness
amidst COVID-19: A Street Outreach Perspective.

Wynn Y, Stergiopoulos V.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected marginalized individuals
with multiple vulnerabilities, including those experiencing serious mental
illness and homelessness. This population is adversely affected by the pandemic
due to loss of opportunities for social connection and support, decreased
engagement with community services, and increased risk of mental and physical
health deterioration. Multidisciplinary street outreach teams have employed an
instrumental service model in the provision of community-based, comprehensive
care for individuals experiencing homelessness, often with concurrent challenges 
with mental illness and addictions. However, during this period of unprecedented 
and additional vulnerability, street outreach teams must adapt their existing
practices to meet the evolving needs of their client population. This article
aims to highlight the impact of COVID-19 on people with serious mental illness
experiencing homelessness, and then share lessons learned and recommendations for
action to optimize care and support to this vulnerable population amidst
COVID-19.
