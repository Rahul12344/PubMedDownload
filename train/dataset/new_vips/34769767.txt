AIM: This study aims to assess the influence of training on nurses' attitudes
toward end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic alarm state in Spain.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Data collection was carried out by
means of an ad hoc questionnaire using Google Forms in April and May 2020. The
score of attitudes toward end-of-life care was used, to which sociodemographic
variables and training in palliative care were added.
METHODS: Data were collected from 238 nursing professionals who had cared for
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 adult patients at the end-of-life stage in a hospital
or nursing home.
RESULTS: Results showed that 51% of the nurses in the sample had training in
palliative care. However, the percentage decreased to 38.5% among those who cared
for COVID-19 patients and to 44.5% in those who cared for non-COVID-19 patients. 
In relation to attitudes about end-of-life care, more positive attitudes and a
higher mean score were found in the trained group.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care training is a key element in end-of-life care and is
even more important in times of COVID-19.
IMPACT: Although end-of-life accompaniment has been studied, few studies have
included the influence of training on this during the pandemic. This study
identifies key elements of accompaniment and training in a comparison of COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. In relation to attitudes toward
end-of-life care, the results showed a more positive attitude and a higher mean
score in the trained group (3.43 ± 0.37 versus 3.21 ± 0.32), the difference being
statistically significant (p < 0.001).
