Human race has survived several outbreak of pandemics in the past and their
impact was long lasting. Some of the recent pandemics have been caused by a
viruses known as Coronaviruses (CoVs) which are diverse, complex, adaptable
viruses that have a significant impact on human health and animal productivity.
The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has
quickly spread throughout the world. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), have led to a global epidemic 
with high morbidity and mortality. Human pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys,
and blood vessels. The efforts to contain the virus are undergoing throughout the
world, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and
virulence. Thus, the ongoing studies to promote the understanding of HCoVs will
help to avoid or/and minimize the impact of anticipated pandemics in future.
