COVID-19 is mainly associated with respiratory distress syndrome, but a subset of
patients often present gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Imbalances of gut
microbiota have been previously linked to respiratory virus infection.
Understanding how the gut-lung axis affects the progression of COVID-19 can
provide a novel framework for therapies and management. In this study, we
examined the gut microbiota of patients with COVID-19 (n = 47) and compared it to
healthy controls (n = 19). Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have
identified four microorganisms unique in COVID-19 patients, namely Streptococcus 
thermophilus, Bacteroides oleiciplenus, Fusobacterium ulcerans, and Prevotella
bivia. The abundances of Bacteroides stercoris, B. vulgatus, B. massiliensis,
Bifidobacterium longum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lachnospiraceae bacterium
5163FAA, Prevotella bivia, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 6145, and
Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 2244A were enriched in COVID-19 patients, whereas
the abundances of Clostridium nexile, Streptococcus salivarius, Coprococcus
catus, Eubacterium hallii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Adlercreutzia
equolifaciens were decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of
butyrate-producing Roseburia inulinivorans is evidently depleted in COVID-19
patients, while the relative abundances of Paraprevotella sp. and the probiotic
Streptococcus thermophilus were increased. We further identified 30 KEGG
orthology (KO) modules overrepresented, with 7 increasing and 23 decreasing
modules. Notably, 15 optimal microbial markers were identified using the random
forest model to have strong diagnostic potential in distinguishing COVID-19.
Based on Spearman's correlation, eight species were associated with eight
clinical indices. Moreover, the increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and
decreased abundance of Firmicutes were also found across clinical types of
COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the alterations of gut microbiota in patients
with COVID-19 may influence disease severity. Our COVID-19 classifier, which was 
cross-regionally verified, provides a proof of concept that a set of microbial
species markers can distinguish the presence of COVID-19.
