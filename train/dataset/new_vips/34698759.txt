OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge and use of personal protective equipment by
nursing professionals of Primary Health Care during the Covid-19 pandemic.
METHOD: This is an exploratory study of a non-probabilistic sample developed in
Basic Health Units in the city of Picos, Piauí, Brazil. Data were collected
between June and August 2020, by phone call, following a semi-structured script, 
with responses recording and transcription. For material analysis, the software
IRaMuTeQ was used for statistical textual analyses: Descending Hierarchical
Classification, similarity analysis, and word cloud.
RESULTS: From the corpus of 6,873 words and 832 lexical units, three categories
were created: (1) motivations and barriers for use (20.9%); (2) handling of
personal protective equipment (classes 5 and 4) with 25% and 21.6%, respectively,
and (3) measures to protect users and health professionals (classes 3 and 5) with
17.6% and 14.9%.
CONCLUSION: The nursing professionals interviewed demonstrated that they did not 
have sufficient knowledge for the proper use of the equipment, which could
compromise their integrity and that of the patient as a subject who receives
unsafe care.
