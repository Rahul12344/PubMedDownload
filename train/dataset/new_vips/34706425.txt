BACKGROUND: With concern over the rise in mental health symptoms associated with 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the present study set out to address the absence of
pandemic-specific screening tools for detecting those in Chinese societies who
are at-risk for experiencing mental distress due to the pandemic; thus, its aim
was to validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19
Scale (OCS) in Chinese adults.
METHODS: With a two-stage cluster random sampling method, we surveyed 1011
Chinese community-dwelling adults (38.8% men; 41.2 years old on average with an
SD of 15.8) in June and July of 2020.
RESULTS: Our psychometric evaluation results showed that the Chinese version of
CAS and OCS retained their original one-dimensional structure and demonstrated
measurement invariance across genders. In line with validation studies of the CAS
and OCS in other languages, subsequent analyses also provided support to our
Chinese version with respect to their satisfactory internal consistency (α = .87 
and .73, respectively), and good concurrent validity (i.e., positive associations
with negative feelings, excessive time-consumption, subjective distress, and
functioning impairment).
LIMITATIONS: Due to constraints of time and cross-sectional design, we only
validated CAS and OCS among Chinese adults and did not evaluate their test-retest
reliability nor predictive validity.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the practical benefits of understanding the source of
mental symptoms during the pandemic, we recommend the use of CAS and OCS in
Chinese communities to facilitate early identification and intervention for those
who require clinical attention due to their COVID-19 related anxiety and
obsessive thoughts.
