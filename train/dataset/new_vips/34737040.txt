Recombinantly expressed VP1 of norovirus self-assembled and formed norovirus-like
particles (NoV-LPs). This native VP1 was expressed using the Bombyx mori
nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) expression system in silkworm larva. NoV-LPs were
collected from silkworm fat body lysate by density gradient centrifugation. To
improve the purity of the NoV-LP, the proteins were further purified using
immobilized metal affinity chromatography based on the surface exposed side chain
of histidine residues. The additional purification led to a highly purified
virus-like particle (VLP). The morphology and size of the purified VLPs were
examined using a transmission electron microscope, and dynamic light scattering
revealed a monodispersed spherical morphology with a diameter of 34 nm. The
purified product had a purity of >90% with a recovery yield of 48.7% (equivalent 
to 930 μg) from crude lysate, obtained from seven silkworm larvae. In addition,
the purified VLP could be recognized by antibodies against GII norovirus in
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which indicated that the
silkworm-derived VLP is biologically functional as a NoV-LP in its native state, 
is structurally correct, and exerts its biological function. Our results suggest 
that the silkworm-derived NoV-LP may be useful for subsequent applications, such 
as in a vaccine platform. Moreover, the silkworm-based expression system is known
for its robustness, facile up-scalability, and relatively low expense compared to
insect cell systems.
