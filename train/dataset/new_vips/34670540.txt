BACKGROUND: Psychological health has been one of the aspects affected by the
recent COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to evaluate the patterns of Google search for
mental distress symptoms of Italian citizens during the various phases of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We assessed Google searches for psychological-health related words. We
gathered and analyzed data on daily search queries on depression, anxiety, and
insomnia from Google Trends, in a time ranging from the Pre-COVID phase
(beginning 25th January 2020) up to the second wave phase (ending 17th October
2020). We performed three general linear models on search trends of the three
words and tested whether and to what extent official data about new cases of
COVID-19, information searching on new cases, and the government health measures 
impacted on these trends.
RESULTS: Average daily search queries were higher for anxiety, followed by
depression and insomnia. General linear models performed to assess differences in
daily search queries for anxiety, depression and insomnia were significant,
respectively [F(13, 253) = 6.80, P < .001]; [F(13, 253) = 10.25, P < .001];
[F(13, 253) = 6.61, P < .001]. Specifically, daily search queries differed among 
different phases of managing the COVID-19 outbreak: anxiety [F(5, 253) = 10.35,
P < .001, [Formula: see text] = .17]; depression [F(5, 253) = 13.59, P < .001,
[Formula: see text] = .21]; insomnia [F(5, 253) = 3.52, P = .004, [Formula: see
text] = .07].
CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributed to the investigation of online
information-seeking behaviors of Italians regarding mental health throughout the 
entire phase of the pandemic and provides insights on the possible future trends 
of mental distress during upcoming pandemic phases.
