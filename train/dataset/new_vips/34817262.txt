BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of people pursuing a surgical career in
the UK has decreased. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of
surgical placements for medical students and has affected surgical education.
This study evaluates the perceptions and impact of a 1-day virtual surgical
conference for medical students considering pursuing a surgical career.
METHODS: All delegates of the 2021 Barts and The London International Surgical
Conference were invited to participate in two online surveys pre- and
post-conference. Data were collected and analysed to evaluate delegates' reasons 
for attending the conference, and attitudes towards virtual conferences and a
surgical career before and after the conference.
RESULTS: Out of 132 participants, 106 (80.3%) completed both the pre- and
post-conference surveys. Clinical students showed a statistically significant
difference in interest in pursuing a surgical career after the conference than
before (P=0.03), unlike pre-clinical students (P=0.12). Post-conference, 43
(40.6%) preferred a virtual to a face-to-face conference, which was a slight
increase from 40 (37.7%) pre-conference, while 73 (68.9%) and 80 (75.5%)
participants favoured virtual talks and presentations respectively. In contrast, 
only 12 (11.3%) and 21 (19.8%) students preferred workshops and networking
virtually. Furthermore, delegates liked the global accessibility and
environmentally-friendly nature of virtual conferences but found they can be less
engaging and be disrupted by a poor internet connection.
CONCLUSIONS: Virtual surgical conferences have many benefits and can help
encourage medical students towards a surgical career. They could help bridge the 
surgical educational gap in medical school during these unprecedented times.
Virtual conferences, which have a broader and more inclusive reach, could be an
important complement to conventional conferences after the pandemic.
