Interferon lambdas (IFNλ) (also known as type III IFNs) are critical cytokines
that combat infection predominantly at barrier tissues, such as the lung, liver, 
and gastrointestinal tract. Humans have four IFNλs (1-4), where IFNλ1-3 show
~80%-95% homology, and IFNλ4 is the most divergent displaying only ~30% sequence 
identity. Variants in IFNλ4 in humans are associated with the outcome of
infection, such as with hepatitis C virus. However, how IFNλ4 variants impact
cytokine signalling in other tissues and how well this is conserved is largely
unknown. In this study, we address whether differences in antiviral signalling
exist between IFNλ4 variants in human hepatocyte and intestinal cells, comparing 
them to IFNλ3. We demonstrate that compared to IFNλ3, wild-type human IFNλ4
induces a signalling response with distinct magnitudes and kinetics, which is
modified by naturally occurring variants P70S and K154E in both cell types.
IFNλ4's distinct antiviral response was more rapid yet transient compared to
IFNλ1 and 3. Additionally, divergent antiviral kinetics were also observed using 
non-human primate IFNλs and cell lines. Furthermore, an IFNλ4-like
receptor-interacting interface failed to alter IFNλ1's kinetics. Together, our
data provide further evidence that major functional differences exist within the 
IFNλ gene family. These results highlight the possible tissue specialisation of
IFNλs and encourage further investigation of the divergent, non-redundant
activities of IFNλ4 and other IFNλs.
