COVID-19 has, and continues to, wreak havoc worldwide, and the healthcare system 
has been particularly challenged with personnel shortages, resource insecurity,
mixed messages, and fear to name a few. At the outset, it was thought the
pandemic would be short-lived, resulting in the enactment of disaster plans in
hospitals. Such autocratic approaches are not always effective in the long-term; 
a servant leadership approach is more conducive to engaging teams, and this dyad 
structure supports effective leadership during challenging times. While there is 
not one right approach to leading through a pandemic, lessons learned from this
pandemic are applicable when, not if, the next pandemic occurs.
