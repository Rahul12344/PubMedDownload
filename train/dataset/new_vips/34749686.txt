BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the financial insecurity of
women and their families globally. Some studies have explored the impact of
financial strain among pregnant women, in particular, during the pandemic.
However, less is known about the factors associated with pregnant women's
experiences of material hardship.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a non-probability sample to examine the 
factors associated with pregnant women's experiences of material hardship during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, 183 pregnant women living in the United
States participated in an online Qualtrics panel survey. In addition to
socio-demographic characteristics, individuals were asked about their finances
and predictors of financial well-being, mental health symptoms, and intimate
partner violence (IPV) experiences. Chi-square analysis and one-way ANOVA were
used to examine whether women's experiences with material hardship and associated
factors differed by income level (i.e., less than $20,000; $20,000 to $60,000;
more than $60,000). Ordinary least squares regression was used to calculate
unadjusted and adjusted estimates.
RESULTS: Study findings showed that the majority of women in the sample
experienced at least one form of material hardship in the past year. Individuals 
with an annual household income less than $20,000 reported the highest average
number of material hardships experienced (M = 3.7, SD = 2.8). Compared to women
with household incomes less than $20,000, women with incomes of more than $60,000
reported significantly fewer material hardships, less financial strain, and
higher levels of financial support, economic self-efficacy, and
economic-self-sufficiency. Women with incomes of $60,000 or more also reported
significantly lower levels of psychological abuse, and a smaller percentage met
the cut-off for anxiety. Economic self-sufficiency, financial strain,
posttraumatic stress disorder, and economic abuse were all significantly
associated with material hardship.
CONCLUSIONS: A contribution of this study is that it highlights the significant, 
positive association between economic abuse, a unique form of IPV, and material
hardship among pregnant women during the pandemic. These findings suggest the
need for policy and practice interventions that help to ameliorate the financial 
insecurity experienced by some pregnant women, as well as respond to associated
bidirectional vulnerabilities (e.g., mental health symptoms, experiences of IPV).
