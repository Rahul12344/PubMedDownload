BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive drugs have important role in transplant of solid
grafts, it aim avoid episodes of acute and chronic rejection and improving graft 
survival and patient survival. In Brazil, in 2016, liver transplantation was the 
third most frequent, with 1,880 transplants performed, of which 150 in Rio Grande
do Sul. Several studies evaluated the association between variability in blood
levels of immunosuppressive tacrolimus and late acute cellular graft rejection.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of tacrolimus blood levels with
clinical outcomes late acute cellular rejection, death, patient survival and
graft survival in patients undergoing liver transplantation.
METHODS: This is a retrospective longitudinal study including patients submitted 
to adult liver transplantation by the Liver Transplantation Group in the Santa
Casa de Misericórdia Hospital of Porto Alegre, from January 2006 to January 2013,
and who used tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy.
RESULTS: Of the 127 patients included in the study, the majority were male
(70.1%), 52-60 years old (33.9%) at the transplant. The most frequent causes of
liver transplantation in this series were hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular
carcinoma (24.4%) and alcohol (15.7%). Thirteen patients had late acute cellular 
rejection (10.2%); of these, three had two episodes. Regarding severity
classification, seven patients had mild late acute cellular rejection. The mean
time of rejection after liver transplantation was 14 months (ranging from 8 to 33
months). Overall survival was 8.98 years. Regarding tacrolimus blood levels, 52
patients with a variation ≥2 standard deviations were identified. Of these
patients, eight had rejection; however, the association was not significant
(P=0.146). A significant association was found between variation ≥2 standard
deviations in tacrolimus blood levels and death (P=0.023) and survival (P=0.019).
Regarding 5-year follow-up of graft survival, being two standard deviations above
increases by 2.26 times the risk of transplanted graft loss, and for each unit of
increase of standard deviation of tacrolimus blood levels there is a two-fold
increase in the risk of graft loss in 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Increased risk of graft loss associated with increased standard
deviations of tacrolimus blood levels may indicate the need for more rigorous and
prospective monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels.
