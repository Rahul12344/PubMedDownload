BACKGROUND: The impact of biometric covariates on risk for adverse outcomes of
COVID-19 disease was assessed by numerous observational studies on unstratified
cohorts, which show great heterogeneity. However, multilevel evaluations to find 
possible complex, e.g. non-monotonic multi-variate patterns reflecting mutual
interference of parameters are missing. We used a more detailed, computational
analysis to investigate the influence of biometric differences on mortality and
disease evolution among severely ill COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: We analyzed a group of COVID-19 patients requiring Intensive care unit
(ICU) treatment. For further analysis, the study group was segmented into six
subgroups according to Body mass index (BMI) and age. To link the BMI/age derived
subgroups with risk factors, we performed an enrichment analysis of diagnostic
parameters and comorbidities. To suppress spurious patterns, multiple
segmentations were analyzed and integrated into a consensus score for each
analysis step.
RESULTS: We analyzed 81 COVID-19 patients, of whom 67 required mechanical
ventilation (MV). Mean mortality was 35.8%. We found a complex, non-monotonic
interaction between age, BMI and mortality. A subcohort of patients with younger 
age and intermediate BMI exhibited a strongly reduced mortality risk (p < 0.001),
while differences in all other groups were not significant. Univariate impacts of
BMI or age on mortality were missing. Comparing MV with non-MV patients, we found
an enrichment of baseline CRP, PCT and D-Dimers within the MV group, but not when
comparing survivors vs. non-survivors within the MV patient group.
CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this study was to get a more detailed insight into the
influence of biometric covariates on the outcome of COVID-19 patients with high
degree of severity. We found that survival in MV is affected by complex
interactions of covariates differing to the reported covariates, which are hidden
in generic, non-stratified studies on risk factors. Hence, our study suggests
that a detailed, multivariate pattern analysis on larger patient cohorts
reflecting the specific disease stages might reveal more specific patterns of
risk factors supporting individually adapted treatment strategies.
