Integrations from non-retroviral RNA viruses (nrEVEs) have been identified across
several taxa, including mosquitoes. Amongst all Culicinae species, the viral
vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus stand out for their high number of
nrEVEs. In addition, Aedes nrEVEs are enriched in piRNA clusters and generate
piRNAs that can silence incoming viral genomes. As such, nrEVEs represent a new
form of inherited antiviral immunity. To propel this discovery into novel
transmission-blocking vector control strategies, a deeper understanding of nrEVE 
biology and evolution is essential because differences in the landscape of nrEVEs
have been identified in wild-caught mosquitoes, the piRNA profile of nrEVEs is
not homogeneous and nrEVEs outside piRNA clusters exist and are expressed at the 
mRNA level. Here we summarise current knowledge on nrEVEs in mosquitoes and we
point out the many unanswered questions and potentials of these genomic elements.
