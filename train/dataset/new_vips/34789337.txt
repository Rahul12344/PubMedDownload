OBJECTIVE: To adapt 'fishplots' to describe real-time evolution of SARS-CoV-2
genomic clusters.
RESULTS: This novel analysis adapted the fishplot to depict the size and duration
of circulating genomic clusters over time in New South Wales, Australia. It
illuminated the effectiveness of interventions on the emergence, spread and
eventual elimination of clusters and distilled genomic data into clear
information to inform public health action.
