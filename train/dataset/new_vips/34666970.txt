This review of the government's policy during the pandemic flags a number of
ethical concerns. The private healthcare sector's treatment of Covid-19 patients 
has generated mistrust and anger. However, the government has not held it
accountable and instead commercialisation has subverted the pandemic needs.
Government hospitals weakened by decades of cuts are exposed to internal
reorganisation of services through the public-private partnership mechanism, a
neoliberal policy that has persisted through the pandemic. There is a need to
re-examine the government's policy reliance on scaling-up coverage through the
private sector in the pandemic and after.
