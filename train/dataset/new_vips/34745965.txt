Autophagy is a self-degradative process important for balancing cellular
homeostasis at critical times in development and/or in response to nutrient
stress. This is particularly relevant in tumor model in which autophagy has been 
demonstrated to have an important impact on tumor behavior. In one hand,
autophagy limits tumor transformation of precancerous cells in early stage, and
in the other hand, it favors the survival, proliferation, metastasis, and
resistance to antitumor therapies in more advanced tumors. This catabolic
machinery can be induced by an important variety of extra- and intracellular
stimuli. For instance, viral infection has often been associated to autophagic
modulation, and the role of autophagy in virus replication differs according to
the virus studied. In the context of tumor development, virus-modulated autophagy
can have an important impact on tumor cells' fate. Extensive analyses have shed
light on the molecular and/or functional complex mechanisms by which
virus-modulated autophagy influences precancerous or tumor cell development. This
review includes an overview of discoveries describing the repercussions of an
autophagy perturbation during viral infections on tumor behavior.
