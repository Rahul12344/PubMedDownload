Recognition of climate-sensitive infectious diseases is crucial for mitigating
health threats from climate change. Recent studies have reasoned about potential 
climate sensitivity of diseases in the Northern/Arctic Region, where climate
change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease and climate data for this
region, we here comprehensively quantify empirical climate-disease relationships.
Results show significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis, tick-borne 
encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection, cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with 
climate variables related to temperature and freshwater conditions. These
data-driven results are consistent with previous reasoning-based propositions of 
climate-sensitive infections as increasing threats for humans, with notable
exceptions for TBE and leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease
with increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and projected for, 
the Northern/Arctic Region. This study provides significant data-based
underpinning for simplified empirical assessments of the risks of several
infectious diseases under future climate change.
