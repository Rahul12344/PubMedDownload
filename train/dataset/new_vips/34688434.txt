Many nations are pursuing the rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as an exit strategy 
from unprecedented COVID-19-related restrictions. However, the success of this
strategy relies critically on the duration of protective immunity resulting from 
both natural infection and vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits an adaptive 
immune response against a large breadth of viral epitopes, although the duration 
of the response varies with age and disease severity. Current evidence from case 
studies and large observational studies suggests that, consistent with research
on other common respiratory viruses, a protective immunological response lasts
for approximately 5-12 months from primary infection, with reinfection being more
likely given an insufficiently robust primary humoral response. Markers of
humoral and cell-mediated immune memory can persist over many months, and might
help to mitigate against severe disease upon reinfection. Emerging data,
including evidence of breakthrough infections, suggest that vaccine effectiveness
might be reduced significantly against emerging variants of concern, and hence
secondary vaccines will need to be developed to maintain population-level
protective immunity. Nonetheless, other interventions will also be required, with
further outbreaks likely to occur due to antigenic drift, selective pressures for
novel variants, and global population mobility.
