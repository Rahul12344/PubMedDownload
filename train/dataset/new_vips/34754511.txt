Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes disease in domestic and wild
ungulates, is the target of a Global Eradication Programme, and threatens
biodiversity. Understanding the epidemiology and evolution of PPRV in wildlife is
important but hampered by the paucity of wildlife-origin PPRV genomes. In this
study, full PPRV genomes were generated from three Mongolian saiga antelope, one 
Siberian ibex, and one goitered gazelle from the 2016-2017 PPRV outbreak.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that for Mongolian and Chinese PPRV since 2013, the 
wildlife and livestock-origin genomes were closely related and interspersed.
There was strong phylogenetic support for a monophyletic group of PPRV from
Mongolian wildlife and livestock, belonging to a clade of lineage IV PPRV from
livestock and wildlife from China since 2013. Discrete diffusion analysis found
strong support for PPRV spread into Mongolia from China, and phylogeographic
analysis indicated Xinjiang Province as the most likely origin, although genomic 
surveillance for PPRV is poor and lack of sampling from other regions could bias 
this result. Times of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) were June 2015 (95 per 
cent highest posterior density (HPD): August 2014 to March 2016) for all
Mongolian PPRV genomes and May 2016 (95 per cent HPD: October 2015 to October
2016) for Mongolian wildlife-origin PPRV. This suggests that PPRV was circulating
undetected in Mongolia for at least 6 months before the first reported outbreak
in August 2016 and that wildlife were likely infected before livestock
vaccination began in October 2016. Finally, genetic variation and positively
selected sites were identified that might be related to PPRV emergence in
Mongolian wildlife. This study is the first to sequence multiple PPRV genomes
from a wildlife outbreak, across several host species. Additional full PPRV
genomes and associated metadata from the livestock-wildlife interface are needed 
to enhance the power of molecular epidemiology, support PPRV eradication, and
safeguard the health of the whole ungulate community.
