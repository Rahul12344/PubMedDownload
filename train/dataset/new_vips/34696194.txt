First detected in Wuhan, China, a highly contagious coronavirus, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, spread
globally in December of 2019. As of 19 September 2021, approximately 4.5 million 
people have died globally, and 215 million active cases have been reported. To
date, six vaccines have been developed and approved for human use. However,
current production and supply capabilities are unable to meet global demands to
immunize the entire world population. Only a few countries have been able to
successfully vaccinate many of their residents. Therefore, an alternative vaccine
that can be prepared in an easy and cost-effective manner is urgently needed. A
vaccine that could be prepared in this manner, as well as can be preserved and
transported at room temperature, would be of great benefit to public health. It
is possible to develop such an alternative vaccine by using nano- or
microparticle platforms. These platforms address most of the existing vaccine
limitations as they are stable at room temperature, are inexpensive to produce
and distribute, can be administered orally, and do not require cold chain storage
for transportation or preservation. Particulate vaccines can be administered as
either oral solutions or in sublingual or buccal film dosage forms. Besides
improved patient compliance, the major advantage of oral, sublingual, and buccal 
routes of administration is that they can elicit mucosal immunity. Mucosal
immunity, along with systemic immunity, can be a strong defense against
SARS-CoV-2 as the virus enters the system through inhalation or saliva. This
review discusses the possibility to produce a particulate COVID vaccine by using 
nano- or microparticles as platforms for oral administration or in sublingual or 
buccal film dosage forms in order to accelerate global vaccination.
