BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
developed variants escaping neutralization antibody immunity established against 
the original virus. An understanding of broad-spectrum adaptive immunity,
including CD8+ T cell immunity to wide range of epitopes, could help
translational efforts to improve coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention
and therapy. However, there have been few direct studies in which such immunity
exists in a population.
METHODS: We selected SARS-CoV-2-conserved structural peptides that are not prone 
to mutation as antigens for broad-spectrum CD8+ T cell immunity. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from unexposed healthy donors were stimulated with
these peptides in vitro and CD8+ T cell-specific response was monitored. The
conserved peptide-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted for T cell receptor (TCR)
repertoire sequencing. The presence of specific complementary determining region 
3 (CDR3) clones was analyzed in a healthy cohort.
RESULTS: For each structural protein, including S, E, M, N, the conserved
peptides could potentially provide the largest number of major histocompatibility
complex-I (MHC-I) epitopes in the Oriental and Caucasian populations. For
conserved peptides from spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)
proteins, we found that there were no cross-reactive memory T cells in the
unexposed individuals. Instead, their T cells contain na√Øve TCR repertoire
recognizing these conserved peptides. Using TCR sequencing and CDR3 clustering
for the conserved peptides specific T cells, we found that the recovered patients
had a higher proportion of TCR repertoire similar with that of specific CD8+ T
cells in unexposed individuals. Meanwhile, CDR3 clones of the above T cells were 
widely present in the healthy population.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 specific
CD8+ TCR repertoire in unexposed healthy population, which is implicated in the
development and implementation of broad-spectrum vaccines against COVID-19.
