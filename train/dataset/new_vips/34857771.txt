The influenza vaccine field has been constantly evolving to improve the speed,
scalability, and flexibility of manufacturing, and to improve the breadth and
longevity of the protective immune response across age groups, giving rise to an 
array of next generation vaccines in development. Among these, the recombinant
influenza vaccine tetravalent (RIV4), using a baculovirus expression vector
system to express recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) in insect cells, is the only
one to have reached the market and has been studied extensively. We describe how 
the unique structural features of rHA in RIV4 improve protective immune responses
compared to conventional influenza vaccines made from propagated influenza virus.
In addition to the sequence integrity, characteristic of recombinant proteins,
unique post-translational processing of the rHA in insect cells instills
favourable tertiary and quaternary structural features. The absence of
protease-driven cleavage and addition of simple N-linked glycans help to preserve
and expose certain conserved epitopes on HA molecules, which are likely
responsible for the high levels of broadly cross-reactive and protective
antibodies with rare specificities observed with RIV4. Furthermore, the presence 
of uniform compact HA oligomers and absence of egg proteins, viral RNA or process
impurities, typically found in conventional vaccines, are expected to eliminate
potential adverse reactions to these components in susceptible individuals with
the use of RIV4. These distinct structural features and purity of the recombinant
HA vaccine thus provide a number of benefits in vaccine performance which can be 
extended to other viral targets, such as for COVID-19.
