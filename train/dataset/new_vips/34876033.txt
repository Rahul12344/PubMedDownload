BACKGROUND: To manage severe or potentially severe cases of CoronaVirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19), therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting Spike protein of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been designed. 
It has been noted in vitro that upon exposure to these treatments, mutations
could be selected.
CASE PRESENTATION: We here report the case of an immunosuppressed patient
infected with a B.1.1.7 variant, who received a combination of monoclonal
antibodies, and subsequently selected mutations K417N, E484K and Q493R on Spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case raises the importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 mutations in
patients receiving monoclonal antibodies and having persistent excretion of the
virus, in order to offer optimal management of their infection, and strengthen
prevention measures to avoid subsequent transmission of these selected variants.
