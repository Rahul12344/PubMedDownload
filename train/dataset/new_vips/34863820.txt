TRIM5γ, together with TRIM31, has been shown to promote HBx ubiquitination and
degradation. This study aimed to explore whether a patient with HCC (hepatic cell
carcinoma) having a small nucleotide inserted into the TRIM31 gene, which made a 
shorter transcript stop at 758 bp, would result in blocking the activity of
TRIM31 in promoting HBx degradation. Besides, this study aimed to determine the
binding region of the TRIM31-TRIM5γ-HBx complex. HBV (Hepatitis B virus)
infection was reported to induce type-III IFN but not type-I or type-II IFNs,
here TRIM31 was found to be a type III rather than a type I stimulated gene,
which was indispensable in inhibiting the hepatitis B virus replication by the
interferon families. Thus, this study further identified the critical role of
TRIM31 in the host-hepatitis B virus interaction.
