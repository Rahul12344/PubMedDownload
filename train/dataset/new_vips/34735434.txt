The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
resulted in a pandemic causing significant damage to public health and the
economy. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) have been hampered by the lack of robust mouse models. To overcome
this barrier, we used a reverse genetic system to generate a mouse-adapted strain
of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating key mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 variants, this
model recapitulates critical elements of human infection including viral
replication in the lung, immune cell infiltration, and significant in vivo
disease. Importantly, mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 does not impair replication 
in human airway cells and maintains antigenicity similar to human SARS-CoV-2
strains. Coupled with the incorporation of mutations found in variants of
concern, CMA3p20 offers several advantages over other mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2
strains. Using this model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are
protected from lethal challenge with the original Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting immunity from heterologous
Coronavirus (CoV) strains. Together, the results highlight the use of this mouse 
model for further study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.
