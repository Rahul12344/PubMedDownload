On Jan. 21, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the
first case of novel coronavirus, later named "severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2), in the U.S. At the Department of State Health
Services (DSHS) we realized it was only a matter of time before the virus arrived
in Texas. By Jan. 31, we activated the DSHS State Medical Operations Center to
prepare for the coming crisis.
