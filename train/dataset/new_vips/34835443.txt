Zoonotic viruses threaten the lives of millions of people annually, exacerbated
by climate change, human encroachment into wildlife habitats, and habitat
destruction. The Powassan virus (POWV) is a rare tick-borne virus that can cause 
severe neurological damage and death, and the incidence of the associated disease
(Powassan virus disease) is increasing in the eastern United States. The
mechanisms by which POWV is maintained in nature and transmitted to humans are
complex and only partly understood. This review provides an overview of what is
known about the vector species, vector-host transmission dynamics, and
environmental and human-driven factors that may be aiding the spread of both the 
vector and virus.
