COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an occupational health risk,
especially for healthcare employees due to their higher exposure and consequently
higher risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. This study was designed
to determine the longitudinal seroprevalence of specific immunoglobulin-G (IgG)
antibodies in employees in a hospital setting. All employees in a secondary care 
hospital, including healthcare and non-healthcare workers, were invited to
participate in this single-center study. After an initial screening, a 6-month
follow-up was carried out, which included serological examination for SARS-CoV-2 
IgG antibodies and a questionnaire for self-reported symptoms, self-perception,
and thoughts about local and national hygiene and pandemic plans. The
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 0.74% among 406 hospital
employees (0.75% in healthcare workers, 0.72% in non-healthcare workers),
initially recruited in April 2020, in their follow-up blood specimens in October 
2020. In this study, 30.54% of the participants reported using the official
German coronavirus mobile application and the majority were content with the
local and national rules in relation to coronavirus-related restrictions. At the 
6-month follow-up, the 0.74% seroprevalence was below the reported seroprevalence
of 1.35% in the general German population. The prevalence in healthcare workers
in direct patient care compared with that in workers without direct patient
contact did not differ significantly. Further follow-up to monitor the
seroprevalence in the high-risk healthcare sector during the ongoing global
pandemic is essential.
