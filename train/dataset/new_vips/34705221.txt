As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens human health globally,
infectious disorders have become one of the most challenging problem for the
medical community. Natural products (NP) have been a prolific source of
antimicrobial agents with widely divergent structures and a range vast biological
activities. A dataset comprising 618 articles, including 646 NP-based compounds
from 672 species of natural sources with biological activities against 21
infectious pathogens from five categories, was assembled through manual selection
of published articles. These data were used to identify 268 NP-based compounds
classified into ten groups, which were used for network pharmacology analysis to 
capture the most promising lead-compounds such as agelasine D, dicumarol,
dihydroartemisinin and pyridomycin. The distribution of maximum Tanimoto scores
indicated that compounds which inhibited parasites exhibited low diversity,
whereas the chemistries inhibiting bacteria, fungi, and viruses showed more
structural diversity. A total of 331 species of medicinal plants with compounds
exhibiting antimicrobial activities were selected to classify the family sources.
The family Asteraceae possesses various compounds against C. neoformans, the
family Anacardiaceae has compounds against Salmonella typhi, the family
Cucurbitacea against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the family
Ancistrocladaceae against Plasmodium. This review summarizes currently available 
data on NP-based antimicrobials against refractory infections to provide
information for further discovery of drugs and synthetic strategies for
anti-infectious agents.
