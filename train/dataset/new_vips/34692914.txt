Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vectors of many medically relevant
arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, including Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), and yellow 
fever (YFV). Vector competence studies with Ae. aegypti often involve challenging
mosquitoes with an artificial bloodmeal containing virus and later quantifying
viral titer or infectious plaque-forming units (PFU) in various mosquito tissues 
at relevant time points post-infection. However, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are known
to exhibit midgut infection and escape barriers (MIB and MEB, respectively),
which influence the prevalence and titer of a disseminated infection and can
introduce unwanted variability into studies analyzing tissues such as the
salivary glands. To surmount this challenge, we describe herein a protocol for
the intrathoracic inoculation of ZIKV in Ae. aegypti. This method bypasses the
midgut, which leads to a more rapid and higher proportion of disseminated
infections in comparison to oral challenge, and mosquitoes become infected with a
consistent dose of virus. Our protocol is advantageous for studies that need a
large sample size of infected mosquitoes, need to bypass the midgut, or are
analyzing salivary gland infection or escape barriers. Graphic abstract: Cartoon
