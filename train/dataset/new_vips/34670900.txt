Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients <30 years old is extremely
rare. In younger patients, HCC develops against a background of persistent
hepatitis B virus infection. We herein report a 23-year-old woman with HCC with
all-negative hepatitis virus markers developing in an apparently healthy liver.
Imaging studies showed a 50-mm hypervascular mass in segment 4 of the left liver 
lobe, compatible with HCC. The patient underwent surgical resection. A
histological examination showed the presence of poorly differentiated HCC. The
patient was diagnosed with HCC developing in a healthy liver. This is an
extremely rare case of non-B non-C HCC.
