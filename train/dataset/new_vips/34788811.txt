BACKGROUND: To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical interventions
(NPI) were implemented worldwide, which impacted a broad spectrum of acute
respiratory infections (ARI).
METHODS: Etiologically diagnostic data from 142 559 cases with ARIs, who were
tested for eight viral pathogens (influenza virus, IFV; respiratory syncytial
virus, RSV; human parainfluenza virus, HPIV; human adenovirus; human
metapneumovirus; human coronavirus, HCoV; human bocavirus, HBoV, and human
rhinovirus, HRV) between 2012 and 2021, were analyzed to assess the changes of
respiratory infections in China during the first COVID-19 pandemic year compared 
to pre-pandemic years.
RESULTS: Test positive rates of all respiratory viruses decreased during 2020,
compared to the average levels during 2012-2019, with changes ranging from -17·2%
for RSV to -87·6% for IFV. Sharp decreases mostly occurred between February and
August when massive NPIs remained active, although HRV rebounded to the
historical level during the summer. While IFV and HMPV were consistently
suppressed year round, RSV, HPIV, HCoV, HRV HBov resurged and went beyond
historical levels during September, 2020-January, 2021, after NPIs were largely
relaxed and schools reopened. Resurgence was more prominent among children
younger than 18 years and in Northern China. These observations remain valid
after accounting for seasonality and long-term trend of each virus.
CONCLUSIONS: Activities of respiratory viral infections were reduced
substantially in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, and massive NPIs were
likely the main driver. Lifting of NPIs can lead to resurgence of viral
infections, particularly in children.
