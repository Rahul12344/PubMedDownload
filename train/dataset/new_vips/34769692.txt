BACKGROUND: Restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a
significant decrease in physical activity, an increase in sedentary behavior, and
thus also such things as screen time or a change in health behavior patterns. The
survey aimed to compare levels of physical activity, screen time, hours spent
sitting and sleeping time among Polish children aged 3-5 years of age before and 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We identified 3000 respondents under five years of age, at Polish
kindergartens. The questionnaire consists of 62 questions according to the
recommendations of health behavior in school-aged children. The questionnaire was
completed by the parents of these children.
RESULTS: Only 30.77% of children complied with WHO criteria before the pandemic. 
During the pandemic, the percentage of children meeting the recommendations for
physical activity decreased even more. Children spent much more time in a sitting
position before the restrictions. The children slept as recommended 10-13 h a
day, and the pandemic caused an increase in sleep duration of 10-18%. Most
children had a limited time allowed for the use of electronic devices already
before the pandemic, but during the pandemic the results negatively decreased by 
71.54%.
CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate decreased physical activity and
increased screen time. It is also crucial to develop recommendations for
prevention management strategies of sedentary lifestyles in the youngest group.
