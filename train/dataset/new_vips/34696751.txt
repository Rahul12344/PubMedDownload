OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine the prevalence and sociodemographic
correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the general population
of the multi-ethnic nation of Singapore as part of the Knowledge, Practice and
Attitudes towards Diabetes study, a cross-sectional and population-based survey. 
It also examined the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behaviour,
and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHODS: Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed via the Global
Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), while physical and mental HRQoL was
assessed via the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2). Survey weights were employed
to account for complex survey design. Multivariable logistic regression models
were utilized to examine sociodemographic correlates of physical activity
(insufficient vs. sufficient physical activity) and sedentary behaviour
(< 7 h/day vs ≥7 h/day). Descriptive statistics were calculated to examine the
percentage of time spent in different domains of physical activity. Multivariable
linear regressions were conducted to examine the association between physical
activity and sedentary behaviour with physical and mental HRQoL.
RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred sixty seven participants recruited from
February 2019 to March 2020 (prior to COVID-19 lockdown and related restrictions 
in Singapore) were included in the analyses. 83.3% of respondents had sufficient 
physical activity. Age (65 years and above) and income (SGD 2000 to 3999) were
associated with a higher likelihood of insufficient physical activity. In
contrast, those of Malay ethnicity and having one chronic physical condition were
associated with a lower likelihood of insufficient physical activity. 47.7%
reported that they had sedentary behaviour of ≥7 h/day. Older age and a primary
school education were related to a lower likelihood of sedentary behaviour, while
being single, having higher income, obesity, and multimorbidity were associated
with higher sedentary behaviour. Insufficient physical activity was significantly
associated with lower physical HRQoL but was not significantly associated with
mental HRQoL. Sedentary behaviour was not significantly associated with mental or
physical HRQoL.
CONCLUSION: About 17% of the population did not meet the minimum requirements for
physical activity, while around half of the population spent a considerable time 
being sedentary. As insufficient physical activity was associated with poorer
physical HRQoL, policymakers should promote moderate physical activity and
encouraging the breaking up of prolonged sedentary periods within the middle- and
high-income groups, especially at the workplace. Increased leisure-time exercise 
should be encouraged for those in the lower- income group.
