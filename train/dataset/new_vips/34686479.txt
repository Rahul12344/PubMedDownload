OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between COVID-19 full vaccination
(two completed doses) and possible arthritis flare.
METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were identified from
population-based electronic medical records with vaccination linkage and
categorised into BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine), CoronaVac (inactive virus vaccine) and 
non-vaccinated groups. The risk of possible arthritis flare after vaccination was
compared using a propensity-weighted cohort study design. We defined possible
arthritis flare as hospitalisation and outpatient consultation related to RA or
reactive arthritis, based on diagnosis records during the episode. Weekly
prescriptions of rheumatic drugs since the launch of COVID-19 vaccination
programme were compared to complement the findings from a diagnosis-based
analysis.
RESULTS: Among 5493 patients with RA (BNT162b2: 653; CoronaVac: 671;
non-vaccinated: 4169), propensity-scored weighted Poisson regression showed no
significant association between arthritis flare and COVID-19 vaccination
((BNT162b2: adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.86, 95% Confidence Interval 0.73 to
1.01); CoronaVac: 0.87 (0.74 to 1.02)). The distribution of weekly rheumatic drug
prescriptions showed no significant differences among the three groups since the 
launch of the mass vaccination programme (all p values >0.1 from Kruskal-Wallis
test).
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not support that full vaccination of mRNA or
inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines is associated with possible arthritis flare.
