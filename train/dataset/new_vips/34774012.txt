BACKGROUND: Strategies to control coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) have often 
been based on preliminary and limited data and have tended to be slow to evolve
as new evidence emerges. Yet knowledge about COVID-19 has grown exponentially,
and the expanding rollout of vaccines presents further opportunity to reassess
the response to the pandemic more broadly.
MAIN TEXT: We review the latest evidence concerning 10 key COVID-19 policy and
strategic areas, specifically addressing: 1) the expansion of equitable vaccine
distribution, 2) the need to ease restrictions as hospitalization and mortality
rates eventually fall, 3) the advantages of emphasizing educational and harm
reduction approaches over coercive and punitive measures, 4) the need to
encourage outdoor activities, 5) the imperative to reopen schools, 6) the
far-reaching and long-term economic and psychosocial consequences of sustained
lockdowns, 7) the excessive focus on surface disinfection and other ineffective
measures, 8) the importance of reassessing testing policies and practices, 9) the
need for increasing access to outpatient therapies and prophylactics, and 10) the
necessity to better prepare for future pandemics.
CONCLUSIONS: While remarkably effective vaccines have engendered great hope, some
widely held assumptions underlying current policy approaches call for an
evidence-based reassessment. COVID-19 will require ongoing mitigation for the
foreseeable future as it transforms from a pandemic into an endemic infection,
but maintaining a constant state of emergency is not viable. A more realistic
public health approach is to adjust current mitigation goals to be more
data-driven and to minimize unintended harms associated with unfocused or
ineffective control efforts. Based on the latest evidence, we therefore present
recommendations for refining 10 key policy areas, and for applying lessons
learned from COVID-19 to prevent and prepare for future pandemics.
