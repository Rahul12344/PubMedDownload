Several viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases have been associated with
cognitive function and neuropsychiatric outcomes in humans, including human
T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). In this study, we sought to further
generalize previously reported associations of cognitive function and depression 
with HTLV-1 seropositivity and serointensity using a community-based sample of
adults aged approximately 40 to 70 years (mean = 55.3 years) from the United
Kingdom. In this sample, the results of adjusted linear regression models showed 
no associations of HTLV-1 seropositivity or serointensity with reasoning,
pairs-matching, or reaction-time cognitive tasks or with depression. In addition,
neither age, sex, educational attainment, nor income moderated associations of
HTLV-1 seropositivity or serointensity with cognitive function or depression. In 
this middle-aged to older middle-aged adult community sample, HTLV-1
seropositivity and serointensity do not appear to be associated with reasoning,
pairs-matching, and reaction-time tasks or with depression.
