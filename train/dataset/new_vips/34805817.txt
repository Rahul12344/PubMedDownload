Background & Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prediction models can inform
clinical decisions about HCC screening provided their predictions are robust. We 
conducted an external validation of 6 HCC prediction models for UK patients with 
cirrhosis and a HCV virological cure.
Methods: Patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV were identified from the Scotland 
HCV clinical database (N = 2,139) and the STratified medicine to Optimise
Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (STOP-HCV) study (N = 606). We calculated patient 
values for 4 competing non-genetic HCC prediction models, plus 2 genetic models
(for the STOP-HCV cohort only). Follow-up began at the date of sustained
virological response (SVR) achievement. HCC diagnoses were identified through
linkage to nation-wide cancer, hospitalisation, and mortality registries. We
compared discrimination and calibration measures between prediction models.
Results: Mean follow-up was 3.4-3.9 years, with 118 (Scotland) and 40 (STOP-HCV) 
incident HCCs observed. The age-male sex-ALBI-platelet count score (aMAP) model
showed the best discrimination; for example, the Concordance index (C-index) in
the Scottish cohort was 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.81). However, for all models,
discrimination varied by cohort (being better for the Scottish cohort) and by age
(being better for younger patients). In addition, genetic models performed better
in patients with HCV genotype 3. The observed 3-year HCC risk was 3.3% (95% CI
2.6-4.2) and 5.1% (3.5-7.0%) in the Scottish and STOP-HCV cohorts, respectively. 
These were most closely matched by aMAP, in which the mean predicted 3-year risk 
was 3.6% and 5.0% in the Scottish and STOP-HCV cohorts, respectively.
Conclusions: aMAP was the best-performing model in terms of both discrimination
and calibration and, therefore, should be used as a benchmark for rival models to
surpass. This study underlines the opportunity for 'real-world' risk
stratification in patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV. However, auxiliary
research is needed to help translate an HCC risk prediction into an HCC-screening
decision.
Lay summary: Patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV are at high risk of developing
liver cancer, although the risk varies substantially from one patient to the
next. Risk calculator tools can alert clinicians to patients at high risk and
thereby influence decision-making. In this study, we tested the performance of 6 
risk calculators in more than 2,500 patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV. We
show that some risk calculators are considerably better than others. Overall, we 
found that the 'aMAP' calculator worked the best, but more work is needed to
convert predictions into clinical decisions.
