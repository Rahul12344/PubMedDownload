Purpose: This study aimed to develop a radiomics score (Rad-score) extracted from
liver and spleen CT images in cirrhotic patients to predict the probability of
esophageal variceal rebleeding. Methods: In total, 173 cirrhotic patients were
enrolled in this retrospective study. A total of 2,264 radiomics features of the 
liver and spleen were extracted from CT images. Least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to select features and
generate the Rad-score. Then, the Rad-score was evaluated by the concordance
index (C-index), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the risk stratification ability of the
Rad-score. Results: Rad-scoreLiver, Rad-scoreSpleen, and Rad-scoreLiver-Spleen
were independent risk factors for EV rebleeding. The Rad-scoreLiver-Spleen, which
consisted of ten features, showed good discriminative performance, with C-indexes
of 0.853 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.776-0.904] and 0.822 (95% CI,
0.749-0.875) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The
calibration curve showed that the predicted probability of rebleeding was very
close to the actual probability. DCA verified the usefulness of the
Rad-scoreLiver-Spleen in clinical practice. The Rad-scoreLiver-Spleen showed good
performance in stratifying patients into high-, intermediate- and low-risk groups
in both the training and validation cohorts. The C-index of the
Rad-scoreLiver-Spleen in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) cohort was higher than that 
in the non-HBV cohort. Conclusion: The radiomics score extracted from liver and
spleen CT images can predict the risk of esophageal variceal rebleeding and
stratify cirrhotic patients accordingly.
