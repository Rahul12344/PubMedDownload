BACKGROUND: Bacterial infection is one of the most frequent complications in
acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which leads to high mortality. However, a 
specific prognostic model for ACLF patients with bacterial infection has not been
well established.
AIM: To establish and validate a nomogram for predicting 30-day mortality of
hepatitis B virus-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF) patients with bacterial infection.
METHODS: A total of 513 ACLF patients for HBV reactivation were enrolled in the
prospective cohort, and 224 patients with bacterial infection were for
derivation. Independent predictors were identified using multivariate logistic
model and then assembled into a nomogram to predict 30-day mortality. The
performance of the nomogram was assessed based on its calibration, discrimination
and clinical utility in a retrospective cohort of 192 HBV-ACLF patients with
bacterial infection.
RESULTS: Age, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, international normalized
ratio and soluble interleukin-2 receptor were shown to be independent risk
factors for 30-day mortality of HBV-ACLF patients with bacterial infection and
the nomogram was constructed. The nomogram showed a good calibration and
discrimination in the derivation cohort, with an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.883. Application of the nomogram in the
validation cohort also showed a good calibration and discrimination, with the AUC
of 0.852. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram was established and validated for predicting 30-day
mortality of HBV-ACLF patients with bacterial infection, which may facilitate
optimal therapeutic strategies to improve the prognosis of these patients.
