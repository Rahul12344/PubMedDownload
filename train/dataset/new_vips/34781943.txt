BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to cause
multiple organ damage; however, little attention has been paid to the damage to
the endocrine system caused by this virus, and the subsequent impact on
prognosis. This may be the first research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
(HPT) axis and prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, 235 patients were admitted to
the hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 22 January to 17
March 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatments were
obtained from electronic medical records with standard data collection forms and 
compared among patients with different thyroid function status.
RESULTS: Among 235 patients, 17 (7.23%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 11
(4.68%) severe non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and 23 (9.79%) mild to
moderate NTIS. Composite endpoint events of each group, including mortality,
admission to the ICU, and using IMV were observed. Compared with normal thyroid
function, the hazard ratios (HRs) of composite endpoint events for mild to
moderate NTIS, severe NTIS, subclinical hypothyroidism were 27.3 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 7.07-105.7), 23.1 (95% CI 5.75-92.8), and 4.04 (95% CI 0.69-23.8)
respectively. The multivariate-adjusted HRs for acute cardiac injury among
patients with NTF, subclinical hypothyroidism, severe NTIS, and mild to moderate 
NTIS were 1.00, 1.68 (95% CI 0.56-5.05), 4.68 (95% CI 1.76-12.4), and 2.63 (95%
CI 1.09-6.36) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the suppression of the HPT axis could be a
common complication in COVID-19 patients and an indicator of the severity of
prognosis. Among the three different types of thyroid dysfunction with COVID-19, 
mild to moderate NTIS and severe NTIS have a higher risk of severe outcomes
compared with subclinical hypothyroidism.
