Dengue virus infection mainly causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and/or dengue
shock syndrome (DSS). However, ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) is one of the
main pathogenic factors, and its pathogenic mechanism has not been fully
elucidated. Recently, with the development of high-throughput sequencing, an
increased number of RNAs have been confirmed to play a vital regulatory role in
the process of virus infection. However, there is a lack of research on dengue
virus infection and ADE. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to detect differentially 
expressed RNAs (DE RNAs) profiles in mock-infected, DENV-3-infected, and
ADE-infected THP-1 cells. Firstly, we found 69 circRNAs, 259 miRNAs, and 18 mRNAs
were differentially expressed in THP-1 vs DENV-3. In THP-1 vs ADE, 94 circRNAs,
263 miRNAs, and 111 mRNAs were differentially expressed. In DENV-3 vs ADE, 68
circRNAs, 105 miRNAs, and 94 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Functional
enrichment analysis of these DE RNAs mainly focused on immune system, viral
infectious diseases, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and NOD/RIG-I-like 
receptor signaling pathways. In DENV-3 vs ADE, notably, the expression of HBB was
up-regulated, which was a FcÎ³ Receptor-mediated phagocytosis protein.
Additionally, we predicted the encoding ability of DE circRNAs, and it was found 
that a small peptide was encoded by novel_circ_001562 and that its amino acid
sequence was consistent with that of DDX60L, which is a class of
interferon-stimulated genes. Finally, we constructed the ceRNA regulatory network
pathway. Therefore, our study provides a new strategy for further investigation
on DENV-host interactions.
