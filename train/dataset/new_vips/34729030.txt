Background: The ongoing global outbreak of new corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been
recognized as global public health concern since it causes high morbidity and
mortality every day. Due to the rapid spreading and re-emerging, we need to find 
a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2. Synthetic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine,
remdisivir have paid more attention and the effects of these drugs are still
under investigation, due to their severe side effects. Therefore, the aim of the 
present study was performed to identify the potential inhibitor against main
protease SARS-CoV-2 6LU7.
Objective: In this study, RO5, ADME properties, molecular dynamic simulations and
free binding energy prediction were mainly investigated.
Results: The molecular docking study findings revealed that andrographolide had
higher binding affinity among the selected natural diterpenoids compared to
co-crystal native ligand inhibitor N3. The persistent inhibition of Ki for
diterpenoids was analogous. Furthermore, the simulations of molecular dynamics
and free binding energy findings have shown that andrographolide possesses a
large amount of dynamic properties such as stability, flexibility and binding
energy.
Conclusion: In conclusion, findings of the current study suggest that selected
diterpenoids were predicted to be the significant phytonutrient-based inhibitor
against SARS-CoV-2 6LU7 (Mpro). However, preclinical and clinical trials are
needed for the further scientific validation before use.
