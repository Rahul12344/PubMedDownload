Carboxysomes are a family of bacterial microcompartments (BMCs), present in all
cyanobacteria and some proteobacteria, which encapsulate the primary CO2-fixing
enzyme, Rubisco, within a virus-like polyhedral protein shell. Carboxysomes
provide significantly elevated levels of CO2 around Rubisco to maximize
carboxylation and reduce wasteful photorespiration, thus functioning as the
central CO2-fixation organelles of bacterial CO2-concentration mechanisms. Their 
intriguing architectural features allow carboxysomes to make a vast contribution 
to carbon assimilation on a global scale. In this review, we discuss recent
research progress that provides new insights into the mechanisms of how
carboxysomes are assembled and functionally maintained in bacteria and recent
advances in synthetic biology to repurpose the metabolic module in diverse
applications.
