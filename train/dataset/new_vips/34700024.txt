We presented the case of stillbirth in a paucisymptomatic mother affected by
SARS-CoV-2. At gross examination, the placenta showed a diffuse marble appearance
and a focal hemorrhagic area. Multiple areas of hemorrhagic or ischemic necrosis 
with central and peripheral villous infarctions and thrombosis of several
maternal and fetal vessels with luminal fibrin and platelet deposition were
observed. All lesions seemed to be synchronous. Virus particles were identified
within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells using electron microscopy, whereas
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the placental tissue using real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Here, fetal vascular malperfusion was
associated with infection; in fact, electron microscopy images showed that marked
SARS-CoV-2 endotheliotropism involved the intravillous fetal capillaries.
Furthermore, we confirmed that syncytiotrophoblast is the major target cell type 
for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placenta. In conclusion, the possible
consequences of the action of the placentotropic SARS-CoV-2 included the
occurrence of vertical transmission, as reported in the literature, and/or
stillbirth: the latter possibility may be triggered by a hampered maternal and/or
fetal perfusion of the placenta. The diffuse thrombosis and subsequent ischemia
of fetal capillaries induced by COVID-19 cannot be predicted by standard clinical
surveillance.
