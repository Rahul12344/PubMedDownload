Objective: To identify markers that predict the progression to hepatitis B
virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF).
Methods: We recruited 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) between
September 2013 and March 2017. During hospitalization, 25 patients progressed to 
LF and were classified as the LF group, while the remaining 100 patients were
classified as the non-LF (NLF) group. We compared the kinetic changes in clinical
and immune indicators including age, total bilirubin level, prothrombin time,
model for end-stage liver disease score, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10
cytokine levels, and number of T helper 17 and regulatory T cells between groups 
to determine their association with progression to HBV-ACLF. The prognostic value
of clinical and immune indicators was determined using the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value.
Results: Cox regression analysis suggested that the plasma IL-6 level could
predict CHB progression to HBV-ACLF (relative risk = 1.082, 95% confidence
interval: 1.006-1.164; P=0.034). The AUC value, sensitivity, and specificity of
baseline IL-6 level for predicting HBV-ACLF were 82.63%, 83.3%, and 82.9%,
respectively (P=0.001).
Conclusion: A high plasma IL-6 level in CHB patients could be an early biomarker 
for HBV-ACLF.
