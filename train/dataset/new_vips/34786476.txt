The oncolytic effect of virotherapy derives from the intrinsic capability of the 
applied virus in selectively infecting and killing tumor cells. Although
oncolytic viruses of various constructions have been shown to efficiently infect 
and kill tumor cells in vitro, the efficiency of these viruses to exert the same 
effect on tumor cells within tumor tissues in vivo has not been extensively
investigated. Here we report our studies using single-cell RNA sequencing to
comprehensively analyze the gene expression profile of tumor tissues following
herpes simplex virus 2-based oncolytic virotherapy. Our data revealed the extent 
and cell types within the tumor microenvironment that could be infected by the
virus. Moreover, we observed changes in the expression of cellular genes,
including antiviral genes, in response to viral infection. One notable gene found
to be upregulated significantly in oncolytic virus-infected tumor cells was
Gadd45g, which is desirable for optimal virus replication. These results not only
help reveal the precise infection status of the oncolytic virus in vivo but also 
provide insight that may lead to the development of new strategies to further
enhance the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy.
