Utilizing population-based data from the Covid-19 phone survey ( N = 2 , 262 ) of
the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) collected during
June 2nd-August 17th, 2020, we focus on the crucial role that community
leadership and trust in institutions played in shaping behavioral, economic and
social responses to Covid-19 in this low-income sub-Saharan African context. We
argue that the effective response of Malawi to limit the spread of the virus was 
facilitated by the engagement of local leadership to mobilize communities to
adapt and adhere to Covid-19 prevention strategies. Using linear and ordered
probit models and controlling for time fixed effects, we show that village heads 
(VHs) played pivotal role in shaping individual's knowledge about the pandemic
and the adoption of preventive health behaviors and were crucial for mitigating
the negative economic and health consequences of the pandemic. We further show
that trust in institutions is of particular importance in shaping individuals'
behavior during the pandemic, and these findings highlight the pivotal role of
community leadership in fostering better compliance and adoption of public health
measures essential to contain the virus. Overall, our findings point to
distinctive patterns of pandemic response in a low-income sub-Saharan African
rural population that emphasized local leadership as mediators of public health
messages and policies. These lessons from the first pandemic wave remain relevant
as in many low-income countries behavioral responses to Covid-19 will remain the 
primary prevention strategy for a foreseeable future.
