This study aimed to determine the vector competence of bat-associated nycteribiid
flies (Eucamsipoda africana) for Marburg virus (MARV) in the Egyptian Rousette
Bat (ERB), Rousettus aegyptiacus. In flies fed on subcutaneously infected ERBs
and tested from 3 to 43 days post infection (dpi), MARV was detected only in
those that took blood during the peak of viremia, 5-7 dpi. Seroconversion did not
occur in control bats in contact with MARV-infected bats infested with bat flies 
up to 43 days post exposure. In flies inoculated intra-coelomically with MARV and
tested on days 0-29 post inoculation, only those assayed on day 0 and day 7 after
inoculation were positive by q-RT-PCR, but the virus concentration was consistent
with that of the inoculum. Bats remained MARV-seronegative up to 38 days after
infestation and exposure to inoculated flies. The first filial generation pupae
and flies collected at different times during the experiments were all negative
by q-RT-PCR. Of 1693 nycteribiid flies collected from a wild ERB colony in Mahune
Cave, South Africa where the enzootic transmission of MARV occurs, only one
(0.06%) tested positive for the presence of MARV RNA. Our findings seem to
demonstrate that bat flies do not play a significant role in the transmission and
enzootic maintenance of MARV. However, ERBs eat nycteribiid flies; thus, the
mechanical transmission of the virus through the exposure of damaged mucous
membranes and/or skin to flies engorged with contaminated blood cannot be ruled
out.
