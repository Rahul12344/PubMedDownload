The main purpose of this study was to explore people's perception on using social
media for crowdsourcing both information and support as part of COVID-19
response. Also, the study tried to find the possibility of social media
contributions to disaster management activities. A systematic research survey has
been conducted using a quantitative research approach with a sample of 437
respondents. The results indicated that social media played an important role in 
crowdsourcing information and support during the COVID-19 pandemic. People
regularly depended on social media platforms to get updated information and to
contribute to different disaster management response activities. According to the
findings, social media can greatly contribute to all the phases of disaster
management. Use of social media can be more comprehensive for managing disasters 
in future.
