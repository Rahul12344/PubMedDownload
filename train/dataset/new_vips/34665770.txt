The detection of SARS-CoV in wastewater has been proposed as a tool for
monitoring COVID-19 at the community level. Although many reports have been
published about detecting viral RNA in wastewater and its presence has been
linked to infected people, appropriate analytical methodologies to use this
approach have not yet been established. In this study, we compared
ultrafiltration, polyethylene glycol precipitation, flocculation using AlCl3, and
flocculation with skim milk for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2, using RNA from
patients with positive diagnoses for COVID-19 and Pseudomonas phage φ6 as the
control. We also evaluated the primers for detecting the E, RdRp, and N genes of 
the virus, as well as different storage times. Differences in the recovery
efficiencies were evident with the different concentration methods, the best
being ultrafiltration and precipitation with aluminum, which had recovery rates
of 42.0% and 30.0%, respectively, when virus was present at high levels.
Significant differences were found between the recoveries using wastewater and
deionized water and between different storage times, with better recoveries for 6
and 12 h samplings. The E gene was the only one detected in all the samples
analyzed. The results show that although this approach can provide important data
for studying the pandemic, clear protocols are necessary for investigations to be
comparable.
