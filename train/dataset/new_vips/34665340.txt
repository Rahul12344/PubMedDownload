OBJECTIVE: To compare the oral health status and oral health-related quality of
life (OHRQoL) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with human T-cell leukemia
virus-1 (HTLV-1).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 204 seropositive
patients, classified into two groups, symptomatic and asymptomatic. The first
group included patients with neurological symptoms associated with HTLV-1
(n = 69), and the second group, asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (n = 135). We
evaluated the total unstimulated saliva flow, oral mucosa, the Decayed, Missing, 
Filled Teeth (DMFT) index, and Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR). The
Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP14) measured the oral health-related quality of
life. General health-related quality of life was measured by the 36-Item
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Variables with a value of p < 0.25 in bivariate
analysis were selected, together with SF-36 summaries' scores and total OHIP-14, 
for composing a logistic regression model that had symptomatology as the
dependent variable.
RESULTS: The OHIP-14 total score was poor in symptomatic and asymptomatic groups,
but with no marked difference between them. Symptomatic patients showed
significantly lower SF-36 scores (P ≤ 0.05) compared to asymptomatic ones, except
for mental component summary (MCS). Family income (1-2.99 minimal wages), reduced
salivary flow, flossing, and lower physical component summary (PCS) were
associated (P ≤ 0.05) with symptomatology.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic individuals living with HTLV-1 showed lower HRQoL and
poorer OHRQoL compared to asymptomatic ones. Family income, flossing, reduced
salivary flow, and lower PCS were associated with symptomatic HTLV-1 individuals.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the present study, symptomatic individuals with HTLV-1
showed higher family income, poorer oral health status, lower salivary flow,
poorer OHRQoL, and lower HRQoL compared to asymptomatic ones.
