The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting effect on
emotional well-being of healthcare workers. Medical personnel working at the time
of the pandemic may experience elevated occupational stress due to the
uncontrollability of the virus, high perceived risk of infection, poor
understanding of the novel virus transmission routes and unavailability of
effective antiviral agents. This study used path analysis to analyze the
relationship between stress and alexithymia, emotional processing and
negative/positive affect in healthcare workers. The sample included 167 nurses,
65 physicians and 53 paramedics. Sixty-two (21.75 %) respondents worked in
COVID-19-designated hospitals. Respondents were administered the Toronto
Alexithymia Scale-20, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, Emotional Processing Scale,
and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The model showed excellent fit
indices (χ2 (2)=2.642, p=0.267; CFI=0.999, RMSEA=0.034, SRMR=0.015). Multiple
group path analysis demonstrated physicians differed from nurses and paramedics
at the model level (X2 diff (7)=14.155, p<0.05 and X2 diff (7)=18.642, p<0.01,
respectively). The relationship between alexithymia and emotional processing was 
stronger in nurses than in physicians (difference in beta=0.27; p<0.05).
Individual path χ2 tests also revealed significantly different paths across these
groups. The results of the study may be used to develop evidence-based
intervention programs promoting healthcare workers' mental health and well-being.
