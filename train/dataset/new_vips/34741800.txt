Liver transplantation (LT) from donors-with-HIV to recipients-with-HIV (HIV
D+/R+) is permitted under the HOPE Act. There are only three international
single-case reports of HIV D+/R+ LT, each with limited follow-up. We performed a 
prospective multicenter pilot study comparing HIV D+/R+ to donors-without-HIV to 
recipients-with-HIV (HIV D-/R+) LT. We quantified patient survival, graft
survival, rejection, serious adverse events (SAEs), human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) breakthrough, infections, and malignancies, using Cox and negative binomial
regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Between March
2016-July 2019, there were 45 LTs (8 simultaneous liver-kidney) at 9 centers: 24 
HIV D+/R+, 21 HIV D-/R+ (10 D- were false-positive). The median follow-up time
was 23 months. Median recipient CD4 was 287 cells/µL with 100% on antiretroviral 
therapy; 56% were hepatitis C virus (HCV)-seropositive, 13% HCV-viremic. Weighted
1-year survival was 83.3% versus 100.0% in D+ versus D- groups (p = .04). There
were no differences in one-year graft survival (96.0% vs. 100.0%), rejection
(10.8% vs. 18.2%), HIV breakthrough (8% vs. 10%), or SAEs (all p > .05). HIV
D+/R+ had more opportunistic infections, infectious hospitalizations, and cancer.
In this multicenter pilot study of HIV D+/R+ LT, patient and graft survival were 
better than historical cohorts, however, a potential increase in infections and
cancer merits further investigation.
