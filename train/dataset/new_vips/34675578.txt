Background: In the wake of coronavirus (COVID-19) global alert, people have begun
to practice safety measures in order to reduce the exposure to life-threatening
disease. The largest at risk population is undoubtedly the frontline healthcare
workers (HCWs) who are using personal protective equipment (PPE), essentially
face masks, to battle against this deadly virus. This study was conducted with
the prime intention to reveal an association between face mask and acne and
measure the prevalence of acne amongst HCWs amidst COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi. 
Furthermore, this study aimed to identify the type of mask generating acne,
locate the common sites, assess the severity and establish an association of mask
use with the skin type.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at Medicare Cardiac and
General Hospital, Jinnah Medical College Hospital, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical
Centre and Jamal Noor Hospital located in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 348 HCWs 
were interviewed, of which only 193 met the inclusion criteria. All information
was recorded on a predesigned proforma and analyzed using SPSS 25.0.
Results: Among 193 participants, acne was prevalent in 103 (53.4%) participants
with maximum cases reported in female HCWs, and in doctors (p<0.05). Out of 73
HCWs using N-95 masks, 46 (44.7%) developed acne, with a p-value of 0.036. Skin
type and past history of acne also yielded statistically significant results.
Among all the skin types, HCWs with oily skin (64, 62.1%) were prone to face
resurgence of acne or new-onset acne. The most common sites of eruption of acne
were along the cheeks (45.1%) followed by the nose (40.9%). Majority of the
population suffered from mild acne. Moderate and severe acne eruption was
particularly observed in those wearing N-95 and surgical masks.
Conclusion: The use of face masks is associated with high rates of acne eruption.
Disseminating the guidelines and indications of World Health Organization (WHO)
regarding proper use of mask, encouraging awareness among HCWs and following
proper doffing and donning protocol as endorsed by Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) will possibly minimize the adverse reactions.
