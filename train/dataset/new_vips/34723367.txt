The COVID-19 pandemic exposed numerous challenges in the emergency management
(EM) response system. The article contends that had EM deliberately and
systematically engaged in systems thinking; it would have been better able to
anticipate and respond to many of the challenges. Reasons for EM not fully
embracing systems thinking are discussed, including the perception that it is
complex and theoretical. This article attempts to dispel these beliefs by first
demonstrating how many systems-thinking concepts are already embedded in the EM
ethos and then by illustrating the application of system principles in the
context of the COVID-19 response. This article concludes by recommending EM
invest in training to encourage the systematic application of system principles
in emergency preparedness and response.
