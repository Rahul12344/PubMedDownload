Importance: Seroprevalence studies inform the extent of infection and assist
evaluation of mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of unidentified SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
general population of Hong Kong.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cross-sectional study was
conducted in Hong Kong after each major wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 21
to July 7, 2020; September 29 to November 23, 2020; and January 15 to April 18,
2021). Adults (age â‰¥18 years) who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 were
recruited during each period, and their sociodemographic information, symptoms,
travel, contact, quarantine, and COVID-19 testing history were collected.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay based on spike (S1/S2) protein, followed by confirmation with
a commercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassay based on the receptor binding
domain of spike protein.
Results: The study enrolled 4198 participants (2539 [60%] female; median age, 50 
years [IQR, 25 years]), including 903 (22%), 1046 (25%), and 2249 (53%) during
April 21 to July 7, 2020; during September 29 to November 23, 2020; and during
January 15 to April 18, 2021, respectively. The numbers of participants aged 18
to 39 years, 40 to 59 years, and 60 years or older were 1328 (32%), 1645 (39%),
and 1225 (29%), respectively. Among the participants, 2444 (58%) stayed in Hong
Kong since November 2019 and 2094 (50%) had negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results.
Only 170 (4%) reported ever having contact with individuals with confirmed cases,
and 5% had been isolated or quarantined. Most (2803 [67%]) did not recall any
illnesses, whereas 737 (18%), 212 (5%), and 385 (9%) had experienced respiratory 
symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or both, respectively, before testing. Six
participants were confirmed to be positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG; the adjusted 
prevalence of unidentified infection was 0.15% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.32%).
Extrapolating these findings to the whole population, there were fewer than 1.9
unidentified infections for every recorded confirmed case. The overall prevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong before the roll out of vaccination was less 
than 0.45%.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of participants from the
general public in Hong Kong, the prevalence of unidentified SARS-CoV-2 infection 
was low after 3 major waves of the pandemic, suggesting the success of the
pandemic mitigation by stringent isolation and quarantine policies even without
complete city lockdown. More than 99.5% of the general population of Hong Kong
remain naive to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the urgent need to achieve high vaccine 
coverage.
