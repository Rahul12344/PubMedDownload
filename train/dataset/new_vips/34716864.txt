BACKGROUND: The Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein, a multi-transmembrane domain
molecule, is critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption, and is the entry
factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri
chinensis) is closer to primates in terms of genetic evolution than rodents.
Previous studies indicated that the tree shrew was suitable for HCV research;
however, little is known about tree shrew NPC1L1.
METHODS AND RESULTS: TsNPC1L1 cDNA was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) technology. The cDNA sequence, its encoded protein structure, and
expression profile were analyzed. Results indicated that the tsNPC1L1 mRNA is
4948 bp in length and encodes a 1326 amino acid protein. TsNPC1L1 possesses
84.97% identity in homology to human NPC1L1 which is higher than both mouse
(80.37%) and rat (81.80%). The protein structure was also similar to human with
13 conserved transmembrane helices, and a sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Like human
NPC1L1, the tsNPC1L1 mRNA transcript is highly expressed in small intestine, but 
it was also well-expressed in the lung and pancreas of the tree shrew.
CONCLUSION: The homology of tree shrew NPC1L1 was closer to human than that of
rodent NPC1L1. The expression of tsNPC1L1 was the highest in small intestine, and
was detectable in lung and pancreas. These results may be useful in the study of 
tsNPC1L1 function in cholesterol absorption and HCV infection.
