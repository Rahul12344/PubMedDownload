Nowadays, one of the major global health concerns is coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even though numerous treatments and vaccines to combat this virus
are currently under development, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of this disease are yet to be elucidated to design future
therapeutic tools against SARS-CoV-2 variants. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small
(20-24 nucleotides), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate post-transcriptional 
gene expression. Recently, it has been demonstrated that both host and
viral-encoded miRNAs are crucial for the successful infection of SARS-CoV-2. For 
instance, dysregulation of miRNAs that modulate multiple genes expressed in
COVID-19 patients with comorbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, lung adenocarcinoma,
and cerebrovascular disorders) could affect the severity of the disease. Thus,
altered expression levels of circulating miRNAs might be helpful to diagnose this
illness and forecast whether a COVID-19 patient could develop a severe state of
the disease. Besides, researchers have found a number of miRNAs could inhibit the
expression of proteins, such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, spike, and Nsp12, involved in the 
life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, miRNAs represent potential biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for this devastating viral disease. Therefore, in this
current review, we present the recent discoveries regarding the clinical
relevance and biological roles of miRNAs in COVID-19.
