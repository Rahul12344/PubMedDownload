The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for single-use plastics that
intensifies pressure on an already out-of-control global plastic waste problem.
While it is suspected to be large, the magnitude and fate of this
pandemic-associated mismanaged plastic waste are unknown. Here, we use our MITgcm
ocean plastic model to quantify the impact of the pandemic on plastic discharge. 
We show that 8.4 ± 1.4 million tons of pandemic-associated plastic waste have
been generated from 193 countries as of August 23, 2021, with 25.9 ± 3.8 thousand
tons released into the global ocean representing 1.5 ± 0.2% of the global total
riverine plastic discharge. The model projects that the spatial distribution of
the discharge changes rapidly in the global ocean within 3 y, with a significant 
portion of plastic debris landing on the beach and seabed later and a circumpolar
plastic accumulation zone will be formed in the Arctic. We find hospital waste
represents the bulk of the global discharge (73%), and most of the global
discharge is from Asia (72%), which calls for better management of medical waste 
in developing countries.
