The COVID-19 pandemic has created novel barriers in providing and accessing all
forms of healthcare, including dentistry. The national dental response during the
first peak of the pandemic resulted in rapid changes in the provision of service,
to safeguard providers and users of dental care.Such rapidly leveraged changes
resulted in several issues in service delivery, requiring careful input from
managers and commissioners within NHS England and Improvement, trainees and
consultants in dental public health within Public Health England, and frontline
dental teams working across the health and social care system. The local response
from Lancashire and South Cumbria is outlined within this article.Teamwork,
communication and reflexive, iterative learning from these groups ensured the
delivery of an Urgent Dental Care service during the first lockdown of the
pandemic.The impact of COVID-19 has enabled considerable learning which will
inform future pandemic planning, alongside providing the opportunity to deliver
meaningful change within NHS dentistry as the service continues to recover.
