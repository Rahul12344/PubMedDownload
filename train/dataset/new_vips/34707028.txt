We surveyed mouse microbiological contamination rates by testing rates for common
contaminants using serological, culture, and parasitological methods. A total of 
21,292 experimentally housed mice from 206 animal facilities, including
hospitals, universities, companies, and research institutes, were tested over a
6-year period from 2014 to 2019. The most commonly found contaminants were
various species of nonpathogenic protozoa (47.2%). The most common pathogenic
bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (21.2%), Pasteurella pneumotropica (12.5%),
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.8%). Mouse hepatitis virus (6.1%) was detected, but
no other viral or bacterial pathogens were found. These results establish that
the main pathogens that currently contaminate mouse facilities in Korea are
opportunistic pathogens and that contamination with important pathogens, such as 
those in Categories B or C, has decreased.
