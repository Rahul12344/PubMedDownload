High case counts after the Gamma (P. 1) variant of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 emerged in Brazil raised concerns that previously infected
persons might become reinfected. Investigation of a cluster of coronavirus
disease cases in Parintins, in the Brazilian Amazon, suggested household
transmission but did not identify high rates of reinfection.
