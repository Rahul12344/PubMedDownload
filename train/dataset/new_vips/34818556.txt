Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious
disease with high fatality. Poor prognosis of SFTS has been associated with
dysregulated host immunity; however, the immune patterns associated with
pathophysiology involving SFTS exacerbation remain unclear. Here, we show that
the single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses is reprogrammed in SFTS 
and characterized by monocyte shift to an intermediate type along with complement
activation, perturbation of plasmablast composition, and highly exhausted
T cells, all correlated with lethal consequences. We identify the overexpression 
of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes across most immune cell types after SFTSV
infection, which are simultaneously related to older age, high viremia, and a
hyperinflammatory response. A retrospective clinical study reveals no efficiency 
of IFN-α in treating SFTS. These data collectively support the intermediate
monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts to be major targets for SFTS virus
infection, and they indicate the pivotal role of the IFN-I response in
exacerbating hyperinflammation and lethal SFTS.
