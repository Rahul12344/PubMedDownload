The present study aimed at assessing the consequences of prolonged exposure to
COVID-19 distress on mental health in non-frontline health care workers. For this
purpose, we have conducted a survey on 425 Italian dermatologists, in the period 
February-March 2021. The psychopathological symptoms, depression, anxiety,
post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD), as well as resilience, have been
evaluated. The main factors that influence the physician's psychological health
have been also investigated. Our study showed that the physicians older than 40
years, as well as those who lived this period in company, reported more personal 
resources, better managing the distress. Resilience, COVID-19 beliefs, COVID-19
working difficulties, and age were the common predictors of the severe
psychopathological symptoms. An interesting result is that the lower level of
resilience was the most powerful predictor of a more severe depression, as well
as of a higher severity of generalized anxiety disorder, but not of COVID-19
PTSD. The fear of COVID-19 was the most powerful predictor of COVID-19 PTSD. Home
conditions and previous SARS-CoV2 infection constituted significant predictors of
severe depressive symptoms, but not of anxiety and COVID-19 PTSD. These results
are useful in a better understanding of protective and risk factors involved in
COVID-19 long-term distress exposure.
