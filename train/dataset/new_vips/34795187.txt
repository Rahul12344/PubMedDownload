Stigma is a convoluted interaction between history, sociology, psychology,
medicine, anthropology, and politics. Often, stigma is inter-twined at
cognitive-emotional-behavioral level with a socio-cultural-economic-political
milieu and hence distinct from prejudice, discrimination or, stereotypy. Stigma
against diseases as a concept has evolved and has differed among various
illnesses. At this time of humanitarian crisis, it is prudent to understand the
concept, elements and models of stigma to tackle stigma against COVID-19
instrumentally. Stigma against COVID-19 can be partially extrapolated from
various models described in psychiatry for mental illness. We propose an
integrated socio-cognitive-emotional-behavioral model of stigma to conceptualize 
and understand the stigma against COVID-19, a matter of immense public health
significance.
