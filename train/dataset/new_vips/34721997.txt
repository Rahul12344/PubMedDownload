Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a dangerous virus causing
large piglet losses. PEDV spread rapidly between pig farms and caused the death
of up to 90% of infected piglets. Current vaccines are only partially effective
in providing immunity to suckling due to the rapid dissemination and ongoing
evolution of PEDV.
Methods: In this study, the complete genome of a PEDV strain in Vietnam 2018
(IBT/VN/2018 strain) has been sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of each fragment
was assembled to build a continuous complete sequence using the DNASTAR program. 
The complete nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences of S, N, and ORF3
genes were aligned and analyzed to detect the mutations.
Results: The full-length genome was determined with 28,031 nucleotides in length 
which consisted of the 5'UTR, ORF1ab, S protein, ORF3, E protein, M protein, N
protein, and 3'UTR region. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the IBT/VN/2018 
strain was highly virulent belonged to the G2b subgroup along with the Northern
American and Asian S-INDEL strains. Multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino 
acids revealed numerous mutations in the S, N, and ORF3 regions including one
substitution 766P > L766 in the epitope SS6; two in the S0subdomain (135DN136 >
135SI136 and N144> D144); two in subdomain SHR1 at aa 1009L > M1009 and 1089S >
L1089; one at aa 1279P > S1279 in subdomain SHR2 of the S protein; two at aa 364N
> I364 and 378N > S378 in the N protein; four at aa 25L > S25, 70I > V70, 107C > 
F107, and 168D > N168 in the ORF3 protein. We identified two insertions (at aa
59NQGV62 and aa 145N) and one deletion (at aa 168DI169) in S protein. Remarkable,
eight amino acid substitutions (294I > M294, 318A > S318, 335V > I335, 361A >
T361, 497R > T497, 501SH502 > 501IY502, 506I > T506, 682V > I682, and 777P >
L777) were found in SA subdomain. Besides, N- and O-glycosylation analysis of S, 
N, and ORF3 protein reveals three known sites (25G+, 123N+, and 62V+) and three
novel sites (144D+, 1009M+, and 1279L+) in the IBT/VN/2018 strain compared with
the vaccine strains. Taken together, the results showed that mutations in the S, 
N, and ORF3 genes can affect receptor specificity, viral pathogenicity, and the
ability to evade the host immune system of the IBT/VN/2018 strain. Our results
highlight the importance of molecular characterization of field strains of PEDV
for the development of an effective vaccine to control PEDV infections in
Vietnam.
