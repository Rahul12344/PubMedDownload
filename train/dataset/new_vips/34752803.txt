The highest viral loads of the newly emerged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are detectable in the oral cavity, thus, a potential
reduction of infectious virus by nasal sprays could lower transmission.
Therefore, the inactivation capacity of nine nasal and oral sprays was evaluated 
according to EN 14476. One nasal spray based on sodium hypochlorite and an oral
spray containing essential oils reduced viral titres between 2 to 3 orders of
magnitude. Although clinical data is still sparse, nasal and oral sprays display 
a more convenient application for elderly people or those who are unable to
rinse/gargle.
