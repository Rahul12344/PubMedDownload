Early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been an accepted indication for
liver transplantation now for over 20 years. Allocation policy in the United
States (US) has been continually refined to maintain equity and optimize the
utility of transplant for HCC, yet all patients qualifying for HCC exception
still receive the same number of points. This group is quite heterogeneous, with 
varying risk of waitlist dropout dependent on tumor characteristics including
number and size of lesions and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, as well as baseline
liver function. In addition, changing demographics of liver disease, including
the rising incidence of NASH, effective antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus, 
and earlier detection of HCC due to improved screening programs and awareness,
may influence the overall survival benefit to liver transplantation.
