BACKGROUND: To determine the effect of lockdown measures on lung transplant
patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We collected data from Croatian lung transplant patients
before and after the lockdown and analyzed changes in weight, BMI, lung function 
and blood lipid status.
RESULTS: An average increase of 3.74 kg (+4.92%) body weight during the 4 month
lockdown period was observed. Lung function values and blood lipid status
remained stable.
CONCLUSION: Such weight gain could have detrimental effects on the morbidity and 
mortality of lung transplant patients. Further follow up is needed to determine
the long term impacts of this observation.
