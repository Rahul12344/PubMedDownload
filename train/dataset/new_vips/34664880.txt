ABSTRACT: Mumps is an acute and common childhood disease caused by paramyxovirus.
It has been reported that the occurrence of mumps is influenced by seasonality.
However, the role of meteorological variables in the incidence of mumps remains
unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between
meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps infection. Poisson regression
analysis was used to study the relationship between weather variability and the
incidence of mumps in Taiwan. Between 2012 and 2018, 5459 cases of mumps cases
were reported to the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan (Taiwan CDC). The
occurrence of mumps virus infections revealed significant seasonality in the
spring and summer seasons in Taiwan. The incidence of mumps virus infections
began to increase at temperatures of 15°C and started to decline if the
temperature was higher than 29°C (r2 = 0.387, P = .008). Similarly, the number of
mumps cases began to increase at a relative humidity of 65% to 69% (r2 = 0.838,
P < .029). The number of mumps cases was positively associated with temperature
and relative humidity during the period preceding the infection. This study
showed that the occurrence of mumps is significantly associated with increasing
temperature and relative humidity in Taiwan. Therefore, these factors could be
regarded as early warning signals and indicate the need to strengthen the
intervention and prevention of mumps.
