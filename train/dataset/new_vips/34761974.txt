This article is an analytical reflection of the personal health journey of a
first-year nursing student that was undertaken as part of a first-year unit of
study. Focusing on social, physical and psychological aspects of health, it
explores the impact of the cessation of exercise on her emotional and physical
health and wellbeing. This is relevant to current practice as a result of
COVID-19, which reduced opportunities for exercise for many people, whether
because of self-isolation and lockdown restrictions on leisure facilities or
increased workload and caring responsibilities, all of which affect health and
wellbeing. The article is presented in the first person, reflecting the personal 
analysis it captures.
