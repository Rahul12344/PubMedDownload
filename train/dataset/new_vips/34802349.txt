PURPOSE: To retrospectively review the clinical characteristics of patients with 
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) blepharokeratoconjunctivitis.
METHODS: Laboratory-proven HSV-2 blepharokeratoconjunctivitis cases were reviewed
between 1995 and 2021.
RESULTS: 10 of 725 (1.4%) patients had HSV-2 infection. Data was available for 9 
patients. Associated conditions included neonatal herpes (1/9, 11%), severe atopy
(1/9, 11%), genital herpes (2/9, 22%), and systemic immune disorders (2/9, 22%). 
The most common presenting finding was pain and blurred vision (55.5%). Two
patients (22%) had dendritic lesions and one patient (11%) had reduced corneal
sensation. Complete resolution was reported in four patients (44.5%). Recurrence 
was noted in four patients (44.5%) despite antiviral prophylaxis. Corneal
complications included scarring and neovascularization. The visual acuity at the 
last follow-up was 20/40 or worse in four patients (44.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: HSV-2 is an uncommon cause of keratitis. Dendrites and loss of
corneal sensation were uncommon. Recurrence was noted despite antiviral
prophylaxis.
