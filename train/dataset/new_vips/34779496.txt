The devastating complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) result from 
the dysfunctional immune response of an individual following the initial severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) infection. Multiple toxic
stressors and behaviors contribute to underlying immune system dysfunction.
SARS‑CoV‑2 exploits the dysfunctional immune system to trigger a chain of events,
ultimately leading to COVID‑19. The authors have previously identified a number
of contributing factors (CFs) common to myriad chronic diseases. Based on these
observations, it was hypothesized that there may be a significant overlap between
CFs associated with COVID‑19 and gastrointestinal cancer (GIC). Thus, in the
present study, a streamlined dot‑product approach was used initially to identify 
potential CFs that affect COVID‑19 and GIC directly (i.e., the simultaneous
occurrence of CFs and disease in the same article). The nascent character of the 
COVID‑19 core literature (~1‑year‑old) did not allow sufficient time for the
direct effects of numerous CFs on COVID‑19 to emerge from laboratory experiments 
and epidemiological studies. Therefore, a literature‑related discovery approach
was used to augment the COVID‑19 core literature‑based 'direct impact' CFs with
discovery‑based 'indirect impact' CFs [CFs were identified in the non‑COVID‑19
biomedical literature that had the same biomarker impact pattern
(e.g., hyperinflammation, hypercoagulation, hypoxia, etc.) as was shown in the
COVID‑19 literature]. Approximately 2,250 candidate direct impact CFs in common
between GIC and COVID‑19 were identified, albeit some being variants of the same 
concept. As commonality proof of concept, 75 potential CFs that appeared
promising were selected, and 63 overlapping COVID‑19/GIC potential/candidate CFs 
were validated with biological plausibility. In total, 42 of the 63 were
overlapping direct impact COVID‑19/GIC CFs, and the remaining 21 were candidate
GIC CFs that overlapped with indirect impact COVID‑19 CFs. On the whole, the
present study demonstrates that COVID‑19 and GIC share a number of common
risk/CFs, including behaviors and toxic exposures, that impair immune function. A
key component of immune system health is the removal of those factors that
contribute to immune system dysfunction in the first place. This requires a
paradigm shift from traditional Western medicine, which often focuses on
treatment, rather than prevention.
