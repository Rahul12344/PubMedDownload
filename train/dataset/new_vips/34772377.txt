BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes
the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by a
diverse clinical picture. Children are often asymptomatic or experience mild
symptoms and have a milder disease course compared to adults. Rectal shedding of 
SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in both adults and children, suggesting the
fecal-oral route as a potential route of transmission. However, only a few
studies have investigated this in neonates. We present a neonate with a mild
disease course and prolonged rectal SARS-CoV-2 shedding.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-day old neonate was admitted to the hospital with
tachycardia and a family history of COVID-19. The boy later tested positive for
COVID-19. His heart rate normalized overnight without intervention , but a grade 
1/6 heart murmur on the left side of the sternum was found. After excluding signs
of heart failure, the boy was discharged in a habitual state after three days of 
admission. During his admission, he was enrolled in a clinical study examining
the rectal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. He was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in his
pharyngeal swabs for 11 days after initial diagnosis and remained positive in his
rectal swabs for 45 days. Thereby, the boy remained positive in his rectal swabs 
for 29 days after his first negative pharyngeal swab.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented case shows that neonates with a mild disease course
can shed SARS-CoV-2 in the intestines for 45 days. In the current case, it was
not possible to determine if fecal-oral transfer to the family occurred, and more
research is needed to establish the potential risk of the fecal-oral transmission
route.
