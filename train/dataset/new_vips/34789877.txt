Neurotropic alphaherpesviruses initiate infection in exposed mucosal tissues and,
unlike most viruses, spread rapidly to sensory and autonomic nerves where
life-long latency is established1. Recurrent infections arise sporadically from
the peripheral nervous system throughout the life of the host, and invasion of
the central nervous system may occur, with severe outcomes2. These viruses
directly recruit cellular motors for transport along microtubules in nerve axons,
but how the motors are manipulated to deliver the virus to neuronal nuclei is not
understood. Here, using herpes simplex virus type I and pseudorabies virus as
model alphaherpesviruses, we show that a cellular kinesin motor is captured by
virions in epithelial cells, carried between cells, and subsequently used in
neurons to traffic to nuclei. Viruses assembled in the absence of kinesin are not
neuroinvasive. The findings explain a critical component of the alphaherpesvirus 
neuroinvasive mechanism and demonstrate that these viruses assimilate a cellular 
protein as an essential proviral structural component. This principle of viral
assimilation may prove relevant to other virus families and offers new strategies
to combat infection.
