Valve vegetation is one of the most fearful findings for physicians. The first
diagnosis that comes to their mind is infective endocarditis (IE), but it can
also be noninfective; nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). NBTE can be
even more challenging than IE for physicians because of the wide range of
differential diagnoses such as malignancies, autoimmune disorders and human
immunodeficiency virus. A 45-year-old woman presented at the emergency room with 
a sudden onset of dysarthria and right-sided hemiplegia. Laboratory data showed
her blood counts and coagulation test were mostly normal and the magnetic
resonance imaging detected a high-signal-intensity change in her left brain. An
echocardiogram found a vegetation-like structure on her atrial valve. We highly
suspected IE leading to cerebral embolism. The clot was successfully removed by
our neurosurgeons and anticoagulation therapy was started concurrently. Her state
of consciousness improved, but then she suffered a brain hemorrhage and died. The
autopsy revealed that the cause of her vegetation was acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL). Based on these findings, it is important to remember that APL can
be the cause of NBTE even if the blood count and coagulation tests are almost
normal.
