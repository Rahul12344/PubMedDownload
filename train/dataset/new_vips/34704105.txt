Background: To determine the kinetics and persistence of immune responses
following the Sinopharm/BBIBP-CorV, we investigated immune responses in a cohort 
of Sri Lankan individuals.
Methods: SARS-CoV-2 specific total antibodies were measured in 20-to-39 year
(n=61), 40-to-59-year and those >60 years of age (n=22) by ELISA, 12 weeks after 
the second dose of the vaccine. ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies (ACE2R-Ab),
antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the ancestral virus (WT) and
variants of concern, were measured in a sub cohort. T cell responses and memory B
cell responses were assessed by ELISpot assays.
Results: 193/203 (95.07%) of individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific total
antibodies, while 67/110 (60.9%) had ACE2R-Ab. 14.3% to 16.7% individuals in the 
20 to 39 age groups had detectable antibodies to the RBD of the WT and VOC, while
the positivity rates of those >60 years of age was <10%. 14/49 (28.6%) had IFN γ 
ELISpot responses to overlapping peptides of the spike protein, while memory B
cell responses were detected in 9/20 to the S1 recombinant protein. The total
antibody levels and ACE2R-Ab declined after 2 to 12 weeks from the second dose,
while ex vivo T cell responses remained unchanged. The decline in ACE2R-Ab levels
was significant among the 40 to 59 (p=0.0007) and ≥60 (p=0.005) age groups.
Conclusions: Antibody responses declined in all age groups, especially in those
>60 years, while T cell responses persisted. The effect of waning of immunity on 
hospitalization and severe disease should be assessed by long term efficacy
studies.
