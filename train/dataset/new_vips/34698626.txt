Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are increasingly becoming the main cause of
transmissible gastroenteritis worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of deaths
recorded annually. Yet, decades after their discovery, there is still no
effective treatment or vaccine. Efforts aimed at developing vaccines or treatment
will benefit from a greater understanding of norovirus-host interactions,
including the host response to infection. In this review, we provide a concise
overview of the evidence establishing the significance of type I and type III
interferon (IFN) responses in the restriction of noroviruses. We also critically 
examine our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IFN induction in
norovirus-infected cells, and outline the diverse strategies deployed by
noroviruses to supress and/or avoid host IFN responses. It is our hope that this 
review will facilitate further discussion and increase interest in this area.
