BACKGROUND: The novel SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the most recent pandemic faced 
by humanity, has become a global crisis causing millions of deaths. The virus is 
transmitted by inhalation of infectious particles suspended in the air, direct
deposition on mucous membranes and indirect contact via contaminated surfaces.
Therefore, disinfection methods that can halt such transmission are important in 
this pandemic and in future viral infections.
AIM: Highlight the efficacy of several disinfection methods against SARS-CoV-2,
based on up-to-date evidence found in literature.
METHODS: A research was conducted through two databases to assess the
disinfection methods used against SARS-CoV-2. From a total of 1229 studies found,
60 were included. Quality assessment was evaluated by the OHAT risk of bias tool.
FINDINGS: Disinfection methods on environmental surfaces were approached by 28
studies; 16 articles addressed disinfection methods used on biological surfaces; 
4 articles presented disinfection methods for airborne coronavirus and 16 studies
demonstrated methods used to recondition PPEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Several household and hospital disinfection agents and UV-C
irradiation were effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces. 
Formulations containing povidone-iodine can provide virucidal action on the skin 
and mucous membranes. In the case of hand hygiene, typical soap bars and alcohols
can inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Air filtration systems incorporated with materials
that possess catalytic properties, UV-C devices and heating systems can
effectively reduce airborne viral particles. The decontamination of PPEs can be
conducted safely by heat and ozone treatment.
