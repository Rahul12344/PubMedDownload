There is no doubt that the events of the past two years will leave an indelible
mark on human history. The tragic loss of so many lives during the COVID-19
pandemic, the long-term health and psychological impacts for many more and the
economic and societal changes will reverberate for years to come. While the
pandemic is not yet over, we are starting to appreciate how different our new
future looks and feels. It is within this context that Longwoods Publishing and
the Canadian College of Health Leaders (CCHL) have collaborated, for the first
time, in a shared reflection on the future of leadership in Canada's healthcare
system.
