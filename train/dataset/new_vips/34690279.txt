PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The main purpose of this review is to present newly reported
cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis, updates in investigations to
verify systemic involvement in cases with cutaneous vasculitis and new
therapeutic guidelines. The spectrum of COVID-19-related vasculitis is also
covered.
RECENT FINDINGS: Only a few reports highlighted new cutaneous presentations or
associations with some systemic vasculitic entities. For example, the association
of inflammatory disorders with Takayasu arteritis, the importance of considering 
Kawasaki disease in febrile children with erythema nodosum, the development of
necrotic ulcers on fingers and toes in Behçet's disease and the possible presence
of polyarteritis nodosa-like pathological features in vulvar ulcers of Behçet's
disease. New attempts to classify cutaneous manifestations of giant cell
arteritis (GCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis
(AAV) and the diagnostic investigations for cutaneous vasculitis cases to verify 
systemic involvement are discussed. Treatment of systemic vasculitis with
cutaneous vasculitis should be tailored according to disease status. A plethora
of reports in the past 2 years focused on the broad spectrum of COVID-19
vasculitic manifestations.
SUMMARY: Although newly reported cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis 
are relatively uncommon, the plethora of reports in the past 2 years on COVID-19 
vasculitis necessitates the expansion of the classification of vasculitis
associated with probable cause to include severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) vasculitis.
