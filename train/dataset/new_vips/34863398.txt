The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly
transmissible virus with significant global impact, morbidity, and mortality. The
SARS-CoV-2 virus may result in widespread organ manifestations including acute
respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, thromboembolism, and
myocarditis. Virus-induced endothelial injury may cause endothelial activation,
increased permeability, inflammation, and immune response and cytokine storm.
Endothelial dysfunction is a systemic disorder that is a precursor of
atherosclerotic vascular disease that is associated with cardiovascular risk
factors and is highly prevalent in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular
and peripheral disease. Several studies have associated various viral infections 
including SARS-CoV-2 infection with inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and
subsequent innate immune response and cytokine storm. Noninvasive monitoring of
endothelial function and identification of high-risk patients who may require
specific therapies may have the potential to improve morbidity and mortality
associated with subsequent inflammation, cytokine storm, and multiorgan
involvement.
