The innate immune system is comprised of both cellular and humoral players that
recognise and eradicate invading pathogens. Therefore, the interplay between
retroviruses and innate immunity has emerged as an important component of viral
pathogenesis. HIV-1 infection in humans that results in hematologic abnormalities
and immune suppression is well represented by changes in the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio
and consequent cell death causing CD4 lymphopenia. The innate immune responses by
mucosal barriers such as complement, DCs, macrophages, and NK cells as well as
cytokine/chemokine profiles attain great importance in acute HIV-1 infection, and
thus, prevent mucosal capture and transmission of HIV-1. Conversely, HIV-1 has
evolved to overcome innate immune responses through RNA-mediated rapid mutations,
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) modification, down-regulation of
NK cell activity and complement receptors, resulting in increased secretion of
inflammatory factors. Consequently, epithelial tissues lining up female
reproductive tract express innate immune sensors including anti-microbial
peptides responsible for forming primary barriers and have displayed an effective
potent anti-HIV activity during phase I/II clinical trials.
