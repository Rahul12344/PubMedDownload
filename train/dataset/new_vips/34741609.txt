BACKGROUND: Deep sequencing could improve understanding of HIV treatment failure 
and viral population dynamics. However, this tool is often inaccessible in low-
and middle-income countries.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the genetic patterns of resistance emerging in West
African HIV-1 subtypes during first-line virological failure, and the
implications for future antiretroviral options.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were selected from a Nigerian cohort of people
living with HIV who had failed first-line ART and subsequently switched to
second-line therapy. Whole HIV-1 genome sequences were generated from first-line 
virological failure samples with Illumina MiSeq. Mutations detected at ≥2%
frequency were analysed and compared by subtype.
RESULTS: HIV-1 sequences were obtained from 101 participants (65% female, median 
age 30 years, median 32.9 months of nevirapine- or efavirenz-based ART).
Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) were detected in 61%, other core NRTI
mutations in 92% and NNRTI mutations in 99%. Minority variants (<20% frequency)
comprised 18% of all mutations. K65R was more prevalent in CRF02_AG than G
subtypes (33% versus 7%; P = 0.002), and ≥3 TAMs were more common in G than
CRF02_AG (52% versus 24%; P = 0.004). Subtype G viruses also contained more RT
cleavage site mutations. Cross-resistance to at least one of the newer NNRTIs,
doravirine, etravirine or rilpivirine, was predicted in 81% of participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Extensive drug resistance had accumulated in people with West
African HIV-1 subtypes, prior to second-line ART. Deep sequencing significantly
increased the detection of resistance-associated mutations. Caution should be
used if considering newer-generation NNRTI agents in this setting.
