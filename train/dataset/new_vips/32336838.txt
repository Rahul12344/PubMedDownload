Monolaurin alone and monolaurin with tert-butylhydroxyanisole (BHA),
methylparaben, or sorbic acid were tested for in vitro virucidal activity against
14 human RNA and DNA enveloped viruses in cell culture. At concentrations of 1%
additive in the reaction mixture for 1 h at 23Â°C, all viruses were reduced in
infectivity by >99.9%. Monolaurin with BHA was the most effective virucidal agent
in that it removed all measurable infectivity from all of the viruses tested. The
compounds acted similarly on all the viruses and reduced infectivity by
disintegrating the virus envelope.
