Maize striate mosaic virus (MSMV; genus Mastrevirus), was recently reported in
maize plants in Brazil, and also detected by metagenomic analyses in the corn
leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong & Wolcott). Although these findings suggested
that D. maidis is a potential vector, no transmission studies have been
performed. Here, we tested the transmission of MSMV by D. maidis from
field-collected infected plants and plants infected with MSMV via
leafhopper-mediated transmission in the laboratory; all plants were confirmed
positive for MSMV by PCR. In each one of three transmission replicates,
aviruliferous D. maidis nymphs and adults were confined together on a source
plant during a 4-day acquisition access period (AAP), and subsequently
transferred to healthy maize seedlings (10 individuals per test plant) in a
series of 4-day inoculation access periods (IAPs). We also tested transmission by
the corn aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) and by mechanical inoculation of
healthy maize seedlings. Only D. maidis transmitted MSMV, with overall
transmission rates of 29.4 and 39.5% using field-collected infected plants, and
18.5% using infected plants in laboratory. D. maidis transmitted MSMV until the
third (8-12 days after the AAP) or fourth successive IAP (12-16 days) with
gradual loss in transmission efficiency and rate of viruliferous insects over
time, suggesting a persistent, but non-propagative mode of transmission. Infected
test plants showed mottling symptoms with mild chlorotic streaks and height
reduction. This is the first report of transmission of a mastrevirus by D.
maidis, facilitating the completion of Koch's postulate for MSMV.
