Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the larynx is an extremely rare tumour which,
unlike its nasopharyngeal counterpart, has shown a propensity to affect elderly
Caucasian men and is not commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus. We present 
a 70-year-old Chinese man who complained of hoarseness and dysphagia.
Nasoendoscopy revealed a left supraglottic tumour. Preoperative MRI (in
particular Diffusion Weighted Imaging) showed the possibility of two distinct
components within a tumour. The patient underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy and 
bilateral selective neck dissection. The final histology report confirmed the
presence of a tumour with two distinct components: predominant LEC with a smaller
conventional (keratinising) squamous cell carcinoma component. The patient
recovered well after surgery and subsequently underwent adjuvant radiotherapy.
Final staging was pT3 N2c M0 (AJCC stage IVA). Follow-up over 2 years revealed no
tumour recurrence.
