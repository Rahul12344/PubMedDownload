The consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, minerals including
carotenoids etc. can boost the immune system to help fight off various infections
including SARS- CoV 2 and other viruses. Carotenoids have been gaining attention 
particularly in food and pharmaceutical industries owing to their diverse
functions including their role as pro-vitamin A activity, potent antioxidant
properties, and quenching of reactive oxygen (ROS), such as singlet oxygen and
lipid peroxides within the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Nevertheless,
carotenoids being lipophilic, have poor solubility in aqueous medium and are also
chemically instable. They are susceptible to degrade under stimuli environmental 
conditions during food processing, storage and gastrointestinal passage. They
also exhibit poor oral bioavailability, thus, their applications in aqueous-based
foods are limited. As a consequent, suitable delivery systems including
colloids-based are needed to enhance the solubility, stability and
bioavailability of carotenoids. This review presents challenges of incorporation 
and delivery of carotenoids focusing on stability and factors affecting
bioavailability. Furthermore, designed factors impacting bioaccessibility and
bioavailability of carotenoids using emulsion-based delivery systems are
explicitly explained. Each delivery system exhibits its own advantages and
disadvantages; thus, the delivery systems should be designed based on their
targets and their further applications.
