Antibody-Framework-to-Antigen Distance (AFAD) - the distance between the body of 
an antibody and a protein antigen - is an important parameter governing antibody 
recognition. Here, we quantify AFAD for ~2,000 non-redundant
antibody-protein-antigen complexes in the Protein Data Bank. AFADs showed a
gaussian distribution with mean of 16.3 Å and standard deviation (σ) of 2.4 Å.
Notably, antibody-antigen complexes with extended AFADs (>3σ) were exclusively
human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)-neutralizing antibodies. High
correlation (R2 = 0.8110) was observed between AFADs and glycan coverage, as
assessed by molecular dynamics simulations of the HIV-1-envelope trimer.
Especially long AFADs were observed for antibodies targeting the glycosylated
trimer apex, and we tested the impact of introducing an apex-glycan hole (N160K);
the cryo-EM structure of the glycan hole-targeting HIV-1-neutralizing antibody
2909 in complex with an N160K-envelope trimer revealed a substantially shorter
AFAD. Overall, extended AFADs exclusively recognized densely glycosylated
surfaces, with the introduction of a glycan hole enabling closer recognition.
