GPCR-Gα protein-mediated signal transduction contributes to spatiotemporal
interactions between immune cells to fine-tune and facilitate the process of
inflammation and host protection. Beyond this, however, how Gα proteins
contribute to the helper T cell subset differentiation and adaptive response have
been underappreciated. Here, we found that Gα13 signaling in T cells plays a
crucial role in inducing follicular helper T (Tfh) cell differentiation in vivo. 
T cell-specific Gα13-deficient mice have diminished Tfh cell responses in a
cell-intrinsic manner in response to immunization, lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus infection, and allergen challenges. Moreover, Gα13-deficient Tfh cells
express reduced levels of Bcl-6 and CXCR5 and are functionally impaired in their 
ability to adhere to and stimulate B cells. Mechanistically, Gα13-deficient Tfh
cells harbor defective Rho-ROCK2 activation, and Rho agonist treatment
recuperates Tfh cell differentiation and expression of Bcl-6 and CXCR5 in Tfh
cells of T cell-specific Gα13-deficient mice. Conversely, ROCK inhibitor
treatment hampers Tfh cell differentiation in wild-type mice. These findings
unveil a crucial regulatory role of Gα13-Rho-ROCK axis in optimal Tfh cell
differentiation and function, which might be a promising target for pharmacologic
intervention in vaccine development as well as antibody-mediated immune
disorders.
