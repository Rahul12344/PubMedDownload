Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive T- or NK-cell neoplasms show progressive
systemic inflammation and abnormal blood coagulation causing hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). It was reported that inflammatory cytokines were
produced and secreted by EBV-positive neoplastic T- or NK-cells. These cytokines 
can induce the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages leading to HLH. To
clarify which products of EBV-positive neoplastic T- or NK-cells have effects on 
monocytes, we performed a co-culture assay of monocytes with the supernatants of 
EBV-positive T- or NK-cell lines. The expression of differentiation markers, the 
phagocytosis ability, and the mRNA expression of the inflammatory cytokines of
THP-1, a monocytic cell line, clearly increased after culturing with the
supernatants from EBV-NK-cell lines. Co-culturing with the supernatants promoted 
the expression of CD80 and CD206 as well as M1 and M2 macrophage markers in human
monocytes. Co-culturing with the supernatants of EBV-NK-cell lines significantly 
enhanced the procoagulant activity and the tissue factor expression of monocytes.
Interferon (IFN)-γ was elevated extremely not only in the supernatant of
EBV-NK-cell lines but also in the plasma of EBV-positive NK-cell neoplasms
patients accompanying HLH. Finally, we confirmed that IFN-γ directly enhanced the
differentiation into M1-like macrophages and the procoagulant activity of
monocytes. Our findings suggest that IFN-γ may potentially serve as a therapeutic
target to regulate HLH in EBV-positive NK-cell neoplasms.
