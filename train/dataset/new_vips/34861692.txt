Fibro-osseous pseudotumor of the digit is an unusual benign tumor that appears on
the extremities. A 45-year-old, human immunodeficiency virus-positive man
presented with a painful lesion on the tip of the fourth toe of his right foot.
The tumor was completely excised without any connection to the underlying bone
being observed, although the phalanx had to be extirpated. Histopathology
confirmed the diagnosis of fibro-osseous pseudotumor. At the follow-up visit, 12 
months later, no abnormalities were found.
