With the emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, drug repurposing studies have
gained substantial importance. Combined with the efficacy of recent improvements 
in ligand- and target-based virtual screening approaches, virtual screening has
become faster and more productive than ever. In the current study, an FDA library
of approved drugs and compounds under clinical investigation were screened for
their antiviral activity using the antiviral therapeutic activity binary QSAR
model of the MetaCore/MetaDrug platform. Among 6733-compound collection, we found
370 compounds with a normalized therapeutic activity value greater than a cutoff 
of 0.75. Only these selected compounds were used for molecular docking studies
against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). After initial short (10 ns)
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the top-50 docking scored compounds and 
following molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA)
calculations, top-10 compounds were subjected to longer (100 ns) MD simulations
and end-point MM/GBSA estimations. Our virtual screening protocol yielded
Cefuroxime pivoxetil, an ester prodrug of second-generation cephalosporin
antibiotic Cefuroxime, as being a considerable molecule for drug repurposing
against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
