BACKGROUND: There is controversy regarding the role of in-person attendance in
schools and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several studies have
demonstrated no increase in transmission, while some have reported large
outbreaks with in-person attendance. We determined the incidence and risk factors
for SARS-CoV-2 infection among school staff after one school term.
METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and blood for
SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were obtained from staff at a large international
school in Qatar at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year and repeated at the
end of the first term.
RESULTS: A total of 376 staff provided samples for testing. At the beginning of
the 2020-2021 school year, the PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 13%, while
seropositivity was 30.1%. A majority of those who tested positive either by PCR
or serologically, were non-teaching staff. At the end of the first school term
four months later, only 3.5% of the initially antibody-negative staff had
seroconverted. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, male gender (OR
11.48, 95%CI 4.77-27.64), non-teaching job category (OR 3.09, 95%CI 1.10-8.64),
contact with a confirmed case (OR 20.81, 95%CI 2.90-149.18), and presence of
symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks [1-2 symptoms OR 4.82, 95%CI 1.79-12.94); ≥3
symptoms OR 42.30, 95%CI 3.76-476.43) independently predicted SARS-CoV-2
infection in school staff before school starting.
CONCLUSION: Male gender, non-teaching job, presence of symptoms, and exposure to 
a confirmed case were associated with higher risk of infection. These data can
help policymakers in determining the optimal strategy for school reopening.
