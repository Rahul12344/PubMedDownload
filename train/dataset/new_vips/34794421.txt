BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed inequities in our society, 
demonstrated by disproportionate COVID-19 infection rate and mortality in
communities of color and low-income communities. One key area of inequity that
has yet to be explored is disparities based on preferred language.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 164,368 adults tested for
COVID-19 in a large healthcare system across Washington, Oregon, and California
from March - July 2020. Using electronic health records, we constructed
multi-level models that estimated the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 by
preferred language, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and social factors. We
further investigated interaction between preferred language and both
race/ethnicity and state. Analysis was performed from October-December 2020.
RESULTS: Those whose preferred language was not English had higher odds of having
a COVID-19 positive test (OR 3.07, p < 0.001); this association remained
significant after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and social factors. We found
significant interaction between language and race/ethnicity and language and
state, but the odds of COVID-19 test positivity remained greater for those whose 
preferred language was not English compared to those whose preferred language was
English within each race/ethnicity and state.
CONCLUSIONS: People whose preferred language is not English are at greater risk
of testing positive for COVID-19 regardless of age, race/ethnicity, geography, or
social factors - demonstrating a significant inequity. Research demonstrates that
our public health and healthcare systems are centered on English speakers,
creating structural and systemic barriers to health. Addressing these barriers
are long overdue and urgent for COVID-19 prevention.
