Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen posing global health
burden, and the concerns in Europe are tremendously growing. Pigs serve as a main
reservoir, contributing to pork-related foodborne transmission. In this study, we
aim to specifically simulate this foodborne transmission route and to assess
potential interventions. We firstly established a dose-response relationship
between the risk of transmission to human and the amount of ingested viruses. We 
further estimated the incidence of HEV infection specifically attributed to
pork-related foodborne transmission in four representative European countries.
Finally, we demonstrated a proof-of-concept of mitigating HEV transmission by
implementing vaccination in human and pig populations. Our modeling approach
bears essential implications for better understanding the transmission of
pork-related foodborne HEV and for developing mitigation strategies.
