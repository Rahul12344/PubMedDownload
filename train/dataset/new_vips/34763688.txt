BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people's mental health worldwide. 
Patients with diabetes are at risk for a severe course of illness when infected
with SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to retrospectively examine mental health 
changes in patients with diabetes in Germany before and after the initial
COVID-19 outbreak, and to furthermore explore potential predictors of such
changes.
METHODS: Over the course of eight weeks from April to June 2020, 253 individuals 
diagnosed with diabetes participated in an online cross-sectional study.
Participants completed an anonymous survey including demographics, depression
(PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-2), distress (DT), and health
status (EQ-5D-3L). In addition, all instruments used were modified to
retrospectively ask participants to recall their mental health and health status 
before the outbreak had started. Additionally examined factors were
COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face the pandemic, and
the subjective level of information about COVID-19.
RESULTS: This study shows a significant increase in prevalence of depression
symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms and distress, as well as significantly
decreased health statuses in diabetes patients after the initial COVID-19
outbreak. Increased depression symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms and
distress were predicted by COVID-19-related fear, whereas trust in governmental
actions to face COVID-19 predicted higher depression symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a negative impact of the initial COVID-19
outbreak on mental health and health status in patients with diabetes. In order
to improve the efficacy of psychological support strategies for diabetes patients
during the pandemic, possible predictors of mental health impairment such as the 
aforementioned should be examined more thoroughly and addressed more openly.
