INTRODUCTION: This paper updates and summarizes the current evidence informing
rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19 and/or describing the consequences of
the disease and its treatment.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Studies published from May 1st to June 30th, 2021 were
selected, excluding descriptive studies and expert opinions. Papers were
categorized according to study design, research question, COVID-19 phase,
limitations of functioning of rehabilitation interest, and type of rehabilitation
service involved. From this edition, we improved the quality assessment using the
Joanna Briggs Institute checklists for observational studies and the Cochrane
Risk of Bias Tool for randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs).
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-five, out of 3699 papers, were included. They were
three RCTs, 13 cross-sectional studies and nine cohort studies. Twenty studies
reported data on symptom prevalence (N.=13) or disease natural history (N.=7);
and five studies reported intervention effectiveness at the individual level. All
study participants were COVID survivors and 48% of studies collected information 
on participants 6 months or longer after COVID-19 onset. The most frequent risks 
of bias for RCTs concerned weaknesses in allocation concealment, blinding of
therapists, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis. Most analytical studies
failed to identify or deal with confounders, describe or deal with dropouts or
eventually perform an appropriate statistical analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Most studies in this updated review targeted the prevalence of
limitations of functioning of rehabilitation interest in COVID-19 survivors. This
is similar to past review findings; however, data in the new studies was
collected at longer follow-up periods (up to one year after symptom onset) and in
larger samples of participants. More RCTs and analytical observational studies
are available, but the methodological quality of recently published studies is
low. There is a need for good quality intervention efficacy and effectiveness
studies to complement the rapidly expanding evidence from observational studies.
