As one of the main influenza antigens, neuraminidase (NA) in H3N2 virus has
evolved extensively for more than 50 years due to continuous immune pressure.
While NA has recently emerged as an effective vaccine target, biophysical
constraints on the antigenic evolution of NA remain largely elusive. Here, we
apply combinatorial mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing to characterize
the local fitness landscape in an antigenic region of NA in six different human
H3N2 strains that were isolated around 10 years apart. The local fitness
landscape correlates well among strains and the pairwise epistasis is highly
conserved. Our analysis further demonstrates that local net charge governs the
pairwise epistasis in this antigenic region. In addition, we show that residue
coevolution in this antigenic region is correlated with the pairwise epistasis
between charge states. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of
quantifying epistasis and the underlying biophysical constraint for building a
model of influenza evolution.
