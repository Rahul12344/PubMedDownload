Importance: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with fatigue and sleep
problems long after the acute phase of COVID-19. In addition, there are concerns 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection causing psychiatric illness; however, evidence of a
direct effect is inconclusive.
Objective: To assess risk of risk of incident or repeat psychiatric illness,
fatigue, or sleep problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection and to analyze changes 
according to demographic subgroups.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assembled matched cohorts
using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, a UK primary care registry
of 11 923 499 individuals aged 16 years or older. Patients were followed-up for
up to 10 months, from February 1 to December 9, 2020. Individuals with less than 
2 years of historical data or less than 1 week follow-up were excluded.
Individuals with positive results on a SARS-CoV-2 test without prior mental
illness or with anxiety or depression, psychosis, fatigue, or sleep problems were
matched with up to 4 controls based on sex, general practice, and year of birth. 
Controls were individuals who had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Data were
analyzed from January to July 2021.
Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined via polymerase chain reaction testing.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox proportional hazard models estimated the
association between a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and subsequent psychiatric 
morbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis, or self-harm), sleep problems,
fatigue, or psychotropic prescribing. Models adjusted for comorbidities,
ethnicity, smoking, and body mass index.
Results: Of 11 923 105 eligible individuals (6 011 020 [50.4%] women and
5 912 085 [49.6%] men; median [IQR] age, 44 [30-61] years), 232 780 individuals
(2.0%) had positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 test. After applying selection
criteria, 86 922 individuals were in the matched cohort without prior mental
illness, 19 020 individuals had prior anxiety or depression, 1036 individuals had
psychosis, 4152 individuals had fatigue, and 4539 individuals had sleep problems.
After adjusting for observed confounders, there was an association between
positive SARS-CoV-2 test results and psychiatric morbidity (adjusted hazard ratio
[aHR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.66-2.02), fatigue (aHR, 5.98; 95% CI, 5.33-6.71), and
sleep problems (aHR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.64-3.78). However, there was a similar risk 
of incident psychiatric morbidity for those with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test
results (aHR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.65-1.77) and a larger increase associated with
influenza (aHR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.55-5.75).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of individuals registered at an
English primary care practice during the pandemic, there was consistent evidence 
that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of fatigue and sleep
problems. However, the results from the negative control analysis suggest that
unobserved confounding may be responsible for at least some of the positive
association between COVID-19 and psychiatric morbidity.
