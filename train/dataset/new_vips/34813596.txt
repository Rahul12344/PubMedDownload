Abundant secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in the mucus, breast milk, and saliva 
provides immunity against infection of mucosal surfaces. Pre-pandemic breast milk
samples containing SIgA have been reported to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2;
however, it remains unknown whether SIgA showing the cross-reaction with
SARS-CoV-2 exists in saliva. We aimed to clarify whether SIgA in saliva
cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit in individuals who have not been
infected with this virus. The study involved 137 (men, n = 101; women, n = 36;
mean age, 38.7; age range, 24-65 years) dentists and doctors from Kanagawa Dental
University Hospital. Saliva and blood samples were analyzed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and immunochromatography for IgG and IgM, respectively. We then
identified patients with saliva samples that were confirmed to be PCR-negative
and IgM-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The cross-reactivity of IgA-positive saliva
samples with SARS-CoV-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using
a biotin-labeled spike recombinant protein (S1-mFc) covering the receptor-binding
domain of SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive
individuals was 46.7%, which correlated negatively with age (r = -0.218, p =
0.01). The proportion of IgA-positive individuals aged ≥50 years was
significantly lower than that of patients aged ≤49 years (p = 0.008). SIgA was
purified from the saliva of patients, which could partially suppress the binding 
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor. This
study demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive SIgA in the saliva
of individuals who had never been infected with the virus, suggesting that SIgA
may help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
