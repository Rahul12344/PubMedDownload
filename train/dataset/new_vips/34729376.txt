Targeting host factors for anti-viral development offers several potential
advantages over traditional countermeasures that include broad-spectrum activity 
and prevention of resistance. Characterization of host factors in animal models
provides strong evidence of their involvement in disease pathogenesis, but the
feasibility of performing high-throughput in vivo analyses on lists of genes is
problematic. To begin addressing the challenges of screening candidate host
factors in vivo, we combined advances in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing with an
immunocompromised mouse model used to study highly pathogenic viruses. Transgenic
mice harboring a constitutively expressed Cas9 allele (Cas9 tg/tg ) with or
without knockout of type I interferon receptors served to optimize in vivo
delivery of CRISPR single-guide RNA (sgRNA) using Invivofectamine 3.0, a simple
and easy-to-use lipid nanoparticle reagent. Invivofectamine 3.0-mediated
liver-specific editing to remove activity of the critical Ebola virus host factor
Niemann-Pick disease type C1 in an average of 74% of liver cells protected
immunocompromised Cas9 tg/tg mice from lethal surrogate Ebola virus infection. We
envision that immunocompromised Cas9 tg/tg mice combined with straightforward
sgRNA in vivo delivery will enable efficient host factor loss-of-function
screening in the liver and other organs to rapidly study their effects on viral
pathogenesis and help initiate development of broad-spectrum, host-directed
therapies against emerging pathogens.
