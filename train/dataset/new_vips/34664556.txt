The SARS-CoV-2 infection has become as a worldwide public health emergency. It
exhibits a variety of clinical presentations, ranging from benign to acute
respiratory distress syndrome, systemic involvement, and multiorganic failure.
The severity of the clinical picture depends on host and virus biological
features and the presence of comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease. In
addition, the interaction between the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and
the exacerbated immune response could lead to the development of acute kidney
injury. However, the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal cells, the
prognosis of patients with chronic kidney disease, and the long-term behavior of 
renal function are not entirely understood. This review aims to explore the role 
of SARS-CoV-2 in acute and chronic kidney disease and the possible pathogenic
mechanisms of renal involvement.
