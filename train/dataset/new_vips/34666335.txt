BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
currently the most important etiological agent of acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) with millions of infections and deaths in the last two years
worldwide. Several reasons and parameters are responsible for the difficult
management of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients; the first is virus
behavioral factors such as high transmission rate, and the different molecular
and cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis remain a matter of controversy, is
another factor.
SUMMARY: In the present review, we attempted to explain about features of
SARS-COV-2, particularly focusing on the various aspects of pathogenesis and
treatment strategies. Key Messages: We note evidence for the understanding of the
precise molecular and cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, which can
help design the appropriate drug or vaccine. Additionally, and importantly, we
reported the updated issues associated with the history and development of
treatment strategies such as, drugs, vaccines, and other medications that have
been approved or under consideration in clinics and markets worldwide.
