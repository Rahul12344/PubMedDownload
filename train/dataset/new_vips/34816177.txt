The new coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was first identified in late 2019 as the new RNA
virus in the coronaviridae family responsible for causing COVID-19 in the
residents of China's Hubei province. In mid-March 2020 WHO declared the pandemic 
caused by this virus as a result of thousands of people infected all over the
world. Epidemiological evidence obtained from other pandemics, such as influenza 
and ebola, suggest that pregnant women are more susceptible to serious
complications and death from viral infection. Physiological changes in the
anatomical structure of the respiratory system as well as in the immune system
during the pregnancy-puerperal period seem to contribute to this greater risk.
Thus, pregnant women are more susceptible to be infected by the SARS-COV-2 or
other viruses and to have serious COVID-19 disease. In fact, COVID-19 can alter
immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, affecting the well-being of
both mother and her fetus. There is still no sufficient evidence in the
literature to support the occurrence of vertical transmission and through
breastfeeding, but the prevalence of prematurity was high among pregnant women
infected by SARS-Cov-2. In this review, the changes in the immune system that may
increase susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 are discussed as well as the possible
mechanisms involved in the transmission of the virus to the fetus by vertical
transmission and during breastfeeding.
