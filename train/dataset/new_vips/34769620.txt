Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) contribute to patient morbidity and
mortality with an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths costing USD 
$28-34 billion annually in the United States alone. There is little understanding
as to if current environmental surface disinfection practices reduce pathogen
load, and subsequently HAIs, in critical care settings. This evidence map
includes a systematic review on the efficacy of disinfecting environmental
surfaces in healthcare facilities. We screened 17,064 abstracts, 635 full texts, 
and included 181 articles for data extraction and study quality assessment. We
reviewed ten disinfectant types and compared disinfectants with respect to study 
design, outcome organism, and fourteen indictors of study quality. We found
important areas for improvement and gaps in the research related to study design,
implementation, and analysis. Implementation of disinfection, a determinant of
disinfection outcomes, was not measured in most studies and few studies assessed 
fungi or viruses. Assessing and comparing disinfection efficacy was impeded by
study heterogeneity; however, we catalogued the outcomes and results for each
disinfection type. We concluded that guidelines for disinfectant use are
primarily based on laboratory data rather than a systematic review of in situ
disinfection efficacy. It is critically important for practitioners and
researchers to consider system-level efficacy and not just the efficacy of the
disinfectant.
