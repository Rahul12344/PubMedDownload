Pesticides and pathogens are known drivers of declines in global entomofauna.
However, interactions between pesticides and viruses, which could range from
antagonistic, over additive to synergistic, are poorly understood in ants. Here, 
we show that in ants the impact of single and combined pesticide and virus
stressors can vary across castes and at the colony level. A fully-crossed
laboratory assay was used to evaluate interactions between a sublethal dose of
the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) in black
garden ants, Lasius niger. After monitoring colonies over 64 weeks, body mass,
neonicotinoid residues and virus titres of workers and queens, as well as worker 
behavioural activity were measured. ABPV, but not thiamethoxam, reduced activity 
of workers. Neonicotinoid exposure resulted in reduced body mass of workers, but 
not of queens. Further, thiamethoxam facilitated ABPV infections in queens, but
not in workers. Overall, virus exposure did not compromise detoxification and
body mass, but one colony showed high virus titres and worker mortality. Although
the data suggest additive effects at the level of individuals and castes,
co-exposure with both stressors elicited antagonistic effects on colony size. Our
results create demand for long-term holistic risk assessment of individual
stressors and their interactions to protect biodiversity.
