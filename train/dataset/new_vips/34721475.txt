Herbivorous insects, likewise, other organisms, are exposed to diverse
communities of microbes from the surrounding environment. Insects and
microorganisms associated with them share a range of relationships, including
symbiotic and pathogenic. Insects damage plants by feeding on them and delivering
plant pathogens to wounded places, from where pathogens spread over the plant.
Thus insects can be considered as both pests and reservoirs or vectors of plant
pathogens. Although beetles are not mentioned in the first place as plant
pathogen vectors, their transmission of pathogens also takes place and affects
the ecosystem. Here we present an overview of beetles as vectors of plant
pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and Oomycota, which are
responsible for developing plant diseases that can have a significant impact on
crop yield and quality.
