A number of neurological complications have been reported after the
administration of flu vaccine, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),
especially after vaccination against swine flu. Only facial nerve neuropathy has 
thus far been reported after vaccination against COVID-19. More recently, there
was a case of an elderly woman with GBS. In our report, we describe a case of a
42-year-old, previously almost healthy male who developed sensory symptoms 14
days after the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. One week later, the patient
developed right facial nerve palsy and lower limb weakness and was no longer able
to walk. Albuminocytological dissociation was detected in the cerebrospinal
fluid, and there were inflammatory radicular changes in MRI scans of the
lumbosacral spine. EMG indicated significant demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis
and no antibodies against gangliosides were demonstrated. A 5-day course of
immunoglobulins at a dose of 2 g/kg lead to a significant improvement and the
patient was soon able to walk. In conclusion, we report a case of Guillan-Barré
syndrome after COVID-19 vaccine in a young patient with a rapid diagnosis and
prompt administration of immunoglobulins.
