More than one year since Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak,
the gold standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) detection is still the RT-qPCR. This is a limitation to increase
testing capacities, particularly at developing countries, as expensive reagents
and equipment are required. We developed a two steps end point RT-PCR reaction
with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) gene and Ribonuclease P (RNase P) specific
primers where viral amplicons were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. We
carried out a clinical performance and analytical sensitivity evaluation for this
two-steps end point RT-PCR method with 242 nasopharyngeal samples using the CDC
RT-qPCR protocol as a gold standard technique. With a specificity of 95.8%, a
sensitivity of 95.1%, and a limit of detection of 20 viral RNA copies/uL, this
two steps end point RT-PCR assay is an affordable and reliable method for
SARS-CoV-2 detection. This protocol would allow to extend COVID-19 diagnosis to
basic molecular biology laboratories with a potential positive impact
in surveillance programs at developing countries.
