A miniature fluorescence microscope (miniscope) is a potent tool for in vivo
calcium imaging from freely behaving animals. It offers several advantages over
conventional multi-photon calcium imaging systems: (1) compact; (2)
light-weighted; (3) affordable; and (4) allows recording from freely behaving
animals. This protocol describes brain surgeries for deep brain in vivo calcium
imaging using a custom-developed miniscope recording system. The preparation
procedure consists of three steps, including (1) stereotaxically injecting the
virus at the desired brain region of a mouse brain to label a specific subgroup
of neurons with genetically encoded calcium sensor; (2) implantation of
gradient-index (GRIN) lens that can relay calcium image from deep brain region to
the miniscope system; and (3) affixing the miniscope holder over the mouse skull 
where miniscope can be attached later. To perform in vivo calcium imaging, the
miniscope is fastened onto the holder, and neuronal calcium images are collected 
along with simultaneous behavior recordings. The present surgery protocol is
compatible with any commercial or custom-built single-photon and two-photon
imaging systems for deep brain in vivo calcium imaging.
