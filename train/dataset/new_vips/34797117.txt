This short report describes the role that family physicians (FPs) (and family
medicine registrars) played to provide care for the homeless people in shelters
(both temporary and permanent) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
lockdown in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. The lockdown resulted in the
establishment of a large number of temporary shelters. The FPs took on the task
to provide comprehensive and coordinated primary care, whilst extending their
activities in terms of data management, quality improvement, capacity building
and research. The FPs worked in teams with other healthcare providers and
contributed a unique set of skills to the process. This report demonstrates the
value of responding quickly and appropriately through communication, cooperation 
and innovation. It also demonstrates the large number of areas in which FPs can
make a difference when engaged appropriately, with the necessary support and
collaboration, thus making a positive impact in the already overburdened health
services.
