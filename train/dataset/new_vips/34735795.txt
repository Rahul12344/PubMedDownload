Extension of the interval between vaccine doses for the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was
introduced in the United Kingdom to accelerate population coverage with a single 
dose. At this time, trial data were lacking, and we addressed this in a study of 
United Kingdom healthcare workers. The first vaccine dose induced protection from
infection from the circulating alpha (B.1.1.7) variant over several weeks. In a
substudy of 589 individuals, we show that this single dose induces severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibody (NAb)
responses and a sustained B and T cell response to the spike protein. NAb levels 
were higher after the extended dosing interval (6-14 weeks) compared with the
conventional 3- to 4-week regimen, accompanied by enrichment of CD4+ T cells
expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2). Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection amplified and
accelerated the response. These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses
indicate that extension of the dosing interval is an effective immunogenic
protocol.
