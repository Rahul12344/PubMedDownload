In recent decades, Pakistan has suffered a decline in cotton production due to
several factors, including insect pests, cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD), and
multiple abiotic stresses. CLCuD is a highly damaging plant disease that
seriously limits cotton production in Pakistan. Recently, genome editing through 
CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized plant biology, especially to develop immunity in
plants against viral diseases. Here we demonstrate multiplex CRISPR/Cas-mediated 
genome editing against CLCuD using transient transformation in N. benthamiana
plants and cotton seedlings. The genomic sequences of cotton leaf curl viruses
(CLCuVs) were obtained from NCBI and the guide RNA (gRNA) were designed to target
three regions in the viral genome using CRISPR MultiTargeter. The gRNAs were
cloned in pHSE401/pKSE401 containing Cas9 and confirmed through colony PCR,
restriction analysis, and sequencing. Confirmed constructs were moved into
Agrobacterium and subsequently used for transformation. Agroinfilteration in N.
benthamiana revealed delayed symptoms (3-5 days) with improved resistance against
CLCuD. In addition, viral titer was also low (20-40%) in infected plants
co-infiltrated with Cas9-gRNA, compared to control plants (infected with virus
only). Similar results were obtained in cotton seedlings. The results of
transient expression in N. benthamiana and cotton seedlings demonstrate the
potential of multiplex CRISPR/Cas to develop resistance against CLCuD. Five
transgenic plants developed from three experiments showed resistance (60-70%) to 
CLCuV, out of which two were selected best during evaluation and screening. The
technology will help breeding CLCuD-resistant cotton varieties for sustainable
cotton production.
