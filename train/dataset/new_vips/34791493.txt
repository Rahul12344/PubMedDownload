BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to show that human T-cell lymphotropic virus
type 2 (HTLV-2) infection produces symptoms resembling those described for
HTLV-1-associated myeloneuropathy and to highlight the role of sexual
transmission in the silent dissemination of HTLV-2.
METHODS: Patient samples were tested by particle agglutination and indirect
immunofluorescence assay. The HTLV type was defined by molecular techniques.
Nucleotide sequence analysis of HTLV-2 long terminal repeat region, T cell
CD3/CD4 and T cell CD3/CD8 counts and typing of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)
alleles A, B, C and DRB1 were also performed.
RESULTS: HTLV-2 subtype b infection was confirmed in two blood donors and their
sexual partners. Two patients exhibited distinctive signs and symptoms of
progressive neurological disease. Three infected patients carried HLA-C*04. Both 
patients with neurological disease also carried HLA-A*31 and HLA-DRB1*07 alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein we describe for the first time sexual transmission of HTLV-2 
in a non-endemic region of Argentina, highlighting the relevance of this
transmission route in HTLV-2 silent dissemination out of the clusters of
endemicity. We also provide evidence that HTLV-2 infection causes symptoms
resembling those described for HTLV-1-associated myeloneuropathy. The evidence
presented herein points to the critical need for public health strategies to
reduce the spread of this neglected infection.
