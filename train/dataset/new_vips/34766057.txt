COVID-19 is a highly contagious and widespread disease that has strained the
global healthcare system to the hilt. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are well known
for their potent antimicrobial, antiviral, immunomodulatory and biosensing
properties. AgNPs have been found to be potential antiviral agent that act
against many deadly viruses and is presumed to be effective against COVID-19.
AgNPs can generate free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to
apoptosis mediated cell death thereby inhibiting viral infection. The shape and
size of AgNPs play an important role in its biomedical applications as
alterations may result in variable biological interaction and activity. Herein,
we propose that AgNPs can be utilized for effective management of the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the current status of AgNPs in the fight
against COVID-19.
