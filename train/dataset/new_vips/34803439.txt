Various recently reported mutant variants, candidate and urgently approved
current vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), many current situations with severe neurological damage and
symptoms as well as respiratory tract disorders have begun to be reported. In
particular, drug, vaccine, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have
been developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Here, we
review lessons learned from the use of novel mutant variants of the COVID-19
virus, immunization, new drug solutions, and antibody therapies for infections.
Next, we focus on the B 1.1.7, B 1.351, P.1, and B.1.617 lineages or variants of 
concern that have been reported worldwide, the new manifestations of neurological
manifestations, the current therapeutic drug targets for its treatment, vaccine
candidates and their efficacy, implantation of convalescent plasma, and
neutralization of mAbs. We review specific clinical questions, including many
emerging neurological effects and respiratory tract injuries, as well as new
potential biomarkers, new studies in addition to known therapeutics, and chronic 
diseases of vaccines that have received immediate approval. To answer these
questions, further understanding of the burden kinetics of COVID-19 and its
correlation with neurological clinical outcomes, endogenous antibody responses to
vaccines, pharmacokinetics of neutralizing mAbs, and action against emerging
viral mutant variants is needed.
