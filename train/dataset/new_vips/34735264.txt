This study aims to determine whether previous exposure to a total prison smoking 
ban is associated with a reduction in daily smoking postrelease and to identify
the factors associated with daily tobacco use. Demographics, incarceration
history, and substance use data were collected from the 2016 National Prisoner
Entrants' Blood Borne Virus Survey for 389 Australian prison entrants. Predictors
of daily smoking among those exposed to a smoking ban were illicit drug use and
Indigenous status. No significant association was found between current daily
smoking and recent exposure to a prison smoking ban, suggesting that the majority
of Australian prisoners exposed to a tobacco ban while incarcerated will return
to smoking once released. Complementary and culturally specific interventions
supporting abstinence postrelease should be considered.
