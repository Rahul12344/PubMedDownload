BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with a reduced risk
of developing dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Given that the
gut microbiota plays a significant role in cholesterol metabolism, we compared
the differences in gut microbial diversity and composition between HBV-infected
and uninfected subjects.
RESULTS: A prospective case-control study was designed comprising healthy
controls (group A) and HBV-infected individuals (group B) in a 1:1 ratio (57
participants each; total = 114). The patients in group B were divided into two
subgroups according to their HBV DNA loads: B1 < 2000 IU/mL (N = 40) and
B2 ≥ 2000 IU/mL (N = 17). In a pairwise comparison of HBV-infected individuals
and controls, higher alpha diversity was noted in group B, and the difference was
significant only in patients in group B1. Alloprevotella and Eubacterium
coprostanoligenes were predominant in group B1 compared to the control, whereas
the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella 2 was lower.
CONCLUSIONS: The gut microbiome in HBV-infected individuals with a low viral load
is highly diverse and is dominated by specific taxa involved in fatty acid and
lipid metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a
correlation between the presence of certain bacterial taxa and chronic HBV
infection depending on the load of HBV DNA.
