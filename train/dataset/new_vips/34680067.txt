OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies link hyperlipidemia with increased risk for
abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, the influence of lipid-lowering drugs
statins on prevalence and progression of clinical and experimental AAAs varies
between reports, engendering controversy on the association of hyperlipidemia
with AAA disease. This study investigated the impact of hypercholesterolemia on
elastase-induced experimental AAAs in mice.
METHODS: Both spontaneous (targeted deletion of apolipoprotein E) and induced
mouse hypercholesterolemia models were employed. In male wild type (WT) C57BL/6J 
mice, hypercholesterolemia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of an
adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a gain-of-function proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 mutation (PCSK9) followed by the administration of a
high-fat diet (HFD) (PCSK9+HFD) for two weeks. As normocholesterolemic controls
for PCSK9+HFD mice, WT mice were infected with PCSK9 AAV and fed normal chow, or 
injected with phosphate-buffered saline alone and fed HFD chow. AAAs were induced
in all mice by intra-aortic infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase and assessed 
by ultrasonography and histopathology.
RESULTS: In spontaneous hyper- and normo-cholesterolemic male mice, the aortic
diameter enlarged at a constant rate from day 3 through day 14 following elastase
infusion. AAAs, defined as a more than 50% diameter increase over baseline
measurements, formed in all mice. AAA progression was more pronounced in male
mice, with or without spontaneous hyperlipidemia. The extent of elastin
degradation and smooth muscle cell depletion were similar in spontaneous hyper-
(score 3.5 for elastin and 4.0 for smooth muscle) and normo- (both scores 4.0)
cholesterolemic male mice. Aortic mural macrophage accumulation was also
equivalent between the two groups. No differences were observed in aortic
accumulation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, B cells, or mural angiogenesis between male
spontaneous hyper- and normocholesterolemic mice. Similarly, no influence of
spontaneous hypercholesterolemia on characteristic aneurysmal histopathology was 
noted in female mice. In confirmatory experiments, induced hypercholesterolemia
also exerted no appreciable effect on AAA progression and histopathologies.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no recognizable impact of
hypercholesterolemia on elastase-induced experimental AAA progression in both
spontaneous and induced hypercholesterolemia mouse models. These results add
further uncertainty to the controversy surrounding the efficacy of statin therapy
in clinical AAA disease.
