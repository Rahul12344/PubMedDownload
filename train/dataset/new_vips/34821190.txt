INTRODUCTION: Endoscopists are at high risk of exposure and nosocomial
transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2
virus) when performing endoscopic procedures due to the highly aerosol generating
nature of these procedures. At present there is still no consensus among
endoscopists with regards to the type of protective equipment to be worn by
healthcare workers, when performing endoscopy during the coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic.
AREAS COVERED: This review encompasses a summary of currently published
guidelines related to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when
performing endoscopic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
EXPERT OPINION: With increasing calls to rationalize the use of PPE due to
shortages in global supply chains, the review offers a concise summary on the
most appropriate and adequate use of PPE when performing endoscopy during the
pandemic. It is expected that these adaptations in the use of PPE during the
pandemic, will help to improve standards of care and safety of healthcare
workers.
