Several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are strongly associated with
susceptibility to classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), also in subgroups stratified
for presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We tested the hypothesis that the
pressure on cHL tumour cells to lose HLA expression is associated with HLA
susceptibility alleles. A meta-analysis was carried out to identify consistent
protective and risk HLA alleles in a combined cohort of 839 cHL patients from the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Tumour cell HLA expression was studied in 338
cHL cases from these two cohorts and correlated to the presence of specific
susceptibility HLA alleles. Carriers of the HLA-DRB1*07 protective allele
frequently lost HLA class II expression in cHL overall. Patients carrying the
HLA-DRB1*15/16 (DR2) risk allele retained HLA class II expression in EBV- cHL and
patients with the HLA-B*37 risk allele retained HLA class I expression more
frequently than non-carriers in EBV+ cHL. The other susceptibility alleles showed
no significant differences in expression. Thus, HLA expression by tumour cells is
associated with a subset of the protective and risk alleles. This strongly
suggests that HLA associations in cHL are related to peptide binding capacities
of specific HLA alleles.
