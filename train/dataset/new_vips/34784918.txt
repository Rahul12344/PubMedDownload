INTRODUCTION: Programmes that merge management of Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) aim to improve HIV/TB co-infected patients' access to
comprehensive treatment. However, several reports from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
indicate suboptimal uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) even after integration
of HIV and TB treatment. This study assessed ART uptake, its barriers and
enablers in programmes integrating TB and HIV treatment in SSA.
METHOD: A systematic review was performed. Seven databases were searched for
eligible quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies published from March
2004 through July 2019. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled
estimates of ART uptake. A thematic approach was used to analyse and synthesise
data on barriers and enablers.
RESULTS: Of 5139 references identified, 27 were included in the review: 23/27
estimated ART uptake and 10/27 assessed barriers to and/or enablers of ART
uptake. The pooled ART uptake was 53% (95% CI: 42, 63%) and between-study
heterogeneity was high (I2 = 99.71%, p < 0.001). WHO guideline on collaborative
TB/HIV activities and sample size were associated with heterogeneity. There were 
statistically significant subgroup effects with high heterogeneity after subgroup
analyses by region, guideline on collaborative TB/HIV activities, study design,
and sample size. The most frequently described socioeconomic and individual level
barriers to ART uptake were stigma, low income, and younger age group. The most
frequently reported health system-related barriers were limited staff capacity,
shortages in medical supplies, lack of infrastructure, and poor adherence to or
lack of treatment guidelines. Clinical barriers included intolerance to anti-TB
drugs, fear of drug toxicity, and contraindications to antiretrovirals. Health
system enablers included good management of the procurement, supply, and
dispensation chain; convenience and accessibility of treatment services; and
strong staff capacity. Availability of psychosocial support was the most
frequently reported enabler of uptake at the community level.
CONCLUSIONS: In SSA, programmes integrating treatment of TB and HIV do not, in
general, achieve high ART uptake but we observe a net improvement in uptake after
WHO issued the 2012 guidelines on collaborative TB/HIV activities. The recurrence
of specific modifiable system-level and patient-level factors in the literature
reveals key intervention points to improve ART uptake in these programmes.
