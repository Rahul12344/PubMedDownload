Recent years have witnessed the emergence of several viral diseases, including
various zoonotic diseases such as the current pandemic caused by the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Other viruses, which possess
pandemic-causing potential include avian flu, Ebola, dengue, Zika, and Nipah
virus, as well as the re-emergence of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronaviruses. Notably, effective
drugs or vaccines against these viruses are still to be discovered. All the newly
approved vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2-induced disease COVID-19 possess
real-time possibility of becoming obsolete because of the development of
'variants of concern'. Flavonoids are being increasingly recognized as
prophylactic and therapeutic agents against emerging and old viral diseases.
Around 10,000 natural flavonoid compounds have been identified, being
phytochemicals, all plant-based. Flavonoids have been reported to have lesser
side effects than conventional anti-viral agents and are effective against more
viral diseases than currently used anti-virals. Despite their abundance in
plants, which are a part of human diet, flavonoids have the problem of low
bioavailability. Various attempts are in progress to increase the bioavailability
of flavonoids, one of the promising fields being nanotechnology. This review is a
narrative of some anti-viral dietary flavonoids, their bioavailability, and
various means with an emphasis on the nanotechnology system(s) being experimented
with to deliver anti-viral flavonoids, whose systems show potential in the
efficient delivery of flavonoids, resulting in increased bioavailability.
