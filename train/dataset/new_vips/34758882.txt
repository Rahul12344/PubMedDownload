OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of A. baumannii in
children aged less than 1 year admitted with a clinical diagnosis of whooping
cough.
RESULTS: A total of 225 nasopharyngeal samples from children under 1 year old
hospitalized with clinical diagnosis of whooping cough were studied from January 
2010 to July 2012. The presence of A. baumannii was detected in 20.89% (47/225)
of the nasopharyngeal swab samples. Among the 47 patients with A. baumannii: 5
were diagnosed with A. baumannii monoinfection, 17 co-infection with bacteria, 7 
co-infection with virus and 18 co-infection with bacteria + virus. It was
observed that 51.6% (116/225) were children between 29 days and 3 months old,
this same group had the highest overall prevalence with 53.3%. The most common
co-infecting pathogens were Bordetella pertussis in 55.3%, Adenovirus in 42.6%
and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 23.4%.
