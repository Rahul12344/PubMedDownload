We describe an unvaccinated child at risk for life-threatening COVID-19 due to an
inherited deficiency of IRF9, which governs ISGF-3-dependent responses to type I 
and III interferons (IFN). She was admitted, with a high nasal SARS-CoV-2 load on
day 1 of upper respiratory tract infection. She was viremic on day 2 and received
casirivimab and imdevimab. Her clinical manifestations and viremia disappeared on
days 3 and 4, respectively. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus induced the expression
of IFN-stimulated genes in leukocytes on day 1, whereas the secretion of blood
type I IFNs, which peaked on day 4, did not. Antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2
neutralization is, therefore, sufficient to overcome a deficiency of antiviral
IFNs.
