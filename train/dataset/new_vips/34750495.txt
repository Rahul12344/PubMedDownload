Hypercoagulability and the need for prioritizing coagulation markers for
prognostic abilities have been highlighted in COVID-19. We aimed to quantify the 
associations of D-dimer with disease progression in patients with COVID-19. This 
systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO,
CRD42020186661.We included 113 studies in our systematic review, of which 100
records (n = 38,310) with D-dimer data) were considered for meta-analysis. Across
68 unadjusted (n = 26,960) and 39 adjusted studies (n = 15,653) reporting initial
D-dimer, a significant association was found in patients with higher D-dimer for 
the risk of overall disease progression (unadjusted odds ratio (uOR) 3.15;
adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.64). The time-to-event outcomes were pooled across 19
unadjusted (n = 9743) and 21 adjusted studies (n = 13,287); a strong association 
was found in patients with higher D-dimers for the risk of overall disease
progression (unadjusted hazard ratio (uHR) 1.41; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)
1.10). The prognostic use of higher D-dimer was found to be promising for
predicting overall disease progression (studies 68, area under curve 0.75) in
COVID-19. Our study showed that higher D-dimer levels provide prognostic
information useful for clinicians to early assess COVID-19 patients at risk for
disease progression and mortality outcomes. This study, recommends rapid
assessment of D-dimer for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19.
