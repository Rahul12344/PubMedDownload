Leishmania spp. are important pathogens causing a vector-borne disease with a
broad range of clinical manifestations from self-healing ulcers to the
life-threatening visceral forms. Presence of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) confers
survival advantage to these parasites by suppressing anti-leishmanial immunity in
the vertebrate host. The two viral species, LRV1 and LRV2 infect species of the
subgenera Viannia and Leishmania, respectively. In this work we investigated
co-phylogenetic patterns of leishmaniae and their viruses on a small scale (LRV2 
in L. major) and demonstrated their predominant coevolution, occasionally broken 
by intraspecific host switches. Our analysis of the two viral genes, encoding the
capsid and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), revealed them to be under the
pressure of purifying selection, which was considerably stronger for the former
gene across the whole tree. The selective pressure also differs between the LRV
clades and correlates with the frequency of interspecific host switches. In
addition, using experimental (capsid) and predicted (RDRP) models we demonstrated
that the evolutionary variability across the structure is strikingly different in
these two viral proteins.
