telehealth and on pet owners' attitudes toward cats and dogs.

OBJECTIVE: To gather and evaluate veterinarians' perspectives about the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of veterinary telehealth and on cat owners'
versus dog owners' attitudes toward transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from
their pets.
SAMPLE: 93 respondent veterinarians (47 in primary care practice and 46 in
specialty practice).
PROCEDURES: An online survey was conducted between June 15 and July 15, 2020, and
included 21 questions concerning demographics, use of telehealth before and after
the onset of the pandemic (before March 15, 2020, and between March 15 and June
15, 2020, respectively), changes in caseloads, and perception of clients'
concerns about potential for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from pets.
Reported zip codes informed the collection of census data.
RESULTS: The level of poverty was significantly lower in zip code areas for
respondents who reported telehealth services were (vs were not) offered before
the pandemic. The percentage of respondents who reported their practice offered
telehealth services increased from 12% (11/93) before the pandemic to 38% (35/93)
between March 15 and June 15, 2020. Although most respondents reported
owner-expressed concerns over SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission from their pets, most
also reported increased caseloads, seeing newly adopted pets, and few discussions
of surrender of pets for reasons related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings indicated that caseloads increased
and telehealth services expanded during the pandemic but that there was no
evidence of differences in respondent-reported owner concern for SARS-CoV-2 virus
transmission from cats versus dogs.
