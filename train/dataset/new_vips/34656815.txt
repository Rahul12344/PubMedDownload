OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 continues to cause devastation throughout the world. Various
factors influence the perioperative course and prognosis of COVID-19. This study 
aims to collate the independent prognostic factors among hospitalised COVID-19
patients in east Iran.
STUDY DESIGN: In this cohort study, all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19 between 19 February 2020 and 1 August 2020 who were admitted to nine
public hospitals of South Khorasan province, Iran, were enrolled.
METHODS: Univariate analysis (chi-square [χ2], and Mann-Whitney U test) and
multiple logistic regression were performed.
RESULTS: This study included 1290 participants; 676 patients (52.4%) were male. A
total of 1189 (92.2%) recovered, and 101 (7.8%) died. The results show that
in-hospital mortality increases with advanced age (the optimal cut-off point = 62
years). The following three variables were shown to have the most significant
role in in-hospital mortality: age >60 years (odds ratio [OR] = 8.01, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 4.8-13.35), shortness of breath (OR = 2.65, 95% CI:
1.4-69.17) and atypical radiological manifestations in a chest X-ray on admission
(OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.3-28.64). In the univariate analysis, associated
comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, influenced the in-hospital
mortality rate, while the same could not be replicated in the multiple variable
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the potential predictors of COVID-19 and
highlighted the need to be cautious with advanced age and heightened clinical
symptoms at the time of admission.
