ABSTRACT: The corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, had health and
economic results that profoundly affected communities worldwide. Investigating
the seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in blood donors is of a significant clinical and
scientific value as it adds to knowledge about local herd immunity levels.To
study the prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 infection among blood donors at a tertiary
referral hospital in the north of Jordan.This is a prospective study that
included all blood donors between September 2020 and March 2021. Donors' IgG
antibodies were qualitatively immunoassayed to determine the antibody status
against SARS-CoV-2. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 technique was utilized.One
thousand samples were tested by total antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The median age
was 29 years, 96.7% were males. The seroprevalence was 14.5%, and 80% of the
positive participants did not report previous COVID-19 infection. The
seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies was less among smokers and those with an O 
blood group and higher among donors with an AB blood group.The prevalence of
COVID-19 among healthy young blood donors at a tertiary teaching health facility 
in the north of Jordan was 14.5%. Smokers and those with an O blood group were
less likely to be seropositive, as opposed to donors with an AB blood group.
