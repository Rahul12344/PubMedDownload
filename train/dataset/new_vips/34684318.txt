The body of knowledge on alcohol use and communicable diseases has been growing
in recent years. Using a narrative review approach, this paper discusses
alcohol's role in the acquisition of and treatment outcomes from four different
communicable diseases: these include three conditions included in comparative
risk assessments to date-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/AIDS, tuberculosis
(TB), and lower respiratory infections/pneumonia-as well as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of its recent and rapid
ascension as a global health concern. Alcohol-attributable TB, HIV, and pneumonia
combined were responsible for approximately 360,000 deaths and 13 million
disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs) in 2016, with alcohol-attributable TB
deaths and DALYs predominating. There is strong evidence that alcohol is
associated with increased incidence of and poorer treatment outcomes from HIV,
TB, and pneumonia, via both behavioral and biological mechanisms. Preliminary
studies suggest that heavy drinkers and those with alcohol use disorders are at
increased risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness. Aside from HIV research,
limited research exists that can guide interventions for addressing
alcohol-attributable TB and pneumonia or COVID-19. Implementation of effective
individual-level interventions and alcohol control policies as a means of
reducing the burden of communicable diseases is recommended.
