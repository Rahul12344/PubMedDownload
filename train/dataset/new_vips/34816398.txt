Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) have gained a great attention to be developed as
vaccine vectors against human and veterinary pathogens. Avirulent APMVs are
highly safe to be used as vaccine vectors for avian and non-avian species. APMV
vectored vaccines induce robust cellular and humoral immune responses in a broad 
range of hosts. APMV vectors can be a good platform by facilitating rapid
generation of vaccines against emerging pathogens. In this chapter, we discuss
application of reverse genetics of APMVs for vaccine development, design of APMV 
vectored vaccines, cloning of protective antigen(s) into a vector, recovery of
vectored vaccines and characterization of generated vaccine viruses.
