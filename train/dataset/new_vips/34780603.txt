We investigated causes of antler deformities in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)
bucks from the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah, US. A total of 10
hunter-harvested and nine live-captured bucks with antler deformities and six
hunter-harvested and 43 live-captured bucks with normal antlers were included in 
the study. All were screened by serology for exposure to epizootic hemorrhagic
disease virus (EHDV) types 1, 2, and 6, bluetongue virus, Brucella abortus,
Brucella ovis, caprine arthritis, encephalitis virus, and bovine viral diarrhea
virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2. Serum testosterone and trace minerals concentrations 
were measured, and whole-blood counts evaluated. Testicular tissue from the
hunter-harvested bucks was tested by quantitative PCR for EHDV-1, -2, and -6. All
bucks with antler deformities had low to nondetectable serum testosterone
concentrations from end-stage fibrosing orchitis, and EHDV-2 was detected by
quantitative PCR in one of the testicular tissues tested. All bucks with antler
deformities were seropositive for EHDV-2. In comparison, only 53% of bucks with
normal antlers were EHDV-2 seropositive. More than 67% of hunter-harvested and
live-captured bucks had antibodies to BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, probably because of high
cattle exposure in the area. Our results support previous research linking
infection with EHDV-2 to development of antler deformities; however, it remains
unclear why some infected bucks develop testicular fibrosis, and others recover
from the infection.
