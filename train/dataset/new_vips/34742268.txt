BACKGROUND: Prevention and control (P&C) of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
is still a critical task in most countries and regions. However, there are many
single evaluation indexes to assess the quality of COVID-19 P&C. It is necessary 
to synthesize the single evaluation indexes reasonably to obtain the overall
evaluation results.
METHODS: This study was divided into three steps. Step 1: In February 2020, the
improved Delphi method was used to establish the quality evaluation indexes
system for COVID-19 P&C. Step 2: in March 2020, the CRITIC method was used to
adjust the Order Relation Analysis (G1) method to obtain the subjective and
objective (S&O) combination weights. The comprehensive evaluation value was
obtained using the weighted Efficacy Coefficient (EC) method, weighted TOPSIS
method, weighted rank-sum ratio (RSR) method, and weighted Grey Relationship
Analysis (GRA) method. Finally, the linear normalization method was used to
synthesize the evaluation values of different evaluation methods. Step 3: From
April 2020 to May 2021, this evaluation method was used to monitor and assess
COVID-19 P&C quality in critical departments prospectively. The results were
reported to the departments monthly.
RESULT: A quality evaluation indexes system for COVID-19 P&C was established.
Kendall's consistency test shows that the four evaluation method had good
consistency (χ2 = 43.429, P<0.001, Kendall's consistency coefficient = 0.835).
The Spearman correlation test showed that the correlation between the combined
evaluation results and the original method was statistically
significant(P < 0.001). According to the Mann-Kendall test, from March 2020 to
May 2021, the mean value of COVID-19 P&C quality in all critical departments
showed an upward trend (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The combined comprehensive evaluation method based on the S&O
combined weight was more scientific and comprehensive than the single weighting
and evaluation methods. In addition, monitoring and feedback of COVID-19 P&C
quality were helpful for the improvement of P&C quality.
