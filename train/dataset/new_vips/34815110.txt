Thrombopoietin regulates platelet production through activation of the
thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R). TPO-R agonists (TPO-RAs) are available to treat 
thrombocytopenia in chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), chronic liver disease 
(CLD) patients who are undergoing a procedure, severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. There are four TPO-RAs approved in the US and 
Europe: romiplostim (ITP), eltrombopag (ITP, SAA, HCV), avatrombopag (ITP, CLD), 
and lusutrombopag (CLD). It is important to understand pharmacological
characteristics of these agents when evaluating treatment options. Avatrombopag
interacts with the transmembrane domain of the TPO-RA and does not compete with
endogenous thrombopoietin for TPO-R binding. Structural differences between
avatrombopag and other TPO-RAs may impart differential downstream effects on cell
signaling pathways, potentially resulting in clinically relevant differences in
outcome. Avatrombopag has a favorable pharmacological profile with similar
exposure in Japanese, Chinese, or Caucasian patients and no drug-drug
interactions, food interactions, or potential for chelation.
