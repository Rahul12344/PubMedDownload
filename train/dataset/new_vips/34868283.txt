Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major worldwide health problem
that can cause liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The clinical
treatment of HCV infection mainly relies on the use of direct-acting antivirals
(DAAs) that are usually expensive and have side effects. Therefore, achieving the
discovery of more successful agents is always urgent. In this context, antiviral 
compounds that inhibit viral infections and disease progression with important
therapeutic activities have been identified in animal venoms including arthropod 
toxins. This indicates that arthropod venoms represent a good natural source of
promising candidates for new antivirals.
Methods: The antiviral activity of the wasp venom (WV), isolated from the
Oriental hornet (Vespa orientalis), was assessed using cell culture technique
with human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line (Huh7it-1) and the
recombinant strain of HCV genotype 2a (JFH1).
Results: The results revealed that WV inhibited HCV infectivity with 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10 ng/mL, while the 50% cytotoxic
concentration (CC50) was 11,000 ng/mL. Time of addition experiment showed that
the WV blocked HCV attachment/entry to the cells probably through virucidal
effect. On the other hand, the venom showed no inhibitory effect on HCV
replication.
Conclusion: WV can inhibit the entry stage of HCV infection at non-cytotoxic
concentrations. Therefore, it could be considered a potential candidate for
characterization of natural anti-HCV agents targeting the entry step.
