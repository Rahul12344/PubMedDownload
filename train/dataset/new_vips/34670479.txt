The present study aimed to prepare a kind of controlled-releasing insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/spider silk protein nanofibrous membrane using a
electrostatic spinning method and evaluated its effect on the cell viability of
endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Recombinant spidroin named as GMCDRSSP-IgF-1
was electro-spun into nanofibrous membrane which can be degraded by protease and 
be capable of sustained-release of IGF-1. The membrane can be degraded after
being treated with thrombin. The release assay results showed that IGF-1
concentration could be maintained at 20Â ng/ml for a long time with treatment of
Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. The viability of EPCs on GMCDRSSP-IgF-1
nanofibrous membrane was significantly increased with the presence of TEV
protease. The controlled and sustained release of IGF-1 from the nanofibrous
membrane could promote the adhesion and viability of EPCs. In summary, the
nanofibrous membrane that exhibits controlled degradation and sustained release
of IGF-1 was prepared with electrostatic spinning from genetically modified
recombinant spider silk protein. The nanofibrous membrane exhibited good blood
compatibility and cytocompatibility. With the presence of TEV protease, the
sustained-release of IGF-1 significantly promoted the adhesion and viability of
EPCs. The new nanofibrous membrane can be potentially used as a scaffold for EPCs
culture in vitro and future in vivo studies.
