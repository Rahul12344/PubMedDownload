Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus carried by âˆ¼80% of the world's
population. Acute infections are asymptomatic in healthy individuals but generate
diverse syndromes in neonates, solid organ transplant recipients, and
HIV-infected individuals. The HCMV gene US28 encodes a homolog of a human
chemokine receptor that is able to bind several chemokines and HIV gp120. Deep
sequencing technologies were used to sequence US28 directly from 60 clinical
samples from Indonesian HIV patients and Australian renal transplant recipients, 
healthy adults, and neonates. Molecular modeling approaches were used to predict 
whether nine nonsynonymous mutations in US28 may alter protein binding to a panel
of six chemokines and two variants of HIV gp120. Ninety-two percent of samples
contained more than one variant of HCMV, as defined by at least one nonsynonymous
mutation. Carriage of these variants differed between neonates and adults,
Australian and Indonesian samples, and saliva samples and blood leukocytes. Two
nonsynonymous mutations (N170D and R267K) were associated with increased levels
of immediate early protein 1 (IE-1) and glycoprotein B (gB) HCMV-reactive
antibodies, suggesting a higher viral burden. Seven of the nine mutations were
predicted to alter binding of at least one ligand. Overall, HCMV variants are
common in all populations and have the potential to affect US28 interactions with
human chemokines and/or gp120 and alter responses to the virus. The findings
relied on deep sequencing technologies applied directly to clinical samples, so
the variants exist in vivo. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common
viral pathogen of solid organ transplant recipients, neonates, and HIV-infected
individuals. HCMV encodes homologs of several host genes with the potential to
influence viral persistence and/or pathogenesis. Here, we present deep sequencing
of an HCMV chemokine receptor homolog, US28, acquired directly from clinical
specimens. Carriage of these variants differed between patient groups and was
associated with different levels of circulating HCMV-reactive antibodies. These
features are consistent with a role for US28 in HCMV persistence and
pathogenesis. This was supported by in silico analyses of the variant sequences
demonstrating altered ligand-binding profiles. The data delineate a novel
approach to understanding the pathogenesis of HCMV and may impact the development
of an effective vaccine.
