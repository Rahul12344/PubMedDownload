OBJECTIVE: Complications affect the outcome of patients with cirrhosis. The
favorable prognosis of patients with Wilson disease (WD)-related cirrhosis
suggests that its complications differ from those of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection-related cirrhosis. We aimed to delineate the differences in
complications between WD-related and HBV-related cirrhosis.
METHODS: The electronic-medical data from patients with WD-related and
HBV-related cirrhosis were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 211 patients with WD-related cirrhosis and 374 patients with
HBV-related cirrhosis were enrolled. Most patients with WD progressed to
cirrhosis <10 years after disease onset, whereas those with HBV infection often
progressed after >10 years. Patients with WD-related cirrhosis had a markedly
lower prevalence of ascites (8.5% vs. 38.5%), gastroesophageal varices/variceal
bleeding (13.3% vs. 47.6%), renal impairment (0 vs. 7.6%) and primary liver
cancer (0 vs. 39.3%; all p < .001) than those with HBV-related cirrhosis. After
adjustment for potential confounders, patients with WD-related cirrhosis carried 
a lower risk of varices/variceal bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with WD progressed to cirrhosis much faster, the
prevalence of complications from WD-related cirrhosis was low. Patients with
WD-related cirrhosis were less likely to develop gastroesophageal
varices/variceal bleeding than those with HBV-related cirrhosis.
