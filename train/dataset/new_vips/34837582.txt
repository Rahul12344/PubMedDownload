After its emergence in late 2019 SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization on 11 March 2020 and has claimed more than 2.8 million lives.
There has been a massive global effort to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and
the rapid and low cost production of large quantities of vaccine is urgently
needed to ensure adequate supply to both developed and developing countries.
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are composed of viral antigens that self-assemble
into structures that mimic the structure of native viruses but lack the viral
genome. Thus they are not only a safer alternative to attenuated or inactivated
vaccines but are also able to induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses
and can be manufactured recombinantly in expression systems that do not require
viral replication. VLPs have successfully been produced in bacteria, yeast,
insect and mammalian cell cultures, each production platform with its own
advantages and limitations. Plants offer a number of advantages in one production
platform, including proper eukaryotic protein modification and assembly,
increased safety, low cost, high scalability as well as rapid production speed, a
critical factor needed to control outbreaks of potential pandemics. Plant-based
VLP-based viral vaccines currently in clinical trials include, amongst others,
Hepatitis B virus, Influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Here we discuss the
importance of plants as a next generation expression system for the fast,
scalable and low cost production of VLP-based vaccines.
