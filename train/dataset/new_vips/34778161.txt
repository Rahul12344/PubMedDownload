The COVID-19 virus has devastated lives and economies worldwide. The responses of
nursing teams to large-scale COVID-19 screening have rarely been addressed or
described. The aim of this study is to introduce an efficient response strategy
for nurses in large-scale COVID-19 screening. A new COVID-19 case was confirmed
on Jan 14, 2021 in Nanning, China. Immediately, a large-scale COVID-19 screening 
was launched and ran from Jan 14 to Jan 17, 2021. Our nurse team responding to
the screening included three major components: (1) establishing a leadership
group and a nucleic acid sampling emergency team; (2) defining, conducting, and
evaluating nurse training; (3) implementing efficient sampling schemes (10 in 1
mixed sample technique). A total of 500 nurse volunteers were recruited and
divided into three echelons. A total of 353 trained nurses were sent to 65
sampling stand stations. In cooperation with nurses from other health
institutions, samples were collected from a total of 854,215 people in only 4
days for 2019-nCOV nucleic acid screening. The preparation and efficient response
strategies used to conduct this screening may provide a baseline reference for
future large-scale COVID-19 screening worldwide.
