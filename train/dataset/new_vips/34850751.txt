Background: To curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
several guidelines for dental practice were proposed by dental practice
regulating bodies. Assessing the level of compliance to these guidelines by
dental personnel will provide an evidence-based report of their adherence to
COVID-19 guidance and if improvement on this is required.
Aim: To assess the risk of exposure of dental personnel to COVID-19 in the dental
facility and their level of compliance with COVID-19 guidance for the dental
practice.
Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at the Dental
Centre of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, (LUTH) Lagos, Nigeria.
Participants were dental personnel (resident doctors/house officers, dental
nurses, dental hygienists and dental technologists) at the Dental Centre, LUTH.
COVID-19 risk assessment and compliance with COVID-19 dental practice guidance
were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire.
Results: A total of 131 dental personnel aged 29.4 Â± 5.16 years participated in
this study. High risk of COVID-19 exposure was noted in trainees in conservative 
dentistry, paediatric dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and in dental
hygienists. Eight dental personnel (6.1%) reported a confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19. Majority of included specialties reported a low (<50%) to moderate
(>50%- <80%) level of compliance with the pre-treatment, during treatment and
post-treatment guidance.
Conclusion: Although dental personnel at the Dental Centre, LUTH had a high risk 
of exposure to COVID-19, they showed low-to-moderate compliance with
pre-treatment, during treatment and post-treatment guidance which led to a
relatively high incidence of COVID-19 transmission in the dental clinic.
