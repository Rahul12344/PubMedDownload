INTRODUCTION: HS-10234, a novel prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), functions by
inhibiting nucleotide reverse transcriptase against retroviral infections
including hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As it is a
possible substitute for TFV co-administration with emtricitabine, determining the
drug-drug interactions (DDI) between HS-10234 and emtricitabine therapy will be
helpful for researchers to design and conduct future phase II/III studies and
merits careful examination in the era of evolving new combination antiretroviral 
therapy regimens.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label, two-sequence, two-period, self-controlled
phase I trial that enrolled 36 healthy volunteers randomized into two groups
(group 1 and group 2). Eighteen subjects in group 1 were orally administered
HS-10234 at a 25-mg daily dose for 7 days during period 1 (D1-D7) followed by
co-administration of emtricitabine at a 200-mg dose once daily (QD) for 7
additional days during period 2 (D8-D14). Participants in group 2 were orally
administered emtricitabine 200 mg QD for 7 days during period 1 (D1-D7) and then 
co-administered HS-10234 25 mg QD for 7 additional days during period 2 (D8-D14).
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of HS-10234 and emtricitabine were characterized when
administered alone and in combination. The concentrations of HS-10234 and its
metabolites TFV and emtricitabine were determined using high performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)/MS. Peripheral blood monocyte cells
(PBMCs) were isolated for detection of intracellular concentrations of HS-10234's
active metabolite, intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) pre-dose and 2,
4, 8, 12 and 24 h post-dose on D7 and D14 in group 1. WinNonlin software was used
to calculate PK parameters.
RESULTS: After multiple-dose administration of HS-10234 with emtricitabine, the
AUC0-tau of HS-10234 and TFV-DP was 1.327- and 1.403-fold higher than that with
HS-10234 administration alone. The Cmax and AUC0-tau were increased 1.120- and
1.077-fold compared to emtricitabine administration alone. Co-administration of
HS-10234 with oral emtricitabine was well tolerated. No serious adverse events
were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a slightly increased steady-state PK exposure of HS-10234
and TFV-DP was observed with co-administration of oral HS-10234 with
emtricitabine, these changes were not considered clinically relevant. Thus, dose 
adjustments are not recommended for HS-10234 combination with emtricitabine.
