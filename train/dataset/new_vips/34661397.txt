The naturally occurring nucleotide
3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine-5'-triphosphate (ddhCTP) was recently found to 
exert potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, nucleoside
5'-triphosphates in general are not cell-permeable, which precludes the direct
use of ddhCTP as a therapeutic. To harness the therapeutic potential of this
endogenous antiviral nucleotide, we synthesized phosphoramidate prodrug
HLB-0532247 (1) and found it to result in dramatically elevated levels of ddhCTP 
in cells. We compared 1 and 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine (ddhC) and found
that 1 more effectively reduces titers of Zika and West Nile viruses in cell
culture with minimal nonspecific toxicity to host cells. We conclude that 1 is a 
promising antiviral agent based on a novel strategy of facilitating elevated
levels of the endogenous ddhCTP antiviral nucleotide.
