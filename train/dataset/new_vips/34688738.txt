Given a large number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, clinical detection has
proved challenging. The wastewater-based epidemiological paradigm would cover the
clinically escaped asymptomatic individuals owing to the faecal shedding of the
virus. We hypothesised using wastewater as a valuable resource for analysing
SARS-CoV-2 mutations circulating in the wastewater of Pune region (Maharashtra;
India), one of the most affected during the covid-19 pandemic. We conducted study
in open wastewater drains from December 2020-March 2021 to assess the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and further detect mutations using ARTIC protocol of
MinION sequencing. The analysis revealed 108 mutations across six samples
categorised into 39 types of mutations. We report the occurrence of mutations
associated with Delta variant lineage in March-2021 samples, simultaneously also 
reported as a Variant of Concern (VoC) responsible for the rapid increase in
infections. The study also revealed four mutations; S:N801, S:C480R, NSP14:C279F 
and NSP3:L550del not currently reported from wastewater or clinical data in India
but reported worldwide. Further, a novel mutation NSP13:G206F mapping to NSP13
region was observed from wastewater. Notably, S:P1140del mutation was detected in
December 2020 samples while it was reported in February 2021 from clinical data, 
indicating the instrumentality of wastewater data in early detection. This is the
first study in India to demonstrate utility of sequencing in wastewater-based
epidemiology to identify mutations associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus fragments
from wastewater as an early warning indicator system.
