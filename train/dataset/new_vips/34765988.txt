In June 2021, over 200 stakeholders, advocates, and visionaries gathered to
launch the Healthy Hawai'i Strategic Plan 2030 (HHSP), a 10-year strategic plan
for improving the health of Hawai'i residents by preventing and reducing chronic 
disease and advancing health equity. The HHSP is a guide to enable coordination
across common risk factors, program areas, interventions, and strategies for
chronic disease prevention and control. Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic,
which revealed major areas of susceptibility in our health system infrastructure 
and magnified existing disparities, the HHSP prioritizes health equity and
strives to create sustainable change to transform communities, schools, health
care and worksites to support the health of the people of Hawai'i. The HHSP is a 
living document and partners - present and future - are invited to work together 
to achieve a healthier future for the people of Hawai'i.
