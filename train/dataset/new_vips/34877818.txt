The multiple mutations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) virus have created variants with structural differences in both
their spike and nucleocapsid proteins. While the functional relevance of these
mutations is under continuous scrutiny, current findings have documented their
detrimental impact in terms of affinity with host receptors, antibody resistance,
and diagnostic sensitivity. Raman spectra collected on two British variant
sub-types found in Japan (QK002 and QHN001) are compared with that of the
original Japanese isolate (JPN/TY/WK-521), and found bold vibrational
differences. These included: i) fractions of sulfur-containing amino acid
rotamers, ii) hydrophobic interactions of tyrosine phenol ring, iii) apparent
fractions of RNA purines and pyrimidines, and iv) protein secondary structures.
Building upon molecular scale results and their statistical validations, the
authors propose to represent virus variants with a barcode specially tailored on 
Raman spectrum. Raman spectroscopy enables fast identification of virus variants,
while the Raman barcode facilitates electronic recordkeeping and translates
molecular characteristics into information rapidly accessible by users.
