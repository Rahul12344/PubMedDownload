The modest protective effects of the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial have prompted the 
further exploration of improved poxvirus vector systems that can yield better
immune responses and protection. In this study, a recombinant lumpy skin disease 
virus (LSDV) expressing HIV-1 CAP256.SU gp150 (Env) and a subtype C mosaic Gag
was constructed (LSDVGC5) and compared to the equivalent recombinant modified
vaccinia Ankara (MVAGC5). In vitro characterization confirmed that cells infected
with recombinant LSDV produced Gag virus-like particles containing Env, and that 
Env expressed on the surface of the cells infected with LSDV was in a native-like
conformation. This candidate HIV-1 vaccine (L) was tested in a rabbit model using
different heterologous vaccination regimens, in combination with DNA (D) and MVA 
(M) vectors expressing the equivalent HIV-1 antigens. The four different
vaccination regimens (DDMMLL, DDMLML, DDLMLM, and DDLLMM) all elicited high
titers of binding and Tier 1A neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and some regimens
induced Tier 1B NAbs. Furthermore, two rabbits in the DDLMLM group developed low 
levels of autologous Tier 2 NAbs. The humoral immune responses elicited against
HIV-1 Env by the recombinant LSDVGC5 were comparable to those induced by MVAGC5.
