Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, but life-threatening disorder
of pathologic immune system activation which results in a hyperinflammatory
state. Previous studies have suggested that hematologic malignancies are often
inciting factors for HLH and portend a poorer prognosis. However, the substantial
overlap between features of hematologic malignancies and HLH makes recognition
and prompt diagnosis of HLH a complex and difficult task. We present a case of a 
young male who presented with acute dyspnea on exertion, unintentional weight
loss, and fatigue. He was found to have pancytopenia, fever, splenomegaly, and
Epstein-Barr viremia and was subsequently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing
Hodgkin lymphoma. Five of eight 2004-HLH criteria were met and the patient was
started on intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 daily), acyclovir, and AAVD
(brentuximab, doxorubicin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy protocol with
improvement in his symptoms and laboratory findings.
