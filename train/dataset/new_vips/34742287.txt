BACKGROUND: High-throughput next-generation sequencing (HT-NGS) has the potential
to detect a large variety of pathogens; however, the application of HT-NGS in
lung transplant (LTx) recipients remains limited. We aimed to evaluate the value 
of HT-NGS for pathogen detection and diagnosis of pulmonary infection during
early-stage post-lung transplantation.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 51 LTx recipients who underwent
lung transplantation between January 2020 and December 2020. Bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for the detection of pathogens using
both HT-NGS and conventional microbiological testing. The detection of pathogens 
and diagnostic performance of HT-NGS were compared with that of conventional
methods.
RESULTS: HT-NGS provided a higher positive rate of pathogen detection than
conventional microbiological testing (88.24% vs. 76.47%). The most common
bacteria detected via HT-NGS during early-stage post-lung transplantation were
Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, while all fungi were
Candida and all viruses were Herpesvirus. Uncommon pathogens, including
Strongyloides, Legionella, and Mycobacterium abscesses were identified by HT-NGS.
The sensitivity of HT-NGS for diagnosing pulmonary infection was significantly
higher than that of conventional microbiological testing (97.14% vs. 68.57%;
P < 0.001). For three LTx recipients, treatment regimens were adjusted according 
to the results of HT-NGS, leading to a complete recovery.
CONCLUSION: HT-NGS is a highly sensitive technique for pathogen detection, which 
may provide diagnostic advantages, especially in LTx recipients, contributing to 
the optimization of treatment regimens against pulmonary infection during
early-stage post-lung transplantation.
