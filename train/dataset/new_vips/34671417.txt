Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) can unforeseeably cross the species barriers and
directly infect humans, which pose huge challenges for public health and trigger 
pandemic risk at irregular intervals. Computational tools are needed to predict
infection phenotype and early pandemic risk of SIVs. For this purpose, we propose
a feature representation algorithm to predict cross-species infection of SIVs. We
built a high-quality dataset of 1902 viruses. A feature representation learning
scheme was applied to learn feature representations from 64 well-trained random
forest models with multiple feature descriptors of mutant amino acid in the viral
proteins, including compositional information, position-specific information, and
physicochemical properties. Class and probabilistic information were integrated
into the feature representations, and redundant features were removed by feature 
space optimization. High performance was achieved using 20 informative features
and 22 probabilistic information. The proposed method will facilitate SIV
characterization of transmission phenotype.
