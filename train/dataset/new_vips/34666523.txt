Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas adaptive
immune systems enable bacteria and archaea to efficiently respond to viral
pathogens by creating a genomic record of previous encounters. These systems are 
broadly distributed across prokaryotic taxa, yet are surprisingly absent in a
majority of organisms, suggesting that the benefits of adaptive immunity
frequently do not outweigh the costs. Here, combining experiments and models, we 
show that a delayed immune response which allows viruses to transiently redirect 
cellular resources to reproduction, which we call 'immune lag', is extremely
costly during viral outbreaks, even to completely immune hosts. Critically, the
costs of lag are only revealed by examining the early, transient dynamics of a
host-virus system occurring immediately after viral challenge. Lag is a basic
parameter of microbial defence, relevant to all intracellular, post-infection
antiviral defence systems, that has to-date been largely ignored by theoretical
and experimental treatments of host-phage systems.
