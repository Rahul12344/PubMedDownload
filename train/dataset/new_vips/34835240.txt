A panel of potent neutralizing antibodies are protective against orthopoxvirus
(OPXV) infections. For the development of OPXV-specific recombinant human
single-chain antibodies (scFvs), the IgG repertoire of four vaccinated donors was
amplified from peripheral B-lymphocytes. The resulting library consisted of ≥4 × 
108 independent colonies. The immuno-screening against vaccinia virus (VACV)
Elstree revealed a predominant selection of scFv clones specifically binding to
the D8 protein. The scFv-1.2.2.H9 was engineered into larger human
scFv-Fc-1.2.2.H9 and IgG1-1.2.2.H9 formats to improve the binding affinity and to
add effector functions within the human immune response. Similar binding kinetics
were calculated for scFv-1.2.2.H9 and scFv-Fc-1.2.2.H9 (1.61 nM and 7.685 nM,
respectively), whereas, for IgG1-1.2.2.H9, the Michaelis-Menten kinetics revealed
an increased affinity of 43.8 pM. None of the purified recombinant 1.2.2.H9
formats were able to neutralize VACV Elstree in vitro. After addition of 1% human
complement, the neutralization of ≥50% of VACV Elstree was achieved with 0.0776
µM scFv-Fc-1.2.2.H9 and 0.01324 µM IgG1-1.2.2.H9, respectively. In an in vivo
passive immunization NMRI mouse model, 100 µg purified scFv-1.2.2.H9 and the
IgG1-1.2.2.H9 partially protected against the challenge with 4 LD50 VACV Munich
1, as 3/6 mice survived. In contrast, in the scFv-Fc-1.2.2.H9 group, only one
mouse survived the challenge.
