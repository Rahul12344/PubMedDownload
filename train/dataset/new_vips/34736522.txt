OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people
worldwide. Psychological resilience has been shown to buffer against the threat
of the pandemic (i.e., COVID-19 fear) and sustain mental health. The extent to
which psychological resilience factors impact mental health maintenance, however,
is unclear, given broad differences in infection rates, prevention approaches,
government interventions across different cultures and contexts. Our study
examines resilience factors and how they protect individuals from
COVID-19-related fear and sustain their mental health.
DATA DESCRIPTION: Data were collected from 1583 (Mage = 32.22, SD = 12.90,
Range = 19-82) respondents from Japan, China, the United States, and Malaysia
between October to November 2020. We collected data across age and sex, marital
status, number of children, and occupations. We also accounted for stay-at-home
measures, change in income, COVID-19 infection status, place of residence, and
subjective social status in the study. Our variables included mental
health-related and resilience constructs, namely (i) fear of COVID-19, (ii)
depression, anxiety, and stress; (iii) present, past, and future life
satisfaction, (iv) sense of control, (v) positive emotions, (vi) ego-resilience, 
(vii) grit, (viii) self-compassion, (ix) passion, and (x) relational mobility.
All questionnaires were assessed for their suitability across the four countries 
with the necessary translation checks. Results from this study can be
instrumental in examining the impact of multiple resilience factors and their
interaction with demographic variables in shaping mental health outcomes.
