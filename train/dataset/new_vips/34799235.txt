Single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), whose full capabilities have
been realized only within the past decade, has had a pivotal role in the fight
against COVID-19. This is due to the technique's intrinsic power to depict both
structural and dynamic features of molecules; in this case, of the spike protein 
of SARS-CoV-2. By now, numerous cryo-EM studies have furthered our understanding 
of spike protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interactions,
which has informed the design of effective vaccines, and have enabled the
characterization of neutralizing antibody binding sites, which will lead to the
design of novel therapeutics as the virus evolves.
