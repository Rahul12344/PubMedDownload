Background: In middle-income countries such as Vietnam, where healthcare
resources are already constrained, protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) is
essential for ensuring the sustainability of COVID-19 response in Vietnam. This
study was conducted to assess the knowledge and practices regarding the
prevention of the COVID-19 among the HCWs in Vietnam to identify the ways of
disseminating information to maximize the safety of these essential workers.
Methods: An online cross-sectional study, using respondent-driven sampling, was
conducted in Vietnam with 742 participants within 2 weeks. The validity of the
questionnaire was examined by exploratory factor analysis. Descriptive statistics
were used to identify the level of knowledge and practices among the HCWs to
prevent the COVID-19. Inferential statistics and regression modeling were used to
identify the associated factors with results. Results: Vietnamese HCWs had a high
level of knowledge with more than 75% of the participants demonstrating awareness
of all the modes of transmission aside from air. The mean knowledge score was 3.7
± 0.8 (range 1-5). Nearly all the participants relied on the Ministry of Health
(98.3%) and the internet (95.5%) for information regarding the COVID-19. The
participants endorsed a moderately high level of self-protective practices with
mean scores of 4.2 and 3.6 (band score 1-5) for the precautionary and
psychological measures, respectively. Nurses were more likely to practice the
precautionary measures than doctors and the HCWs at the central level were more
likely to practice the psychological measures than those at the district level.
Conclusion: Future education initiatives should consolidate the latest literature
in an accessible format, focusing initially on the gaps of knowledge regarding
aerosol transmission. These initiatives should primarily focus on the doctors,
especially those in emergency and intensive care departments.
