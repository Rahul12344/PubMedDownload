The fundamental biological roles of a class of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs),
derived from mature tRNAs or pre-tRNAs, in human diseases have received
increasing attention in recent years. These ncRNAs are called tRNA-derived
fragments (tRFs) or tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). tRFs mainly include tRF-1, 
tRF-5, tRF-3 and tRNA halves (tiRNAs or tRHs), which are produced by
enzyme-specific cleavage of tRNAs. Here, we classify tRF-5 and 5' tiRNAs into the
same category: 5'-tRFs and review the biological functions and regulatory
mechanisms of 5'-tRFs in cancer and other diseases (metabolic diseases,
neurodegenerative diseases, pathological stress injury and virus infection) to
provide a new theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
