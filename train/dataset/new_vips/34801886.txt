OBJECTIVES: Cryptococcal meningitis constitutes a significant source of mortality
in the developing world. Annually, approximately 625 000 deaths occur worldwide
among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This study aims
to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing cryptococcal antigen lateral
flow assay (CRAG-LFA) screening in Brazil compared with the current practice.
METHODS: An economic evaluation using a Monte Carlo microsimulation was
conducted, considering the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System, to 
calculate the cost-effectiveness of 4 diagnosis tests: (1) CRAG-LFA, (2) the
cryptococcal antigen latex agglutination (CRAG-LA) test, (3) India ink, and (4)
nontracking as a baseline. The time horizon comprised 1 year for the intervention
and 5 years for the budgetary impact analysis. Two primary effectiveness outcomes
were considered: years of life and quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: CRAG-LFA has extended dominance vis à vis CRAG-LA and India ink.
CRAG-LFA would cost $418.46 more than CRAG-LA for the treatment of each
symptomatic patient living with HIV, with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio
of $2478.75/quality-adjusted life year. The budgetary impact analysis estimated
that the incorporation of CRAG-LFA would have an additional cost of $1 959 236.50
in 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, for patients living with HIV in the
Brazilian Public Health System, the adoption of CRAG-LFA screening is
cost-effective compared with the use of CRAG-LA and India ink. It represents an
opportunity to prevent cryptococcal meningitis and its mortality in Brazil.
