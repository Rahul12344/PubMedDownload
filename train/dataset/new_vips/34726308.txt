Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human
coronavirus and the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There
is an urgent need for effective antivirals to treat current Covid-19 cases and
protect those unable to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Marine molluscs live in
an environment containing high virus densities (>107 virus particles per ml), and
there are an estimated 100,000 species in the phylum Mollusca, demonstrating the 
success of their innate immune system. Mollusc-derived antivirals are yet to be
used clinically despite the activity of many extracts, including against human
viruses, being demonstrated in vitro. Hemolymph of the Pacific oyster
(Crassostrea gigas) has in vitro antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 
and human adenovirus, while antiviral action against SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed
by in silico studies. Such evidence suggests that molluscs, and in particular C. 
gigas hemolymph, may represent a source of antivirals for human coronaviruses.
