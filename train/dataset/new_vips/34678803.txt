With the emergence of a global coronavirus pandemic, traditional timelines and
methods for staff education were met with significant challenges. Nurse
educators, in collaboration with subject matter experts and leadership, needed to
overcome obstacles and utilized a variety of resources to quickly create training

led the hospital to be prepared for an unprecedented number of inpatient
admissions.
