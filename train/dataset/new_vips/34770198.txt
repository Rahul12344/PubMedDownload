Citizens are increasingly turning to social media to open up debates on issues of
utmost importance, such as health or education. When analyzing citizens' social
media interactions on COVID-19, research has underlined the importance of sharing
and spreading information based on scientific evidence rather than on fake news. 
However, whether and how citizens' interactions in the field of education,
particularly in mathematics, are based on scientific evidence remains
underexplored. To contribute to filling this gap, this article presents an
analysis of citizen debates in social networks about didactic resources for
mathematics. Through social media analytics, 136,964 posts were extracted from
Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, of which 1755 were analyzed. Results
show that out of the 213 posts of citizen debates on didactic resources for
mathematics, only two contained scientific evidence and eight claimed to contain 
scientific evidence. These findings highlight the importance of promoting actions
to encourage citizen debates around didactic resources for mathematics based on
scientific evidence.
