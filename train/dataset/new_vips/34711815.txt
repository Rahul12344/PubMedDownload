The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires adequate coverage 
of vaccine protection. We evaluated whether a SARS-CoV-2 spike ferritin
nanoparticle vaccine (SpFN), adjuvanted with the Army Liposomal Formulation QS21 
(ALFQ), conferred protection against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), and Beta (B.1.351) VOCs
in Syrian golden hamsters. SpFN-ALFQ was administered as either single or
double-vaccination (0 and 4 week) regimens, using a high (10 μg) or low (0.2 μg) 
dose. Animals were intranasally challenged at week 11. Binding antibody responses
were comparable between high- and low-dose groups. Neutralizing antibody titers
were equivalent against WA1, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants following two high
dose vaccinations. Dose-dependent SpFN-ALFQ vaccination protected against
SARS-CoV-2-induced disease and viral replication following intranasal B.1.1.7 or 
B.1.351 challenge, as evidenced by reduced weight loss, lung pathology, and lung 
and nasal turbinate viral burden. These data support the development of SpFN-ALFQ
as a broadly protective, next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
