Viruses saturate environments throughout the world and play key roles in
microbial food webs, yet how viral activities affect dissolved organic matter
(DOM) processing in natural environments remains elusive. We established a
large-scale long-term macrocosm experiment to explore viral dynamics and their
potential impacts on microbial mortality and DOM quantity and quality in starved 
and stratified ecosystems. High viral infection dynamics and the virus-induced
cell lysis (6.23-64.68% d-1) was found in the starved seawater macrocosm, which
contributed to a significant transformation of microbial biomass into DOM
(0.72-5.32 μg L-1 d-1). In the stratified macrocosm, a substantial amount of
viral lysate DOM (2.43-17.87 μg L-1 d-1) was released into the upper riverine
water, and viral lysis and DOM release (0.35-5.75 μg L-1 d-1) were reduced in the
mixed water layer between riverine water and seawater. Viral lysis was stimulated
at the bottom of stratified macrocosm, potentially fueled by the sinking of
particulate organic carbon. Significant positive and negative associations
between lytic viral production and different fluorescent DOM components were
found in the starved and stratified macrocosm, indicating the potentially complex
viral impacts on the production and utilization of DOM. Results also revealed the
significant viral contribution to pools of both relatively higher molecular
weight labile DOM and lower molecular weight recalcitrant DOM. Our study suggests
that viruses have heterogeneous impact on the cycling and fate of DOM in aquatic 
environments.
