Few groups of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) that are refractory to
standard chemotherapy are rarely reported. Primary CD20 negative diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) without human immunodeficiency virus infection is an
uncommon presentation and this case report is challenging in terms of diagnosis
and treatment as well.
