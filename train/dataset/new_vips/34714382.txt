PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess for histopathological changes
within the retina and the choroid and determine the long-term sequelae of the
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: Eyes from seven COVID-19-positive and six similar age-matched control
donors with a negative test for SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. Globes were evaluated
ex vivo with macroscopic, SLO and OCT imaging. Macula and peripheral regions were
processed for Epon embedding and immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: Fundus analysis shows hemorrhagic spots and increased vitreous debris in
several of the COVID-19 eyes compared to the controls. OCT-based measurements
indicated an increased trend in retinal thickness in the COVID-19 eyes; however, 
the difference was not statistically significant. Histology of the retina showed 
presence of hemorrhages and central cystoid degeneration in several of the
donors. Whole mount analysis of the retina labeled with markers showed changes in
retinal microvasculature, increased inflammation, and gliosis in the COVID-19
eyes compared to the controls. The choroidal vasculature displayed localized
changes in density and signs of increased inflammation in the COVID-19 samples.
CONCLUSIONS: In situ analysis of the retinal tissue suggests that there are
severe subclinical abnormalities that could be detected in the COVID-19 eyes.
This study provides a rationale for evaluating the ocular physiology of patients 
that have recovered from COVID-19 infections to further understand the long-term 
effects caused by this virus.
