The continuous growth of population and the steady improvement of people's living
standards have accelerated the generation of massive food waste. Untreated food
waste has great potential to harm the environment and human health due to bad
odor release, bacterial leaching, and virus transmission. However, the
application of traditional disposal techniques like composting, landfilling,
animal feeding, and anaerobic digestion are difficult to ease the environmental
burdens because of problems such as large land occupation, virus transmission,
hazardous gas emissions, and poor efficiency. Pyrolysis is a practical and
promising route to reduce the environmental burden by converting food waste into 
bioenergy. This paper aims to analyze the characteristics of food waste,
introduce the production of biofuels from conventional and advanced pyrolysis of 
food waste, and provide a basis for scientific disposal and sustainable
management of food waste. The review shows that co-pyrolysis and catalytic
pyrolysis significantly impact the pyrolysis process and product characteristics.
The addition of tire waste promotes the synthesis of hydrocarbons and inhibits
the formation of oxygenated compounds efficiently. The application of calcium
oxide (CaO) exhibits good performance in the increment of bio-oil yield and
hydrocarbon content. Based on this literature review, pyrolysis can be considered
as the optimal technique for dealing with food waste and producing valuable
products.
