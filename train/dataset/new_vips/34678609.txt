Interferons are innate and adaptive cytokines involved in many biological
responses, in particular, viral infections. With the final response the result of
the balance of the different types of Interferons. Cytokine storms are
physiological reactions observed in humans and animals in which the innate immune
system causes an uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory signaling
molecules. The excessive and prolonged presence of these cytokines can cause
tissue damage, multisystem organ failure and death. The role of Interferons in
virus clearance, tissue damage and cytokine storms are discussed, in view of
COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
The imbalance of Type I, Type II and Type III Interferons during a viral
infection contribute to the clinical outcome, possibly together with other
cytokines, in particular, TNFα, with clear implications for clinical
interventions to restore their correct balance.
