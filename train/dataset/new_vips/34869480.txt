Background: The patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with
severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may require prolonged
mechanical ventilation which often results in lung fibrosis, thus worsening the
prognosis and increasing fatality rates. A mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy
may decrease lung inflammation and accelerate recovery in COVID-19. In this
context, some studies have reported the effects of MSC therapy for patients not
requiring invasive ventilation or during the first hours of tracheal intubation. 
However, this is the first case report presenting the reduction of not only lung 
inflammation but also lung fibrosis in a critically ill long-term mechanically
ventilated patient with COVID-19. Case Presentation: This is a case report of a
30-year-old male patient with COVID-19 under invasive mechanical ventilation for 
14 days in the intensive care unit (ICU), who presented progressive clinical
deterioration associated with lung fibrosis. The symptoms onset was 35 days
before MSC therapy. The patient was treated with allogenic human umbilical-cord
derived MSCs [5 × 107 (2 doses 2 days interval)]. No serious adverse events were 
observed during and after MSC administration. After MSC therapy, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
increased, the need for vasoactive drugs reduced, chest CT scan imaging, which
initially showed signs of bilateral and peripheral ground-glass, as well as
consolidation and fibrosis, improved, and the systemic mediators associated with 
inflammation decreased. Modulation of the different cell populations in
peripheral blood was also observed, such as a reduction in inflammatory monocytes
and an increase in the frequency of patrolling monocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, and
type 2 classical dendritic cells (cDC2). The patient was discharged 13 days after
the cell therapy. Conclusions: Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy may be a
promising option in critically ill patients with COVID-19 presenting both severe 
lung inflammation and fibrosis. Further clinical trials could better assess the
efficacy of MSC therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with lung
fibrosis associated with long-term mechanical ventilation.
