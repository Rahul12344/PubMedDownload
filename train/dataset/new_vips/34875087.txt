BACKGROUND: The Seraph®100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter® is a hemoperfusion
device that is licensed for the reduction of pathogens, including several
viruses, in the blood. It received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the
treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the FDA. Several
studies have shown that the blood viral load of SARS-CoV-2 correlates with
adverse outcomes and removal of the nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the
Seraph®100 has been recently demonstrated. The aim of this registry was to
evaluate safety and efficacy of Seraph®100 treatment for COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: Twelve hospitals from six countries representing two continents
documented patient and treatment characteristics as well as outcome parameters
without reimbursement. Additionally, mortality and safety results of the device
were reported. One hundred-and-two treatment sessions in 82 patients were
documented in the registry. Four patients were excluded from mortality analysis
due to incomplete outcome data, which were available in the other 78 patients.
RESULTS: Overall, a 30-day mortality rate of 46.2% in the 78 patients with
complete follow up was reported. Median treatment time was 5.00 [4.00-13.42] h.
and 43.1% of the treatments were performed as hemoperfusion only. Adverse events 
of the Seraph®100 treatment were reported in 8.8% of the 102 treatments and
represented premature end of treatment due to circuit failure. Patients that died
were treated later in their ICU stay and onset of COVID symptoms. They also had
higher ferritin levels. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that delayed
Seraph®100 treatment after ICU admission (>60 hours) as well as bacterial
superinfection were associated with mortality. While average predicted mortality 
rate according to SOFA score in ICU patients was 56.7% the observed mortality was
50.7%. In non-ICU patients 4C-Score average predicted a mortality rate of 38.0%
while the observed mortality rate was 11.1.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of COVID-19 patients with Seraph®100 is well tolerated
and the circuit failure rate was lower than previously reported for KRT in
COVID-19 patients. Mortality corelated with late initiation of Seraph treatment
after ICU admission and bacterial superinfection infection. Compared to predicted
mortality according to 4C-Score and SOFA Score, mortality of Seraph®100 treated
patients reported in the registry was lower.
