Rhabdoviridae is the most diverse family of the negative, single-stranded RNA
viruses, which includes 40 ecologically different genera that infect plants,
insects, reptiles, fishes, and mammals, including humans, and birds. To date,
only a few bird-related rhabdoviruses among the genera Sunrhavirus, Hapavirus,
and Tupavirus have been described and analyzed at the molecular level. In this
study, we characterized seven additional and previously unclassified
rhabdoviruses, which were isolated from various bird species collected in Africa 
during the 1960s and 1970s. Based on the analysis of their genome sequences
obtained by next generation sequencing, we observed a classical genomic
structure, with the presence of the five canonical rhabdovirus genes, i.e.,
nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and 
polymerase (L). In addition, different additional open reading frames which code 
putative proteins of unknown function were identified, with the common presence
of the C and the SH proteins, within the P gene and between the M and G genes,
respectively. Genetic comparisons and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that
these seven bird-related rhabdoviruses could be considered as putative new
species within the genus Sunrhavirus, where they clustered into a single group
(named Clade III), a companion to two other groups that encompass mainly
insect-related viruses. The results of this study shed light on the high
diversity of the rhabdoviruses circulating in birds, mainly in Africa. Their
close relationship with other insect-related sunrhaviruses raise questions about 
their potential role and impact as arboviruses that affect bird communities.
