OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies persistence among HCWs and specifically among asymptomatic HCWs. A
secondary objective is to determine the duration of persistent SARS-CoV-2
antibodies post infection and factors affecting this duration. The findings are
expected to open the door for further research into the role of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODOLOGY: HCWs were divided into high, intermediate, and low risk based on
their type and location of work. All participants filled a questionnaire. Blood
samples were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/total antibodies. A documented
SARS-CoV-2 PCR or Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/total antibodies defined the primary
outcome. The probability of persistence of antibody was calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier estimator. Logistic and Cox regression were used where appropriate.
RESULTS: A total of 1111 HCWs were included. The median age 37 years (IQR:
31-43). More than half (67.2%) were females. The primary outcome was seen in 373 
(33.6%) participants with a median age of 36 years (IQR: 29-41). Only 37.2% of
those with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR had reactive serology, while only
16.2% of those with reactive serology had documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR.
Male gender (OR 0.44, P < 0.001) and older age (OR 0.98, P < 0.019) were
associated with a lower risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. The probability
of persistent SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at six months was 60.2% (95% CI:
49.5%-73.1%). Omanis had a higher probability of losing the antibody than others 
(HR 2.63, P = 0.021).
CONCLUSION: We report a high prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs 
in Oman, specifically among asymptomatic HCWs. Community was the most likely
source of infection. Therefore, the society must adhere to the roles and
regulations set to reduce the risk of transmission. We demonstrate a high
percentage of seroconversion post initial infection, and the persistence of
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at six months in more than half of those previously
infected. We demonstrated a new interesting finding of fast decline of SARS-CoV2 
antibody levels over time among different nationalities and this requires further
research.
