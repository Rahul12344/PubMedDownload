BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) partner services (PS) are an
essential component of comprehensive HIV prevention and care. We examined factors
associated with partner notification, HIV testing, and HIV positivity among
partners of HIV diagnosed persons (index persons) contacted by CDC-funded state
and local health departments.
METHODS: We analyzed PS data submitted to CDC by 61 state and local health
departments from 2013-2017. Using multivariate Poisson regression-adjusted for
clustering effects among partners reported by a common index person-we assessed
association between three outcomes of interest (partner notification, HIV
testing, and HIV positivity) and the demographic characteristics, risk behaviors,
geographic region, and service year of index persons and their partners.
RESULTS: A total of 51,368 sexual and/or needle-sharing partners were matched
with 33,524 index persons. Of notifiable partners, 97.2% were notified of their
potential HIV exposure, 52.3% were tested for HIV. Among 21,842 notified and
tested partners, 23.8% were newly diagnosed with an HIV infection. Partner
notification, HIV testing, and HIV positivity were associated with both partner
and index person characteristics (individually and interactively), geographic
region, and year of service.
CONCLUSIONS: PS programs provided through CDC-funded health departments are
effective in both partner notification and identification of undiagnosed HIV
infection among partners. However, HIV testing rates among notified partners
remains low. Implementing strategies to address gaps in HIV testing can
contribute towards ending the HIV epidemic in the United States.
