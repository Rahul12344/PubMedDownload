Financial inclusion is strongly differentiated by age groups and countries and
the pandemic has highlighted the increased gaps and inequalities but also the
weaknesses of the system, in terms of flexibility, access and facilities of the
customer-bank relationship and also from the perspective of the financial
education of young generations and vulnerable people, active in the labor market.
Based on the available data provided by the Global Findex database, and some
findings after more than one year of COVID-19 crisis we outlined the main aspects
of financial digitization, by categories of people and countries. At the same
time, we identified the challenges and problems during the pandemic that
significantly adjusted the consumption pattern of citizens and increased the need
for on-line access for financial transactions. Starting from the analysis of the 
inequality of access to financial instruments in the last years, from the
informational asymmetry in financial education and the challenges of the pandemic
period, we underlined the main coordinates of changing the model of sustainable
financial inclusion-based on five pillars-access, education, support tools, CSR
and resilience. The research results highlight the need for convergence in
providing opportunities to consider financial inclusion as a public good and an
active tool to increase consumers' satisfaction and the quality of life of
individuals.
