Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2) is 
an acute respiratory and infectious disease. This perspective aims to provide a
basic understanding of the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its relation to 
the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The virus enters through the mucous membranes of
the orofacial region and reaches the TG, where it resides and takes control of
its peptides including Substance P (SP). SP is the main neuropeptide,
neuromodulator, and neuro-hormone of TG, associated with nociception and
inflammation under noxious stimulus. SP release is triggered and, consequently,
affects the immune cells and blood vessels to release the mediators for
inflammation. Hence, cytokine storm is initiated and causes respiratory distress,
bronchoconstriction, and death in complicated cases. Neurokinin-1 Receptor
(NK-1R) is the receptor for SP and its antagonists, along with glucocorticoids,
may be used to alleviate the symptoms and treat this infection by blocking this
nociceptive pathway. SP seems to be the main culprit involved in the triggering
of inflammatory pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It may have a direct
association with cardio-respiratory rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, nociception, and
ventilatory responses and regulates many important physiological and pathological
functions. Its over-secretion should be blocked by NK-1R antagonist. However,
experimental work leading to clinical trials are mandatory for further
confirmation. Here, it is further proposed that there is a possibility of latency
in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection if it is acting through TG, which is the main site 
for other viruses that become latent.
