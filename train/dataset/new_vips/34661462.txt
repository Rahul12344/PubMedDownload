BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To characterize patient-identified barriers to care in 
those non-compliant with retina appointments during the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria included non-compliant patients from
March 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Ultimately, 1,345 patients were invited to complete
a 14-question survey. A retrospective chart review correlated clinical and
demographic information. Univariate logistic regression, independent-samples
t-test, and Pearson correlation coefficient identified differences among
subgroups.
RESULTS: Of the 1,345 patients, 181 (13.5%) completed the survey. The most
significant barriers to care included fear of COVID (76/181; 42.0%), wait times
(21/181; 11.6%), and costs (11/181; 6.1%). Patients who got their COVID
information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (7.8 ± 2.4) and
televised news (8.0 ± 2.0) had higher levels of fear. Finally, patients with
diabetic retinopathy and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores had greater
concerns of COVID (P = .034 and P = .047, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This survey study suggests fear of COVID-19 is a prominent new
barrier to retinal care. Identifying those at risk for loss to follow-up can
guide practices as the pandemic continues. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging
