The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the physical and mental health of
many and has necessitated widespread societal shifts, including changes to work
and family activities. These changes have impacted individuals' identity,
including their sexual self-image and body image, yet research on perceptions of 
these changes is missing. This study reports on quantitative and qualitative data
from an electronic survey with adults in the United States (N = 326) to examine
these perceptions. Body appreciation did not significantly differ between
demographic groups. Themes emerging from the qualitative results included changes
in general self-image (becoming more restricted or disempowered), changes in
sexual self-image (deepening, becoming more sexy/sexual, or less sexy/sexual),
and changes in body image (positive, negative, and neutral). Our findings point
to positive, negative, and neutral effects on sexual self-image and body image,
implying that nuanced approaches are needed to understand how identity has
transformed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
