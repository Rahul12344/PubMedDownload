Examining the spread of macroeconomic phenomena between countries has become
increasingly popular after the 2008 economic crisis, but the recent COVID-19
pandemic rendered this issue much more relevant as it shed more light on the
risks arising from strongly interconnected economies. This paper intends to
extend previous studies in this line by examining the relationship between trade 
openness and business cycle synchronization. It extends the scope of previous
analyses in three areas. First, we use a Granger-causality approach to identify
synchronization. Second, trade is broken down to the sector level and third, we
distinguish between upstream and downstream connections. These developments allow
for a directed approach in the analysis. We use conditional logit regressions to 
estimate the effect of trade openness on the probability of shock-transmission.
The results presented in this study contribute to the literature in two ways.
First, in addition to revealing a positive effect of aggregate two-way trade on
shock-contagion, it also points out that this overall effect hides diverse
behavior in specific trading sectors as well as upstream and downstream channels.
Second, while some sectors are not significant channels of shock-transmission in 
either directions, upstream channels seem to be important in agriculture while
downstream channels dominate machinery and other manufactures. Also, there are
sectors (chemicals and related products) trade in which affects
shock-transmission negatively.
