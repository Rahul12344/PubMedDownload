Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for dissecting the
complexity of normal and diseased tissues, enabling characterization of cell
diversity and heterogeneous phenotypic states in unprecedented detail. However,
this technology has been underutilized for exploring the interactions between the
host cell and viral pathogens in latently infected cells. Herein, we use
scRNA-seq and single-molecule sensitivity fluorescent in situ hybridization
(smFISH) technologies to investigate host single-cell transcriptome changes upon 
the reactivation of a human neurotropic virus, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). We
identify the stress sensor growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta
(Gadd45b) as a critical antiviral host factor that regulates HSV-1 reactivation
events in a subpopulation of latently infected primary neurons. We show that
distinct subcellular localization of Gadd45b correlates with the viral late gene 
expression program, as well as the expression of the viral transcription factor, 
ICP4. We propose that a hallmark of a "successful" or "aborted" HSV-1
reactivation state in primary neurons is determined by a unique subcellular
localization signature of the stress sensor Gadd45b.
