OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to investigate the role of middle cerebral 
artery (MCA) Doppler measurements for the prediction of abnormal neonatal
outcomes in pregnancies affected by Zika virus (ZIKV).
METHODS:  Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of pregnant women diagnosed 
with ZIKV infection from September 2015 to December 2016 at a single regional
referral center. Ultrasonography with measurements of MCA peak systolic velocity 
(PSV), PSV multiples of the median (MoM) for gestational age, and pulsatility
index (PI) were collected. The primary outcome was a composite abnormal neonatal 
outcome. MCA Doppler values of normal and abnormal neonatal outcomes were
compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test. The predictive value of MCA Dopplers for
development of abnormal neonatal outcome was calculated by logistic regression.
RESULTS:  One-hundred twenty-seven ZIKV-positive pregnancies with MCA Doppler
measurements and known neonatal outcomes were included. Of the 132 neonates, 66
(50%) had an abnormal neonatal outcome. Lower MCA PSV (p = 0.027) and PSV MoM
(p = 0.008) were associated with abnormal neonatal outcomes. There was no
significant difference in MCA PI. Abnormal neonatal outcomes had lower MCA PSV by
5.36 cm/s (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-9.77, p = 0.018) and lower MCA PSV 
MoM by 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05-0.22, p = 0.002). MCA PSV of 30 cm/s had a 65%
predicted probability of an abnormal neonatal outcome (95% CI: 51-79%).
CONCLUSION:  In ZIKV-infected pregnancies, lower MCA PSV and PSV MoM measurements
were seen with abnormal neonatal outcomes. This may represent a physiologic
response to fetal ZIKV infection. Evaluation of MCA Dopplers may be of clinical
utility in the surveillance of ZIKV-affected pregnancies.
KEY POINTS: · Significantly lower MCA PSV is associated with abnormal neonatal
outcomes in ZIKV pregnancies.. · Lower MCA PSV may reflect the underlying
neuropathology of ZIKV exposure on the fetus.. · There is potential utility for
MCA Doppler evaluation in antepartum surveillance of ZIKV pregnancies..
