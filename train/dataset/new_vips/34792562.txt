OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who fail to respond to
methotrexate (MTX) can receive biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(bDMARDs). The Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is a potential novel candidate for
monitoring of immunosuppression. We explore TTV in these patients and association
with clinical response to bDMARDs.
METHODS: The BioBio Study is a multicentre randomized open-label trial, including
RA patients with insufficient response to MTX. Patients were randomized to either
TNFi (infliximab, INF), anti-IL-6 (tocilizumab, TCZ), CTLA4-Ig (abatacept, ABA)
or anti-CD20 (rituximab, RTX) in addition to MTX. PCR was used to quantify TTV in
the peripheral blood.
RESULTS: TTV was measured in 95 patients (INF, n = 23; TCZ, n = 22; ABA, n = 27; 
RTX; n = 23). TTV increased by a median of 4.5*104 copies/ml (c/ml; inter
quartile range [IQR] 0-7.5*105) after 3 months. TTV levels at month 3 were
associated with SDAI (p= 0.03) and CDAI response (p= 0.026) at month 6. A TTV
cut-off level of 1.2*106 c/ml at month 3 had a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7
for prediction of SDAI85% response at month 6.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that TTV levels increase upon TNF, CD20 and
co-stimulation blockade and associate with clinical response to bDMARDs in RA
patients.
