BACKGROUND: The ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses, regularly revised since 1896, may 
not provide guidance in an era of pandemic and sociopolitical unrest.
PURPOSE: This study explored whether the Code of Ethics comprehensively address
current nursing challenges.
METHODS: 23 nurses participated in six Zoom focus groups to discuss whether
provisions were applicable to their current practice. An iterative approach was
used to review transcripts independently and then merge findings to identify
ethical themes.
FINDINGS: Provisions 4, 6, and 8 were most relevant. None of the provisions
addressed the guilt secondary to isolating patients from support systems and not 
being "on the front lines" of COVID care.
DISCUSSION: The co-occurring crises of COVID-19 and social unrest created an
ethical crisis for many nurses. The Code of Ethics provided a useful guide for
framing discussion and formulating strategies for change, but did not eliminate
distress during a time of novel challenges.
