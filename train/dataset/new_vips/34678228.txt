Remdesivir (GS-5734, Veklury®) has remained the only antiviral drug formally
approved by the US FDA for the treatment of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection). Its 
key structural features are the fact that it is a C-nucleoside (adenosine)
analogue, contains a 1'-cyano function, and could be considered as a ProTide
based on the presence of a phosphoramidate group. Its antiviral spectrum and
activity in animal models have been well established and so has been its
molecular mode of action as a delayed chain terminator of the viral RdRp
(RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Its clinical efficacy has been evaluated, but
needs to be optimized with regard to timing, dosage and duration of treatment,
and route of administration. Safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics need to be
further addressed, and so are its potential combinations with other drugs such as
corticosteroids (i.e. dexamethasone) and ribavirin.
