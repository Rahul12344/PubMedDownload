We read with great interest the article "Underrepresentation of older adults in
clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines: A systematic review" written by Nicola
Veronese et al. This important work demonstrated that medications and vaccines
commonly used in older adults have not been adequately evaluated. Concerning this
systematic review, we shall like to mention some certain points deserved to be
attended by the authors.
