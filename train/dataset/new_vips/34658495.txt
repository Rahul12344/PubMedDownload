COVID19 pathogens are primarily transmitted via airborne respiratory droplets
expelled from infected bio-sources. However, there is a lack of simplified
accurate source models that can represent the airborne release to be utilized in 
the safe-social distancing measures and ventilation design of buildings. Although
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can provide accurate models of airborne
disease transmissions, they are computationally expensive. Thus, this study
proposes an innovative framework that benefits from a series of relatively
accurate CFD simulations to first generate a dataset of respiratory events and
then to develop a simplified source model. The dataset has been generated based
on key clinical parameters (i.e., the velocity of droplet release) and
environmental factors (i.e., room temperature and relative humidity) in the
droplet release modes. An Eulerian CFD model is first validated against
experimental data and then interlinked with a Lagrangian CFD model to simulate
trajectory and evaporation of numerous droplets in various sizes (0.1 μm-700 μm).
A risk assessment model previously developed by the authors is then applied to
the simulation cases to identify the horizontal and vertical spread lengths (risk
cloud) of viruses in each case within an exposure time. Eventually, an artificial
neural network-based model is fitted to the spread lengths to develop the
simplified predictive source model. The results identify three main regimes of
risk clouds, which can be fairly predicted by the ANN model.
