BACKGROUND: The increasing infection rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) has
resulted in various complex pregnancy-related complications in recent years. HPV 
can directly pass through the placenta to cause intrauterine infection, leading
to premature delivery or the premature rupture of membranes (PROM).
METHODS: English databases were searched for randomized control trials (RCTs) on 
HPV infection and premature delivery and PROM, including PubMed, Medline, Embase,
and Cochrane Central Register. The search time was from inception to March 1st
2021, with human papillomavirus, rupture, pregnancy, preterm birth, viral
infection, and pregnancy complications as search terms. RevMan5.3 provided by the
Cochrane Collaboration was used to perform bias risk assessment.
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies were identified, involving 45,603 patients,
including 22,799 cases in the control group, and 22,799 cases in an HPV infection
group. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to
express the results. HPV infection increased the probability of premature
delivery (OR =1.81, 95% CI: 1.25-2.62, Z=3.16, P=0.002) and PROM (OR =1.74, 95%
CI: 1.45-2.10, Z=5.84, P<0.00001). The P values were all less than 0.05, and the 
difference was statistically significant.
DISCUSSION: A total of 7 articles were included in this meta-analysis. HPV
infection affects the physiology of pregnant women and may lead to PROM and
premature delivery.
