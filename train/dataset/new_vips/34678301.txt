Quantification of viral replication underlies investigations into host-virus
interactions. In Drosophila melanogaster, persistent infections with Drosophila C
virus, Drosophila A virus, and Nora virus are commonly observed in nature and in 
laboratory fly stocks. However, traditional endpoint dilution assays to quantify 
infectious titers are not compatible with persistently infecting isolates of
these viruses that do not cause cytopathic effects in cell culture. Here we
present a novel assay based on immunological detection of Drosophila C virus
infection that allows quantification of infectious titers for a wider range of
Drosophila C virus isolates. We also describe strand specific RT-qPCR assays for 
quantification of viral negative strand RNA produced during Drosophila C virus,
Drosophila A virus, and Nora virus infection. Finally, we demonstrate the utility
of these assays for quantification of viral replication during oral infections
and persistent infections with each virus.
