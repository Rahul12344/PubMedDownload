INTRODUCTION: The greatest enemy of a global pandemic is not the virus itself,
but the fear, rumor, and stigma that envelopes people. This article explores the 
context and history of fear and stigma relating to pandemic, summarizing key
actions to mitigate the harms during an active pandemic.
METHOD: Our article draws from accounts in literature and journalist accounts
documenting the relationship between infectious diseases and major disease
outbreaks that have garnered fear and stigmatization.
RESULTS: Fear, stigma, and discrimination are not new concepts for pandemics.
These social effects run the risk of diverting attention from the presenting
disease and government responses. Reactions to fear, stigma, and discrimination
risk sabotaging effective efforts to contain, manage, and eradicate the disease.
CONCLUSION: Emergency managers have an important role in dispelling myths,
disseminating appropriate and evidence-based information without exacerbating
fears. Knowledge about the roots of fear and bias along with a good understanding
of historical plagues and pandemics is vital to ensure those in the field of
emergency management can effectively manage irrational fears.
