SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent at the root of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
harbors a large RNA genome from which a tiered ensemble of subgenomic RNAs
(sgRNAs) is generated. Comprehensive definition and investigation of these RNA
products are important for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. This review
summarizes the recent progress on SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA identification,
characterization, and application as a viral replication marker. The significance
of these findings and potential future research areas of interest are discussed.
