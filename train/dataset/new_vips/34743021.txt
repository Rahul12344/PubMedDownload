INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Espírito Santo state is considered a region with a
higher frequency of hepatitis B virus infection. This study characterized
demographic, epidemiological, laboratory, virological and clinical aspects of 587
chronic HBV carriers followed up at the University of Espírito Santo Hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic, epidemiological, laboratory and clinical data
were extracted from medical records during the entire follow-up period.
Classification of the evolutionary phases of chronic hepatitis B was defined as
immunotolerant; inactive carrier; chronic active hepatitis HBeAg (+)  and HBeAg
(-). Characterization of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes was performed by sequencing
of overlapping surface antigens and HBV DNA polymerase genes. Phylogenetic
relationships were determined using BEAST 1.8.3 software.
RESULTS: and Conclusions: Genotypes found were A (132/65.3%) [A1 = 129 (63.9%)
and A2 = 3 (1.5%)], D (66/32.7%) [D3 = 56 (27.7%), D4 = 8 (4.0%) and D2 = 2
(1.0%)] and F (4/2.0%) - all F2a. Subgenotypes A1 or D3 were not associated with 
age, sex, HIV/HCV co-infection, viral load, antiviral usage, HBeAg status or
clinical stages of chronic hepatitis B. Mother -to-child-transmission (MTCT) was 
associated with the subgenotype A1 and intrafamilial transmission with
subgenotype D3. Subgenotype A1 was more frequent than D3 among individuals born
outside ES compared to those born in ES.
CONCLUSIONS: The most predominant clinical phases were HBeAg (-), inactive
carrier and chronic active hepatitis HBeAg (-). Subgenotypes A1 and D3 were most 
frequent and were associated were MTCT and intrafamilial transmission of HBV,
respectively.
