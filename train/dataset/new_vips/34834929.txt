Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a neglected arthropod-borne virus found in the Americas.
MAYV infection results in Mayaro fever, a non-lethal debilitating disease
characterized by a strong inflammatory response affecting the joints and muscles.
MAYV was once considered endemic to forested areas in Brazil but has managed to
adapt and spread to urban regions using new vectors, such as Aedes aegypti, and
has the potential to cause serious epidemics in the future. Currently, there are 
no vaccines or specific treatments against MAYV. In this study, the antiviral
activity of a series of synthetic cyclic ketones were evaluated for the first
time against MAYV. Twenty-four compounds were screened in a cell viability assay,
and eight were selected for further evaluation. Effective concentration (EC50)
and selectivity index (SI) were calculated and compound
9-(5-(4-chlorophenyl]furan-2-yl)-3,6-dimethyl-3,4,5,6,7,9-hexahydro-1H-xanthene-1
,8(2))-dione (9) (EC50 = 21.5 µmol·L-1, SI = 15.8) was selected for mechanism of 
action assays. The substance was able to reduce viral activity by approximately
70% in both pre-treatment and post-treatment assays.
