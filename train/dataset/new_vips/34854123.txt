Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an intermediate vascular sarcoma that can cause
significant morbidity and mortality in patients if left untreated. It is
associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. Definitive diagnosis is
supported by classic histology including slit-like vascular spaces, spindle
cells, lymphocyte infiltration, and extravasated RBCs on hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) stain and positive immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HHV-8. We present
a challenge we encountered in detecting HHV-8 by IHC in a mucosal lesion
demonstrating classic histology for KS. This article is protected by copyright.
