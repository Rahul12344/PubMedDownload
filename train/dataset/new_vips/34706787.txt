The severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) delta variant is
highly transmissible, and current vaccines may have reduced effectiveness in
preventing symptomatic infection. Using epidemiological and genomic analyses, we 
investigated an outbreak of the variant in an acute-care setting among partially 
and fully vaccinated individuals. Effective outbreak control was achieved using
standard measures.
