BACKGROUND: Occupational blood exposure is one of the major public health
problems that healthcare workers (HCWs) are encountering. Most previous
occupational blood exposure studies are delimited to needle stick injury, which
could underestimate the real level of blood exposure. On the other hand, others
deal with crude blood and body-fluids exposure, which possibly overestimate the
magnitude of blood exposure. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the
prevalence of occupational blood exposure and identifying associated factors
among HCWs in the Southern Tigrai zone governmental hospitals of Northern
Ethiopia considering all the potential means of blood exposure (needle stick
injury, sharp medical equipment injury, and blood splash) while excluding
blood-free body-fluids.
METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study design was employed to gather
data from randomly selected HCWs in three governmental hospitals from February to
March, 2020. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the
independent factors associated with the outcome variable.
RESULTS: From the total of 318 HCWs, 148 (46.5 %) were exposed to blood at least 
once in their lifetime. Working for more than 40 h per week (AOR= 9.4; 95 % CI:
7.61, 11.41), lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (AOR=3.88;
95 % CI: 1.64, 5.42), Hepatitis B virus vaccination (AOR=0.54; 95 % CI:
0.12,0.78), recapping used needle sticks (AOR=3.18; 95 % CI: 1.28, 8.83), and
lack of infection prevention and patient safety (IPPS) training (AOR=13.5; 95 %
CI: 8.12,19.11) were detected to significantly increase the likelihood of
occupational blood exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: As nearly half of the HCWs were exposed to blood, reducing work load
below 40 h per week by employing additional staff members, supplying adequate
PPE, avoiding recapping of used needle sticks, and providing IPPS training for
the HCWs should be practiced.
