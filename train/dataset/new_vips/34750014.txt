COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the public health and social economy
worldwide. A safe, effective, and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2
infections/diseases is urgently needed. We have been developing a recombinant
vaccine based on a prefusion-stabilized spike trimer of SARS-CoV-2 and formulated
with aluminium hydroxide and CpG 7909. The spike protein was expressed in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, purified, and prepared as a stable formulation with
the dual adjuvant. Immunogenicity studies showed that candidate vaccines elicited
robust neutralizing antibody responses and substantial CD4+ T cell responses in
both mice and non-human primates. And vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies
persisted at high level for at least 6 months. Challenge studies demonstrated
that candidate vaccine reduced the viral loads and inflammation in the lungs of
SARS-CoV-2 infected golden Syrian hamsters significantly. In addition, the
vaccine-induced antibodies showed cross-neutralization activity against B.1.1.7
and B.1.351 variants. These data suggest candidate vaccine is efficacious in
preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated pneumonia, thereby justifying
ongoing phase I/II clinical studies in China (NCT04982068 and NCT04990544).
