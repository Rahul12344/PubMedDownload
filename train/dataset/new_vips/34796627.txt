The COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety in society and particularly in
healthcare workers, as shown with a questionnaire in our centre at the beginning 
of the pandemic. In this collaborative study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of
the pandemic on anxiety 1 year later by applying the same questionnaire to the
physicians working in the same department. A total of 77 participants consented
to the study. The median age was 28 (interquartile range = 4) years and 55.8%
were male. As in the first survey, female gender, having family members over
65 years of age, and having family members with chronic diseases were
significantly associated with high anxiety scores and levels. There were no
statistically significant differences between the first and second survey
participants in any of the anxiety scales, which means anxiety persists.
