Pegivirus, HPgV, earlier known as Gb virus and hepatitis G virus, is an
enveloped, positive-stranded RNA and lymphotropic virus classified into the
Flaviviridae family. The transmission routes primarily involve blood products,
with infections worldwide, leading up to 25% of persistent infections. To date,
no effective therapeutic means are available to resolve Pegivirus infections.
Effective vaccine therapeutics are the best alternative to manage this disease
and any associated potential pandemic. Thus, whole proteome-based mining of
immunogenic peptides, i.e., CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), HTL (helper T
lymphocytes) and B cell epitopes were mapped to design a vaccine ensemble. Our
investigation revealed that 29 different epitopes impart a critical role in
immune response induction, which was also validated by exploring its
physiochemical properties and experimental feasibility. In silico expression and 
host immune simulation using an agent-based modeling approach confirmed the
induction of both primary and secondary immune factors such as IL, cytokines and 
antibodies. The current study warrants further lab experiments to demonstrate its
efficacy and safety.
