A novel human coronavirus prompted considerable worry at the end of the year
2019. Now, it represents a significant global health and economic burden. The
newly emerged coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the primary reason for the COVID-19 global
pandemic. According to recent global figures, COVID-19 has caused approximately
243.3 million illnesses and 4.9 million deaths. Several human cell receptors are 
involved in the virus identification of the host cells and entering them. Hence, 
understanding how the virus binds to host-cell receptors is crucial for
developing antiviral treatments and vaccines. The current work aimed to determine
the multiple host-cell receptors that bind with SARS-CoV-2 and other human
coronaviruses for the purpose of cell entry. Extensive research is needed using
neutralizing antibodies, natural chemicals, and therapeutic peptides to target
those host-cell receptors in extremely susceptible individuals. More research is 
needed to map SARS-CoV-2 cell entry pathways in order to identify potential viral
inhibitors.
