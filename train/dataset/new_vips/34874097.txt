BACKGROUND: Virus inactivation is a critical operation in therapeutic protein
manufacturing. Low pH buffers are a widely used strategy to ensure robust
enveloped virus clearance. However, the choice of model virus can give varying
results in viral clearance studies. Pseudorabies virus (SuHV) or herpes simplex
virus-1 (HSV-1) are frequently chosen as model virus to demonstrate the
inactivation for the herpes family.
RESULTS: In this study, SuHV, HSV-1, and equine arteritis virus (EAV) were used
to compare the inactivation susceptibility at pH 4.0 and 4°C. SuHV and HSV-1 are 
from the same family, and EAV was chosen as a small, enveloped virus. Glycine,
acetate, and citrate buffers at pH 4.0 and varying buffer strengths were studied.
The inactivation susceptibility was found to be in the order of SuHV > HSV > EAV.
The buffer effectiveness was found to be in the order of
citrate > acetate > glycine. The smaller virus, EAV, remained stable and
infectious in all the buffer types and compositions studied.
CONCLUSION: The variation in inactivation susceptibility of herpes viruses
indicated that SuHV and HSV cannot be interchangeably used as a virus model for
inactivation studies. Smaller viruses might remain adventitiously infective at
moderately low pH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
