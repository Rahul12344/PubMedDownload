Community health workers play an instrumental role in the health care system and 
are critical partners in pandemic response. In Hawai'i, community health workers 
are working to reduce the burden of chronic disease among Pacific Islander,
Filipino, and Native Hawaiian populations in partnership with government agencies
and health care organizations. This commentary reviews the role community health 
workers in Hawai'i are playing in assisting with the COVID-19 response. Utilizing
their skills and the community's trust, they are optimally positioned to reach
marginalized and vulnerable populations hit hardest by COVID-19; community health
workers educate, screen, and provide social service referrals to community
members.
