The aim of this study was to verify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the seminal
sample of men during the acute phase of COVID-19. A prospective study was
performed with inclusion of twenty-two men diagnosed with COVID-19 through RT-PCR
from pharyngeal smear samples and who were in the acute phase of infection. These
men were evaluated regarding medical history and physical examination.
Furthermore, seminal samples of each men were collected 7, 14 and 21 days after
the infection was confirmed. The sample were used for seminal analysis, as well
as for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR technique. In addition, cell
culture was performed with subsequent repetition of the analysis of viral
presence. None of the semen samples collected was positive for the detection of
the virus that causes COVID-19. Most of the men evaluated had a mild condition
and the loss of smell was the most frequent symptom. There were no significant
changes in seminal parameters within the period of study. Based on our pilot
data, patients with a mild form of COVID-19 in the acute stage of the disease are
unlikely to have SARS-CoV-2 in semen.
