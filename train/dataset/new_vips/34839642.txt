OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effects of the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic on sexual functions and behavior in men with heterosexual
partners.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 602 participants completed an online
questionnaire, shared via social networks, between November 20 and December 20,
2020. Pre-pandemic sexual intercourse frequency, International Erectile
Dysfunction Index (IIEF-15) score, intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), 
premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) score, and activities during sexual 
intercourse were compared to the ones during the pandemic. In addition, the
effects of various variables on participants' sexual functions were evaluated and
analyzed according to age groups.
RESULTS: The mean number of weekly sexual intercourse during the pandemic was
1.7+1.7, which was significantly lower than in the pre-pandemic period (p <
0.001). The ED score was significantly lower during the pandemic (p < 0.001)
compared to the pre-pandemic period, however orgasmic function (p = 0.016),
sexual intercourse satisfaction (p < 0.001), general satisfaction (p < 0.001),
and PEDT scores (p = 0.004) were significantly higher. There was no significant
difference in IELT before and during the pandemic (p = 0.391). Full-time
employment and low education level were risk factors for developing ED and PE.
The negative affect of the pandemic on sexual life was most prominent in the > 65
age group. Although kissing, oral and anal sex, and face-to-face sex positions
decreased during the pandemic in all age groups, kissing and face-to-face sex
positions remained the most preferred sexual behavior pattern (p = 0.002). There 
was no reduction in risky sexual behavior in the majority of the participants.
CONCLUSIONS: At the end of one year with COVID-19, a decrease in erectile
function and an increase in PE incidence were observed in men. Despite this,
there was an increase in sexual desire and satisfaction. Although there were some
changes in sexual behavior, the majority of pre-pandemic habits continued.
