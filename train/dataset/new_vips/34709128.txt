The Georgia-07-like genotype II African swine fever virus (ASFV) with high
virulence has been prevalent in China since 2018. Here, we report that genotype I
ASFVs have now also emerged in China. Two non-haemadsorbing genotype I ASFVs,
HeN/ZZ-P1/21 and SD/DY-I/21, were isolated from pig farms in Henan and Shandong
province, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequences
suggested that both isolates share high similarity with NH/P68 and OURT88/3, two 
genotype I ASFVs isolated in Portugal in the last century. Animal challenge
testing revealed that SD/DY-I/21 shows low virulence and efficient
transmissibility in pigs, and causes mild onset of infection and chronic disease.
SD/DY-I/21 was found to cause necrotic skin lesions and joint swelling. The
emergence of genotype I ASFVs will present more problems and challenges for the
control and prevention of African swine fever in China.
