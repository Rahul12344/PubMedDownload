Myelitis, including longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LTEM), is
reported in more than forty patients after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Among COVID-19 vaccines, only Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) has
been associated with few cases of myelitis (1 LTEM). We report the first case of 
myelitis/LTEM after BBIBP-CorV/Sinopharm vaccine, interestingly presented as a
hemicord syndrome. A 71-year-old male presented with left-side diplegia,
right-side hemihyposthesis with facial sparing and impaired position sensation in
left foot after vaccination with BBIBP-CorV. MRI revealed a longitudinal signal
in left cervical hemicord. This is the first reported myelitis and LTEM with
COVID-19 vaccines other than AZD1222.
