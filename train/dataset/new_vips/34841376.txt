The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the death of over half a million Americans,
leaving in its wake widespread grief and despair. Using national survey data
(n ​= ​1998) and a treatment-weighting strategy, this study examines how COVID-19
bereavement associates with depressive symptoms and binge drinking. After
adjustment for non-random exposure to COVID-19 bereavement, I find that
respondents who have lost someone close to them to the virus report greater
depressive symptomology and more frequent binge drinking. Among essential
workers, the loss of a close tie to COVID-19 exacerbates these associations, with
bereavement posing stronger effects for depressive symptoms and binge drinking
for members of this group. The implications of these findings for the long-term
mental health of the bereaved and those most vulnerable to the virus are
discussed.
