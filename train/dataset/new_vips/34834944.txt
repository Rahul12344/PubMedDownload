Systemic symptoms have often been observed in patients with coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) in addition to pneumonia, however, the details are still unclear 
due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. In this study, we investigated
and compared blood coagulation abnormalities and tissue damage between male
Syrian hamsters of 9 (young) and over 36 (aged) weeks old after intranasal
infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Despite similar levels of viral replication and inflammatory responses in the
lungs of both age groups, aged but not young hamsters showed significant
prolongation of prothrombin time and prominent acute kidney damage. Moreover,
aged hamsters demonstrated increased intravascular coagulation time-dependently
in the lungs, suggesting that consumption of coagulation factors causes
prothrombin time prolongation. Furthermore, proximal urinary tract damage and
mesangial matrix expansion were observed in the kidneys of the aged hamsters at
early and later disease stages, respectively. Given that the severity and
mortality of COVID-19 are higher in elderly human patients, the effect of aging
on pathogenesis needs to be understood and should be considered for the selection
of animal models. We, thus, propose that the aged hamster is a good small animal 
model for COVID-19 research.
