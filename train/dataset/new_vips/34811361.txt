The main (Mpro) and papain-like (PLpro) proteases encoded by SARS-CoV-2 are
essential to process viral polyproteins into functional units, thus representing 
key targets for anti-viral drug development. There is a need for an efficient
inhibitor screening system that can identify drug candidates in a cellular
context. Here we describe modular, tunable autoproteolytic gene switches (TAGS)
relying on synthetic transcription factors that self-inactivate, unless in the
presence of coronavirus protease inhibitors, consequently activating transgene
expression. TAGS rapidly report the impact of drug candidates on Mpro and PLpro
activities with a high signal-to-noise response and a sensitivity matching
concentration ranges inhibiting viral replication. The modularity of the TAGS
enabled the study of other Coronaviridae proteases, characterization of mutations
and multiplexing of gene switches in human cells. Mice implanted with Mpro or
PLpro TAGS-engineered cells enabled analysis of the activity and bioavailability 
of protease inhibitors in vivo in a virus-free setting.
