Testing is crucial in controlling COVID-19. The Procleix® SARS-CoV-2 assay, a
transcription-mediated amplification nucleic acid test that runs on an automated 
system, was evaluated using inactivated virus and clinical samples. The
sensitivity of the assay was assessed using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and
compared to 3 other tests. Clinical validation utilized 2 sets of samples: (1)
Nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples (n = 963) from asymptomatic
individuals, and (2) nasopharyngeal samples from symptomatic patients: 100
positive and 100 negative by RT-PCR. The Procleix assay had greater sensitivity
(3-fold to 100-fold) than the comparators and had high specificity (100%) in
asymptomatic subjects. In symptomatic patients, the Procleix assay detected 100% 
of PCR-positives and found 24 positives in the initial PCR-negatives. Eighteen of
these were confirmed positive and 6 were inconclusive. These studies showed that 
the Procleix SARS-CoV-2 assay was a sensitive and specific tool for detecting
COVID-19.
