The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays crucial role in virus life cycle by
replicating the viral genome. The SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that rapidly spread 
worldwide and acquired mutations. This study was carried out to identify
mutations in RdRp as the SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. We compared 50217 RdRp
sequences reported from India with the first reported RdRp sequence from Wuhan,
China to identify 223 mutations acquired among Indian isolates. Our protein
modelling study revealed that several mutants can potentially alter stability and
flexibility of RdRp. We predicted the potential B cell epitopes contributed by
RdRp and identified thirty-six linear continuous and twenty-five discontinuous
epitopes. Among 223 RdRp mutants, 44% of them localises in the B cell epitopes
region. Altogether, this study highlights the need to identify and characterize
the variations in RdRp to understand the impact of these mutations on SARS-CoV-2.
