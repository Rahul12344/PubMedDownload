INTRODUCTION: A small percentage of patients will develop a severe form of
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, it is important to predict the
potential outcomes identifying early markers of poor prognosis. In this context, 
we evaluated the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lipid abnormalities and
their role in prognosis.
METHODS: Single-center, retrospective, observational study of COVID-19 patients
admitted from March to October 2020. Clinical and laboratory data, comorbidities,
and treatments for COVID-19 were evaluated. Main outcomes including intensive
care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were analyzed with a multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression model.
RESULTS: We selected 1489 from a total of 2038 consecutive patients with
confirmed COVID-19, who had a complete lipid profile before ICU admission. During
the follow-up performed in 1109 patients, we observed a decrease in T-c, HDL-c,
and LDL-c in 28.6%, 42.9%, and 30.4% of patients, respectively, and an increase
in TG in 76.8%. The decrease of both T-c and HDL- c was correlated with a
decrease in albumin levels (r = 0.39 and r = 0.37, respectively). Kaplan-Meier
survival curves found an increased ICU admission in patients with lower T-c (HR
0.55, CI 0.36-0.86), HDL-c (HR 0.61, CI 0.45-0.84), and LDL-c (HR 0.85, CI
0.74-0.97). Higher values of T-c (HR 0.45, CI 0.36-0.57), HDL-c (HR 0.66, CI
0.54-0.81), and LDL-c (HR 0.86, CI 0.78-0.94) showed a protective effect on
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in lipid profile are a frequent complication of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and might be related to morbidity and mortality.
