Peruvian households have experienced one of the most prevalent economic shocks
due to COVID-19, significantly increasing their vulnerability to food insecurity 
(FI). To understand the vulnerability characteristics of these households among
the Peruvian young population, including the role of the government's response
through emergency cash transfer, we analysed longitudinal data from the Young
Lives study (n = 2026), a study that follows the livelihoods of two birth cohorts
currently aged 18 to 27 years old. FI was assessed using the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale. Household characteristics were collected before and during the 
COVID-19 outbreak in Peru to characterise participants' vulnerability to FI.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between
government support and participants' vulnerability characteristics to FI. During 
the period under study (March to December 2020), 24% (95% CI: 22.1-25.9%) of the 
participants experienced FI. Families in the top wealth tercile were 49% less
likely to experience FI. Larger families (>5 members) and those with increased
household expenses and decreased income due to COVID-19 were more likely to
experience FI (by 35%, 39% and 42%, respectively). There was no significant
association between government support and FI (p = 0.768). We conclude that
pre-pandemic socioeconomic status, family size, and the economic disruption
during COVID-19 contribute to the risk of FI among the Peruvian young population,
while government support insufficiently curtailed the risk to these households.
