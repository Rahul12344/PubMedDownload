Circulating memory CD8 T cell trafficking and protective capacity during
liver-stage malaria infection remains undefined. We find that effector memory CD8
T cells (Tem) infiltrate the liver within 6 hours after malarial or bacterial
infections and mediate pathogen clearance. Tem recruitment coincides with rapid
transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory genes in Plasmodium-infected livers.
Recruitment requires CD8 T cell-intrinsic LFA-1 expression and the presence of
liver phagocytes. Rapid Tem liver infiltration is distinct from recruitment to
other non-lymphoid tissues in that it occurs both in the absence of liver tissue 
resident memory "sensing-and-alarm" function and ∼42 hours earlier than in lung
infection by influenza virus. These data demonstrate relevance for Tem in
protection against malaria and provide generalizable mechanistic insights germane
to control of liver infections.
