OBJECTIVE: Pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have a high risk
of contagiousness, as they usually progress with asymptomatic or mild respiratory
symptoms. Disorder in taste and/or smell has rarely been reported in pediatric
cases. In our study, early diagnosis and isolation measures were emphasized by
evaluating the clinical, laboratory, and radiological imaging findings of
pediatric COVID-19 cases presenting with symptoms of taste and/or smell disorder.
METHODS: Seven cases aged 0-18 years were included in the study. The severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test was performed
for the seven cases presented with taste and/or smell disorders. Clinical
findings, laboratory tests, and radiological imaging of all the cases were
evaluated on the day of admission and on the fifth day.
RESULTS: Seven (5.7%) of 122 pediatric COVID-19 cases had disorder in taste
and/or smell. In two cases, pneumonia findings were detected in thorax computed
tomography imaging. It was observed that all the patients fully recovered at the 
latest on the 21st day. In the cranial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of a 
case, diffusion restriction was detected in the corpus callosum splenium.
CONCLUSION: Although less common than adults, children with COVID-19 may also
have taste and smell disorders, and this may be accompanied by central nervous
system imaging findings.
