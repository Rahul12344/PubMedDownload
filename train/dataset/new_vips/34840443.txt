We present two patients who turned positive for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) after elective cardiac surgery, developing postoperative pericardial
effusion with tamponade. One of the patients who presented with tamponade had no 
other symptoms of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 can rarely present with cardiac
manifestations including pericardial effusion and tamponade. In the post cardiac 
surgery setting, this effect of the virus may be accentuated. Hence, a high index
of suspicion and prompt management are the keys for a successful outcome.
