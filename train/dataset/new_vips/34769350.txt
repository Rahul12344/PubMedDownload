The 2019 novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is
causing a global pandemic. The virus primarily affects the upper and lower
respiratory tracts and raises the risk of a variety of non-pulmonary
consequences, the most severe and possibly fatal of which are cardiovascular
problems. Data show that almost one-third of the patients with a moderate or
severe form of COVID-19 had preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities such as
diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, heart failure, or coronary artery
disease. SARS-CoV2 causes hyper inflammation, hypoxia, apoptosis, and a
renin-angiotensin system imbalance in a variety of cell types, primarily
endothelial cells. Profound endothelial dysfunction associated with COVID-19 can 
be the cause of impaired organ perfusion that may generate acute myocardial
injury, renal failure, and a procoagulant state resulting in thromboembolic
events. We discuss the most recent results on the involvement of endothelial
dysfunction in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in patients with cardiometabolic
diseases in this review. We also provide insights on treatments that may reduce
the severity of this viral infection.
