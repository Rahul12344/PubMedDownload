One major warning emerging during the first worldwide combat against
healthcare-associated infections concerns the key role of the surface in the
storage and transfer of the virus. Our study is based on the laser coating of
surfaces with an inorganic/organic composite mixture of amorphous calcium
phosphate-chitosan-tetracycline that is able to fight against infectious agents, 
but also capable of preserving its activity for a prolonged time, up to several
days. The extended release in simulated fluids of the composite mixture
containing the drug (tetracycline) was demonstrated by mass loss and UV-VIS
investigations. The drug release profile from our composite coatings proceeds via
two stages: an initial burst release (during the first hours), followed by a
slower evolution active for the next 72 h, and probably more. Optimized coatings 
strongly inhibit the growth of tested bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and
Escherichia coli), while the drug incorporation has no impact on the in vitro
composite's cytotoxicity, the coatings proving an excellent biocompatibility
sustaining the normal development of MG63 bone-like cells. One may, therefore,
consider that the proposed coatings' composition can open the prospective of a
new generation of antimicrobial coatings for implants, but also for nosocomial
and other large area contamination prevention.
