The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious threat to public health worldwide
and, to date, no effective treatment is available. Thus, we herein review the
pharmaceutical approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Numerous candidate
medicines that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication have been
proposed. These medicines include inhibitors of serine protease TMPRSS2 and
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 
receptor in host cells. ACE2 inhibitors block TMPRSS2 and S protein priming, thus
preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells. Moreover, antiviral medicines
(including the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, the HIV protease inhibitors
lopinavir and ritonavir, and wide-spectrum antiviral antibiotics arbidol and
favipiravir) have been shown to reduce the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 as well as
morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.
