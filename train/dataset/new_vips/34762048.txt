Infections with Flaviviridae constitute a major public health concern, especially
considering the limited availability of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. 
Most notably, the recent emergence of Zika virus in the Americas was associated
with the dramatic increase of severe symptoms such as congenital microcephaly,
while hepatitis C virus causes the death of approximately 300,000 individuals
annually. Flaviviridae have evolved to hijack cellular organelles and to favor
their replication, often by divergent molecular mechanisms. In addition to the
remodeling of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is required for the replication of
the viral genome and the assembly of the neosynthetized virions, Flaviviridae
induce drastic morphological alterations of the mitochondria. This is associated 
with the viral co-opting of several key mitochondrial functions in apoptosis,
innate immunity and metabolism. This review recapitulates the current knowledge
about the morphological and functional relationship between Flaviviridae and
mitochondria and explains how this contributes to the establishment of a
cytoplasmic environment which is favorable to viral replication.
