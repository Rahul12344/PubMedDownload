BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health systems worldwide since
2020. At the frontline of the pandemic, healthcare workers are at high risk of
exposure. Compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) should be
encouraged at the frontline. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects
of dissemination interventions to improve healthcare workers' adherence with IPC 
guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases in the workplace.
METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study
Register. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs that
assessed the effect of any dissemination strategy in any healthcare settings.
Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. We synthesized data 
using random-effects model meta-analysis in Stata 14.2.
RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs conducted from 2004 to 2020 with over 65,370
healthcare workers. Adherence to IPC guidelines was assessed by influenza
vaccination uptake, hand hygiene compliance, and knowledge on IPC. The most
assessed intervention was educational material in combined strategies (plus
educational meetings, local opinion leaders, audit and feedback, reminders,
tailored interventions, monitoring the performance of the delivery of health
care, educational games, and/or patient-mediated interventions). Combined
dissemination strategies compared to usual routine improve vaccination uptake
(risk ratio [RR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54 to 1.81,
moderate-certainty evidence), and may improve hand hygiene compliance (RR 1.70;
95% CI 1.03 to 2.83, moderate-certainty). When compared to single strategies,
combined dissemination strategies probably had no effect on vaccination uptake
(RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07, low-certainty), and hand hygiene compliance (RR
1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.36, low-certainty). Knowledge of healthcare workers on IPC
improved when combined dissemination strategies were compared with usual
activities, and the effect was uncertain in comparison to single strategy (very
low-certainty evidence).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined dissemination strategies increased workers' vaccination
uptake, hand hygiene compliance, and knowledge on IPC in comparison to usual
activities. The effect was negligible when compared to single dissemination
strategies. The adoption of dissemination strategies in a planned and targeted
way for healthcare workers may increase adherence to IPC guidelines and thus
prevent dissemination of infectious disease in the workplace.
