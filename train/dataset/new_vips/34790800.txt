Background: Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) inhibitor is commonly used to treat
depression, but side effects seriously decrease its efficacy. PDE4D was a
downstream target mRNA of miR-139-5p. Therefore, we examined the effects of
hippocampal miR-139-5p gain- and loss-of-function on depression-like behaviors,
the expression level of PDE4D, and hippocampus neurogenesis.
Methods: Bioinformatic analyses were carried out to to screen differential genes.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and luciferase
reporter assay were used to confirm the relationship between miR-139-5p and
PDE4D. MiR-139-5p mimics, miR-139-5p inhibitor, or miR-NC were used to explore
the function of miR-139-5p in HT-22 cells. We further explored the role of
miR-139-5p in vivo using AAV-injection. Elisa, western blotting, and fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect the expression of miR-139-5p and
PDE4D in CRC tissues.
Results: Here, we showed that PDE4D messenger RNA (mRNA) was a direct target of
microRNA (miR)-139-5p, which was downregulated in a chronic ultra-mild stress
(CUMS)-induced depression mouse model. Moreover, in experiments in vitro,
miR-139-5p mimic repressed PDE4D expression in HT-22 cells, but promoted
phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Interestingly,
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-miR-139-5p downregulated susceptibility to
stress-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. AAV-miR-139-5p suppressed PDE4D
in mouse hippocampal cells, increasing expression level of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP), p-CREB, and BDNF, and stimulating mouse hippocampal
neurogenesis.
Conclusions: Our findings suggested that miR-139-5p acted like an antidepressant 
by targeting PDE4D, thereby regulating the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB/BDNF 
pathway to improve depression.
