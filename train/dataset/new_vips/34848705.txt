The early diagnosis of active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a
significant barrier to the treatment of the disease and to preventing the
associated significant morbidity and mortality seen, worldwide. Current testing
is delayed due to the high cost, long turnaround times and high expertise needed 
in centralised diagnostic laboratories. Here we demonstrate a user-friendly,
low-cost pan-genotypic assay, based upon reverse transcriptase loop mediated
isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). We developed a prototype device for
point-of-care use, comprising a LAMP amplification chamber and lateral flow
nucleic acid detection strips, giving a visually-read, user-friendly result in
<40 min. The developed assay fulfils the current guidelines recommended by World 
Health Organisation and is manufactured at minimal cost using simple, portable
equipment. Further development of the diagnostic test will facilitate linkage
between disease diagnosis and treatment, greatly improving patient care pathways 
and reducing loss to follow-up, so assisting in the global elimination strategy.
