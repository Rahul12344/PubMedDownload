BACKGROUND: During the 2014-15 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic, thousands of
people in Sierra Leone were infected with the devastating virus and survived.
Years after the epidemic was declared over, stigma toward EVD survivors and
others affected by the virus is still a major concern, but little is known about 
the factors that influence stigma toward survivors. This study examines how key
personal and ecological factors predicted EVD-related stigma at the height of the
2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone, and the personal and ecological factors that 
shaped changes in stigma over time.
METHODS: Using three waves of survey data from a representative sample in the
Western Urban and Western Rural districts of Sierra Leone, this study examines
factors associated with self-reported personal stigma toward Ebola survivors (11 
items, α = 0.77) among 1008 adults (74.6% retention rate) from 63 census
enumeration areas of the Western Rural and Western Urban districts of Sierra
Leone. Participants were randomly sampled at the height of the EVD epidemic and
followed up as the epidemic was waning and once the epidemic had been declared
over by the WHO. Three-level mixed effects models were fit using Stata 16 SE to
examine cross-sectional associations as well as predictors of longitudinal
changes in stigma toward EVD survivors.
RESULTS: At the height of the EVD epidemic, female sex, household wealth,
post-traumatic stress, EVD-related fear and perceived infection risk are a few of
the factors which predicted higher levels of stigma toward survivors. On average,
stigma toward EVD survivors decreased significantly as the epidemic declined in
Sierra Leone, but female sex, EVD fear, and risk perceptions predicted a slower
rate of change.
CONCLUSION: This study identified key individual and psychosocial characteristics
which may predict higher levels of stigma toward infectious disease survivors.
Future studies should pursue a better understanding of how personal
characteristics and perceptions, including psychosocial distress, fear, and
perceived infection risk serve as pathways for stigma in communities affected by 
infectious disease.
