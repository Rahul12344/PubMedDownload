Covid-19 pandemic is a novel disease with gradual emergence of its signs and
symptoms. Oral healthcare providers had a setback in their dental practices due
to the high rate of infectivity and the risk of contracting the disease through
the patients carrying the virus. Once the dental practice resumed to its normalcy
the dental surgeons came across a variety of oral manifestations in patients with
a history of Covid and post recovery. An attempt is made to recognise the
Covid-19 oral manifestations with plausible explanation of the mechanism of
development of such oral signs.
