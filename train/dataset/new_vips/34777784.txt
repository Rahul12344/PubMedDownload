Background: Methamphetamine (METH), a potent addictive psychostimulant, is highly
prevalent in HIV-infected individuals. Clinically, METH use is implicated in
alteration of immune system and increase of HIV spread/replication. Therefore, it
is of importance to examine whether METH has direct effect on HIV infection of
monocytes, the major target and reservoir cells for the virus.
Results: METH-treated monocytes were more susceptible to HIV infection as
evidenced by increased levels of viral proteins (p24 and Pr55Gag) and expression 
of viral GAG gene. In addition, using HIV Bal with luciferase reporter gene (HIV 
Bal-eLuc), we showed that METH-treated cells expressed higher luciferase
activities than untreated monocytes. Mechanistically, METH inhibited the
expression of IFN-λ1, IRF7, STAT1, and the antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs: 
OAS2, GBP5, ISG56, Viperin and ISG15). In addition, METH down-regulated the
expression of the HIV restriction microRNAs (miR-28, miR-29a, miR-125b, miR-146a,
miR-155, miR-223, and miR-382).
Conclusions: METH compromises the intracellular anti-HIV immunity and facilitates
HIV replication in primary human monocytes.
