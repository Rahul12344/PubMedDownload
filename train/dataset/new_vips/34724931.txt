BACKGROUND: The efficacy and tolerability of an antiretroviral regimen are
important considerations for selection of HIV-1 infection maintenance therapy.
Abacavir/lamivudine plus rilpivirine (ABC/3TC + RPV) has been shown in
international studies to be effective and well-tolerated in virologically
suppressed individuals. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of
switching to ABC/3TC + RPV as maintenance therapy in virologically suppressed
HIV-1 infected individuals in Singapore.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included individuals who 
were prescribed ABC/3TC + RPV, had HIV-1 viral load (VL) < 50 copies/ml
immediately pre-switch, and had no documented history of resistance mutations or 
virologic failure to any of the components. The follow-up period was
48 ± 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals who
maintained virologic suppression of HIV-1 VL < 50 copies/ml at the end of
follow-up period based on on-treatment analysis. The secondary outcomes were the 
resistance profiles associated with virologic failure, changes in immunologic and
metabolic parameters, and the safety profile of ABC/3TC + RPV.
RESULTS: A total of 222 individuals were included in the study. The primary
outcome was achieved in 197 individuals [88.8%, 95% confidence interval:
83.7-92.4%]. There were 21 individuals (9.5%) who discontinued treatment for
non-virologic reasons. The remaining 4 individuals experienced virologic failure,
of whom, 3 of these individuals had developed emergent antiretroviral resistance 
and had HIV-1 VL > 500 copies/ml at the end of the 48 ± 12 weeks follow-up
period. The remaining individual experienced sustained low level viremia and
subsequently achieved viral suppression without undergoing resistance testing. A 
total of 49 adverse events were observed in 31 out of 222 individuals (14.0%),
which led to 13 individuals discontinuing therapy. Neuropsychiatric adverse
events were most commonly observed (53.1%). A statistically significant increase 
in CD4 was observed (p < 0.01), with a median absolute change of 31 cells/uL
(interquartile range: - 31.50 to 140.75). No significant changes in lipid
profiles were detected.
CONCLUSION: ABC/3TC + RPV is a safe and effective switch option for maintenance
therapy in virologically suppressed HIV-1 individuals with in Singapore.
