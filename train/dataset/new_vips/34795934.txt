Background: Nosocomial outbreaks of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus
[A(H1N1)pdm09] easily develop due to its high transmissibility. This study aimed 
to investigate the clinical impacts of a nosocomial outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09
between 21 January and 17 February 2016.
Methods: Patients who developed influenza-like illness (ILI) more than 48 hours
after hospitalization in the index ward were enrolled as suspected patients,
defined as group A and quarantined. Patients in other wards were defined as group
B. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the origins of the
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes.
Results: After the implementation of an infection control measure bundle, the
outbreak was limited to eight patients with ILIs in group A. Nasal swabs from
seven patients were positive for A(H1N1)pdm09. All the patients recovered after
treatment. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in a patient with bronchiectasis
and Penicillium marneffei infection. Compared to the expected duration of
hospitalization in patients without fever, those with fever had a median 7-day
delay in discharge and a mean excess cost of 3,358 RMB. The four influenza
strains identified were genetically identical to the A/California/115/2015
strain. Six of the 54 patients in group B who underwent bronchoscopy developed
transient fever. These patients were hospitalized in various wards of the
hospital and recovered after a short-term course of empirical antibiotics.
Conclusions: After the implementation of infection control measures, the
nosocomial A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak was rapidly contained; infected patients had a
delay in discharge and excess costs, but no deaths occurred.
