Gag-based virus-like particles (VLPs) have high potential as scaffolds for the
development of chimeric vaccines and delivery strategies. The production of
purified preparations that can be preserved independently from cold chains is
highly desirable to facilitate distribution and access worldwide. In this work, a
nimble purification has been developed, facilitating the production of Gag VLPs. 
Suspension-adapted HEK 293 cells cultured in chemically defined cell culture
media were used to produce the VLPs. A four-step downstream process (DSP)
consisting of membrane filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, polishing, and
lyophilization was developed. The purification of VLPs from other contaminants
such as host cell proteins (HCP), double-stranded DNA, or extracellular vesicles 
(EVs) was confirmed after their DSP. A concentration of 2.2 ± 0.8 × 109 VLPs/mL
in the lyophilized samples was obtained after its storage at room temperature for
two months. Morphology and structural integrity of purified VLPs was assessed by 
cryo-TEM and NTA. Likewise, the purification methodologies proposed here could be
easily scaled up and applied to purify similar enveloped viruses and vesicles.
