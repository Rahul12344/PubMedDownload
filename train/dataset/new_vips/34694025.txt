The rollout of antiretroviral therapy globally has increased life expectancy
across Southern Africa, where 20.6 million people now live with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We aimed to determine the prevalence of age-related
osteoporosis and sarcopenia, and investigate the association between HIV, bone
mineral density (BMD), muscle strength and lean mass, and gait speed. A
cross-sectional community-based study of individuals aged 20-80 years in rural
South Africa collected demographic and clinical data, including HIV status, grip 
strength, gait speed, body composition, and BMD. Sarcopenia was defined by the
European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) guidelines, and 
osteoporosis as BMD T-score ≤ -2.5 (if age ≥50 years). The mean ± standard
deviation (SD) age of 805 black South African participants was 44.6 ± 14.8 years,
547 (68.2%) were female; 34 (13.2%) were men, and 129 (23.6%) women had HIV, with
88% overall taking anti-retroviral therapy. A femoral neck T-score ≤ -2.5, seen
in four of 95 (4.2%) men and 39 of 201 (19.4%) women age ≥50 years, was more
common in women with than without HIV (13/35 [37.1%] versus 26/166 [15.7%];
p = 0.003). Although no participant had confirmed sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia
affected more men than women (30/258 [11.6%] versus 24/547 [4.4%]; p = .001].
Although appendicular lean mass (ALM)/height2 index was lower in both men and
women with HIV, there were no differences in grip strength, gait speed, or
probable sarcopenia by HIV status. Older age, female sex, lower ALM/height2
index, slower gait speed, and HIV infection were all independently associated
with lower femoral neck BMD. In conclusion, osteoporosis rather than sarcopenia
is the common musculoskeletal disease of aging in rural South Africa; older women
with HIV may experience greater bone losses than women without HIV. Findings
raise concerns over future fracture risk in Southern Africa, where HIV clinics
should consider routine bone health assessment, particularly in aging women. ©
