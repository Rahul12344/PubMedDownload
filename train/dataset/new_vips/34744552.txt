Grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) is a globally spreading viral infection that
causes major economic losses by reducing crop yield, plant longevity and berry
quality, with no effective treatment. Grapevine leafroll associated virus-3
(GLRaV-3) is the most severe and prevalent GLD strain. Here, we evaluated the
ability of RNA interference (RNAi), a non-GMO gene-silencing pathway, to treat
GLRaV-3 in infected Cabernet Sauvignon grapevines. We synthesized lipid-modified 
polyethylenimine (lmPEI) as a carrier for long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA,
250-bp-long) that targets RNA polymerase and coat protein genes that are
conserved in the GLRaV-3 genome. Self-assembled dsRNA-lmPEI particles, 220 nm in 
diameter, displayed inner ordered domains spaced 7.3Â±2 nm from one another,
correlating to lmPEI wrapping spirally around the dsRNA. The particles
effectively protected RNA from degradation by ribonucleases, and Europium-loaded 
particles applied to grapevine leaves were detected as far as 60-cm from the
foliar application point. In three field experiments, a single dose of foliar
administration knocked down GLRaV-3 titer, and multiple doses of the treatment
kept the viral titer at baseline and triggered recovery of the vine and berries. 
This study demonstrates RNAi as a promising platform for treating viral diseases 
in agriculture.
