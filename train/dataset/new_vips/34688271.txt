INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to assess the emotional state, the occurrence of
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the quality of life of
adults living in Poland during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: The study was conducted on a group of 700 people aged 18 and over living 
in Poland. An anonymous online questionnaire was used in this cross-sectional
study. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured using the Revised Event 
Impact Scale (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS - 21).
The quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF.
RESULTS: In Poland, a high average level of post-traumatic stress was found as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least the minimum level occurring in all
surveyed people. There was also a high incidence of depression (48.00%), anxiety 
(39.29%), and stress (54.86) in the first phase of the pandemic. The average
level of quality of life in Poland was the lowest for the physical domain and
amounted to 49.56 (SD = 11.71). The standard of living in the psychological
domain was 60.26 (SD = 13.14).
CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic is having a significant impact on human mental health. 
The very high average levels of post-traumatic stress, stress, anxiety, and
depression as well as low quality of life make it necessary to consider
interventions that will favor the use of more adaptive defense mechanisms and
build mental resilience during an infectious disease pandemic and its long-term
consequences.
