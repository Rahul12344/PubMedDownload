In the last few years MMTV-like nucleotide sequences were detected in some feline
and canine mammary tumours. Due to the confirmed role of cats in the epidemiology
of the MMTV-like virus, the aim of this study was to investigate the main
pathological features of positive feline mammary carcinomas (FMCs). Twenty-four
FMCs were collected at the University of Bologna, submitted to laser
microdissection and analysed by nested fluorescence-PCR using primer sets
specific for MMTV env sequence. For immunohistochemistry, an antibody against
MMTV protein 14 (p14) was used. MMTV-like sequences were detected in three out of
24 FMCs (12.5%), one tubular carcinoma, one tubulopapillary carcinoma and one
ductal carcinoma. All PCR-positive tumours were also positive for p14. Multiple
nucleotide alignment has shown similarity to MMTV ranging from 98% to 100%. All
the 102 examined FMCs were submitted to immunohistochemistry for molecular
phenotyping. Of the nine MMTV-like positive FMCs, six were basal-like and three
luminal-like. Our results demonstrate MMTV-like sequences and protein in FMCs of 
different geographic areas. Molecular phenotyping could contribute to understand 
the possible role of MMTV-like virus in FMC tumor biology.
