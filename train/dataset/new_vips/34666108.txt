Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) resistance to current antiviral drugs, that all
target the viral DNA polymerase, represents a growing concern, notably among
immunocompromised patients. Amenamevir, a novel antiviral that inhibits the VZV
helicase-primase (HP) complex, is approved in Japan for the treatment of herpes
zoster. In this study, we describe the low natural polymorphism of VZV HP complex
(interstrain identity >99.7% both at nucleotide and amino acid levels) among 44
VZV clinical isolates. This work enabled to settle the maps of natural
polymorphisms of VZV HP complex and to provide the genotypic tools for the
monitoring of the emergence of VZV resistance to amenamevir in patients.
