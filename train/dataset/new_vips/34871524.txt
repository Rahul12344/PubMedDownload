OBJECTIVES: Corticosteroid is first-line therapy in immune thrombocytopenia.
However, nearly 30% of patients appear in steroid-resistance. Our research
analyses the relevant indicators of patients and develops a risk prediction model
to predict the poor response to steroid-therapy in ITP patients.
METHODS: We collected data from 111 ITP patients admitted to Xiamen University
Zhongshan Hospital from 2013 to 2019 as the training cohort and 65 ITP patients
during 2019-2020 as the external validation cohort. Screening significant
factors(P < 0.05) in univariate analysis, and further identified to be
independent variables in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Incorporated
the significant risk factors in and presented them with a nomogram based on
independent risk predictors. The nomogram was assessed by receiver operating
characteristics curves and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: We constructed a steroid-resistance prediction model based on the
potential predictors including age, serum ferritin and expression of HBsAg. As a 
result, based on the area under the ROC curves, the training cohort (AUC: 0.718, 
95% CI: 0.615-0.821) and the external validation cohort
(AUC:0.799,95%CI:0.692-0.905), which displayed good discrimination. The decision 
curve showed that predicting the steroid-refractory risk in ITP patients using
this nomogram with a range of the threshold probability between >16% and <70%.
The nomogram appears good performance in predicting steroid-refractory ITP
patients.
CONCLUSION: Prediction model shows that elder patients with a high level of
ferritin and positive expression of HBsAg may appear a high possibility of
steroid-resistance. For these patients, TPO-RAs can be considered to help
patients to get better treatment effects and develop a better health-related
quality of life.
