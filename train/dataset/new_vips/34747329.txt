During the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults experienced great levels of social
isolation and feelings of loneliness. We developed a telephone reassurance
program, Caring Callers, to provide a weekly phone call to socially isolated
older adults. Dyads were created which comprised of a Senior Companion volunteer 
and a homebound older adult. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined the
program's impact on homebound older adults. The participants were satisfied with 
the program and showed a significant increase in overall health. They discussed
social and emotional benefits of the program and other benefits that they gained 
from community resources. Due to the vulnerability of the participants, this
telephone-based intervention seemed feasible without technological barriers. It
is critical that aging service providers recognize the resourcefulness and
relatability of older adult volunteers and utilize them to continue to support
socially isolated older adults during an unprecedented event affecting people's
isolation.
