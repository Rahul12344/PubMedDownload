Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus of positive polarity
[ssRNA(+)] that replicates its genome through the activity of one of its
proteins, called NS5B. This viral protein is responsible for copying the
positive-polarity RNA genome into a negative-polarity RNA strand, which will be
the template for new positive-polarity RNA genomes. The NS5B protein is
phosphorylated by cellular kinases, including Akt. In this work, we have
identified several amino acids of NS5B that are phosphorylated by Akt, with
positions S27, T53, T267, and S282 giving the most robust results. Site-directed 
mutagenesis of these residues to mimic (Glu mutants) or prevent (Ala mutants)
their phosphorylation resulted in a reduced NS5B in vitro RNA polymerase
activity, except for the T267E mutant, the only non-conserved position of all
those that are phosphorylated. In addition, in vitro transcribed RNAs derived
from HCV complete infectious clones carrying mutations T53E/A and S282E/A were
transfected in Huh-7.5 permissive cells, and supernatant viral titers were
measured at 6 and 15 days post-transfection. No virus was rescued from the
mutants except for T53A at 15 days post-transfection whose viral titer was
statistically lower as compared to the wild type. Therefore, phosphorylation of
NS5B by cellular kinases is a mechanism of viral polymerase inactivation. Whether
this inactivation is a consequence of interaction with cellular kinases or a way 
to generate inactive NS5B that may have other functions are questions that need
further experimental work.
