Increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates is an established public health strategy
to reduce chronic disease and protect infants from illness. The role of
breastfeeding in addressing health disparities takes on new significance as the
COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted some communities in Hawai'i,
and those with chronic conditions face increased risk of hospitalization and
death. However, there are myriad policy, systemic, and environmental barriers
that make it difficult for parents to breastfeed, some of which have been
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This editorial discusses the importance of 
breastfeeding in reducing chronic disease, reviews the status of breastfeeding in
Hawai'i, explores the challenges parents face in breastfeeding their infants,
especially in the time of COVID-19, and presents opportunities for improved
access to lactation care to reduce health disparities.
