We evaluated families' perspectives on the usability of virtual visits for
routine gender care for trans youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online
survey, which included a validated telehealth usability questionnaire, was sent
to families who had a virtual Gender Clinic visit between March and August 2020. 
A total of 87 participants completed the survey (28 trans youth, 59 caregivers). 
Overall, usability was rated highly, with mean scores between "quite a bit" and
"completely" in all categories (usefulness, ease of use, interface and
interaction quality, reliability, and satisfaction). Caregivers reported higher
usability scores compared to trans youth [mean (SD) 3.43 (0.80) vs. 3.12 (0.93), 
p = 0.01]. All families felt that virtual visits provided for their healthcare
needs. A total of 100% of youth and caregivers described virtual appointments as 
safer or as safe as in-person visits. A total of 94% of participants would like
virtual visits after the pandemic; families would choose a mean of two virtual
and one yearly in-person visit with a multidisciplinary team. Overall, virtual
gender visits for trans youth had impressive usability. Participants perceived
virtual visits to be safe. For the future, a combination of virtual and in-person
multidisciplinary visits is the most desired model.
