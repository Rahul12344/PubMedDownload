BACKGROUND: Facing a severe life-threatening disease has physical and emotional
consequences for patients.
AIM: To evaluate the physical and emotional sequelae in patients who survived
COVID-19 pneumonia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study collected data from
post-COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to an outpatient follow-up program in a
public hospital in Chile. One month after hospital discharge, the evaluation of
physical capacity was carried out through the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1STST).
In addition, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression scale were applied.
RESULTS: We included 70 patients aged 63 ± 13 years (54% women). Eighty-five
percent of the patients were able to execute the 1STST with an average of 20.6 ± 
4.8 repetitions. Forty-eight percent of the patients had a performance below the 
2.5th percentile according to the reference values and 28% of patients had
exertional desaturation. The CFS classified as mildly vulnerable or with some
degree of frailty to 33% of patients. Twenty-five percent of the patients
presented symptoms of depression and 33% of anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who survived COVID-19 have a decrease in physical capacity 
and a significant proportion of depression and anxiety one month after hospital
discharge.
