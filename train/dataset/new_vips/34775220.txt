BACKGROUND: Neutralizing mAbs can prevent communicable viral diseases. MK-1654 is
a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (mAb) under development to prevent RSV infection in infants. Development
and validation of methods to predict efficacious doses of neutralizing antibodies
across patient populations exposed to a time-varying force of infection (i.e.,
seasonal variation) are necessary.
METHODS: Five decades of clinical trial literature were leveraged to build a
model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) describing the relationship between RSV serum
neutralizing activity (SNA) and clinical endpoints. The MBMA was validated by
backward translation to animal challenge experiments and forward translation to
predict results of a recent RSV mAb trial. MBMA predictions were evaluated
against a human trial of 70 participants who received either placebo or one of
four dose-levels of MK-1654 and were challenged with RSV [NCT04086472]. The MBMA 
was used to perform clinical trial simulations and predict efficacy of MK-1654 in
the infant target population.
FINDINGS: The MBMA established a quantitative relationship between RSV SNA and
clinical endpoints. This relationship was quantitatively consistent with animal
model challenge experiments and results of a recently published clinical trial.
Additionally, SNA elicited by increasing doses of MK-1654 in humans reduced RSV
symptomatic infection rates with a quantitative relationship that approximated
the MBMA. The MBMA indicated a high probability that a single dose of ≥ 75 mg of 
MK-1654 will result in prophylactic efficacy (> 75% for 5 months) in infants.
INTERPRETATION: An MBMA approach can predict efficacy of neutralizing antibodies 
against RSV and potentially other respiratory pathogens.
