The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic continues to spread
worldwide with approximately 216 million confirmed cases and 4.49 million deaths 
to date. Intensive efforts are ongoing to combat this disease by suppressing
viral transmission, understanding its pathogenesis, developing vaccination
strategies, and identifying effective therapeutic targets. Individuals with
preexisting diabetes also show higher incidence of COVID-19 illness and poorer
prognosis upon infection. Likewise, an increased frequency of diabetes onset and 
diabetes complications has been reported in patients following COVID-19
diagnosis. COVID-19 may elevate the risk of hyperglycemia and other complications
in patients with and without prior diabetes history. It is unclear whether the
virus induces type 1 or type 2 diabetes or instead causes a novel atypical form
of diabetes. Moreover, it remains unknown if recovering COVID-19 patients exhibit
a higher risk of developing new-onset diabetes or its complications going
forward. The aim of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the
epidemiology and mechanisms of this bidirectional relationship between COVID-19
and diabetes. We highlight major challenges that hinder the study of
COVID-19-induced new-onset of diabetes and propose a potential framework for
overcoming these obstacles. We also review state-of-the-art wearables and
microsampling technologies that can further study diabetes management and
progression in new-onset diabetes cases. We conclude by outlining current
research initiatives investigating the bidirectional relationship between
COVID-19 and diabetes, some with emphasis on wearable technology.
