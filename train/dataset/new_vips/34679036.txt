Avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) is a causative agent of respiratory disease complex 
in turkeys and chickens that has recently been detected in Vietnam. Due to its
novelty, this study was conducted to elucidate the distribution of aMPV in
several provinces in northern Vietnam. By the application of Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and nested Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR), this study demonstrated the circulation of aMPV in 12 out of
14 cities/provinces with positive rates of 37.6% and 17.2%, respectively. All
nested RT-PCR positive samples were aMPV subgroup B. By pairing the detection
results with age groups, it was observed that aMPV infections occurred in
chickens of all ages. Additionally, by genetic characterization, aMPV strains
were demonstrated to not be attenuated vaccine viruses and to belong to at least 
two genetic clades. Overall, the obtained results provided insights into the
prevalence of aMPV and indicated a greater complexity of respiratory diseases in 
chickens in Vietnam.
