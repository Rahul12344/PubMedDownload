AIM: Healthcare personnel (HCP) are prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) vaccination to protect them and non-disruptive provision of healthcare
services. We assessed the impact of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on morbidity and 
absenteeism among HCP.
METHODS: We studied 7445 HCP in five tertiary-care hospitals in Greece from
November 15, 2020 through April 18, 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 910 episodes of absenteeism and 9695 days of absence were
recorded during the entire study period. Starting from January 4, 2021, 4823/7445
HCP (64.8%) were fully or partially vaccinated. Overall, 535 episodes of
absenteeism occurred from January 4, 2021 through April 18, 2021, including 309
(57.76%) episodes among 2622 unvaccinated HCP and 226 (42.24%) episodes among
4823 vaccinated HCP (11.8 versus 4.7 episodes of absenteeism per 100 HCP,
respectively; p-value < 0.001). The mean duration of absenteeism was 11.9 days
among unvaccinated HCP compared with 6.9 days among vaccinated HCP
(p-value < 0.001). Unvaccinated HCP more frequently developed acute respiratory
infection, influenza-like illness, and COVID-19 (p-values < 0.001 for all
comparisons). Vaccine effectiveness for fully vaccinated HCP was estimated at
94.16% [confidence interval (CI): 88.50%-98.05%) against COVID-19, 83.62% (CI:
73.36%-90.38%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection (asymptomatic or COVID-19), and
66.42% (CI: 56.86%-74.15%) against absenteeism.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on healthcare
workforce. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine significantly reduced morbidity, COVID-19,
absenteeism and duration of absenteeism among HCP during a period of high
SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the community. It is expected that HCP vaccination will
protect them and healthcare services and contain healthcare costs.
