Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has re-emerged as a global public health threat. The
inflammatory pathways of RAS and PPAR-γ are usually involved in viral infections.
Thus, Telmisartan (TM) with known capacity to block AT1 receptor and activate
PPAR-γ, was investigated against CHIKV. The anti-CHIKV effect of TM was
investigated in vitro (Vero, RAW 264.7 cells and hPBMCs) and in vivo (C57BL/6
mice). TM was found to abrogate CHIKV infection efficiently (IC50 of
15.34-20.89μM in the Vero and RAW 264.7 cells respectively). Viral RNA and
proteins were reduced remarkably. Additionally, TM interfered in the early and
late stages of CHIKV life cycle with efficacy in both pre and post-treatment
assay. Moreover, the agonist of AT1 receptor and antagonist of PPAR-γ increased
CHIKV infection suggesting TM's anti-viral potential by modulating host factors. 
Besides, reduced activation of all major MAPKs, NF-κB (p65) and cytokines by TM
through the inflammatory axis supported the fact that the anti-CHIKV efficacy of 
TM is partly mediated through the AT1/PPAR-γ/MAPKs pathways. Interestingly, at
the human equivalent dose, TM abrogated CHIKV infection and inflammation
significantly leading to reduced clinical score and complete survival of C57BL/6 
mice. Additionally, TM reduced infection in hPBMC derived monocyte-macrophage
populations in vitro. Hence, TM was found to reduce CHIKV infection by targeting 
both viral and host factors. Considering its safety and in vivo efficacy, it can 
be a suitable candidate in future for repurposing against CHIKV.
