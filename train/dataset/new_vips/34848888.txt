Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV,
lifelong treatment is required and there is no cure. HIV can integrate in the
host genome and persist for the life span of the infected cell. These latently
infected cells are not recognized as foreign because they are largely
transcriptionally silent, but contain replication-competent virus that drives
resurgence of the infection once ART is stopped. With a combination of immune
activators, neutralizing antibodies, and therapeutic vaccines, some nonhuman
primate models have been cured, providing optimism for these approaches now being
evaluated in human clinical trials. In vivo delivery of gene-editing tools to
either target the virus, boost immunity or protect cells from infection, also
holds promise for future HIV cure strategies. In this Review, we discuss advances
related to HIV cure in the last 5 years, highlight remaining knowledge gaps and
identify priority areas for research for the next 5 years.
