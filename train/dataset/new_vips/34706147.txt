OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether risk factor-based screening in pregnancy is
failing to identify women with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and to assess
the cost-effectiveness of universal screening.
DESIGN: Retrospective study and model-based economic evaluation.
SETTING: Two urban tertiary referral maternity units, currently using risk
factor-based screening for HCV infection.
POPULATION: Pregnant women who had been tested for hepatitis B, HIV but not HCV.
METHODS: Anonymised sera were tested for HCV antibody. Positive sera were tested 
for HCV antigen. A cost-effectiveness analysis of a change to universal screening
was performed using a Markov model to simulate disease progression and Monte
Carlo simulations for probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of HCV antigen and cost per quality-adjusted life
year (QALY).
RESULTS: In all, 4655 samples were analysed. Twenty had HCV antibodies and five
HCV antigen. This gives an active infection rate of 5/4655, or 0.11%, compared
with a rate of 0.15% in the risk-factor group. This prevalence is 65% lower than 
a previous study in the same hospitals from 2001 to 2005. The calculated
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for universal screening was €3,315
per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the prevalence of HCV infection in pregnant
women in the Dublin region has declined by 65% over the past two decades. Risk
factor-based screening misses a significant proportion of infections. A change to
universal maternal screening for hepatitis C would be cost-effective in our
population.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Universal maternal screening for hepatitis C is
cost-effective in this urban Irish population.
