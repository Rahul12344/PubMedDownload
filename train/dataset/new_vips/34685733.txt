Basophils and mast cells are among the principal inducers of Th2 responses and
have a crucial role in allergic and anti-parasitic protective immunity. Basophils
can function as antigen-presenting cells that bind antigens on their surface and 
boost humoral immune responses, inducing Th2 cell differentiation. Their
depletion results in lower humoral memory activation and greater infection
susceptibility. Basophils seem to have an active role upon immune response to
SARS-CoV-2. In fact, a coordinate adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is
magnified by basophils. It has been observed that basophil amount is lower during
acute disease with respect to the recovery phase and that the grade of this
depletion is an important determinant of the antibody response to the virus.
Moreover, mast cells, present in a great quantity in the nasal epithelial and
lung cells, participate in the first immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Their
activation results in a hyperinflammatory syndrome through the release of
inflammatory molecules, participating to the "cytokine storm" and, in a longer
period, inducing pulmonary fibrosis. The literature data suggest that basophil
counts may be a useful prognostic tool for COVID-19, since their reduction is
associated with a worse prognosis. Mast cells, on the other hand, represent a
possible therapeutic target for reducing the airway inflammation characteristic
of the hyperacute phase of the disease.
