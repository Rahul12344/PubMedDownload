SUMMARY: We present a web-based server for navigating and visualizing possible
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human host proteins. The interactions are
obtained from HMI_Pred which relies on the rationale that virus proteins mimic
host proteins. The structural alignment of the viral protein with one side of the
human protein-protein interface determines the mimicry. The mimicked human
proteins and predicted interactions, and the binding sites are presented. The
user can choose one of the 18 SARS-CoV-2 protein structures and visualize the
potential 3D complexes it forms with human proteins. The mimicked interface is
also provided. The user can superimpose two interacting human proteins in order
to see whether they bind to the same site or different sites on the viral
protein. The server also tabulates all available mimicked interactions together
with their match scores and number of aligned residues. This is the first server 
listing and cataloging all interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human protein
structures, enabled by our innovative interface mimicry strategy.
AVAILABILITY: The server is available at https://interactome.ku.edu.tr/sars/.
