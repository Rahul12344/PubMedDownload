The increased severity of COVID-19 infection due to new SARS-CoV-2 variants have 
resonated pandemic strategies to re-evaluate effectiveness of pandemic management
strategies. This becomes critical due to the shortcomings in the existing global 
healthcare system in all the developed countries. The designing of
high-performance nanosystems (NSs) with tunable performances seems to be the most
efficient method to tackle infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. The opinion projects
the versatile functionalized NSs and their innovative potential to mitigate
SARS-CoV-2 pathways by sensitization of virus, anti-pathogenicity,
photocatalysis, photo-thermal, immune response, and development of ultrasensitive
assays for SARS-CoV-2 or associated selective biomarkers identification. In this 
direction, we propose the fabrication of nano-enabled protective gears, masks,
gloves, sheets, filtration units, nano-emulsified disinfectants, paints, and
detection systems to facilitate improved quarantine or antiviral spaces.
Functional protective gears can even tackle the aerosol distribution of
infectious strains transmitted through respiratory fluids and pollutants within
droplets, aerosols, air, and particulates.
