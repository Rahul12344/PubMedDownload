This study measured the impacts of failure in Crisis and Emergency Risk
Communication (CERC) during the outbreak of a contagious Corona viral disease.
The study measured the impacts by the number of individuals and hospitals exposed
to the virus. The 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South 
Korea was used to investigate the consequences of CERC failure, where the names
of hospitals exposed to MERS-CoV were withheld from the public during the early
stage of virus diffusion. Empirical data analyses and simulated model tests were 
conducted. The findings of analyses and tests show that an early announcement of 
the hospital names and publicizing the necessary preventive measures could have
reduced the rate of infection by approximately 85% and the number of contaminated
healthcare facilities by 39% at maximum. This level of reduction is comparable to
that of vaccination and of social distancing.
