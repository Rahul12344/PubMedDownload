At the end of December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan city,
China. Modelling plays a crucial role in developing a strategy to prevent a
disease outbreak from spreading around the globe. Models have contributed to the 
perspicacity of epidemiological variations between and within nations and the
planning of desired control strategies. In this paper, a literature review was
conducted to summarise knowledge about COVID-19 disease modelling in three
countries-China, the UK and Australia-to develop a robust research framework for 
the regional areas that are urban and rural health districts of New South Wales, 
Australia. In different aspects of modelling, summarising disease and
intervention strategies can help policymakers control the outbreak of COVID-19
and may motivate modelling disease-related research at a finer level of regional 
geospatial scales in the future.
