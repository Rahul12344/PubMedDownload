When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the United States in early 2020, it caused 
an information explosion in the health science literature. Researchers wanted to 
share their results quickly, so they utilized sources that were not indexed in
conventional databases. Hospital librarians stepped up to meet the information
and public health challenges of the pandemic. They developed alternate strategies
to provide services and resources remotely at a time when their physical
libraries were closed to comply with the need for social distancing and
compliance with public health recommendations.
