Infections of orchids by the Odontoglossum ringspot virus or Cymbidium mosaic
virus cause orchid disfiguration and are a substantial source of economic loss
for orchid farms. Although immunoassays can identify these infections,
immunoassays are expensive, time consuming, and labor consuming and limited to
sampling-based testing methods. This study proposes a noncontact inspection
platform that uses a spectrometer and Android smartphone. When orchid leaves are 
illuminated with a handheld optical probe, the Android app based on the Internet 
of Things and artificial intelligence can display the measured florescence
spectrum and determine the infection status within 3 s by using an algorithm
hosted on a remote server. The algorithm was trained on optical data and the
results of polymerase chain reaction assays. The testing accuracy of the
algorithm was 89%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was
91%; thus, the platform with the algorithm was accurate and convenient for
infection screening in orchids.
