OBJECTIVES: Nationwide COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in India on January 16,
2021, in a phased manner with vaccines including Covishield. This vaccine was
indigenously prepared by Serum Institute of India in line with the
Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine developed at the University of Oxford. This is
the first multicenter study to assess the safety of the indigenously prepared
Covishield vaccine in India.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter observational descriptive study.
METHODS: This was a multicenter study carried out in northern and eastern India. 
Individuals who received the first dose of the Covishield vaccine were followed
up for 7 days to check for any adverse effects or systemic effects post
vaccination. The data were collected by the authors with a
participant-administered questionnaire. The primary end point was the incidence
of adverse or systemic effects within 7 days post vaccination.
RESULTS: No serious adverse or systemic effects were noted in 7 days of
follow-up. Nonserious systemic effects were seen in 42.0% of individuals post
vaccination. Myalgia and/or fatigue was the most common effect of vaccination in 
25.7%, followed by fever in 22.0% of individuals. In most individuals, the
systemic effects started 6 to 12 hours post vaccination. There were no reports of
fresh onset of systemic effects of any kind beyond 48 hours of vaccination. Women
and older adults tolerated the vaccination better.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of serious adverse effects in our study will help allay 
fears around vaccine acceptance and give a boost to the vaccination campaign
worldwide.
