BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led health institutions to cancel 
many of the activities including training in different fields. Most practices and
training programs have been encouraged to use teleproctoring as an alternative
method to enhance physician's ability and assure training. We aimed to evaluate
remote training program for endoscopy sleeve gastroplasty (ESG).
METHODS: Ten consecutive patients underwent an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty
procedure guided by a proctor expert using an online platform. A stepwise
approach was created to assure skill acquisition.
RESULTS: All cases were safely performed with no serious adverse events under
teleproctoring. The average surgical and suturing times significantly decreased
during the training model. From the first 5 cases to the last 5 ones, the
endoscopic procedure time decreased from 120 to 93.4 min while suturing time from
92.8 to 68.4 min. The effect size was large in both cases, and the changes were
meaningful according to the fitted learning curves.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed teleproctoring program was effective to deliver
advanced endoscopic skills such as endosuturing for ESG, despite the restrictions
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
