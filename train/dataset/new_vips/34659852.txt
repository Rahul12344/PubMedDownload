Purpose: Herein, we report a case of primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) with the
first presentation of bilateral Epstein-Barr virus- (EBV-) associated panuveitis.
Case Presentation. A 69-year-old male was referred with a three-day history of
blurred vision and pain and redness in his left eye following cataract surgery.
Examination revealed panuveitis, vitritis, and necrotizing retinitis with retinal
hemorrhage. A month later, the right eye was also involved. Polymerase chain
reaction-based analysis of the vitreous sample was positive for EBV, and
cytological evaluation was compatible with the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. A
significant improvement was observed following serial intravitreal rituximab and 
methotrexate injections. The central nervous system and lungs were involved after
6 months, and the patient expired despite systemic chemotherapy.
Conclusion: There may be an association between EBV panuveitis and primary
intraocular B-cell lymphoma.
