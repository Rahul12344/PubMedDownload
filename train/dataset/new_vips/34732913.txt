The provision of telehealth services has increased dramatically during the
COVID-19 pandemic with the introduction of various temporary waivers and rules
designed to increase flexibility in the pandemic response. This expansion of
telehealth has not only increased patient access, but protected essential
healthcare workers from potential virus exposure. The advantages of increased
telehealth services has prompted the introduction of a bipartisan bill in
Congress, which seeks to make some of the temporary measures undertaken during
the pandemic permanent. Pharmacists have been able to expand telehealth services 
further with the implementation of these regulatory changes.
