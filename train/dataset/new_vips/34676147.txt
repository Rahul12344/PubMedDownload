While chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain the first-line approaches for the
management of most unresectable tumors, immunotherapy has emerged in the past two
decades as a game-changing treatment, notably with the clinical success of immune
checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapies aim at (re)activating anticancer immune
responses which occur in two main steps: (1) the activation and expansion of
tumor-specific T cells following cross-presentation of tumor antigens by
specialized myeloid cells (priming phase); and (2) the immunological clearance of
malignant cells by these antitumor T lymphocytes (effector phase). Therapeutic
vaccines, adjuvants, monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, immunogenic cell
death-inducing agents including oncolytic viruses, anthracycline-based
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as adoptive cell transfer, all act at
different levels of this cascade to (re)instate cancer immunosurveillance.
Intratumoral delivery of these immunotherapeutics is being tested in clinical
trials to promote superior antitumor immune activity in the context of limited
systemic toxicity.
