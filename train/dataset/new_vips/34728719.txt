A high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is considered an unfavorable
prognostic factor in various diseases, including COVID-19. The prognostic value
of NLR in other respiratory viral infections, such as Influenza, has not hitherto
been extensively studied. We aimed to compare the prognostic value of NLR in
COVID-19, Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection (RSV). A
retrospective cohort of COVID-19, Influenza and RSV patients admitted to the Tel 
Aviv Medical Center from January 2010 to October 2020 was analyzed. Laboratory,
demographic, and clinical parameters were collected. Two way analyses of variance
(ANOVA) was used to compare the association between NLR values and poor outcomes 
among the three groups. ROC curve analyses for each virus was applied to test the
discrimination ability of NLR. 722 COVID-19, 2213 influenza and 482 RSV patients 
were included. Above the age of 50, NLR at admission was significantly lower
among COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). NLR was associated with poor clinical
outcome only in the COVID-19 group. ROC curve analysis was performed; the area
under curve of poor outcomes for COVID-19 was 0.68, compared with 0.57 and 0.58
for Influenza and RSV respectively. In the COVID-19 group, multivariate logistic 
regression identified a high NLR (defined as a value above 6.82) to be a
prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome, after adjusting for age, sex and
Charlson comorbidity score (odds ratio of 2.9, P < 0.001). NLR at admission is
lower and has more prognostic value in COVID-19 patients, when compared to
Influenza and RSV.
