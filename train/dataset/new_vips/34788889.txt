BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine administration has 
faced distribution barriers across the United States. We sought to delineate our 
vaccine delivery experience in the first week of vaccine availability, and our
effort to prioritize employees based on risk with a goal of providing an
efficient infrastructure to optimize speed and efficiency of vaccine delivery
while minimizing risk of infection during the immunization process.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to evaluate an employee
prioritization/invitation/scheduling system, leveraging an integrated electronic 
health record patient portal framework for employee COVID-19 immunizations at an 
academic medical center.
METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study during January 2021 
at a single urban academic center. All employees who met COVID-19 allocation
vaccine criteria for phase 1a.1 to 1a.4 were included. We implemented a
prioritization/invitation/scheduling framework and evaluated time from invitation
to scheduling as a proxy for vaccine interest and arrival to vaccine
administration to measure operational throughput.
RESULTS: We allotted vaccines for 13,753 employees but only 10,662 employees with
an active patient portal account received an invitation. Of those with an active 
account, 6,483 (61%) scheduled an appointment and 6,251 (59%) were immunized in
the first 7 days. About 66% of invited providers were vaccinated in the first 7
days. In contrast, only 41% of invited facility/food service employees received
the first dose of the vaccine in the first 7 days (p < 0.001). At the vaccination
site, employees waited 5.6 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.9-8.3) from
arrival to vaccination.
CONCLUSION: We developed a system of early COVID-19 vaccine prioritization and
administration in our health care system. We saw strong early acceptance in those
with proximal exposure to COVID-19 but noticed significant difference in the
willingness of different employee groups to receive the vaccine.
