Since COVID-19 occurrence in late 2019, intense research efforts on an
unprecedented scale have focused on the study of named severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry mechanisms and clinical presentations. 
As for other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 presents with extrarespiratory clinical
manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain which
highlight that the gastrointestinal (GI) system as another viral target along
with the typical presentations of COVID-19 which is characterized primarily by
respiratory symptoms. The digestive system is involved in many systemic functions
through the gut-brain axis and systemic immunity modulation. Therefore, the GI
system plays an important role in the presentation of the disease, pathogenesis, 
and possibly treatment outcomes. This minireview summarizes recent work to study 
SARS-CoV-2 infection as it relates to comorbidities, GI symptoms. This will help 
to strategize the priorities in understanding the impact of the virus on outcomes
in various aspects.
