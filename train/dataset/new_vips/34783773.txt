In the global and national context of the COVID 19 pandemic, early detection and 
prevention of mental illnesses in exposed populations is relevant in situations
of extreme demand. In this context, hospital workers are a highly demanded
population being a clear risk group. This work shows the partial results of an
investigation that is being carried out by the Mental Health Service of the
General Hospital "B. Rivadavia", of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA),
which aims to evaluate some aspects of the mental health of its staff. A survey
is underway that was proposed by the members of the Mental Health Service to the 
different sectors of the Hospital and sent electronically. The survey includes
indicators of the following aspects: symptoms of stress, the depressive and
anxious series and consumption of psychoactive substances. Partial results show
clear involvement of health personnel in different areas evaluated.
