Physical distancing measures to curb COVID-19 transmission introduced mental
health and economic stressors, possibly impacting problematic drinking. This
cross-sectional study examines mental health and economic stressors early in the 
COVID-19 pandemic which may be associated with heavy alcohol use and increased
alcohol use. We administered an online survey of U.S. adults via social media
April 5 to May 5, 2020. High-risk drinking was defined by WHO risk drinking
levels, a daily average of ≥4 drinks for men and ≥3 drinks for women.
Participants reported retrospective assessments of increased alcohol use if their
past-week alcohol consumption exceeded their past-year average weekly alcohol
consumption. We used logistic regression to assess possible covariates of
high-risk drinking and increased alcohol use. Among 2175 participants, 10%
(n = 222) reported high-risk drinking, and 36% (n = 775) reported increased
alcohol consumption. In multivariable analysis, high-risk drinking was
significantly associated with household job loss (OR = 1.41, 95%CI = (1.06,
1.88)) and depressive symptoms (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = (1.02, 1.07)), and women had 
higher odds of high-risk drinking than men (OR = 2.37, 95% CI = (1.32, 4.69)).
Previous mental health diagnosis was not significantly associated with high-risk 
drinking during the pandemic (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = (0.98, 1.76)) in univariable
analysis. High-risk drinkers were almost six times as likely to report
retrospective assessments of increased alcohol consumption, controlling for
mental health and economic stressors (OR = 5.97, 95% CI = (4.35, 8.32)). Findings
suggest a need for targeted interventions to address the complex mental health
and economic stressors that may increase alcohol consumption and high-risk
drinking during and after the pandemic.
