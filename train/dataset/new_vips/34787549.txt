INTRODUCTION: Coinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and another virus may influence the clinical trajectory of emergency
department (ED) patients. However, little empirical data exists on the clinical
outcomes of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 METHODS: In this retrospective cohort
analysis, we included adults presenting to the ED with confirmed, symptomatic
coronavirus 2019 who also underwent testing for additional viral pathogens within
24 hours. To investigate the association between coinfection status with each of 
the outcomes, we performed logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 6,913 ED patients, 5.7% had coinfection. Coinfected individuals were 
less likely to experience index visit or 30-day hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 
0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.90 and OR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.25-0.62,
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Coinfection is relatively uncommon in symptomatic ED patients with
SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical short- and long-term outcomes are more favorable in
coinfected individuals.
