INTRODUCTION: Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) 1 and 2 infections can lead to
neurological diseases, mainly in HIV/HTLV 1 coinfected. Furthermore, HTLV 1
infection in HIV/AIDS patients has also been associated with AIDS progression.
Despite this, HTLV 1/2 infections are not of mandatory notification in Brazil.
Here, we describe the prevalence of HTLV 1/2 in HIV/AIDS patients from Paraíba
state, Brazil, as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of the coinfected 
individuals.
METHODOLOGY: Information about HIV viral load and TCD4 lymphocyte count were
obtained from patients' records. Data on the patients' sociodemographic
characteristics were obtained by interview conducted after signing the informed
consent form. The serological diagnosis for HTLV 1/2 was performed by
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Western Blot (WB).
RESULTS: A total of 401 HIV/AIDS patients participated in the study, of whom
about 1.5% (6/401) were positive for antibodies against HTLV, specifically for
HTLV 1, evaluated by both ELISA and WB. No risk factors were found associated
with HIV/HTLV 1/2 coinfection.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a 1.5% prevalence of HTLV 1 infection in HIV/AIDS patients
from Paraíba state. Although we have not identified risk factors associated with 
HTLV 1, we describe the most observed sociodemographic characteristics in
HIV/HTLV 1 coinfection.
