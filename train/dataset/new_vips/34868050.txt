Introduction: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a well-known and safe
anti-inflammatory. At low-dose, it is prescribed to prevent secondary
cardiovascular events in those with pre-existing conditions and to prevent
preeclampsia. Little is known about how low-dose ASA affects the immune response.
In this study, we followed women to assess how ASA use modifies T cells immune
phenotypes in the blood and at the genital tract.
Methods: HIV uninfected women from Kenya were enrolled in this study and followed
for one month to assess baseline responses including systemic/mucosal baseline
immune activation. Participants then received 81mg of ASA daily for 6 weeks to
assess changes to T cell immune activation (systemic and mucosal) relative to
baseline levels.
Results: The concentration of ASA measured in the blood was 58% higher than the
level measured at the female genital tract. In the blood, the level of ASA was
inversely correlated with the following: the proportion of Th17 expressing HLA-DR
(p=0.04), the proportion of effector CD4+ T cells expressing CCR5 (p=0.03) and
the proportion of CD8+Tc17 expressing CCR5 (p=0.04). At the genital tract, ASA
use correlated with a decreased of activated CD4+T cells [CD4+CCR5+CD161+
(p=0.02) and CD4+CCR5+CD95+ (p=0.001)].
Conclusion: This study shows that ASA use impacts the immune response in both the
systemic and genital tract compartments. This could have major implications for
the prevention of infectious diseases such as HIV, in which the virus targets
activated T cells to establish an infection. This could inform guidelines on ASA 
use in women.
