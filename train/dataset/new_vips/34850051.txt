BACKGROUND: We determined the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in air and on surfaces in
rooms of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and investigated patient
characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination.
METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, surface, and air samples were collected from the
rooms of 78 inpatients with COVID-19 at six acute care hospitals in Toronto from 
March to May 2020. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, cultured to determine 
potential infectivity, and whole viral genomes were sequenced. Association
between patient factors and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in surface samples were
investigated.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from surfaces (125/474 samples; 42/78
patients) and air (3/146 samples; 3/45 patients); 17% (6/36) of surface samples
from three patients yielded viable virus. Viral sequences from nasopharyngeal and
surface samples clustered by patient. Multivariable analysis indicated hypoxia at
admission, PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swab (cycle threshold of ≤30) on or after 
surface sampling date, higher Charlson co-morbidity score, and shorter time from 
onset of illness to sampling date were significantly associated with detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in surface samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The infrequent recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus from the
environment suggests that the risk to healthcare workers from air and
near-patient surfaces in acute care hospital wards is likely limited.
