OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought commercial, social,
and economic consequences in every country that has experienced substantial
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. The complete change in the environment that took
place due to the outbreak of the pandemic can lead to stressful situations,
especially among healthcare personnel.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic
between the 27 March 2020 and the 20 April 2020. The research included 1984
employees of emergency medical systems in seven European countries. An
internet-based questionnaire format was adopted for the study (ΩMc-Donald > 0.7).
RESULTS: The highest level of stress was experienced by personnel in the United
Kingdom M = 4.03, and the lowest by Norwegian employees M = 2.89. High levels of 
stress were also experienced by nurses from Spain and Poland. Women actively
working in the healthcare system during the pandemic experienced higher stress
levels than men.
CONCLUSIONS: Women working in European emergency medical systems are more
vulnerable to work-related stress, while carrying out emergency medical
procedures during the pandemic. Differences in the level of stress experienced
while carrying out duties in pre-hospital conditions were only found among
Spanish emergency medical system personnel.
