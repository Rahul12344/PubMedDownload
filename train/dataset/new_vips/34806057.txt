Biobanking infrastructures, which are crucial for responding early to new viral
outbreaks, share pathogen genetic resources in an affordable, safe, and impartial
manner and can provide expertise to address access and benefit-sharing issues.
The European Virus Archive has had a crucial role in the global response to the
COVID-19 pandemic by distributing EU-subsidised (free of charge) viral resources 
to users worldwide, providing non-monetary benefit sharing, implementing access
and benefit-sharing compliance, and raising access and benefit-sharing awareness 
among members and users. All currently available SARS-CoV-2 material in the
European Virus Archive catalogue, including variants of concern, are not access
and benefit-sharing cases per se, but multilateral benefit-sharing has
nevertheless occurred. We propose and discuss how a multilateral system enabling 
access and benefit-sharing from pathogen genetic resources, based on the European
Virus Archive operational model, could help bridge the discrepancies between the 
current bilateral legal framework for pathogen genetic resources and actual
pandemic response practices.
