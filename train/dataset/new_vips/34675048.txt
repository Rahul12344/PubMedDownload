The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in 
late 2019 has spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness
designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A better definition of the
pulmonary host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to understand viral
pathogenesis and to validate putative COVID-19 biomarkers that have been proposed
in clinical studies. Here, we use targeted transcriptomics of FFPE tissue using
the Nanostring GeoMX™ platform to generate an in-depth picture of the pulmonary
transcriptional landscape of COVID-19, pandemic H1N1 influenza and uninfected
control patients. Host transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes
associated with inflammation, type I interferon production, coagulation and
angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls.
SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs (emphasising the advantages of 
spatial transcriptomics) with the areas of high viral load associated with an
increased type I interferon response. Once the dominant cell type present in the 
sample, within patient correlations and patient-patient variation had been
controlled for, only a very limited number of genes were differentially expressed
between the lungs of fatal influenza and COVID-19 patients. Strikingly, the
interferon-associated gene IFI27, previously identified as a useful blood
biomarker to differentiate bacterial and viral lung infections, was significantly
upregulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to patients with
influenza. Collectively, these data demonstrate that spatial transcriptomics is a
powerful tool to identify novel gene signatures within tissues, offering new
insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2 to aid in patient triage and
treatment.
