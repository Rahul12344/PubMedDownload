While the COVID-19 pandemic has been the major focus for healthcare leaders since
early 2020, the opioid crisis has been growing in the background. Confronting
this emerging problem will require new thinking. Guest editors Anne Wojtak and

director of Knowledge Translation and Evaluation, at the Dr. Peter AIDS
Foundation in Vancouver to gain their insights into how leaders can respond
effectively.
