Introduction: Preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is central 
to containing the HIV pandemic. For pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and 
PEP), drugs approved in Germany are available. Basic information on this should
be obtained from physicians in further training to become specialists in General 
Practice (GP) since they may have to deal with this topic of high relevance for
the health of patients at risk and also the physicians' health after a possible
exposure in the professional context.
Methodology: A multiple-choice questionnaire was handed out to doctors in further
training in General Practice on seminar days of the Competence Centre for General
Practice Saxony-Anhalt for an immediate answer.
Results: Of the 109 doctors, 73 completed the questionnaire. A general high
relevance of the topic HIV was stated by 95%. In contrast, 71% said it was
relevant for family doctor activities. The knowledge questions on the prevalence 
were answered correctly for all questions with less than 40%; 21% stated that
they knew the indication prerequisite for a PEP; 49% answered the question about 
the period of the highest efficacy of PEP correctly. PrEP as a drug option for
prophylaxis is known to a part of the respondents, 79% would prescribe PrEP, 69% 
were in favour of a health insurance benefit.
Discussion: The results show that the necessary basic knowledge about HIV is
partly available. Basic knowledge on structured action in the fields of HIV
testing, PEP and PrEP should be taught in a manner appropriate to the relevance
of the topic in the context of the German general practice setting. Even a basic 
knowledge about PEP may help to ensure that the general practice teams receive
proper measures after a possible exposition.
