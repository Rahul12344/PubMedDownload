Prediction of complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 is challenging on 
many grounds. Commonly used compartmental models struggle to handle an
epidemiological process that evolves rapidly and is spatially heterogeneous. On
the other hand, machine learning methods are limited at the beginning of the
pandemics due to small data size for training. We propose a deep learning
approach to predict future COVID-19 infection cases and deaths 1 to 4 weeks ahead
at the fine granularity of US counties. The multi-variate Long Short-term Memory 
(LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained on multiple time series samples at the
same time, including a mobility series. Results show that adding mobility as a
variable and using multiple samples to train the network improve predictive
performance both in terms of bias and of variance of the forecasts. We also show 
that the predicted results have similar accuracy and spatial patterns with a
standard ensemble model used as benchmark. The model is attractive in many
respects, including the fine geographic granularity of predictions and great
predictive performance several weeks ahead. Furthermore, data requirement and
computational intensity are reduced by substituting a single model to multiple
models folded in an ensemble model.
