The SARS-CoV-2 alpha VOC (also known as lineage B.1.1.7) initially described in
the autumn, 2020 in UK, rapidly became the dominant lineage across much of
Europe. Despite multiple studies reporting molecular evidence suggestive of its
circulation in Brazil, much is still unknown about its genomic diversity in the
state of São Paulo, the main Brazilian economic and transportation hub. To get
more insight regarding its transmission dynamics into the State we performed
phylogenetic analysis on all alpha VOC strains obtained between February and
August 2021 from the Sao Paulo state Network for Pandemic Alert of Emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants. The performed phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the 
alpha VOC genomes were interspersed with viral strains sampled from different
Brazilian states and other countries suggesting that multiple independent Alpha
VOC introductions from Brazil and overseas have occurred in the São Paulo State
over time. Nevertheless, large monophyletic clusters were also observed
especially from the Central-West part of the São Paulo State (the city of Bauru) 
and the metropolitan region of the São Paulo city. Our results highlight the
Alpha VOC molecular epidemiology in the São Paulo state and reinforce the need
for continued genomic surveillance strategies for the real-time monitoring of
potential emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants during the ever-growing vaccination
process.
