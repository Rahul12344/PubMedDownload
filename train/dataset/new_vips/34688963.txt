BACKGROUND: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on eosinophilic
esophagitis (EoE) and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize patients with EoE and EGIDs who had COVID-19,
assess severity of COVID-19 in the EoE/EGID population, and evaluate for
COVID-19-induced EoE/EGID flares.
METHODS: We established an online global registry collecting physician entered,
deidentified data related to patient demographics, EoE/EGID disease features,
comorbidities, and treatments, COVID-19 source of exposure, symptoms, illness
severity, hospitalizations, and deaths.
RESULTS: Ninety-four cases were reported between March 2020 and April 2021
(median age, 21 years; range, 1.5-53 years; 73% male). Most had atopy (73%), and 
80% had isolated EoE. Before COVID-19, the EoE/EGID activity was reported as
clinical remission in 51 (54%) and moderate in 20 (21%). EoE/EGID treatments at
the time of COVID-19 included proton pump inhibitors 49 (52%), swallowed/topical 
steroids 48 (51%), and dietary elimination 34 (36%). COVID-19 symptoms included
cough (56%), fever (49%), anosmia (21%), and ageusia (22%). Most patients with
COVID-19 had a mild course (70%), with 15% asymptomatic, 12% moderate, and 2%
severe. Three patients were hospitalized, and no intensive care unit admissions
or deaths were reported. Mean time from first symptoms to resolution in
symptomatic patients was 10 days (range, 1-90 days). A single EGID flare was
reported during COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: In a global EoE/EGID registry, relatively few COVID-19 cases have
been reported. COVID-19 severity was comparable to the general population. Based 
on this registry, it does not appear that patients with EoE are at increased risk
for severe COVID-19 infection or that COVID-19 leads to EGID flares.
