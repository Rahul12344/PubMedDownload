Many organizations created COVID-19 dashboards to communicate epidemiologic
statistics or community health capabilities with the public. In this paper we
used dashboard heuristics to identify common violations observed in COVID-19
dashboards targeted to citizens. Many of the faults we identified likely stem
from failing to include users in the design of these dashboards. We urge health
information dashboard designers to implement design principles and test
dashboards with representative users to ensure that their tools are satisfying
user needs.
