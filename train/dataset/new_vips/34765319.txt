Transgene-enhanced oncolytic adenoviruses represent a promising novel therapeutic
option for the treatment of cancer. A Phase 1 clinical trial featuring AdAPT-001 
is ongoing (NCT04673942). AdAPT-001, a type 5 adenovirus, which carries a TGF-β
trap transgene that neutralizes the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-β, has been
shown in an immunocompetent mouse model to eradicate both locally injected and
non-injected tumors. Single dose biodistribution of the TGF-β trap transgene was 
also evaluated in tumor bearing mice, providing an explanation for systemic
activity. The biodistribution and toxicity of a single administration of mouse
AdAPT-001 (mAdAPT-001) in 129S1 immunocompetent mice bearing ADS-12 tumors (mouse
lung carcinoma) were assessed. mAdAPT-001 was injected intratumorally and
intravenously in groups of 25 mice each at varying dose levels. Soluble TGF-β
trap was detected in the serum using ELISA. A single AdAPT-001 injection resulted
in non-negligible long-term TGF-β trap persistence in the serum over the 14-day
study after intravenous and intratumoral administration. No TGF-β-related
toxicity was observed. At clinically relevant doses, AdAPT-001 was safe and well 
tolerated. Systemic levels of the TGF-β trap transgene were observed from both
local and intravenous dosing.
