A 75-year-old woman with a history of postoperative chemotherapy for lung
adenocarcinoma and a history of Helicobacter pylori eradication for idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was admitted to the department of hematology and
oncology for the treatment of anemia 2 weeks after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19
vaccination. Her blood examination revealed direct and indirect Coombs
test-positive hemolytic anemia and elevation of serum LDH and indirect bilirubin 
levels. No obvious trigger other than BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was
found. She was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and oral
prednisolone therapy was administered. The anemia improved soon after the
administration of prednisolone. Although vaccination is considered to be very
important for suppressing the spread of COVID-19, there have been reports of
increasing risk of ITP development and deterioration caused by BNT162b2 mRNA
COVID-19 vaccination. Because the number of vaccinated people is increasing
rapidly, hematologists must be vigilant to the development of AIHA after BNT162b2
mRNA COVID-19 vaccination although case reports of this phenomenon have been very
rare thus far.
