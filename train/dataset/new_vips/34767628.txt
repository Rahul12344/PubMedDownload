OBJECTIVE: To quantify rates of influenza illness and assess value of influenza
vaccination among pregnant women in Panama and El Salvador.
METHODS: Pregnant women were enrolled and followed each week in a prospective
cohort study to identify acute respiratory infections (ARI). Nasopharyngeal swabs
obtained from women with febrile ARI were tested by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction for influenza and other respiratory viruses.
RESULTS: We enrolled 2,556 women between October 2014-April 2017. Sixteen percent
developed at least one ARI; 59 had two ARI, and five had three ARI for a total of
463 ARI. Women in El Salvador and Panama contributed 297 person-years (py) and
293py, respectively, during influenza circulation. Twenty-one (11%) of 196
sampled women tested positive for influenza. Influenza incidence was 5.0/100py
(4.3/100py in Panama and 5.7/100py in El Salvador). Only 13% of women in El
Salvador and 43% in Panama had been vaccinated against influenza before influenza
epidemics (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: One in six pregnant women developed ARI and more than one in ten ARI
were attributable to vaccine-preventable influenza. While women were at risk of
influenza, few had vaccinated before each epidemic. Such findings suggest the
utility of evaluations to optimize vaccine timing and coverage.
