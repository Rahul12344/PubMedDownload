Cardiovascular medicine is facing several challenges in the current era,
dominated by the rapid spread of a previously unknown virus around the world.
Indeed, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic set the course of cardiovascular science and
education in an extraordinary way, hogging the attention of the medical
community. Notably, while COVID-19 impacted research progress, there has been
considerable effort in exploring topics of great interest, from the management of
acute coronary syndromes to new horizons in the treatment of heart failure, from 
novelties in the surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease to new data on
implantable cardiac devices, and from new diagnostic applications of multimodal
imaging techniques to relevant basic science findings. Minerva Cardiology and
Angiology, formerly Minerva Cardioangiologica, has strived to inform its readers 
on these topics and novelties, aiming for a succinct yet poignant melding of
timeliness and accuracy. Accordingly, the purpose of this narrative review is to 
highlight and summarize the major research and review articles published during
2020. In particular, we provide a broad overview of the novelties identifying six
major areas of interest in the field of cardiovascular sciences in which new
evidences have contributed to improving prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
heart and vessels diseases.
