Aftermath of COVID-19: Forestalling Irreparable Medical Brain Drain in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

Onu JU, Oriji SO, Aluh DO, Onyeka TC.

With the escalation of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across the globe,
shortages in the already scarce medical workforce are imminent. Historically,
more developed economies have looked abroad to augment their health systems. This
paper aims to offer plausible solutions on how to avert future medical brain
drain from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the aftermath of COVID-19. We opine that
emigration of medical workers from low-resource settings to more industrialized
regions should be viewed by the destination countries as both a moral and an
ethical issue. Countries in SSA must generally provide good leadership, diversify
their economies, and ensure adequate security. Specifically, there are needs to
improve health care workers' remuneration, provide more opportunities for
specialization, and reduce waiting time for employment. It is our opinion that
such multisectoral and multi-modal approaches will effectively halt and even
reverse the on-going brain drain in the region, converting it to brain gain.
