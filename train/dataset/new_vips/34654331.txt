Hypercalcemia is one of the most commonly encountered laboratory abnormalities in
clinical medicine. Various causes have been well established. However, it is
likely that the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2), may be a newly found cause of this frequent finding, especially
amongst those with a history of cosmetic surgery, specifically by means of
silicone injection. In this case series, we describe 2 patients presenting with
symptomatic hypercalcemia likely from their prior silicone injections.
Interestingly, each patient only developed symptoms of hypercalcemia following
infection with SARS-CoV-2.
