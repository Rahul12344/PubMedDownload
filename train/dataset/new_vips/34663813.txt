COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a global pandemic. 3CL
protease is a virally encoded protein that is essential across a broad spectrum
of coronaviruses with no close human analogs. PF-00835231, a 3CL protease
inhibitor, has exhibited potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as
a single agent. Here we report, the design and characterization of a phosphate
prodrug PF-07304814 to enable the delivery and projected sustained systemic
exposure in human of PF-00835231 to inhibit coronavirus family 3CL protease
activity with selectivity over human host protease targets. Furthermore, we show 
that PF-00835231 has additive/synergistic activity in combination with
remdesivir. We present the ADME, safety, in vitro, and in vivo antiviral activity
data that supports the clinical evaluation of PF-07304814 as a potential COVID-19
treatment.
