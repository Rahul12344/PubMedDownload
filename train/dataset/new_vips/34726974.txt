OBJECTIVE: Traditional public health surveillance of nonfatal opioid overdose
relies on emergency department (ED) billing data, which can be delayed
substantially. We compared the timeliness of 2 new data sources for rapid drug
overdose surveillance-emergency medical services (EMS) and syndromic
surveillance-with ED billing data.
METHODS: We used data on nonfatal opioid overdoses in Kentucky captured in EMS,
syndromic surveillance, and ED billing systems during 2018-2019. We evaluated the
time-series relationships between EMS and ED billing data and syndromic
surveillance and ED billing data by calculating cross-correlation functions,
controlling for influences of autocorrelations. A case example demonstrates the
usefulness of EMS and syndromic surveillance data to monitor rapid changes in
opioid overdose encounters in Kentucky during the COVID-19 epidemic.
RESULTS: EMS and syndromic surveillance data showed moderate-to-strong
correlation with ED billing data on a lag of 0 (r = 0.694; 95% CI, 0.579-0.782; t
= 9.73; df = 101; P < .001; and r = 0.656; 95% CI, 0.530-0.754; t = 8.73; df =
101; P < .001; respectively) at the week-aggregated level. After the COVID-19
emergency declaration, EMS and syndromic surveillance time series had steep
increases in April and May 2020, followed by declines from June through September
2020. The ED billing data were available for analysis 3 months after the end of a
calendar quarter but closely followed the trends identified by the EMS and
syndromic surveillance data.
CONCLUSION: Data from EMS and syndromic surveillance systems can be reliably used
to monitor nonfatal opioid overdose trends in Kentucky in near-real time to
inform timely public health response.
