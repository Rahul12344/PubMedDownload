BACKGROUND: The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2),
first identified in India, is currently replacing pre-existing variants in many
parts of the world. To help guide public health policies it is important to
monitor efficiently its spread. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for
identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in
many regions.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a rapid, simple and inexpensive alternative to
sequencing for Delta identification.
METHODS: A double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR) was developed.
The technique exploits allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene
mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of
each primer was enhanced by an additional mismatch located at the fourth
nucleotide from the 3' end. Specificity was assessed by testing well
characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of
which had previously been fully sequenced.
RESULTS: In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were
entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to
discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants (Alpha and
Beta), and 'wild-type' SARS-CoV-2. Influenza A and RSV were non-reactive in the
assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2
RT-qPCR screening assay. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to
insufficient virus were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR.
CONCLUSION: The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory
that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the
spread of the Delta variant globally.
