OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility and acceptability of a short-term reminder and
incentives intervention in adolescents with low adherence to asthma medications.
METHODS: Mixed-methods feasibility study in a tertiary care clinic. Adolescents
recruited to a 24-week programme with three 8-weekly visits, receiving electronic
reminders to prompt inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) inhalation through a mobile app 
coupled with electronic monitoring devices (EMD). From the second visit, monetary
incentives based on adherence of ICS inhalation: £1 per dose, maximum £2 /day, up
to £112/study, collected as gift cards at the third visit. End of study
interviews and questionnaires assessing perceptions of asthma and ICS, analysed
using the Perceptions and Practicalities Framework.
PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (11-18 years) with documented low ICS adherence (<80%
by EMD), and poor asthma control at the first clinic visit.
RESULTS: 10 out of 12 adolescents approached were recruited (7 males, 3 females, 
12-16 years). Eight participants provided adherence measures up to the fourth
visits and received rewards. Mean study duration was 281 days, with 7/10
participants unable to attend their fourth visit due to COVID-19 lockdown. Only
3/10 participants managed to pair the app/EMD up to the fourth visit, which was
associated with improved ICS adherence (from 0.51, SD 0.07 to 0.86, SD 0.05).
Adherence did not change in adolescents unable to pair the app/EMD. The
intervention was acceptable to participants and parents/guardians. Exit
interviews showed that participants welcomed reminders and incentives, though
expressed frustration with app/EMD technological difficulties. Participants
stated the intervention helped through reminding ICS doses, promoting
self-monitoring and increasing motivation to take inhalers.
CONCLUSIONS: An intervention using electronic reminders and incentives through an
app coupled with an EMD was feasible and acceptable to adolescents with asthma. A
pilot randomised controlled trial is warranted to better estimate the effect size
on adherence, with improved technical support for the EMD.
