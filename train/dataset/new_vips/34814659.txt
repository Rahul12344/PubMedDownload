Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
pandemic outbreak, vaccines gained a growing role. Possible vaccine-related side 
effects range from minor local events to more prominent systemic manifestations
up to anaphylactic reactions. A heterogeneous spectrum of cutaneous reactions has
been reported, ranging from local injection site reactions to urticarial and
morbilliform eruptions, pernio/chilblains and zoster flares. Here, we describe a 
case of varicella zoster virus reactivation following mRNA coronavirus 2019
vaccine and discuss the available literature upon the topic published so far.
