Purpose: Granulysin (GNLY) is a cytotoxic granule that has been reported to have 
various antimicrobial activities. We evaluated the association between a missense
variant in GNLY (rs11127) and treatment efficacy of pegylated interferon-alpha
(PegIFNα) or nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B
(CHB).
Patients and Methods: We included a total of 1823 patients with hepatitis B e
antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB (954 patients treated with PegIFNα and 869 patients 
treated with NUCs) in four Phase IV multicenter randomized controlled trials. The
association of the GNLY rs11127 genotype with the combined response (CR), defined
as HBeAg seroconversion and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level <2000 IU/mL was
evaluated. A polygenic score (PGS) was constructed to evaluate the cumulative
effect of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs11127 and 
several other SNPs, STAT4 rs7574865, CFB rs12614, and CD55 rs28371597, which were
reported to be associated with CR.
Results: GNLY rs11127 was significantly associated with CR in patients treated
with PegIFNα. The CR rate in patients with the rs11127 CC genotype was higher
than that with the CT or TT genotype (40.98% vs 30.34% or 27.09%, P = 0.003).
Furthermore, a PGS integrating GNLY rs11127 and three other SNPs was
significantly associated with CR in PegIFNα-treated patients (P < 0.001).
However, no significant correlation was found between GNLY rs11127 and CR in
NUCs-treated patients.
Conclusion: GNLY rs11127 is an independent biomarker for predicting the response 
to PegIFNα therapy in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. Furthermore, the PGS,
including GNLY rs11127, provides new insights for individualized treatment in
clinical practice.
