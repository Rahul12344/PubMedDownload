BACKGROUND: Wall-associated kinase (WAK)/WAK-like (WAKL) is one of the subfamily 
of receptor like kinases (RLK). Although previous studies reported that WAK/WAKL 
played an important role in plant cell elongation, response to biotic and abiotic
stresses, there are no systematic studies on RcWAK/RcWAKL in rose.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a total of 68 RcWAK/RcWAKL gene family
members within rose (Rosa chinensis) genome. The RcWAKs contained the
extracellular galacturonan-binding domain and calcium-binding epidermal growth
factor (EGF)-like domain, as well as an intracellular kinase domains. The RcWAKLs
are missing either calcium-binding EGF-like domain or the galacturonan-binding
domain in their extracellular region. The phylogenetic analysis showed the
RcWAK/RcWAKL gene family has been divided into five groups, and these
RcWAK/RcWAKL genes were unevenly distributed on the 7 chromosomes of rose. 12 of 
RcWAK/RcWAKL genes were significantly up-regulated by Botrytis cinerea-inoculated
rose petals, where RcWAK4 was the most strongly expressed. Virus induced gene
silencing of RcWAK4 increased the rose petal sensitivity to B. cinerea. The
results indicated RcWAK4 is involved in the resistance of rose petal against B.
cinerea.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides useful information to further investigate the
function of the RcWAK/RcWAKL gene family and breeding research for resistance to 
B. cinerea in rose.
