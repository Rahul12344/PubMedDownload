BACKGROUND Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection showed the presence of resistant-associated substitutions (RASs). The
aim of the present study was to carry out a follow-up of patients with baseline
RASs to report the impact of RASs on DAA therapy outcome. METHODS In a cohort
study, we analyzed NS5A and NS5B RASs among nine thalassemia cases by baseline
RASs. In a 2-year follow-up, we analyzed viral markers and biochemical and
hematological parameters of the participants and their sustained virologic
response (SVR). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version
22. RESULTS RASs for HCV subtype 1a included M28V, L31M, and H58P. For subtype
1b: L28M, R30Q, S24F, and C316N. And for subtype 3a: C316S, and S24F. In patients
with cirrhosis (n = 5), ALT (p = 0.001) and AST (p = 0.007) levels were
significantly reduced after treatment, and creatinine level slightly increased (p
= 0.025). However, no significant data was observed in non-cirrhotic patients
following the treatment. CONCLUSION The present study did not show any adverse
effects of DAA therapy among patients with thalassemia suffering from chronic HCV
infection with baseline RASs. Furthermore, reduction in ferritin and liver
stiffness levels after DAA therapy could show the efficacy of DAA in such
patients.
