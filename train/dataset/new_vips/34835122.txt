Viral protein 35 (VP35) of Ebola virus (EBOV) is a multifunctional protein that
mainly acts as a viral polymerase cofactor and an interferon antagonist. VP35
interacts with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and double-stranded RNA for viral RNA
transcription/replication and inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production,
respectively. The C-terminal portion of VP35, which is termed the IFN-inhibitory 
domain (IID), is important for both functions. To further identify critical
regions in this domain, we analyzed the physical properties of the surface of
VP35 IID, focusing on hydrophobic patches, which are expected to be functional
sites that are involved in interactions with other molecules. Based on the known 
structural information of VP35 IID, three hydrophobic patches were identified on 
its surface and their biological importance was investigated using minigenome and
IFN-Î² promoter-reporter assays. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that some of
the amino acid substitutions that were predicted to disrupt the hydrophobicity of
the patches significantly decreased the efficiency of viral genome
replication/transcription due to reduced interaction with NP, suggesting that the
hydrophobic patches might be critical for the formation of a replication complex 
through the interaction with NP. It was also found that the hydrophobic patches
were involved in the IFN-inhibitory function of VP35. These results highlight the
importance of hydrophobic patches on the surface of EBOV VP35 IID and also
indicate that patch analysis is useful for the identification of amino acid
residues that directly contribute to protein functions.
