CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic led to several changes to methadone treatment
protocols at federal opioid treatment programs in the USA.
ISSUE: Protocol changes were designed to reduce transmission of COVID-19 while
allowing for continuity of care, but those changes also demonstrated that many
policies surrounding opioid use disorder care in the USA cause unnecessary
burdens to patients. In this commentary, we describe how current policies create 
and maintain fatal barriers to methadone treatment for people in rural
communities who have opioid use disorder, and highlight how COVID-19 adaptations 
and more flexible methadone models in other countries can better allow for
effective and accessible care. Reasons and ways to address these issues to create
lasting solutions for rural communities are discussed.
LESSONS LEARNED: We focus on three lessons: (1) methadone dispensing and
take-home schedules during COVID-19, (2) telehealth services during COVID-19, and
(3) international models in use prior to COVID-19. We then outline
recommendations for each lesson to improve access to methadone treatment long
term for rural communities in the USA. There is an urgent need to implement
recommendations that maintain flexible approaches and address methadone treatment
barriers in the rural USA. To achieve lasting health policy change and combat
stigma about addiction and methadone treatment, there is a need for advocacy
efforts that give voice to rural residents impacted by inequitable access to
methadone treatment and rural-tailored educational initiatives that promote the
evidence base for methadone. We hope opioid treatment program directors,
regulatory authorities, and health policymakers consider our recommendations.
