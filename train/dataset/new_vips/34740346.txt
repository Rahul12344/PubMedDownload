BACKGROUND: Since the end of January 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
has been responsible for a global health crisis. In England a number of
non-pharmaceutical interventions have been introduced throughout the pandemic,
including guidelines on healthcare attendance (for example, promoting remote
consultations), increased handwashing and social distancing. These interventions 
are likely to have impacted the incidence of non-COVID-19 conditions as well as
healthcare seeking behaviour. Syndromic Surveillance Systems offer the ability to
monitor trends in healthcare usage over time.
METHODS: This study describes the indirect impact of COVID-19 on healthcare
utilisation using a range of syndromic indicators including eye conditions,
mumps, fractures, herpes zoster and cardiac conditions. Data from the syndromic
surveillance systems monitored by Public Health England were used to describe the
number of contacts with NHS 111, general practitioner (GP) In Hours (GPIH) and
Out-of-Hours (GPOOH), Ambulance and Emergency Department (ED) services over
comparable periods before and during the pandemic.
RESULTS: The peak pandemic period in 2020 (weeks 13-20), compared to the same
period in 2019, displayed on average a 12% increase in NHS 111 calls, an 11%
decrease in GPOOH consultations, and a 49% decrease in ED attendances. In the GP 
In Hours system, conjunctivitis consultations decreased by 64% and mumps
consultations by 31%. There was a 49% reduction in attendance at EDs for
fractures, and there was no longer any weekend increase in ED fracture
attendances, with similar attendance patterns observed across each day of the
week. There was a decrease in the number of ED attendances with diagnoses of
myocardial ischaemia.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically impacted healthcare utilisation for
non-COVID-19 conditions, due to a combination of a probable decrease in incidence
of certain conditions and changes in healthcare seeking behaviour. Syndromic
surveillance has a valuable role in describing and understanding these trends.
