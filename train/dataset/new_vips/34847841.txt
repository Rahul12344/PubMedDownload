BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by contagious viruses are 
common among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Early
detection of these viruses can help prevent nosocomial transmission.
AIM: To investigate the efficacy of three rapid molecular methods, namely
FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel plus (FAP plus), ID NOW™ Influenza A and B 2 (ID NOW2)
point-of-care test, and an in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
test, to identify patients with viral RTIs requiring isolation in an emergency
setting.
METHODS: We included a FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel plus in the initial workup of
patients with suspected RTIs during a flu season. The RT-PCR and the influenza
point-of-care test were performed as part of routine diagnostics, on demand from 
the treating physicians. We compared viral detections and compared time to
positive test results for each method.
FINDINGS: The FAP plus significantly reduced the turnaround time and was able to 
identify 95% patients with potential contagious viral RTI. Routine diagnostics
ordered by the treating physician had a turnaround time of a median 22 h and
detected 87% of patients with potential contagious viral RTI. In patients that
had all three tests, the ID NOW2 detected 62% of patients with influenza.
CONCLUSIONS: The FAP plus was able to rapidly and reliably identify patients with
potential contagious viral RTIs; its use was feasible in the ED setting. Failing 
to test patients with viral RTI and using tests with long turnaround time may
lead to nosocomial transmission of viral infections and adverse patient outcomes.
