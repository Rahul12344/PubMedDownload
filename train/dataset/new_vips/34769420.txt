Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a cancer-related virus which
engages in two forms of infection: latent and lytic. Latent infection allows the 
virus to establish long-term persistent infection, whereas the lytic cycle is
needed for the maintenance of the viral reservoir and for virus spread. By using 
recombinant KSHV viruses encoding mNeonGreen and mCherry fluorescent proteins, we
show that various cell types that are latently-infected with KSHV can be
superinfected, and that the new incoming viruses establish latent infection.
Moreover, we show that latency establishment is enhanced in superinfected cells
compared to primary infected ones. Further analysis revealed that cells that
ectopically express the major latency protein of KSHV, LANA-1, prior to and
during infection exhibit enhanced establishment of latency, but not cells
expressing LANA-1 fragments. This observation supports the notion that the
expression level of LANA-1 following infection determines the efficiency of
latency establishment and avoids loss of viral genomes. These findings imply that
a host can be infected with more than a single viral genome and that
superinfection may support the maintenance of long-term latency.
