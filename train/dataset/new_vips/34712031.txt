BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies from Asia indicate that HLA-DP and
HLA-DQ loci are important in persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. One
of the key elements for HBV-related carcinogenesis is persistent viral
replication and inflammation.
AIM: To examine genetic and nongenetic factors with persistent HBV infection and 
viral load in families with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: The HCC families included 301 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
carriers and 424 noncarriers born before the nationwide vaccination program was
initiated in 1984. Five HBV-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -
rs477515, rs9272105, rs9276370, rs7756516, and rs9277535 - were genotyped.
Factors associated with persistent HBV infection and viral load were analyzed by 
a generalized estimating equation.
RESULTS: In the first-stage persistent HBV study, all SNPs except rs9272105 were 
associated with persistent infection. A significantly higher area under the
reciprocal operating characteristic curve for nongenetic factors vs genetic
factors (P < 0.001) suggests that the former play a major role in persistent HBV 
infection. In the second-stage viral load study, we added 8 HBsAg carriers born
after 1984. The 309 HBsAg carriers were divided into low (n = 162) and high viral
load (n = 147) groups with an HBV DNA cutoff of 105 cps/mL. Sex, relationship to 
the index case, rs477515, rs9272105, and rs7756516 were associated with viral
load. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, genetic and 
nongenetic factors affected viral load equally in the HCC family cohort (P =
0.3117).
CONCLUSION: In these east Asian adults, the mechanism of persistent HBV
infection-related SNPs was a prolonged viral replication phase.
