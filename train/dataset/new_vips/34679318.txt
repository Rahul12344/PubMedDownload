West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most common mosquito borne cause of viral
encephalitis in the United States. Physical and neuro-cognitive recovery from
WNND may be prolonged or incomplete leading to chronic cognitive inefficiencies
and functional decline. There continues to be no effective treatment of WNV and
current management is primarily supportive. The objective of this review is to
evaluate the functional outcomes and role of rehabilitation services in subjects 
with WNND. The charts of five subjects admitted to an acute inpatient brain
injury rehabilitation facility from June to December 2012 were retrospectively
reviewed. (Mean, Range)-Age (64.8, 43-78 years), Admission Functional
Independence Measure (FIM) (45.2, 14-63), Discharge FIM (82.2, 61-100), FIM score
gain (37, 24-60), Cognitive FIM gain (7, 1-18), Mobility FIM gain (17.4, 13-20), 
ADL FIM gain (12.6, 4-23); acute brain injury inpatient rehabilitation facility
length of stay (LOS) (17.8, 14-21 days); acute hospital LOS (15, 10-22 days). Of 
the five subjects, three were discharged home, one was discharged to a skilled
nursing facility, and one was discharged to an assisted living facility. Subjects
with WNND have significant functional decline across all FIM subcategories and
may benefit from a course of brain injury-specific acute inpatient
rehabilitation.
