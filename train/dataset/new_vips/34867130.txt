We study the effect of the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ on the kinetics of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
with the aim to characterize the interaction mechanism of the SARS-CoV2 virus
with its host cell. This peptide corresponds to the sequence 24-42 of the ACE2 α1
domain, which marks the binding site for the S1 protein. The kinetics of S1-ACE2 
complex formation was measured in the presence of various concentrations of the
peptide using bio-layer interferometry. Formation of the S1-ACE2 complex was
inhibited by the peptide in cases where it was preincubated with S1 protein
before the binding experiment. The kinetic analysis of S1-ACE2 complex
dissociation revealed that preincubation stabilized this complex, and this effect
was dependent on the peptide concentration as well as the preincubation time. The
results point to the formation of the ternary complex of S1 with ACE2 and the
peptide. This is possible in the presence of another binding site for the S1
protein beside the receptor-binding domain for ACE2, which binds the peptide
QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ. Therefore, we conducted computational mapping of the S1
protein surface, revealing two additional binding sites located at some distance 
from the main receptor-binding domain on S1. We suggest the possibility to
predict and test the short protein derived peptides for development of novel
strategies in inhibiting virus infections.Supplementary Information: The online
