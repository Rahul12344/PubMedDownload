There are large gaps in understanding the molecular machinery accounting for the 
association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with autoimmunity. Mixed
cryoglobulinemia (MC) is the most common HCV-associated extrahepatic
manifestation, which is characterized by B-cell lymphoproliferation and
autoantibody production. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is a member of the tumor
necrosis factor family and plays an important role in B-cell proliferation. We
explored the roles of hepatocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs (exo-miRNAs) and BAFF
in the extrahepatic diseases of HCV infection. The exo-miRNA profiles were
explored using a next-generation sequencing approach, followed by quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR validation. The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)
polymorphism were analyzed using quantitative PCR. The biological function of
exo-miRNAs and TLR7 polymorphism in BAFF expression was evaluated by using
immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Significantly increased
levels of BAFF, exosomes, and TLR7 were found in HCV patients, particularly in
those with MC (P < 0.005). HCV-infected hepatocyte-derived miR-122/let-7b/miR-206
upregulated BAFF expression in human macrophages through exosome transmission and
TLR7 activation. Analysis of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs3853839)
revealed that G-allele carriers had increased TLR7 transcripts, resulting in more
BAFF expression induced by hepatocyte-derived exo-miR-122, compared to those in
C-allele carriers (P < 0.005). We identified HCV-infected hepatocyte-derived
GU-enriched miRNAs (e.g., miR-122/let-7b/miR-206) as a TLR7 ligand that could
induce BAFF production in macrophages through exosome transmission. The
polymorphism in TLR7 is associated with the BAFF levels induced by exo-miR-122.
It may be a potential predisposing factor of MC syndrome development. IMPORTANCE 
HCV remains an important cause of liver disease worldwide. Accumulating evidence 
has demonstrated that HCV infection is associated with B cell lymphoproliferative
disorders such as MC. Approximately half of the patients infected with HCV
develop MC, but the real reason and regulatory mechanism is still uncertain.
Here, we demonstrate a novel relationship between HCV-infected hepatocyte-derived
exo-miRNAs, host genetic background in TLR7, and BAFF expression. We validate
that HCV-induced GU-enriched miRNAs (e.g., miR-122, let-7b, and miR-206)
upregulated BAFF expression through exosome transmission and TLR7 activation.
This mechanism of miRNAs action is implicated in HCV-infected hepatocyte-immune
system communication and is important in extrahepatic manifestation development, 
thus representing a possible target for HCV infection and extrahepatic diseases
treatment. In addition, we show that a functional polymorphism in TLR7 is a
potential predisposing factor of MC development. Our results elucidate the
molecular machinery in order to better understand the association of HCV
infection with autoimmunity.
