A 80-year-old man with the history of operations for gastric cancer and adhesive 
ileus developed abdominal pain. Positron emission computed tomography (CT) showed
prominent wall thickening in the ileum with a maximal standardized uptake value
of 12.1. Prior CT to diagnose adhesive ileus just taken only 4 months before did 
not show any masses in the abdomen. Single-balloon enteroscopy via colon showed a
protruding mass at approximately 40-50 cm proximal point from the ileum end.
Pathological examination of the biopsied specimen showed diffuse infiltration of 
medium- to large-sized atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed
that the atypical cells were positive for CD3 and CD56 and negative for CD8 and
CD20. MIB-1 labeling index was extremely high as 80%. Under the diagnosis of
intestinal T-cell lymphoma, the patient underwent tumorectomy, leading to the
diagnosis of monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL) after
the negativity confirmation of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded mRNAs. The patient
recovered with manageable complication and is going to receive chemotherapy. This
is the first case of MEITL with extremely rapid progression in the distal ileum
to be observed and diagnosed with single-balloon enteroscopy.
