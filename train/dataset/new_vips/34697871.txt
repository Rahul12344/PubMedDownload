AIM: Curing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection requires elimination of covalently 
closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Interferon (IFN)-γ has noncytolytic antiviral
potential; however, elimination of cccDNA could not be achieved. To enhance the
regulatory effect, we comprehensively analyzed the host factors associated with
cccDNA amplification and IFN-γ and IFN-α effects using an in vitro HBV infection 
system showing various transcription levels.
METHODS: Primary human hepatocytes were infected with HBV using genomic plasmids 
carrying the basic core promoter mutation A1762T/G1764A and/or the precore
mutation G1896A and treated with IFN-γ and IFN-α. Comprehensive and functional
studies involving microarray and small interfering RNA analysis revealed the host
factors related to cccDNA regulation.
RESULTS: The HBV infection system reproduced the HBV life cycle and showed
various propagation levels. Microarray analysis revealed 53 genes correlated with
the cccDNA levels. Of the 53 genes, expression of IFN-induced protein 44-like
(IFI44L) was significantly upregulated by IFN-γ and IFN-α. The anti-HBV effect of
IFI44L is exerted regardless of IFN-γ or IFN-α by inhibiting the activation of
nuclear factor-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the in vitro HBV infection system, an IFN-inducible molecule, 
IFI44L, associated with cccDNA amplification, was identified. These results
suggest an innovative molecular strategy for the regulation of HBV cccDNA by
controlling a novel host factor, IFI44L.
