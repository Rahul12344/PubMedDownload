Clinical laboratory services and associated training programs faced unprecedented
challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. With the introduction of
pandemic related strictly mandated institutional policies of physical distancing,
dermatopathology rotations, a key component of both dermatology and pathology
residency programs, were impacted. In order to adapt to this new environment, a
few modifications in resident training and education were introduced at various
institutions. These disruptions initiated a change in the standard teaching
approach, with a shift from face-to-face learning to a virtual and online model. 
These adaptations and innovations are discussed here with their likely benefits
and limitations.
