OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed Polish dentists' knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2
virus and the main problems in their work during the early phase of the pandemic.
METHODS: Dentists responded to an online anonymous survey consisting of 57
questions relating to socio-demographics, knowledge about COVID-19, and office
procedures. The obtained data were analyzed using basic descriptive statistics,
significance of dependencies and Chi square and Mann-Whitney tests; p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Ultimately, responses from 730 dentists were included. The mean age was 
43.62 Â± 11.57. Almost 3/4 of the respondents followed the information on
COVID-19. A total of 95.5% had knowledge about COVID-19. Genetic testing was the 
basic test according to 69.2%. Further, 56.0% were concerned about the pandemic, 
and 23.6% were significantly anxious. In addition, 42.1% considered a risk of
infection with the SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace as very high. A total of 84.0%
admitted patients performing a triage and using personal protective equipment
(PPE). Further, 44.5% planned to become vaccinated. Continuing the work during
the pandemic was strongly correlated with age, sector, and location and duration 
of work.
CONCLUSIONS: Most Polish dentists follow the information on the COVID-19 protocol
and have sufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Dentists are concerned and anxious 
about the situation. The vast majority admitted patients during the pandemic and 
use PPE. Only almost half plan to be vaccinated.
