OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the trend change of the most popular
Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5i) over time and geography by using Google
Trends (GT) data in 10 years period and COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: GT is able to generate a "line-graph", showing how
interest has increased or decreased over a period within specific territories.
The search values for specific terms are indexed as relative search volume (RSV),
which is presented on a scale from 0-100. Avarage annual percentage change (AAPC)
and RSV were analyzed to evaluate gain or loss of interest in trends. Search
terms were generated for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PDE5i;
tadalafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, avanafil, and their most-used brand names. The
data was within "worldwide" from 1 January 2010, to 31 December 2020, using the
''global'' query category.
RESULTS: The overall interest in PDE5i has doubled. Sildenafil has become the
most trend PDE5i of today with a regular increase (AAPC: 0.016, p < 0.01).
Although the search trend of tadalafil remained almost constant until 2014, the
rate of increase in the last 6 years raised and tadalafil has become the 2nd most
popular PDE5i recently (AAPC: 0.007, p < 0.01). For vardenafil there has been a
decreased interest (AAPC: -0.009, p < 0.01). There is no significant change in
avanafil trend (AAPC: 0.000, p: 0.5). All PDE5i interest on GT decreased notably 
from February to June 2020. But after June, search trends reached the level
before the COVID-19 period in a month.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show us, with its increasing prevalence, erectile
dysfunction (ED) has become a major public health problem. People from different 
geographies search the internet for ED treatment options. Patients should be
informed that ED may be the first sign of many comorbid diseases, and patients
with ED should be referred to a health institution for diagnosis and treatment.
