BACKGROUND: Simian varicella virus (SVV) is a primate herpesvirus that causes a
natural varicella-like disease in Old World monkeys and may cause epizootics in
facilities housing nonhuman primates. SVV infection of nonhuman primates is used 
as an experimental model to investigate varicella pathogenesis and to develop
antiviral strategies.
METHODS: An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to
detect SVV antibodies in infected rhesus macaque monkeys.
RESULTS: An ELISA determined SVV antibody titers following experimental
infection. SVV IgG was detected by day 14 post-infection and remained elevated
for at least 84 days.
CONCLUSIONS: The SVV ELISA is a safe and rapid approach to confirm SVV
seropositivity and to determine SVV antibody titers in naturally and
experimentally SVV-infected monkeys. In addition to being a useful diagnostic
assay to rapidly confirm acute disease or past SVV infection, the SVV ELISA is a 
valuable epidemiological tool to determine the incidence of SVV in non-human
primate facilities.
