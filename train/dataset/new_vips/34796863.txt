Before the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was identified, patients with hepatitis C were
treated with interferon. Alanine aminotranferase levels decreased in 25-50% of
treated patients, but only 10-20% had been cured, i.e. became HCV-RNA-negative.
Cure rates were improved to 40-60% by prolonging the duration of therapy and
adding ribavirin, but it was not until the introduction of direct acting
antivirals, that a cure for all patients was achieved. The time is now to
eliminate hepatitis C, and in this review we argue, that it will require outreach
and point-of-care testing and treating, but we expect Denmark to fulfil the WHO
elimination goals before 2030.
