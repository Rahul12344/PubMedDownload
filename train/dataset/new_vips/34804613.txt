Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of acute liver failure 
(ALF) in Bangladesh with pregnant mothers being more vulnerable. As HEV occurs in
epidemics, it limits medical capabilities in this resource-poor country. Cerebral
oedema, resulting in raised intracranial pressure (ICP), is an important cause of
morbidity and mortality. Practical treatments are currently few. To study the
baseline characteristics and clinical outcome of HEV-induced ALF in a recent HEV 
epidemicTo detect raised ICP clinically and observe response to mannitol
infusion.This was a prospective cohort study from June until August 2018 of 20
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a major Bangladeshi
Referral Hospital with HEV-induced ALF. We diagnosed HEV infection by detecting
serum anti-HEV IgM antibody. All were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen
and hepatitis A IgM antibody. Data were collected on 5-day outcome after
admission to ICU, monitoring all patients for signs of raised ICP. An intravenous
bolus of 20% mannitol was administered at a single time point to patients with
raised ICP.
Results: Twenty patients were included in the study. Ten (50%) patients, seven
(70%) females, received mannitol infusion. HE worsened in eight (40%): seven
female and three pregnant. Glasgow Coma scores deteriorated in six (30%): all
(100%) females and three pregnant. Consciousness status was not significantly
different between pregnant and non-pregnant subjects, nor between those who
received mannitol and those who did not. Six patients met King's College Criteria
for liver transplantation.
Conclusions: Female patients had a worse outcome, but pregnancy status was not an
additional risk factor in our cohort. Mannitol infusion was also not associated
with a significant difference in outcome.
