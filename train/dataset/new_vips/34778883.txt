Globally swine influenza is one of the most important diseases of the pig
industry, with various subtypes of swine influenza virus co-circulating in the
field. Swine influenza can not only cause large economic losses for the pig
industry but can also lead to epidemics or pandemics in the human population. We 
provide an overview of the pathogenic characteristics of the disease, diagnosis, 
risk factors for the occurrence on pig farms, impact on pigs and humans and
methods to control it. This review is designed to promote understanding of the
epidemiology of swine influenza which will benefit the control of the disease in 
both pigs and humans.
