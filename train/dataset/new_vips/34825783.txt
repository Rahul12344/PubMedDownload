Sustainable solutions on fabricating and using a face mask to block the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread during this
coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) are required as society is directed by
the World Health Organization (WHO) toward wearing it, resulting in an
increasingly huge demand with over 4 000 000 000 masks used per day globally.
Herein, various new mask technologies and advanced materials are reviewed to deal
with critical shortages, cross-infection, and secondary transmission risk of
masks. A number of countries have used cloth masks and 3D-printed masks as
substitutes, whose filtration efficiencies can be improved by using nanofibers or
mixing other polymers into them. Since 2020, researchers continue to improve the 
performance of masks by adding various functionalities, for example using metal
nanoparticles and herbal extracts to inactivate pathogens, using graphene to make
masks photothermal and superhydrophobic, and using triboelectric nanogenerator
(TENG) to prolong mask lifetime. The recent advances in material technology have 
led to the development of antimicrobial coatings, which are introduced in this
review. When incorporated into masks, these advanced materials and technologies
can aid in the prevention of secondary transmission of the virus.
