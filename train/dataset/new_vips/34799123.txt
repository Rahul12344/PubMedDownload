Antibody profile of pigs naturally infected with a virulent African swine fever
virus (ASFV) strain under field conditions was studied. Twenty-three serum
samples were collected from pigs surviving a natural ASFV infection: 17 samples
from finishing pigs (∼7 months old) and 6 samples from sows (between 12 and 36
months old). Additionally, 24 serum samples were collected from ASFV-naïve pigs
to serve as negative controls. All sera from ASFV-surviving pigs tested positive 
while all sera from control pigs tested negative by two different commercial
ELISA kits. Antibody reactivity of each serum sample was simultaneously measured 
against six selected ASFV antigens including p12, p32, p54, pp62, C-type lectin
and CD2v. All ASFV-surviving pigs had antibody against p32, p54 and pp62 while
91.3% surviving pigs had antibody against p12. Only small portions of
ASFV-surviving pigs exhibited antibodies against C-type lectin (34.8%) and CD2v
(26.1%). While antibodies against p12, p32, p54 and pp62 were similarly detected 
in both finishing pigs and sows, antibodies against C-type lectin and CD2v were
mainly detected in sows but not in finishing pigs. These results suggest a
differential humoral immune response to ASFV infection in sows and finishing
pigs. Further studies are needed to better understand the nature of immune
responses to ASFV infection in different pig populations.
