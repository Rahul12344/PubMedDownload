BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection despite being a vaccine preventable
disease remains a global public health problem. In Cameroon, the hepatitis B
vaccine was introduced in the expanded program on immunisation in 2005, but there
has been limited evaluation of the HBV surface antibody response post
vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in infants 
who received the DPT-Hep B-Hib vaccine, and we assessed HBsAg carriage in
non-responders. We also investigated factors associated with non-response or poor
response.
METHODS: Using a hospital based cross sectional design and a structured
questionnaire over a four-month period (January to April 2019), we collected data
to determine factors associated with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs)
response from infants aged 6 to 9 months attending infant welfare clinics (IWC)
at the Buea and Limbe regional hospitals. We collected venous blood and measured 
anti-HBs titres using a quantitative Foresight® ELISA. We entered and analysed
data using EpiData version 3.1 and SPSS version 25 respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 161 infants enrolled, 159 (98.8%) developed anti-HBs antibodies. 
Of these 159, 157 (97.5%) and 117 (72.7%) developed ≥ 10.0 mIU/ml
(seroprotection) and ≥ 100.0 mIU/ml anti-HBs titres respectively. Being younger
(6 months old) was associated with seroprotection (Cramer V = 0.322, p = 0.001). 
Spearman rho's relational analysis showed that immunity against HBV reduced as
the duration since the last dose increased (r = -0.172; P = 0.029). However, a
Firth logistic regression showed no significant association of factors with
inadequate immunity. All 12 (7.5%) infants exposed to HBV at birth, received the 
hepatitis B vaccine at birth, including four who received HBIG, and all were
protected. Four infants (2.5%) had anti-HBs titres < 10.0 mIU/mL (non-responders)
but had no peculiarity.
CONCLUSION: The seroprotective rate following hepatitis B vaccination of infants 
is high even in exposed infants. Our study suggests that Cameroon's HBV vaccine
in the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) is effective against HBV, although 
we could not account for the 2.5% non-response rate. Large scale studies are
needed to further explore non-response to the vaccine.
