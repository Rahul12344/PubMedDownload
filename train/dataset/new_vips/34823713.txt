A perfect storm of events to include the COVID-19 global pandemic and technologic
advances has led to the emergence of telemedicine in otolaryngology as a means to
deliver remote clinical services to patients in their home and other clinical
settings. There are benefits, such as increased safety and increased access to
care, but also challenges, such as need for advanced technology and familiarity
with computers. Telemedicine could play a greater role in otolaryngology in the
future with advances in smartphone and endoscopic technology allowing for more
detailed examination of patients.
