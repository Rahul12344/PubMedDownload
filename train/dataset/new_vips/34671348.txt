Objectives: In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the fast development of
vaccines with efficacy of around 95% preventing Covid-19 illness provides a
unique opportunity to reduce the mortality associated with the pandemic. However,
in the absence of efficacious prophylactic medications and few treatments for
this infection, the induction of a fast and robust protective immunity is
required for effective disease control, not only to prevent the disease but also 
the infection and shedding/transmission. The objective of our study was to
analyze the level of specific humoral and cellular T-cell responses against the
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced by two mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2 and
mRNA-1273), but also how long it takes after vaccination to induce these
protective humoral and cellular immune responses.
Methods: We studied in 40 healthy (not previously infected) volunteers vaccinated
with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines the presence of spike-specific IgG antibodies
and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells at 3, 7 and 14 days after receiving the second
dose of the vaccine. The specific T-cell response was analyzed stimulating fresh 
whole blood from vaccinated volunteers with SARS-CoV-2 peptides and measuring the
release of cytokines secreted by T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 stimulation.
Results: Our results indicate that the immunization capacity of both vaccines is 
comparable. However, although both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines can induce
early B-cell and T-cell responses, these vaccine-mediated immune responses do not
reach their maximum values until 14 days after completing the vaccination
schedule.
Conclusion: This refractory period in the induction of specific immunity observed
after completing the vaccination could constitute a window of higher infection
risk, which could explain some emerging cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
vaccinated people.
