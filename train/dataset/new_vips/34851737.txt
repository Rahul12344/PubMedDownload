In recent years, expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) has been
reported to play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection. Much effort has been focused to comprehend the mechanisms 
and factors that regulate the expansion of such unwanted immune cell populations.
Of particular interest has been the mechanisms by which MDSCs could contribute to
the pathogenesis of HIV infection. So far, the studies have been restricted to
MDSCs in the circulatory system of HIV patients, but not in other tissue
compartments. In fact, lymphatic tissues/organs are the primary sites where HIV
replication and immune depletion/dysfunction occur during the course of HIV
infection. Therefore, investigating the anatomical distribution of MDSCs in such 
compartments is essential to understand the role that they play in the
pathogenesis of HIV infection. Hence, we aim to shed light on the available
literature about the anatomical distribution of MDSCs during HIV infection and
compare it with the distribution of MDSCs in other pathological conditions,
mainly cancer.
