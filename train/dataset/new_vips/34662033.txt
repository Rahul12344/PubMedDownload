Monkeypox virus was first isolated and identified in 1958 when monkeys shipped
from Singapore to a Denmark research facility fell ill.[1] However, the first
confirmed human case was in 1970 when the virus was isolated from a child in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo suspected to have smallpox.[2]  Coincident immunity 
to monkeypox virus was previously achieved with vaccinia vaccination; however,
eradicating smallpox and subsequent lack of vaccination efforts paved the way for
monkeypox to gain clinical relevance.[3] Furthermore, because most cases of
monkeypox occur in rural Africa, suspected underreporting may translate to an
underestimation of the potential threat of this pathogen.[4]
