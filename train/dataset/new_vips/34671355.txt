Host innate immune response follows severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and it is the driver of the acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) amongst other inflammatory end-organ morbidities. Such
life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heralded by virus-induced
activation of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs; monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic 
cells). MPs play substantial roles in aberrant immune secretory activities
affecting profound systemic inflammation and end-organ malfunctions. All follow
the presence of persistent viral components and virions without evidence of viral
replication. To elucidate SARS-CoV-2-MP interactions we investigated
transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages.
While expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,
paralleled monocyte-macrophage differentiation, it failed to affect productive
viral infection. In contrast, simple macrophage viral exposure led to robust
pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression but attenuated type I
interferon (IFN) activity. Both paralleled dysregulation of innate immune
signaling pathways, specifically those linked to IFN. We conclude that the
SARS-CoV-2-infected host mounts a robust innate immune response characterized by 
a pro-inflammatory storm heralding end-organ tissue damage.
