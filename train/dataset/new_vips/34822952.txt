Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic agent mainly transmitted through the
consumption of uncooked or undercooked meat products derived from infected
animals. In Japan, domestic pigs and wild boars are the major animal reservoirs, 
and whether or not deer are an HEV reservoir remains controversial. We analyzed
395 serum and 199 liver samples from 405 sika deer (Cervus nippon) caught in the 
wild between 1997 and 2020 in 11 prefectures of Japan for markers of HEV
infection. Overall, 17 deer had anti-HEV IgG (4.3%), while 1 (0.2%) had HEV RNA
(genotype 3b), indicating the occurrence of ongoing HEV infection in wild deer in
Japan. An analysis of the complete HEV genome (deJOI_14) recovered from a viremic
deer in Oita Prefecture revealed only 88.8% identity with the first HEV strain in
sika deer (JDEER-Hyo03L) in Japan, being closest (96.3%) to the HEV obtained from
a hepatitis patient living in the same prefecture. Of note, the deJOI_14 strain
was 8.7-9.0% different from the wild boar HEV strains obtained in the same
habitat and the same year, suggesting that difference in infected HEV strains
between boar and deer may be explained by the limited possibility of close
contact with each other, although boars are a known source of HEV infection.
Increased numbers of hepatitis E cases after consumption of raw or undercooked
meat products of wild deer have been reported in Japan. These results suggest a
low but nonnegligible zoonotic risk of HEV infection in wild deer in this
country.
