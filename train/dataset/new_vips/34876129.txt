Pulmonary fibrosis is the end stage of a broad range of heterogeneous
interstitial lung diseases and more than 200 factors contribute to it. In recent 
years, the relationship between virus infection and pulmonary fibrosis is getting
more and more attention, especially after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019,
however, the mechanisms underlying the virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis are not
fully understood. Here, we review the relationship between pulmonary fibrosis and
several viruses such as Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
Murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), Influenza virus, Avian influenza virus, Middle 
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, Severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as the mechanisms underlying the virus
infection induced pulmonary fibrosis. This may shed new light on the potential
targets for anti-fibrotic therapy to treat pulmonary fibrosis induced by viruses 
including SARS-CoV-2.
