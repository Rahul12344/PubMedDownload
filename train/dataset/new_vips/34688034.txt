BACKGROUND: Highly efficacious vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed. However, the emergence of viral
variants that are more infectious than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is
concerning. Several of these viral variants have the potential to partially
escape neutralizing antibody responses, warranting continued immune-monitoring.
METHODS: We used a panel of 30 post-mRNA vaccination sera to determine
neutralization and RBD and spike binding activity against a number of emerging
viral variants. The virus neutralization was determined using authentic
SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in an assay format that mimics physiological
conditions.
FINDINGS: We tested seven currently circulating viral variants of
concern/interest, including the three Iota sublineages, Alpha (E484K), Beta,
Delta and Lambda in neutralization assays. We found only small decreases in
neutralization against Iota and Delta. The reduction was stronger against a
sub-variant of Lambda, followed by Beta and Alpha (E484K). Lambda is currently
circulating in parts of Latin America and was detected in Germany, the US and
Israel. Of note, reduction in a receptor binding domain and spike binding assay
that also included Gamma, Kappa and A.23.1 was negligible.
INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these findings suggest that mRNA SARS-CoV-2
vaccines may remain effective against these viral variants of concern/interest
and that spike binding antibody tests likely retain specificity in the face of
evolving SARS-CoV-2 diversity.

Conflict of interest statement: Declaration of Competing Interest The Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to
SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list
Florian Krammer as co-inventor. Viviana Simon and Fatima Amanat are also listed
on the serological assay patent application as co-inventors. Mount Sinai has spun
out a company, Kantaro, to market serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. Florian
Krammer has consulted for Merck and Pfizer (before 2020), and is currently
consulting for Pfizer, Seqirus and Avimex. The Krammer laboratory is also
collaborating with Pfizer on animal models of SARS-CoV-2.
