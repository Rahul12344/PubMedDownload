Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving concept that has been given the tag
"fifth pillar" of cancer therapy while radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery
and targeted therapy remain the other four pillars. This involves the stimulation
of the immune system to control tumor growth and it specifically targets the
neoplastic cells rather than the normal cells. Conventional chemotherapy has many
limitations which include drug resistance, recurrence of cancer and severe
adverse effects. Immunology has made major treatment breakthroughs for several
cancers such as colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer,
liver cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia etc.
Currently, therapeutic strategies harnessing the immune system involve Checkpoint
inhibitors, Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells), Monoclonal
antibodies, Cancer vaccines, Cytokines, Radio-immunotherapy and Oncolytic virus
therapy. The molecular characterization of several tumor antigens (TA) indicates 
that these TA can be utilized as promising candidates in cancer immunotherapy
strategies. Here in this review, we highlight and summarize the different
categories of emerging cancer immunotherapies along with the immunologically
recognized tumor antigens involved in the tumor microenvironment.
