The article is an attempt to provide a kaleidoscopic interpretation of how social
science scholarship views the socio-cultural terrain of Zimbabwe during and after
the global health crisis, and the societal and business haemorrhage induced by
the coronavirus (COVID-19). Built through a multi-perspective and triangulation
involving a modified Delphic approach that engages archival methods involving
document and literature review, content analysis and expert interpretation; the
article unveils the various effects of COVID-19 on Zimbabwe. It is concluded that
COVID-19 by its nature is disruptive to everyday life, restrictive to
human-social relations and is an instigator to tradition, spirituality and
intellectuality in the country. The challenge of the virus brings to society a
deliberate consciousness that global processes and events are converging (borders
are porous) while local embeddedness is being entrenched through practices like
lockdowns and confinement.
