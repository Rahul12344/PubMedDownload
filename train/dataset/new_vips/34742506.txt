BACKGROUND: Online teaching has expanded over the past few decades, particularly 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, characteristics of online teaching
effectiveness and quality remain understudied.
PURPOSE: This study examined perceptions of online teaching effectiveness from
nursing faculty and student perspectives.
METHODS: The findings presented are from phase 1 of a three-phase, mixed methods 
research project. In this phase, a qualitative descriptive design was used to
analyze data obtained from focus group interview sessions. A purposive sampling
of faculty (N = 15) and students (N = 17) from one midwestern, public university 
participated in five focus groups.
RESULTS: Seven themes emerged through qualitative data analysis of faculty focus 
group data. Student focus groups yielded six themes. Faculty and students
identified challenges and strategies for effective online teaching. Student and
faculty perceptions of online teaching effectiveness aligned for many themes.
CONCLUSION: Study findings have distinct implications for nursing education.
Identifying the characteristics of online teaching effectiveness provides the
foundation for establishing tangible constructs and robust evaluation, broadening
the impact on learning outcomes, faculty development, and educational practice.
