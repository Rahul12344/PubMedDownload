Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is the leading cause of genital
lesions. Infrequently HSV-2 primary infection can spread and involve other tissue
and organs, however in immunocompetent individuals extra-genital complications
are rare findings. In this report we present a fatal case of fulminant
myocarditis and terminal liver involvement, caused by HSV-2 infection, with a
unique presentation. Diagnosis was made only post-mortem.
