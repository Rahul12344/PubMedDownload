Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly contagious severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become the worst pandemic
disease of the current millennium. To address this crisis, therapeutic
nanoparticles, including inorganic nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, polymeric 
nanoparticles, virus-like nanoparticles, and cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, 
have all offered compelling antiviral strategies. This article reviews these
strategies in three categories: (1) nanoparticle-enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2,
(2) nanoparticle-based treatment for COVID-19, and (3) nanoparticle vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how nanoparticles are tailor-made to biointerface 
with the host and the virus in each category. For each nanoparticle design, we
highlight its structure-function relationship that enables effective antiviral
activity. Overall, nanoparticles bring numerous new opportunities to improve our 
response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and enhance our preparedness for future
viral outbreaks.
