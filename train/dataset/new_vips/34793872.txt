In 2020, to trace the prevalence and evolution of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in
China, a total of 1383 samples (1016 fecal samples and 367 nasal swab samples)
were collected from 1016 cattle exhibiting diarrhea symptoms on dairy farms and
beef cattle farms in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. All samples were
subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection
of the BCoV N gene, followed by an analysis of its epidemiology and genetic
evolution. The results indicated that of the 1016 diarrhea-affected cattle,
15.45% (157/1016) were positive for BCoV, in which positive rates of the fecal
and nasal swab samples were 12.20% (124/1016) and 21.53% (79/367), respectively. 
Of the 367 cattle whose nasal swab samples were collected, the BCoV positive rate
of the corresponding fecal samples was 15.26% (56/367). BCoV infection was
significantly associated with age, farming pattern, cattle type, farm latitude,
sample type, and clinical symptom (p < 0.05). Of the 203 BCoV-positive samples,
20 spike (S) genes were successfully sequenced. The 20 identified BCoV strains
shared nucleotide homologies of 97.7-100.0%, and their N-terminal domain of S1
subunit (S1-NTD: residues 15-298) differed genetically from the reference strains
of South Korea and Europe. The 20 identified BCoV strains were clustered in the
Asia-North America group (GII group) in the global strain-based phylogenetic tree
and formed three clades in the Chinese strain-based phylogenetic tree. The
HLJ/HH-10/2020 strain was clustered into the Europe group (GI group) in the
S1-NTD-based phylogenetic tree, exhibiting N146/I, D148/G, and L154/F mutations
that affect the S protein structure. Of the identified BCoV strains, one
potential recombination event occurred between the HLJ/HH-20/2020 and
HLJ/HH-10/2020 strains, which led to the generation of the recombinant BCV-AKS-01
strain. A selective pressure analysis on the S protein revealed one positively
selected site (Asn509) among the 20 identified BCoV strains located inside the
putative receptor binding domain (residues 326-540). These data provide a greater
understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of BCoV in China.
