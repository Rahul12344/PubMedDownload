Societal crises and personal challenges are often followed by substantial changes
in physical activity. Is there a link between such changes and psychological
well-being? Seeking to answer this question, we conducted a correlational study
on a representative sample in Sweden during the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic (N = 1035). About 49% of the sample had decreased their physical
activity compared to their self-reported activity level prior to the pandemic,
whereas 32% had increased it. The results showed a positive and robust
association between changes in daily activity level and corresponding changes in 
psychological well-being. Specifically, individuals who had reduced their
physical activity over the last year reported lower life satisfaction than
before, and individuals who had increased their physical activity reported higher
life satisfaction than before. The amount of complete physical inactivity
(sitting) showed a similar pattern as the exercise data, meaning that individuals
who reported increasing inactivity per day also reported a greater decline in
life satisfaction. Additional analyses showed that the association between daily 
activity level and life satisfaction was somewhat stronger for men than for
women, but there was no difference when comparing individual versus organized
activities. The current study was based on a cross-sectional design, measuring
self-reported change over time. Recent work from other research teams have used
longitudinal data and experience-sampling in different settings, finding similar 
results. We conclude that there is good reason to recommend physical exercise as 
a coping strategy in difficult times.
