OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the eicosanoid and pro resolutive
parameters in SARS COVID-19 patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen male patients with an acute respiratory syndrome
caused by SARS COVID-19 and four healthy controls were evaluated by measuring the
following parameters in plasma: Polyunsaturated fatty acids: EPA, DHA, ARA, and
DPA. Specialized Pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (including monohydroxy-containing
precursors 17-HDHA, 18-HEPE, 14-HDHA) resolvins, maresins, protectins, and
lipoxins. The eicosanoids group included prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and
leukotrienes.
RESULTS: Plasma from COVID-19 patients presented higher amounts of
pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic lipid mediators as compared to healthy
subjects (65.7 pg/ml vs. 10.2 pg/ml), including thromboxane (2142.6 pg/ml vs.
10.4 pg/ml), and the ratio between total plasma pro-inflammatory mediators versus
total SPM's was 13.2 to 0,4, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A clear disbalance favoring the pro-inflammatory axis is described, 
showing the need to perform future clinical interventions in these patients using
SPM's or monohydroxylated lipid mediators derivates from fatty acids.
