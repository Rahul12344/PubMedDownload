BACKGROUND: Medical students experience high levels of psychological stress
during clinical training. However, most medical curricula do not teach self-care 
skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical education causing increased
distress among students.
AIM: To report the implementation and impact of an eight-week multifaceted
mindfulness-based self-care program on medical students' distress and well-being 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-three fourth-year medical students
attended the program as part of a mandatory course from April to May 2020, during
the rising phase of COVID-19 in Chile. They were evaluated using validated tests 
before and immediately after the program. The measures included burnout,
dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, traumatic stress reactions, general 
well-being, resilience, and stress coping strategies.
RESULTS: Burnout prevalence decreased from 48% to 24%, whereas students with high
dispositional mindfulness increased from 25% to 44%. Burnout reduction was mostly
due to decreased emotional exhaustion. Additionally, students reported lower
levels of stress, self-blaming, and traumatic stress reactions alongside an
increased use of active coping strategies and resilience levels after the
program.
CONCLUSIONS: A formal educational intervention, teaching self-awareness and
self-regulation skills can help reduce medical students' distress and promote
their well-being even amidst a pandemic.
