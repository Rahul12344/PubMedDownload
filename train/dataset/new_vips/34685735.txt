The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in a wide series of
physiological processes, among which inflammation and blood pressure regulation. 
One of its key components, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, has been
identified as the entry point of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the host cells, and
therefore a lot of research has been devoted to study RAS dysregulation in
COVID-19. Here we discuss the alterations of the regulatory RAS axes due to
SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of a series of recent clinical investigations
and experimental analyzes quantifying, e.g., the levels and activity of RAS
components. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of these data in view of
disentangling the links between the impaired RAS functioning and the
pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19. We also review the effects of
several RAS-targeting drugs and how they could potentially help restore the
normal RAS functionality and minimize the COVID-19 severity. Finally, we discuss 
the conflicting evidence found in the literature and the open questions on RAS
dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection whose resolution would improve our
understanding of COVID-19.
