INTRODUCTION: As of 26 March 2021, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention had reported 4 159 055 cases of COVID-19 and 111 357 deaths among the 
55 African Union member states; however, no country has published a nationally
representative serosurvey as of October 2021. Such data are vital for
understanding the pandemic's progression on the continent, evaluating containment
measures, and policy planning.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, nationally representative,
age-stratified serosurvey in Sierra Leone in March 2021 by randomly selecting 120
Enumeration Areas throughout the country and 10 randomly selected households in
each of these. One to two persons per selected household were interviewed to
collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19,
exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 
illness. Capillary blood was collected by fingerstick, and blood samples were
tested using the Hangzhou Biotest Biotech RightSign COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test
Cassette. Total seroprevalence was estimated after applying sampling weights.
RESULTS: The overall weighted seroprevalence was 2.6% (95% CI 1.9% to 3.4%). This
was 43 times higher than the reported number of cases. Rural seropositivity was
1.8% (95% CI 1.0% to 2.5%), and urban seropositivity was 4.2% (95% CI 2.6% to
5.7%).
DISCUSSION: Overall seroprevalence was low compared with countries in Europe and 
the Americas (suggesting relatively successful containment in Sierra Leone). This
has ramifications for the country's third wave (which started in June 2021),
during which the average number of daily reported cases was 87 by the end of the 
month:this could potentially be on the order of 3700 actual infections per day,
calling for stronger containment measures in a country with only 0.2% of people
fully vaccinated. It may also reflect significant under-reporting of incidence
and mortality across the continent.
