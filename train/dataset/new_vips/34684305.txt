BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become one of the leading
causes of death worldwide. The impact of poor nutritional status on increased
mortality and prolonged ICU (intensive care unit) stay in critically ill patients
is well-documented. This study aims to assess how nutritional status and BMI
(body mass index) affected in-hospital mortality in critically ill COVID-19
patients Methods: We conducted a retrospective study and analysed medical records
of 286 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the University
Clinical Hospital in Wroclaw (Poland).
RESULTS: A total of 286 patients were analysed. In the sample group, 8% of
patients who died had a BMI within the normal range, 46% were overweight, and 46%
were obese. There was a statistically significantly higher death rate in men
(73%) and those with BMIs between 25.0-29.9 (p = 0.011). Nonsurvivors had a
statistically significantly higher HF (Heart Failure) rate (p = 0.037) and HT
(hypertension) rate (p < 0.001). Furthermore, nonsurvivors were statistically
significantly older (p < 0.001). The risk of death was higher in overweight
patients (HR = 2.13; p = 0.038). Mortality was influenced by higher scores in
parameters such as age (HR = 1.03; p = 0.001), NRS2002 (nutritional risk score,
HR = 1.18; p = 0.019), PCT (procalcitonin, HR = 1.10; p < 0.001) and potassium
level (HR = 1.40; p = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: Being overweight in critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring
invasive mechanical ventilation increases their risk of death significantly.
Additional factors indicating a higher risk of death include the patient's age,
high PCT, potassium levels, and NRS ≥ 3 measured at the time of admission to the 
ICU.
