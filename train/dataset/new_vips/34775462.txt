BACKGROUND Little is known of the changes in lung radiographic characteristics
over time in patients recovering from COVID-19. This study analyzed the clinical 
features and temporal lung radiographic changes in patients with moderate and
severe COVID-19 pneumonia who did not require invasive mechanical ventilation
during the acute and convalescent periods. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 25
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 29, 2020, to November 24, 2020, who
did not require invasive mechanical ventilation and who were followed up were
retrospectively collected. The 25 patients were divided into severe and moderate 
groups. Clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) manifestations were
compared. A total of 121 consecutive thin-slice CT scans were collected at 4
weeks, 2 months, and 5 months after admission to evaluate lung abnormalities in
the patients. The CT score was used to assess disease severity. RESULTS The
severe group had a lower rate of nucleic acid conversion within 10 days of
admission and higher D-dimer, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase values. 
In the severe group, hospital stay was longer and hospitalization costs were
higher. The average CT score of the severe group peaked in the second week, while
the moderate group peaked in the first week and then decreased over time. There
were no statistically significant differences in the average CT score between the
2 groups at the 5-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The pulmonary lesions of patients 
recovering from COVID-19 and who do not require invasive mechanical ventilation
were gradually absorbed and resolved over time.
