The four mosquito-borne dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-DENV4) cause a high burden 
of disease throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.
Nevertheless, their precise epidemiological history in Africa, including when and
where they originated and were distributed during the 20th century, remains
unclear stressing the need for One Health focused research. Accordingly, we
conducted a time-scaled molecular epidemiological reconstruction using publicly
available and newly sequenced dengue virus genomes of African origin representing
all four serotypes to deduce the most likely temporal and spatial transmission
routes of each DENV serotype from their ancestral regions to, within and from
Africa. Our analyses suggest that during the 20th century, serotypes DENV1-DENV3 
were introduced to Africa from South East Asia on multiple occasions. The
earliest evidence recorded indicates introduction of DENV2 during the early-1940s
and of DENV1 during the mid-1940s to Western Africa from South East Asia. The
analysis also implies an early introduction of DENV4 during the mid-1940s to
Western Africa, alongside DENV1, probably originating in South East Asia.
Establishment of DENV3 in Africa appears to have occurred later in the 1960s,
apparently originating from South East Asia. However, with the re-establishment
of DENV in the Americas, following the cessation of the PAHO mosquito control
programme during the mid-20th century, evidence of introductions of DENV1 and
DENV2 from the Americas to Western Africa was also observed. The data also
identify intra-regional circulation of DENV, but also inter-regional dispersal of
all four serotypes within Africa, which has led to a high degree of geographical 
overlap among serotypes. It is also noteworthy that DENV from both Eastern and
Western Africa, have been introduced into Central Africa but there is no support 
for the converse relationship. For serotypes DENV1-DENV3, we observed probable
exports from within established African DENV clusters (≥2 sequences) primarily to
Eastern and Southern Asia. Collectively, our findings support the view that all
DENV serotypes, apart from DENV4, have been introduced on multiple occasions to
Africa, primarily originating from South East Asia, and subsequently to
neighbouring regions within Africa.
