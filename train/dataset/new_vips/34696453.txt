Laryngeal papilloma (LP), which is associated with infection by human
papillomavirus (HPV)-6 or -11, displays aggressive growth. The precise molecular 
mechanism underlying the tumorigenesis of LP has yet to be uncovered. Building on
our earlier research into HPV-6, in this study, the viral gene expression of
HPV-11 was investigated by quantitative PCR and DNA/RNA in situ hybridization.
Additionally, newly developed antibodies against the E4 protein of HPV-6 and
HPV-11 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The average viral load of HPV-11
in LP was 1.95 ± 0.66 × 105 copies/ng DNA, and 88% of HPV mRNA expression was
found to be E4, E5a, and E5b mRNAs. According to RNA in situ hybridization, E4
and E5b mRNAs were expressed from the middle to upper part of the epithelium. E4 
immunohistochemistry revealed a wide positive reaction in the upper cell layer in
line with E4 mRNA expression. Other head and neck lesions with HPV-11 infection
also showed a positive reaction in E4 immunohistochemistry. The distribution
pattern of HPV DNA, viral mRNA, and E4 protein in LP with HPV-11 infection was
quite similar to that of HPV-6. Therefore, it might be possible to apply these
E4-specific antibodies in other functional studies as well as clinical
applications, including targeted molecular therapies in patients with HPV-6 and
HPV-11 infection.
