Bain H circuit is an innovatively modified breathing circuit designed for the
transportation and resuscitation of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
For this circuit, the Heidbrink valve was replaced with a 15F inlet and 15M/22F
outlet adjustable pressure-limiting (APL) valve, and a high-efficiency
particulate air filter was placed over the APL outlet valve. The circuit is
designed to filter the novel coronavirus without any increase in dead space or
resistance. All benefits of the conventional Bain circuit were retained. Besides 
its use in dedicated COVID-19 areas, this circuit can be used in other emergency 
units of the hospital.
