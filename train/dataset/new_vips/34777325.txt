The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. Viruses have
evolved multiple mechanisms to escape host immune surveillance, which has been
explored extensively for human DNA viruses. There is growing evidence showing the
interaction between avian DNA viruses and the host innate immune system. In this 
review, we will survey the present knowledge of chicken DNA viruses, then
describe the functions of DNA sensors in avian innate immunity, and finally
discuss recent progresses in chicken DNA virus evasion from host innate immune
responses.
