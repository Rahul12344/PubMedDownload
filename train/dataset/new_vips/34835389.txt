Since its first detection in 1979, dengue fever has been considered a major
public health issue in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Dengue virus
(DENV) serotype 1 was the cause of an epidemic in 2010-2011. Between 2012 and
2020, major outbreaks due successively to DENV-3, DENV-4 and recently DENV-2 have
been recorded. However, DENV-1 still co-circulated in the country over this
period. Here, we summarize epidemiological and molecular data of DENV-1 between
2016 and 2020 in the Lao PDR. Our data highlight the continuous circulation of
DENV-1 in the country at levels ranging from 16% to 22% among serotyping tests.
In addition, the phylogenetic analysis has revealed the circulation of DENV-1
genotype I at least since 2008 with a co-circulation of different clusters.
Sequence data support independent DENV-1 introductions in the Lao PDR correlated 
with an active circulation of this serotype at the regional level in Southeast
Asia. The maintenance of DENV-1 circulation over the last ten years supports a
low level of immunity against this serotype within the Lao population. Thereby,
the risk of a DENV-1 epidemic cannot be ruled out in the future, and this
emphasizes the importance of maintaining an integrated surveillance approach to
prevent major outbreaks.
