OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the effects of different physical
activities practised during the time period when COVID-19 social distancing
measures were in place on the risk of subjective memory decline in adults.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Data from the Prospective Study about Mental and Physical Health
(PAMPA), a state-level (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), online-based cohort study,
were analysed. Respondents were asked to rate their memory before COVID-19 social
distancing measures were implemented (retrospectively) and on the day that the
survey was completed. Subjective memory decline was defined as a perceived
worsening of memory function during COVID-19 social distancing compared with the 
pre-pandemic period. The types of physical activity practised before and during
COVID-19 social distancing measures were assessed.
RESULTS: Data from 2319 adults were included. Out-of-home endurance, muscle
strengthening, combined endurance and muscle strengthening, and stretching
activities reduced the risk of subjective memory decline during the pandemic. In 
terms of physical activities practised at home, only muscle strengthening did not
protect against subjective memory decline. Participants who sustained any type of
physical activity at home during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a reduced risk for 
subjective memory decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity, regardless of the type of activity and location
performed, during the time period when COVID-19 social distancing measures were
in place can mitigate the effects of the pandemic on subjective memory decline.
