Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a disease caused by
infection with the SFTS virus (SFTSV). SFTS has become a crucial public health
concern because of the heavy burden, lack of vaccines, effective therapies, and
high-fatality rate. Evidence suggests that SFTSV circulates between ticks and
animals in nature and is transmitted to humans by tick bites. In particular,
ticks have been implicated as vectors of SFTSV, where domestic or wild animals
may play as the amplifying hosts. Many studies have identified antigens and
antibodies against SFTSV in various animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, and
rodents. Besides, person-to-person transmission through contact with blood or
mucous of an infected person has also been reported. In this study, we reviewed
the literature and summarized the vectors and hosts associated with SFTS and the 
possible risk factors.
