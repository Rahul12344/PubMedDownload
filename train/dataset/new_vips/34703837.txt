X-linked inherited ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is the most
common disorder affecting the liver-based urea cycle, a pathway enabling
detoxification of nitrogen waste and endogenous arginine biosynthesis. Patients
develop acute hyperammonemia leading to neurological sequelae or death despite
the best-accepted therapy based on ammonia scavengers and protein-restricted
diet. Liver transplantation is curative but associated with procedure-related
complications and lifelong immunosuppression. Adeno-associated viral (AAV)
vectors have demonstrated safety and clinical benefits in a rapidly growing
number of clinical trials for inherited metabolic liver diseases. Engineered AAV 
capsids have shown promising enhanced liver tropism. Here, we conducted a
good-laboratory practice-compliant investigational new drug-enabling study to
assess the safety of intravenous liver-tropic AAVLK03 gene transfer of a human
codon-optimized OTC gene. Juvenile cynomolgus monkeys received vehicle and a low 
and high dose of vector (2 × 1012 and 2 × 1013 vector genome (vg)/kg,
respectively) and were monitored for 26 weeks for in-life safety with sequential 
liver biopsies at 1 and 13 weeks post-vector administration. Upon completion of
monitoring, animals were euthanized to study vector biodistribution, immune
responses, and histopathology. The product was well tolerated with no adverse
clinical events, predominant hepatic biodistribution, and sustained
supra-physiological OTC overexpression. This study supports the clinical
deployment of intravenous AAVLK03 for severe OTCD.
