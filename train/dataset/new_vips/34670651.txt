We describe characteristics associated with having coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
among students residing on a university campus. Of 2,187 students, 528 (24.1%)
received a COVID-19 diagnosis during fall semester 2020. Students sharing a
bedroom or suite had approximately twice the odds of contracting COVID-19 as
those living alone.
