Public health events, as the common concern faced by the international community,
call for the joint response from all mankind. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has
highlighted the problems confronting the global governance of international
public health, such as limited functions of international organizations and
difficulties in achieving objectives, poor collaboration between governance
subjects and their limited performance, overlapping legal basis of governance and
blurred core function, and lack of solutions to special problems. The
corresponding approaches can be taken to improve the efficiency of the governance
of global public health, including supporting the role of international
organizations to achieve the objectives, enhancing coordination among
international governance subjects to form synergy, promoting the compliance with 
IHR2005 to avoid conflict of law application and upholding the vision of a
community with a shared future for mankind to jointly respond to the special
problems.
