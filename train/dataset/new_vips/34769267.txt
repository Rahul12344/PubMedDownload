Protopanaxadiol (PPD), an aglycon found in several dammarene-type ginsenosides,
has high potency as a pharmaceutical. Nevertheless, application of these
ginsenosides has been limited because of the high production cost due to the rare
content of PPD in Panax ginseng and a long cultivation time (4-6 years). For the 
biological mass production of the PPD, de novo biosynthetic pathways for PPD were
introduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the metabolic flux toward the target
molecule was restructured to avoid competition for carbon sources between native 
metabolic pathways and de novo biosynthetic pathways producing PPD in S.
cerevisiae. Here, we report a CRISPRi (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats interference)-based customized metabolic flux system which
downregulates the lanosterol (a competing metabolite of dammarenediol-II (DD-II))
synthase in S. cerevisiae. With the CRISPRi-mediated suppression of lanosterol
synthase and diversion of lanosterol to DD-II and PPD in S. cerevisiae, we
increased PPD production 14.4-fold in shake-flask fermentation and 5.7-fold in a 
long-term batch-fed fermentation.
