Dengue fever is a dangerous infectious endemic disease that affects over 100
nations worldwide, from Africa to the Western Pacific, and is caused by the
dengue virus, which is transmitted to humans by an insect bite of Aedes aegypti. 
Millions of citizens have died as a result of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic
fever across the globe. Envelope (E), serine protease (NS3), RNA-directed RNA
polymerase (NS5), and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) are mostly required for cell
proliferation and survival. Some of the diterpenoids and their derivatives
produced by nature possess anti-dengue viral properties. The goal of the
computational study was to scrutinize the effectiveness of diterpenoids and their
derivatives against dengue viral proteins through in silico study. Methods:
molecular docking was performed to analyze the binding affinity of compounds
against four viral proteins: the envelope (E) protein, the NS1 protein, the NS3
protein, and the NS5 protein. Results: among the selected drug candidates,
triptolide, stevioside, alepterolic acid, sphaeropsidin A, methyl dodovisate A,
andrographolide, caesalacetal, and pyrimethamine have demonstrated moderate to
good binding affinities (-8.0 to -9.4 kcal/mol) toward the selected proteins: E
protein, NS3, NS5, and NS1 whereas pyrimethamine exerts -7.5, -6.3, -7.8, and
-6.6 kcal/mol with viral proteins, respectively. Interestingly, the binding
affinities of these lead compounds were better than those of an FDA-approved
anti-viral medication (pyrimethamine), which is underused in dengue fever.
Conclusion: we can conclude that diterpenoids can be considered as a possible
anti-dengue medication option. However, in vivo investigation is recommended to
back up the conclusions of this study.
