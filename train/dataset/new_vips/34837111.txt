Geminiviruses are plant-infecting, circular single-stranded DNA viruses that have
a geminate virion morphology. These viruses infect both cultivated and
non-cultivated monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and have a wide
geographical distribution. Nine genera had been established within the family
Geminiviridae (Becurtovirus, Begomovirus, Capulavirus, Curtovirus, Eragrovirus,
Grablovirus, Mastrevirus, Topocuvirus, and Turncurtovirus) as of 2020. In the
last decade, metagenomics approaches have facilitated the discovery and
identification of many novel viruses, among them numerous highly divergent
geminiviruses. Here, we report the establishment of five new genera in the family
Geminiviridae (Citlodavirus, Maldovirus, Mulcrilevirus, Opunvirus, and
Topilevirus) to formally classify twelve new, divergent geminiviruses.
