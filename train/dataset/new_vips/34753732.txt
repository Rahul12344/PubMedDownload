Subacute thyroiditis following vaccination is an uncommon presentation of
thyrotoxicosis. As the world undertakes its largest immunisation campaign to date
in an attempt to protect the population from COVID-19 infections, an increasing
number of rare post vaccine side effects are being observed. We report a case of 
a middle-aged woman who presented with painful thyroid swelling following the
second dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) with
clinical, biochemical and imaging features consistent with destructive
thyrotoxicosis. Symptomatic management only was required for the self-limiting
episode. Thyroiditis typically has a mild and self-limiting course and thus this 
observation should not deter people from vaccination, as COVID-19 infection has a
far greater morbidity and mortality risk than thyroiditis.
