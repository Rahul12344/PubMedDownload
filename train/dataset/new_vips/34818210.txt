BACKGROUND: eHealth applications have been recognized as a valuable tool to
reduce COVID-19's effective reproduction number. The factors that determine
acceptance of COVID-19 apps are unknown. The exception here is privacy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to identify antecedents of acceptance of
1) a mobile application for COVID-19 symptom recognition and monitoring, and 2) a
mobile application for contact tracing, both by means of an online survey among
Dutch citizens.
METHODS: Next to the demographics, the online survey contained questions focusing
on perceived health, fear of COVID-19 and intention to use. We used snowball
sampling via posts on social media and personal connections. To identify
antecedents of the model for acceptance of the two mobile applications we
conducted multiple linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: In total, 238 Dutch adults completed the survey. Almost 60% of the
responders were female and the average age was 45.6 years (SDÂ±17.4). For the
symptom app, the final model included the predictors age, attitude towards
technology and fear of COVID-19. The model had an r2 of 0.141. The final model
for the tracing app included the same predictors and had an r2 of 0.156. The main
reason to use both mobile applications was to control the spread of the COVID-19 
virus. Concerns about privacy was mentioned as the main reason not to use the
mobile applications.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, attitude towards technology and fear of COVID-19 are important 
predictors of the acceptance of COVID-19 mobile applications for symptom
recognition and monitoring and for contact tracing. These predictors should be
taken into account during the development and implementation of these mobile
applications to secure acceptance.
