Unbiased genetic forward screening using retroviral insertional mutagenesis in a 
genetically engineered mouse model of human multiple myeloma may further our
understanding of the genetic pathways that govern neoplastic plasma cell
development. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed a tumor induction study in
MYC-transgenic mice infected as neonates with the Moloney-derived murine leukemia
virus, MOL4070LTR. Next-generation DNA sequencing of proviral genomic integration
sites yielded rank-ordered candidate tumor progression genes that accelerated
plasma cell neoplasia in mice. Rigorous clinical and biological validation of
these genes led to the discovery of two novel myeloma genes: WDR26 (WD
repeat-containing protein 26) and MTF2 (metal response element binding
transcription factor 2). WDR26, a core component of the carboxy-terminal to LisH 
(CTLH) complex, is overexpressed or mutated in solid cancers. MTF2, an ancillary 
subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is a close functional
relative of PHD finger protein 19 (PHF19) which is currently emerging as an
important driver of myeloma. These findings underline the utility of genetic
forward screens in mice for uncovering novel blood cancer genes and suggest that 
WDR26-CTLH and MTF2-PRC2 are promising molecular targets for new approaches to
myeloma treatment and prevention.
