Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) often accompanies a short RNA molecule called a
satellite RNA (satRNA). When infected with CMV in the presence of Y-satellite RNA
(Y-sat), tobacco leaves develop a green mosaic, then turn yellow. Y-sat has been 
identified in the fields in Japan. Here, we show that the yellow leaf colour
preferentially attracts aphids, and that the aphids fed on yellow plants, which
harbour Y-sat-derived small RNAs (sRNAs), turn red and subsequently develop
wings. In addition, we found that leaf yellowing did not necessarily reduce
photosynthesis, and that viral transmission was not greatly affected despite the 
low viral titer in the Y-sat-infected plants. Y-sat-infected plants can therefore
support a sufficient number of aphids to allow for efficient virus transmission. 
Our results demonstrate that Y-sat directly alters aphid physiology via Y-sat
sRNAs to promote wing formation, an unprecedented survival strategy that enables 
outward spread via the winged insect vector.
