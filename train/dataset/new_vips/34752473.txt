BACKGROUND: Infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 and their mitigation
measures can exacerbate underlying gender disparities, particularly among
adolescents and young adults in densely populated urban settings.
METHODS: An existing cohort of youth ages 16-26 in Nairobi, Kenya completed a
phone-based survey in August-October 2020 (n = 1217), supplemented by virtual
focus group discussions and interviews with youth and stakeholders, to examine
economic, health, social, and safety experiences during COVID-19, and gender
disparities therein.
RESULTS: COVID-19 risk perception was high with a gender differential favoring
young women (95.5% vs. 84.2%; p<0.001); youth described mixed concern and
challenges to prevention. During COVID-19, gender symmetry was observed in
constrained access to contraception among contraceptive users (40.4% men; 34.6%
women) and depressive symptoms (21.8% men; 24.3% women). Gender disparities
rendered young women disproportionately unable to meet basic economic needs
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21; p<0.05) and in need of healthcare during the
pandemic (aOR = 1.59; p<0.001). At a bivariate level, women had lower full
decisional control to leave the house (40.0% vs. 53.2%) and less consistent
access to safe, private internet (26.1% vs. 40.2%), while men disproportionately 
experienced police interactions (60.1%, 55.2% of which included extortion).
Gender-specific concerns for women included menstrual hygiene access challenges
(52.0%), increased reliance on transactional partnerships, and gender-based
violence, with 17.3% reporting past-year partner violence and 3.0% non-partner
sexual violence. Qualitative results contextualize the mental health impact of
economic disruption and isolation, and, among young women, privacy constraints.
IMPLICATIONS: Youth and young adults face gendered impacts of COVID-19,
reflecting both underlying disparities and the pandemic's economic and social
shock. Economic, health and technology-based supports must ensure equitable
access for young women. Gender-responsive recovery efforts are necessary and must
address the unique needs of youth.
