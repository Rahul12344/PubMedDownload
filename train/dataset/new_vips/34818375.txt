OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the biomarkers and mechanisms for
dermatomyositis (DM) progression at the transcriptome level through a combination
of microarray and bioinformatic analyses.
METHOD: Microarray datasets for skeletal muscle of DM and healthy control (HC)
were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using GEO2R. Enrichment 
analyses were performed to understand the functions and enriched pathways of
DEGs. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify hub
genes. The top 10 hub genes were validated by other GEO datasets. The diagnostic 
accuracy of the top 10 hub genes for DM was evaluated using the area under the
curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULT: A total of 63 DEGs were identified between 10 DM samples and 9 HC
samples. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment
analysis indicated that DEGs are mostly enriched in response to virus, defense
response to virus, and type I interferon signaling pathway. 10 hub genes and 3
gene cluster modules were identified by Cytoscape. The identified hub genes were 
verified by GSE1551 and GSE11971 datasets and proven to be potential biomarkers
for the diagnosis of DM.
CONCLUSION: Our work identified 10 valuable genes as potential biomarkers for the
diagnosis of DM and explored the potential underlying molecular mechanism of the 
disease.
