Although all European countries have vaccination policies for children, there are
no comprehensive studies of pediatric vaccination programs in Europe. We studied 
vaccination programs for children in Europe. Vaccinations against diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B,
measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza existed in 42 countries, against human
papilloma virus in 41 countries, and against pneumococcus in 40 countries. In
addition, the following vaccinations existed: against tuberculosis (35
countries), hepatitis A (33), meningococcus A, C, W, Y (30), rotavirus and
varicella (28 countries each), meningococcus B (24), tick-born encephalitis (22),
and meningococcus C (16). Mandatory vaccinations are implemented in 21 countries,
mainly against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, H. influenzae type 
b, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis, and pneumococcus. There
are significant differences among pediatric vaccination programs in Europe
regarding number, schedules, indications, and regulatory frame (recommended or
mandatory vaccinations). A consensus-based vaccination program for all children
is needed.
