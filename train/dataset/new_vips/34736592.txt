Hepatitis C in children is on the rise due to perinatal transmission from
infected mothers, and high-risk practices in adolescents and young adults.
Prevalence remains underestimated because children at high risk are often not
screened. Treatment has evolved over the past decade with the advent of new
drugs, and global elimination is now possible. Direct-acting antiviral
combinations are safe and effective, with sustained viral suppression rate >90%, 
and Food and Drug Administration-approved for children ≥3 years old. Although
challenging, efficient screening and treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus early
is cost-effective and reduces burden of disease and its complications.
