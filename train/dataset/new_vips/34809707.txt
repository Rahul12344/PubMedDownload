BACKGROUND: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) transplantation had shown to
provide a potential source of cells in neurodegenerative disease studies and lead
to behavioral recovery in lentivirus transfected or, toxin-induced Huntington's
disease (HD) rodent model. Here, we aimed to observe if transplantation of
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION)-labeled hESCs could migrate in 
the neural degenerated area and improve motor dysfunction in an AAV2-Htt171-82Q
transfected Huntington rat model.
METHODS: All animals were randomly allocated into three groups at first: HD
group, sham group, and control group. After six weeks, the animals of the HD
group and sham group were again divided into two subgroups depending on animals
receiving either ipsilateral or contralateral hESCs transplantation. We performed
cylinder test and stepping test every two weeks after AAV2-Htt171-82Q injection
and hESCs transplantation. Stem cell tracking was performed once per two weeks
using T2 and T2*-weighted images at 4.7 Tesla MRI. We also performed
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to detect the presence of
hESCs markers, huntingtin protein aggregations, and iron in the striatum.
RESULTS: After hESCs transplantation, the Htt virus-injected rats exhibited
significant behavioral improvement in behavioral tests. SPION labeled hESCs
showed migration with hypointense signal in MRI. The cells were positive with
βIII-tubulin, GABA, and DARPP32.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results suggested that hESCs transplantation can be
a potential treatment for motor dysfunction of Huntington's disease.
