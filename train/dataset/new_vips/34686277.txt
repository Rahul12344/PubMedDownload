Following isolation of pseudorabies virus (PRV) from two hunting dogs in Oita
prefecture, Japan, we investigated the PRV antigen distribution in the tissues of
the infected animals. At necropsy, PRV-associated lesions included facial oedema,
tonsillar and meningeal congestion, blotchy haemorrhages on the pericardium and
mitral valves, and incomplete splenic contraction in one dog, with less prominent
findings in the other dog. Multiple pulmonary nodules were seen in both cases,
caused by the diploid form of Paragonimus westermani lung flukes, as confirmed by
PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and gene sequencing analyses.
Histological examination revealed that the PRV infection was associated with
lesions of non-suppurative encephalitis in the brainstem. PRV antigen was
detected in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, submucosal and myenteric
plexuses, and mononuclear cells, mainly in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, tonsils 
and spleen tissues. There was evidence of PRV dissemination to the brain via the 
trigeminal or olfactory routes, in addition to possible spread to lymphoid organs
via infected mononuclear cells.
