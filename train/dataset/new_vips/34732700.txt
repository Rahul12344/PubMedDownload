Peptide secondary metabolites are common in nature and have
diverse pharmacologically-relevant functions, from antibiotics to cross-kingdom
signaling. Here, we present a method to design large libraries of modified
peptides in Escherichia coli and screen them in vivo to identify those that bind 
to a single target-of-interest. Constrained peptide scaffolds were produced using
modified enzymes gleaned from microbial RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and
post-translationally modified peptide) pathways and diversified to build large
libraries. The binding of a RiPP to a protein target leads to the
intein-catalyzed release of an RNA polymerase σ factor, which drives the
expression of selectable markers. As a proof-of-concept, a selection was
performed for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain. A 1625 Da 
constrained peptide (AMK-1057) was found that binds with similar affinity
(990 ± 5 nM) as an ACE2-derived peptide. This demonstrates a generalizable method
to identify constrained peptides that adhere to a single protein target, as a
step towards "molecular glues" for therapeutics and diagnostics.
