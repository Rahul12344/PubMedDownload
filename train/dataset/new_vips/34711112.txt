Intestinal microbiota, dominated by bacteria, plays an important role in the
occurrence and the development of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which
is one of the most common liver diseases around the world. With sufficient
studies focusing on the gut bacterial community, chronic alcohol consumption is
now known as a key factor that alters the composition of gut bacterial community,
increases intestinal permeability, causes intestinal dysfunction, induces
bacterial translocation, and exacerbates the process of ALD via gut-liver axis.
However, gut non-bacterial communities including fungi, viruses, and archaea,
which may also participate in the disease, has received little attention relative
to the gut bacterial community. This paper will systematically collect the latest
literatures reporting non-bacterial communities in mammalian health and disease, 
and review their mechanisms in promoting the development of ALD including CLEC7A 
pathway, Candidalysin (a peptide toxin secreted by Candida albicans),
metabolites, and other chemical substances secreted or regulated by gut commensal
mycobiome, virome, and archaeome, hoping to bring novel insights on our current
knowledge of ALD.
