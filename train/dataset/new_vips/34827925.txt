Viral diseases challenge the health and welfare of pigs and undermine the
sustainability of swine farms. Their efficient control requires early and
reliable diagnosis, highlighting the importance of Point of Care (POC)
diagnostics in veterinary practice. The objective of this study was to validate a
novel POC system that utilizes Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) and
microfluidics to detect swine viral pathogens using oral fluids and Porcine
Parvovirus (PPV) and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2) as proofs of concept. The
sensitivity and specificity of the device were calculated for both viruses, and
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn. PPV had an Area Under 
Curve (AUC) value of 0.820 (95% CI: 0.760 to 0.880, p < 0.0001), and its optimal 
efficiency threshold of detection shifts was equal to 4.5 pm (68.6% sensitivity, 
77.1% specificity and Limit of Detection (LOD) value 106 viral copies/mL). PCV-2 
had an AUC value of 0.742 (95% CI: 0.670 to 0.815, p < 0.0001) and an optimal
efficiency threshold of shifts equal to 6.5 pm (69.5% sensitivity, 70.3%
specificity and LOD 3.3 × 105 copies/mL). In this work, it was proven that PICs
can be exploited for the detection of swine viral diseases. The novel device can 
be directly deployed on farms as a POC diagnostics tool.
