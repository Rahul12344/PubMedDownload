AIMS: Neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury is one of the most difficult
clinical problems after the loss of mobility, and pharmacological or
neuromodulation therapy showed limited efficacy. In this study, we examine the
possibility of pain modulation by a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)
encoding small-hairpin RNA against GCH1 (rAAV-shGCH1) in a spinal cord injury
model in which neuropathic pain was induced by a spinothalamic tract (STT)
lesion.
METHODS: Micro-electric lesioning was used to damage the left STT in rats
(n = 32), and either rAAV-shGCH1 (n = 19) or rAAV control (n = 6) was injected
into the dorsal horn of the rats at the same time. On postoperative days 3, 7,
and 14, we evaluated neuropathic pain using a behavioral test and microglial
activation by immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: A pain modulation effect of shGCH1 was observed from postoperative days 
3 to 14. The mechanical withdrawal threshold was 13.0 ± 0.95 in the shGCH1 group,
4.3 ± 1.37 in the control group, and 3.49 ± 0.85 in sham on postoperative day 3
(p < 0.0001) and continued to postoperative day 14 (shGCH1 vs. control:
11.4 ± 1.1 vs. 2.05 ± 0.60, p < 0.001 and shGCH1 vs. sham: 11.4 ± 1.1 vs.
1.43 ± 0.54, p < 0.001). Immunohistochemical staining of the spinal cord dorsal
horn showed deactivation of microglia in the shGCH1 group without any change of
delayed pattern of astrocyte activation as in STT model.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury can be modulated
bilaterally by deactivating microglial activation after a unilateral injection of
rAAV-shGCH1 into the dorsal horn of a STT lesion spinal cord pain model. This new
attempt would be another therapeutic approach for NP after SCI, which once
happens; there is no clear curative options still now.
