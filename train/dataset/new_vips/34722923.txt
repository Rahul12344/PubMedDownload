Introduction: In early 2020, at first surge of the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, many health care workers (HCW) were re-deployed to critical 
care environments to support intensive care teams looking after patients with
severe COVID-19. There was considerable anxiety of increased risk of COVID-19 for
these staff. To determine whether critical care HCW were at increased risk of
hospital acquired infection, we explored the relationship between workplace,
patient facing role and evidence of immune exposure to the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within a quaternary hospital
providing a regional critical care response. Routine viral surveillance was not
available at this time.
Methods: We screened over 500 HCW (25% of the total workforce) for history of
clinical symptoms of possible COVID19, assigning a symptom severity score, and
quantified SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies as evidence of immune exposure to the
virus.
Results: Whilst 45% of the cohort reported symptoms that they consider may have
represented COVID-19, 14% had evidence of immune exposure. Staffs in patient
facing critical care roles were least likely to be seropositive (9%) and staff
working in non-patient facing roles most likely to be seropositive (22%). Anosmia
and fever were the most discriminating symptoms for seropositive status. Older
males presented with more severe symptoms. Of the 12 staff screened positive by
nasal swab (10 symptomatic), 3 showed no evidence of seroconversion in
convalescence.
Conclusions: Patient facing staff working in critical care do not appear to be at
increased risk of hospital acquired infection however the risk of nosocomial
infection from non-patient facing staff may be more significant than previous
recognised. Most symptoms ascribed to possible COVID-19 were found to have no
evidence of immune exposure however seroprevalence may underrepresent infection
frequency. Older male staff were at the greatest risk of more severe symptoms.
