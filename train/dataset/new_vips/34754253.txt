Background: Data on the role of aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (AHP) systems in
the control of the COVID-19 pandemic are still emerging. This study provides
evidence of the environmental shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the hospital environment, and the efficacy of AHP
to eliminate it.
Methods: A total of 324 environmental sites (224 surfaces and 100 air samples)
belonging to 54 patient rooms were contextually collected and tested for genes of
SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR assays and Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2.
Results: The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was detected in seven sites (2.5%) of three 
patients' rooms, including six highly touched surfaces and one air sample. Viral 
shedding was directly related to the distance from the patient, with 1, 1.9, and 
3.5% of samples testing positive at 3, 2, and 1 meter, respectively
(P-value=0.02). None of the sites showed the viral genome following application
of 6% AHP. Of note, the viral genome was detected at 2 meters of a mildly
symptomatic case on a face mask in the absence of aerosol generating procedures.
Conclusion: Our data support the possible role of the hospital environment as a
source of infection, and the efficacy of AHP to eliminate the virus. Further
studies are needed to address the viability of the pathogen in these nosocomial
sites and the cost-effectiveness of routine hospital disinfection procedures
using AHP for SARS-CoV-2.
