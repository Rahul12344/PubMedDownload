Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) undergoing interferon (IFN)-α-based
therapies often exhibit a poor HBeAg serological response. Thus, there is an
unmet need for new therapies aimed at CHB. This study comprised two clinical
trials, including 130 CHB patients, who were treatment-naïve; in the first, 92
patients were systematically analyzed ex vivo for interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) 
expression and inhibitory molecules expression after receiving Peg-IFN-α-2b
therapy. In our second clinical trial, 38 non-responder patients, in whom IFN-α
therapy had failed, were treated with or without low-dose IL-2 for 24 weeks. We
then examined the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8+ T-cell response and the
clinical outcome, in these patients. Although the majority of the participants
undergoing Peg-IFN-α-2b therapy were non-responders, we observed a decrease in
CD25 expression on their CD4+ T cells, suggesting that IFN-α therapy may provide 
a rationale for sequential IL-2 treatment without increasing regulatory T cells
(Tregs). Following sequential therapy with IL-2, we demonstrated that the
non-responders experienced a decrease in the numbers of Tregs and programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1) expression. In addition, sequential IL-2 administration
rescued effective immune function, involving signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1) activation. Importantly, IL-2 therapy significantly
increased the frequency and function of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells, which
translated into improved clinical outcomes, including HBeAg seroconversion, among
the non-responder CHB patients. Our findings suggest that sequential IL-2 therapy
shows efficacy in rescuing immune function in non-responder patients with
refractory CHB.
