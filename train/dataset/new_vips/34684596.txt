BACKGROUND: Much research shows that blood calcidiol (25(OH)D3) levels correlate 
strongly with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. There is open discussion regarding
whether low D3 is caused by the infection or if deficiency negatively affects
immune defense. The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this
topic.
METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed to identify retrospective
cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood
levels. Mortality rates from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex, and
diabetes. Data were analyzed using correlation and linear regression.
RESULTS: One population study and seven clinical studies were identified, which
reported D3 blood levels preinfection or on the day of hospital admission. The
two independent datasets showed a negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and
mortality risk (r(17) = -0.4154, p = 0.0770/r(13) = -0.4886, p = 0.0646). For the
combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/mL (17.4-26.8), and a
significant Pearson correlation was observed (r(32) = -0.3989, p = 0.0194).
Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50
ng/mL D3.
CONCLUSIONS: The datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor
rather than just a side effect of the infection. Despite ongoing vaccinations, we
recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/mL to prevent or mitigate
new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.
