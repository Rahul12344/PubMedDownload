Calf diarrhoea has been a major cause of economic losses in the global dairy
industry. Many factors, including multiple pathogen infections, can directly or
indirectly cause calf diarrhoea. This study compared the faecal virome between 15
healthy calves and 15 calves with diarrhoea. Significantly lower diversity of
viruses was found in samples from animals with diarrhoea than those in the
healthy ones, and this feature may also be related to the age of the calves.
Viruses belonging to the families Astroviridae and Caliciviridae that may cause
diarrhoea in dairy calves have been characterized, which revealed that reads of
caliciviruses and astroviruses in diarrhoea calves were much higher than those in
healthy calves. Five complete genomic sequences closely related to Smacoviridae
have been identified, which may participate in the regulation of the gut virus
community ecology of healthy hosts together with bacteriophages. This research
provides a theoretical basis for further understanding of known or potential
enteric pathogens related to calf diarrhoea.
