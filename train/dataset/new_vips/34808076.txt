Despite its critical role in containing outbreaks, the efficacy of contact
tracing, measured as the sensitivity of case detection, remains an elusive
metric. We estimated the sensitivity of contact tracing by applying unilist
capture-recapture methods on data from the 2018-2020 outbreak of Ebola virus
disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To compute sensitivity, we
applied different distributional assumptions to the zero-truncated count data to 
estimate the number of unobserved case-patients with any contacts and infected
contacts. Geometric distributions were the best-fitting models. Our results
indicate that contact tracing efforts identified almost all (n = 792, 99%) of
case-patients with any contacts but only half (n = 207, 48%) of case-patients
with infected contacts, suggesting that contact tracing efforts performed well at
identifying contacts during the listing stage but performed poorly during the
contact follow-up stage. We discuss extensions to our work and potential
applications for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
