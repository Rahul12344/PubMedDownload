Effective, low-cost therapeutics are needed to prevent and treat COVID-19. Severe
COVID-19 disease is linked to excessive inflammation. Disulfiram is an approved
oral drug used to treat alcohol use disorder that is a potent anti-inflammatory
agent and an inhibitor of the viral proteases. We investigated the potential
effects of disulfiram on SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity in an
observational study using a large database of clinical records from the national 
US Veterans Affairs healthcare system. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted
for demographic information and diagnosis of alcohol use disorder revealed a
reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with disulfiram use at a hazard ratio of
0.66 (34% lower risk, 95% confidence interval 24-43%). There were no COVID-19
related deaths among the 188 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients treated with
disulfiram, in contrast to 5-6 statistically expected deaths based on the
untreated population (P = 0.03). Our epidemiological results suggest that
disulfiram may contribute to the reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19.
These results support carefully planned clinical trials to assess the potential
therapeutic effects of disulfiram in COVID-19.
