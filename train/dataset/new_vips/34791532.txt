Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection inflicts significant economic and
social burdens on many countries worldwide. Given the substantial morbidity and
mortality from HIV infection, there is an urgent need for accurate and early
detection of the virus. In this study, immunofluorescence and visual techniques
are described that detect the HIV-1 p24 antigen, which relied on selective
recognition of Ag+/Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and Cu2+/Cu+ using cadmium telluride
quantum dots (CdTe QDs). After the sandwich immunoreactions were accomplished,
the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) hydrolyzed L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) to
form ascorbic acid (AA) that further reduces Ag+ and Cu2+ to Ag NPs and Cu+,
respectively. This method was highly sensitive and selective and could detect as 
low as 1 pg/mL of p24 antigen by naked eyes and had a good linearity in the
concentration range 1-100 pg/mL. When using Ag+ and Cu2+ as media, the limit of
detection (LOD) of the new method was 0.3 pg/mL and 0.2 pg/mL, respectively.
Compared with clinical electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) results and
clinical data, this method demonstrated good consistency for the quantification
of HIV-1 p24 antigen in 34 clinical serum samples. In addition, this method could
accurately distinguish HIV from other viruses and infections such as hepatitis B 
virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, lipemia, and hemolysis. Therefore, our dual-mode analysis method
may provide additional solutions to identify clinical HIV infection. An
immunofluorescence and visualization dual-mode strategy for the detection of p24 
antigen was constructed based on immune recognition reaction and a phenomenon
that cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs) can selectively recognize Ag+/Ag
nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and Cu2+/Cu+.
