INTRODUCTION: : Hemophilia comprises a group of X-linked hemorrhagic disorders
that result from a deficiency of coagulation factors. The disorder affects mainly
males and leads to chronic pain, joint deformity, reduced mobility, and increased
mortality. Current therapies require frequent administration of replacement
clotting factors, but the emergence of alloantibodies (inhibitors) diminishes
their efficacy. New therapies are being developed to produce the deficient
clotting factors and prevent the emergence of inhibitors.
AREAS COVERED: : This article provides an update on the characteristics and
disease pathophysiology of hemophilia A, as well as current treatments, with a
special focus on ongoing clinical trials related to gene replacement therapies.
EXPERT OPINION: : Gene replacement therapies provide safe, durable, and stable
transgene expression while avoiding the challenges of clotting factor replacement
therapies in patients with hemophilia. Improving the specificity of the viral
construct and decreasing the therapeutic dose are critical toward minimizing
cellular stress, induction of the unfolded protein response, and the resulting
loss of protein production in liver cells. Next-generation gene therapies
incorporating chimeric DNA sequences in the transgene can increase clotting
factor synthesis and secretion, and advance the efficacy, safety, and durability 
of gene replacement therapy for hemophilia A as well as other blood clotting
disorders.
