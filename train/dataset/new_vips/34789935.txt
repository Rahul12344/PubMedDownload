Background: India's suicide rates are among the highest in the world and may
increase further as a consequence of COVID-19. There is a need to examine which
pandemic related stressors may be contributing to suicide, in order to inform the
deployment of suicide prevention strategies, for the current as well as future
pandemics.
Aim: To understand pandemic related stressors contributing to suicide in India.
Methods: We identified and conducted a thematic analysis of Internet media
reports of COVID-19 related suicides in India between February 1, 2020 (2 days
after the first COVID-19 case), and May 31, 2020, (the end of phase four of the
nationwide lockdown).
Results: Ten pandemic stressors spanning both disease and lockdown-related
factors were identified in 291 suicides. Economic hardship was present in a
third; other notable stressors were: fear of the virus; isolation; desperation to
be connected with loved ones or return home; and craving for alcohol. Men and
young people seemed particularly vulnerable to these stressors.
Conclusions: COVID-19 related suicides appear to be precipitated by social and
economic adversities, mainly associated with containment strategies. These
findings need to be confirmed by national suicide data. Suicide prevention
strategies should mitigate the impact of recognized stressors in the long term,
target high-risk individuals, and offer mental health care alongside containment 
strategies.
