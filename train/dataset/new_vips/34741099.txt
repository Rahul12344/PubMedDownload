Rapid design, screening, and characterization of biorecognition elements (BREs)
is essential for the development of diagnostic tests and antiviral therapeutics
needed to combat the spread of viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To address this need, we developed a high-throughput 
pipeline combining in silico design of a peptide library specific for SARS-CoV-2 
spike (S) protein and microarray screening to identify binding sequences. Our
optimized microarray platform allowed the simultaneous screening of ~ 2.5 k
peptides and rapid identification of binding sequences resulting in selection of 
four peptides with nanomolar affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we
demonstrated the successful integration of one of the top peptides into an
electrochemical sensor with a clinically relevant limit of detection for S
protein in spiked saliva. Our results demonstrate the utility of this novel
pipeline for the selection of peptide BREs in response to the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic, and the broader application of such a platform in response to future
viral threats.
