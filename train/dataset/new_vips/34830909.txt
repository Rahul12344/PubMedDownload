Fascin is an actin-binding protein that is encoded by the FSCN1 gene (located on 
chromosome 7). It triggers membrane projections and stimulates cell motility in
cancer cells. Fascin overexpression has been described in different types of
human cancers in which its expression correlated with tumor growth, migration,
invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, overexpression of fascin was found in
oncovirus-infected cells, such as human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV), disrupting the cell-cell adhesion and enhancing cancer progression. 
Based on these findings, several studies reported fascin as a potential biomarker
and a therapeutic target in various cancers. This review provides a brief
overview of the FSCN1 role in various cancers with emphasis on gynecological
malignancies. We also discuss fascin interactions with other genes and
oncoviruses through which it might induce cancer development and progression.
