Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted
infections in men and women. Most HPV studies have focused on vaccination toward 
women to prevent consequences of developing cervical cancer. However, persistent 
infections can cause penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers in men. Therefore,
recent public health recommendations toward vaccination in men have been raised. 
There is limited HPV prevalence data among men in many countries, including
Thailand. We conducted HPV sera IgG ELISA testing on a repository sera of Thai
men (average age 21 years old) entering the Royal Thai Army as recruits in 2013
(n = 1000). HPV IgG antibodies against virus-like particles of HPV- type 6, 11,
16e, and 18 were evaluated using a commercial ELISA kit. Overall, the anti-HPV
IgG was 47% (95% CI: 44%-50%). HPV seroprevalence was significantly associated
with residence regions with the highest prevalence in South (64%), but not
associated with educational level, marital status, or type of residence. This
data suggested that almost half of the Thai men in this cohort were exposed to
HPV by the age of 21. Thus, HPV vaccination provided to male adolescents should
be considered for disease prevention and minimizing transmission to sexual
partners.
