BACKGROUND: With the unprecedented spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,
primary healthcare workers (PHCWs) are having to shoulder the increasing weight
of this ongoing pandemic.
AIMS: This study explored the rate and covariates of depressive symptoms among
PHCWs in the Muscat governorate.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 10 May to 10 June
2020 among PHCWs working in all primary healthcares across the Muscat
governorate. Data on sociodemographic and risk factors of having at least one
underlying physical health condition, a psychiatric history, family history of
psychiatric disorders, and direct involvement with COVID-19 positive patients
were sought. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was then used to solicit
the presence of depressive symptoms. Those with a cutoff point ≥10 were
considered as showing depressive symptoms. Logistic regression was used to
determine risk factors associated with depressive symptoms in PHCWs after
adjusting for all sociodemographic factors.
FINDINGS: A total of 432 (72%) out of 600 PHCWs with an average age of 39.2 years
(SD = 7.8 years) ranging between 25.0 and 75.0 years responded to the survey.
There were more females (n = 281, 65.3%) than males, and more than 45% (n = 195) 
of them were physicians. Additionally, more than 78% (n = 338) had been in
contact with COVID-19 patients. There was a significant association between
different age groups and profession (P < .001), having at least one underlying
physical health condition (P = 0.001) and depressive symptom status (P = 0.038). 
A total of 78 out of the 423 subjects (18.1%) were considered to have depressive 
symptoms. After adjusting for all factors, the logistic regression model showed
that an age of 34 years or below (OR = 2.079, P = 0.021) and having at least one 
underlying physical health condition (OR = 2.216, P = 0.007) were factors
contributing significantly to depressive symptoms among the PHCWs.
