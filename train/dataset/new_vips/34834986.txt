The monitoring of herpesvirus infection provides useful information when
assessing marine mammals' health. This paper shows the prevalence of herpesvirus 
infection (80.85%) in 47 cetaceans stranded on the coast of the Valencian
Community, Spain. Of the 966 tissues evaluated, 121 tested positive when
employing nested-PCR (12.53%). The largest proportion of herpesvirus-positive
tissue samples was in the reproductive system, nervous system, and tegument.
Herpesvirus was more prevalent in females, juveniles, and calves. More than half 
the DNA PCR positive tissues contained herpesvirus RNA, indicating the presence
of actively replicating virus. This RNA was most frequently found in neonates.
Fourteen unique sequences were identified. Most amplified sequences belonged to
the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily, but a greater variation was found in
Alphaherpesvirinae sequences. This is the first report of systematic herpesvirus 
DNA and RNA determination in free-ranging cetaceans. Nine (19.14%) were infected 
with cetacean morbillivirus and all of them (100%) were coinfected with
herpesvirus. Lesions similar to those caused by herpesvirus in other species were
observed, mainly in the skin, upper digestive tract, genitalia, and central
nervous system. Other lesions were also attributable to concomitant etiologies or
were nonspecific. It is necessary to investigate the possible role of herpesvirus
infection in those cases.
