Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To halt the pandemic, multiple
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and several have been allowed for
emergency use and rollout worldwide. With novel SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging and 
circulating widely, whether the original vaccines that were designed based on the
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were effective against these variants has been a contentious
discussion. Moreover, some studies revealed the long-term changes of immune
responses post SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and the factors that might
impact the vaccine-induced immunity. Thus, in this review, we have summarized the
influence of mutational hotspots on the vaccine efficacy and characteristics of
variants of interest and concern. We have also discussed the reasons that might
result in discrepancies in the efficacy of different vaccines estimated in
different trials. Furthermore, we provided an overview of the duration of immune 
responses after natural infection or vaccination and shed light on the factors
that may affect the immunity induced by the vaccines, such as special disease
conditions, sex, and pre-existing immunity, with the aim of aiding in combating
COVID-19 and distributing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under the prevalence of diverse
SARS-CoV-2 variants.
