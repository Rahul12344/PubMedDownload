BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV),
and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are still
prevalent in many regions of China. Co-infections make it difficult to
distinguish their clinical symptoms and pathological changes. Therefore, a rapid 
and specific method is needed for the differential detection of these pathogens.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex qRT-PCR) 
for the simultaneous differential detection of ASFV, CSFV, and PRRSV.
METHODS: Three pairs of primers and TaqMan probes targeting the ASFV p72 gene,
CSFV 5' untranslated region, and PRRSV ORF7 gene were designed. After optimizing 
the reaction conditions, including the annealing temperature, primer
concentration, and probe concentration, multiplex qRT-PCR for simultaneous and
differential detection of ASFV, CSFV, and PRRSV was developed. Subsequently,
1,143 clinical samples were detected to verify the practicality of the assay.
RESULTS: The multiplex qRT-PCR assay could specifically and simultaneously detect
the ASFV, CSFV, and PRRSV with a detection limit of 1.78 × 100 copies for the
ASFV, CSFV, and PRRSV, but could not amplify the other major porcine viruses,
such as pseudorabies virus, porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1), PCV2, PCV3,
foot-and-mouth disease virus, porcine parvovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus,
and Senecavirus A. The assay had good repeatability with coefficients of
variation of intra- and inter-assay of less than 1.2%. Finally, the assay was
used to detect 1,143 clinical samples to evaluate its practicality in the field. 
The positive rates of ASFV, CSFV, and PRRSV were 25.63%, 9.36%, and 17.50%,
respectively. The co-infection rates of ASFV+CSFV, ASFV+PRRSV, CSFV+PRRSV, and
ASFV+CSFV+PRRSV were 2.45%, 2.36%, 1.57%, and 0.17%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex qRT-PCR developed in this study could provide a rapid,
sensitive, specific diagnostic tool for the simultaneous and differential
detection of ASFV, CSFV, and PRRSV.
