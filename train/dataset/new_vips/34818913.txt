Pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata), a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, is widely
cultivated throughout the world including India. During August 2020 to January
2021, stunted pumpkin plants (cv. Pusa Vishwas), showing chlorotic patches,
mosaic, and vein banding on leaves (e-Xtra Fig.1), were observed in the
experimental fields of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New
Delhi, India. Leaf-dip electron microscopy (EM) of the symptomatic plants (12 out
of 37 samples) revealed the association of long flexuous virus particles
measuring 650-950nm√ó10-12nm, suggestive of the presence of either crinivirus or
potyvirus or both. Subsequently, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on RNA extracted from the samples that had long
flexuous virus particles using generic primers for criniviruses i.e. CriniPol-F: 
GCY CCS AGR GTK AAT GA and CriniPol-R: ACC TTG RGA YTT RTC AAA targeting partial 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding region (Martin et al. 2003) and specific
primers for papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) targeting a part of 3' NIb and full coat
protein (CP) gene (Basavaraj et al., 2019) separately. All tested samples were
positive for both crinivirus and PRSV as expected size amplicons were obtained,
accounting for about 32% prevalence. As PRSV is a well-studied virus infecting
cucurbits, further work was not carried on this virus and only the RT-PCR
amplicon indicative of crinivirus (~515 bp) was cloned into the pGEM-T easy
cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced for further confirmation of
the virus presence. The obtained sequence (GenBank accession No MZ318672) shared 
up to 90% nucleotide and 100% amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding
genomic region of a cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) isolate from Greece
(LT841297). To confirm the identity of the crinivirus species present in the same
pumpkin sample, the CP gene (753bp) was amplified and sequenced using CCYV CP
gene-specific primers CP-F (5'-ATG GAG AAG ACY GAC AAT AAA CAA AAT GAT GA-3') and
CP-R (5'-TTA TTT ACT ACA ACC TCC CGG TGC CAA C-3') (modified from Kheireddine et 
al. 2020). Sequence analysis using the BioEdit tool (version 2.0) revealed that
the crinivirus present in pumpkin (KC577202) shared 95 to 100% nucleotide (and 98
to 100% amino acid) sequence identity with the corresponding gene sequences of
CCYV isolates originating from cucurbitaceous hosts from diverse locations. The
presence of CCYV was further validated by a whitefly transmission-based bioassay 
followed by RT-PCR confirmation. The bioassay was performed by the whitefly
species Bemisia tabaci (biotype Asia II7) using the acquisition access period and
inoculation access period of 24 hours each. Six whitefly individuals per plant
were used for inoculating ten pumpkin plants (cv. Pusa Vishwas) at the first true
leaf stage grown in pots containing soilrite as the medium in insect-proof cages.
All ten plants inoculated using whiteflies exhibited chlorosis and stunting
symptoms 12-15 days post-inoculation (e-Xtra Fig.2) and were found positive for
CCYV in RT-PCR assay performed using CCYV CP gene-specific primers. Though CCYV
had been reported worldwide (Tzanetakis et al. 2013), its occurrence had not been
reported from India. Results of the present study confirm the infection of
pumpkin plants by CCYV and constitute the first report of its presence in India. 
Further, there is a need to investigate the extent of its spread and impact of
this virus on the production of cucurbitaceous crops in the country.
