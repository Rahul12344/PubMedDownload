The COVID-19 pandemic has posed novel risks related to the indoor mixing of
individuals from different households and challenged policymakers to adequately
regulate this behaviour. While in many cases household visits are necessary for
the purpose of social care, they have been linked to broadening community
transmission of the virus. In this study we propose a novel, privacy-preserving
framework for the measurement of household visitation at national and regional
scales, making use of passively collected mobility data. We implement this
approach in England from January 2020 to May 2021. The measures expose
significant spatial and temporal variation in household visitation patterns,
impacted by both national and regional lockdown policies, and the rollout of the 
vaccination programme. The findings point to complex social processes unfolding
differently over space and time, likely informed by variations in policy
adherence, vaccine relaxation, and regional interventions.
