This mixed-methods study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 1493
Grades 7, 8, and 9 students' self-perceived emotional states in Wuhan, China when
it was locked down for the pandemic on January 23, 2020 and when the lockdown was
lifted on April 8, 2020, as well as the changes of their emotional states over
the 1-year period after the lockdown was lifted. A five-point Likert scale survey
was administered to the participants between March 1 and April 1, 2020 when Wuhan
was blocked down; and three focus group interviews were conducted between May 1
and May 31, 2021, 1 year after the lockdown was lifted. The results showed that
these students in Wuhan experienced feelings of loss of control and negative
emotions when the city was locked down and they were home quarantined;
furthermore, there were significant differences for their self-perceived feelings
of loss of control and negative emotions across demographic variables of gender, 
grade level, physical activity, social economic status, and family cohesion;
finally, their emotional states changed substantially at different time nodes
during this pandemic. Implications for students, parents, and schools are
discussed.
