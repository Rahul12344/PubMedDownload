Importance: A slow or incomplete civil registry makes it impossible to determine 
excess mortality due to COVID-19 and difficult to inform policy.
Objective: To quantify the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with excess
mortality and household income in rural Bangladesh in 2020.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated survey study is based on an
in-person census followed by 2 rounds of telephone calls. Data were collected
from a sample of 135 villages within a densely populated 350-km2 rural area of
Bangladesh. Household data were obtained first in person and subsequently over
the telephone. For the analysis, mortality data were stratified by month, age,
sex, and household education. Mortality rates were modeled by bayesian multilevel
regression, and the strata were aggregated to the population by
poststratification. Data analysis was performed from February to April 2021.
Exposures: Date and cause of any changes in household composition, as well as
changes in income and food availability.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality rates were compared for 2019 and 2020, both
without adjustment and after adjustment for nonresponse and differences in
demographic variables between surveys. Income and food availability reported for 
January, May, and November 2020 were also compared.
Results: Enumerators collected data from an initial 16 054 households in January 
2020; 14 551 households (91%) responded when contacted again by telephone in May 
2020, and 11 933 households (74%)responded when reached again over the telephone 
in November 2020, for a total of 58 806 individuals (29 726 female participants
[50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 26.4 [19.8] years). A total of 276 deaths were reported
between February and the end of October 2020 for the subset of the population
that could be contacted twice over the telephone, slightly below the 289 deaths
reported for the same population over the same period in 2019. After adjustment
for survey nonresponse and poststratification, 2020 mortality changed by -8% (95%
CI, -21% to 7%) compared with an annualized mortality of 6.1 deaths per 1000
individuals in 2019. However, in May 2020, salaried primary income earners
reported a 40% decrease in monthly income (from 17 485 to 10 835 Bangladeshi
Taka), and self-employed earners reported a 60% decrease in monthly income
(23 083 to 8521 Bangladeshi Taka), with only a small recovery observed by
November 2020.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of households in rural Bangladesh,
all-cause mortality was lower in 2020 compared with 2019. Restrictions imposed by
the government may have limited the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic in rural
areas, although economic data suggest that these restrictions need to be
accompanied by expanded welfare programs.
