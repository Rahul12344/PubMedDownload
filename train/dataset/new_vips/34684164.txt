Background and Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems worldwide 
made major changes to their organization, delaying diagnosis and treatment across
a broad spectrum of pathologies. Concerning surgery, there was an evident
reduction in all elective and emergency activities, particularly for benign
pathologies such as acute diverticulitis, for which we have identified a
reduction in emergency room presentation with mild forms and an increase with
more severe forms. The aim of our review was to discover new data on emergency
presentation for patients with acute diverticulitis during the Covid-19 pandemic 
and their current management, and to define a better methodology for surgical
decision-making. Method: We conducted a scoping review on 25 trials, analyzing
five points: reduced hospital access for patients with diverticulitis, the
preferred treatment for non-complicated diverticulitis, the role of CT scanning
in primary evaluation and percutaneous drainage as a treatment, and changes in
surgical decision-making and preferred treatment strategies for complicated
diverticulitis. Results: We found a decrease in emergency access for patients
with diverticular disease, with an increased incidence of complicated
diverticulitis. The preferred treatment was conservative for non-complicated
forms and in patients with COVID-related pneumonia, percutaneous drainage for
abscess, or with surgery delayed or reserved for diffuse peritonitis or sepsis.
Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic we observed an increased number of
complicated forms of diverticulitis, while the total number decreased, possibly
due to delay in hospital or ambulatory presentation because of the fear of
contracting COVID-19. We observed a greater tendency to treat these more severe
forms by conservative means or drainage. When surgery was necessary, there was a 
preference for an open approach or a delayed operation.
