Low-income households (LIHs) have experienced increased poverty and inaccess to
healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting their ability to
adhere to health-protective behaviors. We use an epidemiological model to show
how a households' inability to adopt social distancing, owing to constraints in
utility and healthcare expenditure, can drastically impact the course of disease 
outbreaks in five urban U.S. counties. LIHs suffer greater burdens of disease and
death than higher income households, while functioning as a consistent source of 
virus exposure for the entire community due to socioeconomic barriers to
following public health guidelines. These impacts worsened when social distancing
policy could not be imposed. Health interventions combining social distancing and
LIH resource protection strategies (e.g., utility and healthcare access) were the
most effective in limiting virus spread for all income levels. Policies need to
address the multidimensionality of energy, housing, and healthcare access for
future disaster management.
