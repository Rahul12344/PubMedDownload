BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2
variants have sequentially emerged. In France, most cases were due to spike
D641G-harbouring viruses that descended initially from the Wuhan strain, then by 
the variant of B.1.160 lineage we called Marseille-4 since the summer of 2020,
which was followed by the Alpha and Beta variants in early 2021, then the Delta
variant currently.
METHODS: We determined the neutralising antibody (nAb) titres in sera from
convalescent individuals previously infected by these four major local variants
and from vaccine recipients to the original Wuhan strain and nine variants,
including two recent circulating Delta isolates.
RESULTS: The results show high inter-individual heterogeneity in nAbs, especially
according to the variant tested. The major variations among nAbs are based on the
genotype responsible for the infection. Patients previously infected with the
beta and B.1.160 variants had the lowest nAb titres. We show that this
heterogeneity is well explained by spike protein mutants modelling using in
silico approaches. The highest titres were observed in individuals vaccinated
with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, even against the delta variant.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunity acquired naturally after infection is highly dependent on
the infecting variant, and, unexpectedly, mRNA-based vaccine efficacy was shown
to be often better than natural immunity in eliciting neutralising antibodies.
