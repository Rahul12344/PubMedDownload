Facing new COVID-19 waves, the effectiveness of BBIBP-CorV has been noted to be
low in countries whose populations were already administered two doses of the
vaccine. Heterologous vaccination using ChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2 elicited higher
immunogenicity compared with homologous immunization. BBIBP-CorV/BNT162b2
combination is worth testing. In this pilot prospective cohort study conducted at
Makassed General Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon, from February 17, 2021, to June 30,
2021, we tested the safety and immunogenicity of a BNT162b2 booster dose in
COVID-19-naïve individuals who had received two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine. 
Heterologous booster vaccination was found to be safe and well tolerated. It was 
significantly associated with higher anti-spike IgG geometric mean titers
compared to that after homologous BNT162b2 immunization in COVID-19-naïve
individuals [(8040BAU/mL, 95%confidence interval (CI), 4612-14016) vs
(1384BAU/mL, 95%CI, 1063-1801), respectively, (P < 0.0001)]. In countries with
limited access to mRNA vaccines and where populations have already received
BBIBP-CorV, mixing BBIBP-CorV/BNT162b2 is seen to overcome the low immunogenicity
induced by BBIBP-CorV alone, thus potentially providing protection against
emerging variants.
