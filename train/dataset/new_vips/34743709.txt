BACKGROUND: With the advancement of sequencing technologies, a plethora of
noncoding RNA (ncRNA) species have been widely discovered, including microRNAs
(miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). However, the
mechanism of these non-coding RNAs in diseases caused by enterovirus d68 (EV-D68)
remains unclear. The goal of this research was to identify significantly altered 
circRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs pathways in RD cells infected with EV-D68,
analyze their target relationships, demonstrate the competing endogenous RNA
(ceRNA) regulatory network, and evaluate their biological functions.
METHODS: The total RNAs were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing technology, 
and differentially expressed genes between control and infection groups were
screened using bioinformatics method. We discovered the targeting relationship
between three ncRNAs and mRNA using bioinformatics methods, and then built a
ceRNA regulatory network centered on miRNA. The biological functions of
differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were discovered through GO and KEGG
enrichment analysis. Create a protein interaction network (PPI) to seek for hub
mRNAs and learn more about protein-protein interactions. The relative expression 
was verified using RT-qPCR. The effects of Fos and ARRDC3 on virus replication
were confirmed using RT-qPCR, virus titer (TCID50/ml), Western blotting.
RESULTS: 375 lncRNAs (154 upregulated and 221 downregulated), 33 circRNAs (32
upregulated and 1 downregulated), 96 miRNAs (49 upregulated and 47
downregulated), and 239 mRNAs (135 upregulated and 104 downregulated) were
identified as differently in infected group compare to no-infected group. A
single lncRNA or circRNA can be connected with numerous miRNAs, which
subsequently coregulate additional mRNAs, according to the ceRNA regulatory
network. The majority of DEmRNAs were shown to be connected to DNA binding,
transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, transcription factor, MAPK
signaling pathways, Hippo signal pathway, and apoptosis pathway, according to GO 
and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The hub mRNAs with EGR1, Fos and Jun as the
core were screened through PPI interaction network. We preliminarily demonstrated
that the Fos and ARRDC3 genes can suppress EV-D68 viral replication in order to
further verify the results of full transcriptome sequencing.
CONCLUSION: The results of whole transcriptome analysis after EV-D68 infection of
RD cells were first reported in this study, and for the first time, a ceRNA
regulation network containing miRNA at its center was established for the first
time. The Fos and ARRDC3 genes were found to hinder viral in RD cells. This study
establishes a novel insight host response during EV-D68 infection and further
investigated potential drug targets.
