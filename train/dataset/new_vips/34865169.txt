OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and laboratory
findings in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) with those of other respiratory viruses in
critically ill children.
METHODS: It is a single center retrospective descriptive study conducted in a
32-bed pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Our study was performed in Ankara
City Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were collected, and we
recorded antibiotic use, antiviral treatments, respiratory and extracorporeal
supports, PICU stay, and survival rates.
RESULTS: A total of 202 pediatric patients who tested positive for either
COVID-19 or for another respiratory virus (RVP) were included in the study.
Seventy-two patients were COVID-19 positive. The median age of COVID-19 positive 
patients and RVP positive patients was 97 and 17 months, respectively. Hypoxia
was much more common in patients with RVP than in COVID-19 patients. Low oxygen
saturation in arterial blood (SaO2), increased oxygen saturation index (OSI), and
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) needs were more significant in RVP patients
than in COVID-19 patients. Respiratory support therapies, such as high-flow nasal
cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), were used more frequently in
RVP patients than in COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSION: It is important to distinguish between Covid-19 and RVP cases in
order to prioritize intensive care needs in these patients. In addition,
non-Covid diseases should not be left aside in the pandemic and appropriate care 
should be provided to them.
