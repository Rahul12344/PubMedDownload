The main edible and cultivated banana varieties are intra- and interspecific
hybrids of the two main Musa species, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, having 
diploid genomes denoted A and B, respectively. The B genome naturally hosts
sequences of banana streak virus (BSV) named endogenous BSV (eBSV). Upon stress, 
eBSVs are identified as the origin of BSV infection for at least three BSV
species, causing banana streak disease. For each of the three species, BSV and
eBSV share >99.9 % sequence identity, complicating PCR-based diagnosis of viral
infection in the B genome-containing bananas. Here, we designed a quantitative
PCR-based method to only quantify episomal BSV particles produced, overcoming the
limitation of eBSV also being detected by qPCR by using it as a 'calibrator'.
However, our results revealed unexpected variation of eBSV amplification in
calibrator plants composed of a clonal population of 53 replicating virus-free
banana hybrids with the same AAB genotype. Our in-depth molecular analyses
suggest that this calibrator variation is due to the variable abundance of
non-encapsidated extrachromosomal viral DNA, likely produced via the
transcription of eBSVs, followed by occasional reverse transcription. We also
present evidence that accumulation of viral transcripts in AAB plants is
downregulated both at post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels by an RNA
interference mechanism that keeps the plants free of virus infection. Finally, we
recommend that such eBSV amplification variation be taken into account to
establish a quantitative viral diagnostic for banana plants with the B genome.
