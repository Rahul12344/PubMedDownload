This study assesses attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and the predictive
value of COVID-VAC, a novel scale, among adults in the four largest US
metropolitan areas and nationally. A 36-item survey of 6037 Americans was
conducted in mid-April 2021. The study reports factors for COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance among: (1) already vaccinated; (2) unvaccinated but willing to accept 
a vaccine; and (3) unvaccinated and unwilling to vaccinate. More than 20% were
unwilling to vaccinate, expressing concerns about vaccine efficacy and safety and
questioning the disease's severity. Poverty, working outside of the home and
conservative political views are predictors of unwillingness. Conversely, those
who either personally tested positive for COVID-19, or had a family member who
did so, were more likely to accept vaccination. Majorities of all respondents
supported vaccination mandates for employees and university students. Respondents
preferred to receive vaccines in their doctor´s office. Lower income and
conservative ideology, but not race, were strongly associated with vaccine
unwillingness. The predictive value of COVID-VAC was demonstrated. While
vaccination mandates are likely to be accepted, additional effective, targeted
interventions to increase vaccine uptake are needed urgently.
