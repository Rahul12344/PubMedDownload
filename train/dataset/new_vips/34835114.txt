Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) modulates the host cell cycle. The
HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr arrests the cell cycle at the G2 phase in dividing
cells, and the ability of Vpr to induce G2 arrest is well conserved among primate
lentiviruses. Additionally, Vpr-mediated G2 arrest likely correlates with
enhanced HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages. Here, we screened
small-interfering RNA to reveal candidates that suppress Vpr-induced G2 arrest
and identified Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) required for efficient G2 
arrest. Interestingly, HIP1 was not essential for Vpr-induced DNA double-strand
breaks, which are required for activation of the DNA-damage checkpoint and G2
arrest. Furthermore, HIP1 knockdown suppressed HIV-1 infection in
monocyte-derived macrophages. This study identifies HIP1 as a factor promoting
Vpr-induced G2 arrest and HIV-1 infection in macrophages.
