Various Leptospira components have been identified as candidate antigens for the 
detection of antibody to Leptospira. LipL32 is a Leptospira membrane protein
which has been widely studied. The report of Leptospira whole-genome sequencing
demonstrated that pathogenic Leptospira contained the nucleotide sequence (colA
gene) coding for the collagenase. Expression of ColA protein and its enzymatic
activity was demonstrated. In this study, cloned ColA protein, in comparison with
LipL32, was used as an antigen for antibody detection. Thirty pairs of sera from 
human leptospirosis patients were tested. Sera from blood donors, and patients
with scrub typhus and dengue virus infection (20 samples from each group) were
tested for the specificity. All sera from leptospirosis patients tested in this
study reacted with both ColA and LipL32 proteins. Sera from blood donors,
patients with scrub typhus and dengue virus infection did not react with ColA
protein. Data suggested that sensitivity and specificity of ColA protein for
Leptospira antibody detection were 100%. In addition, ColA protein showed higher 
specificity than LipL32. Our data suggested that ColA protein could be another
candidate antigen for antibody detection in leptospirosis diagnosis.
