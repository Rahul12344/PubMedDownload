This national study investigated the positives reported by residents experiencing
the large-scale public health measures instituted in Australia to manage the
first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Most Australians had not previously 
experienced the traditional public health measures used (social distancing, hand 
hygiene and restriction of movement) and which could potentially impact
negatively on mental well-being. The research design included qualitative
semi-structured phone interviews where participants described their early
pandemic experiences. Data analysis used a rapid identification of themes
technique, well-suited to large-scale qualitative research. The ninety
participants (mean age 48 years; 70 women) were distributed nationally. Analysis 
revealed five themes linked with mental well-being and the concept of silver
linings: safety and security, gratitude and appreciation, social cohesion and
connections, and opportunities to reset priorities and resilience. Participants
demonstrated support for the public health measures and evidence of individual
and community resilience. They were cognisant of positives despite personal
curtailment and negative impacts of public health directives. Stories of hope,
strength, and acceptance, innovative connections with others and focusing on
priorities and opportunities within the hardship were important strategies that
others could use in managing adversity.
