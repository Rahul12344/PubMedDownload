Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. Recently, studies
demonstrate that antidepressants generating BDNF not only maintain synaptic
signal transmission but also repress neuroinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and
IL-1β. Therefore, promoting BDNF expression provides a strategy for the treatment
of depression. Our recent research has indicated that programmed cell death 4
(Pdcd4) is a new target for antidepressant treatment by facilitating BDNF.
Herein, we modified Pdcd4 specific small interfering RNA (siPdcd4) with the
rabies virus glycoprotein peptide (RVG/siPdcd4) which enables it cross the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). We found that RVG/siPdcd4 complex was selectively
delivered to neurons and microglia and silenced the expression of Pdcd4, thereby 
up-regulating the level of BDNF and down-regulating IL-6 and IL-1β expression.
More importantly, RVG/siPdcd4 injection attenuated synaptic plasticity impairment
and protected mice from CRS-induced depressive behavior. These findings suggest
that RVG/siPdcd4 complex is a potential therapeutic medicine for depression.
