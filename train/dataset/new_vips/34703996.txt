Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection often exacerbates bronchial asthma,
but there is no licensed RSV vaccine or specific treatments. Here we show that
RSV-induced alveolar macrophages, which produce high levels of matrix
metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12), exacerbate allergic airway inflammation with
increased neutrophil infiltration. When mice subjected to allergic airway
inflammation via exposure to the house dust mite antigen (HDM) were infected with
RSV (HDM/RSV), MMP-12 expression, viral load, neutrophil infiltration, and airway
hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were increased compared to those in the HDM and RSV
groups. These exacerbations in the HDM/RSV group were attenuated in
MMP-12-deficient mice and mice treated with MMP408, a selective MMP-12 inhibitor,
but not in mice treated with dexamethasone. Finally, M2-like macrophages produced
MMP-12, and its production was promoted by increase of IFN-β-induced IL-4
receptor expression with RSV infection. Thus, targeting MMP-12 represents a
potentially novel therapeutic strategy for the exacerbation of asthma.
