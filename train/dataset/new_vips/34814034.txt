We report the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients (mid-turbinate
swabs and exhaled breath aerosol samples) in concentrations as low as 60
copies/mL of the virus in seconds by electrical transduction of the SARS-CoV-2 S1
spike protein antigen via SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein antibodies immobilized on
bilayer quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene without gate or signal
amplification. The sensor demonstrates the spike protein antigen detection in a
concentration as low as 1 ag/mL. The heterostructure of the SARS-CoV-2
antibody/graphene-based sensor is developed through a simple and low-cost
fabrication technique. Furthermore, sensors integrated into a portable testing
unit distinguished B.1.1.7 variant positive samples from infected patients
(mid-turbinate swabs and saliva samples, 4000-8000 copies/mL) with a response
time of as fast as 0.6 s. The sensor is reusable, allowing for reimmobilization
of the crosslinker and antibodies on the biosensor after desorption of biomarkers
by NaCl solution or heat treatment above 40 °C.
