BACKGROUND: We assessed maternal and neonatal outcomes of critically ill pregnant
and puerperal patients in the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19).
METHODS: Records of pregnant and puerperal women with polymerase chain reaction
positive COVID-19 virus who were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) from
March 2020 to August 2021 were investigated. Demographic, clinical and laboratory
data, pharmacotherapy, and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. These outcomes were
compared between patients that were discharged from ICU and patients who died in 
ICU.
RESULTS: Nineteen women were included in this study. Additional oxygen was
required in all cases (100%). Eight patients (42%) were intubated and
mechanically ventilated. All patients that were mechanically ventilated have
died. Increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) was seen in all patients
(100%). D-dimer values increased in 15 patients (78.9%); interleukin-6 (IL-6)
increased in 16 cases (84.2%). Sixteen patients used antiviral drugs. Eleven
patients were discharged from the ICU and eight patients have died due to
complications of COVID-19 showing an ICU mortality rate of 42.1%. Mean number of 
hospitalized days in ICU was significantly lower in patients that were discharged
(P = 0.037). Seventeen patients underwent cesarean-section (C/S) (89.4%). Mean
birth week was significantly lower in patients who died in ICU (P = 0.024).
Eleven preterm (57.8%) and eight term deliveries (42.1%) occurred.
CONCLUSION: High mortality rate was detected among critically ill
pregnant/parturient patients followed in the ICU. Main predictors of mortality
were the need of invasive mechanical ventilation and higher number of days
hospitalized in ICU. Rate of C/S operations and preterm delivery were high.
Pleasingly, the rate of neonatal death was low and no neonatal COVID-19 occurred.
