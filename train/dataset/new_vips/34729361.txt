Context: While diabetes is a risk factor for severe illness from severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in adults, there is
conflicting data surrounding the relationship between the virus and diabetic
disease process in children.
Objective: This case series aims to illustrate an increase in the incidence of
types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM) between April - November 2020 at a
large tertiary care children's hospital and examine the characteristics and
adverse outcomes in these children. In addition, two children with significant
complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes are
highlighted.
Methods: Hospitalized children with T1DM or T2DM and SARS-CoV-2 infection were
identified, and electronic medical records were reviewed.
Results: We observed a 16.3% increased rate of new-onset T1DM and 205.3%
increased rate of new-onset insulin-dependent T2DM between April and November
2020 when compared to the same observational time frame in 2019. Among children
with new-onset T1DM, 56.9% presented with DKA in 2019 and 47.1% in 2018 compared 
to 64.3% in 2020, which was higher than the national average. Twenty-eight
children were diagnosed with COVID-19 and diabetes during this time. The 2
described cases with significant complications from COVID-19 and DKA required
large doses of intravenous insulin over a prolonged duration.
Conclusion: This study highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic might have led to an
increased rate of new-onset T1DM, T2DM, and DKA in children and adolescents
compared to a similar time frame in the prior 2 years. The clinical phenotypes
and outcomes in children with diabetes to COVID-19 infection may be distinct and 
therefore, future pediatric specific studies are needed to define the role of
SARS-CoV-2.
