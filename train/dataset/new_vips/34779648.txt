In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, in accordance with the principles of
'unified command, early involvement, prompt review and scientific approval' as
well as the requirements of ensuring product safety, effectiveness and
controllable quality, the Center for Medical Device Evaluation (CMDE) has issued 
Key Points of Technical Review for the Registration of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid
Tests (Key Points) to provide the requirements of tests. Because of the
sustainability of the pandemic, more efforts and attempts are needed for
SARS-CoV-2 detection and control. This article interprets the Key Points issued
by the CMDE and provides certain refinements to wider audiences.
