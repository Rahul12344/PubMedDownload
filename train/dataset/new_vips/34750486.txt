Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious viral respiratory
illness. This illness is spurred on by a coronavirus known as SARS-associated
coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first detected in Asia in late February 2003.
The genome of this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the study 
of SARS-CoV disease and the identification of effective drugs to treat this
disease can be new clues for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2. This study aimed to
discover novel potential drugs for SARS-CoV disease in order to treating
SARS-Cov-2 disease based on a novel systems biology approach. To this end, gene
co-expression network analysis was applied. First, the gene co-expression network
was reconstructed for 1441 genes, and then two gene modules were discovered as
significant modules. Next, a list of miRNAs and transcription factors that target
gene co-expression modules' genes were gathered from the valid databases, and two
sub-networks formed of transcription factors and miRNAs were established.
Afterward, the list of the drugs targeting obtained sub-networks' genes was
retrieved from the DGIDb database, and two drug-gene and drug-TF interaction
networks were reconstructed. Finally, after conducting different network
analyses, we proposed five drugs, including FLUOROURACIL, CISPLATIN, SIROLIMUS,
CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, and METHYLDOPA, as candidate drugs for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
treatment. Moreover, ten miRNAs including miR-193b, miR-192, miR-215, miR-34a,
miR-16, miR-16, miR-92a, miR-30a, miR-7, and miR-26b were found to be significant
miRNAs in treating SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
