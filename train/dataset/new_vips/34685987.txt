The Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) is a biosecurity initiative
operated by the Australian federal government's Department of Agriculture, Water 
and the Environment (DAWE). It is unique worldwide because it deals specifically 
with the potential arrival via unregulated pathways of exotic threats from
overseas in a vast and sparsely populated region. It aims to protect the nation's
animal- and plant-based production industries, as well as the environment, from
incursions of organisms from countries that lie immediately to the north. These
are diseases, pests, and weeds present in these countries that are currently
either absent from, or under active containment in, Australia and may arrive by
natural or human-assisted means. This review article focuses on the plant viruses
and virus-like diseases that are most highly targeted by the NAQS program. It
presents eight pathogen species/group entries in the NAQS A list of target
pathogens, providing an overview of the historical and current situation, and
collates some new data obtained from surveillance activities conducted in
northern Australia and collaborative work overseas.
