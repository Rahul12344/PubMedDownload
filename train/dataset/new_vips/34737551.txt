Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently ongoing worldwide and
causes a lot of deaths in many countries. Although different vaccines for the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been 
developed and are now available, there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat 
the disease, except for Remdesivir authorized by the US FDA to counteract the
emergency. Thus, it can be useful to find alternative therapies based on the
employment of natural compounds, with antiviral features, to circumvent
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-clinical studies highlighted the antiviral activities
of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin primarily found in green tea,
against various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize this 
experimental evidence and highlight the potential use of EGCG as an alternative
therapeutic choice for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
