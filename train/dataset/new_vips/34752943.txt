The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has particularly affected people with
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (OCS) has been suspected for those with contamination-related OCD
(C-OCD). However, the course of OCS over the ongoing pandemic remains unclear. We
assessed 268 participants with OCD (n = 184 with C-OCD) in an online survey at
the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, reassessing 179 participants (66.8%,
104 C-OCD) three months later. We assessed severity of OCD (OCI-R), depression
(PHQ-9), experiential avoidance, as well as functional and dysfunctional beliefs.
Overall, OCS and depressive symptoms did not substantially change over time.
However, when people with and without C-OCD were compared, symptoms improved in
patients without C-OCD (nC-OCD) but remained stable in patients with C-OCD over
time. Symptom improvement was associated with male gender, higher initial OCI-R, 
and nC-OCD. Experiential avoidance and beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic
did not generally predict change in OCS. People with OCD, particularly those with
nC-OCD, showed tentative signs for signs of adapting, whereas distress in those
with C-OCD remained at a high level, underlining the burden for these patients.
Clinicians should be informed about how to maintain effective treatment for C-OCD
during a pandemic.
