Iris biometric detection provides contactless authentication, preventing the
spread of COVID-19-like contagious diseases. However, these systems are prone to 
spoofing attacks attempted with the help of contact lenses, replayed video, and
print attacks, making them vulnerable and unsafe. This paper proposes the iris
liveness detection (ILD) method to mitigate spoofing attacks, taking global-level
features of Thepade's sorted block truncation coding (TSBTC) and local-level
features of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of the iris image.
Thepade's SBTC extracts global color texture content as features, and GLCM
extracts local fine-texture details. The fusion of global and local content
presentation may help distinguish between live and non-live iris samples. The
fusion of Thepade's SBTC with GLCM features is considered in experimental
validations of the proposed method. The features are used to train nine assorted 
machine learning classifiers, including na√Øve Bayes (NB), decision tree (J48),
support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP),
and ensembles (SVM + RF + NB, SVM + RF + RT, RF + SVM + MLP, J48 + RF + MLP) for 
ILD. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure are used to evaluate the
performance of the projected ILD variants. The experimentation was carried out on
four standard benchmark datasets, and our proposed model showed improved results 
with the feature fusion approach. The proposed fusion approach gave 99.68%
accuracy using the RF + J48 + MLP ensemble of classifiers, immediately followed
by the RF algorithm, which gave 95.57%. The better capability of iris liveness
detection will improve human-computer interaction and security in the
cyber-physical space by improving person validation.
