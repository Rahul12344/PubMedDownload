A lactic acid bacterial strain, Lactobacillus plantarum SN35N, which has been
isolated from the pear, secretes negatively charged acidic exopolysaccharide
(EPS) to outside cells. We have previously found that the SN35N-derived acidic
EPS inhibits the catalytic activity of hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35) promoting
inflammation. The aim of this study is to find other health benefits of EPS. EPS 
has been found to exhibit an inhibitory effect against the influenza virus
(Alphainfluenzavirus Influenza A virus) and feline calicivirus (Vesivirus Feline 
calicivirus), which is recognized as a model of norovirus. Although more studies 
on the structure-function relationship of EPSs are needed, SN35N-derived EPS is a
promising lead for developing not only anti-inflammatory agents, but also
antiviral substances.
