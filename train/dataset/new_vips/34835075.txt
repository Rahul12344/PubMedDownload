Partitiviruses are one of the most prevalent double-stranded RNA viruses that
have been identified mostly in filamentous fungi and plants. Partitiviruses
generally infect host fungi asymptomatically but infrequently exert significant
effect(s) on morphology and virulence, thus being considered a potential source
of biological control agents against pathogenic fungi. In this study, we
performed a screening for mycoviruses of a collection of Thai isolates of rice
fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia oryzae-sativae, a causal agent of rice aggregated
sheath spot disease. As a result, 36% of tested isolates carried potentially
viral double-stranded RNAs with sizes ranging from 2 to 3 kbp. By conventional
cDNA library construction and RNA-seq, we determined six new alphapartitiviruses 
that infected three isolates: tentatively named Rhizoctonia oryzae-sativae
partitivirus 1 to 6 (RosPV1-6). Furthermore, RT-PCR detection of each virus
revealed their omnipresent nature in different R. oryzae-sativae isolates.
Although virus-curing of basidiomycetous fungi is generally difficult, our
repeated attempts successfully obtained virus-free (for RosPV1, RosPV2, and
uncharacterized partitiviruses), isogenic strain of R. oryzae-sativae TSS190442. 
The virus-cured strain showed slightly faster colony growth on the synthetic
media and severe symptom development on the rice sheath compared to its
virus-infected counterpart. Overall, this study shed light on the distribution of
partitiviruses in R. oryzae-sativae in a paddy environment and exemplified a
virus-curing protocol that may be applicable for other basidiomycetous fungi.
