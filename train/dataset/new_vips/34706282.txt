Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have proven efficacy as gene
therapy vehicles. However, non-specific adsorption of these vectors on solid
surfaces is encountered during production, storage, and administration, as well
as in quantification processes. Such adsorption has been reported to result in
the loss of up to 90% of vector particles and can also result in high variability
in vector genome quantification. In this study, we demonstrate the effective
decrease of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector adsorption by application
of a polyionic hydrophilic complex polymer coating on the surfaces of the tools
used in viral vector quantification analyses [i.e., pipette tips, cryotube vials,
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) plates]. qPCR analyses showed
efficient recovery of vector particles from tools with this coating, with up to
95% of vector particle loss being prevented, leading to a higher transduction
efficiency in vitro. Thus, the tested coating has the potential to be widely used
in material processing in the gene therapy field.
