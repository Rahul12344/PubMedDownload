Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is characterized by an
inflammation with fever, elevated inflammatory markers, conjunctivitis, rash,
impaired coagulation, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac abnormalities that
may progress to multiorgan failure. The presence of a positive COVID-19 antigen
via a PCR test, serological testing for antibodies or close contact with a person
diagnosed with COVID-19 helps differentiate MIS-C from other diseases.
Gastrointestinal symptoms are recognized to be associated with COVID-19 infection
or MIS-C in children, presenting as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal infection
with watery stools, appendicitis, ileitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis, confusing 
the diagnosis with other gastrointestinal diseases. In this case report, we
describe an 11 year old boy with MIS-C, who presents acute phlegmona of the
appendix for which he undergoes appendectomy, accompanied with acute
pancreatitis. These manifestations of MIS-C in our patient resolved without
additional complications after a 2 month follow up. We call attention to MIS-C
presenting in pediatric patients with fever and abdominal pain which might be
caused by appendicitis and pancreatitis, and we recommend abdominal imaging and
additional laboratory investigation to promote earlier diagnosis.
