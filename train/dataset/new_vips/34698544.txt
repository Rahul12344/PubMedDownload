BACKGROUND: The emergence of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2, which causes COVID-19 disease, has been a major public health
challenge and an increase in the feeling of uncertainty of the population, who is
also experiencing an increase in levels of anxiety and fear regarding the
COVID-19 disease.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was the construct and criterion validation 
of the Escala de evaluación de la Ansiedad y MIedo a COVID-19 (AMICO, for its
acronym in Spanish) to measure both constructs in the general Spanish population.
METHODS: Descriptive study of psychometric validation. A field study was carried 
out to execute univariate and bivariate analyses, in addition to the exploratory 
and confirmatory factorial analysis of the scale. For the criteria validity
study, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and sensitivity and specificity
values were calculated.
RESULTS: The study sample was composed of 1036 subjects over 18 years of age, who
resided in Spain, where 56.3% were women with a mean age of 48.11 years
(SD = 15.13). The study of construct validity reported two factors and 16 items, 
with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.92. The scale was concurrently valid with the 
used gold standard and obtained sensitivity values of 90.48% and specificity
values of 76%.
CONCLUSIONS: The AMICO scale is valid and reliable for assessing the level of
anxiety and fear of COVID-19 in the adult Spanish population and is highly
sensitive.
