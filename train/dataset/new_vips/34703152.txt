Introduction: Viral hepatitis is a crucial public health problem in India.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination is a national priority and a key strategy has
been adopted to strengthen the HCV diagnostics services to ensure early and
accurate diagnosis.
Methods: To conduct an economic evaluation of implementing a rapid point-of-care 
screening test for the identification of HCV among the selected key population
under the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme in Tamil Nadu, South India. 
Economic evaluation of a point-of-care screening test for HCV diagnosis among the
key population attending the primary health care centers. A combination of
decision tree and Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of
point-of-care screening test for HCV diagnosis at the primary health care
centers. Total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the intervention and
comparator, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. The 
model parameter uncertainties which would influence the cost-effectiveness
outcome has been evaluated by one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic
sensitivity analysis.
Results: When compared to the tertiary level diagnostic strategy for HCV, the
point-of-care screening for selected key population at primary health care level 
results in a gain of 57 undiscounted QALYs and 38 discounted QALYs, four
undiscounted life years and two discounted life years. The negative ICER of the
new strategy indicates that it is less expensive and more effective compared with
the current HCV diagnosis strategy.
Conclusions: The proposed strategy for HCV diagnosis in the selected key
population in Tamil Nadu is dominant and cost-saving compared to the current
strategy.
