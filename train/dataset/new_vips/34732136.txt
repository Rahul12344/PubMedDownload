BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TE) comprise nearly half of the human genome
and their insertions have profound effects to human genetic diversification and
as well as disease. Despite their abovementioned significance, there is no
consensus on the TE subfamilies that remain active in the human genome. In this
study, we therefore developed a novel statistical test for recently mobile
subfamilies (RMSs), based on patterns of overlap with > 100,000 polymorphic
indels.
RESULTS: Our analysis produced a catalogue of 20 high-confidence RMSs, which
excludes many false positives in public databases. Intriguingly though, it
includes HERV-K, an LTR subfamily previously thought to be extinct. The RMS
catalogue is strongly enriched for contributions to germline genetic disorders
(P = 1.1e-10), and thus constitutes a valuable resource for diagnosing disorders 
of unknown aetiology using targeted TE-insertion screens. Remarkably, RMSs are
also highly enriched for somatic insertions in diverse cancers (P = 2.8e-17),
thus indicating strong correlations between germline and somatic TE mobility.
Using CRISPR/Cas9 deletion, we show that an RMS-derived polymorphic TE insertion 
increased the expression of RPL17, a gene associated with lower survival in liver
cancer. More broadly, polymorphic TE insertions from RMSs were enriched near
genes with allele-specific expression, suggesting widespread effects on gene
regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: By using a novel statistical test we have defined a catalogue of 20 
recently mobile transposable element subfamilies. We illustrate the gene
regulatory potential of RMS-derived polymorphic TE insertions, using CRISPR/Cas9 
deletion in vitro on a specific candidate, as well as by genome wide analysis of 
allele-specific expression. Our study presents novel insights into TE mobility
and regulatory potential and provides a key resource for human disease genetics
and population history studies.
