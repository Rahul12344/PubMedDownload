We isolated a novel coronavirus from a medical team member presenting with fever 
and malaise after travel to Haiti. The virus showed 99.4% similarity with a
recombinant canine coronavirus recently identified in a pneumonia patient in
Malaysia, suggesting that infection with this virus and/or recombinant variants
occurs in multiple locations.
