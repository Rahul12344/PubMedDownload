The widespread increase in multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants is causing a significant health concern in
the United States and worldwide. These variants exhibit increased
transmissibility, cause more severe disease, exhibit evasive immune properties,
impair neutralization by antibodies from vaccinated individuals or convalescence 
sera, and reinfection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
classified SARS-CoV-2 variants into variants of interest, variants of concern,
and variants of high consequence. Currently, four variants of concern (B.1.1.7,
B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2) and several variants of interests (B.1.526, B.1.525,
and P.2) are characterized and are essential for close monitoring. In this
review, we discuss the different SARS-CoV-2 variants, emphasizing variants of
concern circulating the world and highlight the various mutations and how these
mutations affect the characteristics of the virus. In addition, we discuss the
most common vaccines and the various studies concerning the efficacy of these
vaccines against different variants of concern.
