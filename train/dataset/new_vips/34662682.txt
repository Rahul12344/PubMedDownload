The 2020 pandemic has transformed the world and elicited thousands of studies to 
better understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Viral load has been a common measure to
monitor treatment therapies and associate viral dynamics with patient outcomes;
however, methods associated with viral load have varied across studies. These
variations have the potential to sacrifice the accuracy of findings as they often
do not account for inter-assay variation or variation across samples. In a
retrospective study of nasopharyngeal samples, we found a significant amount of
variation within the DNA and RNA targets; for example, across time within a
single patient, there was an average of a 32-fold change. Further, we explore the
impacts of host normalization on 94 clinical samples using the TGen Quantitative 
SARS-CoV-2 assay, finding that without host normalization samples with the same
viral concentration can have up to 100-fold variation in the viral load.
