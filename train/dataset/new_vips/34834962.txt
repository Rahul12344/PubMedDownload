Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are integrated in the genome of all pigs,
and some of them are able to infect human cells. Therefore, PERVs pose a risk for
xenotransplantation, the transplantation of pig cells, tissues, or organ to
humans in order to alleviate the shortage of human donor organs. Up to 2021, a
huge body of knowledge about PERVs has been accumulated regarding their biology, 
including replication, recombination, origin, host range, and immunosuppressive
properties. Until now, no PERV transmission has been observed in clinical trials 
transplanting pig islet cells into diabetic humans, in preclinical trials
transplanting pig cells and organs into nonhuman primates with remarkable long
survival times of the transplant, and in infection experiments with several
animal species. Nevertheless, in order to prevent virus transmission to the
recipient, numerous strategies have been developed, including selection of
PERV-C-free animals, RNA interference, antiviral drugs, vaccination, and genome
editing. Furthermore, at present there are no more experimental approaches to
evaluate the full risk until we move to the clinic.
