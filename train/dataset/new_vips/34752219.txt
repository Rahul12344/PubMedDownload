Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
hospitalized patients and in the immunocompromised population. This article
reviews the current epidemiology of nosocomial fungal infections in adult
patients, with an emphasis on invasive candidiasis (IC) and invasive
aspergillosis (IA). Included are descriptions of nosocomial infections caused by 
Candida auris, an emerging pathogen, and IC- and IA-associated with coronavirus
disease 2019. The characteristics and availability of newer nonculture-based
tests for identification of nosocomial fungal pathogens are discussed. Recently
published recommendations and guidelines for the control and prevention of these 
nosocomial fungal infections are summarized.
