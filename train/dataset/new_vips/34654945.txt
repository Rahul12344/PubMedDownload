INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that has caused a
global pandemic. Health workers (HWs) are major players in the fight against this
infection and are occupationally exposed to the virus in the course of their
work. In this context, this study presents surveillance data on 1714 workers in a
hospital center in the south of France for the period from March 17 to April 20, 
2020.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptomatic HWs, contact cases and those with high anxiety
were tested. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was performed by RT-PCR after nasopharyngeal
sampling.
RESULTS: During this period, 30.4% of hospital staff received 3028 nasal swabs.
Of these, 8.0% were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 positive HWs, 
24.3% were asymptomatic. Among COVID unit and non COVID unit, the positive HWs
for SARS-CoV-2 were, respectively, 5.8% and 8.2% (p = 0.2). HWs over 50 years of 
age were less likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 (3.8%) than other younger HWs 
(9.1%) (p < 0.001). No serious cases of COVID-19 were reported in our population 
during this period.
DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that HWs who tested positive for COVID-19 are
often asymptomatic. Therefore, PPE is pivotal to prevent HWs to patients and HWs 
to HWs transmission during workshifts. Contact tracing and screening is essential
to limit the spread of the virus within the hospital. On the other hand, HWs
working in COVID-19 units are not more often infected probably because they have 
a higher risk awareness than other HWs.
