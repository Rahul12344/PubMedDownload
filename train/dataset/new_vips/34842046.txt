AbstractSARS-CoV-2 was first reported circulating in human populations in
December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic. Recent history involving
SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks have demonstrated the significant role of
intermediate hosts in viral maintenance and transmission. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal species
has been demonstrated, and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated that
deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer (WTD) are amongst
the most abundant and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the US. 
Recently, WTD fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present
study, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult
WTD. In addition, we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates,
representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the alpha variant of concern (VOC)
B.1.1.7 through co-infection of WTD. Next-generation sequencing was used to
determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and
contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult WTD are highly
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct
contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally, we determined that
the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A
isolate in WTD, as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and
oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals, and from virus present
in tissues of principal infected deer, fetuses and contact animals.
