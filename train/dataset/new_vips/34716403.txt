Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe respiratory tract 
infections in children. To uncover new antiviral therapies, we developed a live
cell-based high content screening approach for rapid identification of RSV
inhibitors and characterized five drug classes which inhibit the virus. Among the
molecular targets for each hit, there was a strong functional enrichment in lipid
metabolic pathways. Modulation of lipid metabolites by statins, a key hit from
our screen, decreases the production of infectious virus through a combination of
cholesterol and isoprenoid-mediated effects. Notably, RSV infection globally
upregulates host protein prenylation, including the prenylation of Rho GTPases.
Treatment by statins or perillyl alcohol, a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor, 
reduces infection in vitro. Of the Rho GTPases assayed in our study, a loss in
Rac1 activity strongly inhibits the virus through a decrease in F protein surface
expression. Our findings provide new insight into the importance of host lipid
metabolism to RSV infection and highlight geranylgeranyltransferases as an
antiviral target for therapeutic development.
