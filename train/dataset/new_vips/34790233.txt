Fake news is challenging to detect due to mixing accurate and inaccurate
information from reliable and unreliable sources. Social media is a data source
that is not trustworthy all the time, especially in the COVID-19 outbreak. During
the COVID-19 epidemic, fake news is widely spread. The best way to deal with this
is early detection. Accordingly, in this work, we have proposed a hybrid deep
learning model that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term
memory (LSTM) to detect COVID-19 fake news. The proposed model consists of some
layers: an embedding layer, a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, an LSTM
layer, a flatten layer, a dense layer, and an output layer. For experimental
results, three COVID-19 fake news datasets are used to evaluate six machine
learning models, two deep learning models, and our proposed model. The machine
learning models are DT, KNN, LR, RF, SVM, and NB, while the deep learning models 
are CNN and LSTM. Also, four matrices are used to validate the results: accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-measure. The conducted experiments show that the
proposed model outperforms the six machine learning models and the two deep
learning models. Consequently, the proposed system is capable of detecting the
fake news of COVID-19 significantly.
