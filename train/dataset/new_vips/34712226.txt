Chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a trigger factor for the development
of immunosenescence and negatively impacts the immune response to influenza virus
vaccination (IVV) in older adults. However, the role of physical exercise
training in this context is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to
investigate whether the regular practice of combined exercise training can
improve the specific antibody response to IVV in CMV-seropositive older adults.
Eighty older adults were distributed into two groups-non-practitioners (NP, n =
31, age = 74.06 ± 6.4 years) and practitioners of combined exercise training
(CET, n = 49, age = 71.7 ± 5.8 years)-for at least 12 months. Both volunteer
groups were submitted to IVV and blood samples were collected before (pre) and 30
days after (post) the vaccination. Concerning the specific antibody response to
IVV, higher serum levels of specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) were found in the CET
group post- than pre-vaccination (p < 0.01), whereas higher levels of specific
immunoglobulin M (IgM) were observed both in the NP (p < 0.05) and CET (p <
0.001) groups post-vaccination as compared to the pre-vaccination values. Serum
levels of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) for IVV and CMV, as well as interleukin
6 (IL-6) and IL-10, were similar between the time points evaluated. However, the 
IL-10/IL-6 ratio post-vaccination was higher (p < 0.05) in the CET group than
that before vaccination. Negative correlations were observed between the specific
IgG levels for IVV and CMV only in the CET group, both pre- and post-vaccination.
In addition, negative correlations were found between IL-10 and specific IgG for 
CMV in all volunteer groups pre- and post-vaccination, whereas a positive
correlation between IL-10 and specific-IgG for IVV pre- and post-vaccination was 
observed in the CET group. In addition, with the hemagglutination inhibition
(HAI) assay, it was found that 32.2% of the NP group and 32.6% of the CET group
were responders to IVV and displayed reductions in the CMV serostatus (p < 0.05
and p < 0.001, respectively) and increases in naive and effector CD8+ T cells
post-vaccination (p < 0.01). However, only the responders from the CET group
showed significant reductions in the ratio of effector to naive CD8+ T cells (p <
0.05) and increased IL-10 levels post-vaccination (p < 0.001). In summary, this
study demonstrates that the improvement in the response to IVV in
CMV-seropositive older adults was related to an anti-inflammatory status and
enhancement of naive CD8+ T cells, particularly associated with regular practice 
of CET.
