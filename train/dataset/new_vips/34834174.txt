In 2019, the world suffered from the emergence of COVID-19 infection, one of the 
most difficult pandemics in recent history. Millions of confirmed deaths from
this pandemic have been reported worldwide. This disaster was caused by
SARS-CoV-2, which is the last discovered member of the family of Coronaviridae.
Various studies have shown that natural compounds have effective antiviral
properties against coronaviruses by inhibiting multiple viral targets, including 
spike proteins and viral enzymes. This review presents the classification and a
detailed explanation of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular characteristics and
structure-function relationships. We present all currently available crystal
structures of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins and emphasized on the crystal
structure of different virus proteins and the binding modes of their ligands.
This review also discusses the various therapeutic approaches for COVID-19
treatment and available vaccinations. In addition, we highlight and compare the
existing data about natural compounds extracted from algae, fungi, plants, and
scorpion venom that were used as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Moreover, we discuss the repurposing of select approved therapeutic agents that
have been used in the treatment of other viruses.
