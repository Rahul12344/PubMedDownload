Background: Recent viral pandemics have challenged the global scientific
community to immediately develop new therapies. The fastest approach to develop
these is to explore natural products for their efficacies and repurposing of
already approved molecules. Keeping global emergency in view, researchers at
Shreepad Shree Vallabh SSV Phytopharmaceuticals developed the CurvicTM (SSV-003) 
formulation, comprising of curcumin, vitamin C, vitamin K2-7, selenomethionine
and Zinc.
Methods: Researchers have systematically studied the SSV-003 formulation for its 
in vitro efficacy against influenza A virus (H1N1) (ATCC® VR-219™) and human beta
coronavirus (ATCC® VR1558™) using MDCK & HCT-8 cell lines, respectively, in vivo 
efficacy studies of SSV-003 on influenza A virus infected Balb/c mice, and acute 
toxicity studies as per OECD guidelines.
Results: Formulation SSV-003 showed potent antiviral activities against both the 
selected virus strains. Its IC50 was significantly lessthan ribavirin against
influenza A-H1N1-VR219, with no cytopathic effect. SSV-003 showed IC50 of 2.26
µg/mL against human beta coronavirus, which was near to the IC50 of ribavirin
(2.25 µg/mL) and was less than remedisivir (6.23 µg/mL) with no cytopathic
effect. In-vivo studies in an influenza A virus infected mice model showed a
significantly higher TCID50 value in the infected control group as compared to
test groups. Animals treated with SSV-003 showed a dose dependent decrease in
TCID50. Formulation SSV-003 at the dose of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg/kg body
weight showed 85.9%, 94.6%, and 95.1% decreases in infection as compared to the
infected control group. Dose-dependent significant increases in CD4+, CD8+
counts, IgG and IgM levels were observed in SSV-003 treated groups as compared to
the infected control group and remedisivir treated group. In the acute oral
toxicity study, no mortality or morbidity was observed.
Conclusion: The data from these preclinical studies provide strong evidence of
potent and safe antiviral and immunomodulatory activity of SSV-003.
