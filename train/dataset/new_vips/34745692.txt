Introduction: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the
circulation of seasonal influenza virus declined globally and remained below
previous seasonal levels. We analyzed the results of the epidemiology, antigenic,
and genetic characteristics, and antiviral susceptibilities of seasonal influenza
viruses isolated from the mainland of China during October 5, 2020 through
September 5, 2021, to better assess the risk of influenza during subsequent
influenza season in 2021-2022.
Methods: Positive rates of influenza virus detection during this period were
based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection by the Chinese
National Influenza Surveillance Network laboratories, and isolated viruses from
influenza positive samples were submitted to the Chinese National Influenza
Center. Antigenic analyses for influenza viruses were conducted using the
hemagglutination inhibition assay. Next-generation sequencing was used for
genetic analyses. Viruses were tested for resistance to antiviral medications
using a phenotypic assay and next-generation sequencing.
Results: In southern China, the influenza positivity rate was elevated especially
after March 2021 and was higher than the same period the previous year with the
COVID-19 pandemic. In northern China, influenza positive rate peaked at Week 18
in 2021 and has declined since then. Nearly all isolated viruses were B/Victoria 
lineage viruses during the study period, and 37.3% of these viruses are
antigenically similar to the reference viruses representing the vaccine
components for the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. 
All seasonal influenza viruses were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors and
endonuclease inhibitors.
Conclusions: Influenza activity has gradually increased in the mainland of China 
in 2021, although the intensity of activity is still lower than before the
COVID-19 pandemic. The diversity of circulating influenza types/subtypes
decreased, with the vast majority being B/Victoria lineage viruses. The
surveillance data from this study suggest that we should strengthen influenza
surveillance during the upcoming traditional influenza season. It also provided
evidence for vaccine recommendations and prevention and control of influenza and 
clinical use of antiviral drugs.
