Ranging from bacterial cell adhesion over viral cell entry to human innate
immunity, glycan-binding proteins or lectins are abound in nature. Widely used as
staining and characterization reagents in cell biology and crucial for
understanding the interactions in biological systems, lectins are a focal point
of study in glycobiology. Yet the sheer breadth and depth of specificity for
diverse oligosaccharide motifs has made studying lectins a largely piecemeal
approach, with few options to generalize. Here, LectinOracle, a model combining
transformer-based representations for proteins and graph convolutional neural
networks for glycans to predict their interaction, is presented. Using a curated 
data set of 564,647 unique protein-glycan interactions, it is shown that
LectinOracle predictions agree with literature-annotated specificities for a wide
range of lectins. Using a range of specialized glycan arrays, it is shown that
LectinOracle predictions generalize to new glycans and lectins, with qualitative 
and quantitative agreement with experimental data. It is further demonstrated
that LectinOracle can be used to improve lectin classification, accelerate lectin
directed evolution, predict epidemiological outcomes in the context of influenza 
virus, and analyze whole lectomes in host-microbe interactions. It is envisioned 
that the herein presented platform will advance both the study of lectins and
their role in (glyco)biology.
