BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS are behaviorally
challenging for persons, vaccine and drug companies, and donors.
METHODS: In 3 linked games in which a disease may or may not be contracted, N
persons choose risky or safe behavior (game 1). Two vaccine companies (game 2)
and 2 drug companies (game 3) choose whether to develop vaccines and drugs. Each 
person chooses whether to buy 1 vaccine (if no disease contraction) or 1 drug (if
disease contraction). A donor subsidizes vaccine and drug developments and
purchases. Nature probabilistically chooses disease contraction, recovery versus 
death with and without each drug, and whether vaccines and drugs are developed
successfully. COVID-19 data are used for parameter estimation.
RESULTS: Each person chooses risky behavior if its utility outweighs safe
behavior, accounting for nature's probability of disease contraction which
depends on how many are vaccinated. Each person buys a vaccine or drug if the
companies produce them and if their utilities (accounting for side effects and
virus mutation) outweigh the costs, which may be subsidized by a sponsor.
DISCUSSION: Drug purchases depend on nature's recovery probability exceeding the 
probability in the absence of a drug. Each company develops and produces a
vaccine or drug if nature's probability of successful development is high, if
sufficiently many persons buy the vaccine or drug at a sales price that
sufficiently exceeds the production price, and if the donor sponsors.
CONCLUSION: Accounting for all players' interlinked decisions allowing 14
outcomes, which is challenging without a game theoretic analysis, the donor
maximizes all persons' expected utilities at the societal level to adjust how
persons' purchases and the companies' development and production are subsidized.
HIGHLIGHTS: A game theoretic approach can help explain the production decisions
of vaccine and drug companies, and the decisions of persons and a donor, impacted
by Nature.In 3 linked games, N persons choose risky behavior if its utility
outweighs safe behavior.Vaccine and drug companies develop vaccines and drugs
sponsored by a donor if profitable, allowing 14 outcomes.
