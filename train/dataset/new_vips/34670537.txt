BACKGROUND: Quantifying excess deaths and their impact on life expectancy at
birth (e0) provide a more comprehensive understanding of the burden of
coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality. The study aims to comprehend
the repercussions of the burden of COVID-19 disease on the life expectancy at
birth and inequality in age at death in India.
METHODS: The mortality schedule of COVID-19 disease in the pandemic year 2020 was
considered one of the causes of death in the category of other infectious
diseases in addition to other 21 causes of death in the non-pandemic year 2019 in
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data. The measures e0 and Gini coefficient at 
age zero (G0) and then sex differences in e0 and G0 over time were analysed by
assessing the age-specific contributions based on the application of
decomposition analyses in the entire period of 2010-2020.
RESULTS: The e0 for men and women decline from 69.5 and 72.0 years in 2019 to
67.5 and 69.8 years, respectively, in 2020. The e0 shows a drop of approximately 
2.0 years in 2020 when compared to 2019. The sex differences in e0 and G0 are
negatively skewed towards men. The trends in e0 and G0 value reveal that its
value in 2020 is comparable to that in the early 2010s. The age group of
35-79 years showed a remarkable negative contribution to Δe0 and ΔG0. By causes
of death, the COVID-19 disease has contributed - 1.5 and - 9.5%, respectively,
whereas cardiovascular diseases contributed the largest value of was 44.6 and
45.9%, respectively, to sex differences in e0 and G0 in 2020. The outcomes reveal
a significant impact of excess deaths caused by the COVID-19 disease on mortality
patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has negative repercussions on e0 and G0 in the
pandemic year 2020. It has severely affected the distribution of age at death in 
India, resulting in widening the sex differences in e0 and G0. The COVID-19
disease demonstrates its potential to cancel the gains of six to eight years in
e0 and five years in G0 and has slowed the mortality transition in India.
