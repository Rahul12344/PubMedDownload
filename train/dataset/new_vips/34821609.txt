As the world tries to cope with the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and emerging variants of the virus, COVID-19 vaccination has become an even more 
critical tool toward normalcy. The effectiveness of the vaccination program and
specifically vaccine uptake and coverage, however, is a function of an
individual's knowledge and individual opinion about the disease and available
vaccines. This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and resulting
community practice(s) associated with the new COVID-19 variants and vaccines in
Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Malaysia, Zimbabwe, and the USA. A cross-sectional
web-based Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey was administered to
respondents living in six different countries using a structured and multi-item
questionnaire. Survey questions were translated into English, Spanish, and Malay 
to accommodate the local language in each country. Associations between KAP and a
range of explanatory variables were assessed using univariate and multiple
logistic regression. A total of 781 responses were included in the final
analysis. The Knowledge score mean was 24 (out of 46), Attitude score 28.9 (out
of 55), and Practice score 7.3 (out of 11). Almost 65% of the respondents
reported being knowledgeable about COVID-19 variants and vaccination, 55%
reported a positive attitude toward available COVID-19 vaccines, and 85% reported
engaging in practices that supported COVID-19 vaccination. From the multiple
logistic models, we found post-graduate education (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.74)
and an age range 45-54 years (AOR = 5.81, 95% CI: 2.30-14.69) to be significantly
associated with reported COVID-19 knowledge. In addition, positive Attitude
scores were associated with respondents living in Zimbabwe (AOR = 4.49, 95% CI:
2.04-9.90) and positive Practice scores were found to be associated with people
from India (AOR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.15-11.74) and high school education (AOR =
2.16, 95% CI: 1.07-4.38). This study contributes to the identification of
socio-demographic factors associated with poor knowledge, attitudes, and
practices relating to COVID-19 variants and vaccines. It presents an opportunity 
for collaboration with diverse communities to address COVID-19 misinformation and
common sources of vaccine hesitancy (i.e., knowledge, attitudes, and practices).
