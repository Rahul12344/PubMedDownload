Immature HIV virions harbor a lattice of Gag molecules with significant ordering 
in CA-NTD, CA-CTD and SP1 regions. This ordering plays a major role during HIV
maturation. To test the condition in which the Gag lattice forms in vivo, we
assembled virus like particles (VLPs) by expressing only HIV Gag in mammalian
cells. Here we show that these VLPs incorporate a similar number of Gag molecules
compared to immature HIV virions. However, within these VLPs, Gag molecules
diffuse with a pseudo-diffusion rate of 10 nm2/s, this pseudo-diffusion is
abrogated in the presence of melittin and is sensitive to mutations within the
SP1 region. Using cryotomography, we show that unlike immature HIV virions, in
the Gag lattice of VLPs the CA-CTD and SP1 regions are significantly less
ordered. Our observations suggest that within immature HIV virions, other viral
factors in addition to Gag, contribute to ordering in the CA-CTD and SP1 regions.
