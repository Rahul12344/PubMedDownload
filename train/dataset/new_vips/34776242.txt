OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between hysterectomy and ovarian cancer,
and to understand how hormone therapy (HT) use and endometriosis affect this
association.
METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of self-reported data from 11
case-control studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Women
with (n = 5350) and without ovarian cancer (n = 7544) who never used HT or
exclusively used either estrogen-only therapy (ET) or estrogen+progestin therapy 
(EPT) were included. Risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer adjusted for
duration of ET and EPT use and stratified on history of endometriosis was
determined using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Overall and among women without endometriosis, there was a positive
association between ovarian cancer risk and hysterectomy (OR = 1.19, 95% CI
1.09-1.31 and OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32, respectively), but no association upon
adjusting for duration of ET and EPT use (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.94-1.16 and
OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.95-1.18, respectively). Among women with a history of
endometriosis, there was a slight inverse association between hysterectomy and
ovarian cancer risk (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.69-1.26), but this association became
stronger and statistically significant after adjusting for duration of ET and EPT
use (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: The hysterectomy-ovarian cancer association is complex and cannot be
understood without considering duration of ET and EPT use and history of
endometriosis. Failure to take these exposures into account in prior studies
casts doubt on their conclusions. Overall, hysterectomy is not risk-reducing for 
ovarian cancer, however the inverse association among women with endometriosis
warrants further investigation.
