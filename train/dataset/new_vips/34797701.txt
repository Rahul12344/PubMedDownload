After almost a decade of using CRISPR/Cas9 systems to edit target genes,
CRISPR/Cas9 and related technologies are rapidly moving to clinical trials.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which causes severe liver disease, cannot be cleared by 
modern antivirals, but represents an ideal target for CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Early 
studies demonstrated very high antiviral potency of CRISPR/Cas9 and supported its
use for developing a cure against chronic HBV infection. This review discusses
the key issues that must be solved to make CRISPR/Cas9 an anti-HBV therapy.
