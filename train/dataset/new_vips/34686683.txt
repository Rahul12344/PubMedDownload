Powassan virus (POWV) is a neuroinvasive flavivirus transmitted to mammals by the
bite of ixodid ticks. In this study, we sought to investigate the impact of tick 
salivary gland extract (SGE) on POWV neuroinvasion. BALB/c mice were footpad
inoculated with either a high dose or a low dose of POWV, with and without Ixodes
scapularis salivary gland extract. Brain and spinal cord were extracted daily,
and immunohistochemical techniques were used for temporal tracking of POWV
antigen. The temporal pattern of POWV staining showed a caudal to rostral spread 
of POWV in the brains of mice from both high dose infection groups. For the high 
dose infection groups, the presence of tick SGE did not influence the spread of
POWV in the brain. Mice infected with the low dose of virus alone did not present
POWV staining in the brain; however, in the presence of SGE, low dose infected
mice presented scattered foci of POWV-infected cells throughout the brain. This
study shows that tick SGE facilitates POWV neuroinvasion when mice are infected
with the lower dose of POWV. We also found two patterns of central nervous system
invasion that were directly influenced by the dose of POWV administered.
