BACKGROUND: The node of the first fruiting branch (NFFB) is an important
precocious trait in cotton. Many studies have been conducted on the localization 
of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes related to fiber quality and yield,
but there has been little attention to traits related to early maturity,
especially the NFFB, in cotton.
RESULTS: To identify the QTL associated with the NFFB in cotton, a BC4F2
population comprising 278 individual plants was constructed. The parents and two 
DNA bulks for high and low NFFB were whole genome sequenced, and 243.8 Gb of
clean nucleotide data were generated. A total of 449,302 polymorphic SNPs and
135,353 Indels between two bulks were identified for QTL-seq. Seventeen QTLs were
detected and localized on 11 chromosomes in the cotton genome, among which two
QTLs (qNFFB-Dt2-1 and qNFFB-Dt3-3) were located in hotspots. Two candidate genes 
(GhAPL and GhHDA5) related to the NFFB were identified using quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) experiments in
this study. Both genes exhibited higher expression levels in the early-maturing
cotton material RIL182 during flower bud differentiation, and the silencing of
GhAPL and GhHDA5 delayed the flowering time and increased the NFFB compared to
those of VA plants in cotton.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study preliminarily found that GhAPL and GhHDA5 are related to
the early maturity in cotton. The findings provide a basis for the further
functional verification of candidate genes related to the NFFB and contribute to 
the study of early maturity in cotton.
