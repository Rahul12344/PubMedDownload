Background: The global pandemic COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
has already caused about 1.4 million deaths, and to date, there are no effective 
or direct antiviral vaccines. Some vaccines are in the last stages of testing.
Overall mortality rates vary between countries, for example, from a minimum of
0.05% in Singapore to a maximum of 9.75 in Mexico; however, mortality and
severity of COVID-19 are higher in the elderly and in those with comorbidities
already present such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
Main text: Recent evidence has shown that an underlying liver disease can also be
a risk factor, and SARS-CoV-2 itself can cause direct or indirect damage to liver
tissue through multisystem inflammation generated especially in the more severe
stages. In the current pandemic, liver dysfunction has been observed in 14-53% of
patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, drugs administered during infection
may be an additional factor of liver damage. The mechanism of cellular
penetration of the virus that occurs by viral entry is through the receptors of
the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2) host that are abundantly present in
type II pneumocytes, heart cells, but also liver cholangiocytes.
Conclusion: In this manuscript, we describe the clinical management aimed at
preserving the liver or reducing the damage caused by COVID-19 and anti-COVID-19 
drug treatments.
