Despite antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses being
implicated in protection from HIV-1 infection, there is limited evidence that
they control virus replication. The high mutability of HIV-1 enables the virus to
rapidly adapt, and thus evidence of viral escape is a very sensitive approach to 
demonstrate the importance of this response. To enable us to deconvolute ADCC
escape from neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, we identified individuals soon
after infection with detectable ADCC responses, but no nAb responses. We
evaluated the kinetics of ADCC and nAb responses, and viral escape, in five
recently HIV-1-infected individuals. In one individual we detected viruses that
escaped from ADCC responses but were sensitive to nAbs. In the remaining four
participants, we did not find evidence of viral evolution exclusively associated 
with ADCC-mediating non-neutralizing Abs (nnAbs). However, in all individuals
escape from nAbs was rapid, occurred at very low titers, and in three of five
cases we found evidence of viral escape before detectable nAb responses. These
data show that ADCC-mediating nnAbs can drive immune escape in early infection,
but that nAbs were far more effective. This suggests that if ADCC responses have 
a protective role, their impact is limited after systemic virus dissemination.
