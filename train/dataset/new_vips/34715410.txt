In the current issue of the Biomedical Journal we gain an insight into the
regeneration of liver tissue and how an over-the-counter supplement, stem cells
and two plant extracts counteract liver damage. Furthermore the advances against 
hepatitis C virus are presented, the role of long non-coding RNA elucidated as
well as the potential of an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor. In another
contribution, the definition and evolutionary impact of copy number variants is
clarified. Also, the polymorphism of a scaffolding caspase is investigated. We
furthermore learn about the relation between SARS-CoV2 mutants in dependence of
geography and explore the challenges of telemedicine in a complex healthcare
field. A novel approach to engineering artificial grafts is presented, the
challenges of total knee arthroplasty discussed as well as a possible mean of
sinus floor elevation for dental implants. At last the concept of flipped
classroom is scrutinized in terms of usefulness for a hospital in Taiwan.
