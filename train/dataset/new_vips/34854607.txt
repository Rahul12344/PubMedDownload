BACKGROUND: During winter, the influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus season, 
children are often seen in the emergency department with fever and respiratory
symptoms.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 2-year-old girl with fever, dyspnea
and signs of heart failure during physical examination. Echocardiogram showed a
large amount of pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade.
Pericardiocentesis showed 200 ml purulent liquid. Surgical drainage was
performed. However pericardial effusion recurred. Because constrictive
pericarditis was feared, a pericardiectomy was performed after which the patient 
recovered. Cultures showed Haemophilus influenzae type b and the patient was
treated with amoxicillin for 4 weeks in total.
CONCLUSION: Fever and dyspnea may also be caused by a problem outside the
respiratory system. With physical examination a cardiac cause, such as
pericarditis, can be detected. An ECG is easily obtained and can help in the
differential diagnosis. An echocardiogram can confirm the diagnosis.
