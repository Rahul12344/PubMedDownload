BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between
COVID-19 preventive behaviors, as the dependent variable, with risk perception,
coping style and sense of coherence, as independent variables, in older people
living in the community.
METHODS: An observational design for predictive model development. This study was
reported following the STROBE statement. The subjects were people over 65 years
of age living in the community. Data collection included sociodemographic
variables related to COVID-19, risk perception and types, coping styles in the
face of contagion, sense of coherence, and preventive behaviors in the face of
COVID-19. The data collection period was from November 2020 to January 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 305 people participated in this study (71.5% women, mean age 
71.34 years; 6.9% suffered from COVID-19 and 44.3% knew someone close to them who
suffered from the virus). The coping style variables problem-focused,
emotion-focused, and sense of coherence subscales Significance and manageability 
explained 17% of the variable preventive behaviors against COVID-19. There were
statistically significant differences by gender in all subscales, with women
scoring higher in all of them; Conclusions: Men with low risk perception,
extrinsic risk perception, and low sense of coherence presented worse COVID-19
preventive behaviors. It would be interesting to develop specific prevention and 
health education campaigns for this population.
