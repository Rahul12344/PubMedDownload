EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are common in hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with T-cell-depleted grafts, but are extremely
rare in HSCT patients with T-cell-replete grafts with post-transplant
cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Here we present the cases of two pediatric patients who 
developed EBV-related LPD after T-cell-replete haplo-HSCT with PTCy. One of these
is the first reported case of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU)
developing after PTCy. EBV-related diseases are rare in T-cell-replete haplo-HSCT
patients with PTCy. However, in patients with risk factors, it is reasonable to
screen for EBV viremia for LPD.
