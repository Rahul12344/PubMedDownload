PURPOSE: To assess and improve school nurse knowledge of HPV-associated cancers.
DESIGN: An experimental quality improvement study.
METHODS: At a continuing education regional conference, an interactive HPV
education session was provided. Pre- and post-education surveys were completed by
attendees.
FINDINGS: After the educational intervention, 89.9% of nurses indicated a change 
in knowledge and 83.2% indicated a planned change in practice.
CONCLUSIONS: An education intervention aimed at school nurses can be impactful in
broadening the understanding of HPV oncogenesis.
CLINICAL EVIDENCE: Educational interventions can be a strategy to increase school
nurse knowledge and subsequently patient knowledge about HPV associated cancers.
