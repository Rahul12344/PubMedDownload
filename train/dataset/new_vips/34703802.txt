Since the widespread introduction of oral and live attenuated rotavirus vaccines 
around the world in 2009, the impacts of disease burden and the effects of
disease reduction in developing countries have been proven. However, in low and
middle-income countries, the vaccine efficacy is somewhat lower than in developed
countries due to differences in nutritional conditions, microbial environments of
individuals, and other factors. In addition, as oral, live vaccines have been
found to be associated with rare but serious side effects, the development of a
next-generation vaccine with safety, improved effectiveness, and ease of storage 
is currently underway. New vaccine strain developed by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in the United States are undergoing preclinical testing of
efficacy, antigen dose, and administration route in the form of a heat-treated
inactive vaccine, and a recombinant protein-based trivalent subunit vaccine
developed by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health is undergoing
clinical trial in phase III. Several research groups are also developing
non-replicating protein-based rotavirus vaccines using virus-like particles and
nanoparticles. This review provides a brief overview of the development status
and technology of parenteral, non-live rotavirus vaccines worldwide.
