BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants belonging to Orthohepevirus species 
A (HEV-A) are the primary cause of human hepatitis E. However, we previously
reported that Orthohepevirus C (HEV-C1), a divergent HEV variant commonly found
in rats, also causes hepatitis in humans. Here, we present a
clinical-epidemiological investigation of human HEV-C1 infections detected in
Hong Kong, with an emphasis on outcomes in immunocompromised individuals..
METHODS: A surveillance system for detecting human HEV-C1 infections was
established in Hong Kong. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HEV-C1 
cases identified via this system between August 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020
were retrieved. Phylogenetic analysis of HEV-C1 strain sequences was performed.
Infection outcomes of immunocompromised individuals with HEV-A and HEV-C1
infections were analyzed.
RESULTS: HEV-C1 accounted for 8/53 (15.1%) RT-PCR confirmed hepatitis E
infections in Hong Kong during the study period, raising the total number of
HEV-C1 infections detected in the city to 16. Two distinct HEV-C1 strain groups
caused human infections. Patients were elderly and/or immunocompromised; half
tested negative for HEV IgM. Cumulatively, HEV-C1 accounted for 9/21 (42.9%)
cases of hepatitis E recorded in immunocompromised patients in Hong Kong.
Immunocompromised HEV-C1 patients progressed to persistent hepatitis at similar
rates (7/9; 77.8%) as HEV-A patients (10/12; 75%). HEV-C1 patients responded to
oral ribavirin although response to first course was sometimes poor or delayed.
CONCLUSIONS: Dedicated RT-PCR-based surveillance detected human HEV-C1 cases that
evade conventional hepatitis E diagnostic testing. Immunosuppressed
HEV-C1-infected patients frequently progress to persistent HEV-C1 infection for
which ribavirin is a suitable treatment option.
