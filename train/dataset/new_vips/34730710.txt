OBJECTIVES: to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents of
the Greater Vitória region living in subnormal and non-subnormal agglomerates,
and to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of total residents
(infected and not infected with SARS-CoV-2) between them.
METHODS: Population-based prevalence study conducted by serological testing in
2020, with a study unit in households in Greater Vitória, grouped into census
tracts classified as sub-normal agglomerates and non-sub-normal agglomerates. The
two groups were compared in terms of prevalence and associated factors. The
significance level adopted was 5%.
RESULTS: The prevalence found in the sub-normal clusters was 12.05% (95%CI
9.59-14.50), and in the non-sub-normal clusters 10.23% (95%CI 7.97-12.50) this
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.273). Comparing the
sociodemographic characteristics, more people who declare themselves to be of
mixed race were found in the sub-normal clusters, a higher percentage of
illiterates and people with only elementary education, greater number of
residents per household, longer stay in public transportation, sharing a bathroom
with another household, fewer bedrooms per residence and higher frequency of
irregular water supply when compared to non-sub-normal clusters (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological characteristics of sub-normal clusters'
residents show the social inequalities that can hinder control measures in a
pandemic situation.
