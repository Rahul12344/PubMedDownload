BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has claimed nearly 900,000 lives
worldwide and infected more than 27 million people. Researchers worldwide are
studying ways to decrease SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 related deaths.
Several studies found altitude having a negative association with both COVID-19
incidence and deaths. Ecuadorian data was used to explore the relationship
between altitude and COVID-19.
METHODS: This is an ecological study examining province-level data. To explore a 
relationship between altitude and COVID-19, this study utilized publicly
available COVID-19 data and population statistics. ANOVA, correlation statistics,
and a multivariate linear model explored the relationship between different
Ecuadorian altitudes against incidence, mortality, and case-fatality rates.
Population statistics attributed to COVID-19 were included in the linear model to
control for confounding factors.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in the regions of
Amazónica, Sierra, Costa of Ecuador for incidence, mortality, and case fatality
rates, suggesting an association between altitude and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and
COVID-19 disease severity (p-value ≤0.05). In univariate analysis, altitude had a
negative association to mortality rate with a 1-unit change in altitude resulting
in the decrease of 0.006 units in mortality rate (p-value = 0.03). The multiple
linear models adjusted for population statistics showed a statistically
significant negative association of altitude with mortality rate (p-value = 0.01)
with a 1-unit change in altitude resulting in the decrease in mortality rate by
0.015 units. Overall, the model helped in explaining 50% (R2 = 0.4962) of the
variance in mortality rate.
CONCLUSION: Altitude may have an effect on COVID-19 mortality rates. However,
based on our model and R2 value, the relationship between our variables of
interest and COVID-19 mortality may be nonlinear. More research is needed to
understand why altitude may have a protective effect against COVID-19 mortality
and how this may be applicable in a clinical setting.
