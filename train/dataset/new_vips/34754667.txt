Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome in which widespread
activation of the immune system leads to a state of excessive inflammation
causing tissue damage. While this condition is mainly established in the
pediatric population; due to its rarity, physicians often do not suspect this
condition in adults. However, while diagnostic criteria are based on protocols
tailored for the pediatric society, recognizing this condition in a timely manner
in adults is utterly important to prevent a dismal prognosis. In instances where 
a concomitant rheumatological disorder is present, the syndrome is referred to as
macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). This report describes a case of an adult
patient who presented with mucosal bleeding and abdominal pain who was later
diagnosed with MAS.
