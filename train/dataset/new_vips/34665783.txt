reappear after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Understanding the presence and durability of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the
airways is required to provide insights into the ability of individuals to
neutralize the virus locally and prevent viral spread. Here, we longitudinally
assessed both systemic and airway immune responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in a
clinically well-characterized cohort of 147 infected individuals representing the
full spectrum of COVID-19 severity, from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease.
In addition, we evaluated how SARS-CoV-2 vaccination influenced the antibody
responses in a subset of these individuals during convalescence as compared with 
naive individuals. Not only systemic but also airway antibody responses
correlated with the degree of COVID-19 disease severity. However, although
systemic IgG levels were durable for up to 8 months, airway IgG and IgA declined 
significantly within 3 months. After vaccination, there was an increase in both
systemic and airway antibodies, in particular IgG, often exceeding the levels
found during acute disease. In contrast, naive individuals showed low airway
antibodies after vaccination. In the former COVID-19 patients, airway antibody
levels were significantly elevated after the boost vaccination, highlighting the 
importance of prime and boost vaccinations for previously infected individuals to
obtain optimal mucosal protection.
