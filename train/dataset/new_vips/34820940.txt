BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Few head-to-head evaluations of immune responses to
different vaccines have been reported.
METHODS: Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) antibody levels of adults
receiving either two doses of BNT162b2 (n = 366) or CoronaVac (n = 360) vaccines 
in Hong Kong were determined. An age-matched subgroup (BNT162b2 [n = 49] vs.
CoronaVac [n = 49]) was tested for plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) and
spike-binding antibody and T-cell reactivity in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells.
RESULTS: One month after the second dose of vaccine, BNT162b2 elicited
significantly higher PRNT50 , PRNT90 , sVNT, spike receptor binding, spike
N-terminal domain binding, spike S2 domain binding, spike FcR binding and
antibody avidity levels than CoronaVac. The geometric mean PRNT50 titres in those
vaccinated with BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines were 251.6 and 69.45, while
PRNT90 titres were 98.91 and 16.57, respectively. All of those vaccinated with
BNT162b2 and 45 (91.8%) of 49 vaccinated with CoronaVac achieved the 50%
protection threshold for PRNT90. Allowing for an expected seven-fold waning of
antibody titres over 6 months for those receiving CoronaVac, only 16.3% would
meet the 50% protection threshold versus 79.6% of BNT162b2 vaccinees. Age was
negatively correlated with PRNT90 antibody titres. Both vaccines induced
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses at 1 month post-vaccination
but CoronaVac elicited significantly higher structural protein-specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ T-cell responses.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination with BNT162b2 induces stronger humoral responses than
CoronaVac. CoronaVac induces higher CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the
structural protein than BNT162b2.
