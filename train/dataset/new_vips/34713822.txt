BACKGROUND: Worldwide despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy, human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome still causes morbidity 
and mortality among patients. In Sub-Saharan Africa, human immunodeficiency
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome remains a major public health concern.
The aim of this study was to identify the causes of morbidity and mortality in
the modern antiretroviral therapy era in Sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We searched relevant
studies from 3 databases which are Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Two review
authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles in
duplicate, extracted data, and assessed bias. Discrepancies were resolved by
discussion or arbitration of a third review author. R software version 3.6.2 was 
used to analyze the data. Maximum values were used in order to show which disease
was mostly spread out by looking at the highest prevalence reported. This
systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).
RESULTS: A total of 409 articles were obtained from the database search, finally 
12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for data extraction.
Among them, 3 were conducted in Nigeria, 2 were conducted in Uganda, 3 were
conducted in South Africa, 1 in Gabon, 1 in Ethiopia, 1 in Ghana, and 1 in
Burkina Faso. In most of the included studies, tuberculosis was the leading cause
of hospitalization which accounted for between 18% and 40.7% and it was also the 
leading cause of death and accounted for between 16% and 44.3%, except in 1 which
reported anemia as the leading cause of hospitalization and in 2 which reported
wasting syndrome and meningitis respectively as the leading causes of death.
Opportunistic malignancies accounted between for 1.8% to 5% of hospitalization
and 1.2% to 9.8% of deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is the commonest cause of hospitalization and death in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, but it is always followed by other infectious disease and
other non-AIDS related causes.
