OBJECTIVE: To understand the challenges faced by urban midwives in assisting
planned home births during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Qualitative study, based on the Collective Subject Discourse
methodological framework, carried out with eight professionals, members of a
birth care collective from the northeast region of Brazil. Data was collected
between September and October of 2020 using the focus group technique.
RESULTS: The collective discourses revealed five central ideas: Changing
assistance strategy; Dealing with frustration; Facing the fear of contamination; 
Avoiding exposure to the virus; and Keeping distance during the care process.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The challenging condition the pandemic brings to the care
of planned home births is made evident, being marked by the need for collective
protection and the pressure of following health recommendations. The study also
points out the need for official protocols and good quality information based on 
scientific evidence and humanizing principles to guide health care.
