Brazil presents one of the highest COVID-19 death tolls in the world. The initial
SARS-CoV-2 epicenter was São Paulo city. As of 2019, the homeless population of
São Paulo city was estimated at 24,344 individuals, the largest national homeless
population. The present study aimed to concomitantly assess the molecular and
serological prevalence and associated risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a
homeless population and related shelter workers from a day-shelter. Serum
samples, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs of persons who are homeless and
shelter workers collected from August 25th to 27th, 2020 were tested for the
presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA by
RT-qPCR, respectively. All swab samples tested negative by RT-qPCR.
Seropositivity of IgM and IgG was 5/203 (2.5%) and 111/203 (54.7%) in persons who
are homeless, and 5/87 (5.7%) and 41/87 (47.1%) in shelter workers, respectively,
with no statistical differences between groups. The high seroprevalence found
herein indicates early environmental and urban spreading of SARS-CoV-2,
associated with sociodemographic and economic vulnerability.
