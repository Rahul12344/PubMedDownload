BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection contributes to cancers in a
fraction of seropositive individuals, but much remains to be learned about
variation in EBV-directed humoral immunity in cancer-free adults.
METHODS: A protein microarray was used to probe serum from 175 Taiwanese and 141 
Northern European adults for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses to 115
different peptide sequences, representing protein segments or protein variants,
from 45 EBV proteins. It was posited that this antibody-based approach could
identify EBV peptide sequences representing immunodominant regions relevant for
B-cell immunity.
RESULTS: Analyses of 45 EBV proteins with multiple protein segments or variants
printed on the array identified eight EBV peptide sequences that appear to play a
role in immunogenicity. This included: (1) three proteins with segments/regions
associated with IgG reactivity (BALF5, LMP1, LMP2A); and (2) five proteins with
sequence variants/amino acid changes associated with IgG reactivity (BDLF4,
EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA-LP, LF1).
CONCLUSION: This examination of IgG antibody responses against 115 EBV peptide
sequences in 316 cancer-free adults represents an important step toward
identifying specific EBV protein sequences that play a role in generating B-cell 
immunity in humans.
