A new compound classified as one new azaphilone derivative, nigirpexin E (1), was
obtained from the soil-derived fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum LTR-2, together
with seven known compounds (2-8). The structures of 1-8 were determined by their 
HRESIMS, optical rotation, and NMR spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration
of nigirpexin E (1) was determined on the basis of comparisons of experimental
and theoretically calculated ECD spectra. Compound 3 was firstly isolated from
Trichoderma. Bioactivities of the isolated compounds were assayed their
anti-tobacco mosaic virus (anti-TMV) activities. The results showed that compound
1 exhibited significant inactivation effect against TMV with an inhibition rate
of 67.25% (0.5 mg ml-1), which was higher than that of positive control ribavirin
(56.74%). This is the first report of the anti-TMV activity of azaphilone
derivatives.
