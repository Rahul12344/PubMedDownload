The persistence of anti-viral immunity is essential for protection and exhibits
profound heterogeneity across individuals. Here, we elucidate the factors that
shape maintenance and function of anti-viral T cell immunity in the body by
comprehensive profiling of virus-specific T cells across blood, lymphoid organs, 
and mucosal tissues of organ donors. We use flow cytometry, T cell receptor
sequencing, single-cell transcriptomics, and cytokine analysis to profile
virus-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing the ubiquitous pathogens influenza and
cytomegalovirus. Our results reveal that virus specificity determines overall
magnitude, tissue distribution, differentiation, and clonal repertoire of
virus-specific T cells. Age and sex influence T cell differentiation and
dissemination in tissues, while T cell tissue residence and functionality are
highly correlated with the site. Together, our results demonstrate how the
covariates of virus, tissue, age, and sex impact the anti-viral immune response, 
which is important for targeting, monitoring, and predicting immune responses to 
existing and emerging viruses.
