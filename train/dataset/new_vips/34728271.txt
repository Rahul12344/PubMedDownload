In an era of decreasing genetic diversity of Measles Virus (MeV), effective
surveillance requires a higher-resolution genotyping method or whole genome
sequencing (WGS) to document elimination. Through optimization of MeV WGS
protocol, we developed a MeV-specific probe enrichment method that allows next
generation sequencing from clinical specimens. With the probe enrichment method, 
70% of specimens can be sequenced at a read depth of greater than 10 reads with
minimal off-target sequences.
