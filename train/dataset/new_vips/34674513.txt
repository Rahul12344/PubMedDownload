Chronic Hepatitis B is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and is currently 
incurable. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA is a key
form of the virus responsible for its persistence and is the transcriptional
template for all viral transcripts. The field is focussed on methods to clear HBV
cccDNA but this been limited by technical difficulties in its quantification due 
to: identical sequence to other forms of HBV DNA; low copy number per cell; and
high resistance to denaturation by heat, leading to difficulty using PCR or
hybridization methods for detection. A number of assays have been developed in
order to overcome these hurdles either directly or detecting cccDNA levels
indirectly via its transcriptional products. In this review, we summarize the
approaches to cccDNA quantification that are currently used, and outline key open
questions in the cccDNA biology field which remain to be answered due to the
limitations of current methods.
