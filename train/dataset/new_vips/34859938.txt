Targeting intracellular components for lysosomal degradation by autophagy not
only maintains cellular homeostasis but also counteracts the effects of external 
stimuli, including invading pathogens. Among various kinds of pathogens, viruses 
have been extensively shown to induce autophagy to benefit viral growth in
infected cells and to modulate host defense responses, such as innate antiviral
immunity. Recently, numerous lines of evidence have implied that virus-induced
autophagy triggers multilayer mechanisms to regulate the innate antiviral
response of host cells, thus promoting a balance in virus-host cell interactions.
In this review, the detailed mechanisms underlying autophagy and the innate
antiviral immune response are first described. Then, I summarize the current
information regarding the diverse functional role(s) of autophagy in the control 
of antiviral defenses against different types of viral infections. Moreover, the 
physiological significance of autophagy-regulated antiviral responses on the
viral life cycle and the potential autophagy alterations induced by
virus-associated antiviral signaling is further discussed.
