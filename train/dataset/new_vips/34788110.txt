Evidence on the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance on
regimens following treatment failure is varied and inconclusive. Differential
medication adherence may explain this variation. We aimed to test the association
between drug resistance at first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) switch and
adherence to and virologic failure on subsequent ART. We conducted a secondary
analysis of data from an open-labeled randomized trial of second-line ART (ACTG
A5234). ART susceptibility was determined from study entry plasma using the
Stanford Drug Resistance database version 8.7. Adherence was measured with
microelectronic monitors. Three adherence variables and rates of virologic
failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL) on second-line ART were compared between
participants with and without resistance at first-line ART failure. Of 214
participants switching to second-line ART with baseline resistance results, 113
(53%) were men, mean age was 39 years (standard deviation 10.3), and 37 (17%) had
susceptible virus at study entry. Cumulative genotypic susceptibility score
(cGSS) was inversely associated with adherence, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.15,
95% confidence interval (CI) (0.05-0.40), p < 0.001. The aOR of virologic failure
for a one-unit increase in cGSS was 1.72, 95% CI (1.22-2.41), p < 0.001.
Participants switched to second-line ART without resistance displayed inferior
adherence and had higher rates of virologic failure. Therefore, these individuals
warrant additional adherence interventions to help them achieve virologic
success. Clinical Trial Registration number: NCT00608569.
