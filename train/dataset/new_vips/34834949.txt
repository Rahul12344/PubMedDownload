(1) Background: Equine arteritis virus (EAV) infection causes reproductive losses
and systemic vasculitis in susceptible equidae. The intact male becomes the
virus' reservoir upon EAV infection, as it causes a chronic-persistent infection 
of the accessory sex glands. Infected semen is the main source of virus
transmission. (2) Here, we describe acute EAV infection and spread in a stallion 
population after introduction of new members to the group. (3) Conclusions: acute
clinical signs, acute phase detection of antigen via (PCR) nasal swabs or (EDTA) 
blood, and seroconversion support the idea of transmission via seminal fluids
into the respiratory tract(s) of others. This outbreak highlights EAV's
horizontal transmission via the respiratory tract. This route should be
considered in a chronic-persistently infected herd, when seronegative animals are
added to the group.
