Improving the provision of supportive care for patients with Ebola is an
important quality improvement initiative. We designed a simulated Ebola Treatment
Unit (ETU) to assess performance and safety of healthcare workers (HCWs)
performing tasks wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in hot (35 °C, 60%
relative humidity) or thermo-neutral (20 °C, 20% relative humidity) conditions.
In this pilot phase to determine the feasibility of study procedures, HCWs in PPE
were non-randomly allocated to hot or thermo-neutral conditions to perform
peripheral intravenous (PIV) and midline catheter (MLC) insertion and
endotracheal intubation (ETI) on mannequins. Eighteen HCWs (13 physicians, 4
nurses, 1 nurse practitioner; 2 with prior ETU experience; 10 in hot conditions) 
spent 69 (10) (mean (SD)) minutes in the simulated ETU. Mean (SD) task completion
times were 16 (6) min for PIV insertion; 33 (5) min for MLC insertion; and 16 (8)
min for ETI. Satisfactory task completion was numerically higher for physicians
vs. nurses. Participants' blood pressure was similar, but heart rate was higher
(p = 0.0005) post-simulation vs. baseline. Participants had a median (range) of
2.0 (0.0-10.0) minor PPE breaches, 2.0 (0.0-6.0) near-miss incidents, and 2.0
(0.0-6.0) health symptoms and concerns. There were eight health-assessment
triggers in five participants, of whom four were in hot conditions. We terminated
the simulation of two participants in hot conditions due to thermal discomfort.
In summary, study tasks were suitable for physician participants, but they
require redesign to match nurses' expertise for the subsequent randomized phase
of the study. One-quarter of participants had a health-assessment trigger. This
research model may be useful in future training and research regarding clinical
care for patients with highly infectious pathogens in austere settings.
