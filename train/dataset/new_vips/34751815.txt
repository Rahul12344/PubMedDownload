Recently, it was reported that the forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor
promotes human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication via direct binding to the
promoters of the major immediate-early (MIE) genes, but how the FoxO factor
impacts HCMV replication remains unknown. Here, it is reported that FoxO1
expression is strongly induced by HCMV infection in cells of fibroblast origin.
Suppression of the FoxO1 gene by specific RNA interference significantly
inhibited HCMV growth and replication, but viral DNA synthesis was not affected
considerably. Interestingly, depletion or overexpression of FoxO1 had a
significant effect on the expression of viral early/late transcripts. FoxO1 was
found to colocalize with the pUL44 protein subunit of viral replication
compartments without direct association with DNA. This study highlights how FoxO 
enhances HCMV gene transcription and viral replication to promote infection.
