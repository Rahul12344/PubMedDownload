COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, has challenged the health care systems of the
world. Although the pulmonary complications of the infection have received
extensive attention, addressing the other complications (e.g., changes in
androgen levels) could further provide a more efficient understanding of the
disease, which might aid in combating it. Since the association between androgens
and the expression and activity of SARS-CoV-2 receptors has been proven and
anti-androgen-based therapies have been considered in this regard, addressing
various aspects of androgen level changes can be constructive. The present paper 
examines the possible mechanisms of changes in androgen levels by the virus. It
seems that the infection of the gonads by the SARS-CoV-2 could reduce the
androgen levels by affecting different cellular pathways.
