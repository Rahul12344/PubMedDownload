PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Management of Epstein-Barr virus posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV PTLD) is complex, involving risk
stratification, prevention and/or preemptive measures involving monitoring EBV
DNAemia and balancing treatment options, using a combination of reduction of
immune suppression, anti-B cell therapy, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).
RECENT FINDINGS: The highest risk factor for the development of EBV PTLD in
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains T cell depletion, with increasing use
of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab in conditioning. In solid organ
transplantation (SOT), the incidence of PTLD is highest among EBV seronegative
recipients who are at risk for primary EBV infection following transplant in the 
first 12 months. Prevention is a critical component of the management of EBV
PTLD. Although preemptive therapy remains standard of care, there continues to be
heterogenicity and debate over the optimal choice of EBV DNA quantification and
the threshold to use. Novel therapies such as donor-derived multipathogen and EBV
specific CTLs for the prevention and third party CTLs for the treatment of EBV
PTLD are promising, with rapidly expanding evidence, including large scale Phase 
III trials currently underway.
SUMMARY: With an increasing number of risk groups for developing EBV PTLD in HCT 
and SOT, management strategies using prophylaxis or preemptive therapy remain
standard of care, however the use of prophylactic or preemptive EBV specific or
multipathogen CTLs show promising results and safety profiles.
