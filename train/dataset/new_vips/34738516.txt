IntroductionThe detection of SARS-CoV-2 with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) has
become an important tool to identify infected people and break infection chains. 
These RDT are usually based on antigen detection in a lateral flow approach.AimWe
aimed to establish a comprehensive specimen panel for the decentralised technical
evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests.MethodsWhile for PCR
diagnostics the validation of a PCR assay is well established, there is no common
validation strategy for antigen tests, including RDT. In this proof-of-principle 
study we present the establishment of a panel of 50 pooled clinical specimens
that cover a SARS-CoV-2 concentration range from 1.1 × 109 to 420 genome copies
per mL of specimen. The panel was used to evaluate 31 RDT in up to six
laboratories.ResultsOur results show that there is considerable variation in the 
detection limits and the clinical sensitivity of different RDT. We show that the 
best RDT can be applied to reliably identify infectious individuals who present
with SARS-CoV-2 loads down to 106 genome copies per mL of specimen. For the
identification of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 loads corresponding to
less than 106 genome copies per mL, only three RDT showed a clinical
sensitivity of more than 60%.ConclusionsSensitive RDT can be applied to identify 
infectious individuals with high viral loads but not to identify all infected
individuals.
