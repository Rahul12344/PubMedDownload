Macrophages comprise a heterogeneous immune cell population and display
niche-specific phenotypes and functions in almost all organs. Testicular
macrophages (TMs) perform essential immune and non-immune functions in the
mammalian male gonads. Here, we discuss the most recent findings on TM ontogeny, 
heterogeneity, and function under steady state and inflammatory conditions. We
also highlight new discoveries regarding the functions of macrophages during
bacterial and viral infections of the testes and how macrophages may indirectly
help the establishment of a reservoir through virus seeding. Understanding TM
function and macrophage-related mechanisms of disease might assist in developing 
new opportunities for intervention in male infertility.
