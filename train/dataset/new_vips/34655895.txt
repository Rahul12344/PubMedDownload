Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reports of new variants that
potentially increase virulence and viral transmission, as well as reduce the
efficacy of available vaccines, have recently emerged. In this study, we
computationally analyzed the N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants for their ability 
to bind Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used the protein-protein
docking approach to explore whether the three variants displayed a higher binding
affinity to the ACE2 receptor than the wild type. We found that these variants
alter the hydrogen bonding network and the cluster of interactions. Additional
salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and a high number of non-bonded contacts (i.e.,
non-bonded interactions between atoms in the same molecule and those in other
molecules) were observed only in the mutant complexes, allowing efficient binding
to the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, we used a 2.0-μs all-atoms simulation approach
to detect differences in the structural dynamic features of the resulting protein
complexes. Our findings revealed that the mutant complexes possessed stable
dynamics, consistent with the global trend of mutations yielding variants with
improved stability and enhanced affinity. Binding energy calculations based on
molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) further revealed that
electrostatic interactions principally increased net binding energies. The
stability and binding energies of N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants were enhanced
compared to the wild-type-ACE2 complex. The net binding energy of the systems was
-31.86 kcal/mol for the wild-type-ACE2 complex, -67.85 kcal/mol for N439K,
-69.82 kcal/mol for S477 N, and -69.64 kcal/mol for T478K. The current study
provides a basis for exploring the enhanced binding abilities and structural
features of SARS-CoV-2 variants to design novel therapeutics against the virus.
