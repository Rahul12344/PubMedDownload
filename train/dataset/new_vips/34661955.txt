BACKGROUD: Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in children under
5 years old. Viruses have historically been the most common cause of
community-acquired pneumonia in children. Co-infections in severe pneumonia are
more concern by clinicians.
METHOD: It was a perspective and descriptive study. Real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) is a modern test that was used to detect many new pathogens,
including microbiological co-infections. RT-PCR technique was used in this study 
to investigate the causes of severe pneumonia.
RESULTS: Through the analysis of nasopharyngeal aspiration samples from 95
children with severe community-acquired pneumonia, the positive RT-PCR rate was
90.5%. Viral-bacterial co-infection accounted for the highest proportion (43.1%),
followed by bacterial co-infection (33.7%), viral infection (7.4%), bacterial
infection (6.3%) and the remaining 9.5% was unknown. In the co-infections groups,
the five main bacteria species detected by PCR were Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Haemophilus influenzae, MRSA, Moraxella catarrhalis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
CONCLUSION: Antibiotic treatment should focus on detected microbes in cases of
severe pneumonia for having a good result.
