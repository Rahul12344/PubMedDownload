BACKGROUND: Rapid antigen detection assays are promising tools for the diagnosis 
of COVID-19. We assess the performances of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test.
METHODS: The Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid test was compared to a reference RT-PCR
performed on the same nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). Overall, 81 NPS were tested
retrospectively and 330 healthcare workers (HCWs) were tested prospectively.
RESULTS: Retrospective analyze. Of the 48 SARS-CoV-2 positive NPS, 19 (39.6%)
were found positive with the Panbio COVID-19. There was no cross-reactivity with 
SARS-CoV-2 negative NPS. The Kappa value was 0.459. Prospective analyze. The
prevalence of COVID-19 was 26.1% in symptomatic HCWs. The overall sensitivity and
specificity of the Panbio COVID-19 were 47.2% and 100.0% respectively. The
sensitivity was 55.2% and 14.3% in those tested within and after 4 days of
diseases respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid test displays low performance for the
identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
