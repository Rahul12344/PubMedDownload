Introduction: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Vaccination is one aspect of public health policy aimed
at eliminating HBV infection. After the implementation of an HBV vaccination
program for newborns in Thailand, the estimated residual infection rate was 3.5%.
However, that study was conducted in only 5,964 participants in seven provinces
and only 22 years after the start of the campaign. This study aimed to evaluate
the HBV seroprevalence rate in Thailand in larger sample size and a longer
duration after program implementation using HBV surveillance.
Methods: This was a surveillance study conducted in 20 provinces in northeast
Thailand. The study period was between July 2010 and November 2019. Rates of HBV 
seroprevalence in each province and overall were calculated. Participants were
divided into two groups: those vaccinated under the national campaign and those
who were not. Participants aged 0-20 years were used as references, while other
age groups (intervals of 10 years) were comparators. Residual HBV seroprevalence 
after the vaccination program was calculated with odds ratio for HBV
seroprevalence in each age group.
Results: There were 31,855 subjects who participated in the project. Of those,
1,805 (5.7%) had HBV. The HBV seroprevalence rate in the national HBV vaccination
group was significantly lower than that in those not vaccinated under the
national program (1.0% vs 5.9%; p<0.001). Seroprevalence was 1.0% in participants
≤20 years of age. Participants 31-40 years of age had the highest odds ratio
(10.41), followed those 21-30 years of age (7.42).
Conclusions: This real-world surveillance study showed that residual HBV
infection was 1.0% after nearly 30 years of nationwide HBV vaccination.
