Objectives: Baseline presence of nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A)
resistance-associated variants can attenuate the efficacy of new direct-acting
antivirals. A potential method to attain the higher efficacy would be to screen
for NS5A polymorphisms prior to the initiation of therapy and to adjust the
treatment length based on the test results. However, baseline testing adds
additional costs and it is unclear whether this would represent a high value
strategy for chronic hepatitis C in China. Methods: A hybrid model compared 1)
standard 12-weeks treatment (no testing), 2) shortened 8-weeks treatment (no
testing), and 3) baseline testing with 12-/8-weeks treatment for those
with/without NS5A polymorphisms from a lifetime Chinese health care payer
perspective. All model inputs were retrieved from clinical trials and publically 
available literature. And sensitivity analyses were also conducted to assess the 
impact of uncertainty. Results: Baseline testing was associated with overall
increase in total health care cost of USD 13.50 and in QALYs of 0.002 compared
with standard 12-weeks treatment (no testing), yielded in an ICER of USD
6750/QALY gained. Scenario analyses suggested that shortened 8-weeks treatment
(no testing) was found to be lower costs and great QALYs compared with other two 
strategies when the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate increased to 95%.
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust. Conclusions: Our
results suggest prior assessment of NS5A sensitivity followed by optimizing
treatment duration was an economic strategy. In addition, shortened 8-weeks
treatment (no testing) was shown to be dominant with the SVR rate increased to
95%.
