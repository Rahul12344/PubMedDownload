The South Island robin (Petroica australis) is a small passerine bird endemic to 
New Zealand (Aotearoa). Although its population has declined recently and it is
considered 'at risk,' little research has been done to identify viruses in this
species. This study aimed to survey the diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses 
associated with South Island robins in a small, isolated population on Nukuwaiata
Island. In total, 108 DNA viruses were identified from pooled fecal samples
collected from 38 individual robins sampled. These viruses belong to the
Circoviridae (n = 10), Genomoviridae (n = 12), and Microviridae (n = 73)
families. A number of genomes that belong to the phylum Cressdnaviricota but are 
otherwise unclassified (n = 13) were also identified. These results greatly
expand the known viral diversity associated with South Island robins, and we
identify a novel group of viruses most closely related genomoviruses.
