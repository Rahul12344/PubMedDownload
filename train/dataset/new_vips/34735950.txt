BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a worldwide pandemic - although none of
its predecessors from the coronavirus family ever achieved such a scale. The key 
to understanding the global success of SARS-CoV-2 is hidden in its genome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved data for 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records uploaded 
to the GISAID database from the beginning of the pandemic until the January 8,
2021. A Python variant detection script was developed to process the data using
pairwise2 from the BioPython library. Sequence alignments were performed for
every gene separately (except ORF1ab, which was not studied). Genomes less than
26,000 nucleotides long were excluded from the research. Clustering was performed
using HDBScan.
RESULTS: Here, we addressed the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 using 329,942
samples. The analysis yielded 155 SNPs and deletions in more than 0.3% of the
sequences. Clustering results suggested that a proportion of people (2.46%) was
infected with a distinct subtype of the B.1.1.7 variant, which contained four to 
six additional mutations (G28881A, G28882A, G28883С, A23403G, A28095T, G25437T). 
Two clusters were formed by mutations in the samples uploaded predominantly by
Denmark and Australia (1.48% and 2.51%, respectively). A correlation coefficient 
matrix detected 160 pairs of mutations (correlation coefficient greater than
0.7). We also addressed the completeness of the GISAID database, patient gender, 
and age. Finally, we found ORF6 and E to be the most conserved genes (96.15% and 
94.66% of the sequences totally match the reference, respectively). Our results
indicate multiple areas for further research in both SARS-CoV-2 studies and
health science.
