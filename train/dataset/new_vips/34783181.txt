Liver biopsies are recommended to exclude significant liver inflammation in
patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with elevated HBV DNA but without other
indications for antiviral treatment. We aimed to investigate the proportions and 
determinants of significant inflammation in Asian patients with CHB with
detectable HBV DNA. We conducted a cross-sectional study that retrospectively
included 581 patients with CHB with detectable HBV DNA who had undergone liver
biopsy. Liver inflammation and fibrosis were staged by Scheuer's classification. 
Significant inflammation and significant fibrosis were defined as G ≥ 2 and
S ≥ 2, respectively. There were 179 (30.8%) patients with alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) < 1 × upper limit of normal (ULN), 205 (35.3%) patients
with ALT 1-2 × ULN, and 197 (33.9%) patients with ALT > 2 × ULN. A total of 397
(68.3%) patients had significant inflammation, and 340 (58.5%) patients had
significant fibrosis. Significant inflammation was found in 85% of patients with 
significant fibrosis and in 44.8% of patients without significant fibrosis.
Furthermore, 28.7% of patients with CHB with detectable HBV DNA and normal ALT in
the absence of significant fibrosis had significant inflammation. Moderate HBV
DNA (5-7 log10 IU/mL) was a risk factor for significant inflammation (odds ratio 
[OR] 6.929, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.830-16.966, P < 0.001) in patients
with CHB with detectable HBV DNA, especially for patients with detectable HBV DNA
and normal ALT in the absence of significant fibrosis (adjusted OR 13.161, 95% CI
1.026-168.889, P = 0.048). Conclusion: A high proportion of CHB patients with
detectable HBV DNA and normal ALT in the absence of significant fibrosis have
significant liver inflammation. Liver biopsies are recommended to evaluate liver 
inflammation in such patients, especially for those with moderate HBV DNA.
