TGA transcription factors (TFs) exhibit basal resistance in Arabidopsis, but
susceptibility to a pathogen attack in tomatoes; however, their roles in soybean 
(Glycine max) to Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) are unknown. In this study, 27 TGA
genes were isolated from a SMV hyper-susceptible soybean NN1138-2, designated
GmTGA1~GmTGA27, which were clustered into seven phylogenetic groups. The
expression profiles of GmTGAs showed that the highly expressed genes were mainly 
in Groups I, II, and VII under non-induction conditions, while out of the 27
GmTGAs, 19 responded to SMV-induction. Interestingly, in further transient N.
benthamiana-SMV pathosystem assay, all the 19 GmTGAs overexpressed did not
promote SMV infection in inoculated leaves, but they exhibited basal resistance
except one without function. Among the 18 functional ones, GmTGA8 and GmTGA19,
with similar motif distribution, nuclear localization sequence and interaction
proteins, showed a rapid response to SMV infection and performed better than the 
others in inhibiting SMV multiplication. This finding suggested that GmTGA TFs
may support basal resistance to SMV even from a hyper-susceptible source. What
the mechanism of the genes (GmTGA8, GmTGA19, etc.) with basal resistance to SMV
is and what their potential for the future improvement of resistance to SMV in
soybeans is, are to be explored.
