INTRODUCTION: Melanoma brain metastases remain a devastating disease process with
poor prognosis. Recently, there has been a surge in studies demonstrating the
efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy for brain tumor treatment. Given their
specificity and amenability to genetic modification, the authors explore the
possible role of oncolytic virotherapy as a potential treatment option for
patients with melanoma brain metastases.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review including both preclinical and
clinical evidence of oncolytic virotherapy for the treatment of melanoma brain
metastasis was performed.
RESULTS: Oncolytic virotherapy, specifically T-VEC (Imlygic™), was approved for
the treatment of melanoma in 2015. Recent clinical trials demonstrate promising
anti-tumor changes in patients who have received T-VEC; however, there is little 
evidence for its use in metastatic brain disease based on the existing
literature. To date, only two single cases utilizing virotherapy in patients with
metastatic brain melanoma have been reported, specifically in patients with
treatment refractory disease. Currently, there is not sufficient data to support 
the use of T-VEC or other viruses for intracranial metastatic melanoma. In
developing a virotherapy treatment paradigm for melanoma brain metastases,
several factors must be considered, including route of administration, need to
bypass the blood-brain barrier, viral tumor infectivity, and risk of adverse
events.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for oncolytic virotherapy treatment of melanoma is limited 
primarily to T-VEC, with a noticeable paucity of data in the literature with
respect to brain tumor metastasis. Given the promising findings of virotherapy
for other brain tumor types, oncolytic virotherapy has great potential to offer
benefits to patients afflicted with melanoma brain metastases and warrants
further investigation.
