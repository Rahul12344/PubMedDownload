This research studies the development of distribution networks for the last mile 
distribution for cross-border E-business based on a vision of fourth party
logistics (4PL) in smart cities in emerging markets in response to COVID-19. This
research analyzes the distribution centers of distribution companies in Beijing
city using fuzzy cluster analysis as a case study of smart cities. The location
decision for distribution centers to serve cross-border E-business is further
analyzed by considering the local conditions of the distribution centers. The
solutions to the location decisions for distribution centers in different cases
are further visualized by 2-mode networks. The key nodes in the distribution
network of the last mile for cross-border E-business are further studied based on
fourth-party logistics by a immune algorithm. Cross-border E-business value
creation based on the development of distribution networks using fourth-party
logistics is further discussed. The location distribution of key nodes can spread
from the downtown district to suburban areas as the coverage of the distribution 
network is expanded. This research can help managers and decision makers address 
the last mile distribution for cross-border E-business in smart cities in
emerging markets based on a vision of fourth-party logistics in response to
COVID-19.
