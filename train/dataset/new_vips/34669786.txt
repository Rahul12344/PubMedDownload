OBJECTIVE: to assess the quality of life of nurse practitioners during the
COVID-19 pandemic and analyze related factors.
METHODS: cross-sectional and analytical study carried out with nurse
practitioners. A questionnaire on sociodemographic characterization, work
activities and changes perceived with the pandemic and WHOQOL-bref were used. To 
compare the groups of interest, analysis of covariance was used.
RESULTS: 572 professionals participated, who had a mean total quality of life
score of 56.79 (SD=13.56). In the relationship of variables with WHOQOL-bref,
having two or more jobs and being a nurse were associated with better quality of 
life, but being a woman and working more than 50 hours a week was associated with
a worse perception of the construct.
CONCLUSIONS: the factors analyzed indicate a lower perception of quality of life 
associated with the social domain, requiring interventions that reduce the damage
to professionals' health and contribute to quality of care provided.
