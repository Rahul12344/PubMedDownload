Introduction: Condyloma acuminata (CA) is one of the sexually transmitted
infections caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Condyloma acuminata patients are
usually coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly those
with low CD4+ levels. Chemical cautery and cryosurgery are therapeutic modalities
for CA, aiming to remove lesions and prevent recurrence, especially in patients
with HIV.
Objective: To compare the efficacy of chemical cautery to cryosurgery on CD4+
status of HIV patients with CA.
Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted in patients with CA 
visiting the Dermatology and Venereology outpatient clinic and the voluntary
counseling and testing (VCT) clinic of Dr. Moewardi Hospital Surakarta, Indonesia
from January 2018 to December 2020. The data were taken from the medical records 
of patients. These subjects were grouped into CA with HIV and without HIV. The
data were statistically analyzed with t-tests followed by multivariate regression
tests, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Results: Seventy-eight patients with CA were included in the study, comprising 41
subjects with HIV infection and 37 subjects without HIV infection. The subjects
were predominantly male (68%). Of all the subjects, 70.5% received chemical
cautery, and the remaining had cryosurgery. Multivariate regression tests
obtained no significant differences in CD4+ levels between chemical cautery and
cryosurgery (p=0.138 vs p=0.907).
Conclusion: Either chemical cautery or cryosurgery is effective in improving the 
clinical condition of patients with CA. Although chemical cautery results in a
higher level of CD4+ than cryosurgery, statistically both therapies have no
significant difference regarding CD4+ status.
