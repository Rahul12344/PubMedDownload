BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has globally affected healthcare including the
transplantation programmes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the impact of COVID-19 on live 
liver donor (LLD) programme at liver transplant centre in Gambat, Pakistan.
Standard operative procedures (SOPs) including COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab PCR, 
CT scans, personal protective equipment use, 6-feet distancing were developed for
LLD and transplant team to mitigate COVID-19 exposure. We compared the
complications, healthcare utilisation (hospital stay, readmission) and mortality 
between two LLD cohorts-before and during COVID-19 pandemic from March 2019 to
December 2020.
RESULTS: During study period 300 LLD surgeries were performed. There was an
increase in rate of LLDs from 132 (44%) in pre-COVID to 168 (56%) during COVID-19
era. Average numbers of transplants per month performed during pre-COVID and
during COVID-19 era were 10.1 and 14, respectively. No donor has developed
COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Rate of all LLD complications (32
(21.47%) and 49 (29.16%), p=0.43), uneventful discharges (120/168 (71.4%) and
88/132 (66.6%), p<0.05), mean hospital stay (6±2 days and 5±2 days, p=0.17) and
readmission (5 (4%) and 3 (1.8%), p=0.43) were similar during the pre-COVID and
COVID-19 era. No donor mortality was observed during study period.
CONCLUSION: With the implementation of mindful SOPs, rate of LLD increased
without any case of COVID-19 infection. Our SOPs were helpful in continuation of 
LLD programme in a developing country during COVID-19 pandemic.
