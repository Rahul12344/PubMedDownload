BACKGROUND: Emerging cross-sectional data indicate that healthcare workers (HCWs)
in the COVID-19 era face particular mental health risks. Moral injury - a
betrayal of one's values and beliefs, is a potential concern for HCWs who witness
the devastating impact of acute COVID-19 illness while too often feeling helpless
to respond. This study longitudinally examined rates of depression, generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and moral injury
among United States HCWs in the COVID-19 era. We anticipated finding high levels 
of clinical symptoms and moral injury that would remain stable over time. We also
expected to find positive correlations between clinical symptoms and moral
injury.
METHODS: This three-wave study assessed clinical symptoms and moral injury among 
350 HCWs at baseline, 30, and 90 days between September and December 2020.
Anxiety, depression, PTSD, and moral injury were measured using the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Primary Care 
PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD), and Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES).
RESULTS: Of the 350 HCWs, 72% reported probable anxiety, depression, and/or PTSD 
disorders at baseline, 62% at day 30, and 64% at day 90. High level of moral
injury was associated with a range of psychopathology including suicidal
ideation, especially among healthcare workers self-reporting COVID-19 exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate broad, persisting, and diverse mental health
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among United States HCWs. This study is the
first to longitudinally examine the relationships between moral injury and
psychopathology among HCWs, emphasizing the need to increase HCWs' access to
mental healthcare.
