The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is fast moving and has caused a worldwide public 
health crisis. In the present article, we analyzed spike protein sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess the impact of mutational diversity. We observed from
amino acid usage patterns that spike proteins are associated with a diversity of 
mutational changes and most important underlying cause of variation of amino acid
usage is the changes in hydrophobicity of spike proteins. The changing patterns
of hydrophobicity of spike proteins over time and its influence on the receptor
binding affinity provides crucial information on the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with 
human receptor. Our results also show that spike proteins have evolved to prefer 
more hydrophobic residues over time. The present study provides a comprehensive
analysis of molecular sequence data to consider that mutational variants might
play a crucial role in modulating the virulence and spread of the virus and has
immediate implications for therapeutic strategies.
