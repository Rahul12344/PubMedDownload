BACKGROUND: Wildtype mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and P.3, contain mutations 
in spike that has been suggested to associate with an increased recognition of
mouse ACE2, raising the postulation that these SARS-CoV-2 variants may have
evolved to expand species tropism to wildtype mouse and potentially other
murines. Our study evaluated this possibility with substantial public health
importance.
METHODS: We investigated the capacity of wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 
variants in infecting mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) under in
vitro and in vivo settings. Susceptibility to infection was evaluated with
RT-qPCR, plaque assays, immunohistological stainings, and neutralization assays.
FINDINGS: Our results reveal that B.1.1.7 and other N501Y-carrying variants but
not WT SARS-CoV-2 can infect wildtype mice. High viral genome copies and high
infectious virus particle titres are recovered from the nasal turbinate and lung 
of B.1.1.7-inocluated mice for 4-to-7 days post infection. In agreement with
these observations, robust expression of viral nucleocapsid protein and
histopathological changes are detected from the nasal turbinate and lung of
B.1.1.7-inocluated mice but not that of the WT SARS-CoV-2-inoculated mice.
Similarly, B.1.1.7 readily infects wildtype rats with production of infectious
virus particles.
INTERPRETATION: Our study provides direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 variant,
B.1.1.7, as well as other N501Y-carrying variants including B.1.351 and P.3, has 
gained the capability to expand species tropism to murines and public health
measures including stringent murine control should be implemented to facilitate
the control of the ongoing pandemic.
