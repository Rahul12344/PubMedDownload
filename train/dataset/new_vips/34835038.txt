Dengue viruses (DENVs) cause the greatest public health burden globally among the
arthropod-borne viruses. DENV transmission risk has also expanded from tropical
to subtropical regions due to the increasing range of its principal mosquito
vector, Aedes aegypti. Focal outbreaks of dengue fever (dengue) in the state of
Florida (FL) in the USA have increased since 2009. However, little is known about
the competence of Ae. aegypti populations across different regions of FL to
transmit DENVs. To understand the effects of DENV genotype and serotype
variations on vector susceptibility and transmission potential in FL, we orally
infected a colony of Ae. aegypti (Orlando/ORL) with low passage or laboratory
DENV-1 through -4. Low passage DENVs were more infectious to and had higher
transmission potential by ORL mosquitoes. We used these same DENVs to examine
natural Ae. aegypti populations to determine whether spatial distributions
correlated with differential vector competence. Vector competence across all DENV
serotypes was greater for mosquitoes from areas with the highest dengue incidence
in south FL compared to north FL. Vector competence for low passage DENVs was
significantly higher, revealing that transmission risk is influenced by
virus/vector combinations. These data support a targeted mosquito-plus-pathogen
screening approach to more accurately estimate DENV transmission risk.
