BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis placed extraordinary demands on the supply of
personal protective equipment (PPE) at the beginning of 2020. These were coupled 
with shocks to the supply chain resulting from the disease. Many typically
well-resourced health systems faced subsequent shortages of equipment and had to 
implement new strategies to manage their stocks. Stockpiles of protective
equipment were held in both the United States and United Kingdom intended to
prevent shortages.
METHOD: Cross-comparative case study approach by applying Pettigrew and Whipp's
framework for change management.
SETTING: The health systems of England and New York state from January 2020 to
the end of April 2020.
RESULTS: Both cases reacted slowly to their outbreaks and faced problems with
supplying enough PPE to their health systems. Their stockpiles were not enough to
prevent shortages, with many distribution problems resulting from inadequate
governance mechanisms. No sustainable responses to supply disruptions were
implemented during the study period in either case. Health systems planned
interventions along each part of the supply chain from production and importing, 
to usage guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Global supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions caused by
international crises, and existing mitigation strategies have not been wholly
successful. The existence of stockpiles is insufficient to preventing shortages
of necessary equipment in clinical settings. Both the governance and quality of
stockpiles, as well as distribution channels are important for preventing
shortages. At the time of writing, it is not possible to judge the strength of
strategies adopted in these cases.
