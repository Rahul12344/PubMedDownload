The laying hen has been used as a model for ovarian adenocarcinoma (OAC) in
women. Previous work has shown an association between expression of endogenous
retroviral proteins and elevated envelope mRNA and occurrence of OAC has been
demonstrated in humans, but causality has not been demonstrated. The objective of
this study was to determine whether there is a similar association between
retrovirus presence and OAC in a commercial laying hen flock at the University of
Illinois Poultry Research facility with a history of a high prevalence of OAC in 
its aged hens. Laying hens of three age strata were randomly selected for a
cross-sectional study. Blood samples were collected, and serum was tested for
antigens of endogenous or exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV) by ELISA. Birds
were humanely euthanized, and spleens, ovaries, and any tissues with gross
lesions were sampled. Ovaries and tissues with gross lesions were examined
histologically and spleens were used for RT-PCR to detect endogenous ALV via
ALV-E env mRNA expression. Overall, hens with OAC were 5.2 times more likely to
be ALV positive than hens without OAC (95% C.I. = 2.06-13.14). Holding age
stratum constant, OAC positive hens were 3.6 times more likely to be positive for
ALV via antigen-capture ELISA (95% C.I. 1.08- 11.96). Endogenous ALV-E in hens
may be analogous to the human endogenous retroviruses, which have also been
associated with OAC in women. Further studies to establish causation are
warranted to better understand the potential for laying hens to serve as a
laboratory model for viral-induced ovarian tumors in humans.
