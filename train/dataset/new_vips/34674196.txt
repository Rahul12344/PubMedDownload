Verruca vulgaris, also known as common warts, is most often seen on the skin of
hands and feet. Human papilloma virus (HPV) plays an aetiological role in the
development of this lesion. Oral verruca vulgaris (OVV) may occur on the palate, 
buccal mucosa, and tongue. Although asymptomatic and benign, HPV has been linked 
to squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity and oropharyngeal areas. Therefore,
prompt surgical removal of OVV is warranted. We report a case of a OVV in a
48-year-old male patient on palate. The lesion was a white nonscrapable lesion in
the middle of a torus palatinus. Excisional biopsy was done together with
surgical removal of torus palatinus. Histopathological analysis confirmed the
diagnosis of OVV.
