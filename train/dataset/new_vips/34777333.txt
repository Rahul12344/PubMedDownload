Objectives: The longitudinal and systematic evaluation of immunity in coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is rarely reported.
Methods: Parameters involved in innate, adaptive, and humoral immunity were
continuously monitored in COVID-19 patients from onset of illness until 45 days
after symptom onset.
Results: This study enrolled 27 mild, 47 severe, and 46 deceased COVID-19
patients. Generally, deceased patients demonstrated a gradual increase of
neutrophils and IL-6 but a decrease of lymphocytes and platelets after the onset 
of illness. Specifically, sustained low numbers of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and
dendritic cells were noted in deceased patients, while these cells gradually
restored in mild and severe patients. Furthermore, deceased patients displayed a 
rapid increase of HLA-DR expression on CD4+ T cells in the early phase, but with 
a low level of overall CD45RO and HLA-DR expressions on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,
respectively. Notably, in the early phase, deceased patients showed a lower level
of plasma cells and antigen-specific IgG, but higher expansion of CD16+CD14+
proinflammatory monocytes and HLA-DR-CD14+ monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (M-MDSCs) than mild or severe patients. Among these immunological
parameters, M-MDSCs showed the best performance in predicting COVID-19 mortality,
when using a cutoff value of ≥10%. Cluster analysis found a typical immunological
pattern in deceased patients on day 9 after onset, which was characterized as the
increase of inflammatory markers (M-MDSCs, neutrophils, CD16+CD14+ monocytes, and
IL-6) but a decrease of host immunity markers.
Conclusions: This study systemically characterizes the kinetics of immunity of
COVID-19, highlighting the importance of immunity in patient prognosis.
