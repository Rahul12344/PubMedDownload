Since 2020, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of the novel
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been constantly 
mutating, producing most of the notable missense mutations in the context of
"variants of concern", probably in response to the vaccine-driven alteration of
immune profiles of the human population. The Delta variant, in particular, has
become the most prevalent variant of the epidemic, and it is spreading in
countries with the highest vaccination rates, causing the world to face the risk 
of a new wave of the contagion. Understanding the physical mechanism responsible 
for the mutation-induced changes in the RBD's binding affinity, its
transmissibility, and its capacity to escape vaccine-induced immunity is the
"urgent challenge" in the development of preventive measures, vaccines, and
therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
In this study, entropy-enthalpy compensation and the Gibbs free energy change
were used to analyze the impact of the RBD mutations on the binding affinity of
SARS-CoV-2 variants with the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and 
existing antibodies. Through the analysis, we found that the existing mutations
have already covered almost all possible detrimental mutations that could result 
in an increase of transmissibility, and that a possible mutation in amino-acid
position 498 of the RBD can potentially enhance its binding affinity. A new
calculation method for the binding energies of protein-protein complexes is
proposed based on the entropy-enthalpy compensation rule. All known structures of
RBD-antibody complexes and the RBD-ACE2 complex comply with the entropy-enthalpy 
compensation rule in providing the driving force behind the spontaneous
protein-protein docking. The variant-induced risk of breakthrough infections in
vaccinated people is attributed to the L452R mutation's reduction of the binding 
affinity of many antibodies. Mutations reversing the hydrophobic or hydrophilic
performance of residues in the spike RBD potentially cause breakthrough
infections of coronaviruses due to the changes in geometric complementarity in
the entropy-enthalpy compensations between antibodies and the virus at the
binding sites.
