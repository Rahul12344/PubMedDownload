BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits a wide spectrum of
clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to critical conditions.
Understanding the mechanism underlying life-threatening COVID-19 is instrumental 
for disease prevention and treatment in individuals with a high risk.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the genetic cause for critical COVID-19
pneumonia in a patient with a preexisting inborn error of immunity (IEI).
METHODS: Serum levels of specific antibodies against the virus and autoantibodies
against type I interferons (IFNs) were measured. Whole exome sequencing was
performed, and the impacts of candidate gene variants were investigated. We also 
evaluated 247 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients in the Iranian IEI registry.
RESULTS: We report a 7-year-old Iranian boy with a preexisting hyper IgM syndrome
who developed critical COVID-19 pneumonia. IgM only specific COVID-19 immune
response was detected but no autoantibodies against type I IFN were observed. A
homozygous deleterious mutation in the ATM gene was identified, which together
with his antibody deficiency, radiosensitivity, and neurological signs,
established a diagnosis of A-T. Among the 247 A-T patients evaluated, 36 had
SARS-CoV-2 infection, but all had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic except the
index patient. A hemizygous deleterious mutation in the TLR7 gene was
subsequently identified in the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a unique IEI patient with combined ATM and TLR7
deficiencies. The two genetic defects underlie A-T and critical COVID-19 in this 
patient, respectively.
