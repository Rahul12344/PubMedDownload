INTRODUCTION: Stigma develops during outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic due 
to the human fear that arises from the anxiety about a disease of an unknown
etiology, with the associated detrimental consequences on both the individual and
society. This study was conducted to assess if knowledge about COVID-19,
attitude, practice and behavior regarding preventive measures against COVID-19,
fear, and anxiety towards COVID-19 will affect the level of stigma and evaluate
the mediating effect of fear, anxiety, and diagnosis of COVID-19 on stigma.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey conducted between December 20, 2020, and
January 05, 2021, enrolled 405 participants recruited from the Lebanese
population. Two scales were created and adapted to the Lebanese context to
measure the current stigma (stigma discrimination scale, self-stigma scale)
toward COVID-19.
RESULTS: More than half of the sample had moderate to severe stigma
discrimination (62%) and self-stigma (65.9%). The multivariable analysis showed
that higher fear of COVID-19 scale (Beta = .143) was significantly associated
with a higher stigma discrimination scale. Whereas, higher knowledge score
(Beta =  -.153) was significantly associated with a lower stigma discrimination
scale. Fear of COVID-19, anxiety from COVID-19, being diagnosed with COVID-19,
and having a family member with COVID-19 partially mediated the association
between knowledge and stigma discrimination scale. No mediation effect of fear
and anxiety scale was found between the knowledge and self-stigma score.
CONCLUSION: Our main findings indicate that a considerable proportion of the
Lebanese population has stigma discrimination behaviors toward COVID-19 patients 
and that those who were infected with the virus experienced COVID-19-related
stigmatization.
