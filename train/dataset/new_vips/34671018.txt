Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second common cause of cancer-related human
mortalities. Dysregulation of histone 3 (H3) methylation could lead to
transcriptional activation of multiple oncogenes, which is closely associated
with CRC tumorigenesis and progression. Nuclear receptor-binding SET Domain
protein 2 (NSD2) is a key histone methyltransferase catalyzing histone H3 lysine 
36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). Its expression, the potential functions, and
molecular mechanisms in CRC are studied here. Gene Expression Profiling
Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) bioinformatics results showed that the NSD2 mRNA
expression is elevated in both colon cancers and rectal cancers. Furthermore,
NSD2 mRNA and protein expression levels in local colon cancer tissues are
significantly higher than those in matched surrounding normal tissues. In primary
human colon cancer cells and established CRC cell lines, shRNA-induced silencing 
or CRISPR/Cas9-induced knockout of NSD2 inhibited cell viability, proliferation, 
cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, NSD2 shRNA or
knockout induced mitochondrial depolarization, DNA damage, and apoptosis in the
primary and established CRC cells. Contrarily, ectopic NSD2 overexpression in
primary colon cancer cells further enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion. H3K36me2, expressions of multiple oncogenes (ADAM9, EGFR, Sox2, Bcl-2, 
SYK, and MET) and Akt activation were significantly decreased after NSD2
silencing or knockout in primary colon cancer cells. Their levels were however
increased after ectopic NSD2 overexpression. A catalytic inactive NSD2 (Y1179A)
also inhibited H3K36me2, multiple oncogenes expression, and Akt activation, as
well as cell proliferation and migration in primary colon cancer cells. In vivo, 
intratumoral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-packed NSD2 shRNA largely 
inhibited primary colon cancer cell xenograft growth in nude mice. Together, NSD2
exerted oncogenic functions in CRC and could be a promising therapeutic target.
