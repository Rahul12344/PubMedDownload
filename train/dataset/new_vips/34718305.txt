Optimal psychic response during the COVID-19 pandemic is the result of many
different factors. One of the main factors is the psychodynamic understanding of 
essential emotions such as shame. Despite the immense effort by health workers to
address stress- and trauma-related disorders in the course of the COVID-19
pandemic, a large proportion of the people affected by the disorder do not have
information regarding the emotion of shame. Lack of mentalizing capacity implies 
disturbed shame dynamics. The therapeutic relationship and optimal alliance offer
the frame for acceptance of shame as useful for psychological growth. Empathy
should be a cure for dysfunctional shame, at the individual or social level. We
believe that including a psychodynamic approach in the national public and mental
health emergency system will empower national prevention strategies.
