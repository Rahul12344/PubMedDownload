The article is devoted to the consideration of the issues of motivation of
medical personnel to work effectively in an extreme situation of a pandemic
(COVID-19). The paper presents a sociological analysis of the working conditions 
of medical workers in the situation of the spread of a new coronavirus infection 
and the problems faced by medical workers in providing medical care in a
pandemic. A content analysis of Russian regulatory documents regulating the
requirements for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus was
carried out. A survey was conducted by the method of a semi-formalized interview 
from June 15 to June 30, 2020 among employees of medical organizations. The
authors analyzed the results of the study and concluded that medical workers
remain the main resource in the fight against a new pandemic, and, unfortunately,
one of the most vulnerable groups.
