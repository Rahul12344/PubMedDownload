INTRODUCTION: Hyposmia is among the most common symptoms of COVID-19 patients.
Previous research has mainly described this issue at the disease's early stages. 
Because olfactory impairment can indicate neurological degeneration, we
investigated the possibility of permanent olfactory damage by assessing hyposmia 
during the late recovery stage of COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: Ninety-five patients were assessed with the Brief Smell Identification
Test for Chinese (B-SITC) and Hyposmia Rating Scale (HRS) after 16 weeks from
disease onset. Five weeks later, 41 patients were retested with B-SITC.
RESULTS: At the first visit, hyposmia was identified in 26/82 (31.7%) and 22/95
(23.2%) of participants by HRS (HRS score ≤22) and B-SITC (B-SITC score <8),
respectively. The rates of hyposmia in patients who performed B-SITC after
14-15 weeks, 16-17 weeks, and ≥18 weeks from disease onset were 7/25 (28%), 8/35 
(23%) and 7/35 (20%), respectively, which demonstrated a trend of olfaction
improvement as recovery time prolonging. Hyposmia percentages decreased from the 
first visit (34.1%) to the second visit (24.4%) for the 41 patients who completed
2 visits. B-SITC scores of the first-visit hyposmia participants increased
significantly at the second visit (5.29 ± 2.02 to 8.29 ± 2.40; n = 14,
P = 0.001). Severe cases tended to recover less than common cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia was present in up to one-third of COVID-19 patients after
about 3 months from disease onset. Notable recovery of olfactory function was
observed at a next 5-weeks follow-up. Clinical severity had little influence on
olfactory impairment and recovery.
