BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to change established
structures of medical counseling services and quickly establish digital
counseling formats to ensure continuity of care. In this context, we offered
telephone and video-telephonic counseling in addition to traditional face-to-face
counseling in the office.
METHODS: Patients (n = 100) of the Cancer Counseling Center, Tübingen, were asked
to complete a questionnaire to assess the acceptance of the counseling format
following each counseling session (office, telephone, and video) in the period
between July 2020 and February 2021. The questionnaire included the subject areas
of patient characterization, assessment of therapeutic contact, therapeutic
relationship, and hurdles and was used in this exploratory care study.
RESULTS: The satisfaction and acceptance of the three counseling formats (office,
telephone, and video) were rated as "good" to "very good" in the three subgroups 
(range 1-6, office M = 1.2, telephone M = 1.3, video M = 1.4). Likewise, the
"therapeutic relationship" achieved high ratings in terms of establishment of a
therapeutic relationship in all three subgroups (office M = 5.7, telephone M =
5.0, video M = 5.0). The type of contact (office and video counseling) achieved a
significant main effect on the therapeutic relationship for items such as "I
believe that counseling is helping me" (F(2,97) = 4.80, p = 0.01) and "I feel
that I can rely on the counselor/therapist" (F(2,97) = 3.29, p = 0.04). The
"hurdles" were rated as minor and tolerable (office M = 1.3, telephone M = 1.3,
video M = 1.4). Predictor analyses showed that there was no effect of age and
gender on the acceptance of digital counseling formats in the present sample.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: On the basis of this survey, it can be concluded that 
digital counseling formats were perceived by patients as a promising addition to 
the classic face-to-face setting. In addition, it can be stated that the digital 
formats (telephone and video) were not generally preferred to face-to-face
counseling, but that the innovative telecounseling was accepted and perceived
with great satisfaction and acceptance. Accordingly, the additional use of
digital counseling formats could be an opportunity to enrich and expand the
existing presence structures also after the COVID-19 pandemic.
