Introduction: The COVID-19 is a global pandemic that is now responsible for more 
than 3 million deaths around the world. The oral and dermatological
manifestations of COVID-19 are being remarkably reported. This report aims to
describe a unique case of oral presentation of erosive lichen planus after
COVID-19 infection.
Case presentation: We present a case of oral lichen planus manifested in the
buccal mucosa and the tongue. The lesions were detected one month after COVID-19 
infection. Clinical, as well as the histopathological diagnosis, was performed on
the oral lesion to confirm oral lichen planus.
Clinical discussion: Despite viruses being reported as a triggering factor in
oral lichen planus, very few cases of oral lichen planus after COVID-19 infection
were noticed. The immunological and psychological changes induced by COVID-19
infection may explain the tendency to find lichen planus lesions in COVID-19
patients.
Conclusion: Our case suggests the possible association between COVID-19 and oral 
lichen planus. This report highlights the role of health practitioners to be
concerned about the probably rising incidence of lichen planus during the
COVID-19 pandemic and consider appropriate therapeutic and protective measures
against infection.
