Implementing a Telehealth Supportive Counseling Center With PMHNP Students.

Brown MJ, Swales SM, Sabo KK.

BACKGROUND: This educational innovation describes the implementation of a
telehealth supportive counseling center for psychiatric/mental health nurse
practitioner (PMHNP) students at a small graduate school. The free, nurse-run,
health care center was at risk due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in-person care restrictions.
METHOD: Due to COVID-19, PMHNP faculty and students pivoted to offer services via
telehealth for the summer 2020 semester. Planning and implementation strategies
regarding this pivot are presented.
RESULTS: PMHNP students conducted a total of 82 visits, recording a 150% increase
in clients served during the telehealth implementation. On average, students
accrued between 39 and 73 supervised clinical hours.
CONCLUSION: Given the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical placements as well as access to
health care services were jeopardized. Through innovation and flexibility, PMHNP 
students were able to continue accruing supervised clinical hours, and an
identified need in the community was continued to be met. [J Nurs Educ.
