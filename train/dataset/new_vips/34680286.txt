Cervical cancer is the fourth common cancer amongst women worldwide. Infection by
high-risk human papilloma virus is necessary in most cases, but not sufficient to
develop invasive cervical cancer. Despite a predicted genetic heritability in the
range of other gynaecological cancers, only few genomic susceptibility loci have 
been identified thus far. Various case-control association studies have found
corroborative evidence for several independent risk variants at the 6p21.3 locus 
(HLA), while many reports of associations with variants outside the HLA region
remain to be validated in other cohorts. Here, we review cervical cancer
susceptibility variants arising from recent genome-wide association studies and
meta-analysis in large cohorts and propose 2q14 (PAX8), 17q12 (GSDMB), and
5p15.33 (CLPTM1L) as consistently replicated non-HLA cervical cancer
susceptibility loci. We further discuss the available evidence for these loci,
knowledge gaps, future perspectives, and the potential impact of these findings
on precision medicine strategies to combat cervical cancer.
