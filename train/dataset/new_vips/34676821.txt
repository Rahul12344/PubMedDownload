BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, public perceptions and behaviours have
had to adapt rapidly to new risk scenarios and radical behavioural
restrictions.AimTo identify major drivers of acceptance of protective behaviours 
during the 4-week transition from virtually no COVID-19 cases to the nationwide
lockdown in Germany (3-25 March 2020).MethodsA serial cross-sectional online
survey was administered weekly to ca 1,000 unique individuals for four data
collection rounds in March 2020 using non-probability quota samples,
representative of the German adult population between 18 and 74 years in terms of
age × sex and federal state (n = 3,910). Acceptance of restrictions was regressed
on sociodemographic variables, time and psychological variables, e.g. trust, risk
perceptions, self-efficacy. Extraction of homogenous clusters was based on
knowledge and behaviour.ResultsAcceptance of restrictive policies increased with 
participants' age and employment in the healthcare sector; cognitive and
particularly affective risk perceptions were further significant predictors.
Acceptance increased over time, as trust in institutions became more relevant and
trust in media became less relevant. The cluster analysis further indicated that 
having a higher education increased the gap between knowledge and behaviour.
Trust in institutions was related to conversion of knowledge into
action.ConclusionIdentifying relevant principles that increase acceptance will
remain crucial to the development of strategies that help adjust behaviour to
control the pandemic, possibly for years to come. Based on our findings, we
provide operational recommendations for health authorities regarding data
collection, health communication and outreach.
