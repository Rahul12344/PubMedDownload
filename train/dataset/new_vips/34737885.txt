The purpose of this review is to highlight recent scientific developments and
provide an overview of virus self-assembly and viral particle dynamics. Viruses
are organized supramolecular structures with distinct yet related features and
functions. Plant viruses are extensively used in biotechnology, and virus-like
particulate matter is generated by genetic modification. Both provide a
material-based means for selective distribution and delivery of drug molecules.
Through surface engineering of their capsids, virus-derived nanomaterials
facilitate various potential applications for selective drug delivery. Viruses
have significant implications in chemotherapy, gene transfer, vaccine production,
immunotherapy and molecular imaging.
