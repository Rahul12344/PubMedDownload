COVID-19 as a global pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the entire
world. Projecting the future spread of the virus in relation to its
characteristics for a specific suite of countries against a temporal trend can
provide public health guidance to governments and organizations. Therefore, this 
paper presented an epidemiological comparison of the traditional SEIR model with 
an extended and modified version of the same model by splitting the infected
compartment into asymptomatic mild and symptomatic severe. We then exposed our
derived layered model into two distinct case studies with variations in
mitigation strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as a matter of 
benchmarking and comparison. We focused on exploring the United Arab Emirates (a 
small yet urban centre (where clear sequential stages NPIs were implemented).
Further, we concentrated on extending the models by utilizing the effective
reproductive number (R t) estimated against time, a more realistic than the
static R 0, to assess the potential impact of NPIs within each case study.
Compared to the traditional SEIR model, the results supported the modified model 
as being more sensitive in terms of peaks of simulated cases and flattening
determinations.
