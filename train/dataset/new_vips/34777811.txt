Alpha-fetoprotein hardly increased due to nasopharyngeal cancer. In this article,
we reported a 57-year-old male nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient who had
posttreatment subscapular metastasis with high serum alpha-fetoprotein but
negative plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Pathology results indicated that the
scapular mass was undifferentiated non-keratinizing carcinoma originated in the
nasopharynx. Moreover, no liver lesion was detected by imaging examination. In
view of the positive alpha-fetoprotein and alpha-fetoprotein messenger RNA
staining result in the right scapular mass fine needle aspiration biopsy sample, 
we considered the diagnosis of alpha-fetoprotein-producing nasopharyngeal
carcinoma that had never been reported before.
