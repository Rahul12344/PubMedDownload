Although Krüppel-associated box domain-containing zinc-finger proteins (K-ZNFs)
may be associated with sophisticated gene regulation in higher organisms, the
physiological functions of most K-ZNFs remain unknown. The Zfp212 protein was
highly conserved in mammals and abundant in the brain; it was mainly expressed in
the cerebellum (Cb). Zfp212 (mouse homolog of human ZNF212) knockout (Zfp212-KO) 
mice showed a reduction in survival rate compared to wild-type mice after
20 months of age. GABAergic Purkinje cell degeneration in the Cb and aberrant
locomotion were observed in adult Zfp212-KO mice. To identify genes related to
the ataxia-like phenotype of Zfp212-KO mice, 39 ataxia-associated genes in the Cb
were monitored. Substantial alterations in the expression of ataxin 10, protein
phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit beta, protein kinase C gamma, and phospholipase 
D3 (Pld3) were observed. Among them, Pld3 alone was tightly regulated by
Flag-tagged ZNF212 overexpression or Zfp212 knockdown in the HT22 cell line. The 
Cyclic Amplification and Selection of Targets assay identified the TATTTC
sequence as a recognition motif of ZNF212, and these motifs occurred in both
human and mouse PLD3 gene promoters. Adeno-associated virus-mediated introduction
of human ZNF212 into the Cb of 3-week-old Zfp212-KO mice prevented Purkinje cell 
death and motor behavioral deficits. We confirmed the reduction of Zfp212 and
Pld3 in the Cb of an alcohol-induced cerebellar degeneration mouse model,
suggesting that the ZNF212-PLD3 relationship is important for Purkinje cell
survival.
