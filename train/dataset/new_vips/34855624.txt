BACKGROUND: While most children experience mild COVID-19, high-risk children with
underlying conditions may develop severe disease, requiring interventions.
Kinetics of antibodies transferred via COVID-19 convalescent plasma early in
disease, have not been characterized.
METHODS: In this study (NCT04377672), high-risk children were prospectively
enrolled to receive high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (>1:320 anti-spike
IgG; Euroimmun). Passive transfer of antibodies and endogenous antibody
production were serially evaluated for up to 2 months after transfusion.
Commercial and research ELISA assays, virus neutralization assays,
high-throughput phage-display assay utilizing a coronavirus epitope library and
pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Fourteen high-risk children (median age 7.5 years) received high-titer
COVID-19 convalescent plasma, nine children within five days (range 2-7) of
symptom onset and five children within 4 days (range 3-5) after exposure to
SARS-CoV-2. There were no serious adverse events related to transfusion.
Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred from the donor to the recipient, but
antibody titers declined by 14-21 days with a 15.1-day tÂ½ for spike protein IgG. 
Donor plasma had significant neutralization capacity which was transferred to the
recipient. However, as early as 30 minutes post-transfusion, recipient plasma had
low neutralization capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Convalescent plasma transfused to high-risk children appears to be
safe with expected antibody kinetics, regardless of weight or age. However,
current use of convalescent plasma in high-risk children achieves low
neutralizing capacity.
