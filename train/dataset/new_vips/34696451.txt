SARS-CoV-2 infection in children can trigger cardiovascular manifestations
potentially requiring an intensive treatment and defining a new entity named
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), whose features partially
overlap with Kawasaki Disease (KD). A cross-sectional study including all
diagnoses of MIS-C and KD from April 2020 to May 2021 in our metropolitan area
was conducted evaluating clinical, laboratory (including immunological response, 
cytokines, and markers of myocardial damage), and cardiac (coronary and
non-coronary) features at onset of the diseases. Evolution of ventricular
dysfunction, valve regurgitations, and coronary lesions was documented. The
severity of the disease was also considered based on the need for inotropic
support and ICU admission. Twenty-four MIS-C were diagnosed (14 boys, median age 
82 months): 13/24 cases (54.17%) presented left ventricular dysfunction, 12/24
(50%) required inotropic support, and 10/24 (41.67%) developed coronary anomalies
(CALs). All patients received steroids and IVIG at a median time of 5 days
(IQR1:4, IQR3:6.5) from onset of fever and heart function normalized 6 days
(IQR1: 5, IQR3: 7) after therapy, while CALs persisted in one. One patient
(12.5%) required infliximab because of refractory disease and still presented
CALs 18 days after therapy. During the same study period, 15 KD were diagnosed:
none had ventricular dysfunction, while 7/15 (46.67%) developed CALs. Three out
of 15 patients (20%) still presented CALs 46 days from onset. Compared to KD,
MIS-C pts have significantly higher IL8 and similar lymphocytes subpopulations.
Despite a more severe presentation and initial cardiac findings compared to KD,
the myocardial injury in MIS-C has a rapid response to immunomodulatory treatment
(median time 6 days), in terms of ventricular function, valve regurgitations, and
troponin. Incidence of CALs is similar at onset, but it tends to regress in most 
of the cases of MIS-C differently than in KD where CALs persist in up to 40% in
the subacute stage after treatment.
