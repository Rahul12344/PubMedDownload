OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathogenicity of a broad range of 11 possible
gastroenteritis viruses, by means of statistical relationships with cases vs.
controls, or Ct-values, in order to establish the most appropriate diagnostic
panel for our general practitioner (GP) patients in the Netherlands (2010-2012).
METHODS: Archived stool samples from 1340 cases and 1100 controls were retested
using internally controlled multiplex real-time PCRs for putative pathogenic
gastroenteritis viruses: adenovirus, astrovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus,
norovirus GI and GII, human parechovirus, rotavirus, salivirus, sapovirus, and
torovirus.
RESULTS: The prevalence of any virus in symptomatic cases and asymptomatic
controls was 16.6% (223/1340) and 10.2% (112/1100), respectively. Prevalence of
astrovirus (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 10.37; 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.34-80.06) and norovirus GII (aOR 3.10; CI 1.62-5.92) was significantly higher
in cases versus controls. Rotavirus was encountered only in cases. We did not
find torovirus and there was no statistically significant relationship with cases
for salivirus (aOR 1,67; (CI) 0.43-6.54)), adenovirus non-group F (aOR 1.20; CI
0.75-1.91), bocavirus (aOR 0.85; CI 0.05-13.64), enterovirus (aOR 0.83; CI
0.50-1.37), human parechovirus (aOR 1.61; CI 0.54-4.77) and sapovirus (aOR 1.15; 
CI 0.67-1.98). Though adenovirus group F (aOR 6.37; CI 0.80-50.92) and norovirus 
GI (aOR 2.22, CI: 0.79-6.23) are known enteropathogenic viruses and were more
prevalent in cases than in controls, this did not reach significance in this
study. The Ct value did not discriminate between carriage and disease in
PCR-positive subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: In our population, diagnostic gastroenteritis tests should screen
for adenovirus group F, astrovirus, noroviruses GI and GII, and rotavirus.
Case-control studies as ours are lacking and should also be carried out in
populations from other epidemiological backgrounds.
