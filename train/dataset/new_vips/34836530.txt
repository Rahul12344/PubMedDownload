BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies comparing PCT, CRP and WBC levels in the
differential diagnosis of acute bacterial, viral, and mycoplasmal respiratory
tract infections. It is necessary to explore the correlation between above
markers and different types of ARTI.
METHODS: 108 children with confirmed bacterial infection were regarded as group
A, 116 children with virus infection were regarded as group B, and 122 children
with mycoplasmal infection were regarded as group C. The levels of PCT, CRP and
WBC of the three groups were detected and compared.
RESULTS: The levels of PCT, CRP and WBC in group A were significantly higher than
those in groups B and C (p < 0.05). The positive rate of combined detection of
PCT, CRP and WBC was significant higher than that of single detection. There was 
no significant difference in PCT, CRP and WBC levels between the group of G+
bacterial infection and G- bacterial infection (p > 0.05). ROC curve results
showed that the AUC of PCT, CRP and WBC for the diagnosis of bacterial
respiratory infections were 0.65, 0.55, and 0.58, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: PCT, CRP and WBC can be combined as effective indicators for the
identification of acute bacterial or no-bacterial infections in children. The
levels of PCT and CRP have higher differential diagnostic value than that of WBC 
in infection, and the combined examination of the three is more valuable in
clinic.
