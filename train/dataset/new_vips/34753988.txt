In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a state 
of paralysis. During this period, humanity saw by far the largest organized
travel restrictions and unprecedented efforts and global coordination to contain 
the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using large scale human mobility and fine
grained epidemic incidence data, we develop a framework to understand and
quantify the effectiveness of the interventions implemented by various countries 
to control epidemic growth. Our analysis reveals the importance of timing and
implementation of strategic policy in controlling the epidemic. We also unearth
significant spatial diffusion of the epidemic before and during the lockdown
measures in several countries, casting doubt on the effectiveness or on the
implementation quality of the proposed Governmental policies.
