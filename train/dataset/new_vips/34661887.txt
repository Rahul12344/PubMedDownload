In recent years, annual cases of gastroenteritis have been reported in the world 
at high rates, suggesting an association with the consumption of shellfish with
enteric viruses in their tissues. Anthropic activities are considered a source of
environmental pollution and the main responsible for contamination by pathogenic 
microorganisms in aquatic environments. The objective of this study was to
evaluate, by RT-semi-nested PCR, the presence of astrovirus (AstV) and norovirus 
genogroup II (NoV GII) in mussels (Mytella falcata) and oysters (Crassostrea
brasiliana) collected in two sites of the Lagunar Complex of Cananéia, State of
São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 150 samples of mussels and oysters (75 samples
each) were analyzed. AstV was not identified in any shellfish sample. NoV GII was
detected in 21 samples (14%), 8 mussel samples (38%), and 13 oyster samples
(62%). From the 21 positive samples, 16 were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing.
The molecular characterization revealed that Brazilian samples were grouped into 
clades along with other sequences from Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. There was
93.8-100% amino acid sequence similarity among the samples in this study
and > 94.9% when compared with the strains isolated from clinical cases in
Brazil. The screening of shellfish for the presence of health-significant enteric
viruses can help prevent outbreaks among consumers and contribute to the
improvement of the estuarine environment.
