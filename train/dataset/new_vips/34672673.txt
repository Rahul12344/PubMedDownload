INTRODUCTION: In COVID-19 patients, the determination of the relationship between
elevated D-dimer level and prognosis and the determination of thrombosis
formation in the early stages of the disease are very important. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer levels based on
presentation in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19.
METHOD: The study was conducted on patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 11 and April 20, 2020. Patients with 
diseases that could have caused an increase in D-dimer were excluded from the
study.
RESULTS: The evaluation was made across a total of 1,669 patients, comprising 782
(46.9 %) females and 887 (53.1 %) males. The effects of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin,
and troponin on mortality were evaluated with Enter Logistic Regression Analysis,
and the model was found to be significant, with an explanatory coefficient of the
model at a very good level of 91.3 %. The D-dimer scores were determined to be
higher in patients who did not survive. The risk of mortality was seen to be
7.325-fold higher in cases with D-dimer measurement â‰¥0.5.
CONCLUSION: The study results showed that the D-dimer test was an independent
risk factor showing mortality in COVID-19 patients (Tab. 6, Ref. 27). Text in PDF
