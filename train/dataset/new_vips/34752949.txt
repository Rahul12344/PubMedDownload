INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The majority of studies regarding hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) prevention, screening, and treatment have been conducted in urban
populations, and it is unlikely that their findings are broadly generalizable to 
nonurban populations. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and risk factors
of HCV infection in the rural northeastern United States (US) to provide further 
clinical guidance for HCV screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all patients older than
18 years evaluated at an integrated healthcare system, serving northern
Pennsylvania and southern and central New York, who received first-time HCV
screening from January 2014 to December 2019.
RESULTS: 30,549 patients were screened, of which 1.7% were HCV antibody positive.
From 2014 to 2018, the incidence of positive HCV antibody screening cases per
100,000 population increased two-fold from 18.1 in 2014 to 40.4 in 2018. The age 
of positive HCV antibody patients peaked at 29.13 (95% CI 26.15-31.77) and 59.93 
(95% CI 58.71-61.17). Positive HCV antibody was associated with positive urine
drug screen (OR 5.9; 95% CI 3.8-9.3), narcotic use (OR 25.4; 95% CI 8.7-77.8),
and overdose (OR 17.5; 95% CI 3.0-184.6).
CONCLUSIONS: In this rural northeastern US population, there is an increasing
incidence of positive HCV screening with a bimodal age of distribution. Risk
factors associated with opioid use reflect challenges to disease eradication in
this population. We propose a one-time screening for persons aged 35 to 40 will
aid in earlier HCV infection diagnosis and treatment in rural populations.
