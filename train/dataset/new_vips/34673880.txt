OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience report of a nurse providing care to
COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis and in prone position.
METHOD: Experience report. This study was conducted in a philanthropic hospital
in a Brazilian capital from May to August 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic.
RESULTS: The nurse has faced several challenges concerning structure, material,
human resources, and care when treating COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis and in 
prone position. Management based on dialogue and shared evidence-based
information and implementation of a new care protocol were a foundation for care 
reorganization of the Nursing team for providing care to COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSION: This experience emphasizes the importance of nursing care to
patients' responses, with actions based on care protocols, strengthening human
relations. The conduction of different study designs is necessary to contribute
to an improved nursing care and survival of patients experiencing COVID-19
complications.
