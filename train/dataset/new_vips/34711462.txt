Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is the leading vector in emerging treatments of
inherited diseases. Higher transduction efficiencies and cellular specificity are
required for broader clinical application, motivating investigations of
virus-host molecular interactions during cell entry. High-throughput methods are 
identifying host proteins more comprehensively, with subsequent molecular studies
revealing unanticipated complexity and serotype specificity. Cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) provides a path towards structural details of these
sometimes heterogeneous virus-host complexes, and is poised to illuminate more
fully the steps in entry. Here presented, is progress in understanding the
distinct steps of glycan attachment, and receptor-mediated entry/trafficking.
Comparison with structures of antibody complexes provides new insights on immune 
neutralization with implications for the design of improved gene therapy vectors.
