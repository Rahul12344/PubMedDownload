In 2020, the world faced the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that drastically altered people's lives. Since then, many
countries have been forced to suspend public gatherings, leading to many
conference cancellations, postponements, or reorganizations. Switching from a
face-to-face to a remote conference became inevitable and the ultimate solution
to sustain scientific exchanges at the national and the international levels. The
same year, as a committee, we were in charge of organizing the major French
annual conference that covers all computational biology areas: The "Journées
Ouvertes en Biologie, Informatique et Mathématiques" (JOBIM). Despite the health 
crisis, we succeeded in changing the conference format from face to face to
remote in a very short amount of time. Here, we propose 10 simple rules based on 
this experience to modify a conference format in an optimized and cost-effective 
way. In addition to the suggested rules, we decided to emphasize an unexpected
benefit of this situation: a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions related to travel for scientific conference attendance. We believe that
even once the SARS-CoV-2 crisis is over, we collectively will have an opportunity
to think about the way we approach such scientific events over the longer term.
