As of August 2021, there were three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United
States for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this
narrative review is to examine the early experience from the Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA) of BNT162b2 (Pfizer, Inc./BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna,
Inc.), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen Global Services, LLC) through
July 2021. The EUA data from the clinical trials have largely been corroborated
by real-world effectiveness investigations post-authorization. These studies
indicate that immunity is obtained within 2 weeks post-vaccination and may endure
for 6 months. The immunity conferred by the vaccines may also be effective
against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Additionally, populations not included in
the emergency use authorization studies may also benefit from vaccination. This
look back at the initial clinical experience can be used by the global community 
to inform and develop COVID-19 vaccine programs.
