BACKGROUND: Determining the proportion of susceptible workers can represent a
first step to the biological risk assessment related to measles, mumps, rubella
and varicella exposure. This study aimed to assess the immunity against measles, 
mumps, rubella and varicella viruses in a cohort of female school workers.
METHODS: A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study in a sample of 263 school
workers undergoing routine annual workplace health surveillance program was
conducted. As part of the health surveillance program, serum samples were
collected and tested for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella IgG antibodies.
RESULTS: Overall seropositivity was 90.5%, 85.2%, 94.7% and 97.3% for measles,
mumps, rubella and varicella, respectively. In relation to mumps
occupation-specific seropositivity, a statistically significant difference was
observed, showing the lowest prevalence of protected individuals in other
occupation groups. Moreover, in relation to rubella, school workers born in
Centre Italy had the lowest seropositivity of protective antibodies and the
difference between groups was statistically significant. Measles and rubella
seropositivity showed a significant decrease after 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a relevant proportion of school workers
susceptible to the aforementioned diseases. These results highlighted the need
for proper health surveillance and immunological controls in school workers,
especially for females, and provided useful insights to policymakers to select
effective strategies aimed at containing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases
at schools.
