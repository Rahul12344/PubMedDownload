Patients with dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency are susceptible to
development of severe viral cutaneous infections, including herpes simplex virus 
(HSV). We report a 32-month-old girl with homozygous DOCK8 deficiency who
developed a posterior auricular cutaneous lesion that was culture positive for
HSV despite acyclovir prophylaxis. Resolution of this lesion was only observed
after addition of foscarnet to the treatment regimen. Prophylactic acyclovir may 
be insufficient for suppression of cutaneous HSV in patients with DOCK8
deficiency, and a high index of suspicion for viral resistance is necessary for
prompt initiation of appropriate antiviral treatment in these patients.
