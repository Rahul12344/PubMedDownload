OBJECTIVES: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by genetic mutants of
feline enteric coronavirus known as FIPV, is a highly fatal disease of cats with 
no currently available vaccine or US Food and Drug Administration-approved cure. 
Dissemination of FIPV in affected cats results in a range of clinical signs,
including cavitary effusions, anorexia, fever and lesions of pyogranulomatous
vasculitis and perivasculitis, with or without central nervous system or ocular
involvement. The objectives of this study were to screen an array of antiviral
compounds for anti-FIPV (serotype II) activity, determine cytotoxicity safety
profiles of identified compounds with anti-FIPV activity and strategically
combine identified monotherapies to assess compound synergy against FIPV in
vitro. Based upon clinically successful combination treatment strategies for
human patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus infections, we hypothesized that a 
combined anticoronaviral therapy approach featuring concurrent multiple
mechanisms of drug action would result in an additive or synergistic antiviral
effect.
METHODS: This study screened 90 putative antiviral compounds for efficacy and
cytotoxicity using a multimodal in vitro strategy, including plaque bioassays,
real-time RT-PCR viral inhibition and cytotoxicity assays.
RESULTS: Through this process, we identified 26 compounds with effective
antiviral activity against FIPV, representing a variety of drug classes and
mechanisms of antiviral action. The most effective compounds include GC376,
GS-441524, EIDD2081 and EIDD2931. We documented antiviral efficacy for
combinations of antiviral agents, with a few examined drug combinations
demonstrating evidence of limited synergistic antiviral activity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although evidence of compound synergy was identified
for several combinations of antiviral agents, monotherapies were ultimately
determined to be the most effective in the inhibition of viral transcription.
