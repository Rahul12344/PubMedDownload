Enterovirus, like the majority of RNA viruses, evolves to survive the changeable 
environments by a variety of strategies. Here, we showed that HY12 virus evolved 
to alter its characteristics and pathogenicity by employing a non-synonymous
mutation. Analyses of 5'UTR, VP1 and VP2 gene sequences revealed the existence of
HY12 virus in an array of mutants defined as quasispecies. The determination of
diversity and complexity showed that the mutation rate and complexity of HY12
virus quasispecies increased, while the proportion of HY12 VP1 and VP2 consensus 
(master) sequences decreased with increasing passages. Synonymous mutation and
non-synonymous mutation analysis displayed a positive selection for HY12
quasispecies evolution. A comparison of HY12 virus in different passages
demonstrated that HY12 virus altered its characteristic, phenotype, and
pathogenicity via non-synonymous mutation. These findings revealed the evolution 
pattern for HY12 virus, and the alteration of HY12 virus characteristics and
pathogenicity by mutation.
