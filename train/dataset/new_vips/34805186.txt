Non-coding RNAs have been shown to play important regulatory roles, notably in
cancer development. In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs and
circular RNAs in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) by constructing a
circRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network and performing differential expression
analysis on mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs. Specifically, the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infection has been found to be an important risk factor for NPC, and
potential pathological differences may exist for EBV+ and EBV- subtypes of NPC.
By comparing the expression profile of non-cancerous immortalized nasopharyngeal 
epithelial cell line and NPC cell lines, we identified differentially expressed
coding and non-coding RNAs across three groups of comparison: cancer vs.
non-cancer, EBV+ vs. EBV- NPC, and metastatic vs. non-metastatic NPC. We
constructed a ceRNA network composed of mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs, leveraging
co-expression and miRNA target prediction tools. Within the network, we
identified the regulatory ceRNAs of CDKN1B, ZNF302, ZNF268, and RPGR. These
differentially expressed axis, along with other miRNA-circRNA pairs we identified
through our analysis, helps elucidate the genetic and epigenetic changes central 
to NPC progression, and the differences between EBV+ and EBV- NPC.
