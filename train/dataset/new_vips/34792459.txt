For-profit ownership of long-term care (LTC) homes for the elderly is linked to
worse outcomes for residents. In Canada, there has been an increase in
financialized ownership in which seniors' housing (LTC homes and retirement
residences) is run as products for investors. The top 10 firms have doubled their
holdings from 2003 to 2020, and currently 33% of seniors' housing (including 22% 
of LTCs and 42% of retirement homes) is owned by private equity, institutions or 
other financial firms. The business strategies of these firms drive profits not
only from real estate but also from domestic and care operations. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, for-profit and financialized operators in Ontario have stood
out for having higher death rates in their LTC homes. A radical remaking of the
sector is necessary to take the profit out of care.
