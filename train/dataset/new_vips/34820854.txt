BACKGROUND: The mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer) and the
vaccine candidate CVnCoV (Curevac) each encode a stabilized spike protein of
SARS-CoV2 as antigen but differ with respect to the nature of the mRNA (modified 
versus unmodified nucleotides) and the mRNA amount (30 μg versus 12 μg RNA). This
study characterizes antisera elicited by these two vaccines in comparison to
convalescent sera.
METHODS: Sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated healthcare workers, and sera from
participants of a phase I trial vaccinated with 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 μg CVnCoV and
convalescent sera from hospitalized patients were analyzed by ELISA,
neutralization tests, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and peptide arrays.
RESULTS: BNT162b2-elicited sera and convalescent sera have a higher titer of
spike-RBD-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies as compared to the
CVnCoV-elicited sera. For all analyzed sera a reduction in binding and
neutralizing antibodies was found for the lineage B.1.351 variant of concern. SPR
analyses revealed that the CVnCoV-elicited sera have a lower fraction of
slow-dissociating antibodies. Accordingly, the CVnCoV sera almost fail to compete
with the spike-ACE2 interaction. The significance of common VOC mutations K417N, 
E484K, or N501Y focused on linear epitopes was analyzed using a peptide array
approach. The peptide arrays showed a strong difference between convalescent sera
and vaccine-elicited sera. Specifically, the linear epitope at position N501 was 
affected by the mutation and elucidates the escape of viral variants to
antibodies against this linear epitope.
CONCLUSION: These data reveal differences in titer, neutralizing capacity, and
affinity of the antibodies between BNT162b2- and CVnCoV-elicited sera, which
could contribute to the apparent differences in vaccine efficacy.
