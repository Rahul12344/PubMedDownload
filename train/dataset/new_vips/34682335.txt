The recent coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to major lifestyle
changes. The present study sought to assess factors associated with fear to seek 
dental care during COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study 
was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. An online questionnaire was
filled by a convenient sample of adult Saudi residents through mobile instant
messaging application. The following measures were collected: sociodemographic
characteristics, fear of COVID-19 using validated Fears of Illness and Virus
Evaluation scale, fear to seek dental care, perceived health status, and COVID-19
experience. There were 826 participants involved in this study (541 females and
285 males, mean age: 38.8 Â± 13.29 years). Fear to seek dental care was
significantly higher among females, younger age groups, people who perceived poor
general and oral health, and people who perceived high risk of contracting the
virus in dental clinics. After controlling for confounders, fear to seek dental
care was significantly higher among the age group of 35-44 years, those who
perceived high and moderate risk of COVID-19 infection in dental clinics, and
among participants who reported untreated dental conditions. Fear that Others Get
Sick, Fear of the Impact on Social Life, and Behaviors Related to Illness and
Virus Fears were significantly associated with high levels of fear to seek dental
care. Within the study's limitations, fear of COVID-19 negatively impacted the
study population's willingness to seek dental treatment. Factors such as age,
perceived risk of COVID-19 infection in dental clinics, and untreated dental
conditions were associated with fear to seek dental care.
