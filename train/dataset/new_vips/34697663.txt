Benefits of solid organ transplantation in end stage organ diseases are
indisputable. Malignancy is a feared complication of solid organ transplantation 
and is a leading cause of mortality in patients with organ transplantation.
Iatrogenic immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection plays a crucial role in
the cancer development in solid organ transplant recipients. Chronic exposure to 
immunosuppression increases the malignancy burden through deregulation of host
immune defense mechanisms and unchecked proliferation of oncogenic viruses and
malignancies associated with these viruses. Vigorous screening of candidates
undergoing transplant evaluation for malignancies, careful assessment of donors, 
and vigilant monitoring of transplant recipients are necessary to prevent,
detect, and manage this life-threatening complication.
