OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical features
and potential factors related to the time to return negative reverse
transcriptase (RT)-PCR in discharged paediatric patients with COVID-19.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Unscheduled admissions to 12 tertiary hospitals in China.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and thirty-three clinical charts of paediatric patients
with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted from 1 January 2020 to 17 April
2020.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures: factors
associated with the time to return negative RT-PCR from COVID-19 in paediatric
patients.
SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: epidemiological and clinical features and laboratory 
results in paediatric patients.
RESULTS: The median age of patients in our cohort was 7.50 (IQR: 2.92-12.17)
years, and 133 (57.1%) patients were male. 42 (18.0%) patients were evaluated as 
asymptomatic, while 162 (69.5%) and 25 (10.7%) patients were classified as mild
or moderate, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, longer time to negative
RT-PCR was associated with the presence of confirmed infection in family members 
(HR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.41 to 0.79)). Paediatric patients with emesis symptom had a
longer time to return negative (HR (95% CI): 0.33 (0.14 to 0.78)). During
hospitalisation, the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and antiviral
drugs at the same time is less conducive to return negative than antiviral drugs 
alone (HR (95% CI): 0.85 (0.64 to 1.13)).
CONCLUSIONS: The mode of transmission might be a critical factor determining the 
disease severity of COVID-19. Patients with emesis symptom, complications or
confirmed infection in family members may have longer healing time than others.
However, there were no significant favourable effects from TCM when the patients 
have received antiviral treatment.
