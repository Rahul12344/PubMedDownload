Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have been
introduced. To investigate the relationship between vaccine-induced humoral
immunity and patient age, we measured antibody levels and neutralization in
vaccinated sera. Sera from 13 to 17 days after the second dose of the BNT162b2
vaccine were collected from health care workers at the University of Toyama
(n = 740). Antibody levels were measured by the anti-receptor binding domain
antibody test (anti-RBD test), and neutralization against wild-type (WT), α- and 
β-variant pseudotyped viruses were assayed using a high-throughput
chemiluminescent reduction neutralizing test (htCRNT; positivity cutoff, 50%
neutralization at serum dilution 1:100). Basic clinical characteristics were
obtained from questionnaires. Antibodies were confirmed in all participants in
both the anti-RBD test (median, 2,112 U/ml; interquartile range [IQR], 1,275 to
3,390 U/ml) and the htCRNT against WT (median % inhibition, >99.9; IQR, >99.9 to 
>99.9). For randomly selected sera (n = 61), 100.0% had positive htCRNT values
against the α- and β-derived variants. Among those who answered the questionnaire
(n = 237), the values of the anti-RBD test were negatively correlated with age in
females (P < 0.01). An age-dependent decline in neutralization was observed
against the variants but not against the wild-type virus (wild type, P = 0.09; α,
P < 0.01; β, P < 0.01). The neutralizing activity induced by BNT162b2 was
obtained not only against the wild-type virus, but also against the variants;
however, there was an age-dependent decrease in the latter. Age-related
heterogeneity of vaccine-acquired immunity is a concern in preventive strategies 
in the era dominated by variants. IMPORTANCE Since mRNA vaccines utilize
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as an antigen, there are potential concerns
about acquiring immunity to variants of this virus. The neutralizing activity in 
BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was higher against the wild-type virus than
against its variants; this effect was more apparent in older age groups. This
finding suggests that one of the weaknesses of the mRNA vaccine is the high risk 
of variant infection in the elderly population. Because the elderly are at a
higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the age-dependent decline of neutralization 
against viral variants should be considered while planning vaccination programs
that include boosters.
