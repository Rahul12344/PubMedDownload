The SARS-CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted through virus-laden fluid particles
ejected from the mouth of infected people. Face covers can mitigate the risk of
virus transmission but their outward effectiveness is not fully ascertained.
Objective: by using a background oriented schlieren technique, we aim to
investigate the air flow ejected by a person while quietly and heavily breathing,
while coughing, and with different face covers. Results: we found that all face
covers without an outlet valve reduce the front flow through by at least 63% and 
perhaps as high as 86% if the unfiltered cough jet distance was resolved to the
anticipated maximum distance of 2-3 m. However, surgical and handmade masks, and 
face shields, generate significant leakage jets that may present major hazards.
Conclusions: the effectiveness of the masks should mostly be considered based on 
the generation of secondary jets rather than on the ability to mitigate the front
throughflow.
