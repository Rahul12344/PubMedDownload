INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Identification of asymptomatic hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers is fundamental to reach the World
Health Organization objective to eradicate viral hepatitis. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the HBV and HCV prevalence among patients hospitalized for a
non-liver-related disease but showing increased liver enzyme values.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients without history of hepatic disease
but showing increased amino-transferase and/or gamma-glutamil-transpeptidase
levels at admission to the Internal Medicine and Surgery divisions of the Messina
University Hospital from 1st January to 31st December 2019 ("study group") were
tested for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibody. Analogously, HBsAg 
and anti-HCV were tested for in all the individuals with normal liver enzyme
values consecutively admitted from October 1st to December 31st, 2019 ("control
group").
RESULTS: Of the 332 "study group" patients, 13 (3.9%) were anti-HCV positive
versus 5/306 (1.6%) patients of the "control group" (p=0.008). HCV RNA was
detected in 11/13 and in 0/5 anti-HCV patients of the "study group" and "control 
group", respectively (p=0.001). HBsAg was detected in 5 (1.5%) "study group"
patients and in none of the "control group" (p=0.03). Prevalence of diabetes,
arterial hypertension, and dyslipidaemia was comparable between the two groups,
whereas 75/332 (22.3%) patients of the "study group" and 34/306 (11.1%) patients 
of the "control group" drank > 2 alcohol units/day (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Testing HBsAg and anti-HCV in subjects showing increased liver enzyme
values may represent an efficacious tool to identify asymptomatic carriers of
hepatitis virus infections.
