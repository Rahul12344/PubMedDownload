OASs play critical roles in immune response against virus infection by
polymerizing ATP into 2-5As, which initiate the classical OAS/RNase L pathway and
induce degradation of viral RNA. OAS members are functionally diverged in four
known innate immune pathways (OAS/RNase L, OASL/IRF7, OASL/RIG-I, and OASL/cGAS),
but how they functionally diverged is unclear. Here, we focus on evolutionary
patterns and explore the link between evolutionary processes and functional
divergence of Tetrapod OAS1. We show that Palaeognathae and Primate OAS1 genes
are conserved in genomic and protein structures but differ in function. The
former (i.e., ostrich) efficiently synthesized long 2-5A and activated RNase L,
while the latter (i.e., human) synthesized short 2-5A and did not activate RNase 
L. We predicted and verified that two in-frame indels and one positively selected
site in the active site pocket contributed to the functional divergence of
Palaeognathae and Primate OAS1. Moreover, we discovered and validated that an
in-frame indel in the C-terminus of Palaeognathae OAS1 affected the binding
affinity of dsRNA and enzymatic activity, and contributed to the functional
divergence of Palaeognathae OAS1 proteins. Our findings unravel the molecular
mechanism for functional divergence and give insights into the emergence of novel
functions in Tetrapod OAS1.
