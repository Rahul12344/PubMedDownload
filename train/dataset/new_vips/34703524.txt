Purpose of Review: Across the world, medical training has been affected by the
COVID-19 virus and this has changed the way physicians are educated. What is less
clear is the effect of the pandemic on breast surgical oncology fellows who were 
in training during this time. This review discusses the experience of breast
surgical oncology fellows during the pandemic and how fellowships adapted to
preserve the educational experience and conserve the quality of training.
Recent Findings: The challenges and changes experienced by breast surgery fellows
during the COVID-19 pandemic have proved to be sudden shifts in not only
fellowship training, but future patient care and research opportunities, all
while confronting the global impact of a deadly pandemic. While experiences
between fellowships varied, the similarities and differences encountered
highlight the regional and temporal differences in how fellowships responded to
the pandemic.
Summary: Breast surgical oncology fellowship is one year long, with every day
allocated to ensure the surgeon has a deep understanding of the multidisciplinary
approach to this ever-evolving field. As the pandemic spread and affected
different regions with varying severity, elective cases were canceled, resources 
were re-allocated, and uncertainty abounded. At the same time, novel approaches
to fellowship training were rapidly implemented. It will take time and additional
research to fully understand the long-term consequences for trainees affected
during their breast surgery fellowship.
