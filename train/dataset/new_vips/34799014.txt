BACKGROUND: Taste disorders in general, and dysgeusia in particular, are
relatively common disorders that may be a sign of a more complex acute or chronic
medical condition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, taste disorders have found their
way into the realm of general as well as specialty dentistry, with significance
in screening for patients who potentially may have the virus.
TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors searched electronic databases (PubMed,
Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar) for studies focused on dysgeusia,
ageusia, and other taste disorders and their relationship to local and systemic
causes.
RESULTS: The authors found pertinent literature explaining the normal physiology 
of taste sensation, proposals for suggested new tastes, presence of gustatory
receptors in remote tissues of the body, and etiology and pathophysiology of
taste disorders, in addition to the valuable knowledge gained about gustatory
disorders in the context of COVID-19. Along with olfactory disorders, taste
disorders are one of the earliest suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Gustatory disorders are the result of local or systemic etiology or 
both. Newer taste sensations, such as calcium and fat tastes, have been
discovered, as well as taste receptors that are remote from the oropharyngeal
area. Literature published during the COVID-19 pandemic to date reinforces the
significance of early detection of potential patients with COVID-19 by means of
screening for recent-onset taste disorders.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Timely screening and identification of potential
gustatory disorders are paramount for the dental care practitioner to aid in the 
early diagnosis of COVID-19 and other serious systemic disorders.
