In an observational study, the sleeves and pockets of physicians' white coats
often directly or indirectly contacted patients and environmental surfaces. DNA
markers on the sleeves or pockets were frequently transferred to surfaces and
patients. These findings suggest that contaminated white coats have the potential
to contribute to pathogen transmission.
