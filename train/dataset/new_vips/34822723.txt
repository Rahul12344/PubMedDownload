Tomato yellow leaf curl disease which is caused by Tomato yellow leaf curl virus 
(TYLCV) is economically important and a widely spread tomato disease in China.
Rapid and accurate detection methods are important in the control TYLCV. Here, a 
rapid method was developed to identify TYLCV on the basis of recombinase
polymerase amplification (RPA) that can be visualized in 5 min using lateral flow
dipsticks. The sensitivity and the specificity of this method were evaluated.
This method can detect 0.5 pg DNA after 30 min at 37Â°C without any expensive
instrumentation. In addition, it showed higher sensitivity than a PCR method when
purified DNA was used. Moreover, the TYLCV was specifically detected, whereas
other viruses infecting tomato produced negative results. The crude tomato
extracts used in this assay has potential application in minimally equipped plant
clinic laboratories. This method will facilitate the early and rapid detection of
TYLCV for timely application of control measures.
