The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the consumption of social media and online
video platforms in search of an alternative discourse to that provided by
traditional media. The objective of this article is to find an approach to
education and scientific dissemination on COVID-19 present in the Spanish context
of YouTube, focusing on the content analysis of audiovisual texts generated by
creators from the medical and biomedical fields. A methodological orientation was
used for this based on the Grounded Theory, which was applied to five case
studies whose informative material on SARS-CoV-2 exceeded ten million views as of
March 2021. The results reveal the existence of a group of medical professionals 
in the Spanish YouTube sphere who, since the COVID-19 outbreak, have been
involved in the construction of an alternative discourse around the health crisis
and its evolution that pursues a high standard of audiovisual quality, scientific
rigor, and educational ability.
