OpenWHO provides open access, online, free and real time learning responses to
health emergencies. Before the pandemic, courses on 18 diseases were provided.
The increase to 38 courses in response to COVID-19 have led to a massive increase
in the number of new learners. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic affected
learners' trends. This paper presents initial findings of changes perceived in
the use and user groups' attendance to the World Health Organization's (WHO)
health emergency learning platform OpenWHO. Enrolment statistics were based on
data collected in December 2019 and March 2021. A descriptive analysis was
conducted to explore changes in the usage pattern of the platform. Several user
characteristics shifted between before and during the pandemic. More women,
younger and older learners joined the learning during the pandemic. Public health
education leaned toward a more equitable reach including previously
underrepresented groups.
