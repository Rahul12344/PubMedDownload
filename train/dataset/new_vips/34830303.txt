The rapid mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now a major concern with no
effective drugs and treatments. The severity of the disease is linked to the
induction of a cytokine storm that promotes extensive inflammation in the lung,
leading to many acute lung injuries, pulmonary edema, and eventually death.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might prove to be a treatment option as they have
immunomodulation and regenerative properties. Clinical trials utilizing MSCs in
treating acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
have provided a basis in treating post-COVID-19 patients. In this review, we
discussed the effects of MSCs as an immunomodulator to reduce the severity and
death in patients with COVID-19, including the usage of MSCs as an alternative
regenerative therapy in post-COVID-19 patients. This review also includes the
current clinical trials in utilizing MSCs and their potential future utilization 
for long-COVID treatments.
