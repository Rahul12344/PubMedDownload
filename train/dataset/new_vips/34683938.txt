The use of short oligonucleotide or peptide molecules as target-specific aptamers
has recently garnered substantial attention in the field of the detection and
treatment of viral infections. Based on their high affinity and high specificity 
to desired targets, their use is on the rise to replace antibodies for the
detection of viruses and viral antigens. Furthermore, aptamers inhibit
intracellular viral transcription and translation, in addition to restricting
viral entry into host cells. This has opened up a plethora of new targets for the
research and development of novel vaccines against viruses. Here, we discuss the 
advances made in aptamer technology for viral diagnosis and therapy in the past
decade.
