Objective: Frontline health-care workers and patients with COVID-19 have been
identified as high-risk groups for psychological problems. Experience of working 
or staying in quarantine wards generated psychological stressors for health-care 
workers and patients with COVID-19. The present study aimed to investigate the
psychological symptoms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and the health-care
workers treating them during the outbreak period, examine the effects of
psychological stressors on mental health in both populations and perceived coping
resources for both sides. Methods: Three hundred and eleven health-care workers
working in a COVID-19 designated hospital in Wuhan, China, and 148 hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 in the same hospital participated in this cross-sectional 
survey conducted in February 2020. Psychological symptoms, psychological
stressors, and perceived coping resources were reported by both groups. Results: 
Thirty-three percent of health-care workers and 35.2% of patients with COVID-19
had significant psychological symptoms that were indicative of a high risk for
psychological disorders. Pandemic-related psychological stressors contributed to 
psychological symptoms for both populations. Concern about patients was one
aspect of psychological stressors of frontline health-care workers and both
groups perceived support from the opposite side as an important external coping
resource. Conclusion: The results shed light on the need to provide psychological
support to both frontline health-care workers and patients with COVID-19 and
suggest enhancing the treatment alliance might be effective to improve mental
health for both populations during the crisis.
