The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance reduces the effectiveness of
antimicrobial drugs in preventing and treating infectious diseases caused by
pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Because of the
burgeoning growth of microbes with antimicrobial-resistant traits, there is a
dire need to identify and develop novel and effective antimicrobial agents to
treat infections from antimicrobial-resistant strains. The marine environment is 
rich in ecological biodiversity and can be regarded as an untapped resource for
prospecting novel bioactive compounds. Therefore, exploring the marine
environment for antimicrobial agents plays a significant role in drug development
and biomedical research. Several earlier scientific investigations have proven
that bacterial diversity in the marine environment represents an emerging source 
of structurally unique and novel antimicrobial agents. There are several reports 
on marine bacterial secondary metabolites, and many are pharmacologically
significant and have enormous promise for developing effective antimicrobial
drugs to combat microbial infections in drug-resistant pathogens. In this review,
we attempt to summarize published articles from the last twenty-five years
(1996-2020) on antimicrobial secondary metabolites from marine bacteria evolved
in marine environments, such as marine sediment, water, fauna, and flora.
