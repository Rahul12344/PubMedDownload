Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaneoic acid (DHA) and
eicosapentaneoic acid (EPA), play a critical role in a variety of neuronal
functions, including facilitating neuronal growth and differentiation, increasing
the density of the neuritic network, modulating cell membrane fluidity,
regulating intracellular signaling and gene expression, and exhibiting
antioxidant characteristics. Dietary DHA is selectively enriched and actively
retained in the central nervous system, mainly in synaptic membranes, dendrites, 
and photoreceptors. In this review, we highlight the myriad roles of PUFAs in
brain function and human health. Diets rich in DHA are inversely proportional to 
cognitive decline and incidence of neurodegenerative disorders. Conversely, diets
deficient in DHA impair the proper development of brain and the visual system in 
children and increase risk of brain disorders in the elderly. Finally, DHA and
EPA have been shown to reduce inflammation and may prove to be beneficial in
reducing the severity of the SARS-COVID infection.
