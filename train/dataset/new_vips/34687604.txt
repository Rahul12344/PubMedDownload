Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) are a target for broad-spectrum
antiviral therapeutic agents. Recently, we demonstrated that incorporation of the
T-1106 triphosphate, a pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide, into nascent RNA
increases pausing and backtracking by the poliovirus RdRp. Here, by monitoring
enterovirus A-71 RdRp dynamics during RNA synthesis using magnetic tweezers, we
identify the "backtracked" state as an intermediate used by the RdRp for
copy-back RNA synthesis and homologous recombination. Cell-based assays and RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments further demonstrate that the
pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide stimulates these processes during infection. 
These results suggest that pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotides do not induce
lethal mutagenesis or chain termination but function by promoting template
switching and formation of defective viral genomes. We conclude that
RdRp-catalyzed intra- and intermolecular template switching can be induced by
pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotides, defining an additional mechanistic class of
antiviral ribonucleotides with potential for broad-spectrum activity.
