The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus significantly affected daily life, but 
the highest pressure was piled on the health care system. Our aim was to evaluate
an impact of COVID-19 pandemic management measures on cancer services at the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Lithuania. We assessed the time period from 1 
February 2020 to 31 December 2020 and compared it to the same period of 2019.
Data for our analysis were extracted from the NCI Hospital Information System
(HIS) and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). Contingency table analysis
and ANOVA were performed. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the cancer
services provided by NCI. Reductions in diagnostic radiology (-16%) and endoscopy
(-29%) procedures were accompanied by a decreased number of patients with ongoing
medical (-30%), radiation (-6%) or surgical (-10%) treatment. The changes in the 
number of newly diagnosed cancer patients were dependent on tumor type and
disease stage, showing a rise in advanced disease at diagnosis already during the
early period of the first lockdown. The extent of out-patient consultations
(-14%) and disease follow-up visits (-16%) was also affected by the pandemic, and
only referrals to psychological/psychiatric counselling were increased.
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the structure of cancer
services by fostering the application of modified systemic anticancer therapy or 
hypofractionated radiotherapy. The most dramatic drop occurred in the number of
patients participating in cancer prevention programs; the loss was 25% for colon 
cancer and 62% for breast cancer screening. Marked restriction in access to
preventive cancer screening and overall reduction of the whole spectrum of cancer
services may negatively affect cancer survival measures in the nearest future.
