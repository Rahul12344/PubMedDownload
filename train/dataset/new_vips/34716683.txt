Combinatorial antibody libraries not only effectively reduce antibody discovery
to a numbers game, but enable documentation of the history of antibody responses 
in an individual. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has prompted a wider application of this technology to meet
the public health challenge of pandemic threats in the modern era. Herein, a
combinatorial human antibody library constructed 20 years before the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is used to discover three highly potent
antibodies that selectively bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralize
authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Compared to neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19
patients with generally low somatic hypermutation (SHM), these three antibodies
contain over 13-22 SHMs, many of which are involved in specific interactions in
their crystal structures with SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. The
identification of these somatically mutated antibodies in a pre-pandemic library 
raises intriguing questions about the origin and evolution of these antibodies
with respect to their reactivity with SARS-CoV-2.
