Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), caused by bovine alphaherpesvirus 1
(BoHV-1), is an important disease affecting cattle worldwide resulting in great
economic losses. Marker vaccines are effective in controlling infectious diseases
including IBR, because they allow the discrimination between the natural
infection and the vaccination. Therefore, a triple gene deleted strain BoHV-1
gG-/tk-/gE- was developed and evaluated in vivo and in vitro as a marker vaccine.
In cell culture, this triple mutant virus showed significantly slower growth
kinetics and smaller plaques when compared to wild-type (wt) BoHV-1 and double
mutant BoHV-1 gG-/tk- (p < 0.01). On proteomic level, it revealed downregulation 
of some virulence related proteins including thymidine kinase, glycoproteins G,
E, I, and K when compared to the wt. In vitro, the triple mutant virus showed a
significantly lower and shorter viral shedding period (p < 0.001) in calves
compared to double mutant. Moreover, the immunized calves with triple mutant
virus showed protection rates of 64.2% and 68.6% against wt BoHV-1 and wt BoHV-5 
challenge, respectively, without reactivation of latency after dexamethasone
injection. In conclusion, BoHV-1 gG-/tk-/gE- is a safer marker vaccine against
IBR although its immunogenicity in calves was decreased when compared to double
mutant virus.
