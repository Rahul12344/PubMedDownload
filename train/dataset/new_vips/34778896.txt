In this review, we provide an overview of developments in point-of-care (POC)
diagnostics during the COVID-19 pandemic. We review these advances within the
framework of a holistic POC ecosystem, focusing on points of interest - both
technological and non-technological - to POC researchers and test developers.
Technologically, we review design choices in assay chemistry, microfluidics, and 
instrumentation towards nucleic acid and protein detection for severe acute
respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and away from the lab bench, developments
that supported the unprecedented rapid development, scale up, and deployment of
POC devices. We describe common features in the POC technologies that obtained
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for nucleic acid, antigen, and antibody tests, 
and how these tests fit into four distinct POC use cases. We conclude with
implications for future pandemics, infectious disease monitoring, and digital
health.
