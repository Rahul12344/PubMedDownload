Objective To describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the incidence of
paediatric viral respiratory tract infection in Oxfordshire, UK. Methods Data on 
paediatric Emergency Department (ED) attendances (0-15 years inclusive),
respiratory virus testing, vital signs and mortality at Oxford University
Hospitals were summarised using descriptive statistics. Results Between
1-March-2016 and 30-July-2021, 155,056 ED attendances occurred and 7,195
respiratory virus PCRs were performed. Detection of all pathogens was suppressed 
during the first national lockdown. Rhinovirus and adenovirus rates increased
when schools reopened September-December 2020, then fell, before rising in
March-May 2021. The usual winter RSV peak did not occur in 2020/21, with an
inter-seasonal rise (32/1,000 attendances in 0-3 yr olds) in July 2021. Influenza
remained suppressed throughout. A higher paediatric early warning score (PEWS)
was seen for attendees with adenovirus during the pandemic compared to
pre-pandemic (p = 0.04, Mann-Witney U test), no other differences in PEWS were
seen. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 caused major changes in the incidence of paediatric 
respiratory viral infection in Oxfordshire, with implications for clinical
service demand, testing strategies, timing of palivizumab RSV prophylaxis, and
highlighting the need to understand which public health interventions are most
effective for preventing respiratory virus infections.
