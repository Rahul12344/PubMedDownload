PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute central and peripheral nervous system injury may occur
in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus. This review will
assist readers to recognize neurologic manifestations associated with COVID-19
including common and life-threatening symptoms and diagnostic testing. We will
also review current recommendations for treatment of neurologic injury associated
with COVID-19 infection in children.
RECENT FINDINGS: Data from systematic reviews and prospectively collected cohorts
of children with COVID-19 are beginning to characterize the breadth of neurologic
manifestations associated with COVID-19 in the acute infectious and
postinfectious periods. Among hospitalized children in particular, neurologic
symptoms are common. Life threatening conditions including encephalitis,
myelitis, stroke, and demyelinating syndromes have been reported. Within the
pediatric population, age, and preexisting neurologic conditions appear to be
important factors in determining likely phenotypes. Treatment at this time is
based on careful neuromonitoring, supportive care, and neuromodulatory therapies 
as indicated.
SUMMARY: Neurologic symptoms are common in children with COVID-19 and may be life
threatening. The pathophysiology, therapeutic options, and long-term outcomes
from COVID-19 associated neurologic injury are currently being investigated.
