OBJECTIVES: To develop and cross-validate self-administered Rapid Geriatric
Assessment (SA-RGA) app against administered Rapid Geriatric Assessment (A-RGA)
to identify seniors with geriatric syndromes such as frailty, sarcopenia, and
anorexia of ageing who may benefit from targeted intervention.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Primary Care and Community.
PARTICIPANTS: A-RGA and SA-RGA app were administered to older adults ≥ 60 years
old from December 2020 to April 2021.
MEASUREMENTS: The RGA app screens for frailty (FRAIL), sarcopenia (SARC-F),
anorexia of aging (SNAQ) and cognition (Rapid Cognitive Screen) with assisted
management pathway. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 is administered for those who 
score positive for fatigue. The diagnostic performance of SA-RGA was compared
against A-RGA as a reference by calculating the sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and positive 
likelihood ratio (+LR).
RESULTS: 123 participants with a mean age of 71 ± 5.9 years completed both the
SA-RGA and A-RGA. Questions on fatigue, 5 or more illnesses, loss of weight and
falls in the past year performed better with high sensitivity, specificity, NPV
and +LR than self-functional assessment where SA-RGA participants reported lower 
prevalence on the FRAIL scale aerobic and resistance components, and higher
prevalence on the SARC-F strength and rising from a chair components.
CONCLUSION: The SA-RGA app performed well in certain domains such as assessment
for weight loss, falls, number of chronic illness and fatigue. Self-functional
assessment can be improved further by removing ambiguity in wordings such as
"some" or "a lot" and replacing it with functional difficulty scale. SA-RGA has
the potential to be incorporated in the eHEALTH platforms worldwide for early
identifications of older adults at risk and to reduce health inequalities, at the
same time building community resilience in the era of Covid-19 pandemic.
