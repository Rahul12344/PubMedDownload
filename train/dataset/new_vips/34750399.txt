SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged worldwide, with implications
on the spread of the pandemic. Characterizing the cross-reactivity of antibodies 
against these VOCs is necessary to understand the humoral response of
non-hospitalized individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, a population
that remains understudied. Thirty-two SARS-CoV-2-positive (PCR-confirmed) and
non-hospitalized Canadian adults were enrolled 14-21 days post-diagnosis in 2020,
before the emergence of the B.1.351 (also known as Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and
P.1 (Gamma) VOCs. Sera were collected 4 and 16 weeks post-diagnosis. Antibody
levels and pseudo-neutralization of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein/human ACE-2 receptor interaction were analyzed with native, B.1.351,
B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins. Despite a lower response observed for
the variant spike proteins, we report evidence of a sustained humoral response
against native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins among
non-hospitalized Canadian adults. Furthermore, this response inhibited the
interaction between the spike proteins from the different VOCs and ACE-2 receptor
for ≥ 16 weeks post-diagnosis, except for individuals aged 18-49 years who showed
no inhibition of the interaction between B.1.617.1 or B.1.617.2 spike and ACE-2. 
Interestingly, the affinity (KD) measured between the spike proteins (native,
B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1) and antibodies elicited in sera of infected and
vaccinated (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) individuals was invariant. Relative to 
sera from vaccine-naïve (and previously infected) individuals, sera from
vaccinated individuals had higher antibody levels (as measured with label-free
SPR) and more efficiently inhibited the spike-ACE-2 interactions, even among
individuals aged 18-49 years, showing the effectiveness of vaccination.
