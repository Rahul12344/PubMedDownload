Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes a severe infection in ruminant
animals. Here we present an in-depth transcriptional analysis of soft-palate
tissue from cattle experimentally infected with FMDV. The differentially
expressed genes from two Indian cattle (Bos indicus) breeds (Malnad Gidda and
Hallikar) and Holstein Friesian (HF) crossbred calves, highlighted the activation
of metabolic processes, mitochondrial functions and significant enrichment of
innate antiviral immune response pathways in the indigenous calves. The results
of RT-qPCR based validation of 12 genes was in alignment with the transcriptome
data. The indigenous calves showing lesser virus load, elicited early
neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ immune responses. This study revealed that
induction of potent innate antiviral response and cell mediated immunity in
indigenous cattle, especially Malnad Gidda, significantly restricted FMDV
replication during acute infection. These data highlighting the molecular
processes associated with host-pathogen interactions, could aid in the conception
of novel strategies to prevent and control FMDV infection in cattle.
