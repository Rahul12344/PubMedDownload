BACKGROUND: The primary purpose of screening is to detect individuals in danger
of cervical cancer so as to prevent further progression of the disease. Cervical 
cancer remains a global concern, as it ranks as the fourth most commonly
diagnosed female malignancy worldwide. It is the commonest female cancer in
Zimbabwe. Women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a
disproportionate risk of invasive cervical cancer, as they are 2-12 times more
likely to develop pre-cancerous lesions. As a result of the increased risk,
routine screenings are suggested. Few women are screened for cervical cancer in
Zimbabwe.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at describing the experiences of screening for
cervical cancer and motivation behind screening.
METHOD: The study employed a qualitative research approach. In-depth one to one
interviews and focus group discussions were conducted using interview and focus
group guides. The study was conducted at an opportunistic infections clinic in
Mpilo Central Hospital. Data analysis was performed by using Giorgi's descriptive
method of data analysis.
RESULTS: The themes that emerged from data analysis were facilitators to
screening for cervical cancer, community awareness of cervical cancer screening, 
free cervical cancer treatment and more screening centres and integrating
cervical cancer screening with HIV care.
CONCLUSION: In-depth understanding of the factors that enable women to take part 
in cervical cancer screening is essential so that these factors can be
strengthened to improve uptake of cervical cancer screening services.
