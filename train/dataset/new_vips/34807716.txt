BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is more severe in transplant recipients. Variants of concern
have supplanted wild-type virus. In transplant recipients, data are limited on
2-dose or 3-dose vaccine immunogenicity against variant viruses.
OBJECTIVE: To assess neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants 
in transplant recipients after 2 and 3 vaccine doses.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of a
third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine versus placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT04885907).
SETTING: Single-center transplant program.
PATIENTS: Organ transplant recipients.
INTERVENTION: Third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine versus placebo.
MEASUREMENTS: Sera were analyzed for neutralization against wild-type virus and
the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants using a surrogate virus neutralization assay 
and a spike-pseudotyped lentivirus assay.
RESULTS: A total of 117 transplant recipients were analyzed (60 in the mRNA-1273 
group and 57 in the placebo group). Sera were obtained before and 4 to 6 weeks
after the third dose. After 2 doses, the proportion of patients with positive
neutralization for all 3 variants was small compared with wild-type virus. After 
the third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the proportion with a positive
neutralization response versus placebo was improved for all 3 variants as
measured by both assays. Based on the pseudovirus neutralization assay against
the Delta variant, 33 of 60 (55%) patients were positive in the mRNA-1273 group
versus 10 of 57 (18%) in the placebo group (difference, 37 [95% CI, 19 to 53]
percentage points). The differences were 36 (CI, 17 to 51) percentage points for 
the Alpha variant and 31 (CI, 15 to 46) percentage points for the Beta variant.
In the mRNA-1273 group, lower neutralization values were observed for variants
compared with wild-type virus, especially the Beta variant.
LIMITATIONS: There is no clear correlate of protection for neutralizing antibody.
This was a secondary analysis.
CONCLUSION: In organ transplant recipients, a third dose of mRNA vaccine
increases neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 variants compared
with placebo.
