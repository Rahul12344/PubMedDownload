INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to examine attitudes of the general population towards 
reasonableness of these costs, as well as the degree to which these costs are
shared across society (solidarity financing) and to determine the factors
associated with them.
METHOD: Repeated cross-sectional data from a nationally representative
online-survey. More precisely, data from wave 8 (21-22 April 2020) and wave 16
(7-8 July 2020) were used (in wave 8: analytical sample with n = 976, average age
was 47.0 years (SD: 15.3 years), ranging from 18 to 74 years, 51.8% female; in
wave 16: analytical sample with n = 978, average age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.9
years), ranging from 18 to 74 years, 50.9% female). After a short introduction
emphasizing considerable economic costs associated with the measures against the 
spread of the coronavirus, individuals were asked to rate the following
statements (outcome measures), in each case from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 =
strongly agree: "These economic costs are currently reasonable in relation to the
objective pursued" (reasonableness of costs), "These economic costs should be
borne jointly by all citizens and depending on income" (solidarity financing).
RESULTS: In wave 8 (wave 16 in parentheses), the average rating for the attitude 
towards reasonableness of costs was 4.3, SD: 1.8 (wave 16, average: 4.2, SD: 1.8)
and the average rating for the attitude towards solidarity financing was 3.7, SD:
1.9 (wave 16, average: 3.3, SD: 2.0). In wave 8, more positive attitudes towards 
the reasonableness of costs and solidarity financing were associated with being
male, higher education, not being in a partnership/being unmarried, higher affect
regarding COVID-19 and higher presumed severity with respect to COVID-19.
Furthermore, more positive attitudes towards the reasonableness of costs were
associated with having a migration background. More positive attitudes towards
solidarity financing was associated with higher age groups. Mainly similar
findings were observed in wave 16.
DISCUSSION: Agreement with reasonableness of costs of preventative measures as
well as solidarity financing was moderately high. Knowledge of these attitudes is
important to ensure social cohesion during the fight against COVID-19.
