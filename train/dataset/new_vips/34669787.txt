OBJECTIVE: To analyze the scientific production on the decision making of health 
workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Integrative review in the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus,
ScienceDirect, WoS, and BVS. Inclusion criteria: original articles available in
full, in any language, related to the object investigated.
RESULTS: During this pandemic, health workers have been making decisions based on
ethical/bioethical principles (utility, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy,
justice, proportionality, flexibility, clinical prognosis, duration of the need, 
and fair health attention), values (solidarity, equality, equity, utilitarianism,
relational autonomy, reliability, reciprocity, maximization of the benefits and
resources, and prioritization of those in worse conditions), beliefs and personal
motivation, protocols, directives, tools, algorithms, recommendations, and
criteria.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Decision making has never been so necessary as in this
pandemic. This article is not a recipe for the professionals, since decision
making is based on numerous factors. However, it provides them with a foundation 
that can be helpful in this difficult process.
