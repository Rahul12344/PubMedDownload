OBJECTIVES: To examine public views on COVID-19 vaccination and consider the
implications for communications and targeted support.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Online and telephone nationally representative survey in Great Britain, 
January to February 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: 4978 adults. Survey response rate was 84%, among the 5931
panellists invited.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, 
education, financial status), COVID-19 status, vaccine acceptance, trust in
COVID-19 vaccination information sources, perceptions of vaccination priority
groups and perceptions of importance of second dose.
RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (83%) was associated with increasing age,
higher level of education and having been invited for vaccination. Acceptance
decreased with unconfirmed past COVID-19, greater financial hardship and
non-white British ethnicity; black/black British participants had lowest
acceptance. Overall, healthcare and scientific sources of information were most
trusted. Compared with white British participants, other ethnicities had lower
trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with lower educational
attainment or financial hardship had lower trust in healthcare and scientific
sources. Those with no qualifications had higher trust in media and
family/friends. While trust was low overall in community or faith leaders, it was
higher among those with Asian/Asian British and black/black British ethnicity
compared with white British participants. Views of vaccine prioritisation were
mostly consistent with UK official policy but there was support for prioritising 
additional groups. There was high support for having the second vaccine dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted engagement is needed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy 
in non-white British ethnic groups, in younger adults, and among those with lower
education, greater financial hardship and unconfirmed past infection. Healthcare 
professionals and scientific advisors should play a central role in
communications and tailored messaging is needed for hesitant groups. Careful
communication around vaccination prioritisation continues to be required.
