Hançerli Törün S, Yilmaz Çiftdoğan D, Kara A.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, children can be infected with the virus that 
causes COVID-19. Clinical symptoms of children with COVID from China where the
disease was first reported, generally were less severe than adults. However, at
the end of April 2020 in Europe, it was observed that some children with
SARS-CoV-2 infection developed fever, abdominal pain, shock, myocardial
insufficiency, and the need for an intensive care unit. This new disease has been
called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Although the
pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear, it progresses with signs of multi-organ
involvement as a result of uncontrolled inflammation of the immune system and
even causes death. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with MIS-C 
should be managed quickly. In this review; The pathophysiology, clinical and
laboratory findings, diagnostic methods, and treatment regimens of MIS-C were
discussed.
