COVID-19, an acute viral pneumonia, has emerged as a devastating pandemic. Drug
repurposing allows researchers to find different indications of FDA-approved or
investigational drugs. In this current study, a sequence of pharmacophore and
molecular modeling-based screening against COVID-19 Mpro (PDB: 6LU7) suggested a 
subset of drugs, from the Drug Bank database, which may have antiviral activity. 
A total of 44 out of 8823 of the most promising virtual hits from the Drug Bank
were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation experiments to explore the
strength of their interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site. MD findings 
point toward three drugs (DB04020, DB12411, and DB11779) with very low relative
free energies for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with interactions at His41 and Met49. MD
simulations identified an additional interaction with Glu166, which enhanced the 
binding affinity significantly. Therefore, Glu166 could be an interesting target 
for structure-based drug design. Quantitative structural-activity relationship
analysis was performed on the 44 most promising hits from molecular docking-based
virtual screening. Partial least square regression accurately predicted the
values of independent drug candidates' binding energy with impressively high
accuracy. Finally, the EC50 and CC50 of 10 drug candidates were measured against 
SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Nilotinib and bemcentinib had EC50 values of 2.6 and 
1.1 Î¼M, respectively. In summary, the results of our computer-aided drug design
provide a roadmap for rational drug design of Mpro inhibitors and the discovery
of certified medications as COVID-19 antiviral therapeutics.
