BACKGROUND: Aside from human papillomavirus (HPV), the role of other risk factors
in cervical cancer such as age, education, parity, sexual partners, smoking and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been described but never ranked in order 
of priority. We evaluated the contribution of several known lifestyle co-risk
factors for cervical cancer among black South African women.
METHODS: We used participant data from the Johannesburg Cancer Study, a
case-control study of women recruited mainly at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg
Academic Hospital between 1995 and 2016. A total of 3,450 women in the study had 
invasive cervical cancers, 95% of which were squamous cell carcinoma. Controls
were 5,709 women with cancers unrelated to exposures of interest. Unconditional
logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORadj)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We ranked these risk factors by their
population attributable fractions (PAF), which take the local prevalence of
exposure among the cases and risk into account.
RESULTS: Cervical cancer in decreasing order of priority was associated with (1) 
being HIV positive (ORadj = 2.83, 95% CI = 2.53-3.14, PAF = 17.6%), (2) lower
educational attainment (ORadj = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.44-1.77, PAF = 16.2%), (3)
higher parity (3+ children vs 2-1 children (ORadj = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.07-1.46, PAF
= 12.6%), (4) hormonal contraceptive use (ORadj = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.24-1.77, PAF =
8.9%), (5) heavy alcohol consumption (ORadj = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15-1.81, PAF =
5.6%), (6) current smoking (ORadj = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.41-1.91, PAF = 5.1%), and
(7) rural residence (ORadj = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.44-1.77, PAF = 4.4%).
CONCLUNSION: This rank order of risks could be used to target educational
messaging and appropriate interventions for cervical cancer prevention in South
African women.
