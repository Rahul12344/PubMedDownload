BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People who inject drugs (PWID) and other marginalized
populations with high hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection rates represent a unique 
challenge for treatment initiation due to health, administrative and social
barriers. We analysed the HCV cascade of care (CoC) in some vulnerable
subpopulations in Madrid, Spain, when using a mobile point-of-care (PoC).
METHODS: From 2019 to 2021, a mobile unit was used to screen active HCV using a
linkage-to-care and two-step PoC-based strategy. Viremic participants were
grouped into four subgroups: PWID, homeless individuals and people with a mental 
health disorder (MHD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Logistic regression, and
Cox and Aalen's additive models were used to analyse associated factors and
differences between groups.
RESULTS: A prospectively recruited cohort of 214 HCV-infected individuals (73
PWID, 141 homeless, 57 with a MHD and 91 with AUD) participated in the study. The
overall HCV CoC analysis found that 178 (83.1%) attended a hospital, 164 (76.6%) 
initiated direct-acting antiviral therapy and 141 (65.8%) completed therapy, of
which 99 (95.2%) achieved sustained virological response (SVR). PWID were
significantly less likely to initiate treatment, whereas individuals with AUD
waited longer before starting the treatment. Both people with AUD and PWID were
significantly less likely to complete HCV treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, SVR was achieved in the majority of the participants
treated. However, PWID need better linkage to care and treatment, whereas PWID
and AUD need more support for treatment completion.
