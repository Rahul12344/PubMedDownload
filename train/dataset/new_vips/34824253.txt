The bat sarbecovirus RaTG13 is a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, this bat virus was most likely unable to directly
infect humans since its Spike (S) protein does not interact efficiently with the 
human ACE2 receptor. Here, we show that a single T403R mutation increases binding
of RaTG13 S to human ACE2 and allows VSV pseudoparticle infection of human lung
cells and intestinal organoids. Conversely, mutation of R403T in the SARS-CoV-2 S
reduces pseudoparticle infection and viral replication. The T403R RaTG13 S is
neutralized by sera from individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 indicating that 
vaccination might protect against future zoonoses. Our data suggest that a
positively charged amino acid at position 403 in the S protein is critical for
efficient utilization of human ACE2 by S proteins of bat coronaviruses. This
finding could help to better predict the zoonotic potential of animal
coronaviruses.
