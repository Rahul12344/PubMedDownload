Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed millions 
of people and continues to cause massive global upheaval. Coronaviruses are
positive-strand RNA viruses with an unusually large genome of ~30 kb. They
express an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a cohort of other replication enzymes
and supporting factors to transcribe and replicate their genomes. The proteins
performing these essential processes are prime antiviral drug targets, but drug
discovery is hindered by our incomplete understanding of coronavirus RNA
synthesis and processing. In infected cells, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
must coordinate with other viral and host factors to produce both viral mRNAs and
new genomes. Recent research aiming to decipher and contextualize the structures,
functions and interplay of the subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 replication and
transcription complex proteins has burgeoned. In this Review, we discuss recent
advancements in our understanding of the molecular basis and complexity of the
coronavirus RNA-synthesizing machinery. Specifically, we outline the mechanisms
and regulation of RNA translation, replication and transcription. We also discuss
the composition of the replication and transcription complexes and their
suitability as targets for antiviral therapy.
