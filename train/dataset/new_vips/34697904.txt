BACKGROUND: We assessed the ability to identify key data relevant to influenza
and other respiratory virus surveillance in a large-scale US-based hospital
electronic medical record (EMR) dataset using seasonal influenza as a use case.
We describe characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized influenza cases across
three seasons.
METHODS: We identified patients with an influenza diagnosis between March 2017
and March 2020 in 140 US hospitals as part of the US FDA's Sentinel System. We
calculated descriptive statistics on the presence of high-risk conditions,
influenza antiviral administrations, and severity endpoints.
RESULTS: Among 5.1 million hospitalizations, we identified 29,520
hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis; 64% were treated with an influenza 
antiviral within 2 days of admission, and 25% were treated >2 days after
admission. Patients treated >2 days after admission had more comorbidities than
patients treated within 2 days of admission. Patients never treated during
hospitalization had more documentation of cardiovascular and other diseases than 
treated patients. We observed more severe endpoints in patients never treated
(death = 3%, mechanical ventilation [MV] = 9%, intensive care unit [ICU] = 26%)
or patients treated >2 days after admission (death = 2%, MV = 14%, ICU = 32%)
than in patients treated earlier (treated on admission: death = 1%, MV = 5%,
ICU = 23%, treated within 2 days of admission: death = 1%, MV = 7%, ICU = 27%).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified important trends in influenza severity related to
treatment timing in a large inpatient dataset, laying the groundwork for the use 
of this and other inpatient EMR data for influenza and other respiratory virus
surveillance.
