European perch (Perca fluviatilis) are increasingly farmed as a human food
source. Viral infections of European perch remain largely unexplored, thereby
putting farm populations at incalculable risk for devastating fish epizootics and
presenting a potential hazard to consumers. To address these concerns, we applied
metatranscriptomics to identify disease-associated viruses in European perch
farmed in Switzerland. Unexpectedly, in clinically diseased fish we detected
novel freshwater fish filoviruses, a novel freshwater fish hantavirus, and a
previously unknown rhabdovirus. Hantavirus titers were high, and we demonstrated 
virus in macrophages and gill endothelial cells by using in situ hybridization.
Rhabdovirus titers in organ samples were low, but virus could be isolated on cell
culture. Our data add to the hypothesis that filoviruses, hantaviruses, and
rhabdoviruses are globally distributed common fish commensals, pathogens, or
both. Our findings shed new light on negative-sense RNA virus diversity and
evolution.
