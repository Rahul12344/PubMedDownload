PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the past year, the fast spread of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) has represented a global health threat, especially for cancer
patients, that has required an urgent reorganization of clinical activities.
Here, we will critically revise the profound impact that the pandemic has
generated in lung cancer patients, as well the most significant challenges that
oncologists have to face to maintain the highest possible standards in the
management of lung cancer patients in the pandemic era.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evidences suggested a higher susceptibility and mortality of
lung cancer patients due to COVID-19. The hard management of this patient
population has been also due to the potential cross interference of anti-tumor
drugs on SARS-Cov-2 infection and to the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 
pneumonitis and drug-related pneumonitis. COVID-19 pandemic has generated a
profound reshaping of oncological activities and the development of
recommendations by the oncology scientific community to prioritize anti-tumor
treatments for lung cancer patients.
