The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to have more severe health
outcomes in older people specifically in relation to mortality and disability.
Vaccination seems to be efficacious and safe for preventing the negative
consequences of COVID-19, but vaccine hesitancy seems to be high in older adults.
We therefore aimed to investigate the prevalence of unwillingness and the
uncertainty to vaccinate against COVID-19 in older people and the factors that
can be associated with the unwillingness to vaccinate. For this work, we searched
several databases until 18th June 2021 for studies reporting the prevalence of
unwillingness and the uncertainty to vaccinate against COVID-19 in people aged
>60 years. A meta-analysis of the prevalence, with the correspondent 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), was proposed. Factors that can be associated with the
unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 were explored through multivariable
analyses and reported as odds ratios (ORs). Among 662 papers initially screened, 
we included 15 studies for a total of 9753 older adults. The prevalence of
unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in older people was 27.03% (95%CI:
15.10-38.95%), whilst the correspondent figure of uncertainty was 19.33% (95%CI: 
12.28-26.39). The risk of being unvaccinated was significantly higher in
Hispanics (OR=1.197; 95%CI: 1.010-1.418) and in case of low education (OR=1.678; 
95%CI: 1.170-2.408) and low income (OR=1.287; 95%CI: 1.127-1.469). In conclusion,
the hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccination is a relevant problem in older people,
particularly in those with a low income, a low level of education, and in
Hispanics living in the United States.
