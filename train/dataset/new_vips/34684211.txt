Reinfection cases have been reported in some countries with clinical symptoms
ranging from mild to severe. In addition to clinical diagnosis, virus genome
sequence from the first and second infection has to be confirmed to either belong
to separate clades or had significant mutations for the confirmation of
SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. While phylogenetic analysis with paired specimens offers 
the strongest evidence for reinfection, there remains concerns on the definition 
of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, for reasons including accessibility to paired-samples 
and technical challenges in phylogenetic analysis. In light of the emergence of
new SARS-CoV-2 variants that are associated with increased transmissibility and
immune-escape further understanding of COVID-19 protective immunity, real-time
surveillance directed at identifying COVID-19 transmission patterns,
transmissibility of emerging variants and clinical implications of reinfection
would be important in addressing the challenges in definition of COVID-19
reinfection and understanding the true disease burden.
