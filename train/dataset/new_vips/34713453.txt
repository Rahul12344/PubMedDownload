BACKGROUND: Fast-spreading diseases affecting wildlife populations threaten
biodiversity. Two caliciviruses, Lagovirus europaeus/GI.1 and Lagovirus
europaeus/GI.2, caused rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in wild rabbits. 
Despite having different characteristics, these variants spread quickly, posing a
threat to wild rabbit populations.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted a thorough review of the scientific
literature and reports of international organisations of first detections of both
variants of RHDV in the Euro-Mediterranean region. We concentrated on this area
to avoid bias due to intentional human introductions.
RESULTS: The estimated mean spread rate of GI.2 was higher than that of GI.1
(GI.2: 479 km/year, range: 47-7346; GI.1: 330 km/year, 37-6248). These
differences were not statistically significant. This lack of difference may be
due to the interactions between each variant's virulence characteristics. Humans 
may have a dominant effect on their spread. Potential limitations associated with
the observational process could have hindered our ability to identify statistical
differences.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of difference in the spread patterns of the two variants
could be due to a biological cause, human facilitation or a lack of statistical
power. Adapting protocols to detect diseases in wildlife using homogeneous
criteria will be indispensable in the coming years.
