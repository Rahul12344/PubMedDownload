Background: Timely testing is a key determinant of management outcomes of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction tests are currently the mainstay for COVID-19 testing. However,
serological point-of-care tests (PoCTs) can be useful in identifying asymptomatic
and recovered cases, as well as herd immunity.
Objective: The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 PoCTs in Kenya to support
the emergency use authorisation of these tests.
Methods: Between March 2020 and May 2020, 18 firms, of which 13 were from China, 
submitted their PoCTs to the national regulatory authority, the Pharmacy and
Poison Board, who in turn forwarded them to the Kenya Medical Research Institute 
for pre-evaluation assessment. The tests were run with real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction COVID-19-positive samples. Pre-COVID-19
plasma samples that were collected in June 2019 were used as negative samples.
The shelf lives of the PoCTs ranged from 6 to 24 months.
Results: Only nine (50%) tests had sensitivities ≥ 40% (range: 40% - 60%) and the
ability of these tests to detect IgM ranged from 0% to 50%. Many (7/18; 38.9%) of
the kits had very weak IgM and IgG band intensities (range: 2-3).
Conclusion: Serological-based PoCTs available in Kenya can only detect COVID-19
in up to 60% of the infected population.
