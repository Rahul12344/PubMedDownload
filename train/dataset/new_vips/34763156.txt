BACKGROUND: To determine and compare nasopharyngeal microbiota (NM) composition, 
in vitro basal (Nil tube), provoked (Mitogen tube) production of cytokines at the
early stage of COVID-19.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 4 age and sex-matched study groups; 
group 1 (recovered COVID-19) (n = 26), group 2 (mild COVID-19) (n = 24), group 3 
(severe COVID-19) (n = 25), and group 4 (healthy controls) (n = 25). The study
parameters obtained from the COVID-19 (group 2, and 3) at the early phase of
hospital admission.
RESULTS: The results from the reaserch deoicted that the Mean ± SD age was
53.09 ± 14.51 years. Some of the in vitro cytokines production was significantly 
different between the study groups. Some of the findinggs on cytokines depicted a
significant differences between study groups were interleukin (IL)-1β Nil, IL-1β 
Mitogen, and their subtraction (i.e Mitogen-Nil). Regarding IL-10, and IL-17a
levels, Mitogen, and Mitogen-Nil tube production levels were significantly
different between the groups. Surprisingly, most of these measures were lowest in
the severe COVID-19 patients' group. Using discriminant analysis effect size
(LEfSe), Taxa of NM with significant abundance was determined. About 20 taxa with
an LDA score > 4 were identified as candidate biomarkers. Some of these taxa
showed a significant correlation with IL-1β and IL-10 Mitogen and Mitogen- Nil
levels (R > 0.3 or < -0.3, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this perticular study regarting the early stage of
COVID-19 showed that in vitro cytokines production, studies might be more useful 
than the ordinary cytokines' blood level measurement. Besides, the study
identified some NM species that could be candidate biomarkers in managing this
infection. However, further detailed studies are needed in these fields.
