The COVID-19 pandemic has driven home the serious vulnerabilities plaguing
Canada's long-term care system. We argue for significant new federal investments 
tied to clear, enforceable quality standards (particularly around staffing); new 
investments in home care so that more people can "age in place"; and additional
support for informal care providers, including respite programs and cash
benefits. We explore how to achieve these reforms within the framework of
Canadian federalism and call for the creation of a national governance framework 
- overseen by experts independent of federal and provincial governments - tasked 
with establishing evidence-based standards for the quality, safety and timeliness
of long-term care services.
