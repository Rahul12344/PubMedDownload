Lasting disinfection effects, that is, the residual disinfection effects (RDEs), 
of skin-coated disinfectants have rarely been considered for infection control
owing to the challenges involved in the accurate evaluation of RDEs. In this
study, we constructed a new skin evaluation model and determined the RDEs of
existing disinfectants against viruses. Our results showed that ethanol and
isopropanol had no RDE, whereas povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate, and
benzalkonium chloride (BAC) exhibited RDEs, with 10% povidone-iodine and 0.2% BAC
showing particularly strong RDEs. The RDE of 0.2% BAC was strong enough to reduce
the median survival times of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,
human coronavirus-OC43, and influenza virus from 670 to 5.2, 1300 to 12, and 120 
to 4.2 min, respectively. Additionally, this strong RDE was maintained even 4 h
after coating the skin. Clinical data also showed that the strong RDE of 0.2% BAC
was maintained for more than 2 h. Thus, applying disinfectants with strong RDEs
on the skin correlates with a reduction in virus survival time and appears to
create a skin surface environment that is not conducive to virus survival. A
prolonged reduction in virus survival decreases the contact transmission risk,
thereby enabling stronger infection control.
