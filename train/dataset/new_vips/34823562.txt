BACKGROUND: Considering the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by
SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments. At present, 
neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule drugs such as remdesivir, the most
promising compound to treat this infection, have attracted considerable
attention. However, some potential problems need to be concerned including viral 
resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization caused by selective pressure from 
a single antibody treatment, the unexpected antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 
effect, and the toxic effect of small-molecule drugs.
RESULTS: Here, we constructed a type of programmed nanovesicle (NV) derived from 
bispecific CAR-T cells that express two single-chain fragment variables (scFv),
named CR3022 and B38, to target SARS-CoV-2. Nanovesicles that express both CR3022
and B38 (CR3022/B38 NVs) have a stronger ability to neutralize Spike-pseudovirus 
infectivity than nanovesicles that express either CR3022 or B38 alone. Notably,
the co-expression of CR3022 and B38, which target different epitopes of spike
protein, could reduce the incidence of viral resistance. Moreover, the lack of Fc
fragments on the surface of CR3022/B38 NVs could prevent ADE effects.
Furthermore, the specific binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the
drug loading capacity of CR3022/B38 NVs can facilitate targeted delivery of
remdesiver to 293 T cells overexpressing spike protein. These results suggest
that CR3022/B38 NVs have the potential ability to target antiviral drugs to the
main site of viral infection, thereby enhancing the antiviral ability by
inhibiting intracellular viral replication and reducing adverse drug reactions.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate that nanovesicles derived from CAR-T
cells targeting the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 have the ability to neutralize
Spike-pseudotyped virus and target antiviral drugs. This novel therapeutic
approach may help to solve the dilemma faced by neutralizing antibodies and
small-molecule drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.
