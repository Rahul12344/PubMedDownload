BACKGROUND: Migrants are not routinely screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV),
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the
Netherlands. We estimated the prevalence and determined factors associated with
HBV, HCV and/or HIV infections among undocumented migrants and uninsured legal
residents.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, undocumented migrants and uninsured legal
residents were recruited at a non governmental organization (NGO), healthcare
facility in the Netherlands and were invited to be tested for hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBcAb), HCV-RNA, and
anti-HIV antibodies or HIV antigen at a local laboratory.
RESULTS: Of the 1376 patients invited, 784 (57%) participated. Participants
originated from Africa (35%), Asia (30%) and North/South America (30%). 451/784
(58%) participants went to the laboratory for testing. Of participants 30% were
HBV exposed (anti-HBcAb-positive), with 27% (n = 119/438, 95% CI 23.1% to 31.6%) 
having resolved HBV infection (HBsAg-negative) and 2.5% (n = 11/438, 95%CI 1.3%
to 4.5%, 64% new infection) having chronic HBV infection (HBsAg-positive).
Compared to HBV non-exposed, HBV exposed individuals were older (p = 0.034) and
more often originated from Africa (p<0.001). Prevalence of chronic HCV infection 
(HCV-RNA-positive) was 0.7% (n = 3/435, 95%CI 0.1% to 2.0%, all new infections)
and HIV infection 1.1% (n = 5/439, 95%CI 0.04% to 2.6%, 40% new infection).
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of chronic HBV, chronic HCV and HIV infections in our
study population is higher compared to the Dutch population, thus emphasizing the
importance of case finding for these infections through primary care and public
health in this specific group of migrants. Screening uptake could be improved by 
on-site testing.
