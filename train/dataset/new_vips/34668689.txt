OBJECTIVES: To compare consultations at the Otorhinolaryngological Department at 
a tertiary referral centre between the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 and the same
period in 2019, as well as to study the impact of deferring visits on disease
progression.
METHODS: The emergency consultations during these time periods were analysed
retrospectively. The effect of postponing appointments on disease progression was
examined for 122 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, for 50 patients with a
benign tumour and for 22 patients with the diagnosis of a malignant tumour. To
compare disease progression, patients with the diagnosis of a malignant tumour
were matched to patients seen over the same period in 2019.
RESULTS: During the lockdown, a reduction of 44.1% in emergency consultations
compared with 2019 was observed. The largest significant decrease of consultation
numbers was seen for otitis media and for Eustachian tube dysfunction. Fewer
patients with tonsillitis sought emergency assistance; however, no difference in 
frequency of abscesses was observed. Disease progression was seen in 44.4% of
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. In 2020, 18.8% of patients with the
diagnosis of a malignant tumour showed disease progression, yet no difference
from the previous year was observed.
CONCLUSION: Fewer emergency consultations took place during the COVID-19
lockdown; among others, there were fewer visits due to otitis media and
tonsillitis. However, no change in the incidence of complications was noted.
Almost 50% of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis showed disease progression,
leading to prolonged suffering due to the rescheduling of appointments. The
treatment of patients with the diagnosis of a malignant tumour was not affected
by the postponement of consultations.
