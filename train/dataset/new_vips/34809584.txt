BACKGROUND: Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS),
a widely used functional genomics tool, requires growth temperatures typically
lower than those of the plant's native environment. Enabling VIGS under native
conditions in the field according to applicable safety regulations could be a
revolutionary advance for ecological research.
RESULTS: Here, we report the development of an enhanced thermal tolerant VIGS
vector system based on a TRV California isolate. cDNA clones representing the
whole viral genome were sequenced and used to construct separate binary plant
transformation vectors for functional elements of RNA1 (6765 nt) and RNA2
(3682 nt). VIGS of target genes was induced by transient transformation of the
host plant with both vectors or by treating the host plant with sap from already 
VIGS induced plants. In Nicotiana attenuata the silencing efficiency of the PDS
(phytoene desaturase) gene was 90% at 28 °C and 78% at 30 °C. Silencing at these 
temperatures was more prominent and durable than silencing induced by the widely 
used TRV PpK20-based pBINTRA6/pTV00 system, but was associated with a viral
phenotype. Differences in the suppressor protein and RNA dependent RNA polymerase
sequences between the TRV California isolate and PpK20 may be the reason for
their different thermal tolerance.
CONCLUSIONS: The new TRV California-based VIGS vectors induce gene silencing in
Nicotiana attenuata at higher temperatures than the existing pBINTRA6/pTV00
vector system, but cause greater growth defects. The new vector system opens up
an avenue to study genes functions in planta under field conditions.
