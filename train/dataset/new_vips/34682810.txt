The aim of the study is to report on the indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and
OCT findings in patients hospitalized for severe COVID infection. In this
observational prospective monocentric cohort study, we included patients
hospitalized for severe COVID infection. The main outcomes were ICGA and OCT
findings. A total of 14 patients with a mean age of 58.2 ± 11.4 years and a male 
predominance (9/14 patients; 64%) were included. The main ICGA findings included 
hypofluorescent spots in 19 eyes (68%), intervortex shunts in 10 eyes (36%), and 
characteristic "hemangioma-like" lesions in five eyes (18%). "Hemangioma-like"
lesions were both unique and unilateral, and showed no washout on the late phase 
of the angiogram. The main OCT findings included focal choroidal thickening in
seven eyes (25%), caverns in six eyes (21%) and paracentral acute middle
maculopathy lesions in one eye (4%). All patients hospitalized for severe COVID
infection had anomalies on ICGA and OCT. Lesions to both retinal and choroidal
vasculature were found. These anomalies could be secondary to vascular
involvement related directly or indirectly to the SARS-CoV2 virus.
