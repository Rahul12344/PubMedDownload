We developed an intranasal vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the replication-incompetent human parainfluenza 
virus type 2 (hPIV2) vector BC-PIV, which can deliver ectopic gene as stable RNA 
and ectopic protein on the envelope. BC-PIV expressing the full-length
prefusion-stabilized spike gene (K986P/V987P) of SARS-CoV-2, S-2PM, possessed a
corona-like viral envelope. Intranasal vaccination of mice with BC-PIV/S-2PM
induced high levels of neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA
antibodies against the spike protein. Although BC-PIV showed hemagglutinating
activity, BC-PIV/S-2PM lacked such activity, in accordance with the presence of
the massive spike protein on the viral surface. Furthermore, single-dose
intranasal vaccination of hamsters with BC-PIV/S-2PM completely protected the
lungs from SARS-CoV-2 at 11-week post-immunization, and boost vaccination two
weeks before the challenge conferred virtually complete protection of the nasal
turbinates against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this chimeric hPIV2/spike intranasal vaccine
is a promising vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 to curtail virus transmission.
