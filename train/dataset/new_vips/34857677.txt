The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged around December 2019 claimed millions of
lives. For vaccine development, S protein on viral envelope that binds to ACE2
receptor on cells for entry was identified as vaccine candidate. S protein
consists of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in the S1 subunit followed by the S2
subunit with an intermediate furin cleavage site. A stabilized version of S
protein with 2 proline residues was used as antigen. Overall, most vaccines
exhibited efficacy between 80 and 95%. However, being a RNA virus that is prone
to mutations along with selection pressure on S protein and frequent use of
convalescent plasma led to evolution of variants. These variants are responsible 
for multiple waves of infection observed globally. In our review, we discuss
current data on vaccines and its efficacy in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan
and its variants. Further, our docked mutations observed in variants on the
ACE2-S complex cryo-EM structure show that mostly the S1 domain is under
selection pressure where major mutations occur in the N terminal domain (NTD),
RBM and junction near S1-S2 subunit. Therefore, this review would be a reference 
for development of new candidate antigen(s) with better efficacy against
variants.
