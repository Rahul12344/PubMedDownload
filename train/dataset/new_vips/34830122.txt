Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), as a typical seed-borne virus, causes
costly and devastating diseases in the vegetable trade worldwide. Genetic sources
for resistance to CGMMV in cucurbits are limited, and environmentally safe
approaches for curbing the accumulation and spread of seed-transmitted viruses
and cultivating completely resistant plants are needed. Here, we describe the
design and application of RNA interference-based technologies, containing
artificial microRNA (amiRNA) and synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNA
(syn-tasiRNA), against conserved regions of different strains of the CGMMV
genome. We used a rapid transient sensor system to identify effective anti-CGMMV 
amiRNAs. A virus seed transmission assay was developed, showing that the
externally added polycistronic amiRNA and syn-tasiRNA can successfully block the 
accumulation of CGMMV in cucumber, but different virulent strains exhibited
distinct influences on the expression of amiRNA due to the activity of the
RNA-silencing suppressor. We also established stable transgenic cucumber plants
expressing polycistronic amiRNA, which conferred disease resistance against
CGMMV, and no sequence mutation was observed in CGMMV. This study demonstrates
that RNA interference-based technologies can effectively prevent the occurrence
and accumulation of CGMMV. The results provide a basis to establish and fine-tune
approaches to prevent and treat seed-based transmission viral infections.
