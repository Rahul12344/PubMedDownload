This report from ASCO's International Quality Steering Group summarizes early
learnings on how the COVID-19 pandemic and its stresses have disproportionately
affected cancer care delivery and its delivery systems across the world. This
article shares perspectives from eight different countries, including Austria,
Brazil, Ghana, Honduras, Ireland, the Philippines, South Africa, and the United
Arab Emirates, which provide insight to their unique issues, challenges, and
barriers to quality improvement in cancer care during the pandemic. These
perspectives shed light on some key recommendations applicable on a global scale 
and focus on access to care, importance of expanding and developing new
treatments for both COVID-19 and cancer, access to telemedicine, collecting and
using COVID-19 and cancer registry data, establishing measures and guidelines to 
further enhance quality of care, and expanding communication among governments,
health care systems, and health care providers. The impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on cancer care and quality improvement has been and will continue to be 
felt across the globe, but this report aims to share these experiences and
learnings and to assist ASCO's international members and our global fight against
the pandemic and cancer.
