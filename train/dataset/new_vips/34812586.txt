Forsyqinlingines C ( 1 ) and D ( 2 ), two C 9 -monoterpenoid alkaloids bearing a 
rare skeleton, were isolated from the ripe fruits of Forsythia suspensa . Their
structures, including absolute configurations, were fully elucidated by extensive
spectroscopic data and ECD experiments. The plausible biogenetic pathway for
compounds 1 and 2 was also proposed. In vitro , two C 9 -monoterpenoid alkaloids 
showed anti-inflammatory activity performed by the inhibitory effect on the
release of β -glucuronidase in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), as well
as anti-viral activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus and respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV).
