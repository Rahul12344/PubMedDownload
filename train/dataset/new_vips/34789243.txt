BACKGROUND: 2019-nCoV has been spreading around the world and becoming a global
concern. To prevent further widespread of 2019-nCoV, confirmed and suspected
cases of COVID-19 infection are suggested to be kept in quarantine. However, the 
diagnose of COVID-19 infection is quite time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
alleviate the burden on the medical staff, we have done some research on the
intelligent diagnosis of COVID-19.
METHODS: In this paper, we constructed a COVID-19 Diagnosis Ontology (CDO) by
utilizing Protégé, which includes the basic knowledge graph of COVID-19 as well
as diagnostic rules translated from Chinese government documents. Besides, SWRL
rules were added into the ontology to infer intimate relationships between
people, thus facilitating the efficient diagnosis of the suspected cases of
COVID-19 infection. We downloaded real-case data and extracted patients'
syndromes from the descriptive text, so as to verify the accuracy of this
experiment.
RESULTS: After importing those real instances into Protégé, we demonstrated that 
the COVID-19 Diagnosis Ontology showed good performances to diagnose cases of
COVID-19 infection automatically.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the COVID-19 Diagnosis Ontology will not only
significantly reduce the manual input in the diagnosis process of COVID-19, but
also uncover hidden cases and help prevent the widespread of this epidemic.
