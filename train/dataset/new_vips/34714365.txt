Canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) is ubiquitously distributed in dog population
worldwide causing a severe and often fatal gastroenteritis. Owing to its highly
contagious nature, rapid detection of CPV is crucial in effective control of the 
disease. Aptamers have emerged as potential alternative to antibodies as affinity
reagents in diagnostic field. Present study was aimed to select and validate
ssDNA aptamers specific to CPV. Systematic evolution of ligands through
exponential enrichment (SELEX) method was employed for selection of CPV
structural protein (VP2) specific DNA aptamers. SELEX was performed using a pool 
of ssDNA library comprising 30 random nucleotide region. A total of seven rounds 
of SELEX were performed using VP2 protein as target antigen which yielded ten
aptamers (1A-10A) with distinct sequences. Target binding of all ten aptamers was
assessed by dot blot and enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) which
revealed that 5A, 6A, 9A, and 10A were superior binders. In silico analysis of
the aptamers revealed the existence of binding site on VP2 protein, and binding
pattern was similar to in vitro findings. The affinity (KD) of all these four
binders against CPV was evaluated by ELONA indicating relatively higher affinity 
of 6A and 10A than remaining two DNA sequences. Out of which, aptamer 6A
displayed cross-reactivity with canine distemper virus and canine corona virus.
Hence, aptamer 10A was considered as better binding sequence having high
specificity and affinity for CPV. The study confirms the future utility of
selected aptamers in development of a reliable diagnostic for rapid detection of 
CPV. KEY POINTS: • Canine parvovirus-specific ssDNA aptamers were identified with
nanomolar affinity (100-150 nM). • Three aptamers displayed negligible
cross-reactivity with other related viruses. • Aptamer 10A displayed high binding
affinity and specificity to CPV.
