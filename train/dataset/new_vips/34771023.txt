Zinc is the second most abundant trace element in the human body, and it plays a 
fundamental role in human physiology, being an integral component of hundreds of 
enzymes and transcription factors. The discovery that zinc atoms may compete with
copper for their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract let to introduce zinc
in the therapy of Wilson's disease, a congenital disorder of copper metabolism
characterized by a systemic copper storage. Nowadays, zinc salts are considered
one of the best therapeutic approach in patients affected by Wilson's disease. On
the basis of the similarities, at histological level, between Wilson's disease
and non-alcoholic liver disease, zinc has been successfully introduced in the
therapy of non-alcoholic liver disease, with positive effects both on insulin
resistance and oxidative stress. Recently, zinc deficiency has been indicated as 
a possible factor responsible for the susceptibility of elderly patients to
undergo infection by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19
pandemic. Here, we present the data correlating zinc deficiency with the
insurgence and progression of Covid-19 with low zinc levels associated with
severe disease states. Finally, the relevance of zinc supplementation in aged
people at risk for SARS-CoV-2 is underlined, with the aim that the zinc-based
drug, classically used in the treatment of copper overload, might be recorded as 
one of the tools reducing the mortality of COVID-19, particularly in elderly
people.
