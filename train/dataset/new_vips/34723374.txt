The failure to learn lessons from crises is a common observation. The UK
Government has been criticized for its response to the COVID-19 crisis. Many
critics have highlighted the Government's apparent failure to learn the lessons
from Exercise Cygnus, which made recommendations to improve the UK's response to 
a pandemic. This article compares and contrasts the UK Government's response with
the exercise recommendations. It critiques the gaps using current crisis
management literature and argues that to avoid future failings, more emphasis is 
needed on the effectiveness of recommendations from exercises. If this is not
done, exercise lessons identified, and their recommendations will not be
operationalized. This article argues that the successful transition from policy
recommendation to practice requires recommendations to be contextualized, so they
are feasible and practical, before they can be institutionalized. It introduces a
practical framework and organizational actions on how future exercises can close 
the gap from lessons identified to be learned and shape practice.
