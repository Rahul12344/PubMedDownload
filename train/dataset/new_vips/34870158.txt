The outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized in December 2019 in China and as of
October5th, the pandemic was swept through 216 countries and infected around
34,824,108 individuals, thus posing an unprecedented threat to world's health and
economy. Several researchers reported that, a significant mutation in membrane
proteins and receptor binding sites of preceding severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to turned as novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and disease
was named as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). Unfortunately, there is no
specific treatment available for COVID-19 patients. The lessons learned from the 
past management of SARS-CoV and other pandemics, have provided some insights to
treat COVID-19. Currently, therapies like anti-viral treatment, immunomodulatory 
agents, plasma transfusion and supportive intervention etc., are using to treat
the COVID-19. Few of these were proven to provide significant therapeutic
benefits in treating the COVID-19, however no drug is approved by the regulatory 
agencies. As the fatality rate is high in patients with comorbid conditions, we
have also enlightened the current in-line treatment therapies and specific
treatment strategies in comorbid conditions to combat the emergence of COVID-19. 
In addition, pharmaceutical, biological companies and research institutions
across the globe have begun to develop thesafe and effective vaccine for
COVID-19. Globally around 170 teams of researchers are racing to develop the
COVID-19 vaccine and here we have discussed about their current status of
development. Furthermore, recent patents filed in association with COVID-19 was
elaborated. This can help many individuals, researchers or health workers, in
applying these principles for diagnosis/prevention/management/treatment of the
current pandemic.
