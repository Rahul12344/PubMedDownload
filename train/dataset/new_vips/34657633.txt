The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in the world from last year, and any
further insults like Zika virus will surely bring the apocalypse unto us. In July
2021, Zika began spreading in India, mainly in the state of Kerala. Zika
infection resembles closely COVID-19 and other arboviral infections, which might 
lead to delayed and misdiagnosis, further leading to underreporting of cases.
Some of the feared complications of Zika include Guillain-Barré syndrome and
congenital Zika syndrome leading to microcephaly. Thus, Zika virus disease (ZVD) 
has significant public health and social impacts. Since the trifecta of
infectious diseases (host, agent and environment) are all conducive to the spread
of Zika in India, there is a huge risk that ZVD might become endemic in India,
which is especially dangerous in the backdrop of this pandemic. This has to be
stopped at all costs: the main aspects of which are public health measures,
vector control and early diagnosis, especially in case of pregnant women. The
diversion of healthcare resources for this pandemic has albeit made this
difficult, but we must do our bit if we have to overcome this situation.
