The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused tremendous healthcare burden worldwide. Our focus
was to develop a practical and easy to deploy system to predict the severe
manifestation of disease in COVID-19 patients with an aim to assist clinicians in
triage and treatment decisions. Our proposed predictive algorithm is a trained
artificial intelligence-based network using 8,427 COVID-19 patient records from
four healthcare systems. The model provides a severity risk score along with
likelihoods of various clinical outcomes, namely ventilator use and mortality.
The trained model using patient age and nine laboratory markers has the
prediction accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·78 95% CI: 0·77-0·82,
and the negative predictive value NPV of 0·86 95% CI: 0·84-0·88 for the need to
use a ventilator and has an accuracy with AUC of 0·85 95% CI: 0·84-0·86, and the 
NPV of 0·94 95% CI: 0·92-0·96 for predicting in-hospital 30-day mortality.
