Africa has a high burden of tuberculosis, which is the most important risk factor
for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). Our goal was to systematically
evaluate the burden of CPA in Africa and map it by country. We conducted an
extensive literature search for publications on CPA in Africa using the online
databases. We reviewed a total of 41 studies published between 1976 and 2021,
including a total of 1247 CPA cases from 14 African countries. Most of the cases 
came from Morocco (n = 764, 62.3%), followed by South Africa (n = 122, 9.9%) and 
Senegal (n = 99, 8.1%). Seventeen (41.5%) studies were retrospective, 12 (29.3%) 
were case reports, 5 case series (12.2%), 5 prospective cohorts, and 2
cross-sectional studies. The majority of the cases (67.1%, n = 645) were
diagnosed in men, with a median age of 41 years (interquartile range: 36-45).
Active/previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 764, 61.3%), human
immunodeficiency virus infection (n = 29, 2.3%), diabetes mellitus (n = 19,
1.5%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 10, 0.8%) were the common
co-morbidities. Haemoptysis was the most frequent presenting symptom, reported in
up to 717 (57%) cases. Smoking (n = 69, 5.5%), recurrent lung infections (n = 41,
3%) and bronchorrhea (n = 33, 3%) were noted. This study confirms that CPA is
common in Africa, with pulmonary tuberculosis being the most important risk
factor.
