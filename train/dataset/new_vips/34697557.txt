Modeling antigenic variation in influenza (flu) virus A H3N2 using amino acid
sequences is a promising approach for improving the prediction accuracy of immune
efficacy of vaccines and increasing the efficiency of vaccine screening.
Antigenic drift and antigenic jump/shift, which arise from the accumulation of
mutations with small or moderate effects and from a major, abrupt change with
large effects on the surface antigen hemagglutinin (HA), respectively, are two
types of antigenic variation that facilitate immune evasion of flu virus A and
make it challenging to predict the antigenic properties of new viral strains.
Despite considerable progress in modeling antigenic variation based on the amino 
acid sequences, few studies focus on the deep learning framework which could be
most suitable to be applied to this task. Here, we propose a novel deep learning 
approach that incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional
long-short-term memory (BLSTM) neural network to predict antigenic variation. In 
this approach, CNN extracts the complex local contexts of amino acids while the
BLSTM neural network captures the long-distance sequence information. When
compared to the existing methods, our deep learning approach achieves the overall
highest prediction performance on the validation dataset, and more encouragingly,
it achieves prediction agreements of 99.20% and 96.46% for the strains in the
forthcoming year and in the next two years included in an existing set of
chronological amino acid sequences, respectively. These results indicate that our
deep learning approach is promising to be applied to antigenic variation
prediction of flu virus A H3N2.
