Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus with a complex life cycle that includes a 
reverse transcription step. HBV is poorly sensed by the immune system and
frequently establishes persistent infection that can cause chronic infection, the
leading cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis worldwide. Recent mounting evidence
has indicated the growing importance of RNA methylation (m6A modification) in
viral replication, immune escape, and carcinogenesis. The value of m6A RNA
modification for the prediction and clinical management of chronic HBV infection 
remains to be assessed. However, a number of studies indicate the important role 
of m6A-marked transcripts and factors of m6A machinery in managing HBV-related
pathologies. In this review, we discuss the fundamental and potential clinical
impact of m6A modifications on HBV infection and pathogenesis, as well as
highlight the important molecular techniques and tools that can be used for
studying RNA m6A methylome.
