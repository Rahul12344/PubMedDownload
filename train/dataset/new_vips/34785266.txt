BACKGROUND: Although influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality 
worldwide, the impact of these infections on children in France and in other
European countries has not been extensively characterized. The primary objective 
of the present study was to describe the burden of influenza disease on
hospitalized children under 2 years of age in France, using data from the
national hospital discharge summary database (Programme de Médicalisation des
Systèmes d'Information, PMSI).
METHODS: In a retrospective study of hospital admissions for influenza among
children under the age of 2 in France, we extracted and analyzed hospital
administrative data from the PMSI database (from January 1, 2011, to December 31,
2020).
RESULTS: From 2011 to 2020, 28,507 children under the age of 2 were admitted to
hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of influenza infection. The
hospital admission rate was 205 per 100,000 for children under the age of 2, 276 
per 100,000 for children under the age of 12 months, and 135 per 100,000 for
children aged between 12 and 23 months. Children under 6 months of age were the
most affected (45.4%). An underlying condition was identified for 9.4% of the
children, and 2.2% of the children were admitted to the intensive care unit. The 
death rate was 0.12 per 100,000 for children under 2, 0.11 per 100,000 for
children under 12 months, and 0.16 per 100,000 for children aged between 12 and
23 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In France, the burden of influenza disease is significant in
children under the age of 2.
