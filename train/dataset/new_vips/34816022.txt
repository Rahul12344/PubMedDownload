Purpose: Brachytherapy (BT) boost after radio-chemotherapy (RCT) is a standard of
care in the management of locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). As there is no
consensus on high-dose-rate (HDR) BT fractionation schemes, our aim was to report
the oncological outcome and toxicity profile of four different schemes using
twice-a-day (BID) HDR-BT.
Patients and methods: This was an observational, retrospective, single
institution study for patients with LACC receiving a HDR-BT boost. The latter was
performed with a single implant and single imaging done on day 1. The different
fractionation schemes were: 7 Gy + 4x3.5 Gy (group 1); 7 Gy + 4x4.5 Gy (group 2);
3x7Gy (group 3) and 3x8Gy (group 4). Local (LFS), nodal (NFS) and metastatic
(MFS) recurrence-free survival as well as progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Acute (≤6 months) and late toxicities (>6
months) were reported.
Results: From 2007 to 2018, 191 patients were included. Median follow-up was
57 months [45-132] and median EQD210D90CTVHR was 84, 82 and 90 Gy for groups 2, 3
and 4 respectively (dosimetric data missing for group 1). The 5-year LFS, NFS,
MFS, PFS and OS were 85% [81-90], 83% [79-86], 70% [67-73], 61% [57-64] and 75%
[69-78] respectively, with no significant difference between the groups.
EQD210D90CTVHR < 85 Gy was a prognostic factor for local recurrence in univariate
analysis (p = 0.045). The rates of acute/late grade ≥ 2 urinary, digestive and
gynecological toxicities were 9%/15%, 3%/15% and 9%/25% respectively.
Conclusion: Bi-fractionated HDR-BT boost seems feasible with good oncological
outcome and slightly more toxicity after dose escalation.
