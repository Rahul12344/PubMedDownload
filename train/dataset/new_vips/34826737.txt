Generation of two human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) with
mutations of the α-synuclein (SNCA) gene associated with Parkinson's disease; the
A53T mutation (LCSBi003) and a triplication of the SNCA gene (LCSBi007).

Mutations in the SNCA (α-synuclein, PARK1) gene significantly contribute to
Parkinson's disease and SNCA inclusions are strongly associated with PD.
Fibroblasts from a 51-year-old female patient with disease onset at 39 years,
carrying the A53T SNCA mutation (LCSBi003, ND40996), and fibroblasts with a
triplication of the SNCA gene obtained from a 55-year-old female patient with
disease onset at 52 years (LCSBi007, ND27760), were reprogrammed into human
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using Sendai virus. The presence of other 
genetic variants was determined using array comparative genomic hybridization.
Presence of SNCA triplication was confirmed by FISH analysis.
