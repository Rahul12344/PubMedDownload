BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase 2J2 (CYP2J2) metabolizes arachidonic acid
to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which exert anti-inflammatory,
anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative, and antioxidant effects on the cardiovascular 
system. However, the role of CYP2J2 and EETs in pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH) with lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) remains unclear. In the
present study, we investigated the effects of CYP2J2 overexpression and exogenous
EETs on PAH with LIRI in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: CYP2J2 gene was transfected into rat lung tissue by recombinant
adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to increase the levels of EETs in serum and lung
tissue. A rat model of PAH with LIRI was constructed by intraperitoneal injection
of monocrotaline (50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, followed by clamping of the left
pulmonary hilum for 1 h and reperfusion for 2 h. In addition, we established a
cellular model of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) with TNF-α
combined with anoxia/reoxygenation (anoxia for 8 h and reoxygenation for 16 h) to
determine the effect and mechanism of exogenous EETs.
RESULTS: CYP2J2 overexpression significantly reduced the inflammatory response,
oxidative stress and apoptosis associated with lung injury in PAH with LIRI. In
addition, exogenous EETs suppressed inflammatory response and reduced
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inhibited apoptosis in
a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) combined hypoxia-reoxygenation model of
HPAECs. Our further studies revealed that the anti-inflammatory effects of CYP2J2
overexpression and EETs might be mediated by the activation of PPARγ; the
anti-apoptotic effects might be mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP2J2 overexpression and EETs protect against PAH with LIRI via
anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, suggesting that
increased levels of EETs may be a promising strategy for the prevention and
treatment of PAH with LIRI.
