Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) has a known negative effect on the
community's health; therefore, assessment to monitor community health is
essential to detect any issues and enable early treatment. Because ASGM-related
health issues are complex and cannot be addressed effectively with a traditional 
one-time health assessment alone, both long-term and regular health assessments
using a transdisciplinary approach should be considered. In response to this
need, we designed an online health assessment tool as a reference for a future
long-term health assessment system. An online video interview was conducted with 
54 respondents living in the ASGM area of Chaung Gyi Village, Thabeikkyin
Township, Mandalay Region, Myanmar, via a social networking service application. 
The tool was used to evaluate community health during the coronavirus 2019
pandemic, including mercury intoxication symptoms, mining-related diseases, and
other diseases. Results show that persons working in mining versus non-mining
occupations had a greater prevalence of pulmonary diseases, such as pulmonary
tuberculosis, silicosis, and bronchial asthma, in addition to malaria. Based on
these findings, online health assessment using a transdisciplinary approach can
be recommended as an effective tool for sustainable and long-term health
assessment of ASGM-related disease and should be performed regularly following
physical health surveys.
