As a part of the efforts to quickly develop pharmaceutical treatments for
COVID-19 through repurposing existing drugs, some researchers around the world
have combined the recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in
complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor with virtual screening procedures
employing molecular docking approaches. In this context, protease inhibitors
(PIs) clinically available and currently used to treat infectious diseases,
particularly viral ones, are relevant sources of promising drug candidates to
inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, a key viral enzyme involved in crucial events during
its life cycle. In the present perspective, we summarized the published studies
showing the promising use of HIV and HCV PIs as potential repurposing drugs
against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
