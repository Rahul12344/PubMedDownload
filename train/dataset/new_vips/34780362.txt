INTRODUCTION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
affects mainly the lungs causing pneumonia and complications like acute
respiratory distress syndrome. Pneumothorax is a rare manifestation of the
disease. This report is a description of a series of patients with COVID-19 and
spontaneous pneumothorax, some of them with associated pulmonary cysts.
METHODOLOGY: Cases were collected retrospectively. We included clinical data from
medical records and described radiologic findings. Patients that developed
pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation were excluded.
RESULTS: Ten cases were included in this report, nine of them were male. The
median age of our series was 62 years (IQR = 57-68). The median days since the
onset of symptoms until the development of pneumothorax was 27 (IQR = 17-31),
most cases developed after the second week of the diagnosis of pneumonia. Two
cases required invasive mechanical ventilation, but pneumothorax occurred after
ventilator weaning. Three cases showed subpleural pulmonary cysts.
CONCLUSIONS: Cysts and pneumothorax are rare manifestations of SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia with mechanisms not completely understood. This report highlights the
role of CT scan in diagnosis of COVID-19 complications.
