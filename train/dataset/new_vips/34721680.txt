There is still controversy about quantitatively evaluating the therapeutic effect
of radioactive low-activity iodine-125 seeds (125I seeds). In the present study, 
a paired VX2 tumor model in a rabbit hind leg muscle was established, which is
virus-induced anaplastic squamous cell carcinoma characterized by
hypervascularity, rapid growth and easy propagation in the skeletal muscle. 125I 
seeds with 0.4 and 0.7 mCi activity were implanted into the left and right legs, 
respectively, using a radiation treatment planning system under positron emission
tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) guidance. PET/CT scans and hematoxylin 
and eosin staining were observed at 72 h and 2 and 4 weeks after implantation to 
assess the therapeutic effect. The results showed that the average tumor length
and standard uptake value (SUV) decreased over time, and both 125I seed groups
achieved therapeutic effects at 4 weeks post-implantation. Quantitative
evaluation of tumor inhibition rate, SUV variation and tumor marker ratio
(Bcl-2/Bax) suggested that 0.7 mCi 125I seeds were more suitable than 0.4 mCi
seeds in a clinical setting.
