Weather factors are effective to transmission of various diseases. Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and kinds 
of influenza can be given as example these diseases. The novel corona virus which
is called COVID-19 is the most dangerous problem all around the world in these
days. Early studies have revealed that COVID-19 cases are affected by
environmental factors. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the
relationship between the number of novel coronavirus cases and several weather
parameters in 81 provinces of Turkey. Mean incubation period of COVID-19 is in
question. Thus, this paper also aims to provide better understanding of the exact
incubation period in Turkey by employing four different timeframe which are on
the day (lag 0), 3 days ago (lag 3), 7 days ago (lag 7) and 14 days ago (lag 14).
We have considered population density as a control variable. The dataset cover
COVID-19 cases, population density, average temperature, humidity, pressure, dew 
point, wind speed, and sunshine duration for 81 provinces of Turkey. We find that
population density has a positive correlation with COVID-19 cases. We also find
that in lag 3, all parameters except for sunshine duration are negatively
correlated with COVID-19 cases and significant. However, only 3 parameters,
temperature, air pressure and dew point are negatively correlated with COVID-19
cases and significant for lag 0, lag 7 and lag 14. In addition, temperature, air 
pressure and dew point parameters are negative and significant in all timeframes.
