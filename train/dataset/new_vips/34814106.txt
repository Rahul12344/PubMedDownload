In 2017, a major outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection took place in Chincha
Province, Peru, where arboviral circulation had never been reported before. We
conducted a cross-sectional survey (March-May 2019) in two districts of Chincha
Province: Pueblo Nuevo and Chincha Baja. We included residents who were 20 to 40 
years old and who had lived in these districts for at least 1 year. Serological
testing combined screening with a commercial NS1 protein-based Zika IgG ELISA,
and confirmation by a cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (VNT).
Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated using Poisson regression with robust
error variance. Four hundred participants, divided equally among districts, were 
enrolled. Anti-ZIKV IgG ELISA was positive for 42 participants (10.5%) and
borderline for 12 (3%). Fifty-two of these 54 samples were confirmed positive by 
ZIKV VNT (13% of the total population). The Pueblo Nuevo district exhibited a
greater ZIKV seroprevalence based on VNT results than the Chincha Baja district
(23.5% versus 2.5%), with participants from the Pueblo Nuevo district being 9.4
times more likely to have a positive ZIKV VNT result. Average monthly income
greater than the minimum wage and adequate water storage were found to be
protective factors (PR, 0.29 and 0.24, respectively). In multivariate analysis,
living in the Pueblo Nuevo district and a personal history of fever and rash were
strong predictors of ZIKV positivity by VNT. The low ZIKV seroprevalence should
prompt health authorities to stimulate interventions to prevent potential future 
outbreaks. In the Pueblo Nuevo district, the seroprevalence was greater but
presumably not sufficient to ensure protective herd immunity.
