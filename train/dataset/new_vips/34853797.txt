Immune responses to adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids limit the therapeutic
potential of AAV gene therapy. Herein, we model clinical immune responses by
generating AAV capsid-specific chimeric antigen receptor (AAV-CAR) T cells. We
then modulate immune responses to AAV capsid with AAV-CAR regulatory T cells
(Tregs). AAV-CAR Tregs in vitro display phenotypical Treg surface marker
expression, and functional suppression of effector T cell proliferation and
cytotoxicity. In mouse models, AAV-CAR Tregs mediated continued transgene
expression from an immunogenic capsid, despite antibody responses, produced
immunosuppressive cytokines, and decreased tissue inflammation. AAV-CAR Tregs are
also able to bystander suppress immune responses to immunogenic transgenes
similarly mediating continued transgene expression, producing immunosuppressive
cytokines, and reducing tissue infiltration. Taken together, AAV-CAR T cells and 
AAV-CAR Tregs are directed and powerful immunosuppressive tools to model and
modulate immune responses to AAV capsids and transgenes in the local environment.
