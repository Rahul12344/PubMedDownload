Variability in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 disease severity between
individuals is partly due to genetic factors. Here, we identify 4 genomic loci
with suggestive associations for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and 19 for COVID-19
disease severity. Four of these 23 loci likely have an ethnicity-specific
component. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals in 11 loci colocalize
with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with the expression of
20 genes in 62 tissues/cell types (range: 1:43 tissues/gene), including lung,
brain, heart, muscle, and skin as well as the digestive system and immune system.
We perform genetic fine mapping to compute 99% credible SNP sets, which identify 
10 GWAS loci that have eight or fewer SNPs in the credible set, including three
loci with one single likely causal SNP. Our study suggests that the diverse
symptoms and disease severity of COVID-19 observed between individuals is
associated with variants across the genome, affecting gene expression levels in a
wide variety of tissue types.
