BACKGROUND: Harm reduction programs often lack community-based support and can be
controversial, despite data demonstrating effectiveness. This article describes
one small Alaskan community's development of a harm reduction managed alcohol
program (MAP) in the context of a city-run quarantine site for individuals
experiencing homelessness. The MAP was developed to support quarantining by
COVID-19-exposed or COVID-positive individuals who also experienced chronic
homelessness, a severe alcohol use disorder, and heightened health risks related 
to potentially unsupported alcohol withdrawal.
METHOD: Five interviews with key informants involved in planning or
implementation of the MAP were conducted using rapid qualitative analysis and
narrative analysis techniques.
OUTCOME: This study documents the planning and implementation of an innovative
application of a managed alcohol harm reduction intervention in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic. In this instance, a MAP was used specifically to limit
hospital admissions for alcohol withdrawal during a surge of cases in the
community, as well as to mitigate spread of the virus. Key informants report no
residents enrolled in the MAP program as a part of quarantine required
hospitalization for withdrawal or for COVID symptoms, and no shelter resident
left the quarantine site while still contagious with COVID-19. Additionally, the 
level of community support for the program was much higher than originally
expected by organizers.
CONCLUSIONS: This program highlighted an example of how a community recognized
the complexity and potential risk to individuals experiencing structural
vulnerability related to homelessness and a severe AUD, and the community at
large, and was able to create an alternative path to minimize those risks using a
harm reduction strategy.
