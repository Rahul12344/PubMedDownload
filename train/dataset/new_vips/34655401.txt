On 13 May 2020, a COVID-19 cluster was detected in a French processing plant.
Infected workers were described. The associations between the SARS-CoV-2
infection and the socio-demographic and occupational characteristics were
assessed in order to implement risk management measures targeting workers at
increased risk of contamination. Workers were tested by RT-PCR from samples taken
during screening campaigns. Workers who tested positive were isolated and their
contacts were quarantined. Workers were described and associations with the
SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed through risk ratios using multivariable
Poisson regression. Of the 1347 workers, 87.5% were tested: 140 cases were
identified; 4 were hospitalised, including 2 admitted to intensive care. In the
company, the cluster remained limited to deboning and cutting activities. The
attack rate was 11.9% in the company, reaching 16.6% in the cutting department.
Being an employee of a subcontractor significantly increased the risk of
infection by 2.98 [1.81-4.99]. In the cutting department, an association with
virus infection was found for a group of non-French speaking workers from the
same Eastern European country (RR = 2.67 [1.76-4.05]). They shared accommodation 
or carpooled more frequently than the other cases. The outbreak investigation
revealed a significantly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for workers of
subcontractors and some foreign-born workers. There are many such populations in 
meat processing plants; the observed associations and the ways in which these
workers are contaminated need to be confirmed by further work. Prevention
campaigns should now target these workers. Environmental risk factors in the
workplace setting remain to be clarified.
