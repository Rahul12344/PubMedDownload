Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection is
not confined to the respiratory system, but has also shown extra-pulmonary
invasion including the nervous system. About 36.4% of hospitalized patients in
China with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection had
neurological manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the human body through
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors on the surface of human cells
and causes disease. ACE2 receptors are also expressed on the surface of spinal
cord cells. More rare neurologic conditions have been reported in the literature 
to be associated with COVID-19 such as acute transverse myelitis (ATM), Guillain 
Barre syndrome, acute flaccid myelitis, etc. We report two cases of confirmed
COVID-19 who presented four to five days of their COVID-19 symptoms and
progressive bilateral lower limb weakness and urinary retention. ATM is an
acquired spinal cord disorder. ATM is a relatively common neurological
complication of COVID-19, accounting for 1.2% of all neurological complications
associated with COVID-19. The mechanism by which COVID-19 causes ATM is not
completely understood but has been assumed to be due to the structural
resemblance of RNA viruses. Entrance of SARS-CoV-2 to the nervous system can take
place through two pathways, either directly or indirectly. The direct pathway is 
through trans-synaptic transmission from the peripheral nervous system or by
hematogenous spread into the blood-brain barrier through ACE-2, while the
indirect pathway is through a systemic immune response.
