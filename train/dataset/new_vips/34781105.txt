Historically, virus taxonomy has been limited to describing viruses that were
readily cultivated in the laboratory or emerging in natural biomes. Metagenomic
analyses, single-particle sequencing, and database mining efforts have yielded
new sequence data on an astounding number of previously unknown viruses. As
metagenomes are relatively free of biases, these data provide an unprecedented
insight into the vastness of the virosphere, but to properly value the extent of 
this diversity it is critical that the viruses are taxonomically classified.
Inclusion of uncultivated viruses has already improved the process as well as the
understanding of the taxa, viruses, and their evolutionary relationships. The
continuous development and testing of computational tools will be required to
maintain a dynamic virus taxonomy that can accommodate the new discoveries.
