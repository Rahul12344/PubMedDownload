Annette Kennedy's four year term as President of the International Council of
Nurses ended during the organisation's virtual Congress in November. Here she
writes about her time in office and the state of the world's nursing after 2
years of the pandemic. She acknowledges the strains that COVID-19 has put on
nursing but affirms that nurses and nursing have come through the pandemic as a
stronger, more influential and more cohesive profession.
