The increasing burden of cancer represents a substantial problem for Latin
America and the Caribbean. Two Lancet Oncology Commissions in 2013 and 2015
highlighted potential interventions that could advance cancer care in the region 
by overcoming existing challenges. Areas requiring improvement included
insufficient investment in cancer control, non-universal health coverage,
fragmented health systems, inequitable concentration of cancer services,
inadequate registries, delays in diagnosis or treatment initiation, and
insufficient palliative services. Progress has been made in key areas but remains
uneven across the region. An unforeseen challenge, the COVID-19 pandemic,
strained all resources, and its negative effect on cancer control is expected to 
continue for years. In this Series paper, we summarise progress in several
aspects of cancer control since 2015, and identify persistent barriers requiring 
commitment of additional resources to reduce the cancer burden in Latin America
and the Caribbean.
