Pandemics caused by viruses have resulted in incalculable losses to human beings,
which are exacerbated due to the lack of antiviral drugs. Sulfonic group modified
nanomedicine has been proved to possess a broad-spectrum antiviral ability.
However, it is very challenging to maintain the antiviral activity in a high
protein environment in vivo. To improve the tolerance to the complex biological
environment, sulfonic mixed-charge modified gold nanoparticles (MC_AuNPs) were
prepared in this research by introducing positively charged ligands into sulfonic
ligand modified gold nanoparticles. The MC_AuNPs showed excellent non-fouling
ability while retaining comparable antiviral ability to single sulfonic ligand
modified gold nanoparticles (MDS_AuNPs). The MC_AuNPs maintained their antiviral 
ability in 10 mg mL-1 protein solutions, but the MDS_AuNPs completely lost their 
antiviral capability in 1 mg mL-1 protein medium. The mixed-charge modification
strategy provides a practical avenue to maintain the antiviral capability of HSPG
mimicking nanoparticles in high protein environments.
