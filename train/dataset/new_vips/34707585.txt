Emerging concerns following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV2) pandemic are the long-term effects of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19.
Dysgeusia in COVID-19 is supported by the abundant expression of the entry
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), in the oral mucosa. The
invading virus perturbs the commensal biofilm and regulates the host responses
that permit or suppress viral infection. We correlated the microbial recognition 
receptors and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) with the SARS-CoV2 measures in the saliva of
COVID-19 patients. Data indicate that the toll-like receptor-4, peptidoglycan
recognition protein, and sACE2 are elevated in COVID-19 saliva and correlate
moderately with the viral load.
