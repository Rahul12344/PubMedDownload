Background: When a new health programme is introduced, it is crucial to estimate 
the costs for rational health policy decision-making. The aim of this study was
to determine the costs of implementing two strategies for hepatitis C virus (HCV)
screening in rural Cambodia.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed clinical and cost data that were collected
routinely for a demonstration project for scaling up HCV screening and testing in
Cambodia. The programme data were collected between March and December 2018 in
Maung Russey operational district in Battambang Province, Cambodia.
Findings: During the study period, 24 230 people were screened; 1194 (5%) were
HCV seropositive, of whom 793 (66%) were confirmed to be viraemic. During the
study period, 18% of the estimated population of the operational district were
screened, of whom 45% were estimated to be seropositive and 41% to be viraemic.
With passive screening alone, 8% of the estimated population were screened, of
whom 29% were estimated to be seropositive and 28% viraemic. The cost per
detected viraemic case was US$ 194 for passive screening alone and US$ 283 for
passive and active screening combined. Labour costs (31%) and tests and materials
(29%) comprised the largest proportions of the cost.
Conclusion: Combined active and passive screening per viraemic case detected was 
US$ 89 more expensive than passive screening alone but provided a higher yield
(41% versus 28%) of viraemic cases. Therefore, adding active screening to passive
screening is beneficial. Selective active screening strategies, such as targeting
people over 45 years and other higher-risk groups, added value for HCV diagnosis.
