ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification catalyzed by writer enzymes
- ADP-ribosyltransferases. The modification is part of many signaling events, can
modulate the function and stability of target proteins, and often results in the 
recruitment of reader proteins that bind to the ADP-ribosyl groups. Erasers are
integral actors in these signaling events and reverse the modification.
ADP-ribosylation can be targeted with therapeutics and many inhibitors against
writers exist, with some being in clinical use. Inhibitors against readers and
erasers are sparser and development of these has gained momentum only in recent
years. Drug discovery has been hampered by the lack of specific tools, however
many significant advances in the methods have recently been reported. We discuss 
assays used in the field with a focus on methods allowing efficient
identification of small molecule inhibitors and profiling against enzyme
families. While human proteins are focused, the methods can be also applied to
bacterial toxins and virus encoded erasers that can be targeted to treat
infectious diseases in the future.
