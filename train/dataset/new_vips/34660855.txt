Amniotic membrane is attracting attention as a new material for regenerative
medicine. We herein report that the culture of primary rat hepatocytes on human
amniotic membrane maintained their morphology and their production of albumin for
at least two months. Human amniotic membrane was collected during planned
cesarean section and kept frozen until usage. Primary rat hepatocytes were plated
on human amniotic membrane. Hepatocytes accumulated as colonies on amniotic
membrane, and their rat albumin level was maintained for two months. Their
three-dimensional structure on extracellular matrix, which is abundant in
amniotic membranes might influence the maintenance of the hepatocyte-specific
function.
