Hypercoagulability and vascular injury, which characterize morbidity in COVID-19 
disease, are frequently observed in the skin. Several pathomechanisms, such as
inflammation caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-mediated uptake into
endothelial cells or SARS-CoV-2-initiated host immune responses, contribute to
microthrombus formation and the appearance of vascular skin lesions. Besides
pathophysiologic mechanisms observed in the skin, this review describes the
clinical appearance of cutaneous vascular lesions and their association with
COVID-19 disease, including acro-ischemia, reticular lesions, and cutaneous small
vessel vasculitis. Clinicians need to be aware that skin manifestations may be
the only symptom in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that inflammatory and thrombotic
SARS-CoV-2-driven processes observed in multiple organs and tissues appear
identically in the skin as well.
