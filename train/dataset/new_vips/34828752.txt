Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous virus, and CMV-associated diseases range
from mild illness in immunologically normal hosts to life-threatening diseases in
newborns and immunocompromised children. This study investigated the association 
between childhood CMV infection and subsequent epilepsy or neurodevelopmental
disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). A retrospective analysis was performed on data for 69 children
with confirmed CMV infections (CMV infection group) and 292 patients with other
infections (control group) between 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2012. The
results indicated that the CMV infection group had a higher risk of epilepsy in
comparison to the control (odds ratio (OR), 16.4; 95% CI (confidence interval),
3.32-80.7; p = 0.001). Epilepsy risk increased in younger children (age 0-2) with
CMV infection when compared to the control group (OR, 32.6; 95% CI, 3.84-276; p =
0.001). The ASD risk was also determined to be higher in the CMV infection group 
(OR, 17.9; 95% CI, 1.96-162; p = 0.01). The ADHD risk between the groups was not 
significant. This study suggests that CMV infection in infancy may increase the
risk of subsequent epilepsy and ASD, especially in infants younger than 2 years, 
but is not associated with ADHD.
