INTRODUCTION: Since the global outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a significant
reduction in pediatric outpatient and emergency visits for infectious diseases.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the changes in respiratory viruses in
children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Shanghai in the past
10 years, especially in the first year after COVID-19.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study; the results for eight
common respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A 
and B, parainfluenza virus 1-3 (PIV), adenovirus (ADV) and human metapneumovirus)
tested by direct fluorescent antibody assays in hospitalized CAP cases in
Children's Hospital of Fudan University during 2010-2020 were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 5544 hospitalized CAP patients included in this study, 20.2%
(1125/5544) were positive for the eight respiratory viruses. The top three
pathogens were RSV, PIV3 and ADV, detected from 9.8% (543/5544), 5.3% (294/5544) 
and 2.0% (111/5544) of the samples, respectively. RSV had the highest positive
rates among children < 2 years old. In 2020, the detection rate of all viruses
showed a sharp decline from February to August compared with the previous
9 years. When the Shanghai community reopened in August 2020, the detection rate 
of eight viruses rebounded significantly in September.
CONCLUSIONS: These eight respiratory viruses, especially RSV and PIV, were
important pathogens of CAP in Shanghai children in the past 10 years. The
COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the detection rates for eight
respiratory viruses in children with CAP in Shanghai.
