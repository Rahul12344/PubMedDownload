Novel SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging at an alarming rate. The delta variant and
other variants of concern (VoC) carry spike (S)-protein mutations, which have the
potential to evade protective immunity, to trigger break-through infections after
COVID-19 vaccination, and to propagate future waves of COVID-19 pandemic. To
identify SARS CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh, patients who are RT-PCR-positive for 
COVID-19 infections in Dhaka were screened by a RT-PCR melting curve analysis for
spike protein mutations. To assess the anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody responses, the
levels of the anti-S -proteins IgA and IgG and the anti-N-protein IgG were
measured by ELISA. Of a total of 36 RT-PCR positive samples (75%), 27 were
identified as delta variants, with one carrying an additional Q677H mutation and 
two with single nucleotide substitutions at position 23029 (compared to
Wuhan-Hu-1 reference NC 045512) in the genome sequence. Three (8.3%) were
identified as beta variants, two (5.5%) were identified as alpha variants, three 
(8.3%) were identified as having a B.1.1.318 lineage, and one sample was
identified as an eta variant (B.1.525) carrying an additional V687L mutation. The
trend of higher viral load (lower Cp values) among delta variants than in the
alpha and beta variants was of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.045).
Prospective studies with larger Bangladeshi cohorts are warranted to confirm the 
emergence of S-protein mutations and their association with antibody response in 
natural infection and potential breakthrough in vaccinated subjects.
