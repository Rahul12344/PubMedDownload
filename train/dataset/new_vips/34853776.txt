Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a ubiquitous environmental toxicant from the Per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) family has been implicated in toxicity of
various organs. Several epidemiological studies have linked PFOA to different
lung injuries and diseased conditions. However, the implication of PFOA in
affecting epigenetic regulators and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways in the lung are
unknown. The present work explores the accumulation of PFOA in lungs and changes 
in mRNA expression of DNA methylation regulator genes DNA methyltransferases
(Dnmts) and ten-eleven translocation (Tets) along with the membrane proteins
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2
(Tmprss2) genes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. CD1 mice were orally 
exposed to 5 and 20 mg/kg/day PFOA for 10 days and the lung tissues were analyzed
using LCMS, qPCR, and pyrosequencing techniques. PFOA was shown to accumulate in 
the lung tissues and increase in a dose-dependent manner. Dnmts and Tets were
significantly downregulated upon at least one of the PFOA dosing concentration,
whereas Ace2 and Tmprss2 show significant increase in their expression level.
Further, CpG islands in the promotor region of Tmprss2 exhibited significant
hypomethylation in PFOA treated groups, which supports its increased gene
expression level. Current study reveals the implication of PFOA induced DNA
methylation changes in lungs and their possible role in upregulation of Ace2 and 
Tmprss2. It is possible that increased expression of these membrane receptors due
to PFOA exposure can lead to higher susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
