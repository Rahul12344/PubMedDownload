A novel positive single-stranded RNA virus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirus 9 
(SsHV9), was identified in the plant-pathogenic Sclerotinia sclerotiorum strain
GB375, which was associated with a garden bean plant in the United States. The
complete genome of SsHV9 is 14,067 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A)
tail. It has a single large open reading frame encoding a putative polyprotein
(4,196 amino acids), which is predicted to contain a papain-like protease, a
protein of unknown function, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and an RNA
helicase. Phylogenetic analysis based on a multiple alignment of amino acid
sequences of polyproteins that suggested SsHV9 belongs to the proposed genus
"Alphahypovirus" in the family Hypoviridae.
