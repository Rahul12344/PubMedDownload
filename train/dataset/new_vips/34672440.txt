BACKGROUND: Patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are
susceptible to superimposed infections.
OBJECTIVES: To describe COVID-19 patients who presented with complications due to
Candida bloodstream co-infection (candidemia) and their outcome in a single
center in northern Israel (Emek Medical Center) during the second outbreak of
COVID-19 in Israel (15 June 2020 to 20 September 2020).
METHODS: A retrospective study of COVID-19 patients presenting with candidemia
was conducted, including clinical and laboratory data. The incidence of
candidemia among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was compared to a historical
cohort of non-COVID-19 controls.
RESULTS: Three COVID-19 patients complicated with candidemia were documented. All
three patients died shortly after the detection of candidemia. Three different
Candida sp. were isolated from the blood cultures: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, 
and C. glabrata. The incidence of candidemia among COVID-19 patients was 0.679
episodes per 1000 hospital days.
CONCLUSIONS: Our small sample suggests a much higher incidence of candidemia
among COVID-19 patients compared to a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls.
All clinicians treating COVID-19 patients in GICU should be aware of this
complication.
