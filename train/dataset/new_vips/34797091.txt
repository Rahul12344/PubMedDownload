BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted the
provision or exacerbated the existing gap of access to essential healthcare
services. An unanticipated effect on access to healthcare services emerged with
the introduction of COVID-19 lockdown regulations. Violence against women is
prevalent with varying degrees of severity in all spheres of society.
METHODS: This study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
access to healthcare services for the victims of sexual assault in the Mthatha
region of South Africa. This is a records review of victims of sexual assault
survivors who visited and were treated at the Sinawe TCC at Mthatha Regional
Hospital. The data on sexual assault cases at Sinawe TCC were compared with a
time-matched control group from 2014 to 2020.
RESULTS: There were 5747 sexual assault cases reported at Sinawe TCC between 01
January 2014 and 31 December 2020. There was a major drop in reported cases at
Sinawe TCC during the 2020 year, with only about half (451) of the annual average
cases being reported.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on access to healthcare services 
for the victims of sexual assault survivors in the Mthatha region of South
Africa.
