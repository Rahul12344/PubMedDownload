COVID-19 has been altering all aspects of societal life including community
mobility since December 2019. This study analyzes the spatial-temporal variations
in human mobility patterns as the influence of COVID-19 during different periods 
at the state and union territory (UT) levels in India. From the spatial and
temporal perspective, we find that change of mobility patterns and variations
within states and UTs. The residential mobility has been increased because the
mobility towards the home increased during the lockdown and the second wave but
during the unlocking period reduced to some extent. There have spatial variations
in mobility towards different places within states and UTs during the lockdown
and second wave (lockdown to partial lockdown) but overall mobility towards
different places like retail, parks, workplace, and transit stations have been
reduced in India. During unlocking, mobility has been reduced all over the states
and UTs in India but there have spatial-temporal variations within.
