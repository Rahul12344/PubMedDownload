Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severely affecting public health
and the global economy. Adaptive immunity plays a crucial role in fighting
against SARS-CoV-2 infection and directly influences the clinical outcomes of
patients. Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVID-19
exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by
which SARS-CoV-2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in 
vitro cell line, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly
inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination
in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes 
in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein 
BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site. Our findings reveal a potential
molecular mechanism by which the spike protein might impede adaptive immunity and
underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines.
