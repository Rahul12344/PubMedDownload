The COVID-19 pandemic represents a milestone in vaccine research and development 
in a global context. A worldwide effort, as never seen before, involved
scientists from all over the world in favor of the fast, accurate and precise
construction and testing of immunogens against the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
Among all the vaccine strategies put into play for study and validation, those
based on recombinant viral vectors gained special attention due to their
effectiveness, ease of production and the amplitude of the triggered immune
responses. Some of these new vaccines have already been approved for
emergency/full use, while others are still in pre- and clinical trials. In this
article we will highlight what is behind adeno-associated vectors, such as those 
presented by the immunogens ChaAdOx1, Sputnik, Convidecia (CanSino, Tianjin,
China), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson, New Jersey, EUA), in addition to other
promising platforms such as Vaccinia virus MVA, influenza virus, and measles
virus, among others.
