BACKGROUND: As genetically resistant individuals, the "elite controllers" (ECs)
of human immunodeficiency virus infection have been focused on as the keys to
developing further functional treatments in medicine. In the livestock production
field, identifying the ECs of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle is 
desired to stop BLV transmission chains on farms. Cattle carrying the bovine
leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3*009:02 allele (DRB3*009:02) have a strong
possibility of being BLV ECs. Most of cattle carrying this allele maintain
undetectable BLV proviral loads and do not shed virus even when infected. BLV ECs
can act as transmission barriers when placed between uninfected and infected
cattle in a barn. To identify cattle carrying DRB3*009:02 in large populations
more easily, we developed a pooled testing system. It employs a highly sensitive,
specific real-time PCR assay and TaqMan MGB probes (DRB3*009:02-TaqMan assay).
Using this system, we determined the percentage of DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle on
Kyushu Island, Japan.
RESULTS: Our pooled testing system detected cattle carrying the DRB3*009:02
allele from a DNA pool containing one DRB3*009:02-positive animal and 29 cattle
with other alleles. Its capacity is sufficient for herd-level screening for
DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle. The DRB3*009:02-TaqMan assay showed high
discriminative sensitivity and specificity towards DRB3*009:02, making it
suitable for identifying DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle in post-screening tests on
individuals. We determined that the percentage of DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle in 
Kyushu Island was 10.56 %.
CONCLUSIONS: With its ease of use and reliable detection, this new method
strengthens the laboratory typing for DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle. Thus, our
findings support the use of BLV ECs in the field. This article is protected by
