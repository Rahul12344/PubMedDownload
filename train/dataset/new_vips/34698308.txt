This study investigates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions and
tears and evaluates ocular symptoms in a group of patients with COVID-19. We
included 56 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in this cross-sectional cohort
study. Conjunctival secretions and tears were collected using flocked swabs and
Schirmer strips for SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). Assessment of ocular surface manifestations included an OSDI (Ocular
Surface Disease Index) questionnaire. Patients had been admitted to hospital for 
an average of 2.4 days (range 0-7) and had shown general symptoms for an average 
of 7.1 days (range 1-20) prior to ocular testing. Four (7.1%) of 56 conjunctival 
swabs and four (4%) of 112 Schirmer strips were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean
E-gene cycle threshold values (Ct values) were 31.2 (SD 5.0) in conjunctival
swabs and 32.9 (SD 2.7) in left eye Schirmer strips. Overall, 17 (30%) patients
presented ocular symptoms. No association was found between positive ocular
samples and ocular symptoms. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on 
the conjunctiva and tears of patients with COVID-19. Contact with the ocular
surface may transmit the virus and preventive measures should be taken in this
direction.
