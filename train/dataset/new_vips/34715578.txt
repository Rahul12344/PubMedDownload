TIA-1 (T cell restricted intracellular antigen-1) is a kind of RNA-binding
protein which serves as the downstream of CED-9 (a BCL2 homolog) and induces
apoptosis under stress conditions. So far, the function of apoptosis mediated by 
TIA-1 has been extensively studied in higher animals, and apoptosis happens to be
related to biological immune defense. However, the involvement of TIA-1 in the
study of immune function during viral infection has not been clearly studied,
especially in marine invertebrates. In the study, SpTIA-1 in mud crab (Scylla
paramamosain) was specifically identified. The Open Reading Frame (ORF) of
SpTIA-1 was consisted of 1116 nucleotide bases and encoded 372 amino acids.
Besides, the results showed that the expression of SpTIA-1 was obviously
up-regulated during WSSV (White Spot Syndrome Virus) infection in hemocytes of
mud crab. Furthermore, through RNAi approach, we found that SpTIA-1 could
activate Caspase-3 signaling and increase ROS levels to reduce mitochondrial
membrane potential, resulting in the increase of apoptosis rate in hemocytes,
which eventually suppressed WSSV multiplication in mud crab. The current study
therefore improves the knowledge of antiviral immunity in mud crab and provides
new insights into the innate immunity of marine crustaceans.
