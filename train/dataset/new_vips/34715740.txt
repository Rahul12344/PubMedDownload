A 60-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with worsening
shortness of breath and non-productive cough for 1 week, which was preceding a
recent COVID-19 infection. At the time the patient thought this was part of the
constellation of symptoms of COVID-19, so she stayed home until her symptoms
worsened to the point of needing hospitalization. The patient was found to have a
rare and complex congenital heart disease that led her to develop acute heart
failure precipitated by COVID-19 pneumonia. Medical management and surgical
repair were essential in this patient given the late presentation.
