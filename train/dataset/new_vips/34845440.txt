Determining how antibodies interact with the spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 
virus is critical for combating COVID-19. Structural studies typically employ
simplified, truncated constructs that may not fully recapitulate the behavior of 
the original complexes. Here, we combine two single particle mass analysis
techniques (mass photometry and charge-detection mass spectrometry) to enable the
measurement of full IgG binding to the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain. Our
experiments reveal that antibodies targeting the S-trimer typically prefer
stoichiometries lower than the symmetry-predicted 3:1 binding. We determine that 
this behavior arises from the interplay of steric clashes and avidity effects
that are not reflected in common antibody constructs (i.e., Fabs). Surprisingly, 
these substoichiometric complexes are fully effective at blocking ACE2 binding
despite containing free receptor binding sites. Our results highlight the
importance of studying antibody/antigen interactions using complete, multimeric
constructs and showcase the utility of single particle mass analyses in
unraveling these complex interactions.
