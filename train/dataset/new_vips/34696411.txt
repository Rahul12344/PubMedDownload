Viral proteases are indispensable for successful virion maturation, thus making
them a prominent drug target. Their enzyme activity is tightly spatiotemporally
regulated by expression in the precursor form with little or no activity,
followed by activation via autoprocessing. These cleavage events are frequently
triggered upon transportation to a specific compartment inside the host cell.
Typically, precursor oligomerization or the presence of a co-factor is needed for
activation. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms will allow ligands with 
non-canonical mechanisms of action to be designed, which would specifically
modulate the initial irreversible steps of viral protease autoactivation. Binding
sites exclusive to the precursor, including binding sites beyond the protease
domain, can be exploited. Both inhibition and up-regulation of the proteolytic
activity of viral proteases can be detrimental for the virus. All these
possibilities are discussed using examples of medically relevant viruses
including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, retroviruses, picornaviruses,
caliciviruses, togaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses.
