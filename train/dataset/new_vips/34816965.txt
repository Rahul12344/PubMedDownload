OBJECTIVE: to identify the main nursing care procedures for performing bed bath
in patients with COVID-19.
METHOD: an integrative literature review. Five stages were followed for this
research: research question elaboration (identification of the problem), search
of studies in literature, study assessment, data analysis, and presentation of
review. To search for primary studies, the VHL and SciELO databases were
selected.
RESULTS: initially, 55 publications were found. After reading and analyzing the
abstracts, the sample consisted of 15 studies.
CONCLUSION: patients with the new coronavirus have specific care to perform a bed
bath, oral, intimate and skin hygiene. It is important that professionals use
adequate personal protective equipment, perform humanized care, continuously
observing patients' vital signs to avoid occurrence of adverse events, promoting 
patient safety.
