Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious affection of the lung
caused by a variety of pathologies. Great interest is currently focused on ARDS
induced by viruses (pandemic influenza and corona viruses). The review describes 
pulmonary changes in ARDS and specific effects of the pandemic viruses in ARDS,
and summarizes treatment options. Because the known pathogenic mechanisms cannot 
explain all aspects of the syndrome, the contribution of pulmonary lymphatics to 
the pathology is discussed. Organization and function of lymphatics in a healthy 
lung and in resorption of pulmonary edema are described. A future clinical trial 
may provide more insight into the role of hyaluronan in ARDS but the development 
of promising pharmacological treatments is unlikely because drugs play no
important role in lymphedema therapy.
