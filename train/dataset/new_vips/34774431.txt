Genetic testing using reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction
(rRT-PCR) is the mainstay of diagnosis of COVID-19. However, it has not been
fully investigated whether infectious viruses are contained in SARS-CoV-2
genome-positive specimens examined using the rRT-PCR test. In this study, we
examined the correlation between the threshold Cycle (Ct) value obtained from the
rRT-PCR test and virus isolation in cultured cells, using 533 consecutive
clinical specimens of COVID-19 patients. The virus was isolated from specimens
with a Ct value of less than 30 cycles, and the lower the Ct value, the more
efficient the isolation rate. A cytopathic effect due to herpes simplex virus
type 1 contamination was observed in one sample with a Ct value of 35 cycles. In 
a comparison of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and VeroE6 cells used for virus isolation,
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells isolated the virus 1.7 times more efficiently than VeroE6
cells. There was no significant difference between the two cells in the mean Ct
value of the detectable sample. In conclusion, Lower Ct values in the PCR test
were associated with higher virus isolation rates, and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were 
able to isolate viruses more efficiently than VeroE6 cells.
