Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in plants is a defense mechanism against DNA
virus infection. The genomes of viruses in the Geminiviridae family encode
several TGS suppressors. In this study, we induced de novo TGS against the
transgenic GFP gene encoding green fluorescent protein by expressing a
hairpin-shaped self-complementary RNA corresponding to the enhancer region of the
35S promoter (hpE35S). In addition, we examined the TGS suppression activity of
proteins encoded in the genome of Tobacco yellow dwarf virus (TYDV, genus
Mastrevirus). The results show that the replication-associated protein (Rep) and 
RepA encoded by TYDV have TGS suppressor activity and lead to decreased
accumulation of 24-nt siRNAs. These results suggest that Rep and RepA can block
the steps before the loading of siRNAs into Argonaute (AGO) proteins. This is the
first report of TGS suppressors in the genus Mastrevirus.
