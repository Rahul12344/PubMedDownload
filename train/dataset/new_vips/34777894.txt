Diagnostic testing plays a fundamental role in the mitigation and containment of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as it enables immediate quarantine of those 
who are infected and contagious and is essential for the epidemiological
characterization of the virus and estimating the number of infected cases
worldwide. Confirmation of viral infections, such as COVID-19, can be achieved
through two general approaches: nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) or
molecular tests and serological or antibody-based tests. The genetic material of 
the pathogen is detected in NAAT, and in serological tests, host antibodies
produced in response to the pathogen are identified. Other methods of diagnosing 
COVID-19 include radiological imaging of the lungs and in vitro detection of
viral antigens. This review covers the different approaches available for
diagnosing COVID-19 by outlining their advantages and shortcomings, as well as
appropriate indications for more accurate testing.
