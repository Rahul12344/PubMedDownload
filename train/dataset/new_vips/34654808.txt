Vaccine breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection has been monitored in 3720 healthcare
workers receiving 2 doses of BNT162b2. SARS-CoV-2 infection is detected in 33
subjects, with a 100-day cumulative incidence of 0.93%. Vaccine protection
against acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 83% (95%CI: 58-93%) in the overall
population and 93% (95%CI: 69-99%) in SARS-CoV-2-experienced subjects, when
compared with a non-vaccinated control group from the same Institution, in which 
SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in 20/346 subjects (100-day cumulative incidence:
5.78%). The infection is symptomatic in 16 (48%) vaccinated subjects vs 17 (85%) 
controls (p = 0.01). All analyzed patients, in whom the amount of viral RNA was
sufficient for genome sequencing, results infected by the alpha variant. Antibody
and T-cell responses are not reduced in subjects with breakthrough infection.
Evidence of virus transmission, determined by contact tracing, is observed in two
(6.1%) cases. This real-world data support the protective effect of BNT162b2
vaccine. A triple antigenic exposure, such as two-dose vaccine schedule in
experienced subjects, may confer a higher protection.
