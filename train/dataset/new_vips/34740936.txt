INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has spread with high morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Many inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being tested at various clinical trial
stages for the control and prevention of COVID-19. We aim to comprehensively and 
objectively evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2
vaccines in healthy individuals through a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search electronic databases of PubMed, the Cochrane
Library, Web of Science and EMBASE for RCTs from inception to 31 December 2021.
We will also search conference abstracts, reference lists, and grey literature of
all available records. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract
information from the literature. Bias and the quality of included studies will be
evaluated with the risk-bias assessment tool provided by the Cochrane
Collaboration. Statistical analysis will be performed using Cochrane's Review
Manager (RevMan), V.5.3.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and patient informed consent are not
required because we will be including published literature only. The findings of 
this research will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and likely through 
other scientific events such as conferences, seminars and symposia.
