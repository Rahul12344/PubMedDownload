The PD-1: PD-L1 is a potent inhibitory pathway involved in immune regulation and 
a potential therapeutic target in transplantation. In this study, we show that
overexpression of PD-1 (PD-1 Tg) on T cells promotes allograft tolerance in a
fully MHC-mismatched cardiac transplant model when combined with costimulation
blockade (CTLA-4-Ig). PD-1 overexpression on T cells also protected against
chronic rejection in a single MHC II mismatched cardiac transplant model, while
it still allowed the generation of an effective immune response against an
Influenza A virus. Notably, Treg cells from PD-1 Tg mice were required for
tolerance induction and presented higher ICOS expression than those from
wild-type mice. Survival benefit of PD-1 Tg recipients required ICOS signaling
and donor PD-L1 expression. These results indicate that modulation of PD-1
expression, in combination with a costimulation blockade, is a promising
therapeutic target to promote transplant tolerance.
