The Gag polyprotein is implied in the budding as well as the establishment of the
supramolecular architecture of infectious retroviral particles. It is also
involved in the early phases of the replication of retroviruses by protecting and
transporting the viral genome towards the nucleus of the infected cell until its 
integration in the host genome. Therefore, understanding the structure-function
relationships of the Gag subunits is crucial as each of them can represent a
therapeutic target. Though the field has been explored for some time in the area 
of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), it is only in the last decade that
structural data on Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) Gag subunits have emerged.
As FIV is an important veterinary issue, both in domestic cats and endangered
feline species, such data are of prime importance for the development of anti-FIV
molecules targeting Gag. This review will focus on the recent advances and
perspectives on the structure-function relationships of each subunit of the FIV
Gag polyprotein.
