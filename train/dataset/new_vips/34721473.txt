Broad bean wilt virus 2 (BBWV2) is an emerging virus in various economically
important crops, especially pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), worldwide. Recently, the
emergence of various BBWV2 strains that induce severe symptoms has increased
damage to pepper crops. While the symptomatic variations among virus strains
should be associated with differences in the transcriptomic reprogramming of host
plants upon infection, underlying molecular mechanisms and associated genes are
largely unknown. In the present study, we employed transcriptome analysis to
identify responsible host factors for symptom enhancement in the BBWV2-pepper
pathosystem using two distinct BBWV2 strains, PAP1 (a severe strain) and RP1 (a
mild strain). Comparative analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
revealed that various genes associated with pathogen-associated molecular pattern
(PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and ethylene signaling were significantly
upregulated upon infection with the severe PAP1 strain, but not with the mild RP1
strain. Indeed, hormone analysis revealed that ethylene emission was
significantly increased in pepper plants infected with PAP1. These observations
imply that the activation of the PTI-associated defense responses reinforce
symptom formation during BBWV2 infection in a virus strain-specific manner.
