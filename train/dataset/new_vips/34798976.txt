Infectious meningitis and encephalitis are associated with significant morbidity 
and mortality worldwide. Acute bacterial meningitis is rapidly fatal and early
recognition and institution of therapy are imperative. Viral meningitis is
typically a benign self-limited illness. Chronic meningitis (defined as
presenting with >4 weeks of symptoms) is most often caused by tuberculosis and
fungal infection. Because the diagnostic testing for tuberculous meningitis is
insensitive and cultures often take weeks to grow, therapy is often initiated
empirically when the diagnosis is suspected. Human simplex virus encephalitis is 
the most common cause of encephalitis and requires prompt treatment with
intravenous acyclovir.
