Nearly 4,00,000 farmers committed suicide in India between 1995 and 2018. This
translates into approximately 48 suicides every day. The majority of suicides
were those from 'backwarded' castes including Dalit farmers. This ethnographic
study on cotton farmer suicide reports narratives of surviving Dalit families.
The results reveal that financial and moral debt when accrued within a web of
family and caste-related relationships result in patterns of personal and
familial humiliation, producing a profound sense of hopelessness in the Self.
This loss of hope and pervasive humiliation is 'cultivated' â€‰by a cascade of
decisions taken by others with little or no responsibility to the farmers and the
land they hope to cultivate as they follow different cultural and financial
logic. Suicide resolves the farmers' humiliation and is a logical conclusion to
the farmer's distress, which results from a reconfiguration of agricultural
spaces into socially toxic places, in turn framing a local panopticon. The
current corona virus pandemic is likely to impact adversely on peoples who are
culturally distanced.
