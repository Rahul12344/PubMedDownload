With the whole world being affected by the pandemic, it is a matter of great
importance that studies about spatial and spatio-temporal aspects of the COVID-19
(Sars-Cov-2) pandemic should be conducted, therefore the main goal of this paper 
is to present the Global Moran's I and the Local Moran's I used to evaluate
spatial association in the number of deaths and infections by COVID-19, and a
spatio-temporal Poisson scan statistic used to identify emerging or "alive"
clusters of infections by Sars-Cov-2 in space and time. As of January 2021
vaccination against COVID-19 already started, since the use of spatial clustering
methods to identify non-vaccinated populations is not new among studies on
vaccination coverage strategies, this paper also aims to discuss the
implementation of spatial and spatio-temporal clustering methods in early
vaccination.
