It has been a rough couple of weeks for scientific public relations regarding
COVID-19. Missteps by researchers and funding agencies around the origins of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have provided fodder
for conspiracy theorists, and caveats about the children's vaccine have provided 
more ammo for anti-vaxxers. None of these miscues say anything substantive about 
the science and the conclusion that the virus is almost certainly of zoonotic
origin and that the vaccine is safe for children. But clumsy behavior is more
eye-catching than the details of research, especially when scientists are so
often held to unrealistic standards, expected to be both experts in their fields 
and skilled communicators.
