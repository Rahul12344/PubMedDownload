The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes one of the most dreadful
disease in the history of mankind in the entire world. The covid-19 outbreak
started from Wuhan city of China and then rapidly transmitted throughout the
world causing mass destruction and seldom. This sporadical disease has taken many
lives due to sudden outbreak and no particular vaccines were available at the
early wave. All the vaccines developed are mostly targeted to spike protein of
the virus which involves the encapsulation of mRNA and nanoparticles.
Nanotechnology intervention in fighting against the covid-19 is one way to tackle
the disease from different angles including nano coating mask, nano diagnostic
kits, nano sanitizer, and nano medicine. This article highlights the intervention
of nanotechnology and its possible treatment against the covid-19. It is high
time to come together all the units of material science and biological science to
fight against the dreadful COVID-19. As an alternative strategy, a
multidisciplinary research effort, consisting of classical epidemiology and
clinical methodologies, drugs and nanotechnology, engineering science and
biological apprehension, can be adopted for developing improved drugs exhibiting 
antiviral activities. The employment of nanotechnology and its allied fields can 
be explored to detect, treat, and prevent the covid-19 disease.
