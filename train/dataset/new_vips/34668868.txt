BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the use of forced expiratory volume
in 1 second (FEV1) telemonitoring in pediatric asthma, but a consensus on its
most efficient and effective implementation is still lacking. To find answers, it
is important to study how such an intervention is perceived, experienced, and
used by both patients and health care professionals (HCPs).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide perspectives on how FEV1 home
monitoring should be used in pediatric asthma.
METHODS: This is a qualitative, multicenter, prospective, observational study
which included patients with asthma aged 6-16 and HCPs. Primary outcomes were
results of 2 surveys that were sent to all participants at study start and after 
3-4 months. Secondary outcomes consisted of FEV1 device usage during 4 months
after receiving the FEV1 device.
RESULTS: A total of 39 participants (26 patients and 13 HCPs) were included in
this study. Survey response rates were 97% (38/39) at the start and 87% (34/39)
at the end of the study. Both patients and HCPs were receptive toward online FEV1
home monitoring and found it contributive to asthma control, self-management, and
disease perception. The main concerns were about reliability of the FEV1 device
and validity of home-performed lung function maneuvers. FEV1 devices were used
with a median frequency of 7.5 (IQR 3.3-25.5) during the 4-month study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients and HCPs are receptive toward online FEV1 home monitoring. 
Frequency of measurements varied largely among individuals, yet perceived
benefits remained similar. This emphasizes that online FEV1 home monitoring
strategies should be used as a means to reach individual goals, rather than being
a goal on their own.
