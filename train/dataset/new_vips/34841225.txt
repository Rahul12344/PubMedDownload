CD8 T cells are essential for adaptive immunity against viral infections.
Protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is expressed by CD8 T cells; however, its
role in T cell effector function is not well defined. Here we show that in human 
CD8 T cells, PAR1 stimulation accelerates calcium mobilization. Furthermore, PAR1
is involved in cytotoxic T cell function by facilitating granule trafficking via 
actin polymerization and repositioning of the microtubule organizing center
(MTOC) toward the immunological synapse. In vivo, PAR1-/- mice have reduced
cytokine-producing T cells in response to a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) infection and fail to efficiently control the virus. Specific deletion of 
PAR1 in LCMV GP33-specific CD8 T cells results in reduced expansion and
diminished effector function. These data demonstrate that PAR1 plays a role in
T cell activation and function, and this pathway could represent a new
therapeutic strategy to modulate CD8 T cell effector function.
