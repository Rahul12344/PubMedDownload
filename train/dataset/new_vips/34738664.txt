BACKGROUND: Prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 
and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) are biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
However, their performance in patients with cirrhosis related to hepatitis C
virus (HCV) treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) is unknown.
AIM: To evaluate PIVKA-II and AFP as HCC predictors in DAA-treated patients with 
HCV-related cirrhosis METHODS: In this single centre study, patients with
cirrhosis from chronic HCV infection and with a sustained virological response
(SVR) to DAA were tested for PIVKA-II and AFP (Fujirebio, Japan) at the start of 
DAA treatment (baseline), end of treatment (EOT) and at HCC diagnosis.
RESULTS: We included 400 patients with mean age 65 (24-92); 56% were men. From
baseline to EOT, PIVKA-II did not change (35 vs 35 mAU/mL, P = 0.43) while AFP
significantly decreased (12 vs 6 ng/mL, P < 0.0001). After 52 (3-66) months from 
baseline, 34 (8.5%) patients developed de novo HCC; median AFP 9 (2-12 868) ng/mL
and PIVKA-II 80 (22-1813) mAU/mL. EOT-PIVKA-II (HR 3.05, P < 0.0001) and AFP (HR 
2.77, P = 0.001) independently predicted HCC together with diabetes (HR 6.12,
P < 0.001) and GGT (HR 1.01, P = 0.03). The 4-year cumulative probability of HCC 
was 24% vs 2% in patients with EOT-PIVKA-II > or ≤41 mAU/mL (P < 0.0001), and 26%
vs 9% for EOT-AFP > or ≤15 ng/mL (P = 0.02). By combining EOT-PIVKA-II and AFP,
the 4-year probabilities of HCC were 3% in patients testing negative for both
markers, 18% in patients positive for both, and 38% in patients positive for at
least one (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis treated with DAA, PIVKA-II
and AFP independently predicted HCC, while their combination improved risk
stratification.
