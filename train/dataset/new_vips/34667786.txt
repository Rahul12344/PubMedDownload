BACKGROUND: Social resources help to adapt to stress and might positively affect 
the well-being of individuals with severe conditions like human immunodeficiency 
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The present study
investigates the effect of social support, social capital, and coping in a
positive state of mind of Iranian older people with HIV/AIDS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 160 older
people with HIV referred to AIDS clinics in Tehran in 2019. Samples were randomly
selected from patients aged 50 years and older. Data were collected using a
questionnaire, a positive state of mind, social capital, coping, social support, 
and a checklist of demographical variables. Data analysis was performed using
SPSS software version 21.
RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between social support,
social capital, coping, education, and a positive state of mind. A significant
negative correlation was also found between age, several chronic diseases of the 
patient, and a positive state of mind. The linear regression results showed that 
social support, social capital, coping, and education improved the positive state
of mind.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we believe that social and psychological
interventions effectively enhance patients' positive state of mind with HIV and
ultimately, improve their quality of life.
