Adenovirus vectors offer a platform technology for vaccine development. The value
of the platform has been proven during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although good
stability at 2-8 °C is an advantage of the platform, non-cold-chain distribution 
would have substantial advantages, in particular in low-income countries. We have
previously reported a novel, potentially less expensive thermostabilisation
approach using a combination of simple sugars and glass micro-fibrous matrix,
achieving excellent recovery of adenovirus-vectored vaccines after storage at
temperatures as high as 45 °C. This matrix is, however, prone to fragmentation
and so not suitable for clinical translation. Here, we report an investigation of
alternative fibrous matrices which might be suitable for clinical use. A number
of commercially-available matrices permitted good protein recovery, quality of
sugar glass and moisture content of the dried product but did not achieve the
thermostabilisation performance of the original glass fibre matrix. We therefore 
further investigated physical and chemical characteristics of the glass fibre
matrix and its components, finding that the polyvinyl alcohol present in the
glass fibre matrix assists vaccine stability. This finding enabled us to identify
a potentially biocompatible matrix with encouraging performance. We discuss
remaining challenges for transfer of the technology into clinical use, including 
reliability of process performance.
