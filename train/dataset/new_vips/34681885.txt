SputnikV is a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 developed by the Gamaleya National
Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology. The vaccine has been shown to 
induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, yet the mechanisms remain
largely unknown. Forty SputnikV vaccinated individuals were included in this
study which aimed to demonstrate the location of immunogenic domains of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein using an overlapping peptide library. Additionally,
cytokines in the serum of vaccinated and convalescent COVID-19 patients were
analyzed. We have found antibodies from both vaccinated and convalescent sera
bind to immunogenic regions located in multiple domains of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, 
including Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), N-terminal Domain (NTD), Fusion Protein 
(FP) and Heptad Repeats (HRs). Interestingly, many peptides were recognized by
immunized and convalescent serum antibodies and correspond to conserved regions
in circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. This breadth of reactivity was still
evident 90 days after the first dose of the vaccine, showing that the vaccine has
induced a prolonged response. As evidenced by the activation of T cells, cellular
immunity strongly suggests the high potency of the SputnikV vaccine against
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
