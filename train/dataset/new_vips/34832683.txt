Bluetongue virus (BTV) produces an economically important disease in ruminants of
compulsory notification to the OIE. BTV is typically transmitted by the bite of
Culicoides spp., however, some BTV strains can be transmitted vertically, and
this is associated with fetus malformations and abortions. The viral factors
associated with the virus potency to cross the placental barrier are not well
defined. The potency of vertical transmission is retained and sometimes even
increased in live attenuated BTV vaccine strains. Because BTV possesses a
segmented genome, the possibility of reassortment of vaccination strains with
wild-type virus could even favor the transmission of this phenotype. In the
present review, we will describe the non-vector-based BTV infection routes and
discuss the experimental vaccination strategies that offer advantages over this
drawback of some live attenuated BTV vaccines.
