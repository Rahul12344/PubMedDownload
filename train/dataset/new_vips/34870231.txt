Introduction: Adults with underlying medical disorders are at increased risk for 
severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. This study aimed to compare
the effect of underlying diseases on the mortality of male and female patients as
a primary objective. We also evaluated the effect of drugs previously used by
COVID-19 patients on their outcome.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study was carried out on confirmed cases of
COVID-19 who were admitted to a teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran. Data was
gathered from patients' files. Log binomial model was used for investigating the 
association of underlying diseases and in-hospital mortality of these patients.
Results: A total of 991 patients (mean age 61.62±17.02; 54.9% male) were
recruited. Hypertension (41.1%), diabetes mellitus (30.6%), and coronary artery
disease (19.6%) were the most common underlying diseases. The multivariable model
showed that hypertension (RR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.22-2.14, p = 0.001) in male
patients over 55 years old and coronary artery disease (RR = 2.40; 95% CI:
1.24-4.46, p = 0.009) in female patients under 65 years old were risk factors of 
mortality. In females over 65 years old, the history of taking Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) (RR =
0.272; 95% CI: 0.17-0.41, p = 0.001) was a significant protective factor for
death.
Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases such as 
hypertension and coronary artery disease, especially those in specific age and
sex groups, are high-risk patients for in-hospital mortality. Additionally, a
previous history of taking ACEi and ARB medications in females over 65 tears old 
was a protective factor against in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients.
