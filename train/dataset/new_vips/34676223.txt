Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common contributor to chronic hepatitis,
liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 10% of people with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also have chronic HBV co-infection, owing to
shared transmission routes. HIV/HBV coinfection accelerates the progression of
chronic HBV to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma
compared to chronic HBV mono-infection. HBV/HIV coinfection alters the natural
history of hepatitis B and renders the antiviral treatment more complex. In this 
report, we conducted a critical review on the epidemiology, natural history, and 
pathogenesis of liver diseases related to HBV/HIV coinfection. We summarized the 
novel therapeutic options for these coinfected patients.
