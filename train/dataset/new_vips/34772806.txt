Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a hallmark viral material that activates antiviral
interferon (IFN) responses, can appear in human cells also in the absence of
viruses. We identify phosphorothioate DNAs (PS DNAs) as triggers of such
endogenous dsRNA (endo-dsRNA). PS DNAs inhibit decay of nuclear RNAs and induce
endo-dsRNA via accumulation of high levels of intronic and intergenic inverted
retroelements (IIIR). IIIRs activate endo-dsRNA responses distinct from antiviral
defense programs. IIIRs do not turn on transcriptional RIG-I/MDA5/IFN signaling, 
but they trigger the dsRNA-sensing pathways of OAS3/RNase L and PKR. Thus,
nuclear RNA decay and nuclear-cytosolic RNA sorting actively protect from these
innate immune responses to self. Our data suggest that the OAS3/RNase L and PKR
arms of innate immunity diverge from antiviral IFN responses and monitor nuclear 
RNA decay by sensing cytosolic escape of IIIRs. OAS3 provides a receptor for
IIIRs, whereas RNase L cleaves IIIR-carrying introns and intergenic RNAs.
