DNA replication is an integral step in the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
life cycle that is coordinated with the cellular DNA damage response, repair and 
recombination of the viral genome, and viral gene transcription. HSV-1 encodes
its own DNA replication machinery, including an origin binding protein (UL9),
single-stranded DNA binding protein (ICP8), DNA polymerase (UL30), processivity
factor (UL42), and a helicase/primase complex (UL5/UL8/UL52). In addition, HSV-1 
utilizes a combination of accessory viral and cellular factors to coordinate
viral DNA replication with other viral and cellular processes. The purpose of
this review is to outline the roles of viral and cellular proteins in HSV-1 DNA
replication and replication-coupled processes, and to highlight how HSV-1 may
modify and adapt cellular proteins to facilitate productive infection.
