Since the coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019, several antibody therapeutics
have been developed to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infections. Antibody therapeutics are effective in neutralizing the 
virus and reducing hospitalization in patients with mild and moderate infections.
These therapeutics target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2; however, emerging
mutations in this protein reduce their efficiency. In this study, we developed a 
universal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody. We generated a humanized monoclonal
antibody, MG1141A, against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein
through traditional mouse immunization. We confirmed that MG1141A could
effectively neutralize live viruses, with an EC50 of 92 pM, and that it exhibited
effective Fc-mediated functions. Additionally, it retained its neutralizing
activity against the alpha (UK), beta (South Africa), and gamma (Brazil) variants
of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our study contributes to the development of a
novel antibody therapeutic approach, which can effectively combat emerging
SARS-CoV-2 mutations.
