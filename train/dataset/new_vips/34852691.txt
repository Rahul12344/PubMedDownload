BACKGROUND: HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have
disproportionately affected communities of men who have sex with men (MSM). We
describe HIV and STI prevalence and testing patterns among urban Vietnamese MSM.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional community-based study of MSM in Hanoi,
Vietnam in 2016. Participants self-reported experiences of social stigma in
healthcare settings and previous HIV and STI testing. STI testing included HIV,
herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.
RESULTS: 205 MSM participated in the study. STI prevalence was HIV (10%), HSV-2
(4%), syphilis (13%), gonorrhea (34%), and chlamydia (19%). More than half (55%) 
of participants tested positive for at least one STI. Most participants had been 
previously tested for HIV or another STI (72%), with 24% previously receiving a
positive result. Perceived and enacted social stigma in healthcare contexts was
negatively associated with previous HIV or STI testing (adjusted prevalence odds 
ratio (aPOR): 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10-0.48).
DISCUSSION: High prevalence of STIs was observed among Vietnamese MSM, and
perceived and enacted stigma was related to HIV and STI testing. Our findings
reaffirm the importance of regular STI screening among this population as well as
additional outreach to promote safe HIV and STI healthcare engagement.
