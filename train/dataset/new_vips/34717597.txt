BACKGROUND: Adaptation, a form of modification that aims to improve an
intervention's acceptability and sustainability in each context, is essential to 
successful implementation in some settings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
clinicians have rapidly adapted how they deliver patient care. PPE Portraits are 
a form of adaptation, whereby health workers affix a postcard size portrait of
themselves to the front of their personal protective equipment (PPE) to foster
human connection during COVID-19.
METHODS: We used the expanded framework for reporting adaptations and
modifications to evidence-based interventions (FRAME) method to better understand
the reasoning behind and results of each adaptation. We hypothesized that using
the FRAME in conjunction with design-thinking would lead to emerging best
practices and that we would find adaptation similarities across sites. Throughout
multiple implementations across 25 institutions, we piloted, tracked, and
analyzed adaptations using FRAME and design thinking. For each adaptation, we
assessed the stage of implementation, whether the change was planned, decision
makers involved, level of delivery impacted, fidelity to original intervention,
and the goal and reasoning for adaptation. We added three crucial components to
the FRAME: original purpose of the adaptation, unintended consequences, and
alternative adaptations.
RESULTS: When implementing PPE Portraits across settings, from a local assisted
living center's memory unit to a pediatric emergency department, several requests
for adaptations arose during early development stages before implementation.
Adaptations primarily related to (1) provider convenience and comfort, (2)
patient populations, and (3) scale. Providers preferred smaller portraits and
rounded (rather than square) laminated edges that could potentially injure a
patient. Affixing the portrait with a magnet was rejected given the potential
choking hazard the magnetic strip presented for children. Other adaptations,
related to ease of dissemination, included slowing the process down during early 
development and providing buttons, which could be produced easily at scale.
CONCLUSIONS: The FRAME was used to curate the reasoning for each adaptation and
to inform future dissemination. We look forward to utilizing FRAME including our 
additions and design thinking, to build out a range of PPE Portrait best
practices with accompanying costs and benefits.
