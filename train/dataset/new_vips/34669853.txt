OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to build a prediction model to discriminate 
precociously hantavirus infection from leptospirosis, identifying the conditions 
and risk factors associated with these diseases.
METHODS: A logistic regression model in which the response variable was the
presence of hantavirus or leptospirosis was adjusted.
RESULTS: As a result, the method selected the following variables that influenced
the prediction formula: sociodemographic variables, clinical manifestations, and 
exposure to environmental risks. All variables considered in the model presented 
statistical significance with a p<0.05 value. The accuracy of the model to
differentiate hantavirus from leptospirosis was 88.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Concluding that the development of statistical tools with high
potential to predict the disease, and thus differentiate them precociously, can
reduce hospital costs, speed up the patient's care, reduce morbidity and
mortality, and assist health professionals and public managers in
decision-making.
