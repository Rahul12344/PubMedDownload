Vacuoles, E1, X-linked, autoimmunity, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is characterized
by a pathogenic mutation in UBA1, which leads to protean complications including 
autoimmunity and myelodysplasia. A 56-year-old man with steroid-dependent, later 
steroid-refractory cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa and Sweet syndrome developed
recurrent daily fever, macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute hypoxic
respiratory failure, and anasarca. He was eventually diagnosed with Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) viremia and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). He improved
clinically with rituximab, ruxolitinib, and increased glucocorticoids before
expiring from Pseudomonas sepsis. UBA1 exon 3 mutational analysis in myeloid
enriched peripheral blood revealed a c.122T>C (p.Met41Thr) pathogenic variant,
consistent with VEXAS syndrome. We describe the first case of EBV-associated HLH 
in a patient diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome. Early identification of this syndrome
will be important in order to offer potential therapies before life-threatening
complications arise.
