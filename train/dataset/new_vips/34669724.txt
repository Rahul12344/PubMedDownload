During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. conservative politicians 
and the media downplayed the risk of both contracting COVID-19 and the
effectiveness of recommended health behaviors. Health behavior theories suggest
perceived vulnerability to a health threat and perceived effectiveness of
recommended health-protective behaviors determine motivation to follow
recommendations. Accordingly, we predicted that-as a result of politicization of 
the pandemic-politically conservative Americans would be less likely to enact
recommended health-protective behaviors. In two longitudinal studies of U.S.
residents, political conservatism was inversely associated with perceived health 
risk and adoption of health-protective behaviors over time. The effects of
political orientation on health-protective behaviors were mediated by perceived
risk of infection, perceived severity of infection, and perceived effectiveness
of the health-protective behaviors. In a global cross-national analysis, effects 
were stronger in the U.S. (N = 10,923) than in an international sample (total N =
51,986), highlighting the increased and overt politicization of health behaviors 
in the U.S.
