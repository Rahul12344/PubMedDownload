Brain inflammation generally accompanies and accelerates neurodegeneration. Here 
we report a microglial mechanism in which polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1)
senses extrinsic tau 3R/4R proteins by direct interaction and triggers an innate 
immune response by activating a cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Stimulator of
interferon genes (STING) pathway. Tamoxifen-inducible and microglia-specific
depletion of PQBP1 in primary culture in vitro and mouse brain in vivo shows that
PQBP1 is essential for sensing-tau to induce nuclear translocation of nuclear
factor κB (NFκB), NFκB-dependent transcription of inflammation genes, brain
inflammation in vivo, and eventually mouse cognitive impairment. Collectively,
PQBP1 is an intracellular receptor in the cGAS-STING pathway not only for cDNA of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but also for the transmissible
neurodegenerative disease protein tau. This study characterises a mechanism of
brain inflammation that is common to virus infection and neurodegenerative
disorders.
