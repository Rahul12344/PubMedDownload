As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread at an unprecedented rate, many
universities around the world halted physical forms of teaching and learning to
stop the spread of the virus. As a result, many university students were forced
to utilize online learning through channels such as mobile social media. Due to
the novelty of this situation, there are many unknowns particularly with the
negative influences of mobile learning via social media on university students.
Thus, this study looks to examine this subject matter from the perspective of the
stimulus-organism-response theory. The uniquely developed research model included
four stimuli (i.e., social overload, information overload, life invasion, and
privacy invasion), two organisms (i.e., technostress and exhaustion) as well as a
response in terms of reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media.
The responses were collected from 384 university students via an online survey
and analyzed with the Partial-Least-Square-Structural-Equation-Modelling. It was 
found that the antecedents for both technostress and exhaustion were able to
account for more than half of their respective variances. Furthermore,
technostress and exhaustion were significant facilitators of the students'
reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. In addition to the
practical insights for stakeholders in the education industry, this study also
posited several theoretical implications for researchers.
