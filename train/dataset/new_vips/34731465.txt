The development of vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 is paving the way for
new hope. Despite this, the risk of the virus mutating into a vaccine-resistant
variant still persists. As a result, the demand of efficacious drugs to treat
COVID-19 is still pertinent. To this end, scientists continue to identify and
repurpose marketed drugs for this new disease. Many of these drugs are currently 
undergoing clinical trials and, so far, only one has been officially approved by 
FDA. Drug repurposing is a much faster route to the clinic than standard drug
development of novel molecules, nevertheless in a pandemic this process is still 
not fast enough to halt the spread of the virus. Artificial intelligence has
already played a large part in hastening the drug discovery process, not only by 
facilitating the selection of potential drug candidates but also in monitoring
the pandemic and enabling faster diagnosis of patients. In this chapter, we focus
on the impact and challenges that artificial intelligence has demonstrated thus
far with respect to drug repurposing of therapeutics for the treatment of
COVID-19.
