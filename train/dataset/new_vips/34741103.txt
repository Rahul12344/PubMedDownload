Group A rotaviruses (RVA) remain a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea worldwide,
in part due to underperformance of currently approved live-attenuated, oral
vaccines in low-and-middle income countries. Improved immune correlates of
protection (CoP) for existing oral vaccines and novel strategies to evaluate the 
performance of next-generation vaccines are needed. Use of oral vaccines as
challenge agents in controlled human infection models is a potential approach to 
CoP discovery that remains underexplored. In a live-attenuated, oral rotavirus
vaccine (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline) efficacy trial conducted among infants in
Dhaka, Bangladesh, we explored the potential for the second dose of the two-dose 
series to be considered a challenge agent through which RVA immunity could be
explored, using fecal virus shedding post-dose 2 as a marker of mucosal immunity.
Among 180 vaccinated infants who completed the parent study per protocol, the
absence of fecal vaccine shedding following the second dose of Rotarix suggested 
intestinal mucosal immunity generated by the first dose and a decreased risk of
RVA diarrhea through 2 years of life (RR 0.616, 95% CI 0.392-0.968). Further
development of controlled human infection models for group A rotaviruses,
especially in prospective studies with larger sample sizes, may be a promising
tool to assess rotavirus vaccine efficacy and CoPs.
