Objective: The objective of this article is to report a rare case of
glucocorticoid hypersensitivity syndrome, which may be associated with an
underlying rubella virus infection.
Case Report: A 29-year-old man showed progressive weight gain for 16 months
accompanied by a moon face, enlarged dorsocervical fat pad, central obesity, and 
purple striae. His cortisol circadian rhythm was normal, and plasma cortisol
levels at 8:00 AM fluctuated between 3.2 and 9.54 μg/dL (reference range,
4.3-22.4 μg/dL). A dexamethasone suppression test with a very low dose (0.25 mg) 
of dexamethasone showed a marked decrease in plasma cortisol level to 0 μg/dL.
Adrenal computed tomography and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging findings
were normal. The Z-score of the bone density in the lumbar spine was -4.2. The
IgM antibody for the rubella virus was positive. His erythrocyte sedimentation
rate was 24 mm/hour (reference range, <15 mm/hour), and the C-reactive protein
level was 9.22 mg/L (reference range, <5 mg/L). After 3 months, his symptoms
resolved spontaneously. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein
level returned to normal. The IgM antibody for the rubella virus turned negative,
whereas the IgG antibody for the rubella virus was positive.
Discussion: According to the paradox between clinical manifestations and
laboratory tests exogenous Cushing syndrome, cyclical Cushing syndrome, and
glucocorticoid hypersensitivity syndrome all should be considered in the
diagnosis. Detailed medical history inquiry, complete endocrine hormone testing, 
and continuous follow-up are all critical for diagnosis.
Conclusion: Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with glucocorticoid
hypersensitivity syndrome. This case illustrates the need to consider the
possibility of glucocorticoid hypersensitivity syndrome in a patient who has the 
manifestations of Cushing syndrome but paradoxical hypocortisolemia, especially
after rubella virus infection.
