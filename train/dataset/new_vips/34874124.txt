SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(hACE2), allowing virus to dock on cell membrane follow by viral entry. Here, we 
use high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) for real-time visualization of S,
and its interaction with hACE2 and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Results
show conformational heterogeneity of S, flexibility of S stalk and
receptor-binding domain (RBD), and pH/temperature-induced conformational change
of S. S in an S-ACE2 complex appears as an all-RBD up conformation. The complex
acquires a distinct topology upon acidification. S and S2 subunit demonstrate
different membrane docking mechanisms on sEVs. S-hACE2 interaction facilitates S 
to dock on sEVs, implying the feasibility of ACE2-expressing sEVs for viral
neutralization. In contrary, S2 subunit docks on lipid layer and enters sEV using
its fusion peptide, mimicking the viral entry scenario. Altogether, our study
provides a platform that is suitable for real-time visualization of various entry
inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and sEV-based decoy in blocking viral entry.
Teaser: Comprehensive observation of SARS-CoV-2 spike and its interaction with
receptor ACE2 and sEV-based decoy in real time using HS-AFM.
