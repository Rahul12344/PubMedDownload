We performed a 2-year prospective cohort study to determine the incidence of
dengue in Angoda, Colombo district, Sri Lanka (NCT02570152). The primary
objective was to determine the incidence of acute febrile illness (AFI) because
of laboratory confirmed dengue (LCD). Secondary objectives were to determine AFI 
incidence due to non-LCD, describe AFI symptoms, and estimate AFI incidence
because of LCD by dengue virus (DENV)-type and age group. Participants from
households with at least one minor and one adult (≤50 years) were enrolled and
followed with scheduled weekly visits and, in case of AFI, unscheduled visits.
Blood was collected for DENV detection at AFI visits, and symptoms recorded
during the 7-day period following AFI onset. A total of 2,004 participants were
enrolled (971 children, and 1,033 adults). A total of 55 LCD episodes were
detected (overall incidence of 14.2 per 1,000 person-years). Incidence was the
highest among children < 5 years (21.3 per 1,000 person-years) and 5-11 years
(22.7 per 1,000 person-years), compared with adults ≥ 18 years (9.2 per 1,000
person-years). LCD was mostly (83.6%) caused by DENV-2 (N = 46), followed by
DENV-1 (N = 6) and DENV-3 (N = 3). Common symptoms of LCD were headache, fatigue,
myalgia, loss of appetite, and arthralgia. Incidence of AFI because of non-LCD
was 47.3 per 1,000 person-years. In conclusion, this study reports the LCD
incidence for a DENV-2 dominated epidemic that is comparable to the incidence of 
suspected dengue reported passively for 2017, one of the worst outbreaks in
recent history.
