We exploited a multi-scale microscopy imaging toolbox to address some major
issues related to SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host cells. Our approach harnesses
both conventional and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and easily matches
the spatial scale of single-virus/cell checkpoints. After its validation through 
the characterization of infected cells and virus morphology, we leveraged this
toolbox to reveal subtle issues related to the entry phase of SARS-CoV-2 variants
in Vero E6 cells. Our results show that in Vero E6 cells the B.1.1.7 strain (aka 
Alpha Variant of Concern) is associated with much faster kinetics of endocytic
uptake compared to its ancestor B.1.177. Given the cell-entry scenario dominated 
by the endosomal "late pathway", the faster internalization of B.1.1.7 could be
directly related to the N501Y mutation in the S protein, which is known to
strengthen the binding of Spike receptor binding domain with ACE2. Remarkably, we
also directly observed the central role of clathrin as a mediator of endocytosis 
in the late pathway of entry. In keeping with the clathrin-mediated endocytosis, 
we highlighted the non-raft membrane localization of ACE2. Overall, we believe
that our fluorescence microscopy-based approach represents a fertile strategy to 
investigate the molecular features of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with cells.
