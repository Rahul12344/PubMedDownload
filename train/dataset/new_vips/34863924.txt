X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disease
caused by mutations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, characterized by 
recurrent infections and low or undetectable immunoglobulin levels. The most
recommended treatment for XLA is lifelong intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
replacement therapy. Without treatment, XLA patients are vulnerable to bacterial 
and viral infections. Meningoencephalitis is a common complication in patients
with XLA. Torque Teno viruses (TTV) are ubiquitous in the various tissues of
healthy people. TTV infections have been reported recently. This case study
presents the first reported case of meningoencephalitis in an adult male with XLA
most likely caused by TTV in the Chinese mainland. A 27-year-old male presented
with fever and severe disturbance of consciousness. Conventional tests, including
blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, did not reveal any bacterial
infections. The clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings and results of CSF
were suggestive of viral meningoencephalitis. Then, TTV was detected in CSF by
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology. This case highlights TTV may have a 
pathogenic effect on patients with severe immunodeficiency disease and can
produce severe clinical symptoms.
