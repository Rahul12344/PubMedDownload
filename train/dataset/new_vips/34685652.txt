Autophagy is a fundamental catabolic process essential for the maintenance of
cellular and tissue homeostasis, as well as directly contributing to the control 
of invading pathogens. Unsurprisingly, this process becomes critical in
supporting cellular dysregulation that occurs in cancer, particularly the tumor
microenvironments and their immune cell infiltration, ultimately playing a role
in responses to cancer therapies. Therefore, understanding "cancer autophagy"
could help turn this cellular waste-management service into a powerful ally for
specific therapeutics. For instance, numerous regulatory mechanisms of the
autophagic machinery can contribute to the anti-tumor properties of oncolytic
viruses (OVs), which comprise a diverse class of replication-competent viruses
with potential as cancer immunotherapeutics. In that context, autophagy can
either: promote OV anti-tumor effects by enhancing infectivity and replication,
mediating oncolysis, and inducing autophagic and immunogenic cell death; or
reduce OV cytotoxicity by providing survival cues to tumor cells. These
properties make the catabolic process of autophagy an attractive target for
therapeutic combinations looking to enhance the efficacy of OVs. In this article,
we review the complicated role of autophagy in cancer initiation and development,
its effect on modulating OVs and immunity, and we discuss recent progress and
opportunities/challenges in targeting autophagy to enhance oncolytic viral
immunotherapy.
