Introduction: Direct antiviral agents (DAAs) are new drugs for the treatment of
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. These drugs are very effective and
well tolerated. HCV can cause liver disease as well as extrahepatic
manifestations, including a profound negative impact on health-related quality of
life (HRQL).
Aim of the study: To evaluate HRQL in the long term (> 6 months after finishing
treatment) after successful treatment with DAAs. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study that evaluates quality of life in the long term after DAA
treatment.
Material and methods: This is an observational study which included 100 patients 
treated with DAAs for chronic HCV infection between January 2015 and August 2018.
Patients were assigned randomly. The average time after finishing treatment was
29.96 months. The Liver Disease Symptom Index (LDSI) 2.0 Questionnaire was used
to evaluate quality of life before and after treatment.
Results: Seven of 9 parameters of the LDSI 2.0 Questionnaire showed significant
improvement in the long term after successful treatment with DAAs. Two parameters
(arthralgia and jaundice) did not improve significantly. Quality of life improved
in both males and females similarly. Improvement did not correlate with the
severity of liver fibrosis.
Conclusions: Treatment with DAAs improves HRQL significantly in the long term.
