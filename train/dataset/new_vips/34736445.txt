BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, traditional emergency
management measures are facing many practical limitations. The application of big
data analysis technology provides an opportunity for local governments to conduct
the COVID-19 epidemic emergency management more scientifically. The present
study, based on emergency management lifecycle theory, includes a comprehensive
analysis of the application framework of China's SARS epidemic emergency
management lacked the support of big data technology in 2003. In contrast, this
study first proposes a more agile and efficient application framework, supported 
by big data technology, for the COVID-19 epidemic emergency management and then
analyses the differences between the two frameworks.
METHODS: This study takes Hainan Province, China as its case study by using a
file content analysis and semistructured interviews to systematically comprehend 
the strategy and mechanism of Hainan's application of big data technology in its 
COVID-19 epidemic emergency management.
RESULTS: Hainan Province adopted big data technology during the four stages,
i.e., migration, preparedness, response, and recovery, of its COVID-19 epidemic
emergency management. Hainan Province developed advanced big data management
mechanisms and technologies for practical epidemic emergency management, thereby 
verifying the feasibility and value of the big data technology application
framework we propose.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence for certain aspects of the
theory, mechanism, and technology for local governments in different countries
and regions to apply, in a precise, agile, and evidence-based manner, big data
technology in their formulations of comprehensive COVID-19 epidemic emergency
management strategies.
