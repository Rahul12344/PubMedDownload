Rhombencephalitis is a rare condition, often caused by infection, commonly
presenting with myoclonic jerks, ataxia and cranial nerve palsy. Typically, it
has a high morbidity and mortality, with worse prognosis associated with
cardiopulmonary involvement. Herein, we present the case of a 10-year-old boy,
presenting with headache, vomiting, symptomatic bradycardia and rapidly
progressing ophthalmoplegia from a sixth nerve palsy, without additional
brainstem symptoms. Previously, pericarditis, myocarditis and heart failure have 
been associated with rhombencephalitis, but not bradycardia. The cause of his
rhombencephalitis was presumed viral, but despite extensive screening, the virus 
responsible was never isolated. Following treatment with intravenous antibiotics 
and antivirals in a high dependency unit, he recovered well with no neurological 
deficit on discharge and marked radiological improvement on MRI 4 weeks later.
Although rare, rhombencephalitis should be considered in a child presenting with 
neurological symptoms, particularly alongside a cranial nerve palsy, developing
over a rapid time course.
