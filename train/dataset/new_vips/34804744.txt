A previously independent 83-year-old lady presents with acute confusion,
decreased mobility, urinary retention, and constipation, having recently received
a course of oral acyclovir for shingles. The patient was noted to have extensive 
bruising to her upper limbs, and blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers
with low platelet count, although this remained above 75 × 109/L. Her confusion
on a background of shingles raised the differential diagnosis of varicella-zoster
virus (VZV) encephalitis. CT head and MRI brain showed no acute intracranial
abnormality. Lumbar puncture yielded frankly haemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), but viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was negative for the
varicella-zoster virus. She later developed further right shoulder pain and right
lower limb weakness three days post-initial lumbar puncture. Repeat CT head was
unremarkable. MRI spine showed extensive spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage, with
possible cervical arteriovenous malformation and L5/S1 spinal nerve compression. 
The patient was managed conservatively with dexamethasone and inpatient
physiotherapy support. She was discharged after a long hospital stay at a new
mobility baseline requiring hoist transfers.
