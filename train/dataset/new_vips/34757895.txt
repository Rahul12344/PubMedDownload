We conducted a second nationwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
seroprevalence study in the Faroe Islands during November 2020. We found crude
seroprevalence was 0.3% and prevalence was 0.4% after adjusting for test
sensitivity and specificity. This low seroprevalence supports the prevention
strategies used in the Faroe Islands.
