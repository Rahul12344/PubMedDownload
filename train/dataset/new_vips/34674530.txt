Antibodies from previous infection bring sufficient and long-term protection
against COVID-19.

One of the basic manifestations of an adaptive anti-infective immunity is the
production of specific antibodies. The presence of antibodies can be detected in 
serum and serves as one of the diagnostic tools used to confirm past infection.
Very often it also serves as a confirmation that the body has acquired immunity
to the disease. The appearance of COVID-19 has cast a shadow of doubt on these
textbook examples of antibody behavior. Information that repeatedly questions
antibody measurement and its significance has been circulating among
professionals and the general public. The aim of our article is to summarize the 
current knowledge on the immunity acquired following SARS-CoV-2 infection and to 
present the results of antibody testing from four Czech laboratories which have
been measuring these antibodies for over one year. Our data suggest that commonly
available diagnostic methods reliably predict the results of a virus
neutralization test, which is the gold standard of immunity detection. By
acknowledging those with naturally acquired anti-infective immunity, in addition 
to vaccinated individuals, we will significantly increase the perceived level of 
collective immunity.
