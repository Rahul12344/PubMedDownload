This manuscript describes the potentially significant role of interfacial tension
in viral infection. Our hypothesis is based on evidence from drop coalescence
hydrodynamics. A change in membrane tension can trigger fusion between the
vesicle and cell such that genetic material, like viral RNA, can subsequently be 
transported to the cell interior. In other cases, RNA may reside near the cell
membrane inside the cell, which could make their removal energetically
unfavorable because of hydrodynamic interactions between membrane and RNA.
Interfacial tension of the virus membrane can be modulated by temperature, among 
many other factors, of the mucosa layer. We discuss our hypothesis within the
scope of recent SARS-CoV-2 studies where temperature-dependent membrane surface
tension could be impacted through different atmospheric conditions, air
conditioning systems, and the use of masks.
