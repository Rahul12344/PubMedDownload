BACKGROUND: Only a few studies have studied the link between risk perception and 
sleep in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of our study is to
propose and test a theoretical model to understand the relationships between
COVID-19 risk appraisals-risk perception and perception of collective coordinated
defense (PCCD) in particular-and subjective sleep quality in Chinese adults in
Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-related fear and rumination were
examined as potential mediators of the relationships.
METHODS: Data were collected using a self-report online questionnaire from a
convenience sample of 224 Chinese adults during the fourth wave of the COVID-19
pandemic in Hong Kong.
RESULTS: Risk perception and PCCD were found to predict poor sleep quality.
Mediation analysis showed that both fear and rumination mediated the relationship
between risk perception and sleep quality, whereas only fear mediated the
relationship between PCCD and sleep quality. The model was an excellent fit to
the data and accounted for 44% of the variance in sleep quality in Chinese
adults. This study indicated that both perception of high risks of contracting
COVID-19 and anticipations of collective disease preventive efforts had adverse
effects on subjective sleep quality via increasing COVID-19-related fear.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for addressing sleep problems
induced by psychological consequences of the pandemic. While policy makers often 
deliver public messaging campaigns that frame disease prevention as a collective 
goal, developing evidence-based coping strategies to combat COVID-19 adverse
impacts on psychological health is equally important.
