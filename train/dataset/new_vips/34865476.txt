The COVID-19 pandemic is having a major impact on public health worldwide, and
there is an urgent need for the creation of an armamentarium of effective
therapeutics, including vaccines, biologics, and small-molecule therapeutics, to 
combat SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants. Inspection of the virus life cycle
reveals multiple viral- and host-based choke points that can be exploited to
combat the virus. SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro), an enzyme essential for
viral replication, is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, and the 
design of inhibitors of the protease may lead to the emergence of effective
SARS-CoV-2-specific antivirals. We describe herein the results of our studies
related to the application of X-ray crystallography, the Thorpe-Ingold effect,
deuteration, and stereochemistry in the design of highly potent and nontoxic
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
