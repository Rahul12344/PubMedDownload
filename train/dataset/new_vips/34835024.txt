Steve Oroszlan determined the sequences at the ends of virion proteins for a
number of different retroviruses. This work led to the insight that the
amino-terminal amino acid of the mature viral CA protein is always proline. In
this remembrance, we review Steve's work that led to this insight and show how
that insight was a necessary precursor to the work we have done in the subsequent
years exploring the cleavage rate determinants of viral protease processing sites
and the multiple roles the amino-terminal proline of CA plays after protease
cleavage liberates it from its position in a protease processing site.
