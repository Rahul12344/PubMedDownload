As of the beginning of March 2021, Israeli law requires the presentation of a
Green Pass as a precondition for entering certain businesses and public spheres. 
Entitlement for a Green Pass is granted to Israelis who have been vaccinated with
two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, who have recovered from COVID-19, or who are
participating in a clinical trial for vaccine development in Israel. The Green
Pass is essential for retaining immune individuals' freedom of movement and for
promoting the public interest in reopening the economic, educational, and
cultural spheres of activity. Nonetheless, and as the Green Pass imposes
restrictions on the movement of individuals who had not been vaccinated or who
had not recovered, it is not consonant with solidarity and trust building.
Implementing the Green Pass provision while advancing its effectiveness on the
one hand, and safeguarding equality, proportionality, and fairness on the other
hand may imbue this measure with ethical legitimacy despite involving a potential
breach of trust and solidarity.
