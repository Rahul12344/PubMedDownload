PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will comment on the current knowledge for the
diagnosis of the main causes of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal disease
(IFD); it will discuss the optimal strategies and limitations and wherever
available, will describe international recommendations.
RECENT FINDINGS: A range of secondary IFDs complicating COVID-19 infection have
been described and while COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was
predicted, the presentation of significant numbers of COVID-19-associated
candidosis and COVID-19-associated mucormycosis was somewhat unexpected. Given
the range of IFDs and prolonged duration of risk, diagnostic strategies need to
involve multiple tests for detecting and differentiating various causes of IFD.
Although performance data for a range of tests to diagnose COVID-19-associated
pulmonary aspergillosis is emerging, the performance of tests to diagnose other
IFD is unknown or based on pre-COVID performance data.
SUMMARY: Because of the vast numbers of COVID-19 infections, IFD in COVID-19
critical-care patients represents a significant burden of disease, even if
incidences are less than 5%. Optimal diagnosis of COVID-19-associated IFD
requires a strategic approach. The pandemic has highlighted the potential impact 
of IFD outside of the typical high-risk clinical cohorts, given the
ever-increasing population at risk of IFD and enhanced surveillance of fungal
infections is required.
