Specific guanine rich nucleic acid sequences can form non-canonical structures,
like the four stranded G-quadruplex (GQ). We studied the GQ-forming sequence
(named HepB) found in the genome of the hepatitis B virus. Fluorescence-,
infrared- and CD-spectroscopy were used. HepB shows a hybrid form in presence of 
K+, but Na+, Li+, and Rb+ induce parallel structure. Higher concentrations of
metal ions increase the unfolding temperature, which was explained by a short
thermodynamic calculation. Temperature stability of the GQ structure was
determined for all these ions. Na+ has stronger stabilizing effect on HepB than
K+, which is highly unusual. The transition temperatures were 56.6, 53.8, 58.5
and 54.4 °C for Na+, K+, Li+, and Rb+ respectively. Binding constants for Na+ and
K+ were 10.2 mM and 7.1 mM respectively. Study of three ligands designed in
cancer research for GQ targeting (TMPyP4, BRACO19 and PhenDC3) showed
unequivocally their binding to HepB. Binding was proven by the increased
stability of the bound form. The stabilization was higher than 20 °C for TMPyP4
and PhenDC3, while it was considerably lower for BRACO19. These results might
have medical importance in the fight against the hepatitis B virus.
