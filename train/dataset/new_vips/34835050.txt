Following the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in Latin America,
ZIKV has emerged as a global health threat due to its ability to induce
neurological disease in both adults and the developing fetus. ZIKV is largely
mosquito-borne and is now endemic in many parts of Africa, Asia, and South
America. However, several reports have demonstrated persistent ZIKV infection of 
the male reproductive tract and evidence of male-to-female sexual transmission of
ZIKV. Sexual transmission may broaden the reach of ZIKV infections beyond its
current geographical limits, presenting a significant threat worldwide. Several
mouse models of ZIKV infection have been developed to investigate ZIKV
pathogenesis and develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. However, the
majority of these models focus on mosquito-borne infection, while few have
considered the impact of sexual transmission on immunity and pathogenesis. This
review will examine the advantages and disadvantages of current models of
mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted ZIKV and provide recommendations for the 
effective use of ZIKV mouse models.
