Background: To date, cases of extraintestinal micro-sporidiosis have been
increasingly reported in both otherwise healthy and immunocompromised
individuals. Among them, microsporidial myositis is very rare. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of microsporidial myositis caused by
Trachipleistophora hominis in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
in Thailand.
Case report: A Thai man with HIV presented with fever and muscle pain at both
anterior thighs and left arm for 3 months. Muscle biopsy was performed, and
pathology exhibited neutrophil infiltration and focal aggregations of
microsporidial spores. The 18S ribosomal RNA sequence revealed the species of
this microsporidium as T hominis, and albendazole of 800mg/day was initiated. He 
gradually improved, and was discharged home 6 weeks after hospitalization.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
microsporidial myositis caused by Trachipleistophora hominis in a person with HIV
in Thailand.
