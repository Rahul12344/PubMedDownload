Ecological interactions between wild aquatic birds and outdoor-housed poultry can
enhance spillover events of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) from wild reservoirs
to domestic birds, thus increasing the related zoonotic risk to occupationally
exposed workers. To assess serological evidence of AIV infection in workers
operating in Northern Italy at the wildfowl/poultry interface or directly exposed
to wildfowl, serum samples were collected between April 2005 and November 2006
from 57 bird-exposed workers (BEWs) and from 7 unexposed controls (Cs), planning 
three sample collections from each individual. Concurrently, AIV surveillance of 
3587 reared birds identified 4 AIVs belonging to H10N7, H4N6 and H2N2 subtypes
while serological analysis by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay showed
recent infections caused by H1, H2, H4, H6, H10, H11, H12, and H13 subtypes.
Human sera were analyzed for specific antibodies against AIVs belonging to
antigenic subtypes from H1 to H14 by using HI and virus microneutralization (MN) 
assays as a screening and a confirmatory test, respectively. Overall, antibodies 
specific to AIV-H3, AIV-H6, AIV-H8, and AIV-H9 were found in three poultry
workers (PWs) and seropositivity to AIV-11, AIV-H13-still detectable in October
2017-in one wildlife professional (WP). Furthermore, seropositivity to AIV-H2,
accounting for previous exposure to the "extinct" H2N2 human influenza viruses,
was found in both BEWs and Cs groups. These data further emphasize the
occupational risk posed by zoonotic AIV strains and show the possible occurrence 
of long-lived antibody-based immunity following AIV infections in humans.
