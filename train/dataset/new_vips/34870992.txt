Most enveloped viruses rely on the host cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality
control (QC) machinery for proper folding of glycoproteins. The key ER
α-glucosidases (α-Glu) I and II of the ERQC machinery are attractive targets for 
developing broad-spectrum antivirals. Iminosugars based on deoxynojirimycin have 
been extensively studied as ER α-glucosidase inhibitors; however, other
glycomimetic compounds are less established. Accordingly, we synthesized a series
of N-substituted derivatives of valiolamine, the iminosugar scaffold of type 2
diabetes drug voglibose. To understand the basis for up to 100,000-fold improved 
inhibitory potency, we determined high-resolution crystal structures of mouse ER 
α-GluII in complex with valiolamine and 10 derivatives. The structures revealed
extensive interactions with all four α-GluII subsites. We further showed that
N-substituted valiolamines were active against dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 in
vitro. This study introduces valiolamine-based inhibitors of the ERQC machinery
as candidates for developing potential broad-spectrum therapeutics against the
existing and emerging viruses.
