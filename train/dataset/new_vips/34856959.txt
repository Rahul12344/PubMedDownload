BACKGROUND: Previous research found increased COVID-19 spread associated with
politics and on-demand testing but not in the same study. The objective of this
study is to estimate the contribution of each corrected for the other and a
variety of known risk factors.
METHODS: Using data from 217 U.S. counties of more than 50,000 population where
testing data were available in April, 2021, the associations of COVID-19 deaths
with politics, testing and other risk factors were examined by Poisson and least 
squares regression.
RESULTS: Statistical controls for 15 risk factors failed to eliminate the
association of COVID mortality risk with percent of vote for Donald Trump in 2016
or negative tests per population. Each is independently predictive of increased
mortality.
CONCLUSION: Apparently, many people who test negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus
engage in activities that increase their risk, a problem likely to increase with 
the availability of home tests. There is no association of negative tests with
the Trump vote but, according to polling data, Trump voters' past resistance to
public health recommendations has been extended to resistance to being
vaccinated, threatening the goal of herd immunity.
