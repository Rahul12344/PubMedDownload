OBJECTIVE: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continuing to spread all 
over the world, although there is no specific treatment until now,
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been reported to be effective in recent 
studies. Although long-term use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been
reported to cause QT prolongation and malign arrhythmia, there is not enough data
about the effect of short-term use on arrhythmia. Therefore, this study aims to
assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine +
azithromycin on corrected QT (QTc).
METHODS: A baseline electrocardiogram and on-treatment baseline electrocardiogram
were retrospectively collected in COVID-19 patients who received
hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. The QTc interval was calculated, and the 
baseline and peak QTc intervals were compared. In addition, the peak QTc
intervals of monotherapy and combination therapy were compared.
RESULTS: Of the 155 patients included, 102 (65.8%) patients were using
hydroxychloroquine, and 53 (34.2%) patients were using hydroxychloroquine +
azithromycin combination. The use of both hydroxychloroquine alone and
hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin combined therapy significantly prolonged the
QTc, and the QTc interval was significantly longer in patients receiving
combination therapy. QTc prolongation caused early termination in both groups, 5 
(4.9%) patients in the monotherapy group and 6 (11.3%) patients in the
combination therapy group.
CONCLUSION: In this study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the
treatment of COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent
treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc.
