BACKGROUND: Infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 induces antibodies
that can be used as a proxy for COVID-19. We present a repeated nationwide
cross-sectional study assessing the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the infection
fatality rate (IFR), and infection hospitalization rate (IHR) during the first
year of the pandemic in Norway.
METHODS: Residual serum samples were solicited in April/May 2020 (Round 1), in
July/August 2020 (Round 2) and in January 2021 (Round 3). Antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 were measured using a flow cytometer-based assay. Aggregate data on
confirmed cases, COVID-19-associated deaths and hospitalizations were obtained
from the Emergency preparedness registry for COVID-19 (Beredt C19), and the
seroprevalence estimates were used to estimate IFR and IHR.
RESULTS: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured in 4840 samples. The
estimated seroprevalence increased from 0.8% (95% credible interval [CrI]
0.4%-1.3%) after the first wave of the pandemic (Rounds 1 and 2 combined) to 3.2%
(95% CrI 2.3%-4.2%) (Round 3). The IFR and IHR were higher in the first wave than
in the second wave and increased with age. The IFR was 0.2% (95% CrI 0.1%-0.3%), 
and IHR was 0.9% (95% CrI 0.6%-1.5%) for the second wave.
CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence estimates show a cumulative increase of
SARS-CoV-2 infections over time in the Norwegian population and suggest some
under-recording of confirmed cases. The IFR and IHR were low, corresponding to
the relatively low number of COVID-19-associated deaths and hospitalizations in
Norway. Most of the Norwegian population was still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection after the first year of the pandemic.
