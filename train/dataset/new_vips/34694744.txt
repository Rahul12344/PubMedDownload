Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 are viruses that infect individuals worldwide 
and for which there is no cure or vaccine available. The protective response
against herpes is mostly mediated by CD8 T lymphocytes that respond to the
immunodominant SSIEFARL epitope. However, there are some obstacles concerning the
use of free SSIEFARL for vaccine or immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the feasibility of nanoencapsulation of SSIEFARL and its
immunostimulatory properties. Nano/SSIEFARL was produced by interfacial
polymerization in methylmetacrylate, and the physico-chemical properties,
morphology and immunobiological parameters were evaluated. To evaluate the ex
vivo capacity of Nano/SSIEFARL, we used splenocytes from HSV-1-infected mice to
enhance the frequency of SSIEFARL-specific CD8 T lymphocytes. The results
indicate that Nano/SSIEFARL has a spherical shape, an average diameter of
352 ± 22 nm, the PDI was 0.361 ± 0.009 and is negatively charged (-26.30 ± 35).
The stability at 4°C was 28 days. Also, Nano/SSIEFARL is not toxic for cells at
low concentrations in vitro and it is taken up by JAWS II dendritic cells. No
histopathological changes were observed in kidneys, liver and lymph nodes of
animals treated with Nano/SSIEFARL. Nan/SSIEFARL increased the production of
IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12 by the dendritic cells. Finally, Nano/SSIEFARL expanded
the frequency of SSIEFARL-specific CD8+T lymphocytes at the same rate as free
SSIEFARL. In conclusion all data together indicate that SSIEFARL is suitable for 
nanoencapsulation, and the system produced presents some immunoadjuvant
properties that can be used to improve the immune response against herpes.
