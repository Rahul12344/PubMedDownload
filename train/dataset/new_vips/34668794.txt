The coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic affected the countries differently. South
Africa is a middle-income country with a struggling economy and a
resource-constrained public healthcare system. Three aspects of the pandemic in
South Africa are examined, the lockdown and its effect on personal freedoms, how 
health care resources were used and the novel stratification of health workers
into vulnerability categories. It is a perspective written after experiencing the
first pandemic peak in 2020.
