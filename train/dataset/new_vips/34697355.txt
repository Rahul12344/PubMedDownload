The discovery of new viruses is important for predicting their potential threats 
to the health of humans and other animals. A novel picornavirus was identified
from oral, throat, and anal swab samples collected from belugas (Delphinapterus
leucas), from Dalian Sun Asia Tourism Holding Co., China, between January and
December 2018, using a metagenomics approach. The genome of this novel
PicoV-HMU-1 strain was 8197 nucleotides (nt) in length, with a open reading frame
(from 1091 to 8074 nt) that encoded a polyprotein precursor of 2328 amino acids. 
Moreover, the genomic length and GC content of PicoV-HMU-1 were within the ranges
found in other picornaviruses, and the genome organization was also similar.
Nevertheless, PicoV-HMU-1 had a lower amino acid identity and distinct host
species compared with other members of the Picornaviridae family. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed based on the P1 and 3D amino acid sequences of PicoV-HMU-1
along with representative members of the Picornaviridae family, which showed that
PicoV-HMU-1 was related to unclassified bat picornaviruses groups. These findings
suggest that the PicoV-HMU-1 strain represents a potentially novel genus of
picornavirus. These data can enhance our understanding of the picornavirus
genetic diversity and evolution.
