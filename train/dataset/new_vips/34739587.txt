Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the deadliest diseases of cats in
China. In this study, 120 ascitic fluid samples from FIP-suspected cats were
collected from veterinary hospitals in 21 provinces in China between 2019 and
2021. One hundred nine samples were positive for feline coronavirus (FCoV), with 
no feline immunodeficiency virus infections and one feline leukemia virus
infection (1/109, 0.92%). The prevalence of FCoV was significantly associated
with age (p < 0.01) and was not highly associated with gender, breed,
geographical location, or viral coinfection (p > 0.01). One unique strain,
SD/202012/003, contained a six-nucleotide deletion in the spike gene. Sequence
analysis showed that 94.68% (89/94) of the isolates had a mutation of methionine 
to leucine at position 1058 in the spike protein. The epidemiological data
obtained of FCoV in this study may be beneficial for clinical monitoring of FCoV 
in China.
