Background. Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) in children can be secondary to
central nervous system infections. Several reports have associated ATM with
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Case presentation. We report a previously
healthy 10-year-old boy with paraparesis that started 7 days before admission.
Spinal T2W MRI revealed extensive hyperintense lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid WBC
was 268/µL and PCR examination was positive for EBV. High dose methylprednisolone
(1 g/kg) was given for 5 days, the child was symptom free 3 months after
presentation. Conclusion. Epstein-Barr infection should be considered in ATM,
particularly when CSF WBC count is high.
