The German Central Health Study Hub COVID-19 is an online service that offers
bundled access to COVID-19 related studies conducted in Germany. It combines
metadata and other information of epidemiologic, public health and clinical
studies into a single data repository for FAIR data access. In addition to study 
characteristics the system also allows easy access to study documents, as well as
instruments for data collection. Study metadata and survey instruments are
decomposed into individual data items and semantically enriched to ease the
findability. Data from existing clinical trial registries (DRKS,
clinicaltrails.gov and WHO ICTRP) are merged with epidemiological and public
health studies manually collected and entered. More than 850 studies are listed
as of September 2021.
