Spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) causes severe morbidity and mortality in
grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) in Europe, America and several Asian
countries. We found that FKBP5 (FK506-binding protein 5) is an SVCV infection
response factor; however, its role in the innate immune mechanism caused by SVCV 
infection remains unknown. This study cloned gcFKBP5 (grass carp FKBP5) and made 
its mimic protein structure for function discussion. We found that gcFKBP5
expression in the primary innate immune organs of grass carp, including
intestine, liver and spleen, was highly upregulated by SVCV in 24 h, with a
similar result in fish cells by poly(I:C) treatment. gcFKBP overexpression
aggravates viral damage to cells and increases viral replication. Furthermore,
SVCV engages gcFKBP5 interacting with TRAF2 (tumour necrosis factor
receptor-associated factor 2) to promote host cell apoptosis for supporting viral
replication. The enhanced viral replication seems not to be due to the repression
of IFN and other antiviral factors as expected. For the first time, these data
show the pivotal role of gcFKBP5 in the innate immune response of grass carp to
SVCV infection.
