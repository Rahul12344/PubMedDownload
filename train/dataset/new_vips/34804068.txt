Background: Data regarding symptoms in the lactating mother-infant dyad and their
immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during lactation are needed to
inform vaccination guidelines.
Methods: From a prospective cohort of 50 lactating individuals who received
mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2), blood and milk samples
were collected prior to first vaccination dose, immediately prior to 2nd dose,
and 4-10 weeks after 2nd dose. Symptoms in mother and infant were assessed by
detailed questionnaires. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in blood and milk were
measured by Pylon 3D automated immunoassay and ELISA. In addition,
vaccine-related PEGylated proteins in milk were measured by ELISA. Blood samples 
were collected from a subset of infants whose mothers received the vaccine during
lactation (4-15 weeks after mothers' 2nd dose).
Results: No severe maternal or infant adverse events were reported in this
cohort. Two mothers and two infants were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study
period before achieving full immune response. PEGylated proteins were not found
at significant levels in milk after vaccination. After vaccination, levels of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM significantly increased in maternal plasma and there 
was significant transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2-Receptor Binding Domain (anti-RBD)
IgA and IgG antibodies to milk. Milk IgA levels after the 2nd dose were
negatively associated with infant age. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were not
detected in the plasma of infants whose mothers were vaccinated during lactation.
Conclusions: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generate robust immune responses in plasma
and milk of lactating individuals without severe adverse events reported.
