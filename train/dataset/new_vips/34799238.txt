INTRODUCTION: The assessment of the risk of virus transmission through papers,
such as postcards, is important. However, the stability of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus (IAV) on
different types of papers is currently unknown. Investigation of the survival
time of these viruses on different types of papers will provide insights into
their risk of long-distance transport by postal items.
METHODS: We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, mixed with a culture
medium, on the surface of postcards with various coatings, including plain paper 
(PP), inkjet paper (IP), and inkjet photo paper (IPP). The surface structure of
each paper was microscopically assessed.
RESULTS: The surface structures of PP, IP, and IPP varied greatly depending on
the presence or absence, and type, of coat layer, regardless of the base
material. IP and IPP surfaces were less conducive to virus survival than PP
surfaces, because of the difference in surface shapes. The survival times of
SARS-CoV-2 on each paper were approximately 59.8 (PP), 6.5 (IP), and 9.8 h (IPP),
and significantly longer than those of IAV (10.3, 1.8, and 3.3 h, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via paper, such as postcards, is
significantly higher than that of IAV transmission. While PP, IP, and IPP have
the same base material, their surface structures differ, which affects viral
stability. The IP and IPP surfaces are less suitable for virus survival. This
study provides novel insights into the risks of viral transmission via paper.
