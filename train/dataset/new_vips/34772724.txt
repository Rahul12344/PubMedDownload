OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic on FP finances in Alberta.
DESIGN: A financial model that included fees, visits per day, number of days of
practice, and overhead costs.
SETTING: Alberta before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical fee-for-service FP practices.
INTERVENTIONS: Changes in practice modes caused by the pandemic and changes to
fees set by the Government of Alberta (no interventions were controlled by the
researchers).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual average FP billings and annual average FP income
after overhead expenses.
RESULTS: Practice changes related to COVID-19 could result in a reduction in
average FP income (billings after expenses) of 27% to 78%.
CONCLUSION: Practice pattern changes, including the rapid adoption of
telemedicine owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, will reduce incomes for
fee-for-service community FP practices in Alberta. Fees at current levels could
make some practices unsustainable.
