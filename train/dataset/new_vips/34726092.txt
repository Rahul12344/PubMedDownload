The clinical presentations of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are varied
and range from asymptomatic to a prodrome of tingling and burning followed by
painful vesicles, erosions and ulcers. Resolution leads to latent infection of
the sensory ganglia. HSV-1 is associated with most of the nongenital HSV-induced 
infections and HSV-2 is generally associated with anogenital lesions; however,
lesions at either site may be caused by both viruses. In persons living with HIV 
(PLHIV), the lesions have been described as verrucous/hypertrophic, exophytic or 
vegetative and may suggest a neoplastic rather than an infective process and this
can be a diagnostic dilemma in resource-limited countries with no access to
confirmatory diagnostic testing for HSV. We report on two PLHIV who developed
rapidly growing lesions on the face that clinically mimicked neoplasia but were
found to be HSV-associated squamous proliferative lesions which responded to high
dose acyclovir.
