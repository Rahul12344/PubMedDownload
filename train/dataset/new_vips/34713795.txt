BackgroundIn the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, viral genomes are available at
unprecedented speed, but spatio-temporal bias in genome sequence sampling
precludes phylogeographical inference without additional contextual data.AimWe
applied genomic epidemiology to trace SARS-CoV-2 spread on an international,
national and local level, to illustrate how transmission chains can be resolved
to the level of a single event and single person using integrated sequence data
and spatio-temporal metadata.MethodsWe investigated 289 COVID-19 cases at a
university hospital in Munich, Germany, between 29 February and 27 May 2020.
Using the ARTIC protocol, we obtained near full-length viral genomes from 174
SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory samples. Phylogenetic analyses using the Auspice 
software were employed in combination with anamnestic reporting of travel
history, interpersonal interactions and perceived high-risk exposures among
patients and healthcare workers to characterise cluster outbreaks and establish
likely scenarios and timelines of transmission.ResultsWe identified multiple
independent introductions in the Munich Metropolitan Region during the first
weeks of the first pandemic wave, mainly by travellers returning from popular
skiing areas in the Alps. In these early weeks, the rate of presumable
hospital-acquired infections among patients and in particular healthcare workers 
was high (9.6% and 54%, respectively) and we illustrated how transmission chains 
can be dissected at high resolution combining virus sequences and spatio-temporal
networks of human interactions.ConclusionsEarly spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe
was catalysed by superspreading events and regional hotspots during the winter
holiday season. Genomic epidemiology can be employed to trace viral spread and
inform effective containment strategies.
