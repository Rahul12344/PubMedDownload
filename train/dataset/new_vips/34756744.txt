Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can result in many ocular manifestations. We
report a rare case of bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy post-infection
with COVID-19 in a 38-year-old woman who presented with bilateral blurred vision 
1 month after infection with COVID-19. She reported fever, cough, and shortness
of breath and was COVID-PCR positive. During her 10-day hospital stay, she
received oxygen, antibiotics, heparin and corticosteroids intravenously and then 
orally. After her recovery from COVID-19, the patient developed progressive
visual loss in both eyes: her corrected visual acuity was 3/10 in both eyes, the 
anterior segment was normal, and the vitreous was clear. Fundus examination,
optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography showed bilateral serous 
retinal detachments. Her course was characterized by improvement in visual acuity
and regression of the retinal detachments. Central serous chorioretinopathy can
occur after COVID-19 infection due to the administration of corticosteroids;
thus, ophthalmologic examination is essential to detect ocular involvement as
early as possible.
