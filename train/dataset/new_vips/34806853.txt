behavioral health care and intentions to leave the U.S. Army.

The attrition of service members is a costly concern for the U.S. military and
can lead to reduced readiness. While there have been studies identifying reasons 
for attrition, little is known about the relationship between perceived barriers 
to behavioral health care and attrition. A cross-sectional survey was conducted
as part of a behavioral health epidemiological consultation at a U.S. Army
division (n=5,842) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Odds of intending to
leave the Army increased by 6% for each additional perceived barrier to
behavioral health care. Soldiers' concerns about the potential negative impacts
on their careers or work environments were the most frequently cited barriers to 
behavioral health care.
