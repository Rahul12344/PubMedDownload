As a fierce pathogen, spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) can cause high
mortality in the common carp, and its glycoprotein (G protein) is a component of 
the viral structure on the surface of virion, which is crucial in viral life
cycle. This report adopted tandem affinity purification (TAP), mass spectrometry 
analysis (LC-MS/MS), immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy assays to
identify Heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) as an interaction partner of SVCV 
G protein. It was found that HSC70 overexpression dramatically inhibited SVCV
replication, whereas its loss of functions elicited opposing effects on SVCV
replication. Mechanistic studies indicate that HSC70 induces lysosomal
degradation of ubiquitinated-SVCV G protein. This study further demonstrates that
Membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is critical for
SVCV G protein ubiquitylation and leads to its lysosomal degradation.
Furthermore, the MARCH8 mediated ubiquitylation of SVCV G protein required the
participation of HSC70 through forming a multicomponent complex. Taken together, 
these results demonstrate that HSC70 serves as a scaffold for MARCH8 and SVCV G, 
which leads to the ubiquitylation and degradation of SVCV G protein and thus
inhibits viral replication. These findings have established a novel host defense 
mechanism against SVCV.
