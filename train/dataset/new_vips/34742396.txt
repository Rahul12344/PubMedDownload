Described here is the use of piggyBac transposase generated HEK293 stable cell
pools for doxycycline-inducible protein production. The key benefits of the
system are that low amounts of plasmid DNA are needed for transfection, high
levels of protein expression can be achieved also for toxic proteins at robust
scalability and reproducibility and the recombinant cell line can be stored as
frozen cell bank. Transfection, selection, expression and purification of
enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are
described in this chapter.
