OBJECTIVES: Evidence of the relationship between climate variability, air
pollution and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infections has been inconsistent. 
We assessed this in a paediatric population from a highly urbanized tropical
city-state.
METHODS: We analysed all reports of HPIV infections in children <5 years old
obtained from a major specialist women and children's hospital in Singapore.
Assuming a negative binomial distribution and using multivariable fractional
polynomial modelling, we examined the relations between climate variability, air 
quality and the risk of HPIV infections, adjusting for time-varying confounders.
RESULTS: We identified 6393 laboratory-confirmed HPIV infections from 2009 to
2019. Every 1 °C decline in temperature was associated with a 5.8% increase (RR: 
0.943, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 0.903-0.984) in HPIV infection risk 6
days later. Every 10% decrease in relative humidity was associated with a 15.8%
cumulative increase in HPIV risk over the next 6 days (cumulative RR: 0.842, 95% 
CI: 0.771-0.919). Rainfall was positively associated with HPIV risk 2 days later 
(RR: 1.021, 95% CI: 1.000-1.043). A within-year seasonal rise of HPIV was driven 
by HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 and preceded by a seasonal decline in temperature. Gender
was an effect modifier of the climate-HPIV relationship. Air quality was not
associated with HPIV risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a close association between HPIV infection
risk and tropical climate variability. The climate dependence and seasonal
predictability of HPIV can inform the timing of community campaigns aimed at
reducing infection risk and the development of hospital resources and climate
adaption plans.
