Objective: Influenza co-infection with fungal infection increases the risk of
death. Our study was to estimate risk factors associated with invasive pulmonary 
mycosis (IPM) among severe influenza patients at a single center in Beijing,
China.
Methods: A retrospective chart review was carried out of all patients with severe
influenza admitted to respiratory the department including the respiratory
intensive care unit (RICU) during the 2014 to 2019 influenza seasons in Beijing
Chao-yang hospital, China. We compared the differences of characteristics and
examination outcomes between IPM patients and non-IPM patients, and explored the 
predictors of IPM by a multivariate logistic regression.
Results: Influenza associated IPM was found in 65 of 131 (49.62%) patients. The
average age of IPM patients was 57.28±14.56 years and 70.77% were male. The
mortality rate was much higher in the IPM group than the non-IPM group (34.85%
versus 18.46%, P=0.026). Older age, hypoimmunity, liver disease, hypertension,
positive serum GM test, steroids using, gasping, gastrointestinal symptoms, high 
APECHEII, low oxygenation index, other viruses co-infection, bacterial
co-infection, low lymphocyte counts, low CD4+ T-cell counts, low CD8+ T-cell
counts, low RBC, low hemoglobin, low platelets, high N%, low total protein, high 
CRP, low albumin, low fibrinogen, high BUN, positive serum GM test, more
mechanical ventilation requirement, and more renal replacement requirement were
risk factors of influenza IPM co-infection.
Conclusion: IPM is a severe complication of influenza hospitalizations. It is
associated with increasing mortality, longer hospital stays, and higher hospital 
charges compared with non-IPM patients. Clinicians caring for patients with
severe influenza should consider IPM.
