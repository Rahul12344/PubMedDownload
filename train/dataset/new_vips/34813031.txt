We report a case of hepatic lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma-hepatocellular
carcinoma subtype (LEL-HCC) in a 41-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection. The patient presented with abdominal pain and further assessment
revealed a hypoechoic mass on ultrasonography. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 
13·6 ng/dl. The patient was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma based on the
established triphasic computed tomography (TCT) diagnostic criteria and he
underwent a surgical resection of the mass. Microscopic examination showed sheets
and cords of malignant epithelial cells intermixed with heavy lymphoid
infiltrate, with more than 100 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) per 10
high-power-field (HPF). Based on immunohistochemical studies, the malignant cells
were positive for Hep Par 1 and glypican 3, focally positive for cytokeratin 7
(CK7), and negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK20). TILs were diffusely positive for
cluster of differentiation 3 CD3 with an approximately equal CD4/CD8 ratio. The
patient was recurrence free at 25 months after surgery, as evident by CT and
serum alpha-fetoprotein level. LEL-HCC is a rare variant of HCC with a relatively
better prognosis. Exploring the potential for immune modulator-based therapy in
this subset of tumors is highly recommended.
