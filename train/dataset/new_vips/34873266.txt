miRNAs have been extensively studied in pathological conditions, including viral 
infections, such as those provoked by HIV-1. Several cellular and circulating
miRNAs are altered during HIV-1 infection, with either beneficial effects on host
defenses or enhanced virus infectivity. Blood samples were collected in sterile
EDTA tubes and plasma was separated and stored, as were PBMCs. RNA was isolated
and reverse-transcribed. Finally, the miRNA gene expression profile was assessed 
using TaqMan Array Human microRNA Card A v2.0. A comprehensive statistical
analysis was performed on the results obtained. This is the first study on miRNAs
in HIV-1 paediatric patients, and a miRNA profile differentiating patients
starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) at different times after HIV-1
diagnosis was established. Thirty-four miRNAs were observed to have different
expression levels between the control group and the cART group. The data
indicates the need to start cART as soon as possible after the establishment of
HIV-1 infection to assure the best outcome possible. Finally, the selected 34
miRNAs may be used as biomarkers for prognosis and assessing therapy
effectiveness. However, more research must be conducted to establish adequate
quantitative correlations.
