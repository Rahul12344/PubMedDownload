BACKGROUND: Australia is theoretically at risk of epidemic chikungunya virus
(CHIKV) activity as the principal vectors are present on the mainland Aedes
aegypti) and some islands of the Torres Strait (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus). 
Both vectors are highly invasive and adapted to urban environments with a
capacity to expand their distributions into south-east Queensland and other
states in Australia. We sought to estimate the epidemic potential of CHIKV, which
is not currently endemic in Australia, by considering exclusively transmission by
the established vector in Australia, Ae. aegypti, due to the historical relevance
and anthropophilic nature of the vector.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We estimated the historical (1995-2019) epidemic 
potential of CHIKV in eleven Australian locations, including the Torres Strait,
using a basic reproduction number equation. We found that the main urban centres 
of Northern Australia could sustain an epidemic of CHIKV. We then estimated
future trends in epidemic potential for the main centres for the years 2020 to
2029. We also conducted uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on the variables
comprising the basic reproduction number and found high sensitivity to mosquito
population size, human population size, impact of vector control and human
infectious period.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: By estimating the epidemic potential for CHIKV
transmission on mainland Australia and the Torres Strait, we identified key areas
of focus for controlling vector populations and reducing human exposure. As the
epidemic potential of the virus is estimated to rise towards 2029, a greater
focus on control and prevention measures should be implemented in at-risk
locations.
