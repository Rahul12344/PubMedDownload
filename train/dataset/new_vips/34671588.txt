Detection and prediction of the novel Coronavirus present new challenges for the 
medical research community due to its widespread across the globe. Methods driven
by Artificial Intelligence can help predict specific parameters, hazards, and
outcomes of such a pandemic. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have proven
a novel opportunity to determine various difficulties in prediction. In this
work, two learning algorithms, namely deep learning and reinforcement learning,
were developed to forecast COVID-19. This article constructs a model using
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly the Modified Long Short-Term Memory
(MLSTM) model, to forecast the count of newly affected individuals, losses, and
cures in the following few days. This study also suggests deep learning
reinforcement to optimize COVID-19's predictive outcome based on symptoms.
Real-world data was utilized to analyze the success of the suggested system. The 
findings show that the established approach promises prognosticating outcomes
concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic and outperformed the Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model and the Machine Learning model, Logistic Regresion (LR) in
terms of error rate.
