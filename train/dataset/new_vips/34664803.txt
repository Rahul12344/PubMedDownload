A nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 occurred
in two general wards. One outbreak had pre-symptomatic transmission and was
linked epidemiologically with an index case. The other outbreak was associated
with early detection failure in a crowded room. Notably, adherence to appropriate
mask wearing was not confirmed in the hospital outbreak. Confirmed cases were
moved into isolation rooms, and contacts were quarantined. Quarantined cases were
tested regularly and facilitated early termination of the hospital outbreak.
