OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of siRNA hsa-circ-0000885 modified bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on osteogenic differentiation, cell proliferation 
and apoptosis in order to provide new ideas and methods for the clinical
treatment of osteoporosis (OP).
METHODS: From September 2018 to February 2020, 13 patients with osteoporosis
admitted to our hospital were selected as the research objects, including 11
females and 2 males, with an age of (65.45Â±10.77) years old. After obtaining the 
informed consent of patients, peripheral blood tissues were extracted. Then the
expression level of cir-cRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) was
detected by circ RNA chip. The expression of circ RNA was silenced by siRNA
technology. The BMSCs were transfected with lentivirus. According to the siRNA
interference plasmid hsa-circ-0000885, the cells were divided into the blank
group, the empty vector group and the siRNA interference group. After 72 hours of
treatment, the cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry, the apoptosis level was
detected by AV-PI kit, and the osteogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs was
detected by ALP staining.
RESULTS: The expression of hsa-circ-0000885 in PBMC of patients with osteoporosis
was significantly higher than that of healthy controls (t=2.119, P<0.05). ALP
staining showed that siR-NA hsa-circ-0000885 could promote the osteogenic
differentiation of BMSCs, which was obviously too much in the blank group and
blank plasmid group (F=9.132, q=2.995, 2.897;P=0.009, 0.012<0.05). The results of
CCK-8 showed that siRNA hsa-circ-0000885 could promote the proliferation of
BMSCs, which was significantly higher than that of the blank group and blank
plasmid group (F=9.881, q=2.457, 2.904;P=0.032, 0.016<0.05). The results of AV-PI
showed that the apoptosis rate of siRNA interference group was significantly
lower than that of blank group and blank plasmid group(F=10.208;q=2.885, 3.001;
P=0.019, 0.011<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The lentivirus mediated siRNA hsa-circ-0000885 plasmid transfected
into BMSCs and osteoclast co culture system can promote cell proliferation,
inhibit apoptosis and promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, which can be
used as a potential therapeutic target for OP patients.
