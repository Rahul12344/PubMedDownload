The longitudinal quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 survivors, especially those
with post-acute sequelae (PASC) is not well described. We evaluated QoL in our
COVID-19 survivor cohort over 6 months using the RAND SF-36 survey. From July
2020-March 2021 we enrolled 110 adults from the United States with a positive
SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) into the Northern
Colorado Coronavirus Biobank (NoCo-COBIO). Demographic data and symptom
surveillance were collected from 62 adults. In total, 42% were hospitalized, and 
58% were non-hospitalized. The Rand SF-36 consists of 36 questions and 8 scales, 
and questions are scored 0-100. A lower-scale score indicates a lower QoL. In
conclusion, hospitalization, PASC, and disease severity were associated with
significantly lower scores on the RAND SF-36 in Physical Functioning, Role
Limitation due to Physical Health, Energy/Fatigue, Social Functioning, and
General Health. Long-term monitoring of COVID-19 survivors is needed to fully
understand the impact of the disease on QoL and could have implications for
interventions to alleviate suffering during recovery.
