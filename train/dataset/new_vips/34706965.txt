OBJECTIVES: To report findings on brain MRI and neurocognitive function, as well 
as persisting fatigue at long-term follow-up after COVID-19 hospitalisation in
patients identified as high risk for affection of the central nervous system.
DESIGN: Ambidirectional observational cohort study.
SETTING: All 734 patients from a regional population in Sweden with a
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis admitted to hospital during the period 1 
March to 31 May 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: A subgroup (n=185) with persisting symptoms still interfering with 
daily life at a telephone follow-up 4 months after discharge were invited for a
medical and neuropsychological evaluation. Thirty-five of those who were assessed
with a neurocognitive test battery at the clinical visit, and presented a
clinical picture concerning for COVID-19-related brain pathology, were further
investigated by brain MRI.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Findings on brain MRI, neurocognitive test results and
reported fatigue.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (71%) had abnormalities on MRI; multiple white
matter lesions were the most common finding. Sixteen patients (46%) demonstrated 
impaired neurocognitive function, of which 10 (29%) had severe impairment.
Twenty-six patients (74%) reported clinically significant fatigue. Patients with 
abnormalities on MRI had a lower Visuospatial Index (p=0.031) compared with the
group with normal MRI findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients selected to undergo MRI after a clinical
evaluation, a majority of patients had abnormal MRI and/or neurocognitive test
results. Abnormal findings were not restricted to patients with severe disease.
