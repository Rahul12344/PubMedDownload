BACKGROUND: the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid antibody test were
investigated for the screening of healthcare workers.
METHODS: the serum of 389 health care workers exposed to COVID-19 patients or
with symptoms, were analysed. All workers underwent monthly the screening for
SARS-CoV-2 with detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR. IgG
antibody detection in serum was performed by Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA)
and by the Rapid test (KHB diagnostic kit for SARS CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody after a
median of 7.6 weeks (25°-75° percentiles 6.6-11.5).
RESULTS: the rapid test resulted positive in 31/132 (23.5%), 16/135 (11.8%) and
0/122 cases in COVID-19 positive individuals, in those with only SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies and in those negative for both tests, respectively. Sensitivity was
17.6% (CI95% 13.2-22.7) and 23.5% (CI95% 16.5-31.6), and specificity was 100%
(CI95% 97-100) and 100% (CI95% 97-100) considering Rapid test vs CLIA IgG or
Rapid test vs SARS-CoV-2 positive RNA detection, respectively.
CONCLUSION: the KHB Rapid test is not suitable for the screening of workers with 
previous COVID-19 infection.
