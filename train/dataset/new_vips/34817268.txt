SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe and infected hundreds of millions 
of people worldwide. As our experience with this virus continues to grow, our
understanding of the both short and long-term complications of infection with
SARS-CoV-2 continues to grow as well. Just as there is heterogeneity in the acute
infectious phase, there is heterogeneity in the long-term complications seen
following COVID-19 illness. The purpose of this review article is to present the 
current literature with regards to the epidemiology, pathophysiology and proposed
management algorithms for the various long term sequalae that have been observed 
in each organ system following infection with SARS-CoV-2. We will also consider
future directions, with regards to newer variants of the virus and their
potential impact on the long-term complications observed.
