BACKGROUND: African American (AA) women experience disproportionate levels of
chronic disease, which is theorized to be driven by greater exposure to acute and
chronic stress. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has further exacerbated
existing health disparities among AA communities. Understanding how AA women have
experienced and responded to stress during the pandemic may help to inform how
future interventions can better address physical and mental well-being in AA
communities.
AIMS: Drawing from stress and coping models and an ecological framework, the
present study conducted a theory-based qualitative assessment of stress-related
experiences during the pandemic among a cohort of AA women, including (1) sources
of stress, (2) coping strategies, (3) perceptions of health-related behaviors,
(4) the role of community, and (5) recommendations for future interventions.
METHOD: After completing a group-based physical activity intervention program
during the COVID-19 pandemic, a cohort of AA women (N =17, Mage= 49.3 Â± 11.24)
completed individual interviews. Sessions were conducted by phone, audiotaped,
transcribed, and coded by independent raters (rs = .71-.73). Themes were
identified using deductive and inductive approaches.
RESULTS: Among sources of stress directly related to the pandemic, being at home,
getting sick, and homeschooling/parenting were the most frequently discussed
themes. Participants engaged in active coping (problem and emotion-focused), with
health behaviors, social support, and religion/spirituality, emerging as
frequently discussed themes. Although some participants reported passive coping
strategies (e.g., avoidance), this approach was less pronounced.
CONCLUSIONS: These qualitative results are used to guide suggestions for future
interventions that jointly address stress and health-related behaviors in order
to improve translation of research into practice and policy for future pandemics 
and disasters.
