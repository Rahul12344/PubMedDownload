By re-analzying public metagenomic data from 101 patients infected with influenza
A virus during the 2007-2012 H1N1 flu seasons in France, we identified 22 samples
with SARS-CoV sequences. In 3 of them, the SARS genome sequences could be fully
assembled out of each. These sequences are highly similar (99.99% and 99.7%) to
the artificially constructed recombinant SARS-CoV (SARSr-CoV) strains generated
by the J. Craig Venter Institute in the USA. Moreover, samples from different flu
seasons have different SARS-CoV strains, and the divergence between these strains
cannot be explained by natural evolution. Our study also shows that retrospective
studies using public metagenomic data from past major epidemic outbreaks serve as
a genomic strategy for researching the origins or spread of infectious diseases.
