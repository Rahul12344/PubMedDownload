The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 235
million cases worldwide and 4.8 million deaths (October 2021), with varying
incidences and mortalities among regions/ethnicities. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV,
SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 utilize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as
the receptor to enter cells. We hypothesized that the genetic variability in ACE2
may contribute to the variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19. To test this
hypothesis, we first conducted an in silico investigation of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of ACE2. We then applied an integrated 
approach of genetics, biochemistry and virology to explore the capacity of select
ACE2 variants to bind coronavirus spike proteins and mediate viral entry. We
identified the ACE2 D355N variant that restricts the spike protein-ACE2
interaction and consequently limits infection both in vitro and in vivo. In
conclusion, ACE2 polymorphisms could modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, which
may lead to variable disease severity. IMPORTANCE There is considerable variation
in disease severity among patients infected with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Human genetic variation can affect disease outcome, and the
coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 utilize human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter cells. We found
that several missense ACE2 SNVs that showed significantly altered binding with
the spike proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and NL63-HCoV. We identified an ACE2
SNP D355N that restricts the spike protein-ACE2 interaction and consequently have
the potential to protect individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study
highlights ACE2 polymorphisms could impact human susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2,
which may contribute to ethnic and geographical differences in SARS-CoV-2 spread 
and pathogenicity.
