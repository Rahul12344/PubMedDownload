People who receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, particularly perimenopausal women
who are on birth control or postmenopausal women who take estrogen supplements,
may experience thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Estrogen and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
vaccine both have the potential to cause thrombus in different ways. Some
postmenopausal women who are also taking estrogens may develop thrombosis and
thrombocytopenia after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Therefore, women
are encouraged to stop taking drugs containing estrogen before receiving this
vaccine. Furthermore, consuming fish oil can help reduce the risk of developing
blood clots among women who are in the luteal phase and, thus, have high estrogen
levels. In addition, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19's side effects in young women could be
mitigated by administering it during the follicular phase.
