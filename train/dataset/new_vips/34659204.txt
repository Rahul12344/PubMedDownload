Emerging evidence has unveiled the secondary infection as one of the mortal
causes of post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the factors related to secondary
bacterial or fungi infection remains largely unexplored. We here systematically
investigated the factors that might contribute to secondary infection. By
clinical examination index analysis of patients, combined with the integrative
analysis with RNA-seq analysis in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolated 
shortly from initial infection, this study showed that the antibiotic catabolic
process and myeloid cell homeostasis were activated while the T-cell response
were relatively repressed in those with the risk of secondary infection. Further 
monitoring analysis of immune cell and liver injury analysis showed that the risk
of secondary infection was accompanied by severe lymphocytopenia at the
intermediate and late stages and liver injury at the early stages of SARS-CoV-2. 
Moreover, the metagenomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the
microbial culture analysis, to some extent, showed that the severe
pneumonia-related bacteria have already existed in the initial infection.
