Receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion are essential for the
establishment of successful infection by SARS-CoV-2. Halting these steps can cure
COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal
antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at
sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane
fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection
against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no
obvious adverse events when administrated with 10 times the effective dose of
HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal
that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding 
to the ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further
conformational changes of the receptor binding domain, possibly interfering with 
progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results suggest
that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19.
