BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne
viral zoonosis with up to 50% mortality rate in humans. In addition to the role
of animals in the transmission of the virus and spread of infected ticks through 
livestock trade, they can be employed as sentinel hosts for monitoring the
infection. Iran is one of the endemic counties for CCHF and the disease has been 
documented in all provinces. However, in some provinces such as Kohgiluyeh and
Boyer-Ahmad, the rate of the disease has been dramatically low. Therefore, this
serosurvey was designed to investigate CCHF virus (CCHFV) seroprevalence among
livestock in different parts of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province.
METHODS: This study was conducted in 2017, in which, blood samples were collected
from 501 sheep and goats from eight different cities of Kohgiluyeh and
Boyer-Ahmad Province. CCHFV IgG antibodies were detected in livestock serum
samples by specific ELISA assays for detection of ovine and caprine antibodies.
RESULTS: In total, four sheep serum of out of 501 (0.8%) livestock samples (3
from Gachsaran and 1 from Dena) had CCHFV IgG antibodies. No significant
association was found between CCHFV seropositivity and sex or age of animals
(P>0.05).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a minor CCHFV circulation in
Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran. However, due to the notion that
outbreaks of tick-borne infections is hard to predict; steady and comprehensive
monitoring programs especially in ticks and animals would be critical for
understanding the circulation on the pathogen in a region.
