BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are two major
types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with regulatory roles. The initiation and
progression of numerous diseases have been linked to genetic variation in miRNAs 
and lncRNAs. Many diseases, including hepatitis infection, are thought to be
regulated by miRNA-LncRNA interactions. In this study, Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in miR-372 (rs28461391 C/T) and HULC (rs7763881 A/C) were
believed to play a role in HBV infection risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the Polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer
technique (PCR-SSP), 100 HBV patients and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for
SNPs rs28461391 in miR-372 and rs7763881 in HULC. There was no significant
difference in miR-372 rs12983273 genotype distribution between controls and HBV
patients, according to our findings. On the other hand, there was a significant
increase in HULC rs7763881 CC genotype (P < 0.05) coincides with a significant
decrease in AC genotype distribution (P < 0.05) in HBV patients as compared to
controls. Our results showed that the AA genotype is protective for HBV infection
(OR 0.3; CI 0.13-9.07) while the CC genotype is associated with an increased risk
of HBV infection (OR 3.43; CI 1.3-9.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HULC rs7763881 A/C might be a biomarker for
HBV susceptibility. Larger sample studies are needed to confirm our preliminary
data. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to
investigate the relevance of miR-372 (rs28461391 C/T) and HULC (rs7763881 A/C)
gene polymorphisms to the risk of HBV infection in the Egyptian population.
