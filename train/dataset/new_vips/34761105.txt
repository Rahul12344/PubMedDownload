Chandipura virus (CHPV) is an emerging human pathogen of great clinical
significance. In this study, we have investigated the susceptibility pattern of
both normal and cancer cell lines of human origin to wild-type (wt) CHPV in order
to explore the possibility of developing CHPV as an oncolytic vector (OV). Marked
cytopathic effect along with enhanced virus output was observed in cancer cell
lines (HeLa, A549, U-138, PC-3, and HepG2) in comparison to normal human adult
dermal fibroblast (HADF) cells. At an MOI of 0.1, cancer cell lines were
differentially susceptible to CHPV, with cells like HeLa and U-138 having
pronounced cell death, while the PC-3 were comparatively resistant. All cell
lines used in the study except U-138 restricted CHPV infection to varying degrees
with IFN-β pre-treatment and supplementation of interferon (IFN) could neither
activate the IFN signaling pathway in U-138 cells. Finally, U-138 tumor
xenografts established in non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency
(NOD/SCID) mice showed significant delay in tumor growth in the CHPV-challenged
animals. Thus, targeted cytopathic effect in cancer cells at a very low dose with
restricted replication in normal cells offers a rationale to exploit CHPV as an
oncolytic vector in the future.
