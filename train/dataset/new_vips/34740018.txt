We aimed to explore the potential biomarkers and susceptible population for early
diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Ten hub differentially expressed
TB-related genes (DETRGs) from GSE83456 dataset were screened with the "limma"
package and the GeneCards database. Unsupervised clustering was utilized to
identify susceptible population among TB patients based on 10 hub DETRGs.
TRANSFAC, MirTarbase, miRanda and TargetScan was used to predict microRNAs and
transcription factors (TFs) and construct TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. The
results showed that a total of 266 DEGs were identified. Functional analysis
mainly enriched in interferon pathway, cytokine and receptor interaction and host
defense response to virus, while the four-module genes screened were closely
related to interferon-γ signal transduction pathway as well. Based on 10 DETRGs, 
TB patients were divided into two clusters with significant differences in
neutrophil function and 16 hub miRNAs and 10 hub TFs were predicted. Finally,
NFATc1- (miR145) - STAT1 regulatory pathway was identified as the critical
regulatory pathway, which mediates cytokine receptor binding, interleukin-1
receptor binding and TNF signaling pathway. Hence, we concluded that
immunoheterogeneity exists among TB patients and NFATC1-(miR145)-STAT1 regulatory
pathway might be associated with tuberculosis infection, which may be valuable
targets for prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.
