This paper provides a short review of bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) control
programmes across Europe, with a particular focus on current efforts from a
stakeholder perspective. Using outputs gained from a global, virtual congress on 
BVD control, the theory of the journey from BVD control to possible eradication
is enriched with insight from stakeholders representing the major parts of the
cattle industry. Current control programmes were presented by Javier Dieguez
(Galicia), Neil Shand (England), Neil Paton (Wales), Jenny Purcell (Scotland),
Maria Guelbenzu (Ireland), JÃ¶rn Gethmann (Germany), and Matthias Schweizer
(Switzerland).
