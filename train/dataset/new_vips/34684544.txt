The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to food security in many countries,
including Kenya. However, the impact of this on food provision to children at an 
individual level is unknown. This small study aimed to provide a qualitative
snapshot of the diets of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. During completion
of 24-h food recalls, with 15 families with children aged 5-8 years, caregivers
were asked about changes they had made to foods given to their children due to
the pandemic. Food recalls were analysed to assess nutrient intakes. Qualitative 
comments were thematically analysed. Most of the families reported making some
changes to foods they provided to their children due to COVID-19. Reasons for
these changes fell into three themes, inability to access foods (both due to
formal restriction of movements and fear of leaving the house), poorer
availability of foods, and financial constraints (both decreases in income and
increases in food prices). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected some foods parents 
in rural Kenya can provide to their children.
