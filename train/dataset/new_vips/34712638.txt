The world is in the midst of a crisis unlike any other in recent memory. COVID-19
is a pandemic that is urgent, global in scope, and has huge consequences. The
policy sciences provide insights into unfolding trends, and this article uses the
lessons of the literature to better understanding the policymaking shifts and
population acceptability of COVID-19. The author attempts to investigate how
policymakers' emotions and narratives affect policy decisions and form
policymaker-population relationships. The author addresses policymaking
processes, transitions, interpretations of policy responses, policy
implementation through multilateral topics and evaluating policy progress and
failure. Trust is linked to cultural norms, values, and faiths in policy
literature, and it is seen as a component of key social and economic policy
outcomes. The author ends by identifying understudied facets of policymaking that
need to be addressed during pandemics.
