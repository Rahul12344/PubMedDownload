A comprehensive study of the B cell response against SARS-CoV-2 could be
significant for understanding the immune response and developing therapeutical
antibodies and vaccines. To define the dynamics and characteristics of the
antibody repertoire following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the mRNA
transcripts of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) repertoires of 24 peripheral
blood samples collected between 3 and 111 days after symptom onset from 10
COVID-19 patients. Massive clonal expansion of naïve B cells with limited somatic
hypermutation (SHM) was observed in the second week after symptom onset. The
proportion of low-SHM IgG clones strongly correlated with spike-specific IgG
antibody titers, highlighting the significant activation of naïve B cells in
response to a novel virus infection. The antibody isotype switching landscape
showed a transient IgA surge in the first week after symptom onset, followed by a
sustained IgG elevation that lasted for at least 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 infection
elicited poly-germline reactive antibody responses. Interestingly, 17 different
IGHV germline genes recombined with IGHJ6 showed significant clonal expansion. By
comparing the IgH repertoires that we sequenced with the 774 reported
SARS-CoV-2-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 13 shared spike-specific IgH
clusters were found. These shared spike-specific IgH clusters are derived from
the same lineage of several recently published neutralizing mAbs, including
CC12.1, CC12.3, C102, REGN10977, and 4A8. Furthermore, identical spike-specific
IgH sequences were found in different COVID-19 patients, suggesting a highly
convergent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis based on sequencing
antibody repertoires from different individuals revealed key signatures of the
systemic B cell response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Although the
canonical delineation of serum antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection 
has been well established, the dynamics of antibody repertoire at the mRNA
transcriptional level has not been well understood, especially the correlation
between serum antibody titers and the antibody mRNA transcripts. In this study,
we analyzed the IgH transcripts and characterized the B cell clonal expansion and
differentiation, isotype switching, and somatic hypermutation in COVID-19
patients. This study provided insights at the repertoire level for the B cell
response after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
