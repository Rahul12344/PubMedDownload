OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is often accompanied by
gastrointestinal symptoms, which are related to gut microbiota dysbiosis (GMD).
Whether washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) is an effective treatment for
COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD by restoring the gut microbiota is
unknown. This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of WMT in
COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD.
METHODS: This is a randomized, multicenter, single-blind prospective study.
COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD will be randomly divided to receive
routine treatment only or to receive routine treatment and WMT. The frequency of 
WMT will be once a day for three consecutive days. Laboratory and imaging
examinations will be performed at admission, 1 and 2 weeks after treatment, and
on the day of discharge. Then a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 1st
week, 2nd week, and 6th month after discharge. The clinical efficacy and safety
of WMT in COVD-19 patients suspected of having GMD and the effects of WMT on the 
organ function, homeostasis, inflammatory response, intestinal mucosal barrier
function, and immunity of the patients will be evaluated.
RESULTS: By following the proposed protocol, WMT is expected to be efficacious
and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD, and the 
therapeutic effect is expected to be associated with improvement of the
intestinal mucosal barrier function, inflammatory response, and immunity.
CONCLUSION: The findings from this study may offer a new approach for the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD.
