COVID-19 pandemic has a major effect on world health, particularly on individuals
suffering from severe diseases or old aged persons. Various case studies revealed
that COVID-19 might increase the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD).
Coxsackievirus, dengue virus Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, Japanese
encephalitis, Western equine encephalomyelitis virus, West Nile virus, and human 
immunodeficiency virus have all been linked to the development of transient or
permanent parkinsonism, owing to the induction of neuroinflammation/hypoxic brain
injury with structural/functional damage within the basal ganglia. Coronavirus
mainly infects the alveolar cells and may lead to acute respiratory distress
syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 invades cells via the ACE2 receptor, which is widely
expressed in the central nervous system, where the virus may precipitate or
accelerate dementia. SARS-CoV-2 could enter the central nervous system directly
by the olfactory/vagus nerves or through the bloodstream. Here, we talked about
the importance of this viral infection in terms of the CNS as well as its
implications for people with Parkinson's disease; anosmia & olfaction-related
impairments in COVID-19 & PD patients. And, also discussed the role of vitamin D 
to sustain the progression of Parkinson's disease and the COVID-19; regular
vitamin D3 consumption of 2000-5000 IU/day may reduce the risk and severity of
COVID-19 in parkinsonian patients.
