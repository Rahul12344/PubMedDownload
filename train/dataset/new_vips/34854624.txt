1,5 years into the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 remains a dynamic and evolving disease.
Growing proportions of the population have been vaccinated, but what degree of
protection does vaccination actually offer, particularly in the face of an
evolving virus and the emergence of viral variants? Here we explore the limits of
vaccine protection -providing an overview of emerging data on how well vaccines
protect against mild and asymptomatic disease, vaccine effectiveness against the 
backdrop of variants such as the Delta, and the implications for SARS-CoV-2
transmission. We assess the continued risks for our vulnerable elderly and
immune-compromised patient populations, and whether emerging literature should
impact our diagnostic strategies.
