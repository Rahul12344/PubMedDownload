Natural immune response and protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

Margiotti K, Fabiani M, Mesoraca A, Giorlandino C.

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the
associated disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread
throughout the world, causing millions of infections and dead. One major question
in predicting the course of the COVID-19 pandemic is how well and how long the
immune response protect the host from reinfection. Although more studies are
needed, evidence suggests that virus-specific B cell response in people with
SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly generated and seems to be more reliable marker of
long-lasting humoral responses than serum antibodies. Here we reviewed all
related major studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 virus to better understand
the natural protection against the virus, and the risk of reinfection. The
ability of our community to eradicate this virus mostly will depend on our
knowledge on the immune response, critical not only for vaccine development and
distribution but also for therapeutic options. Keywords.
