Human immunodeficiency virus self-testing (HIVST) is an innovative and effective 
strategy important to the expansion of HIV testing coverage. Several innovative
implementations of HIVST have been developed and piloted among some HIV high-risk
populations like men who have sex with men (MSM) to meet the global testing
target. One innovative strategy is the secondary distribution of HIVST, in which 
individuals (defined as indexes) were given multiple testing kits for both
self-use (i.e.self-testing) and distribution to other people in their MSM social 
network (defined as alters). Studies about secondary HIVST distribution have
mainly concentrated on developing new intervention approaches to further increase
the effectiveness of this relatively new strategy from the perspective of
traditional public health discipline. There are many points of HIVST secondary
distribution in which mathematical modelling can play an important role. In this 
study, we considered secondary HIVST kits distribution in a resource-constrained 
situation and proposed two data-driven integer linear programming models to
maximize the overall economic benefits of secondary HIVST kits distribution based
on our present implementation data from Chinese MSM. The objective function took 
expansion of normal alters and detection of positive and newly-tested 'alters'
into account. Based on solutions from solvers, we developed greedy algorithms to 
find final solutions for our linear programming models. Results showed that our
proposed data-driven approach could improve the total health economic benefit of 
HIVST secondary distribution. This article is part of the theme issue 'Data
science approaches to infectious disease surveillance'.
