Background: With the rising number of new cases of COVID-19, understanding the
oxygen requirement of severe patients assists in identifying at risk groups and
in making an informed decision on building hospitals capacity in terms of oxygen 
facility arrangement. Therefore, the study aimed to estimate time to getting off 
supplemental oxygen therapy and identify predictors among COVID-19 patients
admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among 244 consecutively 
admitted COVID-19 patients from July to September, 2020. Kaplan Meier plots,
median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and
compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival
model was used to identify determinants of time to getting off supplemental
oxygen therapy, where hazard ratio (HR), P-value and 95%CI for HR were used for
testing significance and interpretation of results.
Results: Median time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied
population was 6 days (IQR,4.3-20.0). Factors that affect time to getting off
supplemental oxygen therapy were age group (AHR=0.52,95%CI=0.32,0.84,
p-value=0.008 for ≥70 years) and shortness of breath (AHR=0.71,95%CI=0.52,0.96,
p-value=0.026).
Conclusion: Average duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among
COVID-19 patients was 6 days and being 70 years and older and having shortness of
breath were found to be associated with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen
therapy requirement. This result can be used as a guide in planning institutional
resource allocation and patient management to provide a well-equipped care to
prevent complications and death from the disease.
