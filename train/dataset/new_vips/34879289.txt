Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito borne flaviviral zoonoses, causing fatal
disease in equines and humans. JE is endemic in most of the states of India with 
occurrence of human cases every year. The horses are not vaccinated against JE in
India and thus they are at more risk of acquiring the disease. Due to
nonavailability of indigenously developed ELISA and high cost of imported kits,
regular sero-surveillance is not being carried out to assess the true picture of 
JE virus in equine population of India. Therefore, a recombinant NS1 protein
based indirect IgG ELISA was developed with the objective to assess the
sero-positivity of JE virus in equine population of India. The diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of developed ELISA was 84.73% and 86.70%,
respectively. The validation studies revealed good reproducibility of ELISA with 
kappa value ranging from 0.75 to 1 between the results of different laboratories.
A total of 2,069 horse serum samples were screened using the developed ELISA and 
401 samples were positive for IgG against JEV with an overall sero-positivity of 
19.38% in equine population of India. A sero-positivity of 25.90% and 12.22% was 
recorded in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu-Kashmir, both hill states of North zone of
India for the first time, revealing the spread of virus to the nonendemic parts
of the country. The high sero-positivity of JE virus recorded in equine
population warrants the need for initiation of vaccination of horses in India to 
prevent the morbidity and mortality.
