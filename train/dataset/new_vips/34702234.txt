BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses mental health challenges to frontline
healthcare workers. Eye care professionals may be especially susceptible to
mental health problems due to high-risk exposures to patients. Yet, no prior
research has studied mental health issues among eye care professionals during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for mental
health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic among eye care professionals.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study among eye care professionals
and students in the United States and Canada from June 23 to July 8, 2020 during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 8505 eye care professionals and students
received email invitations to the survey and 2134 participated. We measured
mental health outcomes including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress
using validated scales, as well as potential risk factors including demographic
characteristics, state-level COVID-19 case counts, participants' patient
interactions, childcare responsibilities, and pre-pandemic stress levels. Linear 
multiple regression and logistic regression analyses were used to determine
relationships between risk factors and mental health outcomes.
RESULTS: We found that 38.4% of eyecare professional participants in the survey
met screening threshold as probable cases of anxiety, depression, or both during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for self-reported pre-pandemic stress level
and state COVID-19 case daily cases, significant risk factors for depression,
anxiety, and psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic included: being
female, younger age, and being Black or Asian. Interestingly, we found two
somewhat surprising protective factors against depression symptoms: more frequent
interactions with patients and having a greater proportion of childcare
responsibilities at home.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of mental health problems and
revealed disparities in mental health among eye care personnel and students:
Female, younger, Black, and Asian populations are particularly vulnerable to
mental health issues. These results indicate that it is critical to identify
mental health issues more effectively and develop interventions among this
population to address this significant and growing public health issue. The
strategies and policies should be reflective of the demographic disparities in
this vulnerable population.
