Identification of vulnerable sites defined by broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bNAbs) on HIV-1 envelope (Env) is crucial for vaccine design, and we present
here a vulnerable site defined by bNAb M4008_N1, which neutralizes about 40% of a
tier-2 virus panel. A 3.2 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of M4008_N1 in complex
with BG505 DS-SOSIP reveals a large, shallow protein epitope surface centered at 
the V3 crown of gp120 and surrounded by key glycans. M4008_N1 interacts with
gp120 primarily through its hammerhead CDR H3 to form a β-sheet interaction with 
the V3 crown hairpin. This makes M4008_N1 compatible with the closed conformation
of the prefusion Env trimer, and thus distinct from other known V3 crown mAbs.
This mode of bNAb approaching the immunogenic V3 crown in the native Env trimer
suggests a strategy for immunogen design targeting this site of vulnerability.
