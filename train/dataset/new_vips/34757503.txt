Ticks are blood-sucking arthropods that transmit many pathogens, including
arboviruses. Arboviruses transmitted by ticks are generally referred to as
tick-borne viruses (TBVs). TBVs are known to cause diseases in humans, pets, and 
livestock. There is, however, very limited information on the occurrence and
distribution of TBVs in sub-Saharan Africa. This study was designed to determine 
the presence and distribution of ticks infesting dogs and cattle in Ghana, as
well as to identify the tick-borne or tick-associated viruses they harbour. A
more diverse population of ticks was found to infest cattle (three genera)
relative to those infesting dogs (one genus). Six phleboviruses and an
orthonairovirus were detected in tick pools screened by RT-PCR. Subsequent
sequence analysis revealed two distinct phleboviruses and the previously reported
Odaw virus in ticks collected from dogs and a virus (16GH-T27) most closely
related to four unclassified phleboviruses in ticks collected from cattle. The
virus 16GH-T27 was considered a strain of Balambala tick virus (BTV) and named
BTV strain 16GH-T27. Next-generation sequencing analysis of the BTV-positive tick
pool detected only the L and S segments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BTV 
clustered with viruses previously defined as M-segment-deficient phleboviruses.
The orthonairovirus detected in ticks collected from cattle was confirmed to be
the medically important Dugbe virus. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of
understanding the presence and distribution of ticks and TBVs in disease
prevention and mitigation and the implications for public health. Our findings
contribute to the knowledge pool on TBVs and tick-associated viruses.
