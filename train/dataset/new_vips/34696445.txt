In summer 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 
detected on mink farms in Utah. An interagency One Health response was initiated 
to assess the extent of the outbreak and included sampling animals from on or
near affected mink farms and testing them for SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS
coronaviruses. Among the 365 animals sampled, including domestic cats, mink,
rodents, raccoons, and skunks, 261 (72%) of the animals harbored at least one
coronavirus. Among the samples that could be further characterized, 127
alphacoronaviruses and 88 betacoronaviruses (including 74 detections of
SARS-CoV-2 in mink) were identified. Moreover, at least 10% (n = 27) of the
coronavirus-positive animals were found to be co-infected with more than one
coronavirus. Our findings indicate an unexpectedly high prevalence of coronavirus
among the domestic and wild free-roaming animals tested on mink farms. These
results raise the possibility that mink farms could be potential hot spots for
future trans-species viral spillover and the emergence of new pandemic
coronaviruses.
