COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
addition to lung disease, clinical complications of COVID-19 include myocardial
damage and ischemia-related vascular disease. Severe manifestations and poor
prognosis in these patients are associated with a hypercoagulable state
predisposing to thrombotic-related complications and eventually death. However,
these clinical features can also occur in other forms of pneumonia, such as
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which, is also complicated by vascular
diseases and characterized by platelet activation. Platelets play a pivotal role 
in these settings as bacteria and viruses may induce activation via Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) in CAP patients and different and multiple pathways, including
ACE2-AngII axis and/or TLRs, in COVID-19 patients. Despite evidence confirming
the implication of platelet activation in both settings, their contribution to
the thrombotic process is still under investigation. Thus, in this review, we (1)
compare the thrombotic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and CAP, (2) analyze the 
putative mechanisms accounting for venous and arterial thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2
infection, and (3) discuss the potential anticoagulant armamentarium to
counteract thrombosis.
