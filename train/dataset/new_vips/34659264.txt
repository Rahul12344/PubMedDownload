The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely impacted daily life
all over the world. Any measures to slow down the spread of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to decrease disease severity 
are highly requested. Recent studies have reported inverse correlations between
plasma levels of vitamin D and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-19 severity. Therefore, it has been proposed to supplement the general
population with vitamin D to reduce the impact of COVID-19. However, by studying 
the course of COVID-19 and the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in a family
with a mutated, non-functional vitamin D receptor, we here demonstrate that
vitamin D signaling was dispensable for mounting an efficient adaptive immune
response against SARS-CoV-2 in this family. Although these observations might not
directly be transferred to the general population, they question a central role
of vitamin D in the generation of adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
