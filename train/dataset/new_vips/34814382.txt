Clinically, chronic hepatitis B and C are the main common chronic liver diseases 
that lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer, followed by drug-induced liver injury,
alcohol and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and autoimmune liver
disease in adult, but, by contrast, some special liver diseases, including
pregnancy-related liver disease, liver injury related to abnormal liver endocrine
function, adult hereditary liver disease, and hepatitis caused by
non-hepatotropic viruses are also gradually increasing. Early identification and 
diagnosis are the only accurate and timely manner treatment for these special
liver diseases.
