BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is affecting millions of people living in
rural areas of Low- and Middle-Income Countries and is causing an already
anticipated devastating effect on the health and economics of these populations. 
More information is needed to modify behaviors that may counterbalance the
consequences of mass spread of the virus in these underserved communities. This
study aimed to identify factors associated with a persistent SARS-CoV-2
seronegative status 1 year after a massive infection outbreak in middle-aged and 
older adults living in rural Ecuador.
METHODS: Individuals enrolled in the Atahualpa Project Cohort as of March 2020
received 5 rounds of tests for determination of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood.
Individuals who remained seronegative up to April 2021 were considered
"persistently seronegative." An adjusted Poisson regression model was fitted to
estimate the incidence risk ratio of factors directly or inversely associated
with a persistent seronegative status.
RESULTS: A total of 673 individuals received baseline tests. Thirty-one declined 
consent or died and 429 seroconverted, leaving 213 seronegative subjects. Average
SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate was 9.87 events (95% C.I.: 8.91-10.83) per
100 person-months of observation. The use of flushing toilet systems (instead of 
open latrines) increased 1.5 times the possibility of remaining seronegative.
Likewise, every additional bedroom in the house increased by 15% the possibility 
of remaining seronegative. In contrast, every additional person in the house and 
having high cholesterol levels significantly reduced the possibility of remaining
seronegative.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of flushing toilet systems and the number of bedrooms in the
house directly influenced the possibility of remaining seronegative among
individuals living in this rural setting. Study results also demonstrated a
sustained transmission of the virus even after a significant proportion of the
population has been infected. Our findings reinforce the mass spread of
SARS-CoV-2 in rural communities.
