In recent decades, the use of engineered nanoparticles has been increasing in
various sectors, including biomedicine, diagnosis, water treatment, and
environmental remediation leading to significant public concerns. Among these
nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have gained many attentions in
medicine, pharmacology, drug delivery system, molecular imaging, and bio-sensing 
due to their various properties. In addition, various studies have reviewed MNPs 
main applications in the biomedical engineering area with intense progress and
recent achievements. Nanoparticles, especially the magnetic nanoparticles, have
recently been confirmed with excellent antiviral activity against different
viruses, including SARS-CoV-2(Covid-19) and their recent development against
Covid-19 also has also been discussed. This review aims to highlight the recent
development of the magnetic nanoparticles and their biomedical applications such 
as diagnosis of diseases, molecular imaging, hyperthermia, bio-sensing, gene
therapy, drug delivery and the diagnosis of Covid-19.
