The outbreak of new infectious diseases is threatening human survival.
Transmission of such diseases is determined by several factors, with climate
being a very important factor. This study was conducted to assess the correlation
between the occurrence of infectious diseases and climatic factors using data
from the Sentinel Surveillance System and meteorological data from Gwangju,
Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea. The climate of Gwangju from June to September is
humid, with this city having the highest average temperature, whereas that from
December to February is cold and dry. Infection rates of Salmonella (temperature:
r = 0.710**; relative humidity: r = 0.669**), E. coli (r = 0.617**; r = 0.626**),
rotavirus (r =  - 0.408**; r =  - 0.618**), norovirus (r =  - 0.463**;
r =  - 0.316**), influenza virus (r =  - 0.726**; r =  - 0.672**), coronavirus
(r =  - 0.684**; r =  - 0.408**), and coxsackievirus (r = 0.654**; r = 0.548**)
have been shown to have a high correlation with seasonal changes, specifically in
these meteorological factors. Pathogens showing distinct seasonality in the
occurrence of infection were observed, and there was a high correlation with the 
climate characteristics of Gwangju. In particular, viral diseases show strong
seasonality, and further research on this matter is needed. Due to the current
COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine and prevention have become important to block the
spread of infectious diseases. For this purpose, studies that predict infectivity
through various types of data related to infection are important.
