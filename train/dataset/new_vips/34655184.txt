Environmental Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 for Internal Quality Management in a
Clinical Laboratory.

BACKGROUND: As an emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) exhibits occult infection, which might cause difficulties in
controlling disease spread. The possibility of aerosol transmission in a
relatively closed environment contributes to the high infectivity of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in hospitals. This study presents
an environmental surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 that is suitable for a
clinical laboratory and may also lead to further assessment of infection
prevention programs in different departments in hospitals.
METHODS: The study was performed in a SARS-CoV-2 RNA laboratory involved in the
diagnosis of COVID-19 in China. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assays were used to detect viral pathogens. Standard operating
procedures (SOPs) for monitoring infectious pathogens were developed in this
study.
RESULTS: In total, more than 180 air and surface samples were tested for
SARS-CoV-2 to determine whether the virus was present at the airborne and
particle level. The employed molecular method effectively identified
environmental contamination.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that regular environmental surveillance is
critical in a clinical PCR laboratory. The presented strategy could also be used 
for monitoring and surveillance in negative pressure wards and clinics in
hospitals to prevent hospital-acquired infections.
