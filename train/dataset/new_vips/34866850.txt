Cyproterone acetate (CPA), a hydroxyprogesterone derivative, is used to treat
advanced prostate cancer and infrequently in women for acne, breast cancer and
hirsutism. Transient mild elevation in levels of liver enzymes is reported in
10-30% of patients, and acute liver failure (ALF) is uncommon. Here, we discuss
the first case of CPA-induced ALF from India and the available literature.
