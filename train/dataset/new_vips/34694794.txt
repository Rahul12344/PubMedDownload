Rapid and inexpensive serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are needed to
conduct population-level seroprevalence surveillance studies and can improve
diagnostic reliability when used in combination with viral tests. Here, we report
a novel low-cost electrochemical capillary-flow device to quantify IgG antibodies
targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins (anti-N antibody) down to 5 ng/mL in
low-volume (10 μL) human whole blood samples in under 20 min. No sample
preparation is needed as the device integrates a blood-filtration membrane for
on-board plasma extraction. The device is made of stacked layers of a hydrophilic
polyester and double-sided adhesive films, which create a passive microfluidic
circuit that automates the steps of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The sample and reagents are sequentially delivered to a nitrocellulose membrane
that is modified with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. When present
in the sample, anti-N antibodies are captured on the nitrocellulose membrane and 
detected via chronoamperometry performed on a screen-printed carbon electrode. As
a result of this quantitative electrochemical readout, no result interpretation
is required, making the device ideal for point-of-care (POC) use by non-trained
users. Moreover, we show that the device can be coupled to a near-field
communication potentiostat operated from a smartphone, confirming its true POC
potential. The novelty of this work resides in the integration of sensitive
electrochemical detection with capillary-flow immunoassay, providing accuracy at 
the point of care. This novel electrochemical capillary-flow device has the
potential to aid the diagnosis of infectious diseases at the point of care.
