Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface transmembrane receptor
that mediates the tyrosine signaling pathway to carry the extracellular messages 
inside the cell and thereby alter the function of nucleus. This leads to the
generation of various protein products to up or downregulate the cellular
function. It is encoded by cell erythroblastosis virus oncogene B1, so called
C-erb B1/ERBB2/HER-2 gene that acts as a proto-oncogene. It belongs to the HER-2 
receptor-family in breast cancer and responds best with anti-Herceptin therapy
(anti-tyrosine kinase monoclonal antibody). HER-2 positive breast cancer patient 
exhibits worse prognosis without Herceptin therapy. Similar incidence and
prognosis are reported in other epithelial neoplasms like EGFR + lung non-small
cell carcinoma and glioblastoma (grade IV brain glial tumor). Present study
highlights the role and connectivity of EGF with various cancers via signaling
pathways, cell surface receptors mechanism, macromolecules, mitochondrial genes
and neoplasm. Present study describes the EGFR associated gene expression
profiling (in breast cancer and NSCLC), relation between mitrochondrial genes and
carcinoma, and several in vitro and in vivo models to screen the synergistic
effect of various combination treatments. According to this study, although
clinical studies including targeted treatments, immunotherapies, radiotherapy,
TKi-EGFR combined targeted therapy have been carried out to investigate the
synergism of combination therapy; however still there is a gap to apply the
scenarios of experimental and clinical studies for further developments. This
review will give an idea about the transition from experimental to most advanced 
clinical studies with different combination drug strategies to treat cancer.
