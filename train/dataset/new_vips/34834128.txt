Plants consistently synthesize and accumulate medically valuable secondary
metabolites which can be isolated and clinically tested under in vitro
conditions. An advancement with such important phytochemical production has been 
recognized and utilized as herbal drugs. Bioactive andrographolide (AGL;
C20H30O5) isolated from Andrographis paniculate (AP) (Kalmegh) is a diterpenoid
lactones having multifunctional medicinal properties including anti-manic,
anti-inflammatory, liver, and lung protective. AGL is known for its
immunostimulant activity against a variety of microbial infections thereby,
regulating classical and alternative macrophage activation, Ag-specific antibody 
production during immune disorder therapy. In vitro studies with AGL found it to 
be effective against multiple tumors, neuronal disorders, diabetes, pneumonia,
fibrosis, and other diverse therapeutic misadventures. Generally, virus-based
diseases like ZIKA, influenza A virus subtype (H1NI), Ebola (EBOV), Dengue
(DENV), and coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics have greatly increased scientific
interest and demands to develop more effective and economical immunomodulating
drugs with minimal side effects. Trials and in vitro pharmacological studies with
AGL and medicinally beneficial herbs might contribute to benefit the human
population without using chemical-based synthetic drugs. In this review, we have 
discussed the possible role of AGL as a promising herbal-chemo remedy during
human diseases, viral infections and as an immunity booster.
