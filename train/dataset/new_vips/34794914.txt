INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] is a
lentevirus, primarily infects certain cells of the immune system, thereby greatly
weakens the body's own defenses against diseases. This study was aimed to explore
the value and significance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the assessment of patients with
HIV infection and to examine the presence of quantitative alterations in 18F-FDG 
uptake among patients with HIV-related infections or malignant diseases in
HIV-positive patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with HIV infection were scanned on PET/CT
system. The data were registered according to immune status, antiretroviral
therapy, and definitive diagnosis. All pathologic lesions and disease related
areas were described, 18F-FDG uptake patterns were evaluated. Semiquantitative
analysis of 18F-FDG uptake was performed and SUVmax were calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients [70%] were diagnosed with HIV-related infection or
malignant diseases. The sensitivity of PET/CT was shown to be 100% and the
specificity 92% for concomitant diseases requiring additional treatment to
antiretroviral therapy. The SUVmax and CD4 counts were not statistically
different between HIV-related reactive lymphadenopathy, HIV-related malignancy,
and HIV-related infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of distribution of nodal/extranodal uptake on 18F-FDG
PET/CT may facilitate distinction between HIV-related generalized
lymphadenopathies, HIV-related opportunistic infections, and malignancies. In
this context, 18F-FDG PET/CT should be preferred for routine use in the
management of patients infected with HIV.
