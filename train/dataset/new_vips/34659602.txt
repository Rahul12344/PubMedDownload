There are rising concerns among the medical community and the public regarding
the side effects of different vaccines developed throughout the world and their
short and long-term effects, particularly COVID19 vaccines. Most notably,
post-vaccination demyelinating diseases such as acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and multiple sclerosis relapses have been
reported. We present a case of a 32-year-old male who presented with a 2 weeks
history of acute confusional state and imbalance 1 week after receiving the
second dose of COVID19 vaccination. MRI findings showed typical distribution of
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and the patient was positive for AQP4 IgG.
The pathogenesis behind developing neuromyelitis optica and vaccines is still
unknown. Few case reports have been reported of post-vaccination neuromyelitis
optica spectrum disorder but to our knowledge, this would be the first case
published of neuromyelitis optica following exposure to COVID19 vaccine.
