BACKGROUND AND AIM: Seasonal influenza exerts a deep and multi-level impact on
population and public health systems. Among at risk groups, healthcare workers
(HCWs) represent a crucial one due to the threat of absenteeism and consequent
disruption of healthcare services (and economic losses). Also in this group
vaccine hesitancy is a well known issue, therefore innovative and 360-degree
strategies are urgently needed to overcome the problem.
METHODS: in the 2020-21 influenza vaccination campaign in a research and teaching
hospital in Milan, Italy, the working group implemented three different
strategies: the offer of vaccination through both an ad hoc ambulatory and
several itinerant (on site) vaccinating teams, a promotional and educational
communication campaign, a gaming strategy Results: vaccinated employees nearly
doubled (2103 vs 1153 in 2019-20 flu vaccination campaign), reaching a
comprehensive vaccination coverage rate (VCR) of 43,1%. A highly significant
increase in the 40-59 age group was registered. While physicians and nursing
staff confirmed to be the most represented categories among vaccinated subjects, 
administrative and auxiliary staffs performed the greatest increase compared to
the previous campaign. The on site vaccination was clearly preferred than the ad 
hoc one (1693 HCWs, 80,5% vs 410, 19,5%). Vaccinated for the first time
registered a significant increase (40,2% vs 36,2% in 2019-20 campaign).
CONCLUSIONS: such meaningful results confirm the effectiveness of the strategies 
implemented in the present campaign, suggesting their possible application in the
debated COVID19-third-dose vaccination campaign.
