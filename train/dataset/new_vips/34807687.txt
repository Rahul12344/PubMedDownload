The COVID-19 pandemic has presented families around the world with extraordinary 
challenges related to physical and mental health, economic security, social
support, and education. The current study capitalizes on a longitudinal,
cross-national study of parenting, adolescent development, and young adult
competence to document the association between personal disruption during the
pandemic and reported changes in internalizing and externalizing behavior in
young adults and their mothers since the pandemic began. It further investigates 
whether family functioning during adolescence 3 years earlier moderates this
association. Data from 484 families in five countries (Italy, the Philippines,
Sweden, Thailand, and the United States) reveal that higher levels of reported
disruption during the pandemic are related to reported increases in internalizing
and externalizing behaviors after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for young
adults (Mage = 20) and their mothers in all five countries, with the exception of
one association in Thailand. Associations between disruption during the pandemic 
and young adults' and their mothers' reported increases in internalizing and
externalizing behaviors were attenuated by higher levels of youth disclosure,
more supportive parenting, and lower levels of destructive adolescent-parent
conflict prior to the pandemic. This work has implications for fostering
parent-child relationships characterized by warmth, acceptance, trust, open
communication, and constructive conflict resolution at all times given their
protective effects for family resilience during times of crisis. (PsycInfo
