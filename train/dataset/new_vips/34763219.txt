BACKGROUND: Internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for health anxiety has 
demonstrated efficacy but has not been evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This study presents the first evaluation of the uptake and outcomes of iCBT for
health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: THIS WAY UP is an Australian digital mental health service which
delivers iCBT interventions to community members. We compared the uptake of THIS 
WAY UP's iCBT course for health anxiety in an Australian adult sample who started
the course before the pandemic (12th September 2019-11 th March 2020) to during
the pandemic (12th March to 11th June 2020). The course was accessible to
Australian adults over 18 years old, with no inclusion criteria. Outcomes
included course registrations and commencements, lesson and course completion,
and self-reported health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory), depression
(Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item) and distress (Kessler-10).
RESULTS: From March to June 2020, we observed significant increases in course
registrations (N = 238 vs N = 1057); and course commencements (N = 126 vs.
N = 778). Large, significant improvements in health anxiety (g = 0.89), and
distress (K10: g = 0.91), and medium improvements in depression (g = 0.55) were
found. Course completion during COVID was 30.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: iCBT improved health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
provides scalable intervention that can address increased demands for mental
health services in the community.
