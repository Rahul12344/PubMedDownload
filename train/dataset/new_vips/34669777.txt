Using data collected by the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey - COVID-19
(PNAD-COVID19) and semi-Bayesian modelling developed by Wu et al., we have
estimated the effect of underreporting of COVID-19 cases in Brazil as of December
2020. The total number of infected individuals is about 3 to 8 times the number
of cases reported, depending on the state. Confirmed cases are at 3.1% of the
total population and our estimate of total cases is at almost 15% of the
approximately 212 million Brazilians as of 2020. The method we adopted from Wu et
al., with slight modifications in prior specifications, applies bias corrections 
to account for incomplete testing and imperfect test accuracy. Our estimates,
which are comparable to results obtained by Wu et al. for the United States,
indicate that projections from compartmental models (such as SEIR models) tend to
overestimate the number of infections and that there is considerable regional
heterogeneity (results are presented by state).
