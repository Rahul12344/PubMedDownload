Massive additional quantities of disinfectants have been applied during the
COVID-19 pandemic as infection preventive and control measures. While the
application of disinfectants plays a key role in preventing the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of disinfectants applied during the ongoing
pandemic on non-target organisms remain unknown. Here we collated evidence from
multiple studies showing that chemicals used for major disinfectant products can 
induce hormesis in various organisms, such as plants, animal cells, and
microorganisms, when applied singly or in mixtures, suggesting potential
ecological risks at sub-threshold doses that are normally considered safe. Among 
other effects, sub-threshold doses of disinfectant chemicals can enhance the
proliferation and pathogenicity of pathogenic microbes, enhancing the development
and spread of drug resistance. We opine that hormesis should be considered when
evaluating the effects and risks of such disinfectants, especially since the
linear-no-threshold (LNT) and threshold dose-response models cannot identify or
predict their effects.
