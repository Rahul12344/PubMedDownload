African swine fever (ASF), caused by a DNA virus (ASFV) belonging to genus
Asfivirus of the Asfarviridae family, is one of the most threatening diseases of 
suids. During last few years, it has spread among populations of wild boars and
pigs in countries of Eastern and Central Europe, causing huge economical losses. 
While local ASF occurrence is positively correlated with wild boar density,
ecology of this species (social structure, movement behavior) constrains
long-range disease transmission. Thus, it has been speculated that carnivores
known for high daily movement and long-range dispersal ability, such as the wolf 
(Canis lupus), may be indirect ASFV vectors. To test this, we analyzed 62 wolf
fecal samples for the presence of ASFV DNA, collected mostly in parts of Poland
declared as ASF zones. This dataset included 20 samples confirmed to contain wild
boar remains, 13 of which were collected near places where GPS-collared wolves
fed on dead wild boars. All analyzed fecal samples were ASFV-negative. On the
other hand, eight out of nine wild boar carcasses that were fed on by
telemetrically studied wolves were positive. Thus, our results suggest that when 
wolves consume meat of ASFV-positive wild boars, the virus does not survive the
passage through intestinal tract. Additionally, wolves may limit ASFV
transmission by removing infectious carrion. We speculate that in areas where
telemetric studies on large carnivores are performed, data from GPS collars could
be used to enhance efficiency of carcass search, which is one of the main
preventive measures to constrain ASF spread.
