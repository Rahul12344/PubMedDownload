In the frames of a One Health strategy, i.e. a strategy should be able to predict
susceptibility to infection in both humans and animals, developing a SARS-CoV-2
mutation tracking system is a goal. We observed that the phylogenetic proximity
of vertebrate ACE2 receptors does not affect the binding energy for the viral
spike protein. However, all viral variants seem to bind ACE2 better in many
animals than in humans. Moreover, two observations highlight that the evolution
of the virus started at the beginning of 2020 and culminated with the appearance 
of the variants. First, codon usage analysis shows that the B.1.1.7 (alpha),
B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, similar in the use of codons, are 
also similar to a virus sampled in January 2020. Second, the host-specific D614G 
mutation becomes prevalent starting from March 2020. Overall, we show that
SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a process of molecular evolution that begins with the
optimization of codons followed by the functional optimization of the spike
protein.
