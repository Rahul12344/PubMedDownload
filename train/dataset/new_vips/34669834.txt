OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of recurrent wheezing (RW) in preterm
infants who received prophylaxis against severe infection with respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and to identify genetic susceptibility (atopy or asthma)
and risk factors for RW.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving preterm infants who received 
prophylaxis with palivizumab at a referral center in Brazil during the first two 
years of age. A structured questionnaire was administered in a face-to-face
interview with parents or legal guardians.
RESULTS: The study included 410 preterm infants (median age = 9 months [0-24
months]). In the sample as a whole, 111 children (27.1%; [95% CI, 22.9-31.5]) had
RW. The univariate analysis between the groups with and without RW showed no
differences regarding the following variables: sex, ethnicity, maternal level of 
education, gestational age, birth weight, breastfeeding, number of children in
the household, day care center attendance, pets in the household, and smoking
caregiver. The prevalence of RW was twice as high among children with
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (adjusted OR = 2.08; 95% CI, 1.11-3.89; p = 0.022) and
almost five times as high among those with a personal/family history of atopy
(adjusted OR = 4.96; 95% CI, 2.62-9.39; p < 0.001) as among those without these
conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants who received prophylaxis with palivizumab but have a
personal/family history of atopy or bronchopulmonary dysplasia are more likely to
have RW than do those without these conditions.
