Antibody production following vaccination can provide protective immunity to
subsequent infection by pathogens such as influenza viruses. However,
circumstances where antibody formation is impaired after vaccination, such as in 
older people, require us to better understand the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that underpin successful vaccination in order to improve vaccine
design for at-risk groups. Here, by studying the breadth of anti-haemagglutinin
(HA) IgG, serum cytokines, and B and T cell responses by flow cytometry before
and after influenza vaccination, we show that formation of circulating T
follicular helper (cTfh) cells was associated with high-titre antibody responses.
Using Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) class II tetramers, we demonstrate
that HA-specific cTfh cells can derive from pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells and 
have a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. In older people, the
differentiation of HA-specific cells into cTfh cells was impaired. This
age-dependent defect in cTfh cell formation was not due to a contraction of the
TCR repertoire, but rather was linked with an increased inflammatory gene
signature in cTfh cells. Together, this suggests that strategies that temporarily
dampen inflammation at the time of vaccination may be a viable strategy to boost 
optimal antibody generation upon immunisation of older people.
