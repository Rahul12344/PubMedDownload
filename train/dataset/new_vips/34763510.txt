BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether Arbidol has a good
antiviral effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in one of the treatment
centers for COVID-19 patients in China from January 2020 to March 2020. The
antiviral drug Arbidol (ARB) was administrated to some of the patients at 0.2 g
tid po for 7 to 10 days. According to whether patients were given ARB, they were 
divided into 2 groups: the ARB group and the Non-ARB group. The primary outcome
was the 14-day COVID-19 negativity rate.
RESULTS: Of 146 patients, 140 were included. A total of 79 (56.4%) patients
received ARB during hospitalization. In the overall cohort, the time of COVID-19 
negativity in the ARB group compared with the Non-ARB group was 12.9 days versus 
12.7 days (P=0.175; >0.05). The rates of 14-day COVID-19 negativity were 60.8%
and 65.6% in the ARB and non-ARB groups, respectively (P=0.559; >0.05). Using an 
adjusted model, there were no obvious differences in the time of COVID-19
negativity and the rates of 14-day COVID-19 negativity (P>0.05). According to
Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probabilities of 14-day COVID-19 negativity were
similar in the 2 groups (log-rank P=0.130; >0.05). In a multivariate Cox
analysis, the variables of age [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.83 to 0.99; P=0.039] and glucose (HR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.98; P=0.021)
were independently associated with 14-day COVID-19 negativity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there was no apparent favorable clinical
response with ARB both in clinical symptoms and the 14-day COVID-19 negativity
rate.
