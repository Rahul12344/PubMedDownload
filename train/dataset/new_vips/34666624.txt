ABSTRACTDomestic and family violence is a social and public health issue
typically positioned in policy frameworks as a consequence of gendered social and
economic structures. In this paper, we deploy an approach that draws on HÃ¶rl's
neo-ecological thinking to propose that the home, as a site of domestic violence,
can be usefully framed as an ecology of the domestic, a posthumanist hybrid
matrix of bodies, spaces and objects in which various practices enact the smooth 
running of the domestic together with practices of domestic and family violence, 
including coercive control. Our interest is in coercive control and in the impact
that the COVID-19 pandemic had on practices which enact this aspect of domestic
violence. Our exploration of the practices that enact coercive control draws on
the work of Law and others. We examine how practices, which are not compatible,
or that do not cohere, are able to coexist in a domestic ecology and what occurs 
when there is a disruption as occurred with the pandemic.
