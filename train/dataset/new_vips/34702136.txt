Due to the increasing amount of new information that is emerging about COVID-19, 
traditional and web-based information sources are commonly used to spread and
seek information. This study compared differences in information seeking, trust
of information sources, and use of protective behaviors (e.g., mask wearing)
among individuals in the US and China during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of
722 valid responses in the US and 493 valid responses in China were collected via
online surveys in May 2020. Pearson's Chi-square tests, independent samples
t-tests, and multiple linear regressions were used to conduct the analyses.
Results showed that US respondents accessed significantly fewer COVID-19
information sources, rated significantly lower levels of trust in these sources, 
and reported significantly lower levels of protective behaviors than the Chinese 
respondents. In both countries, trust in newspapers, radio/community
broadcasting, and news portals were significantly positively correlated with
protective behaviors. While trust of TV was significant in both populations, in
China it was positively correlated, whereas in the US was negatively correlated, 
with protective behaviors. Findings from this study showed that coordinated and
consistent messages from governmental officials, health authorities, and media
platforms are important to promote and encourage protective behaviors.
