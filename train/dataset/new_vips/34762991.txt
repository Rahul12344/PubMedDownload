Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection causes a severe disease of pigs,
resulting in significant economic losses. The CSFV NS4B protein is crucial for
viral replication and pathogenicity. Interleukin 8 (IL-8), a main chemokine, is
induced by multiple cell types and plays an essential role in host defense
mechanisms against numerous viruses. It has been reported that NS4A of CSFV is
involved in the induction of IL-8 expression in swine umbilical vein endothelial 
cells. However, the effect of CSFV NS4B on IL-8 expression is unknown. In this
study, we showed that CSFV NS4B inhibited IL-8 expression in porcine alveolar
macrophages (PAMs), and NS4B inhibited mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein 
(MAVS)-induced IL-8 expression. Moreover, CSFV NS4B interacted with MAVS.
However, NS4B did not alter MAVS expression. Subsequently, we demonstrated that
IRF3 knockdown or NF-κB inhibition reduced MAVS-induced IL-8 expression.
Furthermore, the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways were activated by MAVS expression.
However, CSFV NS4B inhibited MAVS-mediated NF-κB activation and IRF3 expression. 
Finally, CSFV NS4B inhibited IRF3 expression. Our findings reveal that CSFV NS4B 
interacts with MAVS and inhibits IL-8 expression by blocking the activation of
IRF3 and NF-κB. Taken together, this study provides insights into the mechanism
of NS4B-inhibited IL-8 expression.
