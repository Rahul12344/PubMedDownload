The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemics caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading around the
world due to its high infection rate, long incubation period, as well as lack of 
effective diagnosis and therapy or vaccines, which is tearing global health
systems apart. It is an urgent demand for point-of-care diagnosis and effective
treatment to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Currently, based on the rapid
development of functional materials with unique physicochemical features through 
advanced fabrication and chemical modification, nanomaterials provide an emerging
tool to detect SARS-CoV-2, inhibit the interplay in the virus and host cell
interface, and enhance host immune response. In our manuscript, we summarized
recent advances of nanomaterials for the diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19. The
limitation, current challenges, and perspectives for the nano-diagnosis and
nano-therapy of COVID-19 are proposed. The review is expected to enable
researchers to understand the effect of nanomaterials for the diagnosis and
therapy of COVID-19 and may catalyze breakthroughs in this area.
