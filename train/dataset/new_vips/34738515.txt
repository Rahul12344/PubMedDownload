IntroductionNumerous CE-marked SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag RDT)
are offered in Europe, several of them with unconfirmed quality claims.AimWe
performed an independent head-to-head evaluation of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2
Ag RDT offered in Germany.MethodsWe addressed the sensitivity of 122 Ag RDT in
direct comparison using a common evaluation panel comprised of 50 specimens.
Minimum sensitivity of 75% for panel specimens with a PCR quantification cycle
(Cq) ≤ 25 was used to identify Ag RDT eligible for reimbursement in the German
healthcare system.ResultsThe sensitivity of different SARS-CoV-2 Ag RDT varied
over a wide range. The sensitivity limit of 75% for panel members with Cq ≤ 25
was met by 96 of the 122 tests evaluated; 26 tests exhibited lower sensitivity,
few of which failed completely. Some RDT exhibited high sensitivity, e.g. 97.5 % 
for Cq < 30.ConclusionsThis comparative evaluation succeeded in distinguishing
less sensitive from better performing Ag RDT. Most of the evaluated Ag RDT
appeared to be suitable for fast identification of acute infections associated
with high viral loads. Market access of SARS-CoV-2 Ag RDT should be based on
minimal requirements for sensitivity and specificity.
