OBJECTIVE: Although social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality by race, gender and
socioeconomic status are well documented, less is known about social disparities 
in infection rates and their shift over time. We aim to study the evolution of
social disparities in infection at the early stage of the epidemic in France with
regard to the policies implemented.
DESIGN: Random population-based prospective cohort.
SETTING: From May to June 2020 in France.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults included in the Epidémiologie et Conditions de Vie cohort
(n=77 588).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported anosmia and/or ageusia in three categories: 
no symptom, during the first epidemic peak (in March 2020) or thereafter (during 
lockdown).
RESULTS: In all, 2052 participants (1.53%) reported anosmia/ageusia. The social
distribution of exposure factors (density of place of residence, overcrowded
housing and working outside the home) was described. Multinomial regressions were
used to identify changes in social variables (gender, class and race) associated 
with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia. Women were more likely to report symptoms
during the peak and after. Racialised minorities accumulated more exposure risk
factors than the mainstream population and were at higher risk of anosmia/ageusia
during the peak and after. By contrast, senior executive professionals were the
least exposed to the virus with the lower rate of working outside the home during
lockdown. They were more affected than lower social classes at the peak of the
epidemic, but this effect disappeared after the peak.
CONCLUSION: The shift in the social profile of the epidemic was related to a
shift in exposure factors under the implementation of a stringent stay-at-home
order. Our study shows the importance to consider in a dynamic way the gender,
socioeconomic and race direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
notably to implement policies that do not widen health inequalities.
