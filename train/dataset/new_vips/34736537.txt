BACKGROUND: Despite the expectations regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine
(CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) management, 
concerns about their adverse events have remained.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the safety of
CQ and HCQ from malarial and non-malarial randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
METHODS: The primary outcomes were the frequencies of serious adverse events
(SAEs), retinopathy, and cardiac complications. Search strategies were applied to
MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Trip databases. We used a
random-effects model to pool results across studies and Peto's one-step odds
ratio (OR) for event rates below 1%. Both-armed zero-event studies were excluded 
from the meta-analyses. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation system to evaluate the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: One hundred and six RCTs were included. We found no significant
difference between CQ/HCQ and control (placebo or non-CQ/HCQ) in the frequency of
SAEs (OR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-1.26, 33 trials, 15,942
participants, moderate certainty of evidence). However, there was a moderate
certainty of evidence that CQ/HCQ increases the incidence of cardiac
complications (RR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.10-2.38, 16 trials, 9908 participants). No
clear relationship was observed between CQ/HCQ and retinopathy (OR: 1.63, 95% CI:
- 0.4-6.57, 5 trials, 344 participants, very low certainty of evidence).
CONCLUSIONS: CQ and HCQ probably do not increase SAEs, with low frequency of
these adverse events on malarial and non-malarial conditions. However, they may
increase cardiac complications especially in patients with COVID-19. No clear
effect of their use on the incidence of retinopathy was observed.
