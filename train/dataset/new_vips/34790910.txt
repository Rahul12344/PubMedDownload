CellPAINT is an interactive digital tool that allows non-expert users to create
illustrations of the molecular structure of cells and viruses. We present a new
release with several key enhancements, including the ability to generate custom
ingredients from structure information in the Protein Data Bank, and interaction,
grouping, and locking functions that streamline the creation of assemblies and
illustration of large, complex scenes. An example of CellPAINT as a tool for
hypothesis generation in the interpretation of cryoelectron tomograms is
presented. CellPAINT is freely available at http://ccsb.scripps.edu/cellpaint.
