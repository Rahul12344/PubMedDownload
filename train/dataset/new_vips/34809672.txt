BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether screening for sepsis using an electronic alert 
in hospitalized ward patients improves outcomes. The objective of the
Stepped-wedge Cluster Randomized Trial of Electronic Early Notification of Sepsis
in Hospitalized Ward Patients (SCREEN) trial is to evaluate whether an electronic
screening for sepsis compared to no screening among hospitalized ward patients
reduces all-cause 90-day in-hospital mortality.
METHODS AND DESIGN: This study is designed as a stepped-wedge cluster randomized 
trial in which the unit of randomization or cluster is the hospital ward. An
electronic alert for sepsis was developed in the electronic medical record (EMR),
with the feature of being active (visible to treating team) or masked (inactive
in EMR frontend for the treating team but active in the backend of the EMR).
Forty-five clusters in 5 hospitals are randomized into 9 sequences of 5 clusters 
each to receive the intervention (active alert) over 10 periods, 2 months each,
the first being the baseline period. Data are extracted from EMR and are compared
between the intervention (active alert) and control group (masked alert). During 
the study period, some of the hospital wards were allocated to manage patients
with COVID-19. The primary outcome of all-cause hospital mortality by day 90 will
be compared using a generalized linear mixed model with a binary distribution and
a log-link function to estimate the relative risk as a measure of effect. We will
include two levels of random effects to account for nested clustering within
wards and periods and two levels of fixed effects: hospitals and COVID-19 ward
status in addition to the intervention. Results will be expressed as relative
risk with a 95% confidence interval.
CONCLUSION: The SCREEN trial provides an opportunity for a novel trial design and
analysis of routinely collected and entered data to evaluate the effectiveness of
an intervention (alert) for a common medical problem (sepsis in ward patients).
In this statistical analysis plan, we outline details of the planned analyses in 
advance of trial completion. Prior specification of the statistical methods and
outcome analysis will facilitate unbiased analyses of these important clinical
data.
