Strict safety procedures including lockdowns were adopted during the Corona virus
(COVID-19) pandemic worldwide which might have influenced mental and physical
health in affected communities. This study aimed to investigate the level of
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its correlates among individuals with 
stroke in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study
with a self-administered questionnaire, which included demographics, 12-item
Short Form (SF-12) health survey, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), and 
The Stroke Impact Scale 16 (SIS-16). Descriptive analyses were used to summarize 
study data. Factors significantly correlated with HRQoL were determined using
Pearson correlation. A total of 97 individuals successfully completed the study
with a mean age of 57.9 years (Â±57.9). The level of HRQoL (measured by SF-12) was
significantly and negatively associated with mental health symptoms (depression, 
anxiety, and stress) and the stroke recovery subscale of the SIS-16. Furthermore,
participants' HRQoL level was significantly and positively associated with
participants' age, stroke chronicity, receiving rehabilitation, and amount of
help asked from caregivers. Jordanians with stroke demonstrated a relatively low 
level of HRQoL and high levels of mental health symptoms during the COVID-19
pandemic. Healthcare administrators should carefully consider individuals with
stroke HRQoL and its correlates while planning for future crises.
