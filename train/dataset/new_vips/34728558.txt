BACKGROUND: Whether infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes
schizophrenia - and whether the associated risk reverses after anti-HCV therapy -
is unknown; we aimed to investigate these topics.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study using the
Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (TNHIRD). A diagnosis of
schizophrenia was based on criteria from the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th revision (295.xx).
RESULTS: From 2003 to 2012, from a total population of 19 298 735, we enrolled 3 
propensity-score-matched cohorts (1:2:2): HCV-treated (8931 HCV-infected patients
who had received interferon-based therapy for ≥ 6 months); HCV-untreated (17
862); and HCV-uninfected (17 862) from the TNHIRD. Of the total sample (44 655), 
82.81% (36 980) were 40 years of age or older. Of the 3 cohorts, the
HCV-untreated group had the highest 9-year cumulative incidence of schizophrenia 
(0.870%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.556%-1.311%; p < 0.001); the HCV-treated 
(0.251%, 95% CI 0.091%-0.599%) and HCV-uninfected (0.118%, 95% CI 0.062%-0.213%) 
cohorts showed similar cumulative incidence of schizophrenia (p = 0.33).
Multivariate Cox analyses showed that HCV positivity (hazard ratio [HR] 3.469,
95% CI 2.168-5.551) was independently associated with the development of
schizophrenia. The HCV-untreated cohort also had the highest cumulative incidence
of overall mortality (20.799%, 95% CI 18.739%-22.936%; p < 0.001); the
HCV-treated (12.518%, 95% CI 8.707%-17.052%) and HCV uninfected (6.707%, 95% CI
5.533%-8.026%) cohorts showed similar cumulative incidence of mortality (p =
0.12).
LIMITATIONS: We were unable to determine the precise mechanism of the increased
risk of schizophrenia in patients with HCV infection.
CONCLUSION: In a population-based cohort (most aged ≥ 40 years), HCV positivity
was a potential risk factor for the development of schizophrenia; the
HCV-associated risk of schizophrenia might be reversed by interferon-based
antiviral therapy.
