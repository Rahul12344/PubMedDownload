STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created an unprecedented global public
health emergency. The aim of the current study was to report on COVID-19 rates in
an asymptomatic population prior to undergoing spine procedures or surgeries at
two large Los Angeles healthcare systems.
METHODS: Elective spine procedures and surgeries from May 1, 2020 to January 31, 
2021 were included. Results from SARS-CoV-2 virus RT-PCR nasopharyngeal testing
within 72 hours prior to elective spine procedures were recorded. Los Angeles
County COVID-19 rates were calculated using data sets from Los Angeles County
Department of Public Health. Chi-squared test and Stata/IC were used for
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 4,062 spine procedures and surgeries were scheduled during
this time period. Of these, 4,043 procedures and surgeries were performed, with a
total of 19 patients testing positive. Nine positive patients were from UCLA, and
10 from USC. The overall rate of positive tests was low at .47% and reflected
similarities with Los Angeles County COVID-19 rates over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that pre-procedure COVID-19 testing rates
remains very low, and follows similar patterns of community rates. While
pre-procedure testing increases the safety of elective procedures, universal
COVID-19 pre-screening adds an additional barrier to receiving care for patients 
and increases cost of delivering care. A combination of pre-screening,
pre-procedure self-quarantine, and consideration of overall community COVID-19
positivity rates should be further studied.
