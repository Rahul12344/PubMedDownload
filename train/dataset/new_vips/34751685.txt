Advances in the development of modern cancer immunotherapy and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors have dramatically changed the landscape of cancer treatment. However, 
most cancer patients are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors because of
low lymphocytic tumor infiltration and PD-L1 expression. Evidence suggests that
viral oncolysis and immune checkpoint inhibitors have a synergistic effect that
can improve the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, we
developed bioengineered cell membrane nanovesicles (PD1-BCMNs) with programmed
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to harbor oncolytic adenovirus (OA) and achieve a
combination of immune checkpoint blockade and oncolytic virotherapy in one
particle for cancer treatment. PD1-BCMNs could specifically deliver OA to tumor
tissue; the infectivity and replication ability of the OA was preserved in the
presence of neutralizing antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Selective oncolytic
effects with oncolytic adenovirus led to an up-regulated expression of PD-L1 in
the tumor microenvironment, turning immunologically 'cold' tumors into
immunologically 'hot' tumors, presenting more targets for further enhanced target
delivery. Notably, PD1-BCMNs@OA could effectively activate tumor-infiltrating T
cells and elicit a strong anti-tumor immune response. Thus, PD1-BCMNs@OA may
provide a clinical basis for combining oncolytic virotherapy with checkpoint
inhibitors, enhancing the oncolytic adenovirus targeted delivery and
significantly enhancing T cell immune responses, resulting in a stronger
antitumor immunity response.
