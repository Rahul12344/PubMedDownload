Being a major metabolite for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as well as an
important structural component in lipid membrane, cholesterol also plays critical
roles in the life cycles of some viruses, including human immunodeficiency
virus-1 (HIV-1). The involvement of cholesterol in HIV-1 infectivity, assembly
and budding has made it an important research target. Viral protein R (Vpr) is an
accessory protein of HIV-1, which is involved in many major events in the life
cycle of HIV-1. In addition to its multi-functional roles in the HIV-1 life
cycle, it is shown to interact with lipid membrane and form a cation-selective
channel. In this work, we examined the effect of cholesterol on the interaction
of Vpr and lipid membrane. Using calcein release assay, we found that the
membrane permeability induced by the membrane binding of Vpr was significantly
reduced in the presence of cholesterol in membrane. In addition, using
solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy, Vpr was shown to experience multiple
chemical environments in lipid membrane, as indicated by the broad line shape of 
carbonyl 13C resonance of Cys-76 residue ranging from 165-178 ppm, which can be
attributed to the existence of complex Vpr-membrane environments. We further
showed that the presence of cholesterol in membrane will alter the distribution
of Vpr in the complex membrane environments, which may explain the change of the 
Vpr induced membrane permeability in the presence of cholesterol.
