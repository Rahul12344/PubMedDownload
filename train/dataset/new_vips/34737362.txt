The SARS-CoV2 has now spread worldwide causing over four million deaths. Testing 
strategies are highly variable between countries and their impact on mortality is
a major issue. Retrospective multicenter study with a prospective database on all
inpatients throughout mainland France. Using fixed effects models, we exploit
policy discontinuities at region borders in France to estimate the effect of
testing on the case fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined at 
a regional level, generating exogenous variation in testing rates between
departments on each side of a region border. We compared all contiguous
department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The increase
of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.0015 
percentage point in the death rate, that is, for each additional 2000 tests, we
could observe three fewer deaths. Our study suggests that COVID-19 population
testing could have a significant impact on the mortality rate which should be
considered in decision-making. As concern grows over the current second wave of
COVID-19, our findings support the implementation of large-scale screening
strategies in such epidemic contexts.
