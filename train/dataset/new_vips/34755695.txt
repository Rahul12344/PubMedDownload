Concerns over high transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 have led to innovation and
usage of an aerosol box to protect healthcare workers during airway intubation in
patients with COVID-19. However, only a few studies have examined the impact of
these aerosol boxes on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both
thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. In addition, to
our knowledge, only a few studies have included in the concerned testbeds
elements of the work context, which nevertheless have an impact on the use of the
device.
