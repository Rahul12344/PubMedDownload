BACKGROUND: The consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have
already exceeded 10 million infected and more than 560,000 deaths worldwide since
its inception. Currently, it is known that the disease affects mainly the
respiratory system; however, recent studies have shown an increase in the number 
of patients with manifestations in other systems, including gastrointestinal
manifestations. There is a lack of literature regarding the development of acute 
pancreatitis as a complication of coronavirus disease 2019.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of acute pancreatitis in a white male patient with 
coronavirus disease 2019. A 35-year-old man (body mass index 31.5) had acute
epigastric pain radiating to his back, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting for 2 days. 
The patient was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis (AP)-APACHE II: 5, SOFA:
3, Marshall: 0; then he was transferred from ED to the semi-intensive care unit. 
He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and his chest computed tomography
findings were compatible with coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment was based on
bowel rest, fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and empiric antibiotic therapy. At
day 12, with resolution of abdominal pain and improvement of the respiratory
condition, the patient was discharged.
CONCLUSION: Since there is still limited evidence of pancreatic involvement in
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, no definite conclusion
can be made. Given the lack of other etiology, we consider the possibility that
the patient's acute pancreatitis could be secondary to coronavirus disease 2019
infection, and we suggest investigation of pancreas-specific plasma amylase in
patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and abdominal pain.
