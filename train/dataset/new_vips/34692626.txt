Background: To achieve herd immunity, the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by
the population, especially healthcare professionals, plays a key role. The
objective of the present paper is to address the differences in attitudes among
Spanish healthcare professionals compared with the general population regarding
COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This cross-sectional study included data from
2,136 adults (n = 664 healthcare professionals) from an online survey conducted
from May 6 to June 9, 2021. The Vaccination attitudes examination scale was used 
to measure the negative attitudes toward vaccines. Four subscales: mistrust of
vaccine benefit, worries about the unforeseen future effect, concerns about
commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity were calculated.
Generalized linear mixed models were conducted to study these associations.
Results: Between 10.2 and 22.6% of the subjects showed high levels of negative
attitudes toward vaccines. However, only 1.5% of our sample (2.1% among
healthcare professionals) refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it was offered
because they chose otherwise. Retired people showed the lowest concerns and the
highest trust in vaccines. No statistically significant effects were found
between working in a healthcare field and having higher positive attitudes toward
vaccines. Conclusion: Low levels of rejection against the COVID-19 vaccine were
identified in the present sample. However, despite being at a higher risk, health
care professionals did not show higher positive attitudes toward vaccines.
Furthermore, refusal percentage to vaccination was higher among healthcare
professionals compared with non-healthcare professionals. Developing a strategy
to increase positive attitudes against the COVID-19 vaccine should be an
objective for public health policy.
