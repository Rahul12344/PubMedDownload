INTRODUCTION: The etiology of myocarditis often remains undetermined. A large
variety of infectious agents, systemic diseases, drugs, and toxins can cause the 
disease. We report the case of a 19-year-old man who developed myocarditis three 
days after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster vaccination.
CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old man, presenting with troponin-positive acute chest
pain, was referred to our department. He had received the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine three days prior to his admission. The diagnosis of acute
myocarditis was confirmed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Patient
hemodynamic status remained stable during hospitalization. The left ventricular
ejection fraction was preserved during hospital stay and at one-month follow-up. 
We found no evidence for another infectious or autoimmune etiology.
CONCLUSION: Although imputability of the vaccine cannot be formally established
on the basis of this case report, the findings raise the possibility of an
association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and acute myocarditis.
