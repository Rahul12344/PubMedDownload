Varicella (chickenpox) is a common, highly contagious disease caused by primary
infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV), which can result in bacterial
superinfection, central nervous system complications, and hospitalization. Stage 
2 of this Phase 3 open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03843632)
enrolled 100 healthy infants, children, and adolescents (12 months-6 years, n
= 37; 7-12 years, n = 33; 13-17 years, n = 30) without a clinical history of
varicella. Participants aged 12 months-12 years were administered 1 dose of
VARIVAX™ 0.5 mL (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live [Oka/Merck]) and adolescents aged
13-17 years were administered 2 doses 6 weeks apart. For participants
seronegative at baseline (VZV antibody titer <1.25 glycoprotein enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay [gpELISA] units/mL), immunogenicity was assessed by
seroconversion (VZV antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/mL) and VZV antibody
geometric mean titers 6 weeks after the final dose. For participants who were VZV
seropositive at baseline (VZV antibody titer ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL),
immunogenicity was assessed by antibody titer geometric mean fold rise and
percentage of participants with ≥4-fold rise in antibody titer 6 weeks after the 
final dose. A Vaccine Report Card was used to report solicited and unsolicited
adverse events through 42 days post-vaccination. After series completion among
seronegative participants across age groups (n = 74), 98.6% demonstrated
seroconversion 6 weeks post-vaccination; among seropositive participants
(n = 26), 65.4% had ≥4-fold rise in antibody titer 6 weeks post-vaccination. No
new safety signals were observed. Administering VARIVAX to infants, children, and
adolescents resulted in an acceptable immune response with a safety profile
consistent with the licensed product.
