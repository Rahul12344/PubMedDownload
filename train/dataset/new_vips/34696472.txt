It has been hypothesized that the host, viral factors, and secreted cytokines
(especially TNF-α) play roles in the pathogenesis of secondary dengue infections.
Mass spectrometry-based proteomic screening of cytoskeleton fractions isolated
from human endothelial (EA.hy926) cells upon dengue virus (DENV) infection and
TNF-α treatment identified 450 differentially altered proteins. Among them,
decreased levels of moesin, actin stress fiber rearrangements, and dot-like
formations of vinculin were observed with western blot analyses and/or
immunofluorescence staining (IFA). In vitro vascular permeability assays using
EA.hy926 cells, seeded on collagen-coated transwell inserts, showed low levels of
transendothelial electrical resistance in treated cells. The synergistic effects 
of DENV infection and TNF-α treatment caused cellular permeability changes in
EA.hy926 cells, which coincided with decreasing moesin levels and the production 
of abnormal organizations of actin stress fibers and vinculin. Functional studies
demonstrated moesin overexpression restored transendothelial permeability in
DENV/TNF-α-treated EA.hy926 cells. The present study improves the understanding
of the disruption mechanisms of cytoskeleton proteins in enhancing vascular
permeability during DENV infection and TNF-α treatment. The study also suggests
that these disruption mechanisms are major factors contributing to vascular
leakage in severe dengue patients.
