We examined the prospective associations of COVID-19 fears and behavior, and
daily physical activity and dysregulated eating. Adolescents (N = 31) aged 11-17 
completed selected subscales of the Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation and
completed a 7-day health behavior diary. Greater fear of contamination was
associated with lower daily physical activity. In contrast, greater COVID-19
precautionary behavior was associated with greater daily physical activity.
COVID-19 fears and precautionary behaviors have differential associations with
health promoting behavior engagement. Future studies should explore the
mechanisms underlying these links to guide adaptation of health behavior
interventions for this unique cohort.
