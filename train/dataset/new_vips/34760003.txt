The confirmed and suspected cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) have increased in the entire world. There is still no vaccine or
definitive treatment for this virus due to its unknown pathogenesis and
proliferation pathways. Optimized supportive care remains the main therapy, and
the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation.
Enormous demand for handling the COVID-19 outbreak challenged both the
health-care personnel and medical supply system. As outbreaks of COVID-19
develop, prehospital workers, emergency medical services personnel, and other
emergency responders are potentially asked to follow specific practice guidelines
to mitigate the effects of an escalating pandemic. In this article, we have
summarized the current guidance on potential COVID-19 management options. The
recent experience with COVID-19 provided lessons on strategy and policymaking
that the government and ministry of health should be on the alert and concentrate
more on capacity to manage an outbreak like COVID-19. It is important to consider
the new data that emerge daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment
options, and outcomes for COVID-19.
