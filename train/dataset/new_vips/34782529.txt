West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne single-stranded RNA neurotropic virus
within the family Flaviviridae. The virus was first reported in the West Nile
province of Uganda in 1937. Since then, sporadic cases have been reported until
the last two decades when it has emerged as a threat to public health. The
emergence of WNV with more severity in recent times is intriguing. Considering
this phenomenon, the WNV-affected areas of the world were distinguished as old
versus new in a depicted world map. The present review showcases the historical
and epidemiological perspectives of the virus, genetic diversity of prevailing
lineages and clinical spectrum associated with its infection. Emergence of the
virus has been discussed in special context to India because of co-circulation of
different WNV lineages/strains along with other flaviviruses. Recent laboratory
diagnostics, vaccine development and clinical management associated with WNV
infection have also been discussed. Further, the research gaps, especially in
context to India have been highlighted that may have a pivotal role in combating 
the spread of WNV.
