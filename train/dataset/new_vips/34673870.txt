Targeted cancer therapy has aroused the broad interest of researchers due to its 
accuracy in specific tumor targeting and its few side effects on normal cells. In
the last decades, oncolytic viral light particles (L-particles) have been
transformed into smart nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery. However, these
L-particles, similar to the oncolytic viruses that they are derived from, can
only recognize tumor cells expressing corresponding receptors, severely limiting 
their universal application. Although modification of targeting agents onto their
envelope can overcome this limitation, it is still a great challenge to do so
without interfering with their biofunction since the envelope is fragile. Herein,
a host-cell-assisted strategy is proposed to construct folate-engineered
nanocarriers (F-L-particles) with their biofunctions maintained to the largest
extent. The F-L-particles were further multi-functionalized by encapsulating
ultrasmall near-infrared quantum dots and antitumor drugs in them for tumor
real-time imaging and therapy. Such a moderate, efficient and convenient
cell-based strategy facilitates the development and widespread application of
these bio-nanocarriers in the field of targeted cancer therapy, and drives the
interdisciplinary studies of nanotechnology, chemistry, and virology.
