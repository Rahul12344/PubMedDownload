BACKGROUND: Since the focus of healthcare has shifted toward prevention,
pharmacists were highly encouraged to expand their practice to include
immunization services. Our study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and
beliefs of community-based Lebanese pharmacists, in addition to their willingness
to expand their practice scope to include vaccine administration.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the phase preceding the
arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine in Lebanon between 1 and 31st December 2020.
Using a stratified random sampling method, data were collected from Lebanese
community pharmacists (CPs) through an online survey that included information on
socio-demographic characteristics, clinical experience, willingness to administer
vaccines, knowledge about vaccination, attitudes towards immunization, reasons
supporting utilizing pharmacists as immunizers and the requested elements to
incorporate immunization in pharmacists' practice scope. Multivariable analyses
were performed to identify the factors associated with knowledge.
RESULTS: A total of 412 community pharmacists participated in this survey. Of the
total, 66.5% of the surveyed CPs are willing to administer vaccines. The majority
of them (89.8%) had an overall good level. Out of all, 92.7% showed a positive
overall attitude score toward immunization, 95.4% agreed that community
pharmacists can play an important role in advertising and promoting vaccination. 
The main needed elements for implementing immunization services in pharmacies
listed by participants were: support of health authorities (99.3%), statutory
allowance (82.8%), patient demand (95.4%), pharmacist's interest (96.1%) and
continuous education and training workshops on immunization. Older CPs (50 years 
and above) [aOR = 0.703, CI 95% (0.598-0.812)] and those working in Bekaa and
North have lower knowledge score than their counterparts. High educational level 
[aOR = 1.891, CI 95% (1.598-2.019)], previous experience in immunization
[aOR = 3.123, CI 95% (2.652-4.161)] and working in urban areas [aOR = 3.640, CI
95% (2.544-4.717)] were positively associated with a good knowledge level.
CONCLUSION: Most of Lebanese community pharmacists are willing to offer
immunizations. The expansion of the pharmacists practice scope to include
provision of immunizations required a national plan that encompasses
strengthening knowledge, training, certification for eligibility to administer
vaccines, enhancing pharmacovigilance and statutory reform.
