The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic is touching every facet of human lives
(e.g., public health, education, economy, transportation, and the environment).
This novel pandemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions of lockdown and
confinement implemented citywide, regionally or nationally are affecting virus
transmission, people's travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies have been
conducted to predict the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease, assess the impacts of
the pandemic on human mobility and on air quality, and assess the impacts of
lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML)
techniques. This literature review aims to analyze the results from past research
to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures,
human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates
that urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion,
and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19
viral transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use
private transportation for necessary travel to mitigate coronavirus-related
health problems. This review study also noticed that COVID-19 related lockdown
measures significantly improve air quality by reducing the concentration of air
pollutants, which in turn improves the COVID-19 situation by reducing
respiratory-related sickness and deaths. It is argued that ML is a powerful,
effective, and robust analytic paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems
such as a global pandemic. This study also explores the spatio-temporal aspects
of lockdown and confinement measures on coronavirus diffusion, human mobility,
and air quality. Additionally, we discuss policy implications, which will be
helpful for policy makers to take prompt actions to moderate the severity of the 
pandemic and improve urban environments by adopting data-driven analytic methods.
