BACKGROUND: A series of public health preventive measures has been widely
implemented in Beijing to control the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic 
since January 2020. An evaluation of the effects of these preventive measures on 
the spread of other respiratory viruses is necessary.
METHODS: Respiratory specimens collected from children with acute respiratory
infections were tested by NxTAG™ respiratory pathogen panel assays during January
2017 and December 2020. Specimens characterized as rhinoviruses (RVs) were
sequenced to identify the RV species and types. Then, the epidemiology results of
respiratory pathogens in 2020 were compared with those from 2017 to 2019 using
SPSS statistics 22.0.
RESULTS: The positive rates of adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus (flu), RVs, and 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) dropped abruptly by 86.31%, 94.67%, 94.59%, and
92.17%, respectively, from February to May 2020, compared with the average level 
in the same period during 2017-2019. Positive rates of RVs then steeply increased
from June 2020 (13.77%), to an apex (37.25%) in August 2020, significantly higher
than the average rates (22.51%) in August 2017-2019 (P = 0.005). The increase,
especially in group ≥ 3 years, was accompanied by the reopening of schools and
kindergartens after the 23rd and 24th week of 2020 in Beijing.
CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the abrupt drop in viral pathogen positive rates from
February to May 2020 revealed the remarkable effects of the COVID-19 preventive
measures, the sharp increase in positive rates of RVs from the 23rd week of 2020 
might be explained by the reopening of schools and kindergartens in Beijing.
