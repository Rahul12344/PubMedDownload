BACKGROUND: Non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
is a fulminant disease with an increasing incidence. The serum beta-D-glucan
(BDG) assay is used as an adjunct to the diagnosis of PCP; however, the cut-off
value for this assay is not well-defined, especially in the non-HIV PCP
population. Therefore, we aimed to identify the assay cut-off value for this
population.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the medical
records of all patients (≥ 18 years old) with clinical suspicion of PCP who
underwent evaluation of respiratory tract specimens between December 2008 and
June 2014 at Kameda Medical Center. We created a receiver operating
characteristic curve and calculated the area under the curve to determine the
cut-off value for evaluating the inspection accuracy of the BDG assay.
RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were included in the study. Fifty patients
showed positive results in specimen staining, loop-mediated isothermal
amplification assay, and polymerase chain reaction test, while 123 patients
showed negative results. The receiver operating characteristic analyses suggested
that the BDG cut-off level was 8.5 pg/mL, with a sensitivity and specificity of
76% and 76%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Wako-BDG cut-off value for the diagnosis of non-HIV PCP is
8.5 pg/mL, which is lower than the classical cut-off value from previous studies.
Clinicians should potentially consider this lower BDG cut-off value in the
diagnosis and management of patients with non-HIV PCP.
TRIAL REGISTRATION:  The participants were retrospectively registered.
