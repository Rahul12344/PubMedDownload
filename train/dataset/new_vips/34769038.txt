Tetraspanins are transmembrane glycoproteins that have been shown increasing
interest as host factors in infectious diseases. In particular, they were
implicated in the pathogenesis of both non-enveloped (human papillomavirus (HPV))
and enveloped (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika, influenza A virus,
(IAV), and coronavirus) viruses through multiple stages of infection, from the
initial cell membrane attachment to the syncytium formation and viral particle
release. However, the mechanisms by which different tetraspanins mediate their
effects vary. This review aimed to compare and contrast the role of tetraspanins 
in the life cycles of HPV, HIV, Zika, IAV, and coronavirus viruses, which cause
the most significant health and economic burdens to society. In doing so, a
better understanding of the relative contribution of tetraspanins in virus
infection will allow for a more targeted approach in the treatment of these
diseases.
