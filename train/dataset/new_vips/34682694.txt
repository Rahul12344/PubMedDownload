Most humans depend on sunlight exposure to satisfy their requirements for vitamin
D3. However, the destruction of the ozone layer in the past few decades has
increased the risk of skin aging and wrinkling caused by excessive exposure to
ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which may also promote the risk of skin cancer
development. The promotion of public health recommendations to avoid sunlight
exposure would reduce the risk of skin cancer, but it would also enhance the risk
of vitamin D3 insufficiency/deficiency, which may cause disease development and
progression. In addition, the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic may further reduce
sunlight exposure due to stay-at-home policies, resulting in difficulty in active
and healthy aging. In this review article, we performed a literature search in
PubMed and provided an overview of basic and clinical data regarding the impact
of sunlight exposure and vitamin D3 on public health. We also discuss the
potential mechanisms and clinical value of phototherapy with a full-spectrum
light (notably blue, red, and near-infrared light) as an alternative to sunlight 
exposure, which may contribute to combating COVID-19 and promoting active and
healthy aging in current aged/superaged societies.
