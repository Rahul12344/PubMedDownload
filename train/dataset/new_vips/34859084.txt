The lockdown period in Romania lasted for 60 days and had the purpose of limiting
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak and manage its consequences through
emergency measures on many important areas of activity. This study aimed to
gather, assess, analyze and disseminate relevant social, economic, and medical
aspects on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown on the veterinary
profession in Romania. A survey was created using an online questionnaire
platform, and disseminated. The survey was completed by a total of 409
individuals. A high number of respondents (71.64%; n = 293) felt exposed to
medium or high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 at their workplace and many
(56.97%; n = 233) felt that their professional environment was more stressful
than usual during lockdown. Almost all respondents (89.73%; n = 367) declared the
implementation of several control measures recommended by FECAVA and FVE (e.g.,
social distancing, wearing protective equipment, hand washing), but few mentioned
the opportunity of remote work or visiting restrictions. Overall, the results
show that the impact of lockdown lies directly on four main categories of
importance on veterinarian professional's life-human resource, activity
management, relationship between veterinarian and authorities, and continuing
education.
