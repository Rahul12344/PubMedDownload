OBJECTIVES: This study assessed changes in behaviors/attitudes related to the
COVID-19. With the understanding that behaviors and vaccine decision-making could
contribute to global spread of infectious diseases, this study collected several 
waves of internet-based surveys from individuals in the United States, mainland
China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. The aims of this study were to (1)
characterize the relationship between the epidemiology of disease and changes
over time in risk perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes towards hygienic
behaviors; (2) examine if risk perceptions affect acceptance of less-than-ideal
vaccines; and (3) contrast adherence to public health recommendations across
countries which have had different governmental responses to the outbreak.
DATA DESCRIPTION: We conducted cross-sectional online surveys in six countries
from March 2020 to April 2021. By the end of June 2021, there will be six waves
of surveys for the United States and China, and four waves for the rest of
countries. There are common sets of questions for all countries, however, some
questions were adapted to reflect local situations and some questions were
designed intentionally for specific countries to capture different COVID-19
mitigation actions. Participants were asked about their adherence towards
countermeasures, risk perceptions, and acceptance of a hypothetical vaccine for
COVID-19.
