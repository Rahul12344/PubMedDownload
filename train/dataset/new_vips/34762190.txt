In this paper, we analyze some of the policies implemented by Mexico, a country
that has not pursued a total lockdown, although it has implemented different
partial confinement policies. Such approach to the confinement has been
criticized by some authors as morally inappropriate. Our focus is to show that
cultural, political and economic conditions shape the governmental response to
the pandemic. While these can be judged on the basis of their efficiency, it
seems to us that underlying principles are also ethically acceptable.
