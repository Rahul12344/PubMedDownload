Influenza viruses cause a significant number of infections and deaths annually.
In addition to seasonal infections, the risk of an influenza virus pandemic
emerging is extremely high owing to the large reservoir of diverse influenza
viruses found in animals and the co-circulation of many influenza subtypes which 
can reassort into novel strains. Development of a universal influenza vaccine has
proven extremely challenging. In the absence of such a vaccine, rapid response
technologies provide the best potential to counter a novel influenza outbreak.
Here, we demonstrate that a modular trimerization domain known as the molecular
clamp allows the efficient production and purification of conformationally
stabilised prefusion hemagglutinin (HA) from a diverse range of influenza A
subtypes. These clamp-stabilised HA proteins provided robust protection from
homologous virus challenge in mouse and ferret models and some cross protection
against heterologous virus challenge. This work provides a proof-of-concept for
clamp-stabilised HA vaccines as a tool for rapid response vaccine development
against future influenza A virus pandemics.
