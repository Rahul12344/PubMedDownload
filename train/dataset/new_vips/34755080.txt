Impairment in the learning/memory behavior of bees is responsible for the massive
disappearance of bee populations and its consequent agricultural economic losses.
Such impairment might be because of o both pesticide exposure and pathogen
infection, with a key contributor deformed wing virus (DWV). The present study
found that sodium butyrate (NaB) significantly increased survival and reversed
the learning/memory impairment of DWV-infected bees. A next-generation sequencing
analysis showed that NaB affected the expression of genes involved in glycolytic 
processes and memory formation, which were suppressed by DWV infection. In
addition, we performed a large-scale movement tracking experiment by using a
wireless sensor network-based automatic real-time monitoring system and confirmed
that NaB could improve the homing ability of DWV-infected bees. In short, we
demonstrated the mechanism of how epigenetic regulation can resume the memory
function of honeybees and suggest strategies for applying NaB to reduce the
incidence of colony losses.
