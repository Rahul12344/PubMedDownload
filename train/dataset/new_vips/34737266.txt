The origin of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear. Here, we test
whether intra-host virus evolution during persistent infections could be a
contributing factor by characterizing the long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics
in an immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipient. Applying RT-qPCR and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sequential respiratory specimens, we identify
several mutations in the viral genome late in infection. We demonstrate that a
late viral isolate exhibiting genome mutations similar to those found in variants
of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil, can escape
neutralization by COVID-19 antisera. Moreover, infection of susceptible mice with
this patient's escape variant elicits protective immunity against re-infection
with either the parental virus and the escape variant, as well as high
neutralization titers against the alpha and beta SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351, demonstrating a considerable immune control against such variants of
concern. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment, the patient generated
spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection. Our results
suggest that immunocompromised patients could be a source for the emergence of
potentially harmful SARS-CoV-2 variants.
