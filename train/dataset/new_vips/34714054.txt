The development of an extensive toolkit for potential point-of-care diagnostics
that is expeditiously adaptable to new emerging pathogens is of critical public
health importance. Recently, a number of novel CRISPR-based diagnostics have been
developed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we outline the development of an
alternative CRISPR nucleic acid diagnostic utilizing a Cas13d ribonuclease
derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002 (CasRx) to detect SARS-CoV-2, an
approach we term SENSR (sensitive enzymatic nucleic acid sequence reporter) that 
can detect attomolar concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate 100%
sensitivity in patient-derived samples by lateral flow and fluorescence readout
with a detection limit of 45 copy/Î¼L. This technology expands the available
nucleic acid diagnostic toolkit, which can be adapted to combat future pandemics.
