BACKGROUND: We report here a case of a healthy 23-year-old female patient who was
assessed at the gynecology emergency department for genital ulcers, fever, and
blurred vision. After suspicion of herpes simplex virus-2 lesions, the diagnosis 
of Behçet's disease was made. We report this case with the aim of including
Behçet's disease in the differential diagnosis of genital ulcers, and emphasize
the emergency of the vision loss that can be irreversible.
CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 23-year-old European female patient was assessed by 
gynecology in the emergency department for genital lesions associated with fever 
and blurred vision. At first, these lesions were suspected to be primary herpes
simplex virus-2 infection One day later, she experienced decreased visual acuity 
in both eyes. After 4 days of worsening genital ulcers and persistent blurred
vision, the patient was referred to the ophthalmology department. Fundoscopic
examination showed retinal hemorrhages that were consistent with the first
presentation of Behçet's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that genital ulcers can be the very initial
symptom of this ophthalmologic emergency. The differential diagnosis of genital
ulcers is challenging. Behçet's disease should be included, especially when
associated with systemic or ocular manifestations, and should be considered an
emergency for the gynecologist to prevent long-term vision loss.
