OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in sexual, reproductive health and health
status indicators of female sex workers in 12 Brazilian cities.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of biological and behavioral surveillance survey
with a minimum sample of 350 female sex workers per city, recruited by respondent
driven sampling, in 2016. Complex sample design was considered in the data
analysis. Indicators and 95% confidence intervals related to sexual and
reproductive health, and health status were described separately by city and for 
the total sample.
RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 4,328 female sex workers. The coverage of 
Pap smear exam, human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis tests and antenatal
care indicators varied by 20 percentages points or more. Pap smear exam coverage 
ranged from 53.4% in Recife to 73.0% in Porto Alegre. The highest percentage of
female sex workers who had never been tested for human immunodeficiency virus and
syphilis was in Fortaleza (36.8 and 63.8%, respectively). Antenatal coverage
ranged from 61.1% in Salvador to 99.0% in Curitiba. In five cities, the
proportion of female sex workers who disclosed their sex work status in health
services was over 20.0%.
CONCLUSION: The differences between the indicators in the 12 cities followed the 
Brazilian population profile, with more vulnerable sex workers in the North and
Northeast regions. The results show that it is essential to consider the barriers
to accessing health, such as stigma and discrimination, which restrict the
addressing of female sex workers specific needs.
