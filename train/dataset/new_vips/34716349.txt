Low- and middle-income countries are implementing COVID-19 vaccination strategies
in light of varying vaccine efficacies and costs, supply shortages, and resource 
constraints. Here, we use a microsimulation model to evaluate clinical outcomes
and cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccination program in South Africa. We
varied vaccination coverage, pace, acceptance, effectiveness, and cost as well as
epidemic dynamics. Providing vaccines to at least 40% of the population and
prioritizing vaccine rollout prevented >9 million infections and >73,000 deaths
and reduced costs due to fewer hospitalizations. Model results were most
sensitive to assumptions about epidemic growth and prevalence of prior immunity
to SARS-CoV-2, though the vaccination program still provided high value and
decreased both deaths and health care costs across a wide range of assumptions.
Vaccination program implementation factors, including prompt procurement,
distribution, and rollout, are likely more influential than characteristics of
the vaccine itself in maximizing public health benefits and economic efficiency.
