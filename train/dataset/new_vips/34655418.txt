Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) virus uses
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a gateway for their entry into the
human body. The ACE2 with cleaved products have emerged as major contributing
factors to multiple physiological functions and pathogenic complications leading 
to the clinical consequences of the COVID-19 infection Decreased ACE2 expression 
restricts the viral entry into the human cells and reduces the viral load.
COVID-19 infection reduces the ACE2 expression and induces post-COVID-19
complications like pneumonia and lung injury. The modulation of the ACE2-Ang
(1-7)-Mas (AAM) axis is also being explored as a modality to treat post-COVID-19 
complications. Evidence indicates that specific food components may modulate the 
AAM axis. The variations in the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and the
post-COVID its complications are being correlated with varied dietary habits.
Some of the food substances have emerged to have supportive roles in treating
post-COVID-19 complications and are being considered as adjuvants to the COVID-19
therapy. It is possible that some of their active ingredients may emerge as the
direct treatment for the COVID-19.
