Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the
increased mortality risk of patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases and 
COVID-19 was raised. Besides, coronavirus itself enhances the incidence of
myocardial injury, which suggests a two-sided relation. We aimed to discuss the
role of COVID-19 in the progression of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) to
acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which might lead to a greater rate of
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and a higher fatality rate of ACS during the
pandemic. We briefly reviewed several mechanisms in this regard: Systemic
inflammation and cytokine release in critical patients; Plaque rupture and
coronary thrombosis; Dysregulation of cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes; Malignant
ventricular arrhythmias. We reinforce applying more attention to COVID-19
patients with stable CAD during follow-up to prevent progression to ACS. These
individuals should seriously observe World Health Organization protocols to avoid
virus transmission by carriers.
