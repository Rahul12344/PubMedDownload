BACKGROUND: Nigeria has a high burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,
commonly acquired through vertical transmission. However, there is a lack of an
efficient surveillance system for monitoring and understanding the epidemiology
of HBV among pregnant women. Building on a previous review on the prevalence of
HBV in Nigeria (2000-2013), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
HBV prevalence among pregnant women in Nigeria.
METHODS: Four electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and Scopus were
systematically searched from January 2014 to February 2021. We also searched the 
African Journal Online and manually scanned the reference lists of the identified
studies for potentially eligible articles. Observational studies that reported
the prevalence of HBsAg and/or HBeAg among pregnant women in peer-reviewed
journals were included in the study. We performed a meta-analysis using a
random-effects model. We defined HBV infection as a positive test to HBsAg.
RESULTS: From the 158 studies identified, 20 studies with a total sample size of 
26, 548 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of HBV
infection among pregnant women across the studies was 6.49% (95% confidence
interval [CI] = 4.75-8.46%; I2 = 96.7%, p = 0.001; n = 20). The prevalence of HBV
was significantly lower among pregnant women with at least secondary education
compared with those with no education or primary education (prevalence ratio =
0.7, 95% CI = 0.58-0.87; n = 10). However, the prevalence of HBV was not
significantly different by age, religion, marital status, or tribe. The
prevalence of HBV was not significantly different among pregnant women with
previous surgery, blood transfusion, multiple lifetime sex partners, tribal
marks, tattoos, scarification, or sexually transmitted infections, compared with 
those without these risk factors. From a total sample size of 128 (n = 7), the
pooled prevalence of HBeAg among HBV-infected pregnant women was 14.59% (95% CI =
4.58-27.99%; I2 = 65.5%, p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses of HBV infection by study
region and screening method, and meta-regression analysis of the study year,
sample size, and quality rating were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an intermediate endemicity of HBV infection among pregnant 
women in Nigeria. Interventions, such as routine antenatal HBV screening,
antiviral prophylaxis for eligible pregnant women, and infant HBV vaccination
should be scaled up for the prevention of perinatal transmission of HBV infection
in Nigeria.
