Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk for infections due to
chronic immunosuppression. Diarrhea is a commonly encountered problem post
transplantation, with infectious causes of diarrhea being a frequent
complication. Viral infections/enteritides in solid organ transplant recipients
often result from frequently encountered pathogens in this population such as
cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and norovirus. However, several emerging viral
pathogens are increasingly being recognized as more sensitive diagnostic
techniques become available. Treatment is often limited to supportive care and
reduction in immunosuppression, though antiviral therapies mayplay a role in the 
treatment in certain diseases. Viral enteritis is an important entity that
contributes to morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients.
