Purpose: To examine the screening history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia
(VaIN) and vaginal cancer.
Patients and Methods: We included women with histologically confirmed VaIN or
vaginal cancer by colposcopy-directed biopsy between 1 January 2019 and 31
December 2019. The results of cytology, hrHPV, colposcopic examination and
history of hysterectomy were retrospectively analysed.
Results: A total of 26,432 colposcopies were performed during the study period,
among which 2131 women (1835 [86.1%] with VaIN 1; 268 [12.6%] with VaIN 2/3; and 
28 [1.3%] with vaginal cancer) were retrospectively studied. hrHPV test
positivity was significantly higher than that of cytology for VaIN 1 (84.4% vs
67.3%; P < 0.001) and VaIN 2/3 (92.0% vs 79.9%; P < 0.001) but not for vaginal
cancer (84.6% vs 78.6%; P = 0.73). Additionally, the concordance rates for
colposcopic impression were 79.5%, 54.5%, and 92.8% for VaIN1, VaIN2/3, and
vaginal cancer, respectively. All 372 patients had a history of hysterectomy, and
81.0% (282/348) of indications were related to cervical precancer and cancer.
Although cytology test positivity was significantly higher in patients with
hysterectomy than in patients without hysterectomy (76.2% vs 67.5%; P < 0.001),
cytology combined with hrHPV can help to detect more than 95% of VaIN and vaginal
cancer cases in both groups (96.2% for patients with hysterectomy and 96.5% for
patients without hysterectomy).
Conclusion: VaIN and vaginal cancer are not rare diseases. Although cytology was 
sensitive (67.5%-76.2%) for detecting vaginal lesions regardless of hysterectomy,
cytology combined with hrHPV improves detection accuracy up to 95% in both
groups.
