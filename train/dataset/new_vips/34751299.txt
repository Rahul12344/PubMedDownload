BACKGROUND: The coronavirus 2 pandemic (COVID-19) has caused intense changes in
lifestyles, feeding, and nutrition habits.
AIM: To analyze food insecurity and eating habits during the period of quarantine
in a group of Chilean individuals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted in 2,767 households with
questions about the sociodemographic composition of the household, household food
purchasing habits in the quarantine period for COVID-19, and perception of food
insecurity.
RESULTS: More than 60% of households (p < 0.01) were worried about not having
enough food, especially when children under 18 years of age lived in them. This
perception increased in urban households (p < 0.01) and those located in the
Central-Southern and Southern regions (p < 0.01). During the pandemic, the
consumption of healthy products such as milk increased in 50% of households,
legumes in 72%, eggs in 79%, fruits in 54%, vegetables in 67% and water in 81%.
There was also a lower consumption of unhealthy and ultra-processed foods such as
hot-dogs in 90% of households, sausages in 73%, sugary drinks in 79% and ice
cream in 83%.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic in Chile increased the perception of food
insecurity in households with vulnerable conditions. However, the consumption of 
healthier foods increased.
