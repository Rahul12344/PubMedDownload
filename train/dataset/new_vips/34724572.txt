The description of every possible adverse effect or event related to vaccines is 
mandatory during the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 vaccination program. Although
cases of cutaneous varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation after COVID-19
vaccination have been increasingly reported in literature and database sets, a
description of VZV-induced neurological disease (VZV-ND) is still lacking. In the
present study, we retrospectively evaluated patients admitted to our clinic and
diagnosed with VZV-ND during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign (January-April
2021) and in the same months in the previous two years. We identified three
patients with VZV-ND after COVID-19 vaccination and 19 unvaccinated VZV-ND cases 
as controls. In the case-control analysis, the two groups showed no difference in
clinical features, results of diagnostic investigations, and outcome. Thus,
VZV reactivation with neurological involvement might be a possible event
triggered by COVID-19 vaccination, but the benefit following COVID-19 vaccination
overcomes significantly the potential risk associated with a VZV reactivation.
