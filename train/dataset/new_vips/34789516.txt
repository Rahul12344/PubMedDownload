BACKGROUND: Methacholine bronchoprovocation or challenge testing (MCT) is
commonly performed to assess airway hyper-responsiveness in the setting of
suspected asthma. Nebulization is an aerosol-generating procedure, but little is 
known about the risks of MCT in the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to quantify and characterize aerosol
generation during MCT by using different delivery methods and to assess the
impact of adding a viral filter.
METHODS: Seven healthy subjects performed simulated MCT in a near particle-free
laboratory space with 4 different nebulizers and with a dosimeter. Two devices
continuously sampled the ambient air during the procedure, which detected
ultrafine particles, from 0.02-1 μm, and particles of sizes 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,
5.0, and 10 µm, respectively. Particle generation was compared among all the
devices, with and without viral filter placement.
RESULTS: Ultrafine-particle generation during simulated MCT was significant
across all the devices. Ultrafine-particle (0.02-1 μm) concentrations decreased
77%-91% with the addition of a viral filter and varied significantly between
unfiltered (P < .001) and filtered devices (P < .001). Ultrafine-particle
generation was lowest when using the dosimeter with filtered Hudson nebulizer
(1,258 ± 1,644 particle/mL). Ultrafine-particle concentrations with the filtered 
nebulizer devices using a compressor were higher than particle concentrations
detected when using the dosimeter: Monaghan (3,472 ± 1,794 particles/mL), PARI
(4,403 ± 2,948), Hudson (6,320 ± 1,787) and AirLife (9,523 ± 5,098).
CONCLUSIONS: The high particle concentrations generated during MCT pose
significant infection control concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particle
generation during MCT was significantly reduced by using breath-actuated delivery
and a viral filter, which offers an effective mitigation strategy.
