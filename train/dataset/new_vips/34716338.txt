Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early
evidence suggests that the respiratory microbiome may be playing a role in
disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we
examine potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies by
analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory tract microbiome in
well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing,
viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the intensive
care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as associated treatments such as
antibiotic usage, explain the most variation within the upper respiratory tract
microbiome, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically,
mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure and significant
shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell
transcriptomics of the lower respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients identifies
specific oral bacteria in physical association with proinflammatory immune cells,
which show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest
confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome
studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen
support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the
inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.
