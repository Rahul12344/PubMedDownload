Introduction: Coinfections are common in pandemics, however not in recorded
patients with hemoglobinopathies. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic struck Bangladesh at the beginning of March 2020, which is also an apt
period for endemic Dengue fever in this monsoon region.
Case report: We report a 30-year-old man with hemoglobinopathies coinfected with 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Dengue virus.
Dengue virus was detected by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). COVID-19 
was confirmed by Reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and
Hemoglobin Electrophoresis revealed heterozygous beta-thalassemia or thalassemia 
trait. The patient was treated successfully at Dhaka Hospital in icddr,b during
COVID-19 emergency response with symptomatic supportive treatment for COVID-19
and appropriate fluid therapy for dengue fever in response to daily hematocrit
level. The patient's repeated RT-PCR for COVID-19 on day-21 became negative. For 
thalassemia, the patient was advised to have genetic counseling and family
screening on discharge.
Conclusion: The possibility of coinfection between COVID-19 and Dengue fever may 
be considered in a COVID-19 patient with unremitting fever especially in an area 
where Dengue fever is epidemic that may further help to attain appropriate
management of the patient.
