OBJECTIVE: To rank and score 180 countries according to COVID-19 cases and
fatality in 2020 and compare the results to existing pandemic vulnerability
prediction models and results generated by standard epidemiological scoring
techniques.
SETTING: One hundred and eighty countries' patients with COVID-19 and fatality
data representing the healthcare system preparedness and performance in combating
the pandemic in 2020.
DESIGN: Using the retrospective daily COVID-19 data in 2020 broken into 24
half-month periods, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, in
particular, hierarchical clustering analysis to cluster countries into five
groups within each period according to their cumulative COVID-19 fatality per day
over the year and cumulative COVID-19 cases per million population per day over
the half-month period. We used the average of the period scores to assign
countries' final scores for each measure.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcomes are the COVID-19 cases and fatality grades 
in 2020.
RESULTS: The United Arab Emirates and the USA with F in COVID-19 cases, achieved 
A or B in the fatality scores. Belgium and Sweden ranked F in both scores.
Although no African country ranked F for COVID-19 cases, several African
countries such as Gambia and Liberia had F for fatality scores. More developing
countries ranked D and F in fatality than in COVID-19 case rankings. The classic 
epidemiological measures such as averages and rates have a relatively good
correlation with our methodology, but past predictions failed to forecast the
COVID-19 countries' preparedness.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 fatality can be a good proxy for countries' resources and
system's resilience in managing the pandemic. These findings suggest that
countries' economic and sociopolitical factors may behave in a more complex way
as were believed. To explore these complex epidemiological associations, models
can benefit enormously by taking advantage of methods developed in computer
science and machine learning.
