INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe parents' reasoning in making 
decisions about vaccinating their daughters against human papilloma virus (HPV), 
a part of the Swedish vaccination programme.
METHOD: Twenty parents whose daughter had been offered HPV vaccination
participated. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted and analysed
using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The findings reveal that the decision-making process is complex. The
parents trusted the vaccination programme and saw it as beneficial to society.
They also described using different resources to decide about HPV vaccination,
but they did not include their daughters in making the decision.
DISCUSSION: Parents need better vaccine and health literacy to be able to decide,
based on evidence and in consultation with their daughters, on HPV vaccination.
School nurses can play an important role in evidence-based decision-making about 
HPV vaccination and introducing children to this health-promoting intervention.
