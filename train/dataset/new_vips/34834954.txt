Bovine viral diarrhea virus's (BVDV) entry into bovine cells involves attachment 
of virions to cellular receptors, internalization, and pH-dependent fusion with
endosomal membranes. The primary host receptor for BVDV is CD46; however, the
complete set of host factors required for virus entry is unknown. The Madin-Darby
bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line is susceptible to BVDV infection, while a
derivative cell line (CRIB) is resistant at the level of virus entry. We
performed complete genome sequencing of each to identify genomic variation
underlying the resistant phenotype with the aim of identifying host factors
essential for BVDV entry. Three large compound deletions in the BVDV-resistant
CRIB cell line were identified and predicted to disrupt the function or
expression of the genes PTPN12, GRID2, and RABGAP1L. However, CRISPR/Cas9
mediated knockout of these genes, individually or in combination, in the parental
MDBK cell line did not impact virus entry or replication. Therefore, resistance
to BVDV in the CRIB cell line is not due to the apparent spontaneous loss of
PTPN12, GRID2, or RABGAP1L gene function. Identifying the functional cause of
BVDV resistance in the CRIB cell line may require more detailed comparisons of
the genomes and epigenomes.
