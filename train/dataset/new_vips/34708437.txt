COVID-19 is a systemic infectious disease that may affect many organs,
accompanied by a measurable metabolic dysregulation. The disease is also
associated with significant mortality, particularly among the elderly, patients
with comorbidities, and solid organ transplant recipients. Yet, the largest
segment of the patient population is asymptomatic, and most other patients
develop mild to moderate symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we have used 
NMR metabolomics to characterize plasma samples from a cohort of the
abovementioned group of COVID-19 patients (n = 69), between 3 and 10 months after
diagnosis, and compared them with a set of reference samples from individuals
never infected by the virus (n = 71). Our results indicate that half of the
patient population show abnormal metabolism including porphyrin levels and
altered lipoprotein profiles six months after the infection, while the other half
show little molecular record of the disease. Remarkably, most of these patients
are asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients, and we hypothesize that this is due
to a metabolic reflection of the immune response stress.
