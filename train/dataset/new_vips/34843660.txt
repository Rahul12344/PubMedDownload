West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common domestic arbovirus in the United States.
During 2018, WNV was transmitted through solid organ transplantation to 2
recipients who had neuroinvasive disease develop. Because of increased illness
and death in transplant recipients, organ procurement organizations should
consider screening during region-specific WNV transmission months.
