The reactivation of the hepatitis B virus(HBV)induced by chemotherapy can cause
fulminant hepatitis, followed by death. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor
and Welfare released the guideline on the prevention of chemotherapy- induced
reactivation of HBV in 2009. The NCGM's pharmacy department conducted a study on 
the HBV screening rate and the guideline compliance rate in patients undergoing
chemotherapy who met the criteria for monthly HBV DNA monitoring during
chemotherapy and 12 months after. We also conducted a study on the influence on
the guideline compliance rate with inquiries by pharmacists. The HBV screening
rate was 100%(68/68 cases), and there were inquiries in 10.3% (7/68 cases). This 
suggests that inquiries contributed to the improvement in the HBV screening rate.
However, the guideline compliance rate in high-risk cases was 75.0%(12/16 cases).
It is necessary to raise awareness in physicians and patients on the management
of HBV reactivation and to establish a follow-up system for HBV DNA monitoring.
