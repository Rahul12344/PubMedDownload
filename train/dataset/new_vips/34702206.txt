BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to understand how pregnant women
learned about Zika infection and to identify what sources of information were
likely to influence them during their pregnancy.
METHODS: We conducted 13 semi-structed interviews in English and Spanish with
women receiving prenatal care who were tested for Zika virus infection. We
analyzed the qualitative data using descriptive approach.
RESULTS: Pregnant women in the Bronx learned about Zika from family, television, 
the internet and their doctor. Informational sources played different roles.
Television, specifically Spanish language networks, was often the initial source 
of information. Women searched the internet for additional information about
Zika. Later, they engaged in further discussions with their healthcare providers.
CONCLUSIONS: Television played an important role in providing awareness about
Zika to pregnant women in the Bronx, but that information was incomplete. The
internet and healthcare providers were sources of more complete information and
are likely the most influential. Efforts to educate pregnant women about emerging
infectious diseases will benefit from using a variety of approaches including
television messages that promote public awareness followed up by reliable
information via the internet and healthcare providers.
