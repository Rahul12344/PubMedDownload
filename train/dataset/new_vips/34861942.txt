RNA viruses cause many routine illnesses, such as the common cold and the flu.
Recently, more deadly diseases have emerged from this family of viruses. The
hepatitis C virus has had a devastating impact worldwide. Despite the cures
developed in the U.S. and Europe, economically disadvantaged countries remain
afflicted by HCV infection due to the high cost of these medications. More
recently, COVID-19 has swept across the world, killing millions and disrupting
economies and lifestyles; the virus responsible for this pandemic is a
coronavirus. Our understanding of HCV and SARS CoV-2 replication is still in its 
infancy. Helicases play a critical role in the replication, transcription and
translation of viruses. These key enzymes need extensive study not only as an
essential player in the viral lifecycle, but also as targets for antiviral
therapeutics. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge for RNA
helicases of high importance to human health.
