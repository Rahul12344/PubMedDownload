Background and objectives: Although HIV sequence clustering is routinely used to 
identify subpopulations experiencing elevated transmission, it over-simplifies
transmission dynamics and is sensitive to methodology. Complementarily, viral
diversification rates can be used to approximate historical transmission rates.
Here, we investigated the concordance and sensitivity of HIV transmission risk
factors identified by phylogenetic clustering, viral diversification rate,
changes in viral diversification rate and a combined approach.
Methodology: Viral sequences from 9848 people living with HIV in British
Columbia, Canada, sampled between 1996 and February 2019, were used to infer
phylogenetic trees, from which clusters were identified and viral diversification
rates of each tip were calculated. Factors associated with heightened
transmission risk were compared across models of cluster membership, viral
diversification rate, changes in diversification rate, and viral diversification 
rate among clusters.
Results: Viruses within larger clusters had higher diversification rates and
lower changes in diversification rate than those within smaller clusters;
however, rates within individual clusters, independent of size, varied widely.
Risk factors for both cluster membership and elevated viral diversification rate 
included being male, young, a resident of health authority E, previous injection 
drug use, previous hepatitis C virus infection or a high recent viral load. In a 
sensitivity analysis, models based on cluster membership had wider confidence
intervals and lower concordance of significant effects than viral diversification
rate for lower sampling rates.
Conclusions and implications: Viral diversification rate complements phylogenetic
clustering, offering a means of evaluating transmission dynamics to guide
provision of treatment and prevention services.
Lay Summary: Understanding HIV transmission dynamics within clusters can help
prioritize public health resource allocation. We compared socio-demographic and
clinical risk factors associated with phylogenetic cluster membership and viral
diversification rate, a historical branching rate, in order to assess their
relative concordance and sampling sensitivity.
