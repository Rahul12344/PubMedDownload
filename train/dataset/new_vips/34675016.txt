OBJECTIVES: We investigate changes in social contact patterns following the
gradual introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their implications
for infection transmission in the early phase of the pandemic.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an online survey based on targeted
Facebook advertising campaigns across eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, UK and USA), achieving a sample of 51 233
questionnaires in the period 13 March-12 April 2020. Poststratification weights
based on census information were produced to correct for selection bias.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants provided data on social contact numbers, adoption 
of protective behaviours and perceived level of threat. These data were combined 
to derive a weekly index of infection transmission, the net reproduction number
[Formula: see text] .
RESULTS: Evidence from the USA and UK showed that the number of daily contacts
mainly decreased after governments issued the first physical distancing
guidelines. In mid-April, daily social contact numbers had decreased between 61% 
in Germany and 87% in Italy with respect to pre-COVID-19 levels, mostly due to a 
contraction in contacts outside the home. Such reductions, which were uniform
across age groups, were compatible with an [Formula: see text] equal or smaller
than one in all countries, except Germany. This indicates lower levels of
infection transmission, especially in a period of gradual increase in the
adoption rate of the face mask outside the home.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided a comparable set of statistics on social contact
patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic for eight high-income countries,
disaggregated by week and other demographic factors, which could be leveraged by 
the scientific community for developing more realistic epidemic models of
COVID-19.
