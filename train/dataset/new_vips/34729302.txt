Various boron-containing drugs have been approved for clinical use over the past 
two decades, and more are currently in clinical trials. The increasing interest
in boron-containing compounds is due to their unique binding properties to
biological targets; for example, boron substitution can be used to modulate
biological activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and drug resistance. In this
perspective, we aim to comprehensively review the current status of boron
compounds in drug discovery, focusing especially on progress from 2015 to
December 2020. We classify these compounds into groups showing anticancer,
antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and other activities, and discuss the
biological targets associated with each activity, as well as potential future
developments.
