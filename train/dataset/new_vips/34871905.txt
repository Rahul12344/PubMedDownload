The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, but
effective antiviral therapies are not widely available. To improve treatment
options, we conducted a high-throughput screen to uncover compounds that block
SARS-CoV-2 infection. A minimally pathogenic human betacoronavirus (OC43) was
used to infect physiologically-relevant human pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC5) to
facilitate rapid antiviral discovery in a preclinical model. Comprehensive
profiling was conducted on more than 600 compounds, with each compound arrayed
across 10 dose points. Our screening revealed several FDA-approved agents that
can attenuate both OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, including lapatinib,
doramapimod, and 17-AAG. Importantly, lapatinib inhibited SARS-CoV-2 RNA
replication by over 50,000-fold. Further, both lapatinib and doramapimod could be
combined with remdesivir to improve antiviral activity in cells. These findings
reveal novel therapeutic avenues that could limit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
