Metallocarboxypeptidases play critical roles in the development of mosquitoes and
influence pathogen/parasite infection of the mosquito midgut. Here, we report the
crystal structure of Aedes aegypti procarboxypeptidase B1 (PCPBAe1),
characterized its substrate specificity and mechanism of binding to and
inhibiting Dengue virus (DENV). We show that the activated PCPBAe1 (CPBAe1)
hydrolyzes both Arg- and Lys-substrates, which is modulated by residues Asp251
and Ser239 Notably, these residues are conserved in CPBs across mosquito species,
possibly required for efficient digestion of basic dietary residues that are
necessary for mosquito reproduction and development. Importantly, we
characterized the interaction between PCPBAe1 and DENV envelope (E) protein,
virus-like particles, and infectious virions. We identified residues Asp18A,
Glu19A, Glu85, Arg87, and Arg89 of PCPBAe1 are essential for interaction with
DENV. PCPBAe1 maps to the dimeric interface of the E protein domains I/II
(Lys64-Glu84, Val238-Val252, and Leu278-Leu287). Overall, our studies provide
general insights into how the substrate-binding property of mosquito
carboxypeptidases could be targeted to potentially control mosquito populations
or proposes a mechanism by which PCPBAe1 binds to and inhibits DENV.
