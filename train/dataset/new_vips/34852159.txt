This study aimed to compare the anthropometric measurements and body
proportionalities of neonates born before the Zika virus epidemic with those born
during this period. We compared 958 neonates born during the pre-Zika epidemic
with 264 neonates born during the epidemic period. The newborns had their head
circumference, weight, and length classified according to the Fenton & Kim growth
chart. We considered disproportionate those individuals that presented
microcephaly and adequate weight or length for sex and gestational age, and those
whose head circumferences were lower than the ratio ((length / 2) + 9.5) - 2.5cm.
We estimated the frequencies of Zika positivity and brain imaging findings among 
neonates with microcephaly born during the epidemic period, concerning the
anthropometric and body proportionality parameters. Low weight and proportionate 
microcephaly were similar among newborns from both periods. However, the
frequencies of newborns with microcephaly with a very low length and
disproportionate microcephaly were higher among the neonates of the epidemic
period with brain abnormalities and positive for Zika virus. We conclude that, at
birth, the disproportion between head circumference and length can be an
indicator of the severity of microcephaly caused by congenital Zika.
