Since the COVID-19 pandemic initiation, the possibility of re-infection has been 
unclearly present. Although herd immunity has a potential reliance through
natural infection, human corona viruses has the ability to subvert immunity and
re-infection happens for seasonal corona viruses. Currently, the frequency of
SARS-CoV-2 re-infection incidence is not exactly defined. In this study we aimed 
at determination of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection rate in Iranian population. In a
total of 5696 COVID-19 suspicious individuals, RT-PCR was applied to diagnose the
infection. The confirmed patients were followed for 12 months and serology tests 
were applied to measure the specific antibodies. Among 1492 confirmed COVID-19
cases, five individuals experienced the subsequent infection. The
re-infection/reactivation incidence rate was totally 0.33% after one year of
follow-up. The interval ranged from 63 to 156 days. All the cases had viral
mutations in the second episode of the infection. All of them were symptomatic
cases with moderate severity. The estimated rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Persian
population is therefore rare and natural infection seems to induce good
protection against re-infection which clarifies that mass vaccination can hugely 
affect the society.
