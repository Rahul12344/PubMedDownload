The purpose of this special issue of the Journal of Emergency Management is to
assess the state of disaster preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery
during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article adds to this discussion by examining
the results of a national survey of emergency managers in the United States
regarding the social media platforms they use to communicate information related 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, how proficient they feel using them, and what value
they see in these technologies during the times of crisis. The authors' findings 
help make sense of government responses to the pandemic, as well as contribute to
the body of literature on communication and emergency management more broadly.
Furthermore, their findings have important implications for emergency management 
practitioners and educators.
