A two-dose regimen of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) Covid-19 vaccine with an
inter-dose interval of three months has been implemented in many countries with
restricted vaccine supply. However, there is limited evidence for the
effectiveness of ChAdOx1 by dose in elderly populations in countries with high
prevalence of the Gamma variant of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we estimate ChAdOx1
effectiveness by dose against the primary endpoint of RT-PCR-confirmed Covid-19, 
and secondary endpoints of Covid-19 hospitalization and Covid-19-related death,
in adults aged ≥60 years during an epidemic with high Gamma variant prevalence in
São Paulo state, Brazil using a matched, test-negative case-control study.
Starting 28 days after the first dose, effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 
is 33.4% (95% CI, 26.4-39.7) against Covid-19, 55.1% (95% CI, 46.6-62.2) against 
hospitalization, and 61.8% (95% CI, 48.9-71.4) against death. Starting 14 days
after the second dose, effectiveness of the two-dose schedule is 77.9% (95% CI,
69.2-84.2) against Covid-19, 87.6% (95% CI, 78.2-92.9) against hospitalization,
and 93.6% (95% CI, 81.9-97.7) against death. Completion of the ChAdOx1 vaccine
schedule affords significantly increased protection over a single dose against
mild and severe Covid-19 outcomes in elderly individuals during widespread Gamma 
variant circulation.
