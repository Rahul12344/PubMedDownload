Education and health are two inseparable aspects of a single dynamic which aims
to support and increase the physical and mental well-being of children and young 
people. Children must be guaranteed two rights: the right to study and the right 
to health. Schools capable of reconciling these two fundamental needs are
represented by school in hospital and home schooling. Thanks to this flexible
teaching method, it is possible to support the child and his or her family during
hospitalization, and to prevent consequences such as school failure and dropout. 
Hospitalization is always a traumatic event for children, in which white coats
are unknown figures, perceived all the more threatening the younger the child: a 
threat to one's integrity, loss of autonomy, distorted perception of time, loss
of confidence, and a sense of abandonment. Therefore, it is important to create a
communicative basis that facilitates the child's adaptation to the new hospital
environment and establishes continuity during this period of time. Teachers play 
a significant role within the context of such difficulties. They need to
understand patients' emotions and act as a bridge between the small inpatient
room of the child and the outside world. In this article we examined: (1) the
School in Hospital and the reasons why it is a valid resource for the
psychophysical rehabilitation of the student in a hospital; (2) the role of the
teacher in hospital and the difficult context in which the teacher has to work;
and (3) how the school in hospital was challenged by the SARS-CoV2 pandemic.
