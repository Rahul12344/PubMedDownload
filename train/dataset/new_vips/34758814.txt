BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic heightened, infection control and prevention
experts recommended clinical training opportunities be modified or discontinued, 
substantially impacting the function of clinical or medical teaching units (CTU).
A CTU is structured to involve medical learners such that they become active
participants of the health care team. Since a review of the literature
demonstrates a paucity of data to guide pediatric CTU implementation during
pandemic phases, we developed and disseminated a survey to assess Canadian
practices.
METHOD: A group of infectious disease specialists and pediatric hospitalists
developed, tested, and disseminated surveys to understand CTU clinical rounding
and teaching practices during the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULT: Our surveys demonstrate the variability in adapting rounding practices
during this pandemic and highlights the opportunities to share our approaches and
lessons learned to optimize learner experience and patient centered care during
unprecedented times in our academic hospitals. We also show the pragmatic
implementation of our new pediatric hospital CTU process that was informed by our
survey results.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the variability in adapting rounding practices
during this pandemic and highlights the opportunities to share our approaches and
lessons learned to optimize learner experience and patient centered care during
unprecedented times in our academic hospitals.
