Human parechovirus (PeV-A), one of the species within the Picornaviridae family, 
is known to cause disease in humans. The most commonly detected genotypes are
PeV-A1, associated with mild gastrointestinal disease in young children, and
PeV-A3, linked to severe disease with neurological symptoms in neonates. As PeV-A
are detectable in stool and nasopharyngeal samples, entry is speculated to occur 
via the respiratory and gastro-intestinal routes. In this study, we characterized
PeV-A1 and PeV-A3 replication and tropism in the intestinal epithelium using a
primary 2D model based on human fetal enteroids. This model was permissive to
infection with lab-adapted strains and clinical isolates of PeV-A1, but for
PeV-A3, infection could only be established with clinical isolates. Replication
was highest with infection established from the basolateral side with apical
shedding for both genotypes. Compared to PeV-A1, replication kinetics of PeV-A3
were slower. Interestingly, there was a difference in cell tropism with PeV-A1
infecting both Paneth cells and enterocytes, while PeV-A3 infected mainly goblet 
cells. This difference in cell tropism may explain the difference in replication 
kinetics and associated disease in humans.
