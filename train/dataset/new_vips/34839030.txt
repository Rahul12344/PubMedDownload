We provide an overview of the currently known diversity of viral sequences
integrated into insect genomes. Such endogenous viral elements (EVE) have so far 
been annotated in at least eight insect orders and can be assigned to at least
three families of large double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses, at least 22 families of
RNA viruses, and three families of single-stranded DNA viruses. The study of
these EVE has already produced important insights into insect-virus interactions,
including the discovery of a new form of adaptive antiviral immunity. Insect EVE 
diversity will continue to increase as new insect genomes and exogenous viruses
are sequenced, which will continue to make paleovirology a vibrant research field
in this group of animals in the years to come.
