BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
overlap with those of other disorders, especially cardiovascular disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: We herein describe a 58-year-old woman who presented with
syncopal episodes and dyspnea on exertion with a left atrial (LA) mass, scheduled
for surgical removal and mitral valve replacement. Nearly 3 months later, the
patient developed dyspnea, fever, and a sore throat, resulting in hospital
admission with suspected COVID-19. During the diagnostic evaluation, a larger LA 
mass was detected. The mass seemed to be a COVID-19-induced organized thrombus
with prosthetic mitral valve malfunction. Resection was, therefore, planned. An
immunohistochemistry study revealed a liposarcoma.
CONCLUSIONS: The unusual early recurrence of liposarcomas and the misdiagnosis
with COVID-19-induced thrombosis are the hallmark of the present case.
