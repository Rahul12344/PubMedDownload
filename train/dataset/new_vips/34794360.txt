Selected lymphoid and reproductive tissues were examined from groups of
3-week-old chickens and 62-week-old hens that were inoculated choanally and
conjunctivally with 106 EID50 of a virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolate
from the California 2018-2020 outbreak, and euthanized at 1, 2, and 3 days
postinfection. In the 3-week-old chickens, immunohistochemistry for NDV and for T
and B cell lymphocytes, as well as in situ hybridization for IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, 
and TNF-α revealed extensive expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in lymphoid tissues,
often coinciding with NDV antigen. IFN-γ was only expressed infrequently in the
same lymphoid tissues, and TNF-α was rarely expressed. T-cell populations
initially expanded but by day 3 their numbers were below control levels. B cells 
underwent a similar expansion but remained elevated in some tissues, notably
spleen, cecal tonsils, and cloacal bursa. Cytokine expression in the 62-week-old 
hens was overall lower than in the 3-week-old birds, and there was more prolonged
infiltration of both T and B cells in the older birds. The strong
pro-inflammatory cytokine response in young chickens is proposed as the reason
for more severe disease.
