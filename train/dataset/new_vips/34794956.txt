BACKGROUND: With reports of surges in COVID-19 case numbers across over 50
countries, country-level epidemiological analysis is required to inform
context-appropriate response strategies for containment and mitigation of the
outbreak. We aimed to compare the epidemiological features of the first and
second waves of COVID-19 in Nigeria.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Surveillance Outbreak
Response Management and Analysis System data of the first and second
epidemiological waves, which were between 27 February and 24 October 2020, and 25
October 2020 to 3 April 2021, respectively. Descriptive statistical measures
including frequencies and percentages, test positivity rate (TPR), cumulative
incidence (CI) and case fatality rates (CFRs) were compared. A p value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried
out in STATA V.13.
RESULTS: There were 802 143 tests recorded during the study period (362 550 and
439 593 in the first and second waves, respectively). Of these, 66 121 (18.2%)
and 91 644 (20.8%) tested positive in the first and second waves, respectively.
There was a 21.3% increase in the number of tests conducted in the second wave
with TPR increasing by 14.3%. CI during the first and second waves were 30.3/100 
000 and 42.0/100 000 respectively. During the second wave, confirmed COVID-19
cases increased among females and people 30 years old or younger and decreased
among urban residents and individuals with travel history within 14 days of
sample collection (p value <0.001). Most confirmed cases were asymptomatic at
diagnosis during both waves: 74.9% in the first wave; 79.7% in the second wave.
CFR decreased during the second wave (0.7%) compared with the first wave (1.8%).
CONCLUSION: Nigeria experienced a larger but less severe second wave of COVID-19.
Continued implementation of public health and social measures is needed to
mitigate the resurgence of another wave.
