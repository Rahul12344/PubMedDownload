BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic as a global mental health crisis has affected
everyone, including students. The present study aimed to determine and
investigate the relationship between health locus of control and perceived stress
in students of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences (southern Iran) during the 
outbreak of COVID-19.
METHODS: The present cross-sectional study examined 250 students of Bushehr
University of Medical Sciences. We performed simple random sampling and utilized 
the demographic information form, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale 
(MHLCS) by Wallston, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by Cohen to collect data.
We analyzed data using the SPSS, Pearson correlation coefficient, and the
hierarchical regression model with an error level of 5%.
RESULTS: The mean perceived stress was 30.74 ± 8.09, and 92.4% of the students
had moderate and high stress levels. Among the components of the health locus of 
control, the internal health locus of control (IHLC) had the highest mean in
students (27.55 ± 3.81). Furthermore, the internal health locus of control
(R = - 0.30, P < 0.001) had a significant inverse relationship, with perceived
stress and the chance health locus of control (CHLC) (R = 0.30, P < 0.001) had a 
significant direct relationship. In the final regression model, the health locus 
of control and all the variables predicted 22.7% of the perceived stress
variation in students during the COVID-19 period.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the internal health locus of control was
associated with a reduction of perceived stress, and the powerful others health
locus of control (PHLC) was related to its increase in students during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Given the uncertain future, in the present work, universities 
are suggested to design web-based educational interventions alongside the
curriculum to further strengthen the internal health locus of control and thus
help reduce their perceived stress.
