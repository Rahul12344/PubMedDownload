Most individuals seroconvert after infection with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but being seronegative is observed in 1 to
9%. We aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with being seronegative
following PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a prospective cohort study, we
screened health care workers (HCW) in the Capital Region of Denmark for
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We performed three rounds of screening from April to
October 2020 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method targeting 
SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Data on all participants' PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
were captured from national registries. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox
proportional hazards models were applied to investigate the probability of being 
seronegative and the related risk factors, respectively. Of 36,583 HCW, 866
(2.4%) had a positive PCR before or during the study period. The median
(interquartile range [IQR]) age of 866 HCW was 42 (31 to 53) years, and 666 (77%)
were female. After a median of 132 (range, 35 to 180) days, 21 (2.4%) of 866 were
seronegative. In a multivariable model, independent risk factors for being
seronegative were self-reported asymptomatic or mild infection hazard ratio (HR) 
of 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 17; P < 0.001) and body mass index
(BMI) of ≥30, HR 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1 to 8.8; P = 0.039). Only a few (2.4%) HCW were 
not seropositive. Asymptomatic or mild infection as well as a BMI above 30 were
associated with being seronegative. Since the presence of antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 reduces the risk of reinfection, efforts to protect HCW with risk
factors for being seronegative may be needed in future COVID-19 surges.
IMPORTANCE Most individuals seroconvert after infection with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but negative serology is
observed in 1 to 9%. We found that asymptomatic or mild infection as well as a
BMI above 30 were associated with being seronegative. Since the presence of
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 reduces the risk of reinfection, efforts to protect
HCW with risk factors for being seronegative may be needed in future COVID-19
surges.
