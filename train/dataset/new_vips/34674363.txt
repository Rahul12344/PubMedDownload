SARS-CoV-2 infection can present either an asymptomatic or symptomatic; the
spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical. A majority of
patients have experienced mild symptoms with a good prognosis. But approximately 
14% of them have severe infection presenting with hypoxemia and extensive lung
involvement. The current mini-review describes the dysregulation of immune
response for SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia and virus-induced lung injury. Also, many
confounding factors can increase lung injury, in addition to virus-induced lung
injury. Especially in critically ill patients, confounding factors can cause the 
inflammatory cascade, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mortality.
