The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to public health
world-wide. To make decisions about mitigation strategies and to understand the
disease dynamics, policy makers and epidemiologists must know how the disease is 
spreading in their communities. Here we analyse confirmed infections and deaths
over multiple geographic scales to show that COVID-19's impact is highly unequal:
many regions have nearly zero infections, while others are hot spots. We
attribute the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which the disease arrives
to regions at different times and grows exponentially at different rates. Faster 
growing regions correspond to hot spots that dominate spatially aggregated
statistics, thereby skewing growth rates at larger spatial scales. Finally, we
use these analyses to show that, across multiple spatial scales, the growth rate 
of COVID-19 has slowed down with each surge. These results demonstrate a
trade-off when estimating growth rates: while spatial aggregation lowers noise,
it can increase bias. Public policy and epidemic modelling should be aware of,
and aim to address, this distortion. This article is part of the theme issue
'Data science approaches to infectious disease surveillance'.
