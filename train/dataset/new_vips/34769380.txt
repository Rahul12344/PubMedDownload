Despite the well-accepted role of the two main neuropathological markers
(β-amyloid and tau) in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the interaction
and specific contribution of each of them is not fully elucidated. To address
this question, in the present study, an adeno-associated virus (AAV9) carrying
the mutant P301L form of human tau, was injected into the dorsal hippocampi of
APP/PS1 transgenic mice or wild type mice (WT). Three months after injections,
memory tasks, biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. We
found that the overexpression of hTauP301L accelerates memory deficits in APP/PS1
mice, but it did not affect memory function of WT mice. Likewise, biochemical
assays showed that only in the case of APP/PS1-hTauP301L injected mice, an
important accumulation of tau was observed in the insoluble urea fraction.
Similarly, electron microscopy images revealed that numerous clusters of tau
immunoparticles appear at the dendrites of APP/PS1 injected mice and not in WT
animals, suggesting that the presence of amyloid is necessary to induce tau
aggregation. Interestingly, these tau immunoparticles accumulate in dendritic
mitochondria in the APP/PS1 mice, whereas most of mitochondria in WT injected
mice remain free of tau immunoparticles. Taken together, it seems that amyloid
induces tau aggregation and accumulation in the dendritic mitochondria and
subsequently may alter synapse function, thus, contributing to accelerate
cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice.
