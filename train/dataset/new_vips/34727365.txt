Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus, which was
first identified in December 2019 in China, has resulted in a yet ongoing viral
pandemic. Coronaviridae could potentially cause several disorders in a wide range
of hosts such as birds and mammals. Although infections caused by this family of 
viruses are predominantly limited to the respiratory tract, Betacoronaviruses are
potentially able to invade the central nervous system (CNS) as well as many other
organs, thereby inducing neurological damage ranging from mild to lethal in both 
animals and humans. Over the past two decades, three novel CoVs, SARS-CoV-1,
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, emerging from animal reservoirs have exhibited
neurotropic properties causing severe and even fatal neurological diseases. The
pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses has yet to be fully known. Both
clinical features of the previous CoV epidemics (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) and
lessons from animal models used in studying neurotropic CoVs, especially SARS and
MERS, constitute beneficial tools in comprehending the exact mechanisms of virus 
implantation and in illustrating pathogenesis and virus dissemination pathways in
the CNS. Here, we review the animal research which assessed CNS infections with
previous more studied neurotropic CoVs to demonstrate how experimental studies
with appliable animal models can provide scientists with a roadmap in the CNS
impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, animal studies can finally help us discover the
underlying mechanisms of damage to the nervous system in COVID-19 patients and
find novel therapeutic agents in order to reduce mortality and morbidity
associated with neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
