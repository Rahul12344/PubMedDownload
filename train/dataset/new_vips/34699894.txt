Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) nanoparticles are often used in mucosal
immunity, preparation of subunit vaccines or as an immune adjuvant due to its
good immunological activities in recent years. Here, we designed and screened out
a high affinity peptide ligand PL23, which could specifically target the
non-epitope region of Classic Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) E2 protein, by virtual
screening technology, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) test. The OD value of PL23 at 450 nm was reached 1.982,
and the KD value of it was 90.12 nM. Its binding capacity to protein was verified
by SDS-PAGE as well. PL23 was subsequently conjugated to GEM nanoparticles by
dehydration synthesis generating GEM-PL23 particles, and the GEM-PL-E2 particles 
were assembled after incubated with CSFV E2 protein. The cytotoxic test indicated
that PL23, CSFV E2 protein, GEM nanoparticles, GEM-PL23 particles and GEM-PL-E2
particles were not toxic to cells and GEM nanoparticles could significantly
promote the growth of APCs at high concentration for 1 h, p<0.001. In addition,
GEM nanoparticles could promote the uptake of antigen by APCs. The cytokines
tests suggested that GEM-PL-E2 particles could promote innate immune responses,
regulate adaptive immune responses generated by T cells and APCs, and promote the
differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells without producing
inflammasomes. The results of immunological activity identification showed
GEM-PL-E2 particles induced higher levels of both neutralizing antibodies and
anti-CSFV antibodies than CSFV E2 protein in mice. This strategy provided a new, 
simpler, faster and cheaper method for assembling GEM nanoparticles, using an
affinity peptide ligand replaced the protein anchor (PA), and provided a better
application prospect for the application of GEM particles.
