Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry to
the host cell. Indeed, the first step in viral entry is the binding of the viral 
trimeric spike (S) protein to ACE2. Abundantly present in human epithelial cells 
of many organs, ACE2 is also expressed in the human brain. ACE2 is a type I
membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain and a
C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single transmembrane helix and
an intracellular 44-residue segment. This C-terminal segment contains a
PDZ-binding motif (PBM) targeting protein-interacting domains called
PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ). Here, we identified the human PDZ specificity profile of
the ACE2 PBM using the high-throughput holdup assay and measuring the binding
intensities of the PBM of ACE2 against the full human PDZome. We discovered 14
human PDZ binders of ACE2 showing significant binding with dissociation
constants' values ranging from 3 to 81 μM. NHERF, SHANK, and SNX27 proteins found
in this study are involved in protein trafficking. The PDZ/PBM interactions with 
ACE2 could play a role in ACE2 internalization and recycling that could be of
benefit for the virus entry. Interestingly, most of the ACE2 partners we
identified are expressed in neuronal cells, such as SHANK and MAST families, and 
modifications of the interactions between ACE2 and these neuronal proteins may be
involved in the neurological symptoms of COVID-19.
