CRISPR/Cas is a powerful tool for studying the role of genes in viral infections.
The invention of CRISPR screening technologies has made it possible to untangle
complex interactions between the host and viral agents. Moreover, whole-genome
and pathway-specific CRISPR screens have facilitated identification of novel drug
candidates for treating viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent
developments in the fields of CRISPR/Cas with a focus on the use of CRISPR
screens for studying viral infections and identifying new candidate genes to aid 
development of antivirals.
