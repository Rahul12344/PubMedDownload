COVID-19 respiratory failure is a life-threatening condition. Oxygenation targets
were evaluated in a non-ICU setting. In this retrospective, observational study, 
we enrolled all patients admitted to the University Hospital of Genoa, Italy,
between 1 February and 31 May 2020 with an RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. PaO2, 
PaO2/FiO2 and SatO2% were collected and analyzed at time 0 and in case of
admission, patients who required or not C-PAP (groups A and B) were categorized. 
Each measurement was correlated to adverse outcome. A total of 483 patients were 
enrolled, and 369 were admitted to hospital. Of these, 153 required C-PAP and 266
had an adverse outcome. Patients with PaO2 <60 and >100 had a higher rate of
adverse outcome at time 0, in groups A and B (OR 2.52, 3.45, 2.01, respectively).
About the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the OR for < 300 was 3.10 at time 0, 4.01 in group A
and 4.79 in group B. Similar odds were found for < 200 in any groups and < 100
except for group B (OR 11.57). SatO2 < 94% showed OR 1.34, 3.52 and 19.12 at time
0, in groups A and B, respectively. PaO2 < 60 and >100, SatO2 < 94% and PaO2/FiO2
ratio < 300 showed at least two- to three-fold correlation to adverse outcome.
This may provide simple but clear targets for clinicians facing COVID-19
respiratory failure in a non ICU-setting.
