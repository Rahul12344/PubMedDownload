We prospectively surveyed SARS-CoV-2 RNA contamination in staff common areas
within an acute-care hospital. An increasing prevalence of surface contamination 
was detected over time. Adjusting for patient census or community incidence of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the proportion of contaminated surfaces did 
not predict healthcare worker COVID-19 infection on study units.
