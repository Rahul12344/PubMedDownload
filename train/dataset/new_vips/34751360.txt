In this article, we examine what the role of the private sector in times of
crises is and whether the private sector is, and can be held to be, accountable. 
COVID-19 has amplified the difficulties with public-private partnerships and this
article addresses several aspects concerning business enterprises, in particular 
transnational corporations, human rights and health sector activities,
highlighting the key aspects to understand and address accountability issues. The
article also explores accountability for the private sector, the processes to
ensure accountability, and the relevance of regulation and self-regulation.
