Engineered T cell therapies have revolutionized modern oncology, however
processes for manufacturing T cell therapies vary and the impact of manufacturing
processes On the cell product is poorly understood. Herein, we have used a
commercially available hollow fiber membrane bioreactor (HFMBR) operated in a
novel mode to demonstrate that T cells can be engineered with lentiviruses, grown
to very high densities, and washed and harvested in a single, small volume
bioreactor that is readily amenable to automation. Manufacturing within the HFMBR
dramatically changed the programming of the T cells and yielded a product with
greater therapeutic potency than T cells produced using the standard manual
method. This change in programming was associated with increased resistance to
cryopreservation, which is beneficial as T cell products are typically
cryopreserved prior to administration to the patient. Transcriptional profiling
of the T cells revealed a shift toward a glycolytic metabolism, which may protect
cells from oxidative stress offering an explanation for the improved resistance
to cryopreservation. This study reveals that the choice of bioreactor
fundamentally impacts the engineered T cell product and must be carefully
considered. Furthermore, these data challenge the premise that glycolytic
metabolism is detrimental to T cell therapies.
