Online health misinformation is a growing problem, and health information
professionals and consumers would benefit from an evaluation of health websites
for reliability and trustworthiness. Terms from the Google COVID-19 Search Trends
dataset were searched on Google to determine the most frequently appearing
consumer health information websites. The quality of the resulting top five
websites was evaluated. The top five websites that appeared most frequently were 
WebMD, Mayo Clinic, Healthline, MedlinePlus, and Medical News Today,
respectively. All websites, except Medline Plus, received HONcode certification. 
Based on DISCERN and CRAAP scores, MedlinePlus was found to be the most reliable 
health website.
