Background: COVID-19 is characterized by strikingly large, mostly unexplained,
interindividual variation in symptom severity: while some individuals remain
nearly asymptomatic, others suffer from severe respiratory failure. Previous
vaccinations for other pathogens, in particular tetanus, may partly explain this 
variation, possibly by readying the immune system.
Methods: We made use of data on COVID-19 testing from 103,049 participants of the
UK Biobank (mean age 71.5 years, 54.2% female), coupled to immunization records
of the last ten years. Using logistic regression, covarying for age, sex,
respiratory disease diagnosis, and socioeconomic status, we tested whether
individuals vaccinated for tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis, differed from
individuals that had only received other vaccinations on 1) undergoing a COVID-19
test, 2) being diagnosed with COVID-19, and 3) whether they developed severe
COVID-19 symptoms.
Results: We found that individuals with registered diphtheria or tetanus
vaccinations are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than people who had only 
received other vaccinations (diphtheria odds ratio (OR)=0.47, p-value=5.3*10-5;
tetanus OR=0.52, p-value=1.2*10-4).
Discussion: These results indicate that a history of diphtheria or tetanus
vaccinations is associated with less severe manifestations of COVID-19. These
vaccinations may protect against severe COVID-19 symptoms by stimulating the
immune system. We note the correlational nature of these results, yet the
possibility that these vaccinations may influence the severity of COVID-19
warrants follow-up investigations.
