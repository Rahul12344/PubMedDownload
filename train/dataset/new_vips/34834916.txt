Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on a host cell for replication and
survival. Consequently, to fully understand the viral processes involved in
infection and replication, it is fundamental to study them in the cellular
context. Often, viral infections induce significant changes in the subcellular
organization of the host cell due to the formation of viral factories, alteration
of cell cytoskeleton and/or budding of newly formed particles. Accurate 3D
mapping of organelle reorganization in infected cells can thus provide valuable
information for both basic virus research and antiviral drug development. Among
the available techniques for 3D cell imaging, cryo-soft X-ray tomography stands
out for its large depth of view (allowing for 10 µm thick biological samples to
be imaged without further thinning), its resolution (about 50 nm for
tomographies, sufficient to detect viral particles), the minimal requirements for
sample manipulation (can be used on frozen, unfixed and unstained whole cells)
and the potential to be combined with other techniques (i.e., correlative
fluorescence microscopy). In this review we describe the fundamentals of
cryo-soft X-ray tomography, its sample requirements, its advantages and its
limitations. To highlight the potential of this technique, examples of virus
research performed at BL09-MISTRAL beamline in ALBA synchrotron are also
presented.
