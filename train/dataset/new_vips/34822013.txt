Affordable point-of-care (POC) CD4 + T lymphocyte counting techniques have been
developed as alternatives to flow cytometry-based instruments caring for patients
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. However, POC CD4 enumeration
technologies can be inaccurate. Here, we developed a microparticle-based visual
detector of CD4 + T lymphocytes (ImmunoSpin) using microparticles conjugated with
anti-CD4 antibodies, independent of microfluidic or fluorescence detection
systems. Visual enumeration of CD4 + T cells under conventional light microscope 
was accurate compared to flow cytometry. Microparticle-tagged CD4 + T cells were 
well-recognized under a light microscope. ImmunoSpin showed very good precision
(coefficients of variation of ImmunoSpin were ≤ 10%) and high correlation with
clinical-grade flow cytometry for the enumeration of CD4 + T cells
(y = 0.4232 + 0.9485 × for the %CD4 + T cell count, R2 = 0.99). At thresholds of 
200 and 350 cells/µL, there was no misclassification of the ImmunoSpin system
compared to the reference flow cytometry. ImmunoSpin showed clear differential
classification of CD4 + T lymphocytes from granulocytes and monocytes. Because
non-fluorescence microparticle-tags and cytospin slides are used in ImmunoSpin,
they can be applied to an automatic digital image analyzer. Slide preparation
allows long-term storage, no analysis time limitations, and image transfer in
remote areas.
