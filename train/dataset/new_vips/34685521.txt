Specific memory B cells and antibodies are a reliable read-out of vaccine
efficacy. We analysed these biomarkers after one and two doses of BNT162b2
vaccine. The second dose significantly increases the level of highly specific
memory B cells and antibodies. Two months after the second dose, specific
antibody levels decline, but highly specific memory B cells continue to increase,
thus predicting a sustained protection from COVID-19. We show that although
mucosal IgA is not induced by the vaccination, memory B cells migrate in response
to inflammation and secrete IgA at mucosal sites. We show that the first vaccine 
dose may lead to an insufficient number of highly specific memory B cells and low
concentration of serum antibodies, thus leaving vaccinees without the immune
robustness needed to ensure viral elimination and herd immunity. We also clarify 
that the reduction of serum antibodies does not diminish the force and duration
of the immune protection induced by vaccination. The vaccine does not induce
sterilizing immunity. Infection after vaccination may be caused by the lack of
local preventive immunity because of the absence of mucosal IgA.
