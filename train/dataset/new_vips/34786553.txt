Background: Measures of distancing, wearing face/medical masks and lockdown
introduced in many countries to meet the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
have led to gross changes in the epidemiology of important infections. The
observation of decline of positive norovirus tests after introduction of lockdown
in Germany led us to investigate changes in the detection of major causes of
diarrhoea by comparing pre-pandemic quarters (PPQ: 1Q/17 through 1Q/20) since
2017 and pandemic quarters (PQ: 2Q/20 through 1Q/21).
Methods and setting: Bioscientia Laboratory Ingelheim is a large regional
clinical pathology laboratory serving > 50 hospitals and > 5000 general
practitioners and specialist outpatient practices located in the federal states
Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Antigen
detection assays were used for detection of astrovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus,
and Campylobacter antigen and Clostridium difficile Toxin A/B, while norovirus
was detected by qualitative RT-PCR.
Findings: The mean positivity-ratios of norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus
assays were 3-20 fold lower in periods PQ (2Q/20 through 1Q/21) compared to PPQ
(1Q/17 through 1Q/20) (p<.01). The mean positivity-ratio was lower in PQ compared
to PPQ for rotavirus (p=.31), but failed to reach statistical significance, while
for campylobacter antigen (p=.91) and C. difficile Toxin A/B (p=.17) the mean
positivity-ratio was even higher in PQ compared to PPQ.
Conclusions: Apparently, hygienic measures used to contain the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic have differential effects on incidence of diarrhoea viruses as compared 
to bacterial gastrointestinal agents, particularly C. difficile, which may lead
to re-evaluate measures implemented against this important cause of nosocomial
diarrhoea.
