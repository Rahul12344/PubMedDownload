This study was conducted on elementary school students in Henan Province, China, 
from February 4th to 11th, 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
epidemic. The purpose of the study was to examine the prevalence of anxiety among
students and identify the related risk factors contributing to anxiety.
Demographic information and psychological status were assessed by using
self-reported measures. The generalized anxiety disorder tool (GAD-7) and a
multiple logistic regression model were used to assess anxiety and identify
potential influencing factors. Cross-sectional data indicated that the overall
anxiety prevalence was 13.4%. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest
among rural primary school students and lowest among city students. Three groups 
of students in different regions were surveyed, and the prevalence of anxiety
symptoms was significantly higher among students with poor knowledge of COVID-19 
than among students with good knowledge of COVID-19. After adjusting for
potential confounding factors, it was found that location, knowledge, and
practice were related to anxiety. This study showed that the prevalence of
anxiety symptoms was higher among Chinese primary school students. The
influencing factors found in this study may help relevant staff improve the
mental health of children during the epidemic.
