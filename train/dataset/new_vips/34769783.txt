This study utilizes modeling and simulation to analyze coronavirus (COVID-19)
infection trends depending on government policies. Two modeling requirements are 
considered for infection simulation: (1) the implementation of social distancing 
policies and (2) the representation of population movements. To this end, we
propose an extended infection model to combine analytical models with discrete
event-based simulation models in a hybrid form. Simulation parameters for social 
distancing policies are identified and embedded in the analytical models.
Administrative districts are modeled as a fundamental simulation agent, which
facilitates representing the population movements between the cities. The
proposed infection model utilizes real-world data regarding suspected, infected, 
recovered, and deceased people in South Korea. As an application, we simulate the
COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. We use real-world data for 160 days, containing
meaningful days that begin the distancing policy and adjust the distancing policy
to the next stage. We expect that the proposed work plays a principal role in
analyzing how social distancing effectively affects virus prevention and provides
a simulation environment for the biochemical field.
