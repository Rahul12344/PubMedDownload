Interventions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with
substantial reductions in exacerbations of airways diseases, likely through
reduced transmission of other respiratory viruses. We surveyed 4442 people with
airways disease (asthma=3627, bronchiectasis=258, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease=557) to gauge attitudes and intentions towards continuing such measures
after the COVID-19 pandemic. 47% intended to continue wearing a face mask in
indoor public spaces, and 61% thought everyone should be required to do so during
the 'influenza season. Women, those with bronchiectasis, and older people were
generally more cautious. Respiratory virus infection control measures should be
considered in clinical guidelines and public health recommendations.
