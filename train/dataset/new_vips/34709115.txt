Biosurfactants are natural surfactants produced by a variety of microorganisms.
In recent years, biosurfactants have garnered a lot of interest due to their
biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Sophorolipids are glycolipids types
of biosurfactants produced by selected non-pathogenic yeasts. In addition to the 
detergent activity (reduction in surface and interfacial tension), which is
commonly utilized by biomedical applications, sophorolipids have shown some
unique properties such as, antiviral activity against enveloped viruses,
immunomodulation, and anticancer activity. Considering their antiviral activity, 
the potential of sophorolipids as an antiviral therapy for the treatment of
COVID-19 is discussed in this review. Being a surfactant molecule, sophorolipid
could solubilize the lipid envelope of SARS-CoV-2 and inactivate it. As an
immunomodulator, sophorolipid could attenuate the cytokine storm caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 upon infection, and inhibit the progression of COVID-19 in patients.
Sophorolipids could also be used as an effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 
patients suffering from cancer. However, there is limited research on the use of 
sophorolipid as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer and viral
diseases, and to modulate the immune response. Nevertheless, the multitasking
capabilities of sophorolipids make them potential therapeutic candidates for the 
bench-to-bedside research for the treatment of COVID-19.
