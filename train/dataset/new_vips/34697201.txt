BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, pedicle flaps
(instead of free flaps) were recommended for reconstruction following wide
resection for patients with head and neck cancer, in order to reduce the use of
medical resources. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for
patients with head and neck cancer with synchronous esophageal cancer.
CASE REPORT: We present a 68-year-old male with cT4aN2cM0 oral floor and
synchronous cT1bN1M0 esophageal cancers who had defective reconstruction
following oral tumor resection before esophagectomy during the pandemic. At the
initial surgery, the oral resected defect was reconstructed using supraclavicular
artery flap. The subsequent esophagectomy was reconstructed by gastric tube
reconstruction. Both postoperative courses were successful, without the need for 
postoperative ventilator use. The days from initial or second surgery to
discharge were 14 or 16 days, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This case had achieved negative surgical margins and recovered oral
intake with tracheostomy decannulation. Further case accruement using
supraclavicular artery flap is required for patients with head and neck cancer
and synchronous esophageal cancer.
