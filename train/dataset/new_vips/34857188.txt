In the early months of 2020, Europe was confronted by a pandemic that originated 
in China, which initially affected its territories in different ways. Parts of
northern Italy were among the regions most affected. At the same time, Ticino, a 
small canton of Switzerland geographically wedged into Italian territory, had an 
incidence rate comparable to that of hard-hit Lombardy. Home to 350,000
inhabitants and separated from the rest of Switzerland by the Alps, Ticino had to
face the first part of the pandemic with little available knowledge. The cantonal
authorities decided to transform two active hospitals into COVID centres,
concentrating all coronavirus patients there. Since the virus was new and there
were no clear guidelines for managing it, the nutritional team on site had to
reorganise to provide patient care, adapting their strategy to accommodate the
evolution of the pandemic and growing medical knowledge. This paper explains how 
one of these teams developed a model to deal with the first wave of COVID,
maintaining it during the second and current third wave of the pandemic.
