ABSTRACT: At the beginning of the pandemic, little was known about the effect of 
COVID-19 on children, urging pediatric health care systems to rapidly,
efficiently, and safely address new challenges. This article describes
structural, procedural, and functional changes developed in a pediatric ED to
respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion also includes case studies to
illustrate the changes made.
