Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is one of the most widespread viruses that infects a 
large number of cultivated crops worldwide and causes severe losses. Besides
vegetables and ornamental crops, it is also spreading on medicinal and aromatic
plants (MAPs) at an alarming rate. Natural occurrence of green mosaic, leaf
curling, necrosis, and distortion were observed on the leaves of Salvia sclarea
in the experimental field of CSIR-CIMAP, Lucknow, India. Mechanical transmission 
assay, morphological features, CP gene, and RNA3-based genomic characterization
revealed the association of a new CMV isolate with the present disease. Virus is 
mechanically sap transmissible to the test plants. Transmission electron
microscopy showed the presence of isodiametric particles of ~ 28 nm in diameter. 
Phylogenetic studies revealed that RNA3 (~ 2.2 kb) belongs to the subgroup IA of 
CMV. Multiple sequence alignment of amino acid sequences showed that MP possesses
two unique changes in the RNA-binding domain and CP was found to be the conserved
one with one change only. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report 
of a CMV isolate infecting S. sclarea.
