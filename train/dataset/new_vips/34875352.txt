Oncolytic viruses (OV) selectively replicate in and destroy cancer cells
resulting in anti-tumor immunity. However, clinical use remains a challenge
because of virus clearance upon intravenous delivery. OV packaging using a
nanomedicine approach could overcome this. Here we encapsulate an oncolytic
adenovirus (Ad[I/PPT-E1A]) into CCL2-coated liposomes in order to exploit
recruitment of CCR2-expressing circulating monocytes into tumors. We demonstrate 
successful encapsulation of Ad[I/PPT-E1A] into CCL2-coated liposomes that were
preferentially taken up by CCR2-expressing monocytes. No complex-related
toxicities were observed following incubation with prostate tumor cells and the
encapsulation did not affect virus oncolytic activity in vitro. Furthermore,
intravenous administration of our nanomedicine resulted in a significant
reduction in tumor size and pulmonary metastasis in prostate cancer-bearing mice 
whereby a 1000-fold less virus was needed compared to Ad[I/PPT-E1A] alone. Taken 
together our data provides an opportunity to target OV via circulation to
inaccessible tumors using liposome-assisted drug delivery.
