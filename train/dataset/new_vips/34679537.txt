SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus from the Coronaviridae family and its rapid spread is
now the most important medical problem worldwide. Currently used tests vary in
the number and selection of SARS-CoV-2 target genes. Meanwhile, the choice of the
appropriate target gene may be important in terms of a reliable detection of a
viral RNA. As some researchers questioned the sensitivity of the monogenic
VIASURE SARS-CoV-2 S gene Real Time PCR Detection Kit (CerTest Biotec, Zaragoza, 
Spain) in mid-2020, the aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of this
kit, used along with the BD MAX™ System (Becton Dickinson, East Rutherford, NJ,
USA), and compare the results with two-gene Bosphore Novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) Detection Kit v1 (Anatolia Diagnostics and Biotechnology Products
Inc., Istanbul, Turkey). Both tests were carried out on 306
nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. The consistent results (72 positive and 225
negative results found simultaneously in both kits) were obtained for 297 (97.1%)
samples altogether, while discrepancies between the results of the evaluated
tests were observed for nine (2.9%) specimens. There were no statistically
significant differences between the method used and the frequency of positive
results. Both tests, targeted at detecting one and two genes, are effective in
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.
