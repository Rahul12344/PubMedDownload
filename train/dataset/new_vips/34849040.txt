Propose: The inception of the COVID-19 has put health-care workers (HCWs) in a
precarious situation across the world. In spite of the challenges in Jordan, the 
high awareness and preparedness of HCWs made it feasible for the country to
control the contagious virus. The study aimed to provide a useful insight into
availability of PPE among HCWs in Jordan, which could help the
policy/decision-makers of public health to design better programs based on the
information reported.
Methods: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during July 2020 for
the evaluation of the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) among
HCWs in Jordan.
Results: A total of 751 HCWs responded from different parts of the country, who
were actively working at different hospitals in Jordan. The majority of the
participants (94%) reported having sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 and more
than two-thirds of participants (68%) reported that PPE were provided by the
Jordanian Ministry of Health. The majority (91%) of participants reported
availability of medical face masks, while only 26% reported having facial
protective shields.
Conclusion: The study highlighted sufficient availability of PPE during the
COVID-19 pandemic, which may have caused minimal infection rates among HCWs in
Jordan.
