Background: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare hematopoietic neoplasm of
histiocytic origin characterized by an insidious course. The coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous strain on healthcare systems
worldwide both directly and indirectly, resulting in the disruption of healthcare
services to prevent, diagnose and manage non-COVID-19 disease. Case Presentation:
We describe the case of a 58-year-old male patient with sporadic episodes of
self-resolving mild fever and anemia of chronic disease with onset two years
before the current presentation. Positron emission/computed tomography scan
revealed the presence of moderately hypermetabolic perirenal tissue masses. In
order to achieve diagnosis, repeated perirenal tissue biopsies were performed,
and the diagnostic evaluation was complicated by the strain put on the healthcare
system by the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient contracted SARS-CoV-2 and required
hospitalization, but recovered fully. No further ECD target organ involvement was
documented. Treatment options were presented, but the patient chose to defer
treatment for ECD. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion and multidisciplinary
team collaboration is paramount to achieve diagnosis in rare conditions such as
ECD. Disruptions in healthcare services in the pandemic milieu may
disproportionately affect people with rare diseases and further study and effort 
is required to better meet their needs in the pandemic setting.
