The global epidemic of COVID-19 makes people realize that wearing a mask is one
of the most effective ways to protect ourselves from virus infections, which
poses serious challenges for the existing face recognition system. To tackle the 
difficulties, a new method for masked face recognition is proposed by integrating
a cropping-based approach with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM).
The optimal cropping is explored for each case, while the CBAM module is adopted 
to focus on the regions around eyes. Two special application scenarios, using
faces without mask for training to recognize masked faces, and using masked faces
for training to recognize faces without mask, have also been studied.
Comprehensive experiments on SMFRD, CISIA-Webface, AR and Extend Yela B datasets 
show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of
masked face recognition compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.
