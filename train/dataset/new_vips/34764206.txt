Understanding pathways that might impact coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
manifestations and disease outcomes is necessary for better disease management
and for therapeutic development. Here, we analyzed alterations in sphingolipid
(SL) levels upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection induced elevation of SL levels in both cells
and sera of infected mice. A significant increase in glycosphingolipid levels was
induced early post SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was essential for viral
replication. This elevation could be reversed by treatment with glucosylceramide 
synthase inhibitors. Levels of sphinganine, sphingosine, GA1, and GM3 were
significantly increased in both cells and the murine model upon SARS-CoV-2
infection. The potential involvement of SLs in COVID-19 pathology is discussed.
