Background: Clinically, evidence shows that uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma 
(UCEC) patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) may have a higher death-rate. However, current anti-UCEC/coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment is lacking. Plumbagin (PLB), a
pharmacologically active alkaloid, is an emerging anti-cancer inhibitor.
Accordingly, the current report was designed to identify and characterize the
anti-UCEC function and mechanism of PLB in the treatment of patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2 via integrated in silico analysis.
Methods: The clinical analyses of UCEC and COVID-19 in patients were conducted
using online-accessible tools. Meanwhile, in silico methods including network
pharmacology and biological molecular docking aimed to screen and characterize
the anti-UCEC/COVID-19 functions, bio targets, and mechanisms of the action of
PLB.
Results: The bioinformatics data uncovered the clinical characteristics of UCEC
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, including specific genes, health risk,
survival rate, and prognostic index. Network pharmacology findings disclosed that
PLB-exerted anti-UCEC/COVID-19 effects were achieved through anti-proliferation, 
inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis, anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and
modulation of some of the key molecular pathways associated with
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating actions. Following molecular docking
analysis, in silico investigation helped identify the anti-UCEC/COVID-19
pharmacological bio targets of PLB, including mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 
(MAPK3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(PLAU).
Conclusions: Based on the present bioinformatic and in silico findings, the
clinical characterization of UCEC/COVID-19 patients was revealed. The candidate, 
core bio targets, and molecular pathways of PLB action in the potential treatment
of UCEC/COVID-19 were identified accordingly.
