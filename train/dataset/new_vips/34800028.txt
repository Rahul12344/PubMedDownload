Multiple manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described in the
literature. Among them also oral lesions were present. These lesions seem to be
very important because they are seen in various clinical presentation and should 
be taken into consideration in the COVID-19 diagnosis.A lot of changes and oral
mucosal lesions have been described as oral manifestation of COVID-19. The most
frequently observed were: aphte - like erosions, virus herpes - like erosions,
oral ulcers, petechie, reddisch macule, erythema, depapilation of the tongue
surface, oral hyperpigmentation, presence of opportunistic Candida infections.
There is no clear evidence if oral lesions in the course of COVID-19 are related 
to oral mucosal damage or are due to opportunistic infections or intensive
COVID-19 treatment. The next observation and study are needed to describe this
relationship. However the knowledge about oral manifestation of SARS-CoV- 2
infection is important. Currently in the pandemic time even in the patients
without infection confirmed by the PCR method but also in those only suspected of
infection, every oral mucosa lesion might be regarded as related with COVID-19.
