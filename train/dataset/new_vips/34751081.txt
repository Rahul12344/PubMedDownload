CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 virus on the
retinochoroidal vasculature can provide valuable information regarding potential 
multi-organ ischaemic sequelae in COVID-19 patients, and can thus be a useful
tool for optometrists, ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, infectious disease
specialists and others.
BACKGROUND: Assessment of retinochoroidal vasculature alterations in recovered
mild COVID-19 patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) when
compared to age and ethnic matched controls.
METHODS: Multimodal imaging was performed using OCTA, spectral domain (SD)-OCT
(Optovue RTVue XR Avanti; Optovue, Inc, Fremont, CA), and colour fundus
photography (Compass; iCare Inc, Raleigh, NC). Vessel flow density, foveal
avascular zone, foveal perimeter circumference and retinal thickness were
calculated automatically by the OCTA software on 6 × 6mm angiograms. Morphologic 
changes in the retinochoroidal vasculature on OCTA were assessed and compared
with the findings on fundoscopy, SD-OCT and fundus photography and were evaluated
by two trained graders.
RESULTS: Mean vessel parafoveal density, superior and inferior hemispheric vessel
density and perifoveal temporal vessel density on 6 × 6 angiograms of the
superficial capillary plexus were lower among the COVID-19 patients when compared
to their age and ethnic matched controls. Vessel flow density of the deep
capillary plexus, foveal avascular zone size and circumference and retinal
thickness did not illustrate statistical significance between the groups.
CONCLUSION: OCTA provides non-invasive high-resolution imaging of the
retinochoroidal vascular network. Compared with conventional imaging, OCTA can
demonstrate precise microvascular structural alterations in the retinal vessels
before visible on SD-OCT or fundus examination. When matched for age and
ethnicity, patients with a history of mild COVID illness manifested alterations
in vessel density.
