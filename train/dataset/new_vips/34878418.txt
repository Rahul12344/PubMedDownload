PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the population of the world is aging the number of
geriatric patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) is also increasing. They
pose a unique challenge for the caregivers, as they have age-related
physiological changes, multiple comorbidities and cirrhosis-related pathologies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Twenty-two percent of patients who undergo LT are older than 65 
years. Many patients suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis-C virus. Incidence of NASH tends to
increase with age, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Elderly patients
require comprehensive cognitive, cardiac and pulmonary evaluation prior to LT.
Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension
and frailty are of specific concern.
SUMMARY: Proportion of elderly patients who are undergoing LT continues to
increase. These patients require comprehensive cardiopulmonary and frailty
evaluation. Consensus-based practice advisories need to be developed to
standardize preoperative evaluation of geriatric patients awaiting LT.
