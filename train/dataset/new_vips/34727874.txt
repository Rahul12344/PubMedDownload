BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and spread throughout the world due to
its rapid transmission. The exposure rate in the healthy population is unknown,
mainly in resource-limited countries. Herein, we estimated the seroprevalence of 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and risk factors among blood donors in Luanda, the
capital city of Angola.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted with 343 blood donors.
Chi-square and logistic regression were calculated to predict the independent
variable for SARS-CoV-2 infection and deemed significant when p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 4.7%. Positivity rates varied to
age groups (3.5-14.3%), gender (0-5%), area of residence (3.1-.6%), educational
level (5.1-10.2%), occupation (4.4-7.7%), and the blood donor category
(2.0-5.1%). Past and recent infections were detected in 3.2% and 1.5%,
respectively. Blood donors under the age of 20 years (OR: 4.58, p = 0.241) and
from non-urbanized areas (OR: 1.86, p = 0.293) presented a high risk related to
infection. The infection was higher in blood group A and lower in blood group O. 
The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased from January 2020 (OR: 0.03,
p = 0.001) to August 2020 (OR: 0.57, p = 0.426).
CONCLUSIONS: We provide an estimate of the exposure of healthy blood donors in
Luanda. Also, we detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020, indicating that the
SARS-CoV-2 could have been imported during the first month of 2020. Further
studies should be performed to assess the exposure rate in different groups from 
Angola.
