Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in the world, but this problem is especially significant in
low-resource countries where HCC screening recommendations and strategies are
limited. We describe a rare complication of newly diagnosed HCC in a patient with
untreated hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, underscoring the importance of
improving screening strategies and promoting early diagnosis of HCC in
Sub-Saharan Africa.
