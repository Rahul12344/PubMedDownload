Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent
responsible for the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected
over 185 million individuals across 200 countries since December 2019 resulting
in 4.0 million deaths. While COVID-19 is primarily associated with respiratory
illnesses, an increasing number of clinical reports indicate that severely ill
patients often develop thrombotic complications that are associated with
increased mortality. As a consequence, treatment strategies that target
COVID-associated thrombosis are of utmost clinical importance. An array of
pharmacologically active compounds from natural products exhibit effects on blood
coagulation pathways, and have generated interest for their potential therapeutic
applications towards thrombotic diseases. In particular, a number of snake venom 
compounds exhibit high specificity on different blood coagulation factors and
represent excellent tools that could be utilized to treat thrombosis. The aim of 
this review is to provide a brief summary of the current understanding of
COVID-19 associated thrombosis, and highlight several snake venom compounds that 
could be utilized as antithrombotic agents to target this disease.
