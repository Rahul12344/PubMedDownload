Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies 
as possible therapeutics in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the current drug repurposing study, we identified 
the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist montelukast as a novel agent that
simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially
demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of montelukast through multiscale
molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by 
different in vitro experiments including the enzyme (main protease)
inhibition-based assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus
neutralization on HEK293T/hACE2+TMPRSS2, and virus neutralization assay using
xCELLigence MP real-time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro
results confirmed the dual potential effect of montelukast both on the main
protease enzyme inhibition and virus entry into the host cell (spike/ACE2). The
virus neutralization assay results showed that SARS-CoV-2 virus activity was
delayed with montelukast for 20 h on the infected cells. The rapid use of new
small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and
has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be
completed in clinical phase studies and, if its effect is proved in clinical
phase studies, it should be used against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
