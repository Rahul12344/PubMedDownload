Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune condition characterized by
platelet destruction through antibody-mediated mechanism. ITP is one of the
manifestations of a coronavirus disease, as well as an adverse event occurring
after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Several cases of ITP have been described after vaccination with two
mRNA-based vaccines-BTN162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)-against
SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report a case of ITP occurring after vaccination with
ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine in Korea. A 66-year-old
woman presented with multiple ecchymoses on both upper and lower extremities and 
gingival bleeding, appearing 3 days after receiving the first dose of ChAdOx1
nCoV-19. Her laboratory results showed isolated severe thrombocytopenia without
evidence of combined coagulopathy. She was diagnosed with ITP and successfully
treated with high-dose dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin. Clinical
suspicion to identify vaccine-related ITP is important to promptly initiate
appropriate treatment.
