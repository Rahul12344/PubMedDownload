The SARS-CoV-2 virus is rapidly evolving via mutagenesis, lengthening the
pandemic, and threatening the public health. Until August 2021, 12 variants of
SARS-CoV-2 named as variants of concern (VOC; Alpha to Delta) or variants of
interest (VOI; Epsilon to Mu), with significant impact on transmissibility,
morbidity, possible reinfection and mortality, have been identified. The VOC
Delta (B.1.617.2) of Indian origin is now the dominant and the most contagious
variant worldwide as it provokes a strong binding to the human ACE2 receptor,
increases transmissibility and manifests considerable immune escape strategies
after natural infection or vaccination. Although the development and
administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, based on different technologies (mRNA,
adenovirus carrier, recombinant protein, etc.), are very promising for the
control of the pandemic, their effectiveness and neutralizing activity against
VOCs varies significantly. In this review, we describe the most significant
circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, and the known effectiveness of currently
available vaccines against them.
