Acute fulminant necrotising colitis is an uncommon presentation of amoebiasis,
which can be precipitated after corticosteroid therapy. Clinicians treating
patients with COVID-19 with corticosteroid therapy should be familiar with this
condition to avoid delay in diagnosis. The disease is associated with high
mortality, and prompt diagnosis and management are essential for salvaging
patients. We report successful management of a patient who developed this
complication following administration of steroids for COVID-19.
