Lip abscess is a rare condition encountered in clinical practice. Generally, it
may be due to an infective agent, such as virus, bacteria, entering through a
skin wound, or it can be seen through hematogenous spread when there is a serious
underlying condition such as a general condition disorder or immunodeficiency. It
requires rapid diagnosis and treatment as it may cause significant complications 
in terms of localization and lymphovascular drainage. In this case report, an
18-year-old male patient with unilateral lip abscess that regressed rapidly with 
external drainage and antibiotic therapy is presented with imaging and
clinical-laboratory findings.
