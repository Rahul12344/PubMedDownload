Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare form of stroke that can present with various
clinical features. In addition, it can present with nonspecific neurological
features, and initial computed tomography (CT) cannot rule it out even if
negative. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a hypercoagulable
state; however, it is not much discussed. Here, we present a case of a
24-year-old immunocompetent female who presented with acute meningeal symptoms.
She was managed as a case of an opportunistic central nervous system infection at
initial presentation, which did not resolve her symptoms completely. Later,
however, cerebral thrombosis was diagnosed, and she improved symptomatically on
anticoagulants.
