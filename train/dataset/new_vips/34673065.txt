The State of Nevada, USA Administrative Code requires a 12-log enteric virus
reduction/inactivation, 10-log Giardia cyst reduction, and 10-log Cryptosporidium
oocyst reduction for Category A+ reclaimed water suitable for indirect potable
reuse (IPR) based on raw wastewater to potable reuse water. Accurately
demonstrating log10 reduction values (LRVs) through secondary biological
treatment prior to an advanced water treatment train enables redundancy and
resiliency for IPR projects while maintaining a high level of public confidence. 
LRVs for Cryptosporidium and Giardia resulting from secondary biological
treatment are not fully established due to a wide range of performance
variabilities resulting from different types of secondary biological treatment
processes employed in water reclamation. A one-year investigation of two
full-scale northern Nevada (e.g. ≤4 mgd; 1.5 × 107 L/day) water reclamation
facilities (WRFs) was conducted to monitor Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia
cysts in untreated wastewater and secondary effluent. This study aimed at
establishing secondary treatment LRVs, monitor WRF performance and attempted to
correlate performance to protozoan reduction. California's IPR regulations, in
which Nevada IPR regulations were modeled after, were based on a maximum
concentration of 5-logs (cysts/L) of Giardia and 4-logs (oocysts/L) of
Cryptosporidium. The recovery-corrected Giardia and Cryptosporidium
concentrations measured in untreated influent (20 samples each at each WRF) were 
below 5-log cysts/L at the 99th percentile (maximum 4.4-log cysts/L) and 4-log
oocysts/L (maximum 2.7 log oocysts/L), respectively. Both secondary treatment
WRFs produced secondary effluent that is consistently better than federal and the
State of Nevada requirements and perform within an operating envelop for other
secondary facilities. Given the results, it appears that a minimum conservative
estimate for LRVs for well-operated secondary activated sludge treatment plants
(at the 5th percentile) of 0.5 LRV credit for Cryptosporidium and 2.0 LRV for
Giardia is warranted. These minimum LRVs are consistent with a conservative
review of the available literature.
