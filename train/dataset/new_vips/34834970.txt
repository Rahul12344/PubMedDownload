Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV) can cause severe neurological complications in
humans, but differences in tissue tropism and pathogenicity have been described
for individual virus strains. Viral protein synthesis leads to the induction of
the unfolded protein response (UPR) within infected cells. The IRE1 pathway has
been hypothesized to support flavivirus replication by increasing protein and
lipid biogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of the UPR in TBFV infection in 
human astrocytes, neuronal and intestinal cell lines that had been infected with 
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) strains Neudoerfl and MucAr-HB-171/11 as
well as Langat virus (LGTV). Both TBEV strains replicated better than LGTV in
central nervous system (CNS) cells. TBEV strain MucAr-HB-171/11, which is
associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, replicated best in intestinal cells.
All three viruses activated the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway via
the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Interestingly, the neurotropic TBEV strain
Neudoerfl induced a strong upregulation of XBP1 in all cell types, but with
faster kinetics in CNS cells. In contrast, TBEV strain MucAr-HB-171/11 failed to 
activate the IRE1 pathway in astrocytes. The low pathogenic LGTV led to a mild
induction of IRE1 signaling in astrocytes and intestinal cells. When cells were
treated with IRE1 inhibitors prior to infection, TBFV replication in astrocytes
was significantly reduced. This confirms a supporting role of the IRE1 pathway
for TBFV infection in relevant viral target cells and suggests a correlation
between viral tissue tropism and the cell-type dependent induction of the
unfolded protein response.
