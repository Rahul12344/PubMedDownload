The development of antiviral agents with an original structure and noticeable
effect is always in great need. Natural products are important lead compounds in 
the development of new pesticides. Crocin-1 and crocin-2 were effectively
isolated from Gardeniae fructus and found to have higher anti-tobacco mosaic
virus (TMV) activity levels than ribavirin. A series of the crocetin diester
derivatives were synthesized with separated crocetin-1 as material and evaluated 
for their anti-TMV activities. They could be dissolved in common organic solvents
as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and methanol. Compounds 5, 9,
13, 14, and 15 displayed higher activities in vivo than ribavirin. Compound 14
with significantly higher antiviral activities than lead compounds (crocin-1 and 
crocin-2) emerged as a new antiviral candidate.
