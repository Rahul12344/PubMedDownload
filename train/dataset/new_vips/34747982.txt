Importance: After an infection by SARS-CoV-2, many patients present with
persistent physical symptoms that may impair their quality of life. Beliefs
regarding the causes of these symptoms may influence their perception and promote
maladaptive health behaviors.
Objective: To examine the associations of self-reported COVID-19 infection and
SARS-CoV-2 serology test results with persistent physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, 
breathlessness, or impaired attention) in the general population during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants in this cross-sectional analysis 
were 26 823 individuals from the French population-based CONSTANCES cohort,
included between 2012 and 2019, who took part in the nested SAPRIS and
SAPRIS-SERO surveys. Between May and November 2020, an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Between
December 2020 and January 2021, the participants reported whether they believed
they had experienced COVID-19 infection and had physical symptoms during the
previous 4 weeks that had persisted for at least 8 weeks. Participants who
reported having an initial COVID-19 infection only after completing the serology 
test were excluded.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Logistic regressions for each persistent symptom as
the outcome were computed in models including both self-reported COVID-19
infection and serology test results and adjusting for age, sex, income, and
educational level.
Results: Of 35 852 volunteers invited to participate in the study, 26 823 (74.8%)
with complete data were included in the present study (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [12.9]
years; 13 731 women [51.2%]). Self-reported infection was positively associated
with persistent physical symptoms, with odds ratios ranging from 1.39 (95% CI,
1.03-1.86) to 16.37 (95% CI, 10.21-26.24) except for hearing impairment (odds
ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.82-2.55) and sleep problems (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI,
0.89-1.46). A serology test result positive for SARS-COV-2 was positively
associated only with persistent anosmia (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.66-4.46),
even when restricting the analyses to participants who attributed their symptoms 
to COVID-19 infection. Further adjusting for self-rated health or depressive
symptoms yielded similar results. There was no significant interaction between
belief and serology test results.
Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional analysis of a
large, population-based French cohort suggest that persistent physical symptoms
after COVID-19 infection may be associated more with the belief in having been
infected with SARS-CoV-2 than with having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
infection. Further research in this area should consider underlying mechanisms
that may not be specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A medical evaluation of these
patients may be needed to prevent symptoms due to another disease being
erroneously attributed to "long COVID."
