BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes tens of
million infection world-wide. Many machine learning methods have been proposed
for the computer-aided diagnosis between COVID-19 and community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Most of these methods
utilized the location-specific handcrafted features based on the segmentation
results to improve the diagnose performance. However, the prerequisite
segmentation step is time-consuming and needs the intervention by lots of expert 
radiologists, which cannot be achieved in the areas with limited medical
resources.
METHODS: We propose a generative adversarial feature completion and diagnosis
network (GACDN) that simultaneously generates handcrafted features by radiomic
counterparts and makes accurate diagnoses based on both original and generated
features. Specifically, we first calculate the radiomic features from the CT
images. Then, in order to fast obtain the location-specific handcrafted features,
we use the proposed GACDN to generate them by its corresponding radiomic
features. Finally, we use both radiomic features and location-specific
handcrafted features for COVID-19 diagnosis.
RESULTS: For the performance of our generated location-specific handcrafted
features, the results of four basic classifiers show that it has an average of
3.21% increase in diagnoses accuracy. Besides, the experimental results on
COVID-19 dataset show that our proposed method achieved superior performance in
COVID-19 vs. community acquired pneumonia (CAP) classification compared with the 
state-of-the-art methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method significantly improves the diagnoses accuracy of
COVID-19 vs. CAP in the condition of incomplete location-specific handcrafted
features. Besides, it is also applicable in some regions lacking of expert
radiologists and high-performance computing resources.
