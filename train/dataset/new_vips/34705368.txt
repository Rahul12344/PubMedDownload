ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 manifests mainly as respiratory symptoms. Extrapulmonary
manifestations have also been detected and several vital organs may sustain
irreversible or long-standing damage. These extrapulmonary manifestations can be 
detected in cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and hematologic systems.
Maxillofacial surgeons may encounter patients who have recovered from COVID-19
but are still suffering long-term morbidities as a result of this incompletely
understood infection. Consequently, they have to be aware of the various systemic
complications that may be encountered in these patients as they may interfere
with their treatment plan or may necessitate certain modifications and
precautions.In this report the authors present the long-standing systemic
complications of COVID-19 reported so far, and discuss their implications within 
the context of maxillofacial surgery with regards to the modifications and
precautions in the process of treatment planning.Graphical abstract shows the
long-term complications of COVID-19 that may complicate maxillofacial surgical
procedures.
