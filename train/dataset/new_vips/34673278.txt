Global health electives in neurology residencies provide opportunities for
high-income country trainees, but have limited benefits-and may create
burdens-for lower-income country hosts. Current suspension of global health
electives for U.S. neurology residents due to the COVID-19 pandemic provides an
opportunity to reflect on ways to reimagine global health education during this
period and beyond. The framework proposed in this article underscores the need
for equitable, bidirectional international partnerships and highlights global
health educational innovations developed during the pandemic.
