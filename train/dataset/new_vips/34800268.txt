INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to assess hepcidin levels and iron
metabolism in otherwise healthy human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected
males and the influence of antiretroviral therapy on hepcidin production, as data
in this group are scarce.
METHODS: A total of 89 HIV-1-infected males, 42 on effective antiretroviral
therapy (ART)-group A, 47 treatment-naïve-group B, and 27 healthy controls-group 
C, were enrolled. Erythrocytes parameters, iron metabolism parameters, hepcidin, 
highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and soluble
transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels were assessed. Conditions related to
inflammatory activity, systemic metabolic diseases and iron supplementation were 
exclusion criteria. Convenience sampling was used.
RESULTS: Median age in HIV-1 group was 33 years, and 27 years in the control
group. Median CD4+ T-cell count was 724 cells/μl in group A, and 488 cells/μl in 
group B (p = 0.0000). Nadir CD4+ T-cell count was 397 cells/μl in group A and 475
cells/μl in group B (p = 0.0001). Median value of HIV-1 viral load (VL) in group 
B was 16 900 copies/mL. The hepcidin value was lower in group A than in groups B 
(p = 0.0008) or C (p = 0.0004), without differences between groups B and C. The
hepcidin value correlated with ferritin in groups A (r2 = 0.16; p = 0.008) and B 
(r2 = 0.39; p = 0.000), but not in group C (r2 = 0.11; p = 0.09). In group A, the
hepcidin value correlated with current CD4+ count (r = 0.48, p = 0.0012), but
there was no correlation in group B. There were no correlations of hepcidin
values with CD4+ T cell nadir in group A (p = 0.371) or in group B (p = 0.477);
ART period (p = 0.614); VL in group B (p = 0.71). No abnormalities of iron
metabolism, hsCRP, IL-6, or sTfR were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic HIV-1 infection does not cause clinically important
iron metabolism alterations or increased hepcidin production. Hepcidin values
decrease on effective antiretroviral therapy.
