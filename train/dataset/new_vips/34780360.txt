INTRODUCTION: Immunization, as a process of fighting against the COVID-19, has
gained important research appeal, but very limited endeavor has been paid for
vaccine behavioral studies in underdeveloped and developing countries. This study
explores the vaccine demand, hesitancy, and nationalism as well as vaccine
acceptance and domestic vaccine preference among young adults in Bangladesh.
METHODOLOGY: This quantitative study followed the snowball sampling technique and
collected responses from 1,018 individuals from various social media platforms.
The analysis covered both descriptive and inferential statistics including
chi-square, F-statistic, and logistic regression.
RESULTS: The findings of the fully-adjusted regression model suggest that the
individuals who had more vaccine demand were 3.29 times (95% confidence interval 
= 2.39-4.54; p < 0.001) higher to accept vaccine compared to those who had no
vaccine demand. Conversely, vaccine hesitancy was negatively associated with
vaccine acceptance. Here, the odds ratio was found 0.70 (95% confidence interval 
= 0.62-0.80; p < 0.001), which means that those who had higher vaccine hesitancy 
were about 30% less likely to accept vaccines than those who had no hesitancy. In
addition, the persons who had vaccine nationalism were 1.75 times (95% confidence
interval = 1.62-1.88; p < 0.001) more prone to prefer domestic vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that policymakers may take initiatives for
making people aware and knowledgeable about the severity and vulnerability to
specific health threats. In this concern, perception and efficacy-increasing
programs may take part in increasing protection motivation behaviors like vaccine
acceptance and (domestic) vaccine preference.
