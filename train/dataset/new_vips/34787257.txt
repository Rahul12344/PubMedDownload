INTRODUCTION: Herpesviruses, enteroviruses, and arboviruses are important because
of their clinical relevance and ability to cause meningitis, encephalitis,
meningoencephalitis, and other diseases. The clinical virology associated with
diagnostic technologies can reduce the morbidity and mortality of such
neurological manifestations. Here we aimed to identify the genomes of agents that
cause neurological syndromes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients
with suspected nervous system infections admitted to the University Hospital of
the University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, in 2017-2018.
METHODS: CSF samples collected from adult patients with neurological syndrome
symptoms and negative CSF culture results were analyzed using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and real-time PCR, and their results
were compared with their clinical symptoms. One CSF sample was obtained from each
patient.
RESULTS: Viral genomes were detected in 148/420 (35.2%) CSF samples: one of 148
(0.2%) was positive for herpes simplex virus-1; two (0.5%) for herpes simplex
virus-2; eight (1.9%) for varicella-zoster virus; four (1%) for Epstein-Barr
virus; one (0.2%) for cytomegalovirus; 32 (7.6%) for human herpesvirus-6; 30
(7.1%) for non-polio enterovirus; 67 (16.0%) for dengue virus, three (0.7%) for
yellow fever virus, and 21 (5%) for Zika virus.
CONCLUSIONS: The viral genomes were found in 35.2% of all analyzed samples,
showing the high prevalence of viruses in the nervous system and the importance
of using a nucleic acid amplification test to detect viral agents in CSF samples.
