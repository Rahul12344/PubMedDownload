BACKGROUND: The Living Evidence Map Project at the Norwegian Institute of Public 
Health (NIPH) gives an updated overview of research results and publications. As 
part of NIPH's mandate to inform evidence-based infection prevention, control and
treatment, a large group of experts are continously monitoring, assessing, coding
and summarising new COVID-19 publications. Screening tools, coding practice and
workflow are incrementally improved, but remain largely manual.
RESULTS: This paper describes how deep learning methods have been employed to
learn classification and coding from the steadily growing NIPH COVID-19 dashboard
data, so as to aid manual classification, screening and preprocessing of the
rapidly growing influx of new papers on the subject. Our main objective is to
make manual screening scalable through semi-automation, while ensuring
high-quality Evidence Map content.
CONCLUSIONS: We report early results on classifying publication topic and type
from titles and abstracts, showing that even simple neural network architectures 
and text representations can yield acceptable performance.
