Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-cell lymphomas are common in
immunocompromised patients and remain an unmet medical need. Here we report that 
MDM2 inhibitors (MDM2i) navtemadlin and idasanutlin have potent in vivo activity 
in EBV+ B-cell lymphoma established in immunocompromised mice. Tumor regression
was observed in all 5 EBV+ xenograft-associated B-cell lymphomas treated with
navtemadlin or idasanutlin. Molecular characterization showed that treatment with
MDM2i resulted in activation of p53 pathways and downregulation of cell cycle
effectors in human lymphoma cell lines that either were EBV+ or had undetectable 
expression of BCL6, a transcriptional inhibitor of the TP53 gene. Moreover,
treatment with navtemadlin resulted in tumor regression and prevented systemic
dissemination of EBV+ lymphoma derived from 2 juvenile patients with
posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases, including one whose tumor was
resistant to virus-specific T-cell therapy. These results provide
proof-of-concept for targeted therapy of EBV+ lymphoma with MDM2i and the
feasibility of using EBV infection or loss of BCL6 expression to identify
responders to MDM2i.
