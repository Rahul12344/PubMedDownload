Patients with cancer are at significantly greater risk of COVID-19 and its
complications than the general population. Since IgG antibodies remain detectable
well after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, seroprevalence can be used to
estimate the proportion of the cancer population previously infected and
potentially immune to SARS-CoV-2. The current study is a multi-center,
prospective observational study to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibody in a cancer population referred for vaccination between April and June
2021. Of a total of 270 adult patients with cancer accrued, 16% reported a
history of COVID-19 more than four weeks previously confirmed by PCR. At the same
time, serologic positivity for SARSCoV2 IgG was found in 29% of patients prior to
vaccination including nearly 20% of patients without a history of confirmed
COVID-19. Seropositivity was significantly greater in females consistent with
higher rates in patients with breast cancer and gynecologic cancers. A
seroconversion rate of 79.5% was observed in cancer patients with a history of
PCR confirmed COVID-19, less than observed in the general population. In
multivariable analysis, gender and prior history of COVID-19 were both
independently associated with seropositivity prior to vaccination. Follow-up is
continuing of this cohort of patients with cancer following vaccination to assess
antibody and clinical outcomes.
