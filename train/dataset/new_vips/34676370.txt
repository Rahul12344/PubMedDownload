As exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, highly infective respiratory viruses can
spread rapidly in the population because of lack of effective approaches to
control viral replication and spread. Niclosamide (NCM) is an old anthelminthic
drug (World Health Organization essential medicine list) with pleiotropic
pharmacological activities. Several recent publications demonstrated that NCM has
broad antiviral activities and potently inhibits viral replication, including
replication of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and dengue viruses. Unfortunately, NCM is
almost completely insoluble in water, which limits its clinical use. We developed
a cost-effective lipid nanoparticle formulation of NCM (nano NCM) using only
FDA-approved excipient and demonstrated potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection in
cells (Vero E6 and ACE2-expressing lung epithelium cells).
