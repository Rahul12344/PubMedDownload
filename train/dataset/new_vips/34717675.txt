BACKGROUND: A variety of policies have been implemented around the world in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study originally aimed to identify and
compare policy responses of different countries and their effects on the
pandemic. It quickly evolved into an identification of the heterogeneity among
existing policies and the challenges in making meaningful comparisons of the
impact of these policies.
METHODS: The process of collecting and comparing data from different sources was 
analysed through inductive thematic analysis to understand the obstacles that
impede research designed to compare COVID-19 data and related policies.
RESULTS: We identified the following obstacles: (1) no single reputable source of
information and too much noise; (2) a lack of standards for how to measure and
report data across countries; (3) variations in the content, implementation and
enforcement of policies; and (4) politics, instead of science, leading the
efforts in pandemic management.
CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity in existing policies makes it challenging to compare
the effects of various policies worldwide on the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings 
call for an automatically updated informatics infrastructure across the globe for
collecting and maintaining standardized data from multiple sources. There is a
strong need for steadfast utilization of scientific and technical experts to
inform and influence health policy. Increased investment in public health and
emergency planning is essential to overcome the current pandemic, as well as
future public health emergencies. Focused leadership and collaboration from world
leaders in a unified mission to decrease the mortality and morbidity of the
COVID-19 pandemic is imperative.
