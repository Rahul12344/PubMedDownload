The COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress as well as modified physical activity and
eating habits among university students. The objectives were to identify the
changes in body mass index (BMI) and eating disorders among university students
between 2009 and 2021. Between 2009 and 2021, five repeated cross-sectional
studies were conducted among university students who filled in an anonymous
online self-questionnaire. Age, gender, and BMI were recorded, and the SCOFF
questionnaire was used for ED screening which, in combination with BMI, allows to
identify the four broad categories of ED with the Expali algorithm. With the five
studies, 8981 university students were included in total. Obesity steadily
increased between 2009 and 2021, for both men and women. The prevalence of ED was
stable between 2009 and 2018 and significantly increased from 31.8% in 2018 to
51.8% in 2021 for women (p&nbsp;trend < 0.0001), and from 13.0% in 2009 to 31.3% 
in 2021 for men (p&nbsp;trend < 0.0001). All types of ED increased significantly 
between 2009 and 2021, except for restrictive ED among men. These results
indicate for the first time a significant increase in ED prevalence among
students since the COVID-19 pandemic. Initiatives to reinforce early screening of
ED to implement targeted interventions in the student population are urgently
needed.
