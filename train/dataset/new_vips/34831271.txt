Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is an evolutionarily conserved and multifunctional protein
that drives inflammation in disease. Gal-3's role in the central nervous system
has been less studied than in the immune system. However, recent studies show it 
exacerbates Alzheimer's disease and is upregulated in a large variety of brain
injuries, while loss of Gal-3 function can diminish symptoms of neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer's. Several novel molecular pathways for Gal-3 were
recently uncovered. It is a natural ligand for TREM2 (triggering receptor
expressed on myeloid cells), TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), and IR (insulin
receptor). Gal-3 regulates a number of pathways including stimulation of bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and modulating Wnt signalling in a
context-dependent manner. Gal-3 typically acts in pathology but is now known to
affect subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the healthy
brain. Despite its myriad interactors, Gal-3 has surprisingly specific and
important functions in regulating SVZ neurogenesis in disease. Gal-1, a similar
lectin often co-expressed with Gal-3, also has profound effects on brain
pathology and adult neurogenesis. Remarkably, Gal-3's carbohydrate recognition
domain bears structural similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein
necessary for cell entry. Gal-3 can be targeted pharmacologically and is a valid 
target for several diseases involving brain inflammation. The wealth of molecular
pathways now known further suggest its modulation could be therapeutically
useful.
