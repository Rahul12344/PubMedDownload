CONTEXT: Chinese herbs such as Cortex Mori [Morus alba L. (Moraceae)] may inhibit
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but active compounds are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Screening of Cortex Mori and other herbs for anti-HIV active
compounds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HIV-1 virus (multiplicity of infection: 20), and herbs
(dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, working concentrations: 10, 1, and 0.1 mg/mL)
such as Cortex Mori, etc., were added to 786-O cells (105 cell/well). Zidovudine 
was used as a positive control. Cell survival and viral inhibition rates were
measured. The herb that was the closest inactivity to zidovudine was screened.
Mass spectrometry identified the active compounds in herbs (mobile phase: 0.05%
formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile, gradient elution, detection
wavelength: 210 nm). The effect of the compounds on reverse transcriptase (RT)
products were evaluated by real-time PCR. Gene enrichment was used to analyse
underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: With a dose of 1 mg/mL of Cortex Mori, the cell survival rate (57.94%)
and viral inhibition rate (74.95%) were closest to the effect of zidovudine
(87.87%, 79.81%, respectively). Neochlorogenic acid, one of the active
ingredients, was identified by mass spectrometry in Cortex Mori. PCR discovery
total RT products of neochlorogenic acid group (mean relative gene expression:
6.01) significantly inhibited (control: 35.42, p < 0.0001). Enrichment analysis
showed that neochlorogenic acid may act on haemopoietic cell kinase, epidermal
growth factor receptor, sarcoma, etc., thus inhibiting HIV-1 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: For people of low socioeconomic status affected by HIV, Chinese
medicine (such as Cortex Mori) has many advantages: it is inexpensive and does
not easily produce resistance. Drugs based on active ingredients may be developed
and could have important value.
