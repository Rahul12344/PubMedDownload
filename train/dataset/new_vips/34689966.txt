Blood transfusion begins with safe donor selection and testing. In the United
States, the blood supply and transfusion are highly regulated. Blood transfusion 
safety is multifaceted, whereby each of the elements of the blood safety value
chain, spanning donor recruitment and qualification, to collection, blood
processing, testing, transfusion practice, and posttransfusion surveillance, must
be optimized to minimize risk. Pathogen inactivation is a promising approach to
decrease bacterial contamination of platelets, inactivate parasites and viruses, 
and decrease risks associated with emerging and unidentified pathogens. This
article offers an overview of blood donor infectious and noninfectious testing in
the United States.
