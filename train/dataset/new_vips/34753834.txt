As of May 19, 2021, due to the increase in reported mucormycosis cases in
COVID-19 patients, mucormycosis has been declared as a notifiable disease under
Epidemic Disease Act 1897 by the Government of India with the prevalence being
140 per million population. The first case of mucormycosis in a pediatric
COVID-19 positive child has been reported in Ahmedabad1 and we should prepare
ourselves with the probability of more pediatric cases being reported in the near
future.
