Pandemics caused by viruses have threatened lives of thousands of people.
Understanding the complicated process of viral infection provides significantly
directive implication to epidemic prevention and control. Viral infection is a
complex and diverse process, and substantial studies have been complemented in
exploring the biochemical and molecular interactions between viruses and hosts.
However, the physical microenvironment where infections implement is often less
considered, and the role of mechanobiology in viral infection remains elusive.
Mechanobiology focuses on sensation, transduction, and response to intracellular 
and extracellular physical factors by tissues, cells, and extracellular matrix.
The intracellular cytoskeleton and mechanosensors have been proven to be
extensively involved in the virus life cycle. Furthermore, innovative methods
based on micro- and nanofabrication techniques are being utilized to control and 
modulate the physical and chemical cell microenvironment, and to explore how
extracellular factors including stiffness, forces, and topography regulate viral 
infection. Our current review covers how physical factors in the microenvironment
coordinate viral infection. Moreover, we will discuss how this knowledge can be
harnessed in future research on cross-fields of mechanobiology and virology.
