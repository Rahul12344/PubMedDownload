The precarious financial status of the majority of Hawai'i residents coupled with
the state's heavy reliance on tourism suggests that residents are particularly
vulnerable to increased economic hardship resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,
which temporarily shut down the tourism industry and continues to erect barriers 
for resuming operations. Understanding how Hawai'i residents prioritize access to
health care, food economics, care of 'āina, and culturally informed community in 
light of the current and future economic situation can inform policy actions that
will support public health. To that end, this paper analyzes: (1) Hawai'i
residents' views on health, specifically food security and healthcare, and their 
priorities for the future of these areas; (2) the differences between Native
Hawaiian and non-Native Hawaiian views and priorities; and (3) the differences in
views and priorities between families with higher and lower levels of economic
stability. The authors close with policy recommendations that can be seen as
medicine, or ways to heal Hawai'i, as the state shifts towards a more equitable
and sustainable future.
