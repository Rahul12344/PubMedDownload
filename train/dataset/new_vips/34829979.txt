Influenza is a respiratory virus that alone or in combination with secondary
bacterial pathogens can contribute to the development of acute pneumonia in
persons >65 years of age. Host innate immune antiviral signaling early in
response to influenza is essential to inhibit early viral replication and guide
the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Using young adult (3 months) and
aged adult mice infected with mouse adapted H1N1 or H3N2, the results of our
study illustrate dysregulated and/or diminished activation of key signaling
pathways in aged lung contribute to increased lung inflammation and morbidity.
Specifically, within the first seven days of infection, there were significant
changes in genes associated with TLR and RIG-I signaling detected in aged murine 
lung in response to H1N1 or H3N2. Taken together, the results of our study expand
our current understanding of age-associated changes in antiviral signaling in the
lung.
