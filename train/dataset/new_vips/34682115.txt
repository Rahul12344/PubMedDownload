BACKGROUND: We set out to assess the risk factors for asthma outcome in a cohort 
of infants who experienced their first episode of acute bronchiolitis.
METHODS: A cohort of 222 infants who were included during a first episode of
acute bronchiolitis was prospectively followed. Herein, we present the results of
their assessments (symptom history, skin prick tests, specific IgE assay,
respiratory function tests) at age seven.
RESULTS: Of the 68/222 (30.6%) children assessed at age seven, 15 (22.05%)
presented with asthma and were mainly males (p = 0.033), 14 (20%) had respiratory
allergies, 17 (25%) presented atopic dermatitis and none had a food allergy.
Family history of atopy was associated with asthma and sensitisation to
aeroallergens at age seven (p = 0.003, p = 0.007). Rhinovirus (hRV) infection and
rhinovirus/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) co-infection were significantly
associated with asthma at age seven (p = 0.035, p = 0.04), but not with the
initial severity of bronchiolitis. Eosinophil counts at ages three and seven were
significantly higher in the asthmatics (p = 0.01, p = 0.046).
CONCLUSION: Any infant, especially male, presenting a first episode of acute
bronchiolitis due to hRV with a family history of atopy should be closely
monitored via follow-up due to a higher risk for asthma at school age.
