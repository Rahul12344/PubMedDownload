Genetic variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
have repeatedly altered the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Delta variants of concern are now the focus of intense international
attention because they are causing widespread COVID-19 globally and are
associated with vaccine breakthrough cases. We sequenced 16,965 SARS-CoV-2
genomes from samples acquired March 15, 2021, through September 20, 2021, in the 
Houston Methodist hospital system. This sample represents 91% of all Methodist
system COVID-19 patients during the study period. Delta variants increased
rapidly from late April onward to cause 99.9% of all COVID-19 cases and spread
throughout the Houston metroplex. Compared with all other variants combined,
Delta caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases (23.7% for
Delta compared with 6.6% for all other variants combined). Importantly,
significantly fewer fully vaccinated individuals required hospitalization.
Individuals with vaccine breakthrough cases caused by Delta had a low median PCR 
cycle threshold value (a proxy for high virus load). This value was closely
similar to the median cycle threshold value for unvaccinated patients with
COVID-19 caused by Delta variants, suggesting that fully vaccinated individuals
can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Patients infected with Alpha and Delta
variants had several significant differences. Our integrated analysis emphasizes 
that vaccines used in the United States are highly effective in decreasing severe
COVID-19, hospitalizations, and deaths.
