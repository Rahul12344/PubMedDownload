Genomic epidemiology is a core component in investigating the spread of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, the 
efficacy of control strategies in South Korea was evaluated using genomic
epidemiology based on viral genome sequences of 2,065 SARS-CoV-2 cases identified
in South Korea from January 2020 to December 2020. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the majority of viruses introduced from inbound travelers did not further
spread throughout South Korea; however, four distinct subgroups (KR.1-4,
belonging to B.1.497, B.1, K.1 and B.41) of viruses caused local epidemics. After
the introduction of enhanced social distancing, the viral population size and
daily case numbers decreased, and KR.2-4 subgroups were extinguished from South
Korea. Nevertheless, there was a subsequent increase in KR.1 subgroups after the 
downgrading of social distancing level. These results indicate that the
international traveler quarantine system implemented in South Korea along with
social distancing measures efficiently reduced the introduction and spread of
SARS-CoV-2, but it was not completely controlled. An improvement of control
strategies will be required to better control SARS-CoV-2, its variants, and
future pandemic viruses.
