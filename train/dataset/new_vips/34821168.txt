Adolescents living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (ALHIV) globally,
report worse treatment outcomes compared to adults and children on antiretroviral
therapy (ART). We conducted a photovoice study with eighteen ALHIV to explore
experiences and challenges of being on ART, and individual interviews with 5
health workers to describe the challenges in treating ALHIV. The facility
implemented the Family club intervention to facilitate caregivers
(parent/guardians) supporting ALHIV on treatment. The health workers revealed
that "disclosing HIV status" to children was the biggest challenge for caregivers
and health workers. Participating ALHIV reported that family support and having a
positive mentality were instrumental for continued treatment adherence. However, 
disclosure of HIV status to friends remained a challenge due to pervasive
community stigma. Treatment fatigue and side-effects were also barriers to
adherence. Family support was instrumental in facilitating adherence support for 
ALHIV. However, this (intervention) should include peer support to improve
positive mental well-being in ALHIV.
