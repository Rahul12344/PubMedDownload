In this study, we propose a time-dependent susceptible-unidentified
infected-confirmed (tSUC) epidemic mathematical model for the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which has a time-dependent transmission parameter. Using the tSUC model with real
confirmed data, we can estimate the number of unidentified infected cases. We can
perform a long-time epidemic analysis from the beginning to the current pandemic 
of COVID-19 using the time-dependent parameter. To verify the performance of the 
proposed model, we present several numerical experiments. The computational test 
results confirm the usefulness of the proposed model in the analysis of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
