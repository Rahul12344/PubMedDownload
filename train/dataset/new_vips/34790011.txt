Chronic viral hepatitis is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis worldwide.
Chronic hepatitis B is more common in the Asia-Pacific region due to the larger
population and lower screening availability. Hepatitis C predominates in the west
due to injection drug abuse. The discovery of (oral) direct-acting antiviral
agents (DAAs) has changed the landscape of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) management. 
Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) have also changed the approach to the treatment of
chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Oral NUCs and DAAs have excellent efficacy and patient
acceptance as well as a lower risk of resistance. However, certain populations
have no robust data and safety and efficacy of such oral drugs is still evolving.
In this review, we provide an overview of the management of CHB and CHC in
special populations, such as those with chronic kidney disease, pregnant women,
healthcare workers, and those undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy.
