CD8+ T cells responding to chronic infection adapt an altered differentiation
program that provides some restraint on pathogen replication yet limits
immunopathology. This adaptation is imprinted in stem-like cells and propagated
to their progeny. Understanding the molecular control of CD8+ T cell
differentiation in chronic infection has important therapeutic implications.
Here, we find that the chemokine receptor CXCR3 is highly expressed on
viral-specific stem-like CD8+ T cells and that one of its ligands, CXCL10,
regulates the persistence and heterogeneity of responding CD8+ T cells in spleens
of mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. CXCL10 is
produced by inflammatory monocytes and fibroblasts of the splenic red pulp, where
it grants stem-like cells access to signals promoting differentiation and limits 
their exposure to pro-survival niches in the white pulp. Consequently, functional
CD8+ T cell responses are greater in Cxcl10-/- mice and are associated with a
lower viral set point.
