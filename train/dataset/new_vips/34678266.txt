OBJECTIVES: During the last quarter of 2020-despite improved distribution of
personal protective equipment (PPE) and knowledge of COVID-19 management-nursing 
homes experienced the greatest increases in cases and deaths since the pandemic's
beginning. We sought to update COVID-19 estimates of cases, hospitalization, and 
mortality and to evaluate the association of potentially modifiable
facility-level infection control factors on odds and magnitude of COVID-19 cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths in nursing homes during the third surge of the
pandemic.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Facility-level data from 13,156 US nursing home
facilities.
METHODS: Two series of multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear
models to examine the association of infection control factors (personal
protective equipment and staffing) on incidence and magnitude, respectively, of
confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in nursing home residents 
reported in the last quarter of 2020.
RESULTS: Nursing homes experienced steep increases in COVID-19 cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths during the final quarter of 2020. Four-fifths
(80.51%; n = 10,592) of facilities reported at least 1 COVID-19 case, 49.44% (n =
6504) reported at least 1 hospitalization, and 49.76% (n = 6546) reported at
least 1 death during this third surge. N95 mask shortages were associated with
increased odds of at least 1 COVID-19 case [odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.05-1.40] and hospitalization (1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.40), as well as
larger numbers of hospitalizations (1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20). Nursing aide
shortages were associated with lower odds of at least 1 COVID-19 death (1.23, 95%
CI 1.12-1.34) and higher hospitalizations (1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.17). The number of
nursing hours per resident per day was largely insignificant across all outcomes.
Of note, smaller (<50-bed) and midsized (50- to 150-bed) facilities had lower
odds yet higher magnitude of all COVID outcomes. Bed occupancy rates >75%
increased odds of experiencing a COVID-19 case (1.48, 95% CI 1.35-1.62) or death 
(1.25, 95% CI 1.17-1.34).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Adequate staffing and PPE-along with reduced
occupancy and smaller facilities-mitigate incidence and magnitude of COVID-19
cases and sequelae. Addressing shortcomings in these factors is critical to the
prevention of infections and adverse health consequences of a next surge among
vulnerable nursing home residents.
