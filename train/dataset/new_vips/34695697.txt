PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the prevalence of high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV
types in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and
healthy controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary
care hospital on the patients of CRSwNP undergoing surgical management. All
patients underwent preoperative endoscopic evaluation and radiological assessment
using NCCT of the nose and paranasal sinuses. The severity of the disease was
graded using the Lund-Mackay score on NCCT. All patients underwent endoscopic
polypectomy and the sample of tissues was sent for HPV DNA detection using Hybrid
Capture II® technique. The clinicopathological characteristics of HPV positive
and negative patients were compared.
RESULTS: Sixty cases and 20 controls were included in the study. All controls
were negative for HPV DNA. 27 patients (45%) had the presence of HPV DNA, out of 
which 23 had only LR-HPV and 1 had only HR-HPV types. Three patients had both
HR-HPV and LR-HPV subtypes. There was a significant difference between the cases 
and controls for the presence of HPV DNA (p < 0.001). However, the patients with 
HPV-positive DNA in the nasal specimen did not differ significantly from
HPV-negative patients in age, gender, or severity of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomaviruses may play a significant role in the
etiopathogenesis of CRSwNP, however, do not impact the degree of sinus
involvement.
