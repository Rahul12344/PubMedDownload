Recent studies have identified high rates of chronic disease in Hawai'i's adults 
and youth. As the state responds to the COVID-19 pandemic and looks beyond it,
the prevention and management of chronic diseases are critical for community
health and wellbeing. Low health literacy is more common in rural populations,
Filipinos, and Pacific Islanders in Hawai'I, older adults, and many other groups 
with high rates of chronic disease. Promoting health literacy can reduce chronic 
disease burdens for individuals, families, and communities. Using the framework
of the social-ecological model, which is important for visioning effective
chronic disease management and prevention, this article provides a blueprint of
layers of influence for building a health literate Hawai'I generally and around
chronic disease specifically. The article will close with a call to action
informed by the National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy for stakeholders 
and providers to address health literacy in the state of Hawai'I in
organizations, systems, and policy. These actions should address root causes of
disease and help build more equitable health outcomes across the state now and in
the future.
