BACKGROUND: Liver disease has emerged as a leading cause of death among PLHIV
coinfected with HCV.
METHODS: A retrospective study involving all HCV viremic patients coinfected with
HIV who presented to HCV/HIV multidisciplinary clinics located at Embaba fever
hospital. Patients were assigned to receive DAAs according to the national
treatment guidelines. The primary endpoint was SVR12.
RESULTS: Of the 519 patients enrolled, 38.73% LTFU; either not initiated
(n = 170) or did not complete the treatment (n = 31). The main identified reasons
behind LTFU were schedule conflict (19%) or hospitalization (13%). Among 318
patients who completed their DAAs course, nine patients had a relapse after the
end of treatment and 97% had attained SVR12. There were significant differences
among different virological response groups in baseline factors including smoking
(p = 0.005), history of dental procedure (p = 0.007), CD4 count (p = 0.007), and 
HIV viral load (p = <0.001). Among responders (n = 309), there was a significant 
reduction of baseline hemoglobin and significant improvement of baseline
platelets (p = 0.005) at on-treatment week 8. Baseline necro-inflammatory markers
showed significant improvement across follow-up time points (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: DAAs are an effective and safe choice to treat HCV in PLHIV. Social 
stigma could be a major cause for lacking adherence to follow-up
visits.Abbreviations: ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase; ARV: Antiretroviral
