We describe the impact of changing epidemiology and vaccine introduction on
characteristics of COVID-19 outbreaks in 330 long-term care facilities (LTCF) in 
England between November 2020 and June 2021. As vaccine coverage in LTCF
increased and national incidence declined, the total number of outbreaks and
outbreak severity decreased across the LTCF. The number of infected cases per
outbreak decreased by 80.6%, while the proportion of outbreaks affecting staff
only increased. Our study supports findings of vaccine effectiveness in LTCF.
