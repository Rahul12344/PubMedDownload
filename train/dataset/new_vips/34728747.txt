Epidemiological efforts to model the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes 
COVID-19, are crucial to understanding and containing current and future
outbreaks and to inform public health responses. Mutations that occur in viral
genomes can alter virulence during outbreaks by increasing infection rates and
helping the virus evade the host immune system. To understand the changes in
viral genomic diversity and molecular epidemiology in Oxford during the first
wave of infections in the United Kingdom, we analyzed 563 clinical SARS-CoV-2
samples via whole-genome sequencing using Nanopore MinION sequencing. Large-scale
surveillance efforts during viral epidemics are likely to be confounded by the
number of independent introductions of the viral strains into a region. To avoid 
such issues and better understand the selection-based changes occurring in the
SARS-CoV-2 genome, we utilized local isolates collected during the UK's first
national lockdown whereby personal interactions, international and national
travel were considerably restricted and controlled. We were able to track the
short-term evolution of the virus, detect the emergence of several mutations of
concern or interest, and capture the viral diversity of the region. Overall,
these results demonstrate genomic pathogen surveillance efforts have considerable
utility in controlling the local spread of the virus.
