Porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection is a major disease in swine. It is
challenging to eradicate the virus entirely after it has invaded Chinese farms,
resulting in significant economic losses. This study aimed to explore the
histopathological correlation of brain regions in PRV-infected pigs. Twenty pigs 
were randomly divided into two experimental groups (the PRV-infected and
sham-inoculated groups; n = 10 per group). The pigs were then observed for
clinical signs at specified time points. Brain tissue samples were collected for 
histopathological examination on days 3, 10, and 14. The correlation analysis was
based on clinical observation, lesion characterization, and pathogen location.
Clinical observation showed that the severity of clinical neurological signs
increased with time. Pathological dissection and microscopic observation revealed
gross pathological changes such as degeneration and necrosis of nerve cells,
increase in microglia, eosinophilic inclusion body, lymphocyte infiltration, and 
loose cortical tissue structure. Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was
mainly localized in neurons, microglia, nerve fibers, cerebellar granular layer, 
and Purkinje cell layer. The virus invasion route was from the cerebrum to the
cerebellum and eventually to the brainstem, and the severity of brain damage
increased with time. The route of virus infection was from the olfactory bulb to 
the hippocampus and eventually to the medulla oblongata, and the viral expression
increased with time. Of note, brain injury, viral expression, and clinical
neurological signs were positively correlated with the infection period;
similarly, the severity and degrees of their changes were positively correlated.
