INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmaceutical interventions that have been implemented in
southern hemisphere countries because of COVID-19 pandemic declaration in March
2020, have evidenced some unexpected changes in the way of spreading of many
other viruses. This study as a part of ECEALHBA's Project, reports the
consequences of COVID-19 pandemic over 2020-2021 bronchiolitis epidemic period in
the Central and Eastern regions of Spain.
METHOD: Multicenter, observational, descriptive and ambispective study of
admitted infants with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis in 16 Spanish hospitals
involved in the investigation project. Five epidemic periods previous to COVID-19
pandemic, from 2015 to 2020, were compared with the current one, 2020-2021, in
both a qualitative and quantitative manner.
RESULTS: Total of 4643 infants were admitted to the participating hospitals along
the study period. Pandemic season hospital admissions for bronchiolitis were
94.1% lower than in pre-pandemic period. December and January were peak months
for bronchiolitis admissions during pre-pandemic period, but September was the
peak month during pandemic year. There was a progressive decrease of admissions
from this moment until the end of the follow-up, in April 2021. Rhinovirus has
been the commonest etiology for bronchiolitis in 2020-2021 epidemic period of
bronchiolitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Some of the non-pharmaceutical interventions initiated because of
COVID-19 pandemic are probably related to the dramatic decrease of bronchiolitis 
cases in 2020-2021 season. It would be rewarding to purpose novel research to
clarify how these simple interventions can be useful, close to vaccines and
antiviral drugs, to achieve the goal of avoiding the spread of respiratory
viruses in pediatric population.
