BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disorder of amino acid
metabolism, the treatment of which often requires a special diet to prevent
adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes. In the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a
substantial effect on the whole world since the beginning of 2020, PKU patients
represent a vulnerable population because they may be dependent on special
nutritional products, have limited access to routine care and display increased
levels of anxiety.
METHODS: For this reason, an online questionnaire assessing the anxiety levels
and various personal opinions and practices regarding the pandemic was sent to
the PKU patients managed at our clinic, who were 12 years of age or older.
Ninety-eight patients responded to the questionnaire. Median age of the
participants was 19 years.
RESULTS: Most patients were compliant with the hygiene and social distancing
recommendations regarding the spread of COVID-19. Of the patients, 61.2% felt
more anxious since the pandemic. The most common concern was the possibility of
not being able to obtain special nutritional products (58.2%). Anxiety level was 
significantly higher in females.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that food security is an important issue of
concern in PKU patients. In line with the changing world after the pandemic,
different strategies should be considered in the management of patients with
inborn errors of metabolism, including PKU.
