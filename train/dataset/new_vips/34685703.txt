IQSEC2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ADP-ribosylation factor 
6 (Arf6), of which protein is exclusively localized to the postsynaptic density
of the excitatory synapse. Human genome studies have revealed that the IQSEC2
gene is associated with X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and autism. In this study, we examined
the behavior and synapse function in IQSEC2 knockout (KO) mice that we generated 
using CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to solve the relevance between IQSEC2
deficiency and the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. IQSEC2 KO
mice exhibited autistic behaviors, such as overgrooming and social deficits. We
identified that up-regulation of c-Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) induced by social stimulation was significantly attenuated in IQSEC2 KO
mice. Whole cell electrophysiological recording identified that synaptic
transmissions mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
receptor (AMPAR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), and γ-aminobutyric acid 
receptor (GABAR) were significantly decreased in pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of 
the mPFC in IQSEC2 KO mice. Reexpression of IQSEC2 isoform 1 in the mPFC of
IQSEC2 KO mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV) rescued both synaptic and
social deficits, suggesting that impaired synaptic function in the mPFC is
responsible for social deficits in IQSEC2 KO mice.
