BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 patients mostly present with
respiratory symptoms; however, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations can also be
seen either alone or along with respiratory symptoms. We aimed to evaluate the GI
symptoms related to COVID-19.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study retrospectively evaluated the medical files
of 507 patients with confirmed or highly probable COVID-19. Based on their
symptoms, patients were categorized into four groups: with GI symptoms alone
(GIA), with respiratory symptoms alone (RA), with both GI and respiratory
symptoms (GIR), and without GI or respiratory symptoms (WGIR).
RESULTS: Of the 507 COVID-19 patients, 47.9% had at least one GI symptom; the
most common was nausea and/or vomiting (31.6%). Patients in the GIA group were
significantly older than those in the RA (P = 0.041) and GRI (P = 0.004) groups
(54.70 ± 18.14 vs. 48.68 ± 14.67 and 46.80 ± 17.17 years, respectively). Groups
were homogeneous with respect to gender. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were both
less frequent in patients with GI symptoms compared to those without GI symptoms.
Positive RT-PCR was significantly less frequent among patients with GI symptoms
(44% vs. 100%, P < 0.001). Although mortality was lower in patients with GI
symptoms (9.1%) in comparison with those without GI symptoms (13.3%), the
difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.134).
CONCLUSION: The typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are quite commonly
accompanied by GI symptoms, with nausea and/or vomiting being the most prevalent.
A subgroup of COVID-19 patients may exclusively present with GI symptoms. Special
attention should be paid to these patients in order to avoid misdiagnosis or
delayed treatment.
