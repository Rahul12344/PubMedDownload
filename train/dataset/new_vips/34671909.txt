Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) is an important soil-borne virus of potato that is
transmitted by stubby-root nematodes. TRV causes corky ringspot, a tuber disease 
of economic importance to potato production. Utilizing protein-coding regions of 
the whole genome and a range of computational tools, the genetic diversity, and
population structure of TRV isolates from several potato-growing regions
(Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Washington
State) in the USA were determined. Phylogenetic analyses based on RNA2 nucleotide
sequences, the coat protein (CP) and nematode transmission (2b) genes, showed
geographical clustering of USA isolates with previously known American isolates, 
while European isolates grouped in a distinct cluster. This was corroborated by
the observed genetic differentiation and infrequent gene flow between American
and European isolates. Low genetic diversity was revealed among American isolates
compared to European isolates. Phylogenetic clustering based on RNA1 genes (RdRp,
RdRp-RT, and 1a) were all largely incongruent to that of 1b gene (virus
suppressor of RNA silencing). This genetic incongruence suggested the influence
of recombination. Furthermore, the RdRp, RdRp-RT, and 1a genes were predicted to 
be more conserved and under negative selection, while the 1b gene was less
constrained. Different evolutionary lineages between TRV RNA1 and RNA2 genomic
segments were revealed.
