BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus has a high mortality rate (over 1% for patients
older than 50). This could be only partially ascribed to other comorbidities.
Possible explanation could be something which assures the ability to prompt
response to SARS-CoV-2 in younger people independently from the novelty of the
virus itself. Something stimulated the immune system and it scattered immunity
against more antigens. The only external stimulation, which healthy people
receive, is vaccination (i.e. diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine). 
One hypothesis is that vaccination develops the specific immunity but generates a
sprouting immunity against antigens in transit. The underlying immunological
phenomena are "bystander effect" and "trained immunity". The developed immunity
gives protection for years until the natural fade out. After the fifth decade a
viral infection will find immune system almost incompetent and the novel
coronavirus bursts into the body, developing an ARDS.
OBJECTIVE: The first study's aim is to demonstrate that blood monocytes and NK
cells show an overpowering hyperactivity, while CD4+ and CD8+ T cells experience 
an impediment to their defensive functions, in patients with severe infection to 
SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objectives are to correlate clinical data and
vaccination history with laboratory immune pattern, to identify protective
factors. Subsequently, we were also interested in characterizing the phenotype
and state of degree of activation within peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), of monocytes, NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in healthy subjects
vaccinated with Pfizer.
METHODS: Data will be collected using 3 approaches: An experimental analysis to
study the innate immune response and to identify the genetic profiles; An
epidemiological analysis to identify the patients' vaccination history; A
clinical analysis to detect the immunological profile.
RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on 16 April 2020 and
the study started on 27 April 2020. As of February 2021 enrollment was completed.
Immunological analysis is going on and we expect to complete this analysis by
December 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: We suppose to recognize different populations of patients, each one 
with a specific immunological pattern in terms of cytokines, soluble factors
serum level and immune cells activity. Anamnestic data such as preceding
vaccinations and comorbidities, biochemical data findings as lymphocyte
immunophenotyping and pre-existing persistent cytomegalovirus infection allow
depicting the risk profile of severe COVID-19. The proof of a role of these
immunological phenomena on the development of COVID-19 are bases for
implementation of therapeutic immunomodulatory treatments.
CLINICALTRIAL: The protocol is available on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, its
identifier is NCT04375176
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04375176?term=NCT04375176&draw=2&rank=1).
