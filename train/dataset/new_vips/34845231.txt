Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, the
COVID-19 pandemic has hindered social life and global economic activity. As of
July 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused over four million deaths. The rapid spread and
high mortality of the disease demanded the international scientific community to 
develop effective vaccines in a matter of months. However, unease about vaccine
efficacy has arisen with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs).
Time- and cost-efficient in vitro neutralization assays are widely used to
measure neutralizing antibody responses against VOCs. However, the extent to
which in vitro neutralization reflects protection from infection remains unclear.
Here, we describe common neutralization assays based on infectious and
pseudotyped viruses and evaluate their role in testing neutralizing responses
against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, we briefly review the recent
findings on the immune response elicited by available vaccines against major
SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.
