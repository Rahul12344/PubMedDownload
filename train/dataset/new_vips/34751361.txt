The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a number of ethical issues that typically
have not been addressed openly in public debate. The argument 'protect the
vulnerable' has been a mantra to motivate all sorts of measures, many of them not
scientifically motivated. In this article, the concept of 'vulnerability' is
analyzed, and a model is suggested to distinguish layers of vulnerability that
may or may not result in poor outcomes, depending on how many layers are present 
and how they interact. Ethical aspects also need to be considered at the global
level, where the issue of vaccine distribution illustrates that stronger
obligations and responsibilities need to be taken to fulfil wishes and
declarations on the fair distribution of resources.
