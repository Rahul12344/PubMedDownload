Cellular and virus-coded long non-coding (lnc) RNAs support multiple roles
related to biological and pathological processes. Several lncRNAs sequester their
3' termini to evade cellular degradation machinery, thereby supporting disease
progression. An intramolecular triplex involving the lncRNA 3' terminus, the
element for nuclear expression (ENE), stabilizes RNA transcripts and promotes
persistent function. Therefore, such ENE triplexes, as presented here in Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) lncRNA,
represent targets for therapeutic development. Towards identifying novel ligands 
targeting the PAN ENE triplex, we screened a library of immobilized small
molecules and identified several triplex-binding chemotypes, the tightest of
which exhibits micromolar binding affinity. Combined biophysical, biochemical,
and computational strategies localized ligand binding to a platform created near 
a dinucleotide bulge at the base of the triplex. Crystal structures of apo (3.3
Å) and ligand-soaked (2.5 Å) ENE triplexes, which include a stabilizing basal
duplex, indicate significant local structural rearrangements within this
dinucleotide bulge. MD simulations and a modified nucleoside analog interference 
technique corroborate the role of the bulge and the base of the triplex in ligand
binding. Together with recently discovered small molecules that reduce nuclear
MALAT1 lncRNA levels by engaging its ENE triplex, our data supports the potential
of targeting RNA triplexes with small molecules.
