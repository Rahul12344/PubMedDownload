Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The latest data show that more than
211.7 million people were infected and more than 4.4 million deaths have been
reported. The illness presents a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to
severe. Mild symptoms include cough, fever, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia and
arthralgia, anosmia, and dysgeusia. Furthermore, this virus can affect the
central nervous system (CNS) and present a range of mild to severe nervous
symptoms, from headache and dysphoria to loss of consciousness, coma, paralysis, 
and acute cerebrovascular disease. The virus can enter nonneuronal cells of the
olfactory epithelium and cause a complete loss of smell. Anosmia and hyposmia are
commonly reported in clinics, and being asymptomatic or showing mild symptoms can
be primary symptoms in early infected persons. Dysgeusia/hypogeusia is another
symptom presented with anosmia/hyposmia. In this article, we reviewed the
articles of anosmia and suggested a possible mechanism for this.
