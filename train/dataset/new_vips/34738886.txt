Nyamiviridae is a family of viruses in the order Mononegavirales, with
unsegmented (except for members of the genus Tapwovirus), negative-sense RNA
genomes of 10-13 kb. Nyamviruses have a genome organisation and content similar
to that of other mononegaviruses. Nyamiviridae includes several genera that form 
monophyletic clades on phylogenetic analysis of the RNA polymerase. Nyamiviruses 
have been found associated with diverse invertebrates as well as land- and
seabirds. Members of the genera Nyavirus and Socyvirus produce enveloped,
spherical virions. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses (ICTV) Report on the family Nyamiviridae, which is available at
ictv.global/report/nyamiviridae.
