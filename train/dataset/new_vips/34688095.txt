This article considers current trends in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research 
and knowledge gaps relevant to policymaking in the water sector. Specifically,
biological indicators of AMR (antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their resistance 
genes) and detection methods that have been used so far are identified and
discussed, as well as the problems with and solutions to the collection of AMR
data, sewage surveillance lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the financial
burden caused by AMR, which could be synergically used to improve advocacy on AMR
issues in the water sector. Finally, this article proposes solutions to
overcoming existing hurdles and shortening the time it will take to have an
impact on policymaking and regulation in the sector.
