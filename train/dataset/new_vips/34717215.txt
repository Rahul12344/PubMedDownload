Hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) was discovered in the sera of HBV
patients nearly 50 years ago. It is not essential for HBV to infect or replicate 
in hepatocytes. Earlier clinical studies suggested that this antigen might play
an important role for HBV to establish persistence in babies after its
mother-to-child transmission. Subsequent clinical studies also suggested that
HBeAg might have immunomodulatory activities. In recent years, a large body of
information on how HBeAg might modulate host immunity was published. In this
review, we summarize recent research progresses on the immunomodulatory
activities of HBeAg and discuss how these activities of HBeAg may promote HBV
persistence.
