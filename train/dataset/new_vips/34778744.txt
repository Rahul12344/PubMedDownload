The speed at which several COVID-19 vaccines went from conception to receiving
FDA and EMA approval for emergency use is an achievement unrivaled in the history
of vaccine development. Mass vaccination efforts using the highly effective
vaccines are currently underway to generate sufficient herd immunity and reduce
transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite the most advanced vaccine
technology, global recipient coverage, especially in resource-poor areas remains 
a challenge as genetic drift in naïve population pockets threatens overall
vaccine efficacy. In this study, we described the production of insect-cell
expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain constructs and examined their
immunogenicity in mice. We demonstrated that, when formulated with CoVaccine HTTM
adjuvant, an oil-in-water nanoemulsion compatible with lyophilization, our
vaccine candidates elicit a broad-spectrum IgG response, high neutralizing
antibody (NtAb) titers against SARS-CoV-2 prototype and variants of concern,
specifically B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1. (Gamma), and an antigen-specific IFN-γ
secreting response in outbred mice. Of note, different ectodomain constructs
yielded variations in NtAb titers against the prototype strain and some VOC. Dose
response experiments indicated that NtAb titers increased with antigen dose, but 
not adjuvant dose, and may be higher with a lower adjuvant dose. Our findings lay
the immunological foundation for the development of a dry-thermostabilized
vaccine that is deployable without refrigeration.
