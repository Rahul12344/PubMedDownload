BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the long-term health effects of
child survivors of the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak.
Here, we assess post-Ebola sequelae among EVD child survivors by comparing the
self-reported symptoms between EVD child survivors and their close household
contacts over one year after the end of the outbreak.
METHODS: EVD child survivors(n=159) and their close contacts(n=303) were enrolled
in Western and Eastern Sierra Leone. Demographics and self-reported symptoms data
were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. We compared a
list of self-reported symptoms between EVD child survivors and their close
household contacts using backward stepwise logistic regression.
RESULTS: EVD child survivors were more likely to be orphans compared to their
close contacts. Musculoskeletal, ocular, auditory and neurological symptoms were 
more prevalent among Ebola child survivors than their close contacts (p<0.001).
Joint pain and headache were the most common self-reported symptoms in EVD child 
survivors and their close contacts. Joint pain (AOR=2.633; 95 % CI:1.31-5.28,
p=0.006), eye pain (AOR=4.56;95 %CI: 2.16-9.64, p<0.001), hearing loss (AOR=3.85;
95 %CI: 1.15-12.87, p=0.029), memory impairment (AOR=7.76;0.95 %CI: 1.34-45.01
p=0.022), mood changes (AOR=5.07; 95 %CI: 2.35-10.94, p<0.001) were more common
among survivors than their contacts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that EVD child survivors have higher odds than
their close contacts of suffering from musculoskeletal, ophthalmic, auditory and 
neurological impairment more than a year after the end of the EVD outbreak.
Routine screening, treatment and monitoring of these symptoms is required to
prevent long-term disability among EVD child survivors.
