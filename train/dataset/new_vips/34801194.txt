The many socioeconomic disparities in the myriad of diagnoses that make up benign
lung diseases are unfortunately a global issue that was most recently highlighted
by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. In this chapter, we will be reviewing the
socioeconomic disparities in benign lung disease from both a United States
perspective as well as a global perspective. We will cover the spectrum of
infectious, obstructive, and restrictive lung disease and review the evidence on 
how social disparities affect these populations and their access to medical care.
