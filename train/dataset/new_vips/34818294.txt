During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers experienced much higher
symptoms of anxiety or depression than during the prepandemic period. As coping
mechanisms, high resilience, spirituality, and satisfaction with family
functioning were associated with 2- to 3-fold lower odds of anxiety or
depression. Health care organizations may consider implementing evidence-based
and practical supportive measures to help health care workers maintain good
mental health during and after the pandemic.
