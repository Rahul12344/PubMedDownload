BACKGROUND: Due to their health condition, patients with neuromuscular diseases
(NMD) are at greater risk of developing serious complications with COVID-19. The 
objective of this study was to analyze the prevalence of COVID-19 among NMD
patients and the risk factors for its impact and severity during the first wave
of the pandemic. Clinical data were collected from NMD-COVID-19 patients, between
March 25, 2020 and May 11, 2020 in an anonymous survey carried out by expert
physicians from the French Health Care Network Filnemus.
RESULTS: Physicians reported 84 patients, including: 34 with myasthenia gravis,
27 with myopathy and 23 with neuropathy. COVID-19 had no effect on NMD for 48
(58%) patients and 48 (58%) patients developed low COVID-19 severity. COVID-19
caused the death of 9 (11%) NMD patients. Diabetic patients were at greater risk 
of dying. Patients with diabetes, hypertension or severe forms of NMD had a
higher risk of developing a moderate or severe form of COVID-19. In our cohort,
corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants were not significantly associated
with higher COVID-19 severity for acquired NMD.
CONCLUSION: During this period, a small percentage of French NMD patients was
affected by COVID-19 compared to the general French population and COVID-19 had a
limited short-term effect on them. Diabetes, hypertension and a severe degree of 
NMD were identified as risk factors of unfavorable outcome following COVID-19.
Conversely, in our cohort of patients with acquired NMD, corticosteroids or other
immunosuppressants did not appear to be risk factors for more severe COVID-19.
