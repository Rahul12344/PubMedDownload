Aim      To study the effect of regular drug therapy for cardiovascular and other
diseases preceding the COVID-19 infection on severity and outcome of COVID-19
based on data of the ACTIVE (Analysis of dynamics of Comorbidities in paTIents
who surVived SARS-CoV-2 infEction) registry.Material and methods  The ACTIVE
registry was created at the initiative of the Eurasian Association of Therapists.
The registry includes 5 808 male and female patients diagnosed with COVID-19
treated in a hospital or at home with a due protection of patients' privacy (data
of nasal and throat smears; antibody titer; typical CT imaging features). The
register territory included 7 countries: the Russian Federation, the Republic of 
Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz
Republic, the Republic of Moldova, and the Republic of Uzbekistan. The registry
design: a closed, multicenter registry with two nonoverlapping arms (outpatient
arm and in-patient arm). The registry scheduled 6 visits, 3 in-person visits
during the acute period and 3 virtual visits (telephone calls) at 3, 6, and 12
mos. Patient enrollment started on June 29, 2020 and was completed on October 29,
2020. The registry completion is scheduled for October 29, 2022. The registry ID:
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04492384. In this fragment of the study of registry data, 
the work group analyzed the effect of therapy for comorbidities at baseline on
severity and outcomes of the novel coronavirus infection. The study population
included only the patients who took their medicines on a regular basis while the 
comparison population consisted of noncompliant patients (irregular drug intake
or not taking drugs at all despite indications for the treatment).Results The
analysis of the ACTIVE registry database included 5808 patients. The vast
majority of patients with COVID-19 had comorbidities with prevalence of
cardiovascular diseases. Medicines used for the treatment of COVID-19
comorbidities influenced the course of the infectious disease in different ways. 
A lower risk of fatal outcome was associated with the statin treatment in
patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD); with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor antagonists and with beta-blockers in
patients with IHD, arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), and atrial
fibrillation; with oral anticoagulants (OAC), primarily direct OAC,
clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor in patients with IHD; with oral
antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); and
with long-acting insulins in patients with type 1 DM. A higher risk of fatal
outcome was associated with the spironolactone treatment in patients with CHF and
with inhaled corticosteroids (iCS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD).Conclusion      In the epoch of COVID-19 pandemic, a lower risk of
severe course of the coronavirus infection was observed for patients with chronic
noninfectious comorbidities highly compliant with the base treatment of the
comorbidity.
