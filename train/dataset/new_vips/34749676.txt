BACKGROUND: A variety of public health measures have been implemented during the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Canada to reduce contact between individuals. The objective 
of this study was to provide empirical contact pattern data to evaluate the
impact of public health measures, the degree to which social contacts rebounded
to normal levels, as well as direct public health efforts toward age- and
location-specific settings.
METHODS: Four population-based cross-sectional surveys were administered to
members of a paid panel representative of Canadian adults by age, gender,
official language, and region of residence during May (Survey 1), July (Survey
2), September (Survey 3), and December (Survey 4) 2020. A total of 4981 (Survey
1), 2493 (Survey 2), 2495 (Survey 3), and 2491 (Survey 4) respondents provided
information about the age and setting for each direct contact made in a 24-h
period. Contact matrices were constructed and contacts for those under the age of
18 years imputed. The next generation matrix approach was used to estimate the
reproduction number (Rt) for each survey. Respondents with children under
18 years estimated the number of contacts their children made in school and
extracurricular settings.
RESULTS: Estimated Rt values were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.69) for May, 0.48 (95% CI:
0.29-0.68) for July, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63-1.52) for September, and 0.81 (0.47-1.17)
for December. The highest proportion of reported contacts occurred within the
home (51.3% in May), in 'other' locations (49.2% in July) and at work (66.3 and
65.4% in September and December). Respondents with children reported an average
of 22.7 (95% CI: 21.1-24.3) (September) and 19.0 (95% CI 17.7-20.4) (December)
contacts at school per day per child in attendance.
CONCLUSION: The skewed distribution of reported contacts toward workplace
settings in September and December combined with the number of reported
school-related contacts suggest that these settings represent important
opportunities for transmission emphasizing the need to support and ensure
infection control procedures in both workplaces and schools.
