OBJECTIVE: Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the coming months is a matter of great importance and
urgency for governments worldwide, making fundamental decisions based on what is 
known about the transmission mechanisms of the virus and its survival in the
environment. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of demographic
variables, solar radiation and relative humidity on the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic of the various regions in Italy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective longitudinal study was conducted, and
data used in this study was obtained from the Italian Health Ministry.
Descriptive statistics included mean, frequency, and percentage, and results
presented by graphs were calculated.
RESULTS: The infection trend was investigated by comparing it with the
demographic situation and the irradiation indices of solar ultraviolet light that
are detected with the changing seasons. The present study reported that the
geographic areas with higher population density and lower solar radiation during 
the autumn and winter months were most affected by SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis carried out can provide a predictive model for the
future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, regardless of the adoption of
lockdown measures and behavioral factors.
