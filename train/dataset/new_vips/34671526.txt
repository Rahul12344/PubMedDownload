Superficial mucoceles are benign, small, translucent vesicles occurring in any
part of the oral cavity, due to extravasation of saliva due to ruptured minor
salivary gland ducts. This distinct entity presents as single or multiple
asymptomatic vesicles. The etiology is unclear; however, these are not associated
with a history of trauma, unlike the conventional mucoceles. These lesions tend
to be recurrent and are occasionally associated with discomfort to the
patients. Since they clinically mimic various vesiculobullous lesions such as
pemphigoid, bullous lichen planus, or herpes virus infection, they are often
misdiagnosed. Asymptomatic superficial mucoceles or lesions in multiple locations
do not require treatment. Nevertheless, the treatment for lesions causing
discomfort includes surgical excision, cryosurgery, and carbon dioxide (CO2)
laser. This case report describes a rare presentation of superficial mucocele
along the midline of the hard palate in a 30-year-old male patient, which was
histopathologically confirmed post-surgical excision; the patient is currently
disease free with no recurrence for six months.
