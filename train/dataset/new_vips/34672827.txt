INTRODUCTION: We sought to describe how Latina immigrants living in King County
coped with the pandemic, including their attitudes and behaviors related to
COVID-19, and the impact of the pandemic on their mental health and wellbeing.
METHOD: We conducted surveys by phone with adult Spanish-speaking Latina
immigrants (n = 137) in the summer of 2020.
RESULTS: Very few women had been infected with COVID-19, and 23% reported having 
been tested. Most frequent reasons for not being tested were not knowing where to
go (14%), concerns over the cost (15%), and not wanting to know if they were
infected (12%). Most participants had concerns about paying for housing (76%) and
food (73%). Depression and anxiety symptoms were in the moderate range. Almost
all participants were practicing recommended preventive behaviors.
CONCLUSION: Although few participants had COVID-19 infection, the pandemic had
significant impacts on their mental health and ability to meet basic needs.
