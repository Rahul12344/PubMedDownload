Background: Although the serological antibody responses induced by SARS-CoV-2
vaccines are well characterized, little is known about their ability to elicit
mucosal immunity.
Objectives: This study aims to examine and compare the mucosal and systemic
responses of recipients of two different vaccination platforms: mRNA (Comirnaty) 
and inactivated virus (CoronaVac).
Methods: Serial blood and nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) samples were
collected from the recipients of either Comirnaty or CoronaVac. The plasma and
NELF immunoglobulins A and G (IgA and IgG) specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (S1)
and their neutralization effects were quantified.
Results: Comirnaty induced nasal S1-specific immunoglobulin responses, which were
evident as early as 14 ± 2 days after the first dose. In 64% of the subjects, the
neutralizing effects of NELF persisted for at least 50 days. Moreover, 85% of
Comirnaty recipients exhibited S1-specific IgA and IgG responses in plasma by 14 
± 2 days after the first dose. By 7 ± 2 days after the booster, all plasma
samples possessed S1-specific IgA and IgG responses and were neutralizing. The
induction of S1-specific plasma antibodies by CoronaVac was IgG dominant, and 83%
of the subjects possessed S1-specific IgG by 7 ± 2 days after the booster, with
neutralizing effects.
Conclusion: Comirnaty induces S1-specific IgA and IgG responses with neutralizing
activity in the nasal mucosa; a similar response is not seen with CoronaVac.
Clinical Implication: The presence of a nasal response with mRNA vaccine may
provide additional protection compared with inactivated virus vaccine. However,
whether such widespread immunological response may produce inadvertent adverse
effects in other tissues warrants further investigation.
