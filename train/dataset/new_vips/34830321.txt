Conformational conversion of the cellular isoform of prion protein, PrPC, into
the abnormally folded, amyloidogenic isoform, PrPSc, is an underlying pathogenic 
mechanism in prion diseases. The diseases manifest as sporadic, hereditary, and
acquired disorders. Etiological mechanisms driving the conversion of PrPC into
PrPSc are unknown in sporadic prion diseases, while prion infection and specific 
mutations in the PrP gene are known to cause the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in
acquired and hereditary prion diseases, respectively. We recently reported that a
neurotropic strain of influenza A virus (IAV) induced the conversion of PrPC into
PrPSc as well as formation of infectious prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells
after infection, suggesting the causative role of the neuronal infection of IAV
in sporadic prion diseases. Here, we discuss the conversion mechanism of PrPC
into PrPSc in different types of prion diseases, by presenting our findings of
the IAV infection-induced conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and by reviewing the so
far reported transgenic animal models of hereditary prion diseases and the
reverse genetic studies, which have revealed the structure-function relationship 
for PrPC to convert into PrPSc after prion infection.
