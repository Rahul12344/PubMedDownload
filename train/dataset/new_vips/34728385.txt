BACKGROUND: While measles vaccination is widely implemented in national
immunisation programmes, measles incidence rates are increasing worldwide. Dutch 
inhabitants who were born between 1965-1975 may have fallen between two stools,
lacking protection from a natural infection, and having missed the introduction
of the measles vaccination schedule. With this study we aim to find the measles
seroprevalence in travellers born between 1965 and 1975, compared to those born
before 1965 and after 1975.
METHODS: Families travelling to Eastern Europe or outside Europe during the
preceding year were recruited via Dutch secondary schools between 2016 and 2018. 
Their vaccination status was assessed using questionnaires, vaccination records
and measles serology in dried blood spot (DBS) eluates. Measles virus antibody
concentrations were determined with an ELISA (EUROIMMUNE®) and a subset was
retested with a focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNT).
RESULTS: In 188 (79%) of the 239 available DBS eluates, the ELISA could detect
sufficient measles virus-specific IgG antibodies. Of the negative samples that
were retested with FRNT, 85% remained negative, resulting in an overall
seroprevalence of 82% [95% CI 76-86]. Children had a lower seroprevalence (72%)
than adults (87%). Travellers born between 1965 and 1975 were protected in 89%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report a measles seroprevalence of 82% among Dutch
travelling families. Remarkably, seroprevalence rates were lowest in children
(12-18 years) instead of travellers born between 1965 and 1975. Although a
fraction of people without detectable antibodies may be protected by other immune
mechanisms, these data suggest that measles (re)vaccination should be considered 
for travellers to endemic regions.
