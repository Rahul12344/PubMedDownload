The recent emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has threatened the efforts to
contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of these "variants of concern" has
increased immune escape and has supplanted the ancestral strains. The novel
variants harbored by the B.1.617 lineage (kappa and delta) carry mutations within
the receptor-binding domain of spike (S) protein (L452R + E484Q and L452R +
T478K), the region binding to the host receptor. The double mutations carried by 
these novel variants are primarily responsible for an upsurge number of COVID-19 
cases in India. In this study, we thoroughly investigated the impact of these
double mutations on the binding capability to the human host receptor. We
performed several structural analyses and found that the studied double mutations
increase the binding affinity of the spike protein to the human host receptor
(ACE2). Furthermore, our study showed that these double mutants might be a
dominant contributor enhancing the receptor-binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and
consequently making it more stable. We also investigated the impact of these
mutations on the binding affinity of two monoclonal antibodies (Abs) (2-15 and
LY-CoV555) and found that the presence of the double mutations also hinders its
binding with the studied Abs. The principal component analysis, free energy
landscape, intermolecular interaction, and other investigations provided a deeper
structural insight to better understand the molecular mechanism responsible for
increased viral transmissibility of these variants.
