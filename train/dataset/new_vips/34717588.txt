BACKGROUND: Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of emerging infectious 
diseases is crucial for implementation of control measures. In the first 7 months
from the occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam has documented comparatively
few cases of COVID-19. Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of these
cases may contribute to development of global countermeasures.
METHODS: We assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 from 23 January 
to 31 July 2020 in Vietnam. Data were collected from reports of the World Health 
Organization, the Vietnam Ministry of Health, and related websites. Temporal
distribution was assessed via the transmission classification (local or
quarantined cases). Geographical distribution was assessed via the number of
cases in each province along with their timelines. The most likely disease
clusters with elevated incidence were assessed via calculation of the relative
risk (RR).
RESULTS: Among 544 observed cases of COVID-19, the median age was 35 years, 54.8%
were men, and 50.9% were diagnosed during quarantine. During the observation
period, there were four phases: Phase 1, COVID-19 cases occurred sporadically in 
January and February 2020; Phase 2, an epidemic wave occurred from the 1st week
of March to the middle of April (Wave 1); Phase 3, only quarantining cases were
involved; and Phase 4, a second epidemic wave began on July 25th, 2020 (Wave 2). 
A spatial cluster in Phase 1 was detected in Vinh Phuc Province (RR, 38.052). In 
Phase 2, primary spatial clusters were identified in the areas of Hanoi and Ha
Nam Province (RR, 6.357). In Phase 4, a spatial cluster was detected in Da Nang, 
a popular coastal tourist destination (RR, 70.401).
CONCLUSIONS: Spatial disease clustering of COVID-19 in Vietnam was associated
with large cities, tourist destinations, people's mobility, and the occurrence of
nosocomial infections. Past experiences with outbreaks of emerging infectious
diseases led to quick implementation of governmental countermeasures against
COVID-19 and a general acceptance of these measures by the population. The
behaviors of the population and the government, as well as the country's age
distribution, may have contributed to the low incidence and small number of
severe COVID-19 cases.
