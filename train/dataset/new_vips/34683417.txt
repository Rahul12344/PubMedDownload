Here, the virucidal effect of calcium bicarbonate with a mesoscopic structure
(CAC-717) on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was
determined. Assays showed that CAC-717 had a strong virucidal effect on all
examined SARS-CoV-2 isolates, including variant strains. The viral infectivity
decreased within 15 s, and the virucidal activity of CAC-717 at a 1:49 ratio was 
similar to that of ethanol disinfectant. CAC-717 neutralization eliminated this
virucidal effect, indicating that the alkaline condition of CAC-717 is important 
for virus inactivation and is an indicator of its mesoscopic structure and
virucidal activity. The virucidal effect was observed in the presence of organic 
matter (bovine serum albumin). CAC-717 is a non-invasive and non-flammable
substance with a low environmental burden, and its usefulness as a novel
disinfectant has been confirmed.
