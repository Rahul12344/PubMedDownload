Background: Bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are the most
common viral agents in neonatal calf diarrhea and result in serious economic
consequences. The aim of the study was to determine the epidemiology of those
viruses in randomly selected dairy farms of Addis Ababa.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2018 to April 2019
using a probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling technique. A total of 110
calves, less than 30 days of age, from 57 dairy herds were involved in the study.
Associated factors of herds and calves were collected using semistructured
interviews from farm owners and through physical observation of selected calves. 
Fecal samples were collected and analyzed using the sandwich ELISA method. Data
generated from both semistructured interviews and laboratory investigation were
analyzed using STATA_MP version 15.
Results: From the total 110 calves, 42 (38.18%) had diarrhea during the survey.
The prevalence of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus was 3.64% (4/110) and 0.91%
(1/110), respectively. Diarrhea, feeding colostrum timing, and sex of the
neonatal calves had statistically significant association with bovine rotavirus
infection (p < 0.05). All rotavirus-positive neonatal calves were identified in
small scale dairy farms and in dairy farms that reported mortality though they
lack statistically significant association. Only one coronavirus case was
detected among the neonatal calves. The case was identified among small scale
herds and in a herd with diarrheal cases. The sex of the coronavirus calf was
female, diarrheic, and among 11-20 days old.
Conclusion: The prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus infections in neonatal
calves was seldom in dairy farms of the study area. Rotavirus was more common
than coronavirus, and further studies should be initiated on other (infectious
and noninfectious) causes of neonatal calf diarrhea in the area.
