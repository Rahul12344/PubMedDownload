Infection by rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV) in children ranges from
asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). This
cohort study evaluates the clinical impact of RV/EV species, alone or in
codetection with other viruses, in young children with severe LRTI. Seventy-one
patients aged less than 5 years and admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care
Unit (PICU) of a reference children's hospital with RV or EV (RV/EV) LRTI were
prospectively included from 1/2018 to 3/2020. A commercial PCR assay for multiple
respiratory pathogens was performed in respiratory specimens. In 22/71, RV/EV +
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found, and 18/71 had RV/EV + multiple viral
detections. Patients with single RV/EV detection required invasive mechanical
ventilation (IMV) as frequently as those with RSV codetection, whereas none of
those with multiple viral codetections required IMV. Species were determined in
60 samples, 58 being RV. No EV-A, EV-C, or EV-D68 were detected. RV-B and EV-B
were only found in patients with other respiratory virus codetections. There were
not any associations between RV/EV species and severity outcomes. To conclude,
RV/EV detection alone was observed in young children with severe disease, while
multiple viral codetections may result in reduced clinical severity. Differences 
in pathogenicity between RV and EV species could not be drawn.
