INTRODUCTION: Famotidine is a competitive histamine H2-receptor antagonist most
commonly used for gastric acid suppression but thought to have potential efficacy
in treating patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aims of this
systematic review and meta-analysis are to summarize the current literature and
report clinical outcomes on the use of famotidine for treatment of hospitalized
patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: Five databases were searched through February 12, 2021 to identify
observational studies that reported on associations of famotidine use with
outcomes in COVID-19. Meta-analysis was conducted for composite primary clinical 
outcome (e.g. rate of death, intubation, or intensive care unit admissions) and
death separately, where either aggregate odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) was
calculated.
RESULTS: Four studies, reporting on 46,435 total patients and 3,110 patients
treated with famotidine, were included in this meta-analysis. There was no
significant association between famotidine use and composite outcomes in patients
with COVID-19: HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.16). Across the three studies that
reported mortality separated from other endpoints, there was no association
between famotidine use during hospitalization and risk of death-HR 0.67 (95% CI: 
0.26, 1.73) and OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.19, 3.34). Heterogeneity ranged from 83.69% to
88.07%.
CONCLUSION: Based on the existing observational studies, famotidine use is not
associated with a reduced risk of mortality or combined outcome of mortality,
intubation, and/or intensive care services in hospitalized individuals with
COVID-19, though heterogeneity was high, and point estimates suggested a possible
protective effect for the composite outcome that may not have been observed due
to lack of power. Further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may help determine 
the efficacy and safety of famotidine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients in
various care settings of the disease.
