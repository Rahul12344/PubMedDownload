X-linked MAGT1 deficiency with increased susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infection and N-linked glycosylation defect (XMEN) disease is an inborn
error of immunity caused by loss-of-function mutations in the magnesium
transporter 1 (MAGT1) gene. The original studies of XMEN patients focused on
impaired magnesium regulation, leading to decreased EBV-cytotoxicity and the loss
of surface expression of the activating receptor "natural killer group 2D"
(NKG2D) on CD8+ T cells and NK cells. In vitro studies showed that
supraphysiological supplementation of magnesium rescued these defects.
Observational studies in 2 patients suggested oral magnesium supplementation
could decrease EBV viremia. Hence, we performed a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover study in 2 parts. In part 1, patients received
either oral magnesium L-threonate (MLT) or placebo for 12 weeks followed by
12 weeks of the other treatment. Part 2 began with 3 days of high-dose
intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) followed by open-label MLT for
24 weeks. One EBV-infected and 3 EBV-naïve patients completed part 1. One
EBV-naïve patient was removed from part 2 of the study due to asymptomatic
elevation of liver enzymes during IV MgSO4. No change in EBV or NKG2D status was 
observed. In vitro magnesium supplementation experiments in cells from 14 XMEN
patients failed to significantly rescue NKG2D expression and the clinical trial
was stopped. Although small, this study indicates magnesium supplementation is
unlikely to be an effective therapeutic option in XMEN disease.
