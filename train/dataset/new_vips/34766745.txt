Antimicrobial coatings are one method to reduce the spread of microbial diseases.
Transparent coatings preserve the visual properties of surfaces and are strictly 
necessary for applications such as antimicrobial cell phone screens. This work
describes transparent coatings that inactivate microbes within minutes. The
coatings are based on a polydopamine (PDA) adhesive, which has the useful
property that the monomer can be sprayed, and then the monomer polymerizes in a
conformal film at room temperature. Two coatings are described (1) a coating
where PDA is deposited first and then a thin layer of copper is grown on the PDA 
by electroless deposition (PDA/Cu) and (2) a coating where a suspension of Cu2O
particles in a PDA solution is deposited in a single step (PDA/Cu2O). In the
second coating, PDA menisci bind Cu2O particles to the solid surface. Both
coatings are transparent and are highly efficient in inactivating microbes.
PDA/Cu kills >99.99% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 99.18% of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in only 10 min and inactivates
99.98% of SARS-CoV-2 virus in 1 h. PDA/Cu2O kills 99.94% of P. aeruginosa and
96.82% of MRSA within 10 min and inactivates 99.88% of SARS-CoV-2 in 1 h.
