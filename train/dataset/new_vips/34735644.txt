Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) disease caused by the nervous necrosis virus (NNV)
is a major disease, leading to a huge economic loss in aquaculture. Previous GWAS
and QTL mapping have identified a major QTL for NNV resistance in linkage group
20 in Asian seabass. However, no causative gene for NNV resistance has been
identified. In this study, RNA-seq from brains of Asian seabass fingerlings
challenged with NNV at four time points (5, 10, 15 and 20 days post-challenge)
identified 1228, 245, 189 and 134 DEGs, respectively. Eight DEGs, including rrm1,
were located in the major QTL for NNV resistance. An association study in 445
survived and 608 dead fingerlings after NNV challenge revealed that the SNP in
rrm1 were significantly associated with NNV resistance. Therefore, rrm1 was
selected for functional analysis, as a candidate gene for NNV resistance. The
expression of rrm1 was significantly increased in the gill, liver, spleen and
muscle, and was suppressed in the brain, gut and skin after NNV challenge. The
rrm1 protein was localized in the nuclear membrane. Over-expression of rrm1
significantly decreased viral RNA and titer in NNV-infected Asian seabass cells, 
whereas knock-down of rrm1 significantly increased viral RNA and titer in
NNV-infected Asian seabass cells. The rrm1 knockout heterozygous zebrafish was
more susceptible to NNV infection. Our study suggests that rrm1 is one of the
causative genes for NNV resistance and the SNP in the gene may be applied for
accelerating genetic improvement for NNV resistance.
