Influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics resulting in
morbidity, mortality, and economic losses worldwide. Understanding how to
regulate influenza virus replication is important for developing vaccine and
therapeutic strategies. Identifying microRNAs (miRs) that affect host genes used 
by influenza virus for replication can support an antiviral strategy. In this
study, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and ion channel (IC) host genes in human
alveolar epithelial (A549) cells used by influenza virus for replication
(Orr-Burks et al., 2021) were examined as miR target genes following A/CA/04/09- 
or B/Yamagata/16/1988 replication. Thirty-three miRs were predicted to target
GPCR or IC genes and their miR mimics were evaluated for their ability to
decrease influenza virus replication. Paired miR inhibitors were used as an
ancillary measure to confirm or not the antiviral effects of a miR mimic. Fifteen
miRs lowered influenza virus replication and four miRs were found to reduce
replication irrespective of virus strain and type differences. These findings
provide evidence for novel miR disease intervention strategies for influenza
viruses.
