Although the health and economic risks of COVID-19 may differ for higher- and
lower-socioeconomic-status (SES) populations, some studies found that people with
lower SES do not necessarily experience more psychological panic. In this
research, we examine how SES is related with psychological panic during the
COVID-19 pandemic using a large nationwide Chinese sample. Participants were 933 
adults (mean age = 30.04, SD = 8.19) who completed an online questionnaire
between 11 and 12 February 2020. Lower SES individuals have higher trust in
government and thus experience less psychological panic, and the indirect effect 
of this trust suppresses the direct negative association between SES and
psychological panic. In addition to this difference in trust in government
between lower- and higher-status individuals, the indirect effect of the trust
only exists among people with low (not high) authoritarian personalities. This
study provides evidence that political trust may serve as a buffer, suppressing
the negative association between SES and psychological panic; thus, policies and 
actions enhancing political trust are vital to support the mental health of
individuals with lower SES during the pandemic, especially for citizens with low 
authoritarian personalities.
