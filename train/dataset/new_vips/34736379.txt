BACKGROUND: Acute retinal necrosis normally occurs at the peripheral retina and
gradually merges and progresses to the posterior pole. We report the case of a
patient with optic neuropathy and central retinal vessels as the first
manifestations of Acute retinal necrosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old man was referred with a 10-day vision loss in
his right eye. The visual acuity of the right eye was hand motion. Acute retinal 
necrosis and central retinal artery occlusion were diagnosed. Antiviral drugs,
corticosteroids, and drugs that improve blood circulation were given. The
necrotic retina and swollen optic disc disappeared gradually. However, the final 
vision of this eye declined to no light perception.
CONCLUSION: Acute retinal necrosis should be considered in patients with retinal 
vascular occlusion accompanied by granulomatous anterior uveitis. Further
research is needed to determine whether treatments in addition to antiviral and
corticosteroid therapy are needed.
