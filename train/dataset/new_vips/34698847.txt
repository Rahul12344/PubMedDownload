Importance: Allergic history in individuals with confirmed anaphylaxis to a
messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine is common. However, the risk factors for
allergy symptoms after receiving the vaccine are unknown.
Objective: To assess the association between self-reported history of high-risk
allergy and self-reported allergic reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination of
health care employees.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study obtained demographic,
medical, and vaccine administration data of employees of Mass General Brigham
from the institutional electronic health record. Employees who received at least 
1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine between December 14, 2020, and February 1,
2021, and who completed at least 1 postvaccination symptom survey in the 3 days
after vaccination were included.
Exposures: Self-reported history of high-risk allergy, defined as a previous
severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, an injectable medication, or other
allergen.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was 1 or more self-reported
allergic reactions in the first 3 days after dose 1 or dose 2 of an mRNA COVID-19
vaccine. Multivariable log binomial regression was used to assess the association
between allergic reactions and high-risk allergy status.
Results: A total of 52 998 health care employees (mean [SD] age, 42 [14] years;
38 167 women [72.0%]) were included in the cohort, of whom 51 706 (97.6%)
received 2 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and 474 (0.9%) reported a history of
high-risk allergy. Individuals with vs without a history of high-risk allergy
reported more allergic reactions after receiving dose 1 or 2 of the vaccine
(11.6% [n = 55] vs 4.7% [n = 2461]). In the adjusted model, a history of
high-risk allergy was associated with an increased risk of allergic reactions
(adjusted relative risk [aRR], 2.46; 95% CI, 1.92-3.16), with risk being highest 
for hives (aRR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.33-6.22) and angioedema (aRR, 4.36; 95% CI,
2.52-7.54).
Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that self-reported history of 
high-risk allergy was associated with an increased risk of self-reported allergic
reactions within 3 days of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. However, reported allergy
symptoms did not impede the completion of the 2-dose vaccine protocol among a
cohort of eligible health care employees, supporting the overall safety of mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine.
