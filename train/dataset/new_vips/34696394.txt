Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria and are classified
as either virulent phages or temperate phages. Despite virulent phages being
promising antimicrobial agents due to their bactericidal effects, the
implementation of phage therapy depends on the availability of virulent phages
against target bacteria. Notably, virulent phages of Streptococcus gordonii,
which resides in the oral cavity and is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause 
periodontitis and endocarditis have previously never been found. We thus
attempted to isolate virulent phages against S. gordonii. In the present study,
we report for the first time a virulent bacteriophage against S. gordonii,
ΦSG005, discovered from drainage water. ΦSG005 is composed of a short,
non-contractile tail and a long head, revealing Podoviridae characteristics via
electron microscopic analysis. In turbidity reduction assays, ΦSG005 showed
efficient bactericidal effects on S. gordonii. Whole-genome sequencing showed
that the virus has a DNA genome of 16,127 bp with 21 coding sequences. We
identified no prophage-related elements such as integrase in the ΦSG005 genome,
demonstrating that the virus is a virulent phage. Phylogenetic analysis indicated
that ΦSG005 forms a distinct clade among the streptococcus viruses and is
positioned next to streptococcus virus C1. Molecular characterization revealed
the presence of an anti-CRISPR (Acr) IIA5-like protein in the ΦSG005 genome.
These findings facilitate our understanding of streptococcus viruses and advance 
the development of phage therapy against S. gordonii infection.
