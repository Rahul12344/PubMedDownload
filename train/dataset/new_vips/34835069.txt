Small animal models are of crucial importance for assessing COVID-19
countermeasures. Common laboratory mice would be well-suited for this purpose but
are not susceptible to infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. However, the
development of mouse-adapted virus strains has revealed key mutations in the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that increase infectivity, and interestingly, many of
these mutations are also present in naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants of
concern. This suggests that these variants might have the ability to infect
common laboratory mice. Herein we show that the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant attains
infectibility to BALB/c mice and causes pulmonary changes within 2-3 days post
infection, consistent with results seen in other murine models of COVID-19, at a 
reasonable virus dose (2 Ã— 105 PFU). The findings suggest that common laboratory 
mice can serve as the animal model of choice for testing the effectiveness of
antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
