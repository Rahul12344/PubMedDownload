ABSTRACT: Data from a direct comparison of the long-term survival outcomes of
surgical resection (SR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus transarterial
therapy in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP)-class A patients with a single small T1/T2
stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (≤3 cm) are still lacking. This study
retrospectively compared the therapeutic outcomes of these treatment types for
CTP-A patients with a single small HCC.Using a nationwide Korean registry, we
identified 2314 CTP-A patients with SR (n = 722), RFA (n = 731), or transarterial
therapy (n = 861) for a single (≤3 cm) T1/T2 stage HCC from 2008 to 2014. The
posttreatment overall survival (OS) of transarterial therapy with either SR or
RFA were compared using the Inverse Probability of treatment Weighting (IPW). The
median follow-up period was 50 months (range 1-107 months).After IPW, the
cumulative OS rates after SR or RFA were significantly higher than those after
transarterial therapy in all subjects (all P values < .05). The OS rates after SR
or RFA were better than those after transarterial therapy in patients with the
hepatitis B or C virus (all P values < .05), and in patients aged <65 years (all 
P values < .05). The cumulative OSs between RFA and transarterial therapy were
statistically comparable in patients with a 2 to 3 cm HCC and aged ≥65 years,
respectively. For all subjects, the weighted Cox proportional hazards model using
IPW provided the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for the OS
after SR versus transarterial therapy and after RFA versus transarterial therapy 
of 0.42 (0.30-0.60) (P < .001) and 0.78 (0.61-0.99) (P = .044), respectively.In
CTP-A patients with a single (≤3 cm) T1/T2 HCC, SR or RFA provides a better OS
than transarterial therapy, regardless of the HCC etiology (hepatitis B virus or 
hepatitis C virus), especially in patients with HCC of <2 cm and aged <65 years.
