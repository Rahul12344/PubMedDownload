BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is often
preceded by a recent history of an acute infection and influenza is the most
implicated virus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified two cases of TTP, which were preceded by
influenza between 2010 and 2021. In one patient, we epitope mapped the binding
specificity of antibodies using an overlapping peptide approach of the stalk
protein of Influenza B and the cysteine-rich spacer domain (CRSD) of ADAMTS13. A 
literature search was performed for reports of influenza-associated TTP over the 
period 1980-2021.
RESULTS: Two patients were identified in which TTP was preceded by influenza, one
Influenza A and the other Influenza B. Epitope mapping of the latter's plasma
identified target epitopes in both the stalk protein of Influenza B and CRSD of
ADAMTS13. The literature review revealed only seven case reports, all but one
from Europe or Asia and associated with Influenza A. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency
was demonstrated in only four cases.
CONCLUSION: We report the first small case series of influenza-associated TTP.
Moreover, it is the first case implicating Influenza B and a mechanism favouring 
polyclonal B-cell proliferation rather than molecular mimicry as the stimulus to 
form anti-ADAMTS13 auto-antibodies is suggested.
