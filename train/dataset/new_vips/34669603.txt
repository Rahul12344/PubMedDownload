INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important cause of
mortality and morbidity worldwide. This issue is further exacerbated by the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic.
METHODOLOGY: The study was a retrospective, clinical record review of
hospitalized patients (18 years and older) with a diagnosis of LRTI between the
1st of January 2012 and 31 December 2012, descriptive and comparable analysis was
performed.
RESULTS: Number of patients was 274; 142 (51.8%) males. The commonest final
diagnosis was Pulmonary Tuberclosis (PTB) in 131 (47.8%) and CAP in 127 (46.4%). 
The case fatality rate was 25.5% (70/274) and was significantly associated with
HIV infection (77.4%) (p < 0,01), CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells (96.3), final
diagnosis of TB (65.7%) (p < 0.01), female sex (57%) (p < 0.01), confusion (50%) 
(p < 0.01), age of 65 years or more (29%) (p < 0.01). CURB-65 score (Confusion,
Urea more than 7mmol/l, Respiratory rate (RR) ≥30 breaths /min, low blood
pressure (less than 90 mmHg systolic and 60mmHg diastolic) and age ≥ 65 years)
was only documented in 4 % (11/274) patients. Only 63 patients (23%) met the
admission criteria of two or more points when the CURB-65 score was calculated.
CONCLUSIONS: Failure to use the CURB-65 score resulted in an increase admission
of patients presenting with LRTI. There was an increased case fatality rate in
this high HIV prevalence setting.
