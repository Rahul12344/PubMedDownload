Hepatitis C-induced mixed cryoglobulinemia leading to rapidly progressive
gangrene, necessitating amputations, is a rare presentation. We describe a case
of a 55-year-old man with untreated chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) presenting
with arthralgia and palpable purpura, which rapidly progressed to
life-threatening gangrene of all extremities requiring amputations in the setting
of mixed cryoglobulinemia. Treatment for HCV was initiated which led to the
arrest of gangrene progression and the patient's survival. Patients with
HCV-induced cryoglobulinemia should be closely monitored and started on early
therapy with direct-acting antiviral therapy to prevent progression of vasculitis
to gangrene. Universal screening for HCV can aid in early diagnosis and treatment
to prevent devastating consequences.
