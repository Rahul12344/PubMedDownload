In some subjects with inherited pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPG) syndromes,
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) stabilization/activation could lead to
an increase in angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE). This would result in the
stimulation of angiotensin (AT) II production and, hence, reduce the availability
of ACE 2. The latter would provide decreased numbers of binding sites for the
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, result in less points of viral entry 
into cells. Thus, subjects with HIF1α-associated PPG syndromes may benefit from
an inherent protective effect against COVID-19. Such an implication of HIF1α
vis-à-vis COVID-19 could open ways of therapeutic interventions.
