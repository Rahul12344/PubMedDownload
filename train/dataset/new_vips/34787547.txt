INTRODUCTION: Emergency medical services (EMS) dispatchers have made efforts to
determine whether patients are high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
so that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) can be donned. A
screening tool is valuable as the healthcare community balances protection of
medical personnel and conservation of PPE. There is little existing literature on
the efficacy of prehospital COVID-19 screening tools. The objective of this study
was to determine the positive and negative predictive value of an emergency
infectious disease surveillance tool for detecting COVID-19 patients and the
impact of positive screening on PPE usage.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of prehospital care reports 
and hospital electronic health records. We abstracted records for all 911 calls
to an urban EMS from March 1-July 31, 2020 that had a documented positive screen 
for COVID-19 and/or had a positive COVID-19 test. The dispatch screen solicited
information regarding travel, sick contacts, and high-risk symptoms. We reviewed 
charts to determine dispatch-screening results, the outcome of patients' COVID-19
testing, and documentation of crew fidelity to PPE guidelines.
RESULTS: The sample size was 263. The rate of positive COVID-19 tests for
all-comers in the state of Massachusetts was 2.0%. The dispatch screen had a
sensitivity of 74.9% (confidence interval [CI], 69.21-80.03) and a specificity of
67.7% (CI, 66.91-68.50). The positive predictive value was 4.5% (CI, 4.17-4.80), 
and the negative predictive value was 99.3% (CI, 99.09-99.40). The most common
symptom that triggered a positive screen was shortness of breath (51.5% of
calls). The most common high-risk population identified was skilled nursing
facility patients (19.5%), but most positive tests did not belong to a high-risk 
population (58.1%). The EMS personnel were documented as wearing full PPE for the
patient in 55.7% of encounters, not wearing PPE in 8.0% of encounters, and not
documented in 27.9% of encounters.
CONCLUSION: This dispatch-screening questionnaire has a high negative predictive 
value but moderate sensitivity and therefore should be used with some caution to 
guide EMS crews in their PPE usage. Clinical judgment is still essential and may 
supersede screening status.
