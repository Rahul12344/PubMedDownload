Many SARS-CoV-2 variants have mutations at key sites targeted by antibodies.
However, it is unknown if antibodies elicited by infection with these variants
target the same or different regions of the viral spike as antibodies elicited by
earlier viral isolates. Here we compare the specificities of polyclonal
antibodies produced by humans infected with early 2020 isolates versus the
B.1.351 variant of concern (also known as Beta or 20H/501Y.V2), which contains
mutations in multiple key spike epitopes. The serum neutralizing activity of
antibodies elicited by infection with both early 2020 viruses and B.1.351 is
heavily focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, within the
RBD, B.1.351-elicited antibodies are more focused on the "class 3" epitope
spanning sites 443 to 452, and neutralization by these antibodies is notably less
affected by mutations at residue 484. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 variants
can elicit polyclonal antibodies with different immunodominance hierarchies.
