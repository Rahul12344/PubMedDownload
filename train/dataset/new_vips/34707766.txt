Introduction: dental procedures produce bio-aerosols that can carry the highly
contagious COVID-19 virus. Hence, the entire dental care team has to follow the
current COVID-19 related infection control protocols. The study aims to assess
the knowledge, attitude, and practices associated with infection control methods 
during dental procedures among dental practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic 
in India.
Methods: the online questionnaire consisted of four sections namely, demographic 
details, eight questions on knowledge, four questions on attitude and eight
questions on the practice of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic. One point was
attributed for a correct response and zero point for an incorrect response. The
study used descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression models in Jamovi
1.8.1 to establish relationships between knowledge, attitude, and practices among
dental professionals and their demographic characteristics.
Results: among 384 dentists, 294 (76.6%) were aware of the hand hygiene methods, 
372 dentists (96.9%) were aware of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 343
dentists (89.3%) recorded the body temperature of the patients. One hundred and
thirty eight (138) dentists (35.9%) did not use rubber dam and 158 dentists
(41.1%) were not aware of the four-handed dentistry. Among the study
participants, 57.8% displayed adequate knowledge, 63.8% possessed good attitude
and 93.5% followed good practices on COVID-19 appropriate infection control
measures during dental procedures. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice
scores were found to be 6.61, 2.04, and 3.38 respectively. Based on multivariable
binary logistic regression analysis, it is observed that males (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI
0.35-0.87; p=0.011) have a lower likelihood of having a good knowledge when
compared with females after adjusting for the other independent variables in the 
model. Also, individuals with higher qualifications (aOR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92;
p=0.022) appear to have lower likelihood of having good knowledge on COVID-19
infection control methods during dental procedure.
Conclusion: the study concludes that participants possess sound knowledge,
attitude and practice on hand hygiene, PPE, patient triage and waiting area
modifications at the workplace. However, poor response was noted on the use of
rubber dam, remote telephonic screening and four-handed dentistry practice.
