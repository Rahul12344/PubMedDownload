COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) is associated with an increased risk for
thrombosis due to endothelial dysfunction and hyperactivation of the immune
system induced by the virus. Most cases of venous thromboembolism associated with
COVID-19 are either pulmonary emboli or deep vein thromboses. Ovarian vein
thrombosis is a rare condition most commonly seen in the postpartum period. This 
report describes a case of COVID-19-associated ovarian vein thrombosis in a
nonpregnant woman with no evidence of underlying inherited coagulopathy.
