The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented threat to humanity that has provoked
global health concerns. Since the etiopathogenesis of this illness is not fully
characterized, the prognostic factors enabling treatment decisions have not been 
well documented. Accurately predicting the progression of the disease would aid
in appropriate patient categorization and thus help determine the best treatment 
option. Here, we have introduced a proteomic approach utilizing data-independent 
acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) to identify the serum proteins that are
closely associated with COVID-19 prognosis. Twenty-seven proteins were
differentially expressed between severely ill COVID-19 patients with an adverse
or favorable prognosis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that 15 of the 27
proteins might be regulated by cytokine signaling relevant to interleukin
(IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and their differential expression
was implicated in the systemic inflammatory response and in cardiovascular
disorders. We further evaluated practical predictors of the clinical prognosis of
severe COVID-19 patients. Subsequent ELISA assays revealed that CHI3L1 and IGFALS
may serve as highly sensitive prognostic markers. Our findings can help formulate
a diagnostic approach for accurately identifying COVID-19 patients with severe
disease and for providing appropriate treatment based on their predicted
prognosis.
