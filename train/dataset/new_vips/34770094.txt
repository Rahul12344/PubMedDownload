Exercise is known for its beneficial effects on preventing cardiometabolic
diseases (CMDs) in the general population. People living with the human
immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) are prone to sedentarism, thus raising their
already elevated risk of developing CMDs in comparison to individuals without
HIV. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine if exercise is
associated with reduced risk of self-reported CMDs in a German HIV-positive
sample (n = 446). Participants completed a self-report survey to assess exercise 
levels, date of HIV diagnosis, CD4 cell count, antiretroviral therapy, and CMDs. 
Participants were classified into exercising or sedentary conditions. Generalized
linear models with Poisson regression were conducted to assess the prevalence
ratio (PR) of PLWH reporting a CMD. Exercising PLWH were less likely to report a 
heart arrhythmia for every increase in exercise duration (PR: 0.20: 95% CI:
0.10-0.62, p < 0.01) and diabetes mellitus for every increase in exercise session
per week (PR: 0.40: 95% CI: 0.10-1, p < 0.01). Exercise frequency and duration
are associated with a decreased risk of reporting arrhythmia and diabetes
mellitus in PLWH. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying exercise as a protective factor for CMDs in PLWH.
