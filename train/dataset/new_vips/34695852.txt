Cardiovascular manifestations are frequent in COVID-19 infection and are
predictive of adverse outcomes. Elevated cardiac biomarkers are common findings
in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and severe COVID-19 infection.
Troponin, inflammatory and thrombotic markers may also improve risk prediction in
COVID-19. In our comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the incidence,
potential mechanisms and outcome of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19. Thereby, we
discuss coagulation abnormalities in sepsis and altered immune response as
contributing factors favoring myocardial injury. We further highlight the role of
endothelial damage in the pathophysiological concepts. Finally, observational
studies addressing the incidence of myocardial infarction during COVID-19
pandemic are discussed.
