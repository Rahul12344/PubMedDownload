The main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 virus is a cysteine enzyme
critical for viral replication and transcription, thus indicating a potential
target for antiviral therapy. A recent repurposing effort has identified ebselen,
a multifunctional drug candidate as an inhibitor of Mpro. Our docking of ebselen 
to the binding pocket of Mpro crystal structure suggests a noncovalent
interaction for improvement of potency, antiviral activity and selectivity. To
test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized ebselen derivatives aimed at
enhancing their non-covalent bonds within Mpro. The inhibition of Mpro by ebselen
derivatives (0.3 μM) was screened in both HPLC and FRET assays. Nine ebselen
derivatives (EBs) exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on Mpro with IC50 of
0.07-0.38 μM. Further evaluation of three derivatives showed that EB2-7 exhibited
the most potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50 value of 
4.08 µM in HPAepiC cells, as compared to the prototype ebselen at 24.61 μM.
Mechanistically, EB2-7 functions as a noncovalent Mpro inhibitor in LC-MS/MS
assay. Taken together, our identification of ebselen derivatives with improved
antiviral activity may lead to developmental potential for treatment of COVID-19 
and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
