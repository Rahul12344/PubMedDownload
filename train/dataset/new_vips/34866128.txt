Diagnostics, vaccines and drugs are indispensable tools and control measures in
order to overcome infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Diagnostic tools based on RT-PCR were developed early in the COVID-19
pandemic, which were urgently required for quarantine (test, trace and
isolation). Vaccines were also successfully developed using new platform
technologies such as mRNA vaccines and virus-vectored vaccines within one year
after identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as
a causative agent of COVID-19. Drug development has been conducted in various
ways including drug repurposing, convalescent plasma therapy, and monoclonal
antibody development. Among all these efforts, COVID-19 drug development will be 
reviewed along with upcoming challenges.
