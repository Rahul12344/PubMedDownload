Socioeconomic crisis and humanitarian disasters can cause increased stress for
women who experience inter-partner violence (IPV). This study analyzed the impact
of the COVID-19 lockdown on this important issue, their related health and social
services and working conditions from the perspectives of professionals in
different sectors. Forty-three semi-structured interviews were carried out with
47 professionals (44 women and 3 men) from 40 different entities (September
2020-April 2021). This content analysis suggests that the pandemic and its
associated prevention measures have had a negative impact on women exposed to IPV
and their children, which affected their social wellbeing. Professionals
described burnout, difficult and slow administrative processes, and problems with
coordination and access to information. These negative impacts were mitigated, in
part, by the work of professionals, but this suggests that a series of key
strategies are needed to improve the response capacity of the service sector to
IPV in situations of crisis. These improvements are related to the availability
of human and material resources; an efficient coordination network between the
professionals from different sectors; existence of informal support networks in
the community; protocols/procedures and prior training for better implementation;
and greater flexibility and accessibility of basic services that benefit women
who experience IPV.
