BACKGROUND: Vaccination created a great breakthrough toward the improvement to
the global health. The development of vaccines and their use made a substantial
decrease and control in infectious diseases. The abundance and emergence of new
vaccines has facilitated targeting populations to alleviate and eliminate
contagious pathogens from their innate reservoir. However, along with the
infections like malaria and HIV, effective immunization remains obscure and
imparts a great challenge to science.
PURPOSE AND SCOPE: The novel Corona virus SARS-CoV-2 is the reason for the 2019
COVID-19 pandemic in the human global population, in the first half of 2019. The 
need for establishing a protected and compelling COVID-19 immunization is a
global prerequisite to end this pandemic.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The different vaccine technologies like inactivation,
attenuation, nucleic acid, viral vector, subunit, and viral particle based
techniques are employed to develop a safe and highly efficient vaccine. The
progress in vaccine development for SARS-CoV2 is much faster in the history of
science. Even though there exist of lot of limitations, continuous efforts has
put forward so as to develop highly competent and effective vaccine for many
human and animal linked diseases due to its unlimited prospective. This review
article focuses on the historical outlook and the development of the vaccine as
it is a crucial area of research where the life of the human is saved from
various potential diseases.
