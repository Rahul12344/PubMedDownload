OBJECTIVES: to map the production of scientific knowledge on the clinical
progression of COVID-19 coinfection in people living with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
METHODS: scoping review, with search strategies in MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Web
of Science, and LILACS. Dual independent data extraction and analysis of the
material with similarity compilation and narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: sample consisted of 35 articles. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most
prevalent signs/symptoms. Recurrent complications involved desaturation/worsening
of oxygen desaturation and pneumonia. No standard pharmacological treatment was
identified, and the main interventions involved the provision of supplemental
oxygen and mechanical ventilation. The studies recommended preventive, care, and 
pharmacological practices.
CONCLUSIONS: the clinical manifestations, complications, and
treatments/assistance care for people coinfected with SARS CoV-2/HIV are similar 
to those of the general population. Coinfection, overall, does not infer a worse 
prognosis.
