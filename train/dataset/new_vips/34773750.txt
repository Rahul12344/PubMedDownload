The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a worldwide health crisis. Rapid diagnosis,
new therapeutics and effective vaccines will all be required to stop the spread
of COVID-19. Quantitative evaluation of serum antibody levels against the
SARS-CoV-2 virus provides a means of monitoring a patient's immune response to a 
natural viral infection or vaccination, as well as evidence of a prior infection.
In this paper, a portable and low-cost electrochemical immunosensor is developed 
for the rapid and accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. The
immunosensor is capable of quantifying the concentrations of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
in human serum. For IgG and IgM, it provides measurements in the range of
10.1 ng/mL - 60 μg/mL and 1.64 ng/mL - 50 μg/mL, respectively, both with an assay
time of 13 min. We also developed device stabilization and storage strategies to 
achieve stable performance of the immunosensor over 24-week storage at room
temperature. We evaluated the performance of the immunosensor using COVID-19
patient serum samples collected at different time points after symptom onset. The
rapid and sensitive detection of IgG and IgM provided by our immunosensor
fulfills the need of rapid COVID-19 serological testing for both point-of-care
diagnosis and population immunity screening.
