The peptide Tyr-Ser-Glu-Ala-Thr-Val-Ala-Glu-Ser-Asp-Ser-Phe (the predicted
C-terminal 11 amino acids of the TMV 30kDa open reading frame plus an additional 
N-terminal Tyr residue) was synthesized by solid phase methods and used to raise 
antisera in rabbits. These antisera precipitated 4 major proteins (p30, p28, p19 
and 18.5kDa) from in vitro translation products of TMV short rod RNA, but only
one, of apparent M r = 30500, from TMV-infected tobacco protoplasts. This protein
was made between 8 and 16 h post infection, and had [35S]Met-labelled tryptic
peptides identical to those of in vitro synthesized p30.
