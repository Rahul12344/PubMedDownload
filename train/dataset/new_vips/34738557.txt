Nepal's second wave of COVID-19 has become the worst the world has seen so far.
For a population of 29 million people, Nepal currently has only 1127 ICU beds and
453 ventilators for the entire population. The fragile healthcare system is
already overwhelmed with every emergency room full of patients. Due to the
unavailability of ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen, and other vital resources, sick 
patients are forced to stay at home with home isolation and treatment. The
situation is dire, and resources are saturated. Only humanitarian aid from
foreign countries can help mitigate the unprecedented disaster.
