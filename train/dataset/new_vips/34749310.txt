Transovarial transmission (TOT) of dengue virus (DENV) in Aedes spp. is an
important mechanism for DENV maintenance in nature and may be important in
initiating outbreaks. The objective of this study was to explore the occurrence
of TOT in wild Aedes albopictus populations in Cuba. Mosquito larvae were
collected in Cotorro municipality, Havana, Cuba, and identified to species.
Fifteen pools of Ae. albopictus each containing 30 larvae were processed for DENV
detection by using conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR. Four out of 15 pools
processed were positive for DENV-3, but no other DENV serotype was detected. This
is the first time TOT of DENV detected in Cuban field populations of Ae.
albopictus, and this suggests that this species may be an important vector of
DENV in Cuba.
