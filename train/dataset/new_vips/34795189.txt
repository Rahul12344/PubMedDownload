BACKGROUND: The course of chronic diseases can be influenced by psychological
stress, suggesting a potential influence of current/recent disasters on atopic
dermatitis (AD) patients. The aim of the study was to examine effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and Zagreb earthquake on the psychological stress level and
disease condition of AD patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 150 AD patients (three 
groups with 50 patients): 1) those not exposed to either the COVID-19 pandemic or
the earthquake; 2) those who only experienced the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) those
who experienced both the pandemic and the earthquake. Patients' data from the
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), on AD severity (SCORAD), and their answers from our
newly designed questionnaire on disease-related behaviors and AD condition during
the pandemic and quarantine were examined and statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: The subjects who experienced both disasters had a greater PSS than those
experiencing only the COVID-19 pandemic, especially women, and they also had
higher disease severity (SCORAD) than those in the other two groups. Also, 59% of
patients reported psychological stress during the pandemic, mostly caused by: the
possibility of infection (31%), a changed work life and possible loss of income
(23%), general pandemic-related conditions (17%), worry about physical survival
(11%) and other (6%). Concerning the earthquake, the PSS significantly positively
correlated with the psychological experience of the earthquake and with the
intensity of sleep disturbances.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically
confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced AD patients' stress levels and that
stress from two disasters affected skin disease. Further research and therapeutic
measures are needed.
