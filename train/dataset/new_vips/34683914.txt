In the last decade, the interest in ferritin-based vaccines has been increasing
due to their safety and immunogenicity. Candidates against a wide range of
pathogens are now on Phase I clinical trials namely for influenza, Epstein-Barr, 
and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Manufacturing challenges related to particle
heterogeneity, improper folding of fused antigens, and antigen interference with 
intersubunit interactions still need to be overcome. In addition, protocols need 
to be standardized so that the production bioprocess becomes reproducible,
allowing ferritin-based therapeutics to become readily available. In this review,
the building blocks that enable the formulation of ferritin-based vaccines at an 
experimental stage, including design, production, and purification are presented.
Novel bioengineering strategies of functionalizing ferritin nanoparticles based
on modular assembly, allowing the challenges associated with genetic fusion to be
circumvented, are discussed. Distinct up/down-stream approaches to produce
ferritin-based vaccines and their impact on production yield and vaccine efficacy
are compared. Finally, ferritin nanoparticles currently used in vaccine
development and clinical trials are summarized.
