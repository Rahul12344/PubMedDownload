BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared as pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Social
distancing and hand hygiene is advised during the pandemic to contain the spread 
of the virus. Rapid sharing of scientific information in an extraordinary way is 
the characteristic of the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be gap between information
provided and received. Perception and practices in the community regarding
handling materials need to be pointed out. the aim of this study was to assess
the perception about myths and facts and change in the practices before and
during the COVID-19 pandemic among the faculties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during May-June
2020 among the faculties of Science and Technology. By multistage sampling
technique, five districts from Maharashtra state and then one institution from
each district was selected. A questionnaire was shared by Internet to
institutional faculties. Descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square test)
is applied.
RESULTS: Out of 276 faculties, 248 had responded. Most of the faculties were
aware about basic preventive measures for COVID-19 infection. However, 25% of the
faculties were unaware about the safe physical distance. Eating garlic and pepper
protect against COVID-19 as per 63 (25.3%) and 59 (23.9%) faculties,
respectively, was effective, whereas 56.8% of participants did not believe so. 93
(37.5%) respondents believed that respiratory function ultimately indicates the
presence or absence of disease. About 95% of participants adopted new hygienic
practices during the pandemic (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can spread rapidly if the basic preventive measures are
ignored by the small proportion of unaware people Hence, awareness needs to be
improved. People have adapted to new hygienic practices for handling the material
during the pandemic.
