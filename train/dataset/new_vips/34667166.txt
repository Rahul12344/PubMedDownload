Protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases have the ability to
transmit to unaffected cells, thereby templating their own aberrant conformation 
onto soluble homotypic proteins. Proteopathic seeds can be released into the
extracellular space, secreted in association with extracellular vesicles (EV) or 
exchanged by direct cell-to-cell contact. The extent to which each of these
pathways contribute to the prion-like spreading of protein misfolding is unclear.
Exchange of cellular cargo by both direct cell contact or via EV depends on
receptor-ligand interactions. We hypothesized that enabling these interactions
through viral ligands enhances intercellular proteopathic seed transmission.
Using different cellular models propagating prions or pathogenic Tau aggregates, 
we demonstrate that vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 spike 
S increase aggregate induction by cell contact or ligand-decorated EV. Thus,
receptor-ligand interactions are important determinants of intercellular
aggregate dissemination. Our data raise the possibility that viral infections
contribute to proteopathic seed spreading by facilitating intercellular cargo
transfer.
