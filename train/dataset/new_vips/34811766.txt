AIMS: To describe oral manifestations in children born with microcephaly
attributed to congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS).
METHODS: Data was collected in semiannual intervals from 2017 to 2019, by oral
exams of the children and interview with caregivers at a Public Dental Center in 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A single calibrated examiner performed clinical
examinations.
RESULTS: Of 38 eligible children, 34 were followed-up from 12 to 30 months of
age, 20 boys and 14 girls. The mean age of emergence of their first primary tooth
was 12.4 months (SD = 2.9). By 30 months of age only 14.7% (n = 5) had complete
primary dentition. Alteration in the sequence of tooth emergence was observed in 
41.1% (n = 14). Radiographic examination demonstrated dental agenesis (14.7% n = 
5). Dental developmental alterations (38.2%, n = 13), enamel defects (14.7%, n = 
5), eruption cysts/hematoma (23.5%, n = 8), gingival bleeding (55.8%, n = 19),
narrow palate, and bruxism (64.7%, n = 22) were also observed. No child had
dental caries.
CONCLUSION: Children with microcephaly attributed to CZS presented oral
manifestations early in life.
