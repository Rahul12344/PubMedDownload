Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus, but
few drugs are available for its treatment. Consequently, researchers have been
engaged in efforts to discover new antiviral mechanisms that can lay the
foundation for novel anti-influenza drugs. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) is an enzyme that plays an indispensable role in the viral infection
process, which is directly linked to the survival of the virus. Methods of
inhibiting PB1-PB2 (basic polymerase 1-basic polymerase 2) interactions, which
are a key part of RdRp enzyme activity, are integral in the design of novel
antiviral drugs, a specific PB1-PB2 interactions inhibitor has not been reported.
We have screened Enamine's database and conducted a parallel screening of
multiple docking schemes, followed by simulations of molecular dynamics to
determine the structure of a stable ligand-PB1 complex. We also calculated the
free energy of binding between the screened compounds and PB1 protein.
Ultimately, we screened and identified a potential PB1-PB2 inhibitor using the
ADMET prediction model.
