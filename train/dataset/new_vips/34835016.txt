Cotton is the most important fiber crop worldwide. To determine the presence of
viruses in cotton plants showing leaf roll and vein yellowing symptoms in Henan
Province of China, a small RNA-based deep sequencing approach was performed.
Analysis of the de novo-assembled contigs followed by reverse transcription PCR
allowed the reconstruction of watermelon mosaic virus and an unknown virus. The
genome of the unknown virus was determined to be 5870 nucleotides in length, and 
has a genomic organization with characteristic features of previously reported
poleroviruses. Sequence analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to, 
but significantly different from, cotton leafroll dwarf virus, a polerovirus of
the family Solemoviridae. This virus had less than 90% amino acid sequence
identity in the products of both ORF0 and ORF1. According to the polerovirus
species demarcation criteria set by the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses, this virus should be assigned to a new polerovirus species, for which we
propose the name "cotton leaf roll virus".
