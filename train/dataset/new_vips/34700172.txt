BACKGROUND: Numerous case reports and case series have described brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients 
with concurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
PURPOSE: We aim to compile and analyze brain MRI findings in patients with
COVID-19 disease and PRES.
METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched on April 5th, 2021 using the terms
"COVID-19", "PRES", "SARS-CoV-2" for peer-reviewed publications describing brain 
MRI findings in patients 21 years of age or older with evidence of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and PRES.
RESULTS: Twenty manuscripts were included in the analysis, which included
descriptions of 30 patients. The average age was 57 years old. Twenty-four
patients (80%) required mechanical ventilation. On brain MRI examinations, 15
(50%) and 7 (23%) of patients exhibited superimposed foci of hemorrhage and
restricted diffusion respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: PRES is a potential neurological complication of COVID-19 related
disease. COVID-19 patients with PRES may exhibit similar to mildly greater rates 
of superimposed hemorrhage compared to non-COVID-19 PRES patients.
