Tomato torrado virus (ToTV) induces severe systemic necrosis in Solanum
lycopersicum. This work aimed at describing the genetic variability of
necrosis-inducing ToTV-Wal'17 collected in 2017, derived from the ToTV-Wal'03
after long-term passages in plants. Sequence analyses of the ToTV-Wal'17
indicated twenty-eight single nucleotide substitutions in coding sequence of both
RNAs, twelve of which resulted in amino acid changes in viral polyproteins.
Moreover the sequencing data revealed that the 3'UTR of ToTV-Wal'17 RNA1 was 394 
nts shorter in comparison to Wal'03. The performed sequence analyses revealed
that 3'UTR of RNA1 of ToTV-Wal'17 is the most divergent across all previously
described European isolates.
