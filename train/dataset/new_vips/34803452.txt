Propolis is a multi-functional bee product rich in polyphenols. In this study,
the inhibitory effect of Anatolian propolis against SARS-coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) was investigated in vitro and in silico. Raw and commercial propolis
samples were used, and both samples were found to be rich in caffeic acid,
p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, t-cinnamic acid, hesperetin, chrysin, pinocembrin,
and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) at HPLC-UV analysis. Ethanolic propolis
extracts (EPE) were used in the ELISA screening test against the spike S1 protein
(SARS-CoV-2): ACE-2 interaction for in vitro study. The binding energy values of 
these polyphenols to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE-2 protein were calculated
separately with a molecular docking study using the AutoDock 4.2.6 program. In
addition, the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of these eight
polyphenols were calculated according to the SwissADME tool. The binding energy
value of pinocembrin was highest in both receptors, followed by chrysin, CAPE,
and hesperetin. Based on the in silico modeling and ADME (absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion) behaviors of the eight polyphenols, the 
compounds exhibited the potential ability to act effectively as novel drugs. The 
findings of both studies showed that propolis has a high inhibitory potential
against the Covid-19 virus. However, further studies are now needed.
