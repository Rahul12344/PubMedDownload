The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in
early 2020. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected morbidity and mortality
tremendously. Even though multiple drugs are being used throughout the world
since the advent of COVID-19, only limited treatment options are available for
COVID-19. Therefore, drugs targeting various pathologic aspects of the disease
are being explored. Multiple studies have been published to demonstrate their
clinical efficacy until now. Based on the current evidence to date, we summarized
the mechanism, roles, and side effects of all existing treatment options to
target this potentially fatal virus.
