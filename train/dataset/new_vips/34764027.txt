Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. CMV is a
ubiquitous Herpesviridae virus with a wide spectrum of pathologies in humans.
Immunocompetent patients generally develop a benign, self-limited
mononucleosis-like syndrome, whereas gastrointestinal tissue-invasive disease is 
more frequently seen in immunocompromised. The clinical manifestations of CMV
colitis or proctitis are demarcated by bloody diarrhea, ulcerations,
ulcero-infiltrative changes, and pseudomembranous formation on colonoscopy.
Gastrointestinal CMV infections complicated with deep rectal ulcer and fistula
formation are rare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Ganciclovir is 
also the gold standard therapy for CMV colitis or proctitis.
