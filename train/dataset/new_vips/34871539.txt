OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis examined the prognostic role of brain and acute
leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC), Ecotropic virus integration site-1 (EVI1) and
Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) genes at different time-points during conventional
chemotherapy.
METHODS: A systematic search of publications indexed in the electronic databases 
from January 1988 to October 2020 was performed. Over 7525 cases of AML from 25
studies were involved.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, overexpression of either BAALC or EVI1 had a negative
impact on complete remission achievement (Summary Odds ratios [SORs] for
BAALC = 0.32; SORs for EVI1 = 0.49) and survival outcome. The summary hazard
ratios of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 1.97 and
2.04 for BAALC and 1.33 and 1.86 for EVI1, respectively. The prognostic value of 
pretreatment WT1 levels was heterogeneous while subgroup analyses unveiled that
overexpressed WT1 may correlate with a favorable outcome (summary hazard ratio
[SHR] for OS = 0.42). Both WT1 and BAALC played a role in prognosis assessment at
post-induction and the diagnostic performance of WT1 transcript reduction was
superior to the absolute WT1 level. Post-consolidation WT1 overexpression
consistently indicated an increased risk of relapse, while the combined HR for
RFS was statistically insignificant (SHR = 4.22).
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the application of BAALC and EVI1 at
diagnosis, WT1 after induction chemotherapy in AML patients throughout
conventional chemotherapy.
