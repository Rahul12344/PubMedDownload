BACKGROUND: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a comprehensive syndrome
characterized by an acute deterioration of liver function and high short-term
mortality rates in patients with chronic liver disease. Whether plasma soluble
urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a suitable biomarker for the 
prognosis of patients with ACLF remains unknown.
METHOD: A prospective cohort of 282 patients with ACLF from three hospitals in
China was included. 88.4% of the group was hepatitis B virus-related ACLF
(HBV-related ACLF). Cox regression was used to assess the impact of plasma suPAR 
and other factors on 30- and 90-day mortality. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production were detected to explore the role of suPAR in regulating neutrophil
function in HBV-related ACLF.
RESULT: There was no difference in plasma suPAR levels between HBV-related and
non-HBV-related ACLF. Patients with clinical complications had higher suPAR
levels than those without these complications. A significant correlation was also
found between suPAR and prognostic scores, infection indicators and inflammatory 
cytokines. Cox's regression multivariate analysis identified suPAR ≥ 14.7 ng/mL
as a predictor for both day 30 and 90 mortality (Area under the ROC curve: 0.751 
and 0.742 respectively), independent of the MELD and SOFA scores in patients with
ACLF. Moreover, we firstly discovered suPAR enhanced neutrophil ROS production
under E.coli stimulation in patients with HBV-related ACLF.
CONCLUSIONS: suPAR was a useful independent biomarker of short-term outcomes in
patients with ACLF and might play a key role in the pathogenesis. Trial
registration CNT, NCT02965560.
