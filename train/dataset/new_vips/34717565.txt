BACKGROUND: Norovirus (NoV) is the main cause of non-bacterial acute
gastroenteritis (AGE) outbreaks worldwide. From September 2015 through August
2018, 203 NoV outbreaks involving 2500 cases were reported to the Shenzhen Center
for Disease Control and Prevention.
METHODS: Faecal specimens for 203 outbreaks were collected and epidemiological
data were obtained through the AGE outbreak surveillance system in Shenzhen.
Genotypes were determined by sequencing analysis. To gain a better understanding 
of the evolutionary characteristics of NoV in Shenzhen, molecular evolution and
mutations were evaluated based on time-scale evolutionary phylogeny and amino
acid mutations.
RESULTS: A total of nine districts reported NoV outbreaks and the reported NoV
outbreaks peaked from November to March. Among the 203 NoV outbreaks, 150 were
sequenced successfully. Most of these outbreaks were associated with the NoV
GII.2[P16] strain (45.3%, 92/203) and occurred in school settings (91.6%,
186/203). The evolutionary rates of the RdRp region and the VP1 sequence were
2.1 × 10-3 (95% HPD interval, 1.7 × 10-3-2.5 × 10-3) substitutions/site/year and 
2.7 × 10-3 (95% HPD interval, 2.4 × 10-3-3.1 × 10-3) substitutions/site/year,
respectively. The common ancestors of the GII.2[P16] strain from Shenzhen and
GII.4 Sydney 2012[P16] diverged from 2011 to 2012. The common ancestors of the
GII.2[P16] strain from Shenzhen and previous GII.2[P16] (2010-2012) diverged from
2003 to 2004. The results of amino acid mutations showed 6 amino acid
substitutions (*77E, R750K, P845Q, H1310Y, K1546Q, T1549A) were found only in
GII.4 Sydney 2012[P16] and the GII.2[P16] recombinant strain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the molecular epidemiological patterns in
Shenzhen, China, from September 2015 to August 2018 and provides evidence that
the epidemic trend of GII.2[P16] recombinant strain had weakened and the
non-structural proteins of the recombinant strain might have played a more
significant role than VP1.
