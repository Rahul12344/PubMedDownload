This study aimed to analyze the risks that affect the Umm al-Nasr village (north 
of Gaza Strip), which include wars, floods, and the Corona virus disease-19
(COVID-19) pandemic, which may require the emergency committee to identify places
for sanitary isolation in the case of infection or provide shelters in the
disasters such as wars and floods. A plan that contains procedures for managing
the displacement of the citizens according to the type of the disaster and the
suggested safe shelters were prepared. Individuals infected with COVID-19 are
isolated in central places or their home. Responding procedures for the emergency
committee in Umm al-Nasr municipality were prepared to deal with displaced
people. A mathematical model was designed to simulate choosing a shelter for the 
citizens of this village depending on the type of crisis. The results showed the 
different conditions that may affect the displacement operation, such as the type
of shelter, the allocated area, the number of displaced citizens, the type of
disaster, and the required speed to reach the shelter. This study recommended
advancing the capabilities of the community to confront risks and COVID-19.
Besides, perfect planning plays a significant role in saving lives, time, and
effort. Therefore, it is needed to cooperate with the local authorities, such as 
municipalities, ministry of health, civil defense, and international institutions
to implement a response action during disasters, and the necessity of closing
residential areas and isolating them if new cases of COVID-19 appear.
