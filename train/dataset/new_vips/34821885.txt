The global COVID-19 pandemic starting at 2020 induced by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) has revealed a very
pressing need for rapid, affordable and effective diagnosis for epidemic
management and control. Although several commercialized analytical methods (e.g.,
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay) have been developed for detecting SARS-CoV-2, they are expensive and
time-consuming. Most recently, low-cost molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based
sensors have received attention. In this study, by introducing gold/graphene
(Au/Gr) nanohybrids to modify a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) and using 
arginine as the functional monomer, a simple and highly sensitive MIP sensor was 
proposed to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (ncovNP). By optimizing
various influencing factors, the proposed MIP sensor shows wide linear range and 
low detection limit for ncovNP owing to excellent electrical property and large
surface of Au/Gr and specific recognition ability of MIP, revealing important
potential application for the effective early diagnosis of COVID-19.
