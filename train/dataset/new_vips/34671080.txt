Monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity are valuable for 
a wide range of biomedical applications involving novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) diagnosis, treatment, and prophylactic intervention. Strategies for
the rapid and reliable isolation of these antibodies, especially potent
neutralizing antibodies, are critical toward improved COVID-19 response and
informed future response to emergent infectious diseases. In this study, single B
cell screening was used to interrogate antibody repertoires of immunized mice and
isolate antigen-specific IgG1+ memory B cells. Using these methods,
high-affinity, potent neutralizing antibodies were identified that target the
receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Further engineering of the identified
molecules to increase valency resulted in enhanced neutralizing activity.
Mechanistic investigation revealed that these antibodies compete with ACE2 for
binding to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies may
warrant further development for urgent COVID-19 applications. Overall, these
results highlight the potential of single B cell screening for the rapid and
reliable identification of high-affinity, potent neutralizing antibodies for
infectious disease applications.
