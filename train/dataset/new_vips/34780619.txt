IMPORTANCE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a severe psychological
impact on frontline and second-line medical workers. However, few empirical
reports have been published on its impact on occupational therapists. Clarifying 
the mental health status of occupational therapists is important to maintain care
quality and prevent psychological problems in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Japanese
occupational therapists in prefectures with and without severe pandemic-related
restrictions and elucidate factors associated with psychological problems such as
anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional online survey using region-stratified two-stage cluster
sampling conducted May 28-31, 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 371 participants (63.1% women) in the
prefectures under specific cautions (i.e., where residents were strictly advised 
to refrain from outings) and 1,312 in the prefectures without such cautions
(61.9% women).
RESULTS: The increase in workload due to the pandemic was significantly related
to an increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and an attempt to avoid
talking face to face with others was significantly related to an increase in
anxiety regardless of area. In prefectures under specific cautions as of May 25, 
2020, the provision of sufficient information on COVID-19 by the workplace
significantly reduced the risk of insomnia. In other prefectures, the provision
of sufficient information significantly reduced the risk of depression.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results demonstrate the severe negative
psychological impact of the increase in workload resulting from COVID-19 and
suggest the importance of psychological support for occupational therapists, such
as the provision of sufficient information by the workplace. What This Article
Adds: This study highlights the importance of providing psychological support for
occupational therapists worldwide.
