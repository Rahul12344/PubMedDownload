BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused
overwhelming challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Healthcare workers
(HCWs) have faced particular challenges: being exposed to the coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 and caring for patients having a new and potentially life-threatening 
disease. The aim of this study was to explore how HCWs in the Swedish healthcare 
system perceived their work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020.
METHODS: Focus group discussions and interviews with HCWs were performed from
June to October 2020 in one Swedish healthcare region. A purposeful sampling
approach was used to select a variety of professions (physicians, nurses, nurse
aides and cleaners) and workplaces (hospital inpatient wards, emergency
department, nursing home and home care service). Qualitative content analysis was
used for data analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 51 HCWs participated in eight focus group discussions and one 
HCW participated in an individual interview. The content analysis identified two 
main categories: 'Concerns about the risk of infection and transmission of
infection to others', and 'Transition from chaos to managing in a new and
challenging work situation'. The findings revealed how HCWs perceived working
conditions, including experiences of fear for personal health, confusion and
uncertainty regarding personal protective equipment and infection prevention and 
control (PPE/IPC), and fear of infecting others. Both fearful and appreciating
attitudes were achieved from the surrounding community. Helpful strategies for
transition from chaos to control were lifted i.e. present and supportive
leadership, and finding comfort and strength in the working team. Both
helplessness and meaningfulness were described when caring for COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides unique insights into HCWs experiences of an
extremely challenging work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19
pandemic, including feelings of stress and insecurity in a chaotic and hazardous 
working environment. But there is also mitigation of these challenges and even
positive experiences including feelings of safety and meaningfulness. To enhance 
safety among HCWs in healthcare crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the
findings highlight the importance of avoiding confusion about PPE/IPC, having a
supportive healthcare leadership and ensuring accurate information provision
about virus transmission to the public.
