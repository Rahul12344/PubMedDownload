The presence of latent human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in quiescent memory
CD4 + T cells represents a major barrier to viral eradication. Proliferation of
memory CD4 + T cells is the primary mechanism that leads to persistence of the
latent reservoir, despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Memory CD4 + T 
cells are long-lived and can proliferate through two mechanisms: homeostatic
proliferation via γc-cytokine stimulation or antigen-driven proliferation.
Therefore, therapeutic modalities that perturb homeostatic and antigen-driven
proliferation, combined with ART, represent promising strategies to reduce the
latent reservoir. In this study, we investigated a library of FDA-approved
oncology drugs to determine their ability to inhibit homeostatic and/or
antigen-driven proliferation. We confirmed potential hits by evaluating their
effects on proliferation in memory CD4 + T cells from people living with HIV-1 on
ART (PLWH) and interrogated downstream signaling of γc-cytokine stimulation. We
found that dasatinib and ponatinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and trametinib, a
MEK inhibitor, reduced both homeostatic and antigen-driven proliferationby >65%, 
with a reduction in viability <45%, ex vivo. In memory CD4 + T cells from PLWH,
only dasatinib restricted both homeostatic and antigen-driven proliferation and
prevented spontaneous rebound, consistent with promoting a smaller reservoir
size. We show that dasatinib restricts IL-7 induced proliferation through STAT5
phosphorylation inhibition. Our results establish that the anti-cancer agent
dasatinib is an exciting candidate to be used as an anti-proliferative drug in a 
clinical trial, since it efficiently blocks proliferation and iswell tolerated in
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
