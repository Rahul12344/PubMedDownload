SARS-CoV-2 infection can impact the physical, cognitive, mental health of
patients, especially in those recovered in intensive care units. Moreover, it was
proved that the effects of the virus may persist for weeks or months. The term
long-COVID or post-COVID syndrome is commonly used for indicating a variety of
physical and psychological symptoms that continue after the resolution of the
acute phase. This narrative review is aimed at providing an updated overview of
the impact of physical, cognitive, and psychological health disorders in COVID-19
survivors, by summarizing the data already published in literature in the last
year. Studies cited were found through PubMed searches. We also presented an
overview of the post-COVID-19 health consequences on three important aspects:
nutritional status, neurological disorders, and physical health. Moreover, to
activate a correct health planning policy, a multidisciplinary approach for
addressing the post- COVID-19 issue, has been proposed. Finally, the involvement 
of health professionals is necessary even after the pandemic, to reduce expected 
post-pandemic psychosocial responses and mental health disorders.
