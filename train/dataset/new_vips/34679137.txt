BACKGROUND: Elevated D-dimer levels have been observed in COVID-19 and are of
prognostic value, but have not been compared to an appropriate control group.
METHODS: Observational cohort study including emergency patients with suspected
or confirmed COVID-19. Logistic regression defined the association of D-dimer
levels, COVID-19 positivity, age, and gender with 30-day-mortality.
RESULTS: 953 consecutive patients (median age 58, 43% women) presented with
suspected COVID-19: 12 (7.4%) patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection died, 
compared with 28 (3.5%) patients without SARS-CoV-2-infection. Overall, most
(56%) patients had elevated D-dimer levels (≥0.5mg/l). Age (OR 1.07, CI
1.05-1.10), D-dimer levels ≥0.5mg/l (OR 2.44, CI 0.98-7.39), and COVID-19 (OR
2.79, CI 1.28-5.80) were associated with 30-day-mortality.
CONCLUSION: D-dimer levels are effective prognosticators in both patient groups.
