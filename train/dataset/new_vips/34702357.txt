BACKGROUND: Emerging reports are describing stroke in young, otherwise healthy
patients with coronavirus disease 2019, consistent with the theory that some of
the most serious complications of coronavirus disease 2019 are due to a systemic 
coagulopathy. However, the relevance of both the severity of coronavirus disease 
2019 illness and established vascular risk factors in these younger patients is
unknown, as reports are inconsistent.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe a 39-year-old white male, who died after
presenting simultaneously with a malignant large-vessel cerebrovascular infarct
and a critical coronavirus disease 2019 respiratory illness. Doppler ultrasound
revealed evidence of carotid plaque thrombosis. Blood tests revealed evidence of 
undiagnosed diabetes mellitus; however, the patient was otherwise healthy, fit,
and active.
CONCLUSIONS: This unique case highlights a possible interaction between
established risk factors and large-vessel thrombosis in young patients with
coronavirus disease 2019, and informs future research into the benefits of
anticoagulation in these patients.
