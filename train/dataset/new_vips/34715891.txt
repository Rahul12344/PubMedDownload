Glioma represents a fast proliferating and highly invasive brain tumor which is
resistant to current therapies and invariably recurs. Despite some advancements
in anti-glioma therapies, patients' prognosis remains poor. Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) act as the first line of defense in the immune system being the detectors 
of those associated with bacteria, viruses, and danger signals. In the glioma
microenvironment, TLRs are expressed on both immune and tumor cells, playing dual
roles eliciting antitumoral (innate and adaptive immunity) and protumoral (cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and glioma stem cell maintenance) responses. 
Up to date, several TLR-targeting therapies have been developed aiming at glioma 
bulk and stem cells, infiltrating immune cells, the immune checkpoint axis, among
others. While some TLR agonists exhibited survival benefit in clinical trials, it
attracts more attention when they are involved in combinatorial treatment with
radiation, chemotherapy, immune vaccination, and immune checkpoint inhibition in 
glioma treatment. TLR agonists can be used as immune modulators to enhance the
efficacy of other treatment, to avoid dose accumulation, and what brings more
interests is that they can potentiate immune checkpoint delayed resistance to
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade by upregulating PD-1/PD-L1 overexpression, thus unleash
powerful antitumor responses when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Herein, we focus on recent developments and clinical trials exploring TLR-based
treatment to provide a picture of the relationship between TLR and glioma and
their implications for immunotherapy.
