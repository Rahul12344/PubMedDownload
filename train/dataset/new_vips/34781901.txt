BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant threats to both the
physical and psychological health of healthcare workers working in the front-line
combating COVID-19. However, studies regarding the medium to long term impact of 
COVID-19 on mental health among healthcare workers are limited. Therefore, we
conducted this cross-sectional survey to investigate the prevalence, factors and 
impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in healthcare workers exposed to 
COVID-19 8 months after the end of the outbreak in Wuhan, China.
METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was delivered as a link via the communication 
application WeChat to those healthcare workers who worked at several
COVID-19 units during the outbreak (from December 2019 to April 2020) in Wuhan,
China. The questionnaire included questions on social-demographic data, the
post-traumatic stress disorder checklist-5 (PCL-5), the family care index
questionnaire (Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection and Resolve, APGAR),
and the quality-of-life scale (QOL). The prevalence, risk and protective factors,
and impact of PTSD on healthcare workers were subsequently analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 659 participants, 90 healthcare workers were still suffering
from PTSD 8 months after the end of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, in which
avoidance and negative impact were the most affected dimensions. Suffering from
chronic disease, experiencing social isolation, and job dissatisfaction came up
as independent risk factors for PTSD, while obtaining COVID-19 related
information at an appropriate frequency, good family function, and working in
well-prepared mobile cabin hospitals served as protective factors. The impact of 
PTSD on COVID-19 exposed healthcare workers was apparent by shortened sleeping
time, feeling of loneliness, poorer quality of life and intention to resign.
CONCLUSIONS: Eight months after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the
level of PTSD in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 was still high. Apart
from the commonly recognized risk factors, comorbid chronic disease was
identified as a new independent risk factor for developing PTSD. For countries
where the pandemic is still ongoing or in case of future outbreaks of new
communicable diseases, this study may contribute to preventing cases of PTSD in
healthcare workers exposed to infectious diseases under such circumstances.
