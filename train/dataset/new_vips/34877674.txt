The COVID-19 pandemic sparked rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.
However, emerging variants pose the risk for target dropout and false-negative
results secondary to primer/probe binding site (PBS) mismatches. The Agena
MassARRAY® SARS-CoV-2 Panel combines RT-PCR and MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry to
probe for five targets across N and ORF1ab genes, which provides a robust
platform to accommodate PBS mismatches in divergent viruses. Herein, we utilize a
deidentified dataset of 1,262 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from Mount Sinai
Health System (New York City) from December 2020 through April 2021 to evaluate
target results and corresponding sequencing data. Overall, the level of PBS
mismatches was greater in specimens with target dropout. Of specimens with N3
target dropout, 57% harbored an A28095T substitution that is highly-specific for 
the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of concern. These data highlight the benefit of
redundancy in target design and the potential for target performance to
illuminate the dynamics of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. This article is
