Background: The Public Health Agency of Canada estimates that about 87% of
persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Canada have been
diagnosed, which is well below the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
target to have 95% of HIV-positive persons diagnosed. Research has shown that HIV
self-testing may help increase such diagnoses, especially among the populations
who are most affected by HIV. The objective of the study was to determine the
uptake and diagnosis outcomes associated with free HIV self-testing.
Methods: We developed the first online mailout free HIV self-testing program in
Canada and implemented it in Ottawa. This project ran through the website,
www.GetaKit.ca. We intended to recruit 150-400 participants over a 6-12-month
period, estimating that this number would yield between 0-1 positive test results
(expected positivity rate of 0.08%).
Results: Between July 20, 2020 and April 1, 2021, 1,268 people accessed the
GetaKit website and verified their eligibility. In total, 600 persons were
eligible and 405 ordered an HIV kit. Of those who ordered a kit, 399 completed a 
baseline survey. Overall, 71% of these participants were members of HIV priority 
groups. For test results, 228 persons reported test results, with one being
positive, for a positivity rate of 0.24% overall and 0.44% of reported results.
These rates exceed that normally observed in Ottawa.
Conclusion: Self-testing of HIV can be effectively delivered through a website.
Such an intervention will also be used by persons with undiagnosed infections and
appears to do so at a rate higher than that observed by other means of testing.
Self-testing of HIV may therefore help Canada achieve the United Nations 95-95-95
targets.
