BACKGROUND: For patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B 
virus (HBV), HCV treatment with direct-acting antivirals can lead to HBV
reactivation. We evaluated HBV reactivation during ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
treatment and 108-week follow-up.
METHODS: In Taiwan, 111 patients with HCV genotype 1 or 2 and HBV received
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90mg/400mg) once-daily for 12 weeks. HBV virologic
reactivation was defined as postbaseline increase in HBV DNA from either <lower
limit of quantification (LLOQ, 20 IU/mL) to ≥LLOQ or ≥LLOQ to >1 log10 IU/mL. HBV
clinical reactivation was HBV virologic reactivation with alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) >2x upper limit of normal (ULN). Factors associated with
development of HBV virologic or clinical reactivation were evaluated with
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: All patients (100%, 111/111) maintained HCV suppression through 108
weeks after treatment. HBV virologic reactivation occurred in 73% of patients
(81/111). Clinical reactivation occurred in 9% (10/111). The majority of HBV
virologic reactivations (86%, 70/81) occurred by follow-up week 12 while clinical
reactivation was generally more delayed. Eight (7%, 8/111) initiated HBV therapy.
In regression analyses, baseline HBV DNA and HBsAg levels were associated with
HBV virologic reactivation and baseline ALT, HBV DNA, and HBsAg levels were
associated with HBV clinical reactivation.
CONCLUSION: Among HCV/HBV coinfected patients treated with direct-acting
antivirals for HCV, HBV virologic reactivation occurred in a majority of patients
during treatment and follow-up. In most patients, HBV virologic reactivation was 
asymptomatic; only a small proportion initiated HBV treatment. Notably, clinical 
reactivation may still occur >3 months after end of therapy.
