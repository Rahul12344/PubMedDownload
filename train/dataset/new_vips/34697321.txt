A panel of influenza virus-like sequences were recently documented in fish and
amphibians. Of these, the Wuhan spiny eel influenza virus (WSEIV) was found to
phylogenetically cluster with influenza B viruses as a sister clade. Influenza B 
viruses have been documented to circulate only in humans, with certain virus
isolates found in harbor seals. It is therefore interesting that a similar virus 
was potentially found in fish. Here we characterize the putative hemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins of the WSEIV. Functionally, we 
show that the WSEIV NA-like protein has sialidase activity comparable to
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza B virus NA, making it a bona fide neuraminidase
that is sensitive to NA inhibitors. We tested the functionality of the HA by
addressing the receptor specificity, stability, preferential airway protease
cleavage, and fusogenicity. We show highly specific binding to monosialic
ganglioside 2 (GM2) and fusogenicity at a range of different pH conditions. In
addition, we found limited antigenic conservation of the WSEIV HA and NA relative
to the B/Malaysia/2506/2004 virus HA and NA. In summary, we perform a functional 
and antigenic characterization of the glycoproteins of WSEIV to assess if it is
indeed a bona fide influenza virus potentially circulating in ray-finned fish.
