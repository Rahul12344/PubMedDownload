The impact of plum pox virus (PPV) on sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.)
productivity has been studied by comparing the yield of PPV-infected and PPV-free
fruit-bearing trees. A total of 152 16- to 17-year-old trees of nine cultivars
and hybrids were surveyed in the production orchards (cultivar collection and
hybrid testing plots) in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. Sixty trees tested
positive for PPV using ELISA and RT-PCR. Among them, 58 PPV isolates belonged to 
the strain C and the other 2 isolates to the strain CV. For the cultivars
Sevastyanovskaya, Shakirovskaya, hybrids 88-2 and 80-8, the average (2012 to
2019) productivity of infected trees was 38% to 45% lower than for PPV-free trees
of the same cultivar or hybrid. No ilarviruses (prunus necrotic ringspot virus,
prune dwarf virus, apple mosaic virus, American plum line pattern virus) were
detected in PPV-infected trees, suggesting that reduced cherry productivity was
attributed to the PPV infection. Thus, it was shown for the first time that PPV
can reduce the productivity of at least some sour cherry cultivars and hybrids,
and strain C isolates are responsible for crop losses.
