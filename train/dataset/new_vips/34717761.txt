BACKGROUND: We defined the frequency of respiratory community-acquired bacterial 
co-infection in patients with COVID-19, i.e. patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 
PCR or a COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) score ≥ 4, based on a
complete clinical assessment, including prior antibiotic use, clinical
characteristics, inflammatory markers, chest computed tomography (CT) results and
microbiological test results.
METHODS: Our retrospective study was conducted within a cohort of prospectively
included patients admitted for COVID-19 in our tertiary medical centres between
1-3-2020 and 1-6-2020. A multidisciplinary study team developed a diagnostic
protocol to retrospectively categorize patients as unlikely, possible or probable
bacterial co-infection based on clinical, radiological and microbiological
parameters in the first 72 h of admission. Within the three categories, we
summarized patient characteristics and antibiotic consumption.
RESULTS: Among 281 included COVID-19 patients, bacterial co-infection was
classified as unlikely in 233 patients (82.9%), possible in 35 patients (12.4%)
and probable in 3 patients (1.1%). Ten patients (3.6%) could not be classified
due to inconclusive data. Within 72 h of hospital admission, 81% of the total
study population and 78% of patients classified as unlikely bacterial
co-infection received antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients are unlikely to have a respiratory
community-acquired bacterial co-infection. This study underpins recommendations
for restrictive use of antibacterial drugs in patients with COVID-19.
