Background: While lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19 indisputably
mitigated virus transmission, the aim of this longitudinal study was to establish
indirect effects on vulnerable young people's mental well-being and physical
activity (PA) levels.
Methods: Surveys conducted at time 1 (February 2020), and time 2 (April 2020)
comprised of the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the Rosenberg
Self-Esteem Scale, and self-reported moderate and vigorous PA levels. Repeated
measures analyses established changes pre-post lockdown restrictions, and
differences between sub-groups. Associations between changes in well-being,
self-esteem and PA over time were explored through further regression analyses.
Results: 65 respondents completed the survey at time 1, and 50 respondent at time
2. Wellbeing increased significantly over time, yet remained significantly lower 
than the population average. Self-esteem increased significantly post-lockdown,
however remained significantly lower for females, compared with males. Overall,
PA levels increased-whereby 'inactive' participants at time 1 reported
significant increases in moderate and total activity levels at time 2. Increased 
PA levels significantly predicted increased well-being: F(1, 48) = 4.15, p < .05;
while participants who had become less active accounted for 69.2% with low
self-esteem at time 2.
Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased PA accounted for improved mental
well-being, while decreased PA was associated with reduced levels of self-esteem.
PA may represent a modifiable means of mitigating risk, and promoting resilience 
for vulnerable young people experiencing adverse conditions.
