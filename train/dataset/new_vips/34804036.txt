Seemingly redundant in function, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5
(MDA5) and toll-like receptor- 3 (TLR3) both sense RNA viruses and induce type I 
interferon (IFN-I). Herein, we demonstrate that changes in sensing of the same
virus by MDA5 and TLR3 can lead to distinct signatures of IFN-α and IFN-ß
resulting in different disease outcomes. Specifically, infection with a
diabetogenic islet β cell-tropic strain of coxsackievirus (CB4) results in
diabetes protection under reduced MDA5 signaling conditions while reduced TLR3
function retains diabetes susceptibility. Regulating the induction of IFN-I at
the site of virus infection creates a local site of interferonopathy leading to
loss of T cell regulation and induction of autoimmune diabetes. We have not
demonstrated another way to prevent T1D in the NOD mouse, rather we believe this 
work has provided compounding evidence for a specific control of IFN-I to drive a
myriad of responses ranging from virus clearance to onset of autoimmune diabetes.
