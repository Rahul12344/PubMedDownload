The spread of epidemics and diseases is known to exhibit chaotic dynamics; a fact
confirmed by many developed mathematical models. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no attempt to realize any of these chaotic models in analog or digital
electronic form has been reported in the literature. In this work, we report on
the efficient FPGA implementations of three different virus spreading models and 
one disease progress model. In particular, the Ebola, Influenza, and COVID-19
virus spreading models in addition to a Cancer disease progress model are first
numerically analyzed for parameter sensitivity via bifurcation diagrams.
Subsequently and despite the large number of parameters and large number of
multiplication (or division) operations, these models are efficiently implemented
on FPGA platforms using fixed-point architectures. Detailed FPGA design process, 
hardware architecture and timing analysis are provided for three of the studied
models (Ebola, Influenza, and Cancer) on an Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA 
chip. All models are also implemented on a high performance Xilinx Artix-7
XC7A100TCSG324 FPGA for comparison of the needed hardware resources. Experimental
results showing real-time control of the chaotic dynamics are presented.
