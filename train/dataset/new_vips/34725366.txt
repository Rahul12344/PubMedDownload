The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by multiple factors, including 
the viral, host genetics, age, and comorbidities. This study investigated the
association between prognostic factors and disease outcomes of patients infected 
by SARS-CoV-2 with multiple S protein mutations. Fifty-one COVID-19 patients were
recruited in this study. Whole-genome sequencing of 170 full-genomes of
SARS-CoV-2 was conducted with the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Most patients (47%)
had mild symptoms of COVID-19 followed by moderate (19.6%), no symptoms (13.7%), 
severe (4%), and critical (2%). Mortality was found in 13.7% of the COVID-19
patients. There was a significant difference between the age of hospitalized
patients (53.4 ± 18 years) and the age of non-hospitalized patients (34.6 ± 19)
(p = 0.001). The patients' hospitalization was strongly associated with
hypertension, diabetes, and anticoagulant and were strongly significant with the 
OR of 17 (95% CI 2-144; p = 0.001), 4.47 (95% CI 1.07-18.58; p = 0.039), and
27.97 (95% CI 1.54-507.13; p = 0.02), respectively; while the patients' mortality
was significantly correlated with patients' age, anticoagulant, steroid, and
diabetes, with OR of 8.44 (95% CI 1.5-47.49; p = 0.016), 46.8 (95% CI
4.63-472.77; p = 0.001), 15.75 (95% CI 2-123.86; p = 0.009), and 8.5 (95% CI
1.43-50.66; p = 0.019), respectively. This study found the clade: L (2%), GH
(84.3%), GR (11.7%), and O (2%). Besides the D614G mutation, we found L5F
(18.8%), V213A (18.8%), and S689R (8.3%). No significant association between
multiple S protein mutations and the patients' hospitalization or mortality.
Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension and anticoagulant were the
significant factors influencing the hospitalization and mortality of patients
with COVID-19 with an OR of 17.06 (95% CI 2.02-144.36; p = 0.009) and 46.8 (95%
CI 4.63-472.77; p = 0.001), respectively. Moreover, the multiple S protein
mutations almost reached a strong association with patients' hospitalization
(p = 0.07). We concluded that hypertension and anticoagulant therapy have a
significant impact on COVID-19 outcomes. This study also suggests that multiple S
protein mutations may impact the COVID-19 outcomes. This further emphasized the
significance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants through genomic surveillance,
particularly those that may impact the COVID-19 outcomes.
