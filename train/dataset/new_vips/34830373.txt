We previously demonstrated that mast cells expressing HLA-G are associated with
regions of hepatitis C virus-induced liver fibrosis. Here, we aimed to determine 
whether HLA-G expression in mast cells is specific to viral etiology, the liver, 
or to the general process of fibrosis. We enumerated HLA-G+ cells and mast cells 
by the immunohistochemistry of (i) liver blocks from 41 cases of alcoholic
cirrhosis, (ii) 10 of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and (iii) 10 of renal 
fibrosis. The nature of the HLA-G+ cells was specified by multiplex
immunofluorescence using software. More than half of all HLA-G+ cells were mast
cells in fibrotic areas of alcoholic cirrhosis and IPF. In the kidneys, subjected
to fibrosis, the HLA-G+ cells were indeed mast cells but could not be counted.
Moreover, in certain cases of the liver and lung, we observed a number of
cellular nodes, which were secondary or tertiary follicles, in which HLA-G was
highly expressed by B lymphocytes. In conclusion, HLA-G+ mast cells could be
observed in the fibrotic regions of all organs studied. Previous studies suggest 
a protective role for HLA-G+ mast cells against inflammation and fibrosis. The
observed follicles with B lymphocytes that express HLA-G may also reinforce their
antifibrotic role.
