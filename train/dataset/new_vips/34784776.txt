Emerging epidemics and local infection clusters are initially prone to stochastic
effects that can substantially impact the early epidemic trajectory. While
numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established
epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are
comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results on the size of
the epidemic over time, and derive new results to elucidate the early dynamics of
an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We show that the
initial growth of epidemics that eventually take off is accelerated by
stochasticity. As an application, we compute the distribution of the first
detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on
testing effort, and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha
detected in September 2020 first appeared in the UK early August 2020. We also
compute a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before they exceed a given
threshold size. These results improve our theoretical understanding of early
epidemics and will be useful for the study and control of local infectious
disease clusters.
