Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is an RNA virus that requires the presence of
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to propagate into hepatocytes, with Genotype 
I being more prevalent globally. However, the prevalence of HDV genotypes in
Taiwan is unknown. Accordingly, a cohort including 24 chronic HBV patients who
received nucleos(t)ides (NUCs) between January 2002 and July 2018 was used to
determine HDV genotypes and genotype specific serological association in chronic 
HBV carriers. HDV-positive genotypes in 18/24 (75%) males and 6/24 (25%) females 
were identified among chronic HBV patients. Viremia was lower in HDV-IV patients 
than in patients affected with other HDV genotypes (1.34 log10 copies/mL vs. 3.30
log10 copies/mL; p = 0.009). A logistics regression analysis revealed that HDV-IV
was inversely proportional to HDV RNA (odds ratio [OR]/95% confidence intervals
[CI]: 0.370/0.164-0.830; p = 0.017). The serologic association study indicated
lower levels of creatinine (p = 0.047) and HDV-RNA (p = 0.009) in the HDV-IV
group than the non-HDV-IV group but did not indicate any significant differences 
in the AST, ALT, bilirubin levels or other laboratory test factors. The three
genotypes evident in Taiwan were HDV-I (4/24, 16.7%), HDV-II (6/24, 25.0%), and
HDV-IV (14/24, 58.3%), and HDV-IV is the predominant HDV genotype in Taiwan.
These results anticipate a clear understanding of HDV genotype serological
association in chronic HBV carriers.
