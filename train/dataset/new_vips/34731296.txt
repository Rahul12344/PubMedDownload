From the beginning of pandemic, more than 240 million people have been infected
with a death rate higher than 2%. Indeed, the current exit strategy involving the
spreading of vaccines must be combined with progress in effective treatment
development. This scenario is sadly supported by the vaccine's immune activation 
time and the inequalities in the global immunization schedule. Bringing the
crises under control means providing the world population with accessible and
impactful new therapeutics. We screened a natural product library that contains a
unique collection of 2370 natural products into the binding site of the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro).
According to the docking score and to the interaction at the active site, three
phenylethanoid glycosides (forsythiaside A, isoacteoside, and verbascoside) were 
selected. In order to provide better insight into the atomistic interaction and
test the impact of the three selected compounds at the binding site, we resorted 
to a half microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation. As a result, we are
showing that forsythiaside A is the most stable molecule and it is likely to
possess the highest inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Phenylethanoid
glycosides also have been reported to have both protease and kinase activity.
This kinase inhibitory activity is very beneficial in fighting viruses inside the
body as kinases are required for viral entry, metabolism, and/or reproduction.
The dual activity (kinase/protease) of phenylethanoid glycosides makes them very 
promising anit-COVID-19 agents.
