Background/Αim: The relationship of herpes viruses and herpes zoster (HZ) with
dementia and Alzheimer's disease is controversial. This study evaluated the
relationship between HZ vaccination and cognitive impairment.PATIENTS AND
METHODS: We used data from The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
to evaluate the relationship between HZ vaccination and cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Using BRFSS 2017 data, we assessed HZ vaccination status in 275 subjects
whose social activities were hampered by disorientation or memory loss. 61.6% of 
vaccinated subjects (n=61) and 46.6% of unvaccinated subjects (n=82) never had
social activities hampered by disorientation or memory loss. The result is
significant (p=0.025, two- sided Fisher exact test). The results of multivariate 
linear regression analysis, considering social activities hampered by
disorientation or memory loss as a dependent variable, and vaccination (yes or
no), sex, and education level as independent variables, showed that the effect of
vaccination--reducing risk of social activities hampered by disorientation or
memory loss--was significant (p=0.03).
CONCLUSION: Our finding that HZ vaccination reduces the risk of dementia is
consistent with the link between viruses and AD. Herpes viruses-induced
reactivation of embryologic pathways silenced at birth could be one of the
pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease.
