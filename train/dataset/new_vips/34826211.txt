SPINK6 was identified in human skin as a cellular inhibitor of serine proteases
of the KLK family. Airway serine proteases are required to cleave hemagglutinin
(HA) of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to initiate an infection in the human airway. 
We hypothesized that SPINK6 may inhibit common airway serine proteases and
restrict IAV activation. We demonstrate that SPINK6 specifically suppresses the
proteolytic activity of HAT and KLK5, HAT- and KLK5-mediated HA cleavage, and
restricts virus maturation and replication. SPINK6 constrains the activation of
progeny virions and impairs viral growth; and vice versa, blocking endogenous
SPINK6 enhances HA cleavage and viral growth in physiological-relevant human
airway organoids where SPINK6 is intrinsically expressed. In IAV-infected mice,
SPINK6 significantly suppresses viral growth and improves mouse survival.
Notably, individuals carrying the higher SPINK6 expression allele were protected 
from human H7N9 infection. Collectively, SPINK6 is a novel host inhibitor of
serine proteases in the human airway and restricts IAV activation.
