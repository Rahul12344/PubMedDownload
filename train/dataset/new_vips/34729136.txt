Background: Preventing cancer is better than treating or curing it. Cancer
prevention ensures reduced physical, emotional, financial burden to the
individual.
Methods: The focus of the preventive oncology unit at Healthcare Global (HCG)
Enterprise Limited, Bangalore, India, is to increase the understanding of how
lifestyle and risk of cancer are related. It also focusses on screening of normal
individuals for estimating their risk of developing cancer, which in-turn can
lead to earlier detection, improved treatment and outcomes. This unique endeavor 
started one year back, provides counseling and vaccination services for HPV
(Human Papilloma Virus) and HBV (Hepatitis B Virus). Our outreach initiatives in 
collaboration with the State and City health Departments include screening camps,
and awareness sessions focusing on HPV and HBV vaccination.
Results: The focus of research is in the areas of cancer epidemiology,
prevention, screening, and control. Such research involves a multidisciplinary
approach involving the fields of epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioral science,
nutrition, and basic science.
Conclusion: This novel endeavor at a tertiary cancer hospital in a Developing
Country is aimed at preventing the development or progression of the malignant
cancer process.
