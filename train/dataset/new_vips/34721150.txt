The Italian state adopted serious safety measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic
in the year 2020. The lockdown was associated with negative psychological
consequences in healthy populations, mostly in terms of anxiety, distress,
depression, and even traumatic symptoms. This longitudinal study aimed at briefly
documenting the psychological impact among an Italian sample, in terms of worry
and its impact on psychological well-being levels, of the first wave of COVID-19,
taking into account the changes in the lockdown scenario. A three-time follow-up 
survey was administered to 177 subjects (Female: 78%, M age = 36.33), during
(T0), at the end (T1), and 3 months after the end of the first lockdown (T2).
Since the first wave of COVID-19, results showed a decrease in worry and the
perception of virus diffusion's controllability over time while psychological
well-being increased. Furthermore, factors such as personality traits
(neuroticism and agreeableness) and dysfunctional coping strategies predicted
increases in worry levels at the end of the lockdown and 3 months after in the
Italian context. However, worry levels during and at the end of the lockdown did 
not predict well-being levels 3 months after the end of the lockdown. Based on
these findings, mental health policymakers should design tailored interventions
able to improve the perception of virus diffusion management, as well as address 
the psychological needs of Italian citizens and support it, including a plan for 
the follow-up evaluation.
