The General Organization of the Veterinary Services in Egypt has adopted a
sheeppox vaccination policy to control lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle. Over
the course of the last two years, recurrent outbreaks were reported, with animals
showing severe clinical signs and consequentially higher fatalities than that of 
cases reported in previous LSD outbreaks. A total of 1050 cattle showing typical 
clinical signs suggestive of LSD were clinically and pathologically investigated 
during 2017-2018. Skin nodules were collected and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV)
was screened in collected skin samples using PCR for the RPO-30 gene.
Furthermore, the entire P32 protein coding gene was sequenced. Histopathology and
immunohistochemistry of the skin nodules were also conducted. The obtained
results showed an overall mortality rate of 6.86%. LSDV was confirmed in all the 
examined nodules as evidenced by immunohistochemistry and positive PCR
amplification of the RPO30 gene. Sequencing analysis of the P32 gene revealed a
highly conserved nature and genetic stability of the LSDV. The results of the
present study show that the current vaccination protocol was not effective for a 
multitude of reasons. These results also serve as evidence for a strong
recommendation of an amendment of homologous vaccine use aside from a complete
coverage of cattle populations in order to reduce the incidence of LSD among
cattle population in Egypt.
