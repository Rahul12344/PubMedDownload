BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are characterized by a
dysregulated inflammatory and thrombotic state, leading to devastating
complications with increased morbidity and mortality rates.
SUMMARY: In this review article, we present the available evidence regarding the 
impact of inflammation on platelet activation in atherosclerosis. Key messages:
In the context of a dysfunctional vascular endothelium, structural alterations by
means of endothelial glycocalyx thinning or functional modifications through
impaired NO bioavailability and increased levels of von Willebrand factor result 
in platelet activation. Moreover, neutrophil-derived mediators, as well as
neutrophil extracellular traps formation, have been implicated in the process of 
platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte aggregation. The role of
pro-inflammatory cytokines is also critical since their receptors are also
situated in platelets while TNF-Î± has also been found to induce inflammatory,
metabolic, and bone marrow changes. Additionally, important progress has been
made towards novel concepts of the interaction between inflammation and platelet 
activation, such as the toll-like receptors, myeloperoxidase, and platelet
factor-4. The accumulating evidence is especially important in the era of the
coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, characterized by an excessive inflammatory
burden leading to thrombotic complications, partially mediated by platelet
activation. Lastly, recent advances in anti-inflammatory therapies point towards 
an anti-thrombotic effect secondary to diminished platelet activation.
