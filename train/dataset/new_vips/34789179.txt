BACKGROUND: Current assays for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on time consuming, costly and laboratory based
methods for virus isolation, purification and removing inhibitors. To address
this limitation, we propose a simple method for testing RNA from nasopharyngeal
swab samples that bypasses the RNA purification step.
METHODS: In the current project, we have described two extraction-free reverse
transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 by using E gene and RdRp gene as the targets.
RESULTS: Here, results showed that reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification assays with 88.4% sensitive (95% CI: 74.9-96.1%) and 67.4%
sensitive (95% CI: 51.5-80.9%) for E gene and RdRp gene, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Without the need of RNA purification, our developed RT-LAMP assays
for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab samples could be
turned into alternatives to qRT-PCR for rapid screening.
