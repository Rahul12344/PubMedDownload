The hustle and bustle of the planet Earth have come to a halt thanks to the novel
coronavirus. The virus has affected approximately 219 million people globally;
taken the lives of 4.55 million patients as of September 2021; and created an
ambiance of fear, social distancing, and economic instability. The purpose of
this review article is to trace the historical origin and evolution of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is highly
contagious with a unique feature of rapid mutations-the scientific research is
paving the way for discoveries regarding novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
diagnosis, features, prevention, and vaccination. The connections between the
coronavirus pandemic and dental practices are essential because COVID-19 is
transmitted by aerosols, fomites, and respiratory droplets, which are also
produced during dental procedures, putting both the patient and the dentist at
risk. The main emphasis of this paper is to highlight the psychological,
economic, and social impact of this pandemic on dental practices throughout the
world and under what circumstances and guidelines can dental health care be
provided. In the current situation of the pandemic, an appropriate screening tool
must be established either by using rapid molecular testing or saliva
point-of-care technology, which will be effective in identifying as well as
isolating the potential contacts and carriers in hopes to contain and mitigate
infection. The blessing in disguise is that this virus has united the leaders,
scientists, health care providers, and people of all professions from all around 
the world to fight against a common enemy.
