Hepatitis D (delta, δ) virus (HDV) was discovered more than 40 years ago, but the
understanding of its origin and evolution is poor. This is mainly due to the
lack, until recently, of data on the existence of any viruses similar to HDV. The
discovery in recent years of sequences of new delta-like agents in a wide range
of vertebrate (Vertebrata) and invertebrate (Invertebrata) species has
facilitated a revision of views on the origin of HDV and contributed to
understanding the place of this unique virus among other animals' viral agents.
The purpose of this review is to analyze the latest published data on new
delta-like agents and their biological characteristics.
