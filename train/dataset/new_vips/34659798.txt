As the COVID-19 pandemic swept through an immunologically naïve human population,
academics and public health professionals scrambled to establish methods and
platforms for genomic surveillance and data sharing. This offered a rare
opportunity to study the ecology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of
the ongoing pandemic. Here, we use population genetic and phylogenetic
methodology to characterize the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstruct
patterns of virus introductions and local transmission in Norway against this
backdrop. The analyses demonstrated that the epidemic in Norway was largely
import driven and characterized by the repeated introduction, establishment, and 
suppression of new transmission lineages. This pattern changed with the arrival
of the B.1.1.7 lineage, which was able to establish a stable presence concomitant
with the imposition of severe border restrictions.
