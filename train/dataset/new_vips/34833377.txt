There are a number of potential implications for the field of Alzheimer's disease
(AD) stemming from the global spread of "SARS-COV-2". Many studies that were
conducted by Cleveland Clinic researchers identified a link between COVID-19
infection and brain abnormalities seen in people with AD. This article explains
the association between COVID-19 and AD and how people with AD are affected by
COVID-19, whether directly or indirectly. First, this article begins by
explaining AD and its types, then giving an overview about COVID-19, its symptoms
and the associated complications. Then, direct and indirect consequences of
COVID-19 on people experiencing AD are discussed briefly. Some management
strategies are recommended at the end of this article in addition to a future
perspective on this topic. This article concludes by summarizing the main points 
mentioned about the association between COVID-19 and AD.
