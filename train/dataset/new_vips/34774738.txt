Cytokines produced by T helper cells (Th cells) have essential roles in the
body's defense against viruses. Type 1 T helper (Th1) cells are essential for the
host defense toward intracellular pathogens while T helper type 2 (Th2) cells are
considered to be critical for the helminthic parasites' elimination swine-origin 
influenza A (H1N1) virus, a disease led to an epidemic in 2009 and rapidly spread
globally via human-to-human transmission. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has
caused a global pandemic in 2020 and is a serious threat to the public health.
Pulmonary immunopathology is the leading cause of death during influenza and
SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and pandemics. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 cause high levels of
cytokines in the lung. Both inadequate levels and high levels of specific
cytokines can have side effects. In this literature review article, we want to
compare the Th1 and Th2 cells responses in SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1.
