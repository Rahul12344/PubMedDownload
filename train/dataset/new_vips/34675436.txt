Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can damage cerebral small vessels and cause
neurological symptoms. Here we describe structural changes in cerebral small
vessels of patients with COVID-19 and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying
the vascular pathology. In brains of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals and animal models, we found an
increased number of empty basement membrane tubes, so-called string vessels
representing remnants of lost capillaries. We obtained evidence that brain
endothelial cells are infected and that the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro)
cleaves NEMO, the essential modulator of nuclear factor-κB. By ablating NEMO,
Mpro induces the death of human brain endothelial cells and the occurrence of
string vessels in mice. Deletion of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3,
a mediator of regulated cell death, blocks the vessel rarefaction and disruption 
of the blood-brain barrier due to NEMO ablation. Importantly, a pharmacological
inhibitor of RIPK signaling prevented the Mpro-induced microvascular pathology.
Our data suggest RIPK as a potential therapeutic target to treat the
neuropathology of COVID-19.
