Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is rarely 
fatal in children and young people (CYP, <18 years old), but quantifying the risk
of death is challenging because CYP are often infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting
no or minimal symptoms. To distinguish between CYP who died as a result of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who died of another cause but were coincidentally 
infected with the virus, we undertook a clinical review of all CYP deaths with a 
positive SARS-CoV-2 test from March 2020 to February 2021. The predominant
SARS-CoV-2 variants were wild-type and Alpha. Here we show that, of 12,023,568
CYP living in England, 3,105 died, including 61 who were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Of these deaths, 25 were due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (mortality rate, two per
million), including 22 due to coronavirus disease 2019-the clinical disease
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection-and 3 were due to pediatric inflammatory
multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2. In total, 99.995% of 
CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test survived. CYP older than 10 years, Asian and 
Black ethnic backgrounds and comorbidities were over-represented in
SARS-CoV-2-related deaths compared with other CYP deaths. These results are
important for guiding decisions on shielding and vaccinating children. New
variants might have different mortality risks and should be evaluated in a
similar way.
