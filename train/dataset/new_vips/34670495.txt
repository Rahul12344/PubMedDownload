Plasma leakage is a precursor to life-threatening complications of dengue, but
this group is poorly defined and not often reported in literature. Patients with 
Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) as defined in the 1997 World Health Organization 
classification are often reported, and they all have plasma leakage, but some
patients with plasma leakage do not meet the definition of DHF. The study aims to
estimate the frequency of plasma leakage and DHF (as a surrogate of plasma
leakage) in dengue and its variations based on virus serotype, geography, patient
gender and pre-existing immunity to dengue. PUBMED, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL and
Web of Science were searched for prospective observational studies reporting on
plasma leakage or DHF. Quality of data was assessed using the NIH quality
assessment tool for cohort studies. Forty-three studies that recruited 15,794
confirmed dengue patients were eligible. Cumulative frequency of plasma leakage
was 36.8% (15 studies, 1642/4462, 95% CI 35.4-38.2%), but surprisingly the
estimated cumulative frequency of DHF was higher (45.7%, 32 studies, 4758/10417, 
95% CI 44.7-46.6%), indicating that current medical literature over-reports DHF
or under-reports plasma leakage. Therefore, a reliable estimate for the
proportion of dengue patients developing plasma leakage cannot be derived from
existing medical literature even after applying rigorous inclusion criteria to
select homogenous studies. Plasma leakage is an important marker of "at-risk"
dengue patients and standardizing its definition, diagnosis and reporting should 
be a priority in research and global policy.
