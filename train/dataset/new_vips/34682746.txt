Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 seems to be a rare phenomenon. The objective of this 
study is to carry out a systematic search of literature on the SARS-CoV-2
reinfection in order to understand the success of the global vaccine campaigns. A
systematic search was performed. Inclusion criteria included a positive RT-PCR
test of more than 90 days after the initial test and the confirmed recovery or a 
positive RT-PCR test of more than 45 days after the initial test that is
accompanied by compatible symptoms or epidemiological exposure, naturally after
the confirmed recovery. Only 117 articles were included in the final review with 
260 confirmed cases. The severity of the reinfection episode was more severe in
92/260 (35.3%) with death only in 14 cases. The observation that many reinfection
cases were less severe than initial cases is interesting because it may suggest
partial protection from disease. Another interesting line of data is the
detection of different clades or lineages by genome sequencing between initial
infection and reinfection in 52/260 cases (20%). The findings are useful and
contribute towards the role of vaccination in response to the COVID-19
infections. Due to the reinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2, it is evident that the 
level of immunity is not 100% for all individuals. These data highlight how it is
necessary to continue to observe all the prescriptions recently indicated in the 
literature in order to avoid new contagion for all people after healing from
COVID-19 or becoming asymptomatic positive.
