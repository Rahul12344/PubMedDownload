Since we are able to bring ionizing radiation in the form of a gas cloud to the
respiratory system, we have wondered whether Xenon-133 inhalation could be
exploited as a treatment option against Covid-19 respiratory virus infections,
and urge colleagues in the scientific research community who have the capability 
to do so to explore the merits of using Xenon-133 in this way to determine
whether its usefulness against the Covid-19 virus is indeed genuine.
