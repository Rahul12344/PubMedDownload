The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the COVID-19-related
confinement and social restrictions affected the levels of physical fitness and
academic achievement in primary school French children. A total of 206 primary
school children (106 before confinements and 100 after restrictions) completed a 
test battery evaluating their anthropometric characteristics, body compositions, 
activity preferences, cognitive performances and physical fitness. The
performance of the Standing Long Jump was better at T0 (169.9 ± 142.5 cm)
compared to T1 (135.2 ± 31.4 cm) (p = 0.0367), and the Medicine Ball Throw
performance declined from T0 to T1 (297.3 ± 81.1 cm vs. 249 ± 52 cm; p < 0.0001).
Motor skills (26.9 ± 6.2 s vs. 30.9 ± 5.4 s; p < 0.0001), the shuttle-run test
(stages completed), Maximal Aerobic Speed, and the estimated VO2max were lower at
T1 compared to T0 (p < 0.0001). Executive functioning was found to be greater at 
T0 compared to T1 (p < 0.0001). Explicit liking or wanting for sedentary or
physical activities did not change between T0 and T1. Both overall physical
fitness and cognitive performance drastically declined among primary school
French children with the COVID-19-related public health restrictions, which
reinforces the need to urgently develop preventive strategies in anticipation of 
further mitigation measures.
