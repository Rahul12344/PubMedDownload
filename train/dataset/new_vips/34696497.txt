Respiratory viruses are known to be the most frequent causative mediators of lung
infections in humans, bearing significant impact on the host cell signaling
machinery due to their host-dependency for efficient replication. Certain
cellular functions are actively induced by respiratory viruses for their own
benefit. This includes metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, fatty acid
synthesis (FAS) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, among others, which are
modified during viral infections. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of
metabolic pathway modifications mediated by the acute respiratory viruses
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), influenza virus (IV),
parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus (CoV) and adenovirus (AdV), and highlight 
potential targets and compounds for therapeutic approaches.
