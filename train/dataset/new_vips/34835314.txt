The increasing involvement of wild waterfowl in H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza Virus (HPAIV) circulation continues to pose a threat to animal and
public health worldwide. In winter 2020-2021, two field surveillance activities
were carried out on a weekly basis, through virological and serological analyses,
in 823 hunted and 521 trapped migratory aquatic birds in northeast Italy. Sixty
Eurasian teals were recaptured several times, which allowed us to follow the
progression of the HPAI H5 infection in naturally infected wild waterfowl.
Oropharyngeal, cloacal, and feather swabs (OS, CS and FS) were collected from
each duck and tested by real time rRT-PCR Type A influenza. The identified
viruses were characterized and pathotyped by sequencing. Several viruses
belonging to three different HPAI H5 subtypes were detected: H5N8, H5N5, and
H5N1. High prevalence of infection with HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4b during
November-December 2020 (up to 27.1%) was observed in captured Eurasian teals,
while infection rates in hunted dabbling ducks, mainly Eurasian wigeons, showed
the highest prevalence of infection in November 2020 (8.9%) and January 2021
(10.2%). All HPAI positive birds were also clinically healthy when recaptured
weeks apart. The OS and FS showed the highest detection efficiency of HPAIV. Our 
results highlight that HPAI passive surveillance should be complemented by a
targeted active surveillance to more efficiently detect novel HPAI viruses.
