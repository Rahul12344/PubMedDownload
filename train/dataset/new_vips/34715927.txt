BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study is twofold: (1) to examine the
effect of COVID-19 safety measures, enacted to prevent transmission of
SARS-nCOV-2, on total physical activity in the adult general population (≥
18 years) and (2) to analyze the impact of the factor "severity of safety
measures" on potential changes in physical activity. The secondary objective is
to investigate the effects of safety measures on the respective PA intensities,
i.e., sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity.
METHODS: A systematic literature search will be performed in the following online
databases: Medline (on Ovid), Web of Science, Scopus, L.OVE Coronavirus disease
by Epistemonikos, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. All obtained citations
will undergo title and abstract as well as full-text screening by two independent
reviewers. Observational studies investigating the effects of safety measures on 
physical activity patterns in the adult general population will be included. The 
standardized mean difference in total physical activity per time unit between
pre- and during COVID-19 or between normative data and during COVID-19 will be
the primary outcome. The standardized mean difference in sedentary time, light,
moderate, and vigorous physical activity will be assessed as secondary outcomes. 
Eligible studies will be divided between the reviewers for data extraction using 
a pilot-tested data form. Risk of bias assessment will be performed using a
standard assessment tool. If suitable, a random-effects meta-analysis and
meta-regression with a unit of safety measure severity as the independent
variable will be performed.
DISCUSSION: This study will synthesize available data reporting the effect of
COVID-19 safety measures on physical activity patterns in adults. Furthermore, we
will incorporate a unit for the severity of safety measures for better
generalizability of the results. These findings will be of great value for public
health policymaking and estimating future health consequences.
