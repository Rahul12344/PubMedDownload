The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the management of urothelial carcinoma (UC).
Eighteen months after the onset of the pandemic, a scoping narrative review was
able to state that radical cystectomy for UC should not be delayed beyond 10
weeks when neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was administered and 12 weeks when it
was not. NAC should be considered when imminent chemotherapy cannot be performed.
Early cystectomy should not be delayed when indicated for patients with high-risk
non-MIBC. Patients with non-MIBC should still receive their induction doses of
intravesical instillations. Diagnostic cystoscopy should not be deferred in
symptomatic patients. Surgical management of upper tract urothelial carcinoma
(UTUC) allows for a wider deferral interval.
