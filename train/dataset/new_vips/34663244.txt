BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, reductions in healthcare utilization
are reported in different contexts. Nevertheless, studies have not explored
specifically gender disparities in access to healthcare in the context of
COVID-19.
METHODS: To evaluate gender disparities in access to medical in Chile we
conducted an interrupted time series analysis using segmented regression. The
outcome variable was the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic
and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. The series
contained data from weeks 1 to 39 for 2017 to 2020. The intervention period
started at week 12. We selected this period because preventive interventions,
such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. We
estimated the level effect using a dummy variable indicating the intervention
period and slope effect using a continuous variable from weeks 12 to 39. To test 
heterogeneity by gender and age group, we conducted a stratified analysis.
RESULTS: We observed a sizable reduction in access to care with a slowly recovery
for oncologic (level effect 0.323; 95% CI 0.291-0.359; slope effect 1.022; 95% CI
1.016-1.028) and cardiovascular diseases (level effect 0.586; 95% CI 0.564-0.609;
slope effect 1.009; 95% CI 1.007-1.011). Greater reduction occurred in women
compared to men, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (level effect
0.595; 95% CI 0.566-0.627 versus 0.532; 95% CI 0.502-0.564) and colorectal cancer
(level effect 0.295; 95% CI 0.248-0.35 versus 0.19; 95% CI 0.159-0.228). Compared
to men, a greater absolute reduction was observed in women for oncologic
diseases, excluding sex-specific cancer, (1352; 95% CI 743-1961) and
cardiovascular diseases (1268; 95% CI 946-1590).
CONCLUSION: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnoses for time-sensitive
conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for 
women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate
a gender perspective into the pandemic response.
