Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are responsible for dengue virus
(DENV) transmission in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, where an
estimated 3 billion people live at risk of DENV exposure. DENV-infected
individuals show symptoms ranging from sub-clinical or mild to hemorrhagic fever.
Infected mosquitoes do not show detectable signs of disease, even though the
virus maintains a lifelong persistent infection. The interactions between viruses
and host mitochondria are crucial for virus replication and pathogenicity. DENV
infection in vertebrate cells modulates mitochondrial function and dynamics to
facilitate viral proliferation. Here, we describe that DENV also regulates
mitochondrial function and morphology in infected C6/36 mosquito cells (derived
from Aedes albopictus). Our results showed that DENV infection increased ROS
(reactive oxygen species) production, modulated mitochondrial transmembrane
potential and induced changes in mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we offer
the first evidence that DENV causes translocation of mitofusins to mitochondria
in the C6/36 mosquito cell line. Another protein Drp-1 (Dynamin-related protein
1) did not localize to mitochondria in DENV-infected cells. This observation
therefore ruled out the possibility that the abovementioned alterations in
mitochondrial function are associated with mitochondrial fission. In summary,
this report provides some key insights into the virus-mitochondria crosstalk in
DENV infected mosquito cells.
