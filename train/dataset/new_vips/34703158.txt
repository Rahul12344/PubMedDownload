Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening emergency, characterized by rapid
accumulation of pericardial fluid. There are multiple risk factors for cardiac
tamponade, nephrotic syndrome is an uncommon one, especially in adults. Herein,
we are reporting a 35-year-old African American woman with membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis secondary to human immunodeficiency virus-associated immune
complex kidney disease (HIVICK), who presented with cardiac tamponade. The
patient had pericardiocentesis and was discharged, with outpatient follow-up with
cardiology, nephrology, and infectious disease. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report of HIVICK nephrotic syndrome associated with cardiac
tamponade.
