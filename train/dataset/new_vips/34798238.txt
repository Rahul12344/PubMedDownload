Human interferon alpha (hIFN-α) administration constitutes the current FDA
approved therapy for chronic Hepatitis B and C virus infections. Additionally,
hIFN-α treatment efficacy was recently demonstrated in patients with COVID-19.
Thus, hIFN-α constitutes a therapeutic alternative for those countries where
vaccination is inaccessible and for people who did not respond effectively to
vaccination. However, hIFN-α2b exhibits a short plasma half-life resulting in the
occurrence of severe side effects. To optimize the cytokine's pharmacokinetic
profile, we developed a hyperglycosylated IFN, referred to as GMOP-IFN. Given the
significant number of reports showing neutralizing antibodies (NAb) formation
after hIFN-α administration, here we applied the DeFT (De-immunization of
Functional Therapeutics) approach to develop functional, de-immunized versions of
GMOP-IFN. Two GMOP-IFN variants exhibited significantly reduced ex vivo
immunogenicity and null antiproliferative activity, while preserving antiviral
function. The results obtained in this work indicate that the new de-immunized
GMOP-IFN variants constitute promising candidates for antiviral therapy.
