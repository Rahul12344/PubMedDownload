Following infection or immunization, memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma 
cells provide humoral immunity that can last for decades. Most principles of MBC 
biology have been determined with hapten-protein carrier models or fluorescent
protein immunizations. Here, we examine the temporal dynamics of the germinal
center (GC) B cell and MBC response following mouse influenza A virus infection. 
We find that antiviral B cell responses within the lung-draining mediastinal
lymph node (mLN) and the spleen are distinct in regard to duration, enrichment
for antigen-binding cells, and class switching dynamics. While splenic GCs
dissolve after 6 weeks post-infection, mLN hemagglutinin-specific (HA+) GCs can
persist for 22 weeks. Persistent GCs continuously differentiate MBCs, with "peak"
and "late" GCs contributing equal numbers of HA+ MBCs to the long-lived
compartment. Our findings highlight critical aspects of persistent GC responses
and MBC differentiation following respiratory virus infection with direct
implications for developing effective vaccination strategies.
