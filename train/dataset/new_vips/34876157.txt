BACKGROUND: Omics data, driven by rapid advances in laboratory techniques, have
been generated very quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to use omics
data to highlight the involvement of specific pathways, as well as that of cell
types and organs, in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and to highlight their
links with clinical phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: The analysis was based on the domain model, where for domain it is
intended a conceptual repository, useful to summarize multiple biological
pathways involved at different levels. The relevant domains considered in the
analysis were: virus, pathways and phenotypes. An interdisciplinary expert
working group was defined for each domain, to carry out an independent literature
scoping review.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that dysregulated pathways of innate immune
responses, (i.e., complement activation, inflammatory responses, neutrophil
activation and degranulation, platelet degranulation) can affect COVID-19
progression and outcomes. These results are consistent with several clinical
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-omics approach may help to further investigate unknown aspects
of the disease. However, the disease mechanisms are too complex to be explained
by a single molecular signature and it is necessary to consider an integrated
approach to identify hallmarks of severity.
