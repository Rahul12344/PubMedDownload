Over the past three decades, highly increased whitefly (Bemisia tabaci)
populations have been observed on the staple food crop cassava in eastern Africa 
and associated with ensuing viral disease pandemics and food insecurity.
Increased whitefly numbers have also been observed in other key agricultural
crops and weeds. Factors behind the population surges on different crops and
their interrelationships are unclear, although in cassava they have been
associated with specific populations within the Bemisia tabaci species complex
known to infest cassava crops in Africa. This study carried out an in-depth
survey to understand the distribution of B. tabaci populations infesting crops
and uncultivated plant hosts in Uganda, a centre of origin for this pest complex.
Whitefly samples were collected from 59 identified plant species and 25
unidentified weeds in a countrywide survey. Identities of 870 individual adult
whiteflies were determined through mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 sequences
(651 bp) in the 3' barcode region used for B. tabaci systematics. Sixteen B.
tabaci and five related whitefly putative species were identified based on > 4.0%
nucleotide divergence, of which three are proposed as novel B. tabaci putative
species and four as novel closely related whitefly species. The most prevalent
whiteflies were classified as B. tabaci MED-ASL (30.5% of samples), sub-Saharan
Africa 1 (SSA1, 22.7%) and Bemisia Uganda1 (12.1%). These species were also
indicated to be the most polyphagous occurring on 33, 40 and 25 identified plant 
species, respectively. Multiple (≥ 3) whitefly species occurred on specific crops
(bean, eggplant, pumpkin and tomato) and weeds (Sida acuta and Ocimum
gratissimum). These plants may have increased potential to act as reservoirs for 
mixed infections of whitefly-vectored viruses. Management of whitefly pest
populations in eastern Africa will require an integration of approaches that
consider their degree of polyphagy and a climate that enables the continuous
presence of crop and uncultivated plant hosts.Supplementary Information: The
