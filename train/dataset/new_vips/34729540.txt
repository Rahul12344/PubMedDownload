Difficulty in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission made the ability to inactivate 
viruses in aerosols and fomites to be an important and attractive risk reduction 
measure. Evidence that light frequencies have the ability to inhibit
microorganisms has already been reported by many studies which, however, focused 
on ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, which are known to induce potential injury in
humans. In the present study, the effect on suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 of a Light 
Emitting Diode (LED) device capable of radiating frequencies in the non-hazardous
visible light spectrum (VIS) was investigated. In order to evaluate the
efficiency of viral inactivation, plaque assay and western blot of viral proteins
were performed. The observed results showed a significant reduction in infectious
particles that had been exposed to the LED irradiation of visible light.
Furthermore, the analysis of the intracellular expression of viral proteins
confirmed the inactivating effect of this irradiation technology. This in vitro
study revealed for the first time the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 through LED
irradiation with multiple wavelengths of the visible spectrum. However additional
and more in-depth studies can aim to demonstrate the data obtained during these
experiments in different matrices, in mutable environmental conditions and on
other respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus. The type of LED technology
can decisively contribute on reducing virus transmission through the continuous
sanitation of common environments without risks for humans and animals.
