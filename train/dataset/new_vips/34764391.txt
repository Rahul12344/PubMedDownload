The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 influences viral function as residue replacements
affect both physiochemical properties and folding conformations. Although a large
amount of data on SARS-CoV-2 is available, the investigation of how viral
functions change in response to mutations is hampered by a lack of effective
structural analysis. Here, we exploit the advances of protein structure
fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by
mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations, 
the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, including Alpha variant
(lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). The results showed that 
the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical
properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2, which plays a
critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, these
structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the
course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The analysis of structural variations revealed
how the coronavirus has gradually evolved in both structure and function and how 
the SARS-CoV-2 variants have contributed to more severe acute disease worldwide.
