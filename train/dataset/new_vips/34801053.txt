INTRODUCTION: Given that many pregnant women have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection and that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked to poor maternal
and neonatal outcomes, we looked into the relationship between the hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg) and GDM to see if a high HBV DNA load is linked to a
higher risk of GDM in chronic maternal HBsAg carriers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 39,539 pregnant women who gave birth at
the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in Guangzhou,
China, between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019. The patients were divided 
into two groups: HBsAg negative (36,500) and positive (3039). The viral load
levels of 1250 HBsAg-positive women who had tested their HBV DNA load during
pregnancy were separated into three groups. We utilized univariate and
multivariable logistical regression analysis to determine the relationship
between maternal chronic HBsAg carrier and GDM.
RESULTS: Being HBsAg positive was discovered to be an independent risk factor for
GDM.Pre-pregnancy Obesity and advanced age were linked to an increased incidence 
of GDM. Those with a high HBV DNA load (> 106 IU/mL) had a higher risk of GDM
than HBsAg-positive women with a low viral load (< 103 IU/mL). Pre-eclampsia and 
intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) appeared to be more common in
HBsAg-positive women than in uninfected women.
CONCLUSIONS: Being HBsAg positive, advanced age, and pre-pregnancy obesity were
all revealed to be independent risk factors for GDM in our study. In HBsAg
carrier, pregnant women, a high HBV DNA burden was linked to a greater risk of
GDM. Furthermore, being an HBsAg carrier during pregnancy raised the risk of ICP 
and pre-eclampsia.
