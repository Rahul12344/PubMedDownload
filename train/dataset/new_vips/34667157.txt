Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) embodies a mixture of clinical manifestations,
including elevated circulating cytokine levels, acute systemic inflammatory
symptoms and secondary organ dysfunction, which was first described in the
context of acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic
stem-cell transplantation and was later observed in pandemics of influenza,
SARS-CoV and COVID-19, immunotherapy of tumor, after chimeric antigen receptor T 
(CAR-T) therapy, and in monogenic disorders and autoimmune diseases.
Particularly, severe CRS is a very significant and life-threatening complication,
which is clinically characterized by persistent high fever, hyperinflammation,
and severe organ dysfunction. However, CRS is a double-edged sword, which may be 
both helpful in controlling tumors/viruses/infections and harmful to the host.
Although a high incidence and high levels of cytokines are features of CRS, the
detailed kinetics and specific mechanisms of CRS in human diseases and
intervention therapy remain unclear. In the present review, we have summarized
the most recent advances related to the clinical features and management of CRS
as well as cutting-edge technologies to elucidate the mechanisms of CRS.
Considering that CRS is the major adverse event in human diseases and
intervention therapy, our review delineates the characteristics, kinetics,
signaling pathways, and potential mechanisms of CRS, which shows its clinical
relevance for achieving both favorable efficacy and low toxicity.
