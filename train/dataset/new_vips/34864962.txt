Following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, people living with HIV (PLWH) had lower
surrogate virus neutralization test response (p=0.03) and a trend towards lower
IgG response (p=0.08), particularly among those with lower CD4+T-cell counts and 
who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Study of the impact of supplemental vaccine
doses among PLWH is needed.
