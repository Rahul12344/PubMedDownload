Marburg virus disease (MVD) caused by the Marburg virus (MARV) generally appears 
with flu-like symptoms and leads to severe hemorrhagic fever. It spreads via
direct contact with infected individuals or animals. Despite being considered to 
be less threatening in terms of appearances and the number of infected patients, 
the high fatality rate of this pathogenic virus is a major concern. Until now, no
vaccine has been developed to combat this deadly virus. Therefore, vaccination
for this virus is necessary to reduce its mortality. Our current investigation
focuses on the design and formulation of a multi-epitope vaccine based on the
structural proteins of MARV employing immunoinformatics approaches. The screening
of potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes from the seven structural proteins of
MARV was carried out through specific selection parameters. Afterward, we
compiled the shortlisted epitopes by attaching them to an appropriate adjuvant
and linkers. Population coverage analysis, conservancy analysis, and MHC cluster 
analysis of the shortlisted epitopes were satisfactory. Importantly,
physicochemical characteristics, human homology assessment, and structure
validation of the vaccine construct delineated convenient outcomes. We
implemented disulfide bond engineering to stabilize the tertiary or quaternary
interactions. Furthermore, stability and physical movements of the vaccine
protein were explored using normal-mode analysis. The immune simulation study of 
the vaccine complexes also exhibited significant results. Additionally, the
protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation of the final construct 
exhibited a higher affinity toward toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). From simulation
trajectories, multiple descriptors, namely, root mean square deviations (rmsd),
radius of gyration (Rg), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), solvent-accessible
surface area (SASA), and hydrogen bonds, have been taken into account to
demonstrate the inflexible and rigid nature of receptor molecules and the
constructed vaccine. Inclusively, our findings suggested the vaccine constructs' 
ability to regulate promising immune responses against MARV pathogenesis.
