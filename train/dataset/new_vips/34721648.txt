Objective: To investigate the efficacy differences between acyclovir and
ganciclovir in the treatment of children with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-
associated infectious mononucleosis (IM).
Methods: A total of 128 children with EBV-IM who were admitted to our hospital
from February 2019 to February 2021 were selected and randomly divided into the
acyclovir group (n = 64) and the ganciclovir group (n = 64) according to the
random number table method. All the children were given symptomatic treatments
such as protecting the liver and reducing fever. On this basis, the acyclovir
group was given an intravenous drip of acyclovir, while the ganciclovir group was
given an intravenous drip of ganciclovir. The treatment was continued for 7 days.
After the treatment, the clinical efficacy, disappearance time of symptoms and
signs, related blood routine indexes, EBV-DNA negative conversion rate, and the
incidence of adverse reactions during the treatment were compared between the two
groups.
Results: After treatment, the total effective rate of the ganciclovir group
(92.19%) was higher than that of the acyclovir group (73.44%) and the difference 
was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The disappearance time for the symptoms
and signs of angina, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly in
the ganciclovir group was lower than that in the acyclovir group, and the
difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels 
of atypical lymphocyte proportion, lymphocyte proportion, and WBC count in the
two groups were lower than those before treatment, the levels in the ganciclovir 
group were lower than those in the acyclovir group, and the difference was
statistically significant (P < 0.05). After treatment, the EBV-DNA negative
conversion rate (81.25%) in the ganciclovir group was higher than that in the
acyclovir group (60.93%) and the difference was statistically significant (P <
0.05). During treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions in the ganciclovir
group was significantly lower than that in the acyclovir group and the difference
was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: In the treatment of children with EBV-IM, the therapeutic effect of
ganciclovir is obviously superior to that of acyclovir. Ganciclovir can quickly
eliminate the symptoms of angina, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and other signs in
children, can improve abnormal blood indicators, and has a higher negative
conversion rate of EBV and less adverse reactions.
