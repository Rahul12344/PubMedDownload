INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation (LTX). Calcineurin inhibitor
(CNI) nephrotoxicity is the leading cause of CKD. After kidney transplantation,
polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN) is a well-recognized problem. This
study aims to evaluate the role of polyomavirus in patients after LTX.
METHODS: From January 2017 to January 2020, all lung transplant recipients who
performed follow-up visits in our center were included in the study and
retrospectively assessed. We measured renal function (creatinine levels before
and after transplantation), JCPyV, and BKPyV load by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) in serum and urine samples after transplantation.
RESULTS: In total, 104 consecutive patients (59 males, 56.7%) with a mean age of 
49.6 ± 11.1 years were identified. JCPyV was found in urine of 36 patients
(34.6%) and serum of 3 patients (2.9%). BKPyV was found in urine of 40 patients
(38.5%) and serum of 4 patients (3.8%), respectively. Urine evidence for JCPyV
(p < 0.001, coefficient: +21.44) and BKPyV (p < 0.001, coefficient: +29.65)
correlated highly with further kidney function decline.
CONCLUSION: Kidney function deterioration is associated with JCPyV and BKPyV
viruria in patients after LTX. This might indicate a role of PyVAN in lung
transplant recipients.
