BACKGROUND AND AIMS: India has a significant burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection and has committed to achieving national elimination by 2030. This will 
require a substantial scale-up in testing and treatment. The "HEAD-Start Project 
Delhi" aimed to enhance HCV diagnosis and treatment pathways among the general
population.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at 5 district hospitals (Arm 1:
one-stop shop), 15 polyclinics (Arm 2: referral for viral load (VL) testing and
treatment) and 62 screening camps (Arm 3: referral for treatment). HCV
prevalence, retention in the HCV care cascade, and turn-around time were
measured.
RESULTS: Between January and September 2019, 37 425 participants were screened
for HCV. The median (IQR) age of participants was 35 (26-48) years, with 50.4%
male and 49.6% female. A significantly higher proportion of participants in Arm 1
(93.7%) and Arm 3 (90.3%) received a VL test compared with Arm 2 (52.5%,
P < .001). Of those confirmed positive, treatment was initiated at significantly 
higher rates for participants in both Arms 1 (85.6%) and 2 (73.7%) compared to
Arm 3 (41.8%, P < .001). Arm 1 was found to be a cost-saving strategy compared to
Arm 2, Arm 3, and no action.
CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of all services at a single site (district hospitals)
resulted in a higher yield of HCV seropositive cases and retention compared with 
sites where participants were referred elsewhere for VL testing and/or treatment.
The highest level of retention in the care cascade was also associated with the
shortest turn-around times.
