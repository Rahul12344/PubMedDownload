OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a Community Health Worker (CHW)-led
influenza campaign on knowledge and attitudes about vaccination in Latinx migrant
and refugee populations.
METHODS: Twelve online workshops were conducted with 183 participants and 24 CHWs
between January 12 and May 12, 2021. Participants were Latinx families living in 
underserved communities throughout Washington state. The initiative also included
radio, animated videos, advertisements, social media, and educational materials.
RESULTS: Analysis of pre and post workshop surveys from 155 participants showed
statistically significant improvements in all questions about the definition of
influenza, symptoms, and risks: and in 7 of 9 questions about treatments and
vaccines. Analysis of 2 open-ended questions showed increases in words key to
understanding influenza, such as "virus," "illness," "death," and "contagious."
There were significant increases in rates of participants identifying vaccination
and antibiotics as cures for influenza.
CONCLUSIONS: CHW-led workshops can be an effective way to increase knowledge
about influenza and influenza vaccine. Future curriculum should emphasize the
difference between viruses and bacteria, and the use of vaccination for
prevention as opposed to treatment for illness.
