The accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in Parkinson's disease,
dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy is thought to involve a
common prion-like mechanism, whereby misfolded α-syn provides a conformational
template for further accumulation of pathological α-syn. We tested whether
silencing α-syn gene expression could reduce native non-aggregated α-syn
substrate and thereby disrupt the propagation of pathological α-syn initiated by 
seeding with synucleinopathy-affected mouse brain homogenates. Unilateral
intracerebral injections of adeno-associated virus serotype-1 encoding microRNA
targeting the α-syn gene reduced the extent and severity of both the α-syn
pathology and motor deficits. Importantly, a moderate 50% reduction in α-syn was 
sufficient to prevent the spread of α-syn pathology to distal brain regions. Our 
study combines behavioural, immunohistochemical and biochemical data that
strongly support α-syn knockdown gene therapy for synucleinopathies.
