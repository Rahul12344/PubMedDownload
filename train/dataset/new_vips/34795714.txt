Background: Malaria parasite has been observed to be a common infection in Human 
Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), an increase malaria infection in adults.
Objective: This experimental study is sets to determine the prevalence and
density of malaria parasitaemia in Warri community, South-Southern Nigeria.
Methods and Results: A total of 600 participants were screened for Human
immunodeficiency virus and malaria parasite using WHO systems two and Geimsa
staining technique for thick and thin blood films and absolute parasite counts
done respectively. The prevalence rate of 38% and 39% were obtained for malaria
parasite infection among HIVSP and HIV/span>SN respectively. The difference in
malaria parasite infection was not statistically significant (P>0.05) between
HIVSP and HIVSN. However, the mean parasite density in HIVSP was significant
(P<0.05) when compared with HIVSN. The mean parasite densities of 2384 ± 747 and 
1883 ± 645 were recorded for HIVSP and HIVSN respectively. The mean parasite
densities of 2385 ± 782 and 2383 ± 717 observed for males and females
respectively showed no statistical significant difference (P<0.05).
Conclusion: This study has shown a high prevalence of malaria parasite among the 
HIV infected subjects.
