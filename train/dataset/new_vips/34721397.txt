Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CTLs) limit HIV pathogenesis, as evidenced in elite 
controllers (a subset of individuals who suppress the virus without the need for 
therapy). CD4+ CTLs have also been shown to kill HIV-infected macrophages.
However, little is known about their contribution towards HIV persistence, how
they are affected following exposure to immune modulators like morphine, and what
factors maintain their frequencies and function. Further, the lack of robust
markers to identify CD4+ CTLs in various animal models limits understanding of
their role in HIV pathogenesis. We utilized various PBMC samples obtained from
SIV infected and cART treated rhesus macaques exposed to morphine or saline and
subjected to flow cytometry evaluations. Thereafter, we compared and correlated
the expression of CD4+ CTL-specific markers to viral load and viral reservoir
estimations in total CD4+ T cells. We found that CD29 could be reliably used as a
marker to identify CD4+ CTLs in rhesus macaques since CD29hi CD4+ T cells secrete
higher cytotoxic and proinflammatory cytokines following PMA/ionomycin or gag
stimulation. In addition, this immune cell subset was depleted during untreated
SIV infection. Strikingly, we also observed that early initiation of cART
reconstitutes depleted CD29hi CD4+ T cells and restores their function.
Furthermore, we noted that morphine exposure reduced the secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines/cytotoxic molecules in CD29hi CD4+ T cells. Lastly,
increased functionality of CD29hi CD4+ T cells as depicted by elevated levels of 
either IL-21 or granzyme B hi T Bet+ gag specific responses were linked to
limiting the size of the replication-competent reservoir during cART treatment.
Collectively, our data suggest that CD4+ CTLs are crucial in limiting SIV
pathogenesis and persistence.
