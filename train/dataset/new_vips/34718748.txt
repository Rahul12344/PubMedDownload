Virus infections are huge threats to living organisms and cause many diseases,
such as COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has led to millions of deaths. To
develop effective strategies to control viral infection, we need to understand
its molecular events in host cells. Virus related functional genomic datasets are
growing rapidly, however, an integrative platform for systematically
investigating host responses to viruses is missing. Here, we developed a
user-friendly multi-omics portal of viral infection named as MVIP
(https://mvip.whu.edu.cn/). We manually collected available high-throughput
sequencing data under viral infection, and unified their detailed metadata
including virus, host species, infection time, assay, and target, etc. We
processed multi-layered omics data of more than 4900 viral infected samples from 
77 viruses and 33 host species with standard pipelines, including RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq, and CLIP-seq, etc. In addition, we integrated these genome-wide signals
into customized genome browsers, and developed multiple dynamic charts to
exhibit the information, such as time-course dynamic and differential gene
expression profiles, alternative splicing changes and enriched GO/KEGG terms.
Furthermore, we implemented several tools for efficiently mining the virus-host
interactions by virus, host and genes. MVIP would help users to retrieve
large-scale functional information and promote the understanding of virus-host
interactions.
