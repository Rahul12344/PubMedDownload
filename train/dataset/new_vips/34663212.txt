BACKGROUND: Antigen testing offers rapid and inexpensive testing for SARS-CoV-2
but concerns regarding performance, especially sensitivity, remain. Limited data 
exists for use of antigen testing in asymptomatic patients; thus, performance and
reliability of antigen testing remains unclear.
METHODS: 148 symptomatic and 144 asymptomatic adults were included. A nasal swab 
was collected for testing by Quidel Sofia SARS IFA (Sofia) as point of care. A
nasopharyngeal swab was also collected and transported to the laboratory for
testing by Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV RT-PCR (Cepheid).
RESULTS: Overall, Sofia had good agreement with Cepheid (> 95%) in adults,
however was less sensitive. Sofia had a sensitivity of 87.8% and 33.3% for
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Among symptomatic patients, 
testing > 5 days post symptom onset resulted in lower sensitivity (82%) when
compared with testing within 5 days of symptom onset (90%). Of the four Sofia
false-negative results in the asymptomatic cohort, 50% went on to develop
COVID-19 disease within 5 days of testing. Specificity in both symptomatic and
asymptomatic cohorts was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Sofia has acceptable performance in symptomatic adults when
tested < 5 days of symptom onset. Caution should be taken when testing patients
with ≥ 5 days of symptoms. The combination of low prevalence and reduced
sensitivity results in relatively poor performance of in asymptomatic patients.
NAAT-based diagnostic assays should be considered in when antigen testing is
unreliable, particularly in symptomatic patients with > 5 days of symptom onset
and asymptomatic patients.
