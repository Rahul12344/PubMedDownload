BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in utero is very common during
pregnancy, which can lead to adverse outcomes in both pregnancy and progeny, but 
its pathogenesis has not been fully clarified. The decrease of extravillous
cytotrophoblasts (EVT) invasion is an essential pathophysiological process of
some pregnancy complications. Hippo-YAP signaling pathway plays an important role
in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, whether YAP is involved 
in HCMV uterine infection remains to be studied.
METHODS: The primary EVT was cultured and infected by the HCMV strain AD169 virus
in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining of HCMVpp65 antigen was conducted afterward
to confirm the establishment of an infection model. The optimal virus infection
dose was determined by the EVT proliferation status in vitro. Real-time PCR was
performed to examine the mRNA level of major genes involved in the Hippo pathway 
in EVT after HCMV infection. The effect of HCMV on the expression of YAP protein 
in EVT was evaluated by Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. An in vitro
cell invasion assay was carried out to analyze the influence of HCMV on EVT
invasion. The changes of EVT invasion was accessed by establishing YAP silencing 
and over-expression models using YAP1 specific siRNA and plasmid pcDH.
RESULTS: The optimal HCMV infection dose was 282.5TCID50/ml. Compared to the
control group, the infection of HCMV significantly reduced the mRNA expression of
Mst1, Mst2, SAV, Lats1, Lats2, Mob1, YAP1, TAZ, TEAD1-4 genes and YAP protein
expression in the Hippo-YAP pathway. HCMV infection also decreased the EVT
invasion. In non-infected EVT, the number of transmembrane EVT cells was
significantly reduced when YAP1 gene was silenced, while it was significantly
increased when YAP1 gene was over-expressed. In the HCMV-infected EVT, the number
of transmembrane EVT cells significantly increased when over-expressed and
eventually recovered to the level of NC.
CONCLUSIONS: HCMV may decrease EVT invasion by inhibiting the expression of mRNA 
and protein of YAP in the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. HCMV eventually reduces
the invasion ability of EVT by inhibiting multiple genes in the Hippo-YAP
signaling pathway, especially inhibiting YAP which serves as the downstream
effector.
