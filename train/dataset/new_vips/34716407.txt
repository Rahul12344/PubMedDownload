Circular tandem repeat proteins ('cTRPs') are de novo designed protein scaffolds 
(in this and prior studies, based on antiparallel two-helix bundles) that contain
repeated protein sequences and structural motifs and form closed circular
structures. They can display significant stability and solubility, a wide range
of sizes, and are useful as protein display particles for biotechnology
applications. However, cTRPs also demonstrate inefficient self-assembly from
smaller subunits. In this study, we describe a new generation of cTRPs, with
longer repeats and increased interaction surfaces, which enhanced the
self-assembly of two significantly different sizes of homotrimeric constructs.
Finally, we demonstrated functionalization of these constructs with (1) a
hexameric array of peptide-binding SH2 domains, and (2) a trimeric array of
anti-SARS CoV-2 VHH domains. The latter proved capable of sub-nanomolar binding
affinities towards the viral receptor binding domain and potent viral
neutralization function.
