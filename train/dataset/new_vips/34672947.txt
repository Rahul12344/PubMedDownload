The main viral protease (3CLpro) is indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We 
delineate the human protein substrate landscape of 3CLpro by TAILS
substrate-targeted N-terminomics. We identify more than 100 substrates in human
lung and kidney cells supported by analyses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Enzyme 
kinetics and molecular docking simulations of 3CLpro engaging substrates reveal
how noncanonical cleavage sites, which diverge from SARS-CoV, guide substrate
specificity. Cleaving the interactors of essential effector proteins, effectively
stranding them from their binding partners, amplifies the consequences of
proteolysis. We show that 3CLpro targets the Hippo pathway, including
inactivation of MAP4K5, and key effectors of transcription, mRNA processing, and 
translation. We demonstrate that Spike glycoprotein directly binds galectin-8,
with galectin-8 cleavage disengaging CALCOCO2/NDP52 to decouple
antiviral-autophagy. Indeed, in post-mortem COVID-19 lung samples, NDP52 rarely
colocalizes with galectin-8, unlike in healthy lungs. The 3CLpro substrate
degradome establishes a foundational substrate atlas to accelerate exploration of
SARS-CoV-2 pathology and drug design.
