A 7-amino acid peptide (7P), (Gly-Gln-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Ser-Gly) is one of the
synthesized mimic polypeptides, which is the second envelope protein at
hypervariable region 1 of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV HVR1). It contributed to
the anti-inflammatory reaction and inhibited lung Th9 responses in asthma through
binding to CD81. In this study, we examined the effects of 7P on
bronchoconstriction, acute inflammation of the airways, and lung Th2-type
responses during allergic lung inflammation. Our results determined that 7P
decreased bronchoconstriction and inhibited both acute inflammatory cytokines
(TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6) and Th2 cell cytokine responses (IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13)
during allergic lung inflammation. 7P directly inhibited lung Th2 cell
differentiation (7P: 5.1% vs. vehicle:12.2% and control 7P:12.2%) and suppressed 
airway inflammatory cytokine signal transduction to decrease Th2 cell response.
Overall, 7P significantly decreased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway
inflammation, and Th2 responses, which may serve as a novel therapeutic candidate
during allergic lung inflammation.
