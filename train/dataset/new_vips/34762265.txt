Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the one of most common causes of the hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), especially in eastern world. The aim of this review is to try to
understand the relationship between HBV and HCC and to reveal the role of
prevention and treatment of HBV infection in reducing the incidence of HCC.
Strategies to prevent HCC due to HBV can be classified into three categories.
These are primary, secondary, and tertiary preventions. Hepatitis B vaccine is
now in the most vital position in preventing HBV-associated HCC. In patients with
chronic hepatitis B infection, suppressing viral load with potent antivirals such
as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) prevents the
development of HCC and improves prognosis by reducing recurrence after HCC
treatments. There is currently no clear consensus on which of these drugs should 
be preferred. Although data on tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are scarce, available 
data with TDF suggest that TAF therapy will also be a strong actor for HCC.
