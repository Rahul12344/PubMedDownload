BACKGROUND: The WHO recommends mandatory serological testing of blood donors for 
hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
and syphilis. We evaluated the performance of Elecsys® infectious disease
immunoassays against commercially available comparator assays.
METHODS: Prospective, routine, anonymized patient or donor samples (n = 8,821)
were analyzed at three German sites using Elecsys antihepatitis B core antigen
(Anti-HBc II), Anti-HCV II, HIV combi PT, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg II),
and Syphilis immunoassays (cobas e 411 analyzer) versus ARCHITECT comparator
assays.
RESULTS: The Elecsys immunoassays demonstrated comparable sensitivity (≤ 1.54%
difference) and equivalent specificity (≤ 0.63% difference) to the respective
ARCHITECT comparator assays. Overall sensitivity for the Elecsys and ARCHITECT
infectious disease panels was 99.78% vs. 99.40%, respectively, and overall
specificity was 99.74% vs. 99.80%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Elecsys infectious disease immunoassays demonstrated high
sensitivity and specificity, which were similar to comparator assays, supporting 
their suitability for routine laboratory practice.
