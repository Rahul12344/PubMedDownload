BACKGROUND: On 9th January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus (later
named SARS-CoV-2) as the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Identifying the first appearance of virus is of epidemiological
importance to tracking and mapping the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a country. We
therefore conducted a retrospective observational study to detect SARS-CoV-2 in
oropharyngeal samples collected from hospitalized patients with a Severe Acute
Respiratory Infection (SARI) enrolled in the DRIVE (Development of Robust and
Innovative Vaccine Effectiveness) study in five Italian hospitals (CIRI-IT BIVE
hospitals network) (1st November 2019 - 29th February 2020).
OBJECTIVES: To acquire new information on the real trend in SARS-CoV-2 infection 
during pandemic phase I and to determine the possible early appearance of the
virus in Italy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were tested for influenza [RT-PCR assay (A/H1N1,
A/H3N2, B/Yam, B/Vic)] in accordance with the DRIVE study protocol. Subsequently,
swabs underwent molecular testing for SARS-COV-2. [one-step real-time multiplex
retro-transcription (RT) PCR].
RESULTS: In the 1683 samples collected, no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found.
Moreover, 28.3% (477/1683) of swabs were positive for influenza viruses, the
majority being type A (358 vs 119 type B). A/H3N2 was predominant among influenza
A viruses (55%); among influenza B viruses, B/Victoria was prevalent. The highest
influenza incidence rate was reported in patients aged 0-17 years (40.3%)
followed by those aged 18-64 years (24.4%) and ≥65 years (14.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, some studies have shown the early circulation of
SARS-CoV-2 in northern regions, those most severely affected during phase I of
the pandemic. In central and southern regions, by contrast no early circulation
of the virus was registered. These results are in line with ours. These findings 
highlight the need to continue to carry out retrospective studies, in order to
understand the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus, to better identify the
clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with other acute respiratory
illnesses (ARI), and to evaluate the real burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare
system.
