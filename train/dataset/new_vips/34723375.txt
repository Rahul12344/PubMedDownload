BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a 
major challenge for hospitals, which plays a key role in local and national
responses to different emergencies and disasters, including the outbreak of
communicable diseases.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the readiness of selected hospitals in 
one of the provinces of Iran in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.
METHODS: In this descriptive, analytical, and cross-sectional study, we used a
checklist developed by the World Health Organization for the COVID-19 pandemic to
assess the readiness of hospitals. We assessed and compared the readiness of four
hospitals and used Microsoft Excel 2013Â® to collect and analyze the data.
RESULTS: The present results showed that the hospital, which was the main
referral center for COVID-19, was in good conditions. However, other hospitals
needed to increase their preparedness for the COVID-19 epidemic.
CONCLUSION: Besides the importance of hospital readiness to respond to natural
and man-made disasters, these institutions and health policymakers should be also
prepared to respond properly to the outbreak of highly contagious diseases.
