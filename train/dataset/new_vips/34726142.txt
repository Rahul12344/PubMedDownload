OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of systemic overlap and typical coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms in healthcare personnel (HCP) following COVID-19
vaccination and association of reported symptoms with diagnosis of severe acute
respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the context of public
health recommendations regarding work exclusion.
DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted between December 16, 2020,
and March 14, 2021, with HCP who had received at least 1 dose of either the
Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
SETTING: Large healthcare system in New England.
INTERVENTIONS: HCP were prompted to complete a symptom survey for 3 days after
each vaccination. Reported symptoms generated automated guidance regarding
symptom management, SARS-CoV-2 testing requirements, and work restrictions.
Overlap symptoms (ie, fever, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, or headache) were
categorized as either lower or higher severity. Typical COVID-19 symptoms
included sore throat, cough, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, shortness of breath,
ageusia and anosmia.
RESULTS: Among 64,187 HCP, a postvaccination electronic survey had response rates
of 83% after dose 1 and 77% after dose 2. Report of ≥3 lower-severity overlap
symptoms, ≥1 higher-severity overlap symptoms, or at least 1 typical COVID-19
symptom after dose 1 was associated with increased likelihood of testing
positive. HCP with prior COVID-19 infection were significantly more likely to
report severe overlap symptoms after dose 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Reported overlap symptoms were common; however, only report of ≥3
low-severity overlap symptoms, at least 1 higher-severity overlap symptom, or any
typical COVID-19 symptom were associated with infection. Work-related
restrictions for overlap symptoms should be reconsidered.
