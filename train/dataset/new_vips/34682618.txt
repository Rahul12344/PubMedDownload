BACKGROUND: Control measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic had a
considerable impact on human daily life and lifestyles. Adherence to the
recommended measures is influenced by knowledge and attitudes towards the
disease. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the level of knowledge
regarding COVID-19, the related control measures, and lifestyle behaviors adopted
during the pandemic in a sample of elderly Italian people.
METHODS: A web-based questionnaire investigating socio-demographic
characteristics, knowledge of COVID-19, the related preventive measures, and
lifestyle changes that occurred during the pandemic, were distributed to ≥65
years old people living in South Italy.
RESULTS: A satisfactory level of knowledge about COVID-19 and the related control
measures has been found in the enrolled sample. However, a decrease in physical
activity, as well as worsening sleeping and dietary habits, were found in roughly
60% of participants. Females were impacted greater by these lifestyle changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study showed a good level of knowledge
regarding COVID-19 and its prevention. Nevertheless, they reported an increase in
unhealthy habits that may have important health consequences in the long term and
should be addressed by public health interventions targeted at older people.
