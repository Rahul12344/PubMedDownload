As COVID-19 vaccination is being undertaken all over the world, its side effects 
are materializing slowly. One such emerging side effect is acute graft rejection 
in corneal transplant (CT) cases post COVID-19 vaccination. We report a case of
left eye (LE) repeat penetrating keratoplasty presenting with diminished vision
in LE within 2 days of COVID-19 vaccination (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Corona Virus Vaccine
Recombinant, COVISHIELDâ„¢). The patient was diagnosed with acute graft rejection
post vaccination and was treated with topical and systemic immunosuppression
therapy with successful outcome in terms improvement of visual acuity and corneal
graft clarity. Timely presentation, diagnosis, and management may help to survive
acute rejection episodes post vaccination.
