Objective Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin have 
been shown to be independent markers of cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to
assess the correlation between serum levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein 
and cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes. Methods We carried out a
cross-sectional study at a tertiary level reference hospital in Yaounde,
Cameroon. We assessed the cardiovascular risk using the Action in Diabetes and
Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE)
cardiovascular risk prediction model in 80 adults with type 2 diabetes. Serum
procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were measured in 80 and 76 subjects
respectively, using a highly sensitive quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) method. Correlations were examined using Spearman's rank
correlation test and the correlation coefficients were compared using the Z-test 
statistic. Results Females represented the majority of the study population
(62.5%). The median duration of diabetes was 5 (3-10) years and 62.5% of
participants had a high cardiovascular risk score. Median serum procalcitonin
levels was significantly higher in females compared to male participants: 2.48
(1.76-3.01 ng/mL) vs 1.42 (0.86-1.87 ng/mL); p<0.001. There was no difference in 
the serum C-reactive protein levels between females and males: 1.20 (0.33-3.33)
mg/L vs 0.85 (0.36-2.77) mg/L; p=0.669. Procalcitonin was moderately correlated
with cardiovascular risk (r=0.58, p<0.001). The correlation was slightly higher
in females (R=0.56, p<0.001) versus males (R=0.49, p=0.005) although not
significantly different (Z-statistic=0.734, p=0.463). Serum C-reactive protein
did not show a meaningful correlation with cardiovascular risk (R=0.23, p=0.050).
At a threshold of 2 ng/ml, serum procalcitonin identified participants with a
high cardiovascular risk score, with a sensitivity and specificity of 64% and 80%
respectively. Conclusion Compared to C-reactive protein, procalcitonin may be a
better surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk prediction in this population
with type 2 diabetes.
