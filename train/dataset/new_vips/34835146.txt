Dual vaccines (n = 6) against both lumpy skin disease (LSD) and bovine ephemeral 
fever (BEF) were constructed, based on the BEFV glycoprotein (G) gene, with or
without the BEFV matrix (M) protein gene, inserted into one of two different LSDV
backbones, nLSDV∆SOD-UCT or nLSDVSODis-UCT. The inserted gene cassettes were
confirmed by PCR; and BEFV protein was shown to be expressed by
immunofluorescence. The candidate dual vaccines were initially tested in a rabbit
model; neutralization assays using the South African BEFV vaccine (B-Phemeral)
strain showed an African consensus G protein gene (Gb) to give superior
neutralization compared to the Australian (Ga) gene. The two LSDV backbones
expressing both Gb and M BEFV genes were tested in cattle and shown to elicit
neutralizing responses to LSDV as well as BEFV after two inoculations 4 weeks
apart. The vaccines were safe in cattle and all vaccinated animals were protected
against virulent LSDV challenge, unlike a group of control naïve animals, which
developed clinical LSD. Both neutralizing and T cell responses to LSDV were
stimulated upon challenge. After two inoculations, all vaccinated animals
produced BEFV neutralizing antibodies ≥ 1/20, which is considered protective for 
BEF.
