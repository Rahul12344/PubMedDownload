Human noroviruses are a common pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis worldwide. 
Among all norovirus genotypes, GII.3 is particularly prevalent in the pediatric
population. Here we report the identification of two distinct blockade antibody
epitopes on the GII.3 capsid. We generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) from mice immunized with virus-like particle (VLP) of a GII.3 cluster 3
strain. Two of these mAbs, namely 8C7 and 8D1, specifically bound the parental
GII.3 VLP but not VLPs of GII.4, GII.17, or GI.1. In addition, 8C7 and 8D1
efficiently blocked GII.3 VLP binding with its ligand, histo-blood group antigens
(HBGA). These data demonstrate that 8C7 and 8D1 are GII.3-specific blockade
antibodies. By using a series of chimeric VLPs, we mapped the epitopes of 8C7 and
8D1 to residues 385-400 and 401-420 of the VP1 capsid protein, respectively.
These two blockade antibody epitopes are highly conserved among GII.3 cluster 3
strains. Structural modeling shows that the 8C7 epitope partially overlaps with
the HBGA binding site (HBS) while the 8D1 epitope is spatially adjacent to HBS.
These findings may enhance our understanding of the immunology and evolution of
GII.3 noroviruses.
