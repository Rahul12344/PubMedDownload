BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people worldwide. In Spain, the
first wave was especially severe.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify sources and levels of distress among
Spanish primary care physicians (PCPs) during the first wave of the pandemic
(April 2020).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey that included
sociodemographic data, a description of working conditions related to distress
[such as gaps in training in protective measures, cleaning, and hygiene
procedures in work setting, unavailability of personal protective equipments
(PPEs) and COVID-19 RT-PCR test, and lack of staff due to be infected] and a
validated scale, the 'Self-applied Acute Stress Scale' (EASE). The survey was
answered by a non-probability sampling of PCPs working in family healthcare
centres from different regions of Spain. Analysis of variance and multivariate
linear regression analysis were performed.
RESULTS: In all, out of 518 PCP participants, 123 (23.7%) obtained high
psychological distress scores. Only half of them had received information about
the appropriate use of PPE. PCP characteristics associated with higher levels of 
distress include female gender [1.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 2.84];
lack of training in protective measures (1.96; 95% CI 0.94, 2.99); unavailable
COVID-19 RT-PCR for health care workers after quarantine or COVID-19 treatment
(-0.77 (-1.52, -0.02). Reinforcing disinfection of the work environment (P <
0.05), availability of PPEs (P < 0.05), and no healthcare professional was
infected (P < 0.05) were related to the lowest distress score.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the sources of distress among PCPs could
prevent its effect on future outbreaks.
