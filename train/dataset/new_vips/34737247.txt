PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the factors influencing COVID-19
vaccination intentions in nurses.
METHODS: The participants were 184 nurses in Korea. Data were collected using a
Google Form online survey method in February, 2021, and analyzed using an
independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression
analysis with the SPSS/WIN 26.0 program.
RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination intention in nurses was correlated significantly
with vaccine hesitancy (r = .58, p < .001), risk perception of COVID-19 (r =.22, 
p = .003), perception of vaccination as a professional duty (r = .59, p < .001), 
and attitude towards workplace infection control policies (r = .20, p = .007).
Vaccine hesitancy (β = .40, p < .001) and the perception of vaccination as a
professional duty (β = .44, p < .001) significantly influenced COVID-19
vaccination intention. The model developed in this study explained 50% of the
variation in COVID-19 vaccination intention.
CONCLUSION: Improving the perception of vaccination as a professional duty and
lowering vaccine hesitancy may enhance nurses' COVID-19 vaccination intention.
Above all, it is necessary to provide programs to encourage voluntary recognition
of vaccination as a professional duty and develop strategies to reduce hesitancy 
toward COVID-19 vaccinations.
