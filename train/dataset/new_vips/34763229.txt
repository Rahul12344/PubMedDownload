Bain type X-linked mental retardation syndrome is an X-linked dominant
neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by psychomotor developmental delay and 
intellectual disability. The rare syndrome is caused by HNRNPH2 gene mutation. In
this study, the iPSC cell line (SMCPGi001-A) was acquired by Sendai
virus-mediated iPSC reprogramming from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) obtained from a 1-year-old girl with de novo p.R206W mutation in the
HNRNPH2 gene. The identification experiments of stemness and differentiation
potential of three germ layers showed that the cell line had pluripotent stem
cell characteristics and the potential of tridermal differentiation.
