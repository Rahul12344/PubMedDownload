Herein it is proposed that sufficient exposure to sunlight (UVB) modulates host
gene expression, offering protection against severe consequences of COVID-19.
This could be in addition to sunlight (UVB)-mediated protection by directly
inactivating the virus and limiting the viral load. It is suggested that
inhibition of CCR2, DPP9, HSPA1L, IFNAR2, OAS1, and TYK2 may, in part, explain
UVB-mediated protection against severe consequences of COVID-19.
