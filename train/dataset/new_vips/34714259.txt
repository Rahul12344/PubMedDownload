The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thoroughly and deeply
affected the provision of healthcare services worldwide. In order to limit the
in-hospital infections and to redistribute the healthcare professionals, cardiac 
percutaneous intervention in Pediatric and Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) 
patients were limited to urgent or emergency ones. The aim of this article is to 
describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Pediatric and ACHD cath
laboratory activity during the so-called 'hard lockdown' in Italy. Eleven out of 
12 Italian institutions with a dedicated Invasive Cardiology Unit in Congenital
Heart Disease actively participated in the survey. The interventional cardiology 
activity was reduced by more than 50% in 6 out of 11 centers. Adolescent and ACHD
patients suffered the highest rate of reduction. There was an evident discrepancy
in the management of the hard lockdown, irrespective of the number of COVID-19
positive cases registered, with a higher reduction in Southern Italy compared
with the most affected regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto and Emilia Romagna).
Although the pandemic was brilliantly addressed in most cases, we recognize the
necessity for planning new, and hopefully homogeneous, strategies in order to be 
prepared for an upcoming new outbreak.
