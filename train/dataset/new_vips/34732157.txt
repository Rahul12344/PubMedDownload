BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza can circulate in parallel with coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) in winter. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of
co-infection and the burden it poses on healthcare system calls for timely
influenza vaccination among pregnant women, who are the priority population
recommended for vaccination. We aimed to evaluate the acceptance of influenza
vaccination and associated factors among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic,
provide evidence to improve influenza vaccination among pregnant women, help
reduce the risk of infection and alleviate the burden of healthcare system for
co-infected patients.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-center cross-sectional study among pregnant women
in China. Sociodemographic characteristics, health status, knowledge on
influenza, attitude towards vaccination, and health beliefs were collected.
Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression analysis was used to evaluate
the trends in the acceptance of influenza vaccine. Logistic regression was
applied to identify factors associated with vaccination acceptance.
RESULTS: The total acceptance rate was 76.5% (95%CI: 74.8-78.1%) among 2568
pregnant women enrolled. Only 8.3% of the participants had a history of seasonal 
influenza vaccination. In the logistic regression model, factors associated with 
the acceptance of influenza vaccine were western region, history of influenza
vaccination, high knowledge of influenza infection and vaccination, high level of
perceived susceptibility, perceived benefit, cues to action and low level of
perceived barriers. Among 23.5% of the participants who had vaccine hesitancy,
48.0% of them were worried about side effect, 35.6% of them lacked confidence of 
vaccine safety.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted that tailored strategies and publicity for 
influenza vaccination in the context of COVID-19 pandemic are warranted to reduce
pregnant women's concerns, improve their knowledge, expand vaccine uptake and
alleviate pressure for healthcare system.
