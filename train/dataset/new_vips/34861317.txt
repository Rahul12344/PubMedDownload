In Picornavirus, the VP4 gene is located inside the viral capsid, but the
antibodies it produces have neutralizing activity. At the same time, we know that
the VP4 gene is relatively conserved among the four structural proteins, which
makes the usage VP4 protein-based antigen potentially meaningful. Therefore, we
used purified duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHVA-1) recombinant VP4 protein as
the coating antigen to establish an indirect method. The optimal antigen, serum
and enzyme-labeled antibody dilutions were 1:400 (3.375 μg/mL), 1:80 and 1:1600, 
respectively. The optimal blocking buffer was 1% skimmed milk powder. The cutoff 
value was determined to be 0.203, and the analytical sensitivity was 1:1600. The 
established ELISA method has good specificity, repeatability and sensitivity. It 
has a high coincidence rate of 70.8 % with the DHVA-1 as the coating antigen. So,
it can be used for the detection of DHAV-1 serum antibodies.
