Sirt7 is one member of the sirtuin family proteins with NAD (NAD+)-dependent
histone deacetylase activity. In this study, we report that zebrafish sirt7 is
induced upon viral infection, and overexpression of sirt7 suppresses cellular
antiviral responses. Disruption of sirt7 in zebrafish increases the survival rate
upon spring viremia of carp virus infection. Further assays indicate that sirt7
interacts with irf3 and irf7 and attenuates phosphorylation of irf3 and irf7 by
preventing tbk1 binding to irf3 and irf7. In addition, the enzymatic activity of 
sirt7 is not required for sirt7 to repress IFN-1 activation. To our knowledge,
this study provides novel insights into sirt7 function and sheds new light on the
regulation of irf3 and irf7 by attenuating phosphorylation.
