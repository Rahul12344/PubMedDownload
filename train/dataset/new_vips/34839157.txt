The HIV-1 invasion is initiated with the interaction of viral glycoprotein gp120 
and cellular receptor CD4. The binding mechanism reveals two major hotspots
involved in gp120-CD4 interaction. The first one is a hydrophobic cavity (Phe43
cavity) on gp120 capped with phenyl ring of phe43CD4 and the second is the
electrostatic interaction between positive charge of Arg59CD4 and negative charge
of Asp368gp120. Targeting these hotspots, small molecules for entry inhibition
and HIV-1 neutralization were designed and tested. In the process, pyrimidine
derivatives were identified as potent molecules to intercept gp120-CD4 binding by
targeting both the hotspots. Herein, the synthesis, characterization of
1,2,3,4-Tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives, and biological evaluation on 93IN101, a
clade C virus are presented. The paper presents a novel set of entry inhibitors
to target dual hotspots on gp120 to inhibit protein-protein interactions.
