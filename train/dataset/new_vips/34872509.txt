BACKGROUND: Depending on geographic location, causes of encephalitis,
meningoencephalitis and meningitis vary substantially. We aimed to identify the
most frequent causes, clinical presentation and long-term outcome of
encephalitis, meningoencephalitis and meningitis cases treated in the Inselspital
University Hospital Bern, Switzerland.
METHODS: In this monocentric, observational study, we performed a retrospective
review of clinical patient records for all patients treated within a 3-year
period. Patients were contacted for a telephone follow-up interview and to fill
out questionnaires, especially related to disturbances of sleep and wakefulness.
RESULTS: We included 258 patients with the following conditions: encephalitis
(18%), nonbacterial meningoencephalitis (42%), nonbacterial meningitis (27%) and 
bacterial meningoencephalitis/meningitis (13%). Herpes simplex virus (HSV) was
the most common cause of encephalitis (18%); tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)
was the most common cause of nonbacterial meningoencephalitis (46%), enterovirus 
was the most common cause of nonbacterial meningitis (21%) and Streptococcus
pneumoniae was the most common cause of bacterial meningoencephalitis/meningitis 
(49%). Overall, 35% patients remained without a known cause. After a median time 
of 16 months, 162 patients participated in the follow-up interview; 56% reported 
suffering from neurological long-term sequelae such as fatigue and/or excessive
daytime sleepiness (34%), cognitive impairment and memory deficits (22%),
headache (14%) and epileptic seizures (11%).
CONCLUSIONS: In the Bern region, Switzerland, TBEV was the overall most
frequently detected infectious cause, with a clinical manifestation of
meningoencephalitis in the majority of cases. Long-term neurological sequelae,
most importantly cognitive impairment, fatigue and headache, were frequently
self-reported not only in encephalitis and meningoencephalitis survivors but also
in viral meningitis survivors up to 40 months after acute infection.
