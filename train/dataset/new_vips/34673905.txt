Purpose: The putative presence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular specimen puts healthcare
workers at risk. We thoroughly examined conjunctival swabs and tear fluid in a
large cohort of COVID-19 patients.
Methods: A total of 243 symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were
included in this observational multicenter study. Conjunctival swabs were
analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were
performed to identify viral strains and to determine tissue tropism. Schirmer
tear samples from 43 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy controls were 
analyzed by multiplex cytokine immunoassays.
Results: Viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in conjunctival swabs from 17 (7.0%)
of 243 COVID-19 patients. Conjunctival samples were positive for viral SARS-CoV-2
RNA as long as 12 days after disease onset. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for
conjunctival swabs (mean 34.5 ± 5.1) were significantly higher than
nasopharyngeal swabs (mean 16.7 ± 3.6). No correlation between Ct values of
conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs was observed. The majority of positive
conjunctival samples were detected only once and primarily during the first
visit. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the virus strain found
in the conjunctiva was most often identical to the one found in the nasopharynx. 
Tear cytokine levels IL-1β and IL-6 were elevated in COVID-19 patients compared
to healthy controls.
Conclusions: Conjunctival samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained
the same viral strain as the nasopharynx.
Translational Relevance: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and elevated
cytokines in tear fluid confirm the involvement of the ocular surface in COVID-19
disease.
