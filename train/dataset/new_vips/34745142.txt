Duck viral hepatitis (DVH) is an acute, highly lethal infectious disease of
ducklings that causes huge losses in the duck industry. Duck hepatitis A virus
genotype 3 (DHAV-3) has been one of the most prevalent DVH pathogen in the Asian 
duck industry in recent years. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of the
resistance and susceptibility of ducks to DVH by comparing the genomes and
transcriptomes of a resistant Pekin duck flock (Z8) and a susceptible Pekin duck 
flock (SZ7). Our comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested that
NOD1 showed a strong signal of association with DVH susceptibility in ducks.
Then, we found that NOD1 showed a significant expression difference between the
livers of susceptible and resistant individuals after infection with DHAV-3, with
higher expression in the SZ7 flock. Furthermore, suppression and overexpression
experiments showed that the number of DHAV-3 genomic copies in primary duck
hepatocytes was influenced by the expression level of NOD1. In addition, in situ 
RNAscope analysis showed that the localization of NOD1 and DHAV-3 in liver cells 
was consistent. Altogether, our data suggested that NOD1 was likely associated
with DHAV-3 susceptibility in ducks, which provides a target for future
investigations of the pathogenesis of DVH.
