BACKGROUND: Akabane virus (AKAV) is an important insect-borne virus which is
widely distributed throughout the world except the Europe and is considered as a 
great threat to herbivore health.
RESULTS: An AKAV strain defined as TJ2016 was firstly isolated from the bovine
sera in China in 2016. Sequence analysis of the S and M segments suggested that
the isolated AKAV strain was closely related to the AKAV strains JaGAr39 and
JaLAB39, which belonged to AKAV genogroup II. To further study the pathogenic
mechanism of AKAV, the full-length cDNA clone of TJ2016 S, M, and L segment was
constructed separately into the TVT7R plasmid at the downsteam of T7 promoter and
named as TVT7R-S, TVT7R-M, and TVT7R-L, respectively. The above three plasmids
were further transfected into the BSR-T7/5 cells simultaneously with a ratio of
1:1:1 to produce the rescued virus AKAV. Compared with the parental wild type
AKAV (wtAKAV), the rescued virus (rAKAV) was proved to be with similar cytopathic
effects (CPE), plaque sizes and growth kinetics in BHK-21 cells.
CONCLUSION: We successfully isolated a AKAV strain TJ2016 from the sera of cattle
and established a reverse genetic platform for AKAV genome manipulation. The
established reverse genetic system is also a powerful tool for further research
on AKAV pathogenesis and even vaccine studies.
