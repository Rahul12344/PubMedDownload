Flavonoids are important secondary plant metabolites that have been studied for a
long time for their therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases because of
their cytokine-modulatory effects. Five flavonoid aglycones were isolated and
identified from the hydrolyzed aqueous methanol extracts of Anastatica
hierochuntica L., Citrus reticulata Blanco, and Kickxia aegyptiaca (L.) Nabelek. 
They were identified as taxifolin (1), pectolinarigenin (2), tangeretin (3),
gardenin B (4), and hispidulin (5). These structures were elucidated based on
chromatographic and spectral analysis. In this study, molecular docking studies
were carried out for the isolated and identified compounds against SARS-CoV-2
main protease (Mpro) compared to the co-crystallized inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
(α-ketoamide inhibitor (KI), IC50 = 66.72 µg/mL) as a reference standard.
Moreover, in vitro screening against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated. Compounds 2 and 3 
showed the highest virus inhibition with IC50 12.4 and 2.5 µg/mL, respectively.
Our findings recommend further advanced in vitro and in vivo studies of the
examined isolated flavonoids, especially pectolinarigenin (2), tangeretin (3),
and gardenin B (4), either alone or in combination with each other to identify a 
promising lead to target SARS-CoV-2 effectively. This is the first report of the 
activity of these compounds against SARS-CoV-2.
