Targeting protein therapeutics to specific cells and tissues is a major challenge
in modern medicine. Improving the specificity of protein therapeutic delivery
will significantly enhance efficiency in drug development. One of the promising
tools for protein delivery is extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are enveloped by 
a complex lipid bilayer. EVs are secreted by almost all cell types and possess
significant advantages: biocompatibility, stability, and the ability to penetrate
the blood-brain barrier. Overexpression of the vesicular stomatitis virus protein
G (VSV-G) was shown to promote EV formation by the producer cell. We have
developed an EV-based system for targeted delivery of protein cargoes to
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this study, we show that attachment of a
recombinant llama nanobody α-CD206 to the N-terminus of a truncated VSV-G
increases the selectivity of EV cargo delivery mainly to APCs. These results
highlight the outstanding technological and biomedical potential of EV-based
delivery systems for correcting the immune response in patients with autoimmune, 
viral, and oncological diseases.
