Individuals with pre-existing chronic systemic low-grade inflammation are prone
to develop severe COVID-19 and stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.
Whether this phenomenon reflects a differential expansion of antiviral B cells or
a failure to regulate antibody synthesis remains unknown. Here, we compared the
antiviral B cell repertoire of convalescent healthcare personnel to that of
hospitalized patients with pre-existing comorbidities. Out of 277,500
immortalized B cell clones, antiviral B cell frequencies were determined by
indirect immunofluorescence screening on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Surprisingly,
frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 specific clones from the two groups were not
statistically different, despite higher antibody levels in hospitalized patients.
Moreover, functional analyses revealed that several B cell clones from healthcare
personnel with low antibody levels had neutralizing properties. This study
reveals for the first time a key qualitative defect of antibody synthesis in
severe patients and calls for caution regarding estimated protective immunity
based only on circulating antiviral antibodies.
