OBJECTIVE: To detect the binding of Mage-D1 with activated p75NTR and explore
their role in regulating mineralization of ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs).
METHODS: EMSCs were isolated from the tooth germs of embryonic SD rats (19.5 days
of gestation) by tissue explant culture and were identified for surface markers
using flow cytometry. The cultured cells were divided into blank control group,
100 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation group, and lentivirus-mediated
Mage-D1 interference (SH-Mage-D1) group. Proximity ligation assay was used to
detect the binding of Mage-D1 with activated p75NTR in the EMSCs, and the binding
strength was compared among the 3 groups. Alizarin red staining and ALP staining 
were used to observe mineralization of the induced cells. The expressions of ALP,
Runx2, OCN, BSP, OPN, Msx1 and Dlx1 at both the mRNA and protein levels were
detected using RT-PCR and Western blotting.
RESULTS: The isolated EMSCs expressed high levels of cell surface markers CD44,
CD90, CD29, CD146, and CD105 with a low expression of CD45. The results of
proximity ligation assay showed that the binding of Mage-D1 with activated p75NTR
in the cells increased over time, and the binding strength was significantly
greater in NFG-treated cells than in the cells in the other two groups (P <
0.05). Alizarin red staining and ALP staining of the induced cells showed that
the changes in the mineralization nodules were consistent with those of ALP
activity. The cells treated with 100 ng/mL NGF exhibited significantly increased 
expressions of ALP, Runx2, OCN, BSP, OPN, Col1, Msx1 and Dlx1 as compared with
the cells in the other two groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Mage-D1 directly binds to activated p75NTR in embryonic rat EMSCs to 
positively regulate the mineralization of the EMSCs.
