Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. In addition to unfavorable
perinatal outcomes, there has been an increase in obstetric interventions. With
this study, we aimed to clarify the reasons, using Robson's classification model,
and risk factors for cesarean section (C-section) in SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers 
and their perinatal results. This was a prospective observational study that was 
carried out in 79 hospitals (Spanish Obstetric Emergency Group) with a cohort of 
1704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive pregnant women that were registered consecutively
between 26 February and 5 November 2020. The data from 1248 pregnant women who
delivered vaginally (vaginal + operative vaginal) was compared with those from
456 (26.8%) who underwent a C-section. C-section patients were older with higher 
rates of comorbidities, in vitro fertilization and multiple pregnancies (p <
0.05) compared with women who delivered vaginally. Moreover, C-section risk was
associated with the presence of pneumonia (p < 0.001) and 41.1% of C-sections in 
patients with pneumonia were preterm (Robson's 10th category). However, delivery 
care was similar between asymptomatic and mild-moderate symptomatic patients (p =
0.228) and their predisposing factors to C-section were the presence of uterine
scarring (due to a previous C-section) and the induction of labor or programmed
C-section for unspecified obstetric reasons. On the other hand, higher rates of
hemorrhagic events, hypertensive disorders and thrombotic events were observed in
the C-section group (p < 0.001 for all three outcomes), as well as for ICU
admission. These findings suggest that this type of delivery was associated with 
the mother's clinical conditions that required a rapid and early termination of
pregnancy.
