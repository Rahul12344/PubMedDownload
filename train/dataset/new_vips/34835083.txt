Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) tegument protein pp150 is essential for the
completion of the final steps in virion maturation. Earlier studies indicated
that three pp150nt (N-terminal one-third of pp150) conformers cluster on each
triplex (Tri1, Tri2A and Tri2B), and extend towards small capsid proteins atop
nearby major capsid proteins, forming a net-like layer of tegument densities that
enmesh and stabilize HCMV capsids. Based on this atomic detail, we designed
several peptides targeting pp150nt. Our data show significant reduction in virus 
growth upon treatment with one of these peptides (pep-CR2) with an IC50 of 1.33
Î¼M and no significant impact on cell viability. Based on 3D modeling, pep-CR2
specifically interferes with the pp150-capsid binding interface. Cells
pre-treated with pep-CR2 and infected with HCMV sequester pp150 in the nucleus,
indicating a mechanistic disruption of pp150 loading onto capsids and subsequent 
nuclear egress. Furthermore, pep-CR2 effectively inhibits mouse cytomegalovirus
(MCMV) infection in cell culture, paving the way for future animal testing.
Combined, these results indicate that CR2 of pp150 is amenable to targeting by a 
peptide inhibitor, and can be developed into an effective antiviral.
