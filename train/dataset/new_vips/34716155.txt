OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff comparing to
preprocedural patients in Thai community hospitals to shed light on the situation
of COVID-19 infection of frontline healthcare workers in low infection rate
countries where mass screening was not readily available.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: 52 community hospitals in 35 provinces covered all regions of Thailand.
PARTICIPANTS: 857 participants consisted of 675 hospital staff and 182
preprocedural patients.
OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 seroprevalence using a locally developed rapid IgM/IgG 
test kit RESULTS: Overall, 5.5% of the participants (47 of 857) had positive IgM,
0.2% (2 of 857) had positive IgG which both of them also had positive IgM.
Hospitals located in the central part of Thailand had the highest IgM
seroprevalence (11.9%). Preprocedural patients had a higher rate of positive IgM 
than the hospital staff (12.1% vs 3.7%). Participants with present upper
respiratory tract symptoms had a higher rate of positive IgM than those without
(9.6% vs 4.5%). Three quarters (80.5%, 690 of 857) of the participants were
asymptomatic, of which, 31 had positive IgM (4.5%) which consisted of 20 of 566
healthcare workers (3.5%) and 11 of 124 preprocedural patients (8.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 antibody test could detect a substantial number of
potential silent spreaders in Thai community hospitals where the nasopharyngeal
PCR was not readily available, and the antigen test was prohibited. Antibody
testing should be encouraged for mass screening in a limited resource setting,
especially in asymptomatic individuals.
