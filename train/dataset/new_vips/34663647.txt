OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of cancers in adolescents and young adults
(AYAs) living with and without HIV in South Africa.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with cancer records provided by the National Cancer
Registry (NCR) and HIV records from the National Health Laboratory Service
(NHLS).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The NHLS is the largest provider of pathology services 
in the South African public sector. The NCR is a division of the NHLS. We
included AYAs (aged 10-24 years) diagnosed with cancer by public health sector
laboratories between 2004 and 2014 (n=8479). HIV status was obtained through
record linkages and text mining.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: We determined the spectrum of cancers by HIV
status in AYAs. We used multivariable logistic regression to describe the
association of cancer in AYAs with HIV, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and
calendar period. We imputed (post hoc) the HIV status for AYA with unknown HIV
status.
RESULTS: 8479 AYAs were diagnosed with cancer, HIV status was known for 45%
(n=3812). Of those whose status was known, about half were HIV positive (n=1853).
AYAs living with HIV were more likely to have Kaposi's sarcoma (adjusted OR (aOR)
218, 95% CI 89.9 to 530), cervical cancer (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.89),
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.66) and anogenital cancers
other than cervix (aOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.27 to 5.86) than AYAs without HIV. About
44% (n=1062) of AYAs with HIV-related cancers had not been tested for HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted HIV testing for AYAs diagnosed with cancer, followed by
immediate start of antiretroviral therapy, screening for cervical precancer and
vaccination against human papilloma virus is needed to decrease cancer burden in 
AYAs living with HIV in South Africa.
