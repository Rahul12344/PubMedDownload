Introduction: Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, the respiratory system has
been the chief focus of researches, however, understanding the impact of this
disease on the integumentary system is just as essential.
Objectives: We aimed at collecting data on any cutaneous manifestation arising in
patients with active and recovering COVID-19 infection, or a direct consequence
of the infection's treatment, and correlating these findings with systemic
disease severity and duration.
Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in three
tertiary care centers from Rajasthan, India, to acquire data of
laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 presenting with any mucocutaneous
manifestation.
Results: Eight predominant patterns of dermatological involvement were seen,
namely, maculopapular (14.59%), urticarial (13.17%), perniotic (12.1%),
pityriasis rosea (11.74%), acral erythema/edema (10.3%), petechial (4.63%),
vesicular (2.49%), and livedo (1.78%). Rare findings included eruptive
pseudoangioma, eruptive hypomelanosis, alopecia parvimaculata, geographic tongue,
chikungunya-like hyperpigmentation, and nail changes. On correlating these
findings with the gradient of the disease, livedo, vasculitis, exfoliation, and
erythroderma were associated with severe disease, whereas perniosis and eruptive 
pseudoangioma were seen in mild illness.
Conclusion: We reported a few previously unpublished skin manifestations of
COVID-19, namely, geographic tongue, chikungunya-like pigmentation, eruptive
hypomelanosis, and alopecia parvimaculata. This study provides a visual
description of the muco-cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease which could 
aid a dermatologist or physician in early diagnosis of this novel infection,
especially in a resource-poor setting.
