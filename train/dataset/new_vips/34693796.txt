Introduction: Peru has experienced one of the highest rates of COVID-19 with only
27% of the population vaccinated. College students must make decisions on
vaccination based on their belief and knowledge about immunizations. The purpose 
of this study was to describe COVID-19 behaviors and beliefs toward immunization 
among college students in Lima, Peru. Methods: Undergraduate students from
Universidad Maria Auxiliadora (UMA) participated in this descriptive study. The
CDC National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey was adapted to measure behaviors and beliefs
about immunizations of COVID-19. Results: 818 students participated in the study 
during the 2020 academic year. Significant differences were identified about
taking vaccine when it was available by age (p = .02), gender (p < .001), marital
status (p = .004), and income (p = .002). Significant associations were found
between participants' ethnicity and location of last vaccination (p < .001) and
race and reason to not receive the COVID-19 vaccine (p < .001). Conclusions:
Peruvian students under the age of 32 are not eligible for the COVID-19 at this
time. Findings can prepare academic institutions to promote education about the
vaccine in this age group who have unique barriers in receiving health care and
vaccinations.
