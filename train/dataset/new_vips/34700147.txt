Equid herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) outbreaks occur when virus spreads from infected
horses to in-contact horses, primarily via nasal shedding. This study evaluated
the efficacy of factors secreted by equine peripheral blood derived mesenchymal
stromal cells (PB-MSCs), collectively named the secretome, to inhibit the growth 
of EHV-1 in (i) 2D epithelial cell cultures (RK-13) in vitro, (ii) 3D equine
nasal explants in vitro and (iii) an EHV-1 infection mouse model in vivo. The
PB-MSC secretome was found to inhibit EHV-1 in RK-13 cells as well as in the
epithelium of equine nasal explants. Although the PB-MSC secretome did not
decrease overall severity of EHV-1 infection in mice, as determined by weight
loss and viral titers in lungs, histological analyses indicated local reduction
of EHV-1 infection in nasal epithelium. These results indicate that the PB-MSC
secretome inhibits EHV-1 in epithelial cells in a context-dependent manner.
