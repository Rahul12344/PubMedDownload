During the past 18 months as the world dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, articles
published in Cell Transplantation (CT) voiced unique perspectives on the disease 
which have since been supported by additional research. Intrigued by the
variability in COVID-19 severity, CT authors explored the influence of variants
in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2
(TMPRSS2) genes, as well as the role of androgen receptors on disease
development. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were offered up as a potential COVID-19
therapy because of their immune modulating characteristics and successful use in 
other acute respiratory diseases. Two CT author groups gave proof of principle
when hospitalized COVID-19 patients were infused with MSC after no other
interventions seemed to work. MSC treatment reduced disease severity and
shortened hospitalization stays. Lastly, CT authors speculated why we are still
in the midst of a pandemic and the consequences of disillusioned comfort as we
face new emerging variants that may undermine all we have accomplished thus far.
