Developing influenza vaccines that protect against a broad range of viruses is a 
global health priority. Several conserved viral proteins or domains have been
identified as promising targets for such vaccine development. However, none of
the targets is sufficiently immunogenic to elicit complete protection, and
vaccine platforms that can enhance immunogenicity and deliver multiple antigens
are desperately needed. Here, we report proof-of-concept studies for the
development of next-generation influenza vaccines using the bacteriophage T4
virus-like particle (VLP) platform. Using the extracellular domain of influenza
matrix protein 2 (M2e) as a readout, we demonstrate that up to ~1,281 M2e
molecules can be assembled on a 120 x 86 nanometer phage capsid to generate
M2e-T4 VLPs. These M2e-decorated nanoparticles, without any adjuvant, are highly 
immunogenic, stimulate robust humoral as well as cellular immune responses, and
conferred complete protection against lethal influenza virus challenge.
Potentially, additional conserved antigens could be incorporated into the M2e-T4 
VLPs and mass-produced in E. coli in a short amount of time to deal with an
emerging influenza pandemic.
