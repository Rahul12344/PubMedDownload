The COVID-19 pandemic was and still is a global burden with more than 178,000,000
cases reported so far. Although it mainly affects respiratory organs, COVID-19
has many extrapulmonary manifestations, including, among other things, liver
injury. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain direct and indirect impacts
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the liver. Studies have shown that around 15-30% of
patients with COVID-19 have underlying liver disease, and 20-35% of patients with
COVID-19 had altered liver enzymes at admission. One of the hypotheses is
reactivation of an underlying liver disease, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). Some studies have shown that NAFLD is associated with severe
COVID-19 and poor outcome; nevertheless, other studies showed no significant
difference between groups in comparing complications and clinical outcomes.
Patients with NAFLD may suffer severe COVID-19 due to other comorbidities,
especially cardiovascular diseases. The link between NAFLD and COVID-19 is not
clear yet, and further studies and research are needed.
