Viral skin infections often affect the sports community. The aim of this study
was to assess the rates, location sites, and seasons of appearance of common
viral cutaneous diseases in beach volleyball athletes in Greece. Five hundred and
forty-nine beach volleyball athletes participated in this study. The average age 
was 28.4 years. The viral infections were herpes simplex (type 1), molluscum
contagiosum and warts. The measured parameters included: gender, age, the season 
when athletes may be more susceptible to infections and the location of infection
in the body. Practicing information such as the number of training years, number 
of weekly trainings, and average hours of daily training was also recorded.
Incidence rates correlated in relation to age: (a) warts (p < 0.001), molluscum
contagiosum (p < 0.001), and herpes simplex (p = 0.001); (b) years of training:
warts (p < 0.001), molluscum contagiosum (p < 0.001), and herpes simplex (p =
0.004); (c) average hours of daily training: molluscum contagiosum (p = 0.006)
and herpes simplex (p < 0.010). The skin is the largest organ, and the risk of
infection should not be underestimated. Prevention, early detection, recognition,
and treatment are related to health and athletic performance, but also to the
risk of transmission.
