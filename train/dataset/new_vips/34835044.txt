The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that impacted 200+ countries. India
ranks in the second and third positions in terms of number of reported cases and 
deaths. Being a populous country with densely packed cities, SARS-CoV-2 spread
exponentially. India sequenced ≈0.14% isolates from confirmed cases for pandemic 
surveillance and contributed ≈1.58% of complete genomes sequenced globally. This 
study was designed to map the circulating lineage diversity and to understand the
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in India using comparative genomics and population
genetics approaches. Despite varied sequencing coverage across Indian States and 
Union Territories, isolates belonging to variants of concern (VoC) and variants
of interest (VoI) circulated, persisted, and diversified during the first
seventeen months of the pandemic. Delta and Kappa lineages emerged in India and
spread globally. The phylogenetic tree shows lineage-wise monophyletic clusters
of VoCs/VoIs and diversified tree topologies for non-VoC/VoI lineages designated 
as 'Others' in this study. Evolutionary dynamics analyses substantiate a lack of 
spatio-temporal clustering, which is indicative of multiple global and local
introductions. Sites under positive selection and significant variations in spike
protein corroborate with the constellation of mutations to be monitored for
VoC/VoI as well as substitutions that are characteristic of functions with
implications in virus-host interactions, differential glycosylation, immune
evasion, and escape from neutralization.
