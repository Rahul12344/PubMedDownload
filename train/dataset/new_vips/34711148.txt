Background: Health care workers are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due
to potential exposure to patients or staff in health care settings. Australian
health care services and health care workers experienced intense pressure to
prepare for and respond to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We summarise national data on
health care worker infections and associated outbreaks during 2020.
Methods: We collected aggregated data on infected health care workers and
outbreaks in health care facilities from all jurisdictions. Health care workers
working solely in residential aged care and outbreaks in residential aged care
facilities were excluded. Jurisdictions provided data on the number of health
care setting outbreaks, confirmed cases, hospitalisation, source of infection,
and health care worker role. We analysed data for two periods that aligned with
two distinct peaks in the epidemic relative to 1 June 2020, referred to here as
the first wave (23 January - 31 May 2020) and the second wave (1 June - 18
September 2020).
Results: Jurisdictions reported a total of 2,163 health care worker infections
with SARS-CoV-2 during the surveillance period. Source of acquisition was known
for 81.0% of cases (1,667/2,059). The majority of cases in the first wave were
acquired overseas, shifting to locally-acquired cases in the second wave. The
odds of infection in the second wave compared to the first wave were higher for
nurses/midwives (odds ratio, OR: 1.61; 95% confidence interval (95% CI):
1.32-2.00), lower for medical practitioners (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.28-0.47) and did
not differ for 'other' health care workers (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0. 87-1.32). The
odds of infection in the second wave were higher in a health care setting (OR:
1.76; 95% CI: 1.28-2.41) than in the community. There were 120 outbreaks in
health care settings with 1,428 cases, of which 56.7% (809/1,428) were health
care workers. The majority (88/120; 73.8%) of outbreaks in health care settings
occurred in the second wave of the epidemic, with 90.9% of these (80/88)
occurring in Victoria.
Conclusions: In the second wave of the epidemic, when there was heightened
community transmission, health care workers were more likely to be infected in
the workplace. Throughout the epidemic, nurses were more likely to be infected
than staff in other roles.
