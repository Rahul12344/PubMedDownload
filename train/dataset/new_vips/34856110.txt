Atezolizumab Treatment for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy.

Lambert N, Dauby S, Dive D, Sadzot B, Maquet P.

Atezolizumab successfully reinvigorated JC virus immunity in a patient in Belgium
with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, as demonstrated by clinical,
virologic, and radiologic response to treatment. However, the treatment also
resulted in immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and life-threatening
immune-related adverse events. These conditions were treated with
corticosteroids, leading to treatment resistance.
