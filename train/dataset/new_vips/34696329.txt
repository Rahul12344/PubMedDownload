Antibodies targeting the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are essential tools. In addition 
to important roles in the treatment and diagnosis of infection, the availability 
of high-quality specific antibodies for the S and N proteins is essential to
facilitate basic research of virus replication and in the characterization of
mutations responsible for variants of concern. We have developed panels of mouse 
and rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding 
domain (S-RBD) and N protein for functional and antigenic analyses. The mAbs to
the S-RBD were tested for neutralization of native SARS-CoV-2, with several
exhibiting neutralizing activity. The panels of mAbs to the N protein were
assessed for cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS)-CoV N proteins and could be subdivided into sets that showed
unique specificity for SARS-CoV-2 N protein, cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 
and SARS-CoV N proteins only, or cross-reactivity to all three coronavirus N
proteins tested. Partial mapping of N-reactive mAbs were conducted using
truncated fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and revealed near complete
coverage of the N protein. Collectively, these sets of mouse and rabbit
monoclonal antibodies can be used to examine structure/function studies for N
proteins and to define the surface location of virus neutralizing epitopes on the
RBD of the S protein.
