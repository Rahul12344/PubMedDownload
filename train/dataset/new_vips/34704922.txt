Members of the family Herpesviridae have enveloped, spherical virions with
characteristic complex structures consisting of symmetrical and non-symmetrical
components. The linear, double-stranded DNA genomes of 125-241 kbp contain 70-170
genes, of which 43 have been inherited from an ancestral herpesvirus. In general,
herpesviruses have coevolved with and are highly adapted to their hosts, which
comprise many mammalian, avian and reptilian species. Following primary
infection, they are able to establish lifelong latent infection, during which
there is limited viral gene expression. Severe disease is usually observed only
in the foetus, the very young, the immunocompromised or following infection of an
alternative host. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) Report on the family Herpesviridae, which is available at
ictv.global/report/herpesviridae.
