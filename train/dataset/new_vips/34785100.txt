Patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments have a higher need for
protection against coronavirus disease (COVID19) that follows infection with the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus but their ability to respond sufficiently to COVID vaccines is
uncertain. We retrospectively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 (S1)-specific 
antibody levels after two mRNA doses in 242 patients with underlying chronic
inflammatory, hematooncological or metabolic diseases and in solid organ
transplant recipients. S1-specific antibodies were measured 30 days after the
second dose. In 15.9% of these patients, no S1-specific antibodies were
detectable. Non-responsiveness was linked to administration of B-cell depleting
therapies as well as to ongoing therapies that block lymphocyte trafficking
(Fingolimod) or inhibit T cell proliferation (Tacrolimus). Thus, it is important 
to inform immunosuppressed patients about the risk of vaccine non-responsiveness 
and the necessity to maintain non-pharmaceutical protection measures. In these
risk patients antibody testing and cellular analysis are helpful to estimate the 
benefit/responsiveness to further booster vaccinations.
