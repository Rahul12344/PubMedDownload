BACKGROUND: Due to the prevalence and associated adverse health consequences of
negative body image among adolescents globally, there is a need to develop
acceptable, effective, and scalable interventions. School-based body image
interventions delivered by trained teachers show promise in reducing negative
body image in adolescents. However, there is currently a lack of evidenced-based 
body image interventions for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
This paper outlines a protocol for the development and evaluation of Dove
Confident Me Indonesia: Single Session, a single-session, teacher-led body image 
intervention for Indonesian adolescents.
METHOD: The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated using a cluster
randomised controlled trial design. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial will 
be conducted online. Trained teachers or school guidance counsellors will deliver
the intervention. Self-report questionnaires will be collected at three time
points: baseline, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up. The primary outcome
is body esteem. Secondary outcomes are internalisation of appearance ideals,
mood, engagement in life activities, tendency to engage in appearance
comparisons, and skin shade satisfaction. A minimum of 1000 participants will
provide 95% power to detect small-to-medium intervention effects. To account for 
attrition and potential internet issues, the sample will comprise of 2000
Indonesian adolescents in grades 7-9, attending state junior high schools in
Surabaya, East Java. Quantitative and qualitative data on acceptability of the
intervention will also be collected from teachers and students. Additionally,
fidelity of lesson implementation will be assessed. This project received ethical
approval from the Universitas Indonesia and the University of the West of
England. The intervention will be disseminated in junior high schools throughout 
Indonesia via UNICEF's Life Skills Education (LSE) programme, which will be
freely available for teachers to download.
DISCUSSION: This paper presents Dove Confident Me Indonesia: Single Session, a
culturally adapted school-based intervention designed to improve Indonesian
adolescents' body image. It details the plan for evaluation, highlighting the
strengths and limitations of the proposed study design. It will be informative
for others aiming to adapt evidence-based school curricula to promote well-being 
among adolescents in LMICs.
