Adopting international standards within health research communities can elevate
data FAIRness and widen analysis possibilities. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the mapping feasibility against HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources® (FHIR)® of a generic metadata schema (MDS) created for a central
search hub gathering COVID-19 health research (studies, questionnaires, documents
= MDS resource types). Mapping results were rated by calculating the percentage
of FHIR coverage. Among 86 items to map, total mapping coverage was 94%: 50 (58%)
of the items were available as standard resources in FHIR and 31 (36%) could be
mapped using extensions. Five items (6%) could not be mapped to FHIR. Analyzing
each MDS resource type, there was a total mapping coverage of 93% for studies and
95% for questionnaires and documents, with 61% of the MDS items available as
standard resources in FHIR for studies, 57% for questionnaires and 52% for
documents. Extensions in studies, questionnaires and documents were used in 32%, 
38% and 43% of items, respectively. This work shows that FHIR can be used as a
standardized format in registries for clinical, epidemiological and public health
research. However, further adjustments to the initial MDS are recommended - and
two additional items even needed when implementing FHIR. Developing a MDS based
on the FHIR standard could be a future approach to reduce data ambiguity and
foster interoperability.
