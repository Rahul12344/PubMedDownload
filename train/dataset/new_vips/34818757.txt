Relevant energy questions have arisen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
pandemic shock leads to emissions' reductions consistent with the rates of
decrease required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Those unforeseen drastic 
reductions in emissions are temporary as long as they do not involve structural
changes. However, the COVID-19 consequences and the subsequent policy response
will affect the economy for decades. Focusing on the EU, this discussion article 
argues how recovery plans are an opportunity to deepen the way towards a
low-carbon economy, improving at the same time employment, health, and equity and
the role of modelling tools. Long-term alignment with the low-carbon path and the
development of a resilient transition towards renewable sources should guide
instruments and policies, conditioning aid to energy-intensive sectors such as
transport, tourism, and the automotive industry. However, the potential dangers
of short-termism and carbon leakage persist. The current
energy-socio-economic-environmental modelling tools are precious to widen the
scope and deal with these complex problems. The scientific community has to
assess disparate, non-equilibrium, and non-ordinary scenarios, such as sectors
and countries lockdowns, drastic changes in consumption patterns, significant
investments in renewable energies, and disruptive technologies and incorporate
uncertainty analysis. All these instruments will evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of decarbonization options and potential consequences on employment, income
distribution, and vulnerability.
