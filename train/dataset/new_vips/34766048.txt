The on-going SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 discovered in December 2019, is
responsible for a global pandemic. The virus belongs to the group of enveloped
viruses containing linear, non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense strand 
RNA as genetic material. Already six different strains Coronaviruses are being
reported to infect humans, however the seventh one is genetically similar to the 
SARS Coronavirus and termed as SARS-CoV-2. Specific crucial macromolecules such
as membrane, nuclear, spike and enveloped proteins including HE esterase are
present in the virus that interact with ACE2, APN, NEU-5, 9SC2 moiety of humans
plays significant role in occurrence and transmission of the devastating disease.
This review article summarizes the structure, histopathology, transmission of
novel Coronavirus, its symptoms with preventive measures & currently prescribed
drugs. Though various drugs and therapy have been administrated or implemented to
restrict COVID-19, however it is imperative to develop an antidote against
SARS-CoV-2 by the scientific or research community to save life.
