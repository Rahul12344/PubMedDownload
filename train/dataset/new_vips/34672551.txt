Despite the importance of rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, current diagnostic methods are static and
unable to distinguish between viable/nonviable virus or directly reflect viral
replication activity. Real-time imaging of protease activity specific to
SARS-CoV-2 can overcome these issues but remains lacking. Herein, we report a
near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) activatable molecular probe (SARS-CyCD) for
detection of SARS-CoV-2 protease in living mice. The probe comprises a
hemicyanine fluorophore caged with a protease peptide substrate and a
cyclodextrin unit, which function as an NIRF signaling moiety and a
renal-clearable enabler, respectively. The peptide substrate of SARS-CyCD can be 
specifically cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), resulting in NIRF signal
activation and liberation of the renal-clearable fluorescent fragment (CyCD).
Such a design not only allows sensitive detection of Mpro in the lungs of living 
mice after intratracheal administration but also permits optical urinalysis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this study presents an in vivo sensor that holds
potential in preclinical high-throughput drug screening and clinical diagnostics 
for respiratory viral infections.
