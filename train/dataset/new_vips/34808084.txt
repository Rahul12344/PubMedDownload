The 10th and largest Ebola virus disease epidemic in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) was declared in North Kivu Province in August 2018 and ended in
June 2020. We describe and evaluate an Early Warning, Alert and Response System
(EWARS) implemented in the Beni health zone of DRC during August 5, 2018-June 30,
2020. During this period, 194,768 alerts were received, of which 30,728 (15.8%)
were validated as suspected cases. From these, 801 confirmed and 3 probable cases
were detected. EWARS showed an overall good performance: sensitivity and
specificity >80%, nearly all (97%) of alerts investigated within 2 hours of
notification, and good demographic representativeness. The average cost of the
system was US $438/case detected and US $1.8/alert received. The system was
stable, despite occasional disruptions caused by political insecurity. Our
results demonstrate that EWARS was a cost-effective component of the Ebola
surveillance strategy in this setting.
