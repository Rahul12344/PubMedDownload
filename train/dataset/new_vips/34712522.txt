Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) may cause various
neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations including optic perineuritis. Optic
perineuritis is a rare form of orbital inflammatory disease in which optic nerve 
sheath is inflamed and nonspecific fibrotic thickening with classic radiological 
finding is a perineural enhancement of optic nerve sheath. A 45-year-old
gentleman with known diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia was
admitted with a critically ill COVID-19 infection. During the recovery period,
the patient developed sudden onset of painless loss of vision. MRI head and orbit
with gadolinium was suggestive of optic perineuritis. Other secondary causes of
autoimmune or vasculitis myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
antibody disease and other common central nervous system (CNS) infection were
excluded. The patient had dramatic response with steroids. This is the first rare
case report of COVID-19-related optic perineuritis in critically ill COVID-19
patients with seronegative MOG antibody. Optic perineuritis is a rare orbital
inflammatory disease and underlying mechanisms may arise from systemic response
to COVID-19 infection as well as direct effects of the virus via
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors on ocular tissues. Optic
perineuritis is a rare disease with inflammation restricted to the optic nerve
sheath. Neuroimaging of the brain and orbit is the most important modality of
choice for visualizing optic nerve sheath and optic nerve. Delay in the diagnosis
of COVID-19-related optic perineuritis, may result in permanent optic nerve
injury and irreversible vision loss.
