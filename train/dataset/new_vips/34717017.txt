Largemouth Bass Virus (LMBV) first became a concern in Kansas when it was
identified as a potential cause of decreased catch rates at Crawford State
Fishing Lake in 2007. The discovery of LMBV in eight additional impoundments from
2008-2017 increased concern of the prevalence and effects of LMBV in Kansas. In
response, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism tested 25
Largemouth Bass impoundments for the presence of LMBV. The objectives of this
study were to quantify the incidence of LMBV and examine differences in
population metrics (i.e., body condition, relative abundance, and growth). A
total of 1,260 Largemouth Bass were collected using standard spring
electrofishing surveys, and sagittal otolith were collected from all sampled fish
to estimate growth rates. Of the 25 study impoundments, 14 tested positive for
LMBV. There was no evidence of LMBV effect on body condition, CPUq , or growth
rates. The initial date of LMBV infection of largemouth bass in these
impoundments are unknown. LMBV-positive populations in Kansas may have been
exposed to the virus many years ago and fish may be in the process of rebounding 
from any potential negative effects.
