Leprosy (Hansen's disease) can affect multiple organs and body structures. Skin
signs are typically observed in the early phase of the disease, hence being the
first identifiable signs to propel clinical suspicion. Leprosy predominantly
affects the skin and peripheral nerves. The disease has been documented many
centuries preceding the biblical era. Over many decades, the classification of
Hansen's disease has changed as modern medical science evolved. Patients with
leprosy are usually subjected to discrimination, rejection from society and can
suffer from social stigma, poor quality of life (QoL), low self-esteem and
permanent disfigurements. Studies have shown that leprosy has a significant
negative impact on the patients' QoL. Leprosy is often not suspected by
practicing clinicians because it is no longer emphasised in the medical
curricula. In modern years, attention has gradually shifted from leprosy to
tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
