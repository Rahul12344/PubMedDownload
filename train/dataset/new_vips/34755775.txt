OBJECTIVE: to analyze, in the scientific literature, the knowledge available on
the use of the prone position in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 or other 
health conditions.
METHOD: an integrative literature review developed through the following guiding 
question: What is the scientific knowledge available on the use of the prone
position in pregnant women with COVID-19 or other health conditions? The search
for studies was carried out in eight databases.
RESULTS: using the prone position in pregnant women with Acute Respiratory
Distress syndrome allowed for improvements in lung compliance and oxygenation. It
also allowed reducing uterine compression on the maternal large vessels, and a
reduction in blood pressure was observed in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia.
The prone position was also safe in the surgical management of pregnant patients.
In addition, the following conditions stood out as disadvantages related to the
prone position in pregnant women: possibility of aortocaval compression, causing 
severe hypotension, and inability to easily monitor fetal status or to perform
emergency Cesarean sections.
CONCLUSION: the prone position was considered safe, reliable and comfortable for 
its use in the clinical management of pregnant women, where specific care
measures must be taken to avoid compression of gravid abdomen, as well as fetal
monitoring is important to detect placental circulation impairment.
