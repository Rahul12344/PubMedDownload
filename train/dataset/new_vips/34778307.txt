SARS-CoV2 infection results in a range of symptoms from mild pneumonia to cardiac
arrhythmias, hyperactivation of the immune response, systemic organ failure and
death. However, the mechanism of action has been hard to establish. Analysis of
symptoms associated with COVID-19, the activity of repurposed drugs associated
with lower death rates or antiviral activity in vitro and a small number of
studies describing interventions, point to the importance of electrolyte, and
particularly potassium, homeostasis at both the cellular, and systemic level.
Elevated urinary loss of potassium is associated with disease severity, and the
response to electrolyte replenishment correlates with progression toward
recovery. These findings suggest possible diagnostic opportunities and
therapeutic interventions. They provide insights into comorbidities and
mechanisms associated with infection by SARS-CoV2 and other RNA viruses that
target the ACE2 receptor, and/or activate cytokine-mediated immune responses in a
potassium-dependent manner.
