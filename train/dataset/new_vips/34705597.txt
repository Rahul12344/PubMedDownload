Traditional treatment approaches for advanced malignancies have been associated
with limited clinical outcomes necessitating the development of novel therapies. 
However, the ability of radiotherapy to induce pro-immunogenic changes in tumor
immune microenvironment can be leveraged when combined with systemic agents.
Radio-immunotherapeutic initiatives employing the use of monoclonal antibodies,
genetically engineered T cells, cytokines and virus-vector mediated gene
therapies have demonstrated promising potential for the management of various
solid malignancies. Future studies incorporating biomarker enrichment strategies 
and radiobiological variables could pave the way for immune-oncology based
personalized medicine approaches to be integrated in standard of care practices
for the treatment of challenging clinical populations.
