Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a squamous carcinoma with apparent geographical
and racial distribution, mostly prevalent in East and Southeast Asia,
particularly concentrated in southern China. The epidemiological trend over the
past decades has suggested a substantial reduction in the incidence rate and
mortality rate due to NPC. These results may reflect changes in lifestyle and
environment, and more importantly, a deeper comprehension of the pathogenic
mechanism of NPC, leading to much progress in the preventing, screening, and
treating for this cancer. Herein, we present the recent advances on the key
signal pathways involved in pathogenesis of NPC, the mechanism of Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) entry into the cell, and the progress of EBV vaccine and screening
biomarkers. We will also discuss in depth the development of various therapeutic 
approaches including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy. These research advancements have led to a new era of precision
medicine in NPC.
