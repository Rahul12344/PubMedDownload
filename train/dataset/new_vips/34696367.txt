The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) pandemic is a great threat to human
society and now is still spreading. Although several vaccines have been
authorized for emergency use, only one recombinant subunit vaccine has been
permitted for widespread use. More subunit vaccines for COVID-19 should be
developed in the future. The receptor binding domain (RBD), located at the S
protein of SARS-CoV-2, contains most of the neutralizing epitopes. However, the
immunogenicity of RBD monomers is not strong enough. In this study, we fused the 
RBD-monomer with a modified Fc fragment of human IgG1 to form an RBD-Fc fusion
protein. The recombinant vaccine candidate based on the RBD-Fc protein could
induce high levels of IgG and neutralizing antibody in mice, and these could last
for at least three months. The secretion of IFN-Î³, IL-2 and IL-10 in the
RBD-stimulated splenocytes of immunized mice also increased significantly. Our
results first showed that the RBD-Fc vaccine could induce both humoral and
cellular immune responses and might be an optional strategy to control COVID-19.
