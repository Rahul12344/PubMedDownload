Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are one of the most common
cancers worldwide. A large number of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced
disease and require multimodal treatment approaches. Standard treatment
modalities ranging from surgery to chemotherapy and radiation are yielding mixed 
results. To overcome this hurdle, newer innovative approaches are required to
reduce the morbidity and mortality of the patients. In the last few decades,
immunotherapy has become an important part of treating some types of cancer. The 
immune system plays a key role in the development, establishment and progression 
of HNSCC. A greater understanding of the dysregulation and evasion of the immune 
system in the evolution and progression of HNSCC provides the basis for improved 
therapies and outcomes for patients. Newer types of immune treatments are now
being studied, and they will impact how we treat cancer in the future. This
article provides a brief overview of the current immunotherapeutic strategies for
cancer with emphasis on HNSCC.
