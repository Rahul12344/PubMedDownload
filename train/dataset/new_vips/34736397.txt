BACKGROUND: Amoebiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica,
which affects people living in low- and middle-income countries and has
intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. To date, knowledge on coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) coinfection with enteric parasites is limited, and E.
histolytica coinfection has not been previously described. Here we present the
case of a patient with COVID-19 who, during hospitalisation, presented a clinical
picture consistent with an amoebic liver abscess (ALA).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old man, admitted as a suspected case of COVID-19,
presented to our hospital with dyspnoea, malaise, fever and hypoxaemia. A
nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
After 7 days, he developed diarrhoea, choluria and dysentery. An abdominal
ultrasound showed a lesion compatible with a liver abscess; stool examination
revealed E. histolytica trophozoites, and additional serology for E. histolytica 
was positive. After 12 days of treatment with metronidazole, ceftazidime and
nitazoxanide, the patient reported acute abdominal pain, and an ultrasound
examination revealed free liquid in the abdominal cavity. An emergency
exploratory laparotomy was performed, finding 3000 mL of a thick fluid described 
as "anchovy paste". Computed tomography scan revealed a second abscess. He ended 
up receiving 21 days of antibiotic treatment and was discharged with satisfactory
improvement.
CONCLUSION: Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of
ALA and COVID-19 co-presenting. Based on their pathophysiological similarities,
coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and E. histolytica could change the patient's
clinical course; however, larger studies are needed to fully understand the
interaction between these pathogens.
