A flavonoid is a versatile core structure with various cellular, immunological,
and pharmacological effects. Recently, flavones have shown anti-dengue activities
by interfering with viral translation and replication. However, the molecular
target is still elusive. Here we chemically modified apigenin by adding an alkyne
moiety into the B-ring hydroxyl group. The alkyne serves as a chemical tag for
the alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction for subcellular visualization. The
compound located at the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after infection.
Interestingly, the compound signal started shifting to vesicle-like structures at
6 h and accumulated at 24 and 48 h after infection. Moreover, the compound
treatment in dengue-infected cells showed that the compound restricted the viral 
protein inside the vesicles, especially at 48 h. As a result, the dengue envelope
proteins spread throughout the cells. The alkyne-tagged apigenin showed a more
potent efficacy at the EC50 of 2.36 ± 0.22, and 10.55 ± 3.37 µM, respectively,
while the cytotoxicities were similar to the original apigenin at the CC50 of
70.34 ± 11.79, and 82.82 ± 11.68 µM, respectively. Molecular docking confirmed
the apigenin binding to the previously reported target, ribosomal protein S9, at 
two binding sites. The network analysis, homopharma, and molecular docking
revealed that the estrogen receptor 1 and viral NS1 were potential targets at the
late infection stage. The interactions could attenuate dengue productivity by
interfering with viral translation and suppressing the viral proteins from
trafficking to the cell surface.
