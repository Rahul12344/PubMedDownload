Pigeon aviadenovirus A and Pigeon circovirus are both DNA viruses, infect and
cause severe clinical diseases in pigeons. These viruses are associated with an
immunosuppression syndrome similar to 'Young Pigeon Disease Syndrome' (YPDS).
This study reports the identification of a natural co-infection, with severe
clinical signs (crop vomiting, watery diarrhoea, anorexia and sudden death) of
Pigeon aviadenovirus A and Pigeon circovirus in a breeding pigeon flock in
Central Anatolia, Turkey. Both viruses were isolated from pigeons pooled internal
organs using primary chicken embryo kidney cell cultures (CEKC) and specific
pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. Also, both viruses were identified 
by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing whereas histopathological
examination showed degenerated hepatocytes with basophilic intranuclear viral
inclusions. As known, both viruses typically have similar transmission
characteristics and common clinical manifestations; however, co-infection may
exacerbate the disease with devastating outcomes. This is the first report of its
kind in Turkey for those viruses and is essential for the protection against
these kinds of infections in pigeons.
