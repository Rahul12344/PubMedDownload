Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, is among the 
most medically significant mosquito-borne viruses, capable of causing major
epidemics of febrile disease and severe, chronic arthritis. Identifying viral
mutations is crucial for understanding virus evolution and evaluating those
genetic determinants that directly impact pathogenesis and transmissibility. The 
present study was undertaken to expand on past CHIKV evolutionary studies through
robust genome-scale phylogenetic analysis to better understand CHIKV genetic
diversity and evolutionary dynamics since its reintroduction into India in 2005. 
We sequenced the complete genomes of fifty clinical isolates collected between
2010 and 2016 from two geographic locations, Delhi and Mumbai. We then analysed
them along with 753 genomes available on the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis
Resource sampled over fifteen years (2005-20) from a range of locations across
the globe and identified novel genetic variants present in samples from this
study. Our analyses show evidence of frequent reintroduction of the virus into
India and that the most recent CHIKV outbreak shares a common ancestor as
recently as 2006.
