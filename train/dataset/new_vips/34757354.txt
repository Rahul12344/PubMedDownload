With over millions of years of evolution, viruses can infect cells efficiently by
utilizing their unique structures. Similarly, the drug delivery process is
designed to imitate the viral infection stages for maximizing the therapeutic
effect. From drug administration to therapeutic effect, nanocarriers must evade
the host's immune system, break through multiple barriers, enter the cell, and
release their payload by endosomal escape or nuclear targeting. Inspired by the
virus infection process, a number of virus-like nanosystems have been designed
and constructed for drug delivery. This review aims to present a comprehensive
summary of the current understanding of the drug delivery process inspired by the
viral infection stages. The most recent construction of virus-inspired
nanosystems (VINs) for drug delivery is sorted, emphasizing their novelty and
design principles, as well as highlighting the mechanism of these nanosystems for
overcoming each biological barrier during drug delivery. A perspective on the
VINs for therapeutic applications is provided in the end.
