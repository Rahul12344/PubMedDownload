COVID-19 is a pandemic requiring immediate solution for treatment because of its 
complex pathophysiology. Exploration of novel targets and thus treatment will be 
life savers which is the need of the hour. 2 host factors- TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are
responsible for the way the virus will enter and replicate in the host. Also NRF2
is an important protein responsible for its anti-inflammatory role by multiple
mechanisms of action like inhibition of NF-kB, suppression of pro-inflammatory
genes, etc. NRF2 is deacetylated by Sirtuins and therefore both have a direct
association. Absence of SIRT indicates inhibition of NRF2 expression and thus no 
anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory protection for the cell. Therefore, we
propose that NRF2 activators and/or SIRT activators can be evaluated to check
their efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of COVID-19.
