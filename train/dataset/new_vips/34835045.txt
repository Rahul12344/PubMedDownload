Survivors of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections frequently suffer from a range of
post-infection sequelae. Whether survivors of mild or asymptomatic infections can
expect any long-term health consequences is not yet known. Herein we investigated
lasting changes to soluble inflammatory factors and cellular immune phenotype and
function in individuals who had recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (n =
22), compared to those that had recovered from other mild respiratory infections 
(n = 11). Individuals who had experienced mild SARS-CoV-2 infections had elevated
levels of C-reactive protein 1-3 months after symptom onset, and changes in
phenotype and function of circulating T-cells that were not apparent in
individuals 6-9 months post-symptom onset. Markers of monocyte activation, and
expression of adherence and chemokine receptors indicative of altered migratory
capacity, were also higher at 1-3 months post-infection in individuals who had
mild SARS-CoV-2, but these were no longer elevated by 6-9 months post-infection. 
Perhaps most surprisingly, significantly more T-cells could be activated by
polyclonal stimulation in individuals who had recently experienced a mild
SARS-CoV-2, infection compared to individuals with other recent respiratory
infections. These data are indicative of prolonged immune activation and systemic
inflammation that persists for at least three months after mild or asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infections.
