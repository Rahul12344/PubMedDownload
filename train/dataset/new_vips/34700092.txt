PURPOSE: To examine the performance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19
from non-COVID-19 atypical pneumonia and to perform an analysis of CT patterns in
a study cohort including viral, fungal and atypical bacterial pathogens.
METHODS: Patients with positive RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 90) and 
non-COVID-19 atypical pneumonia (n = 294) were retrospectively included. Five
radiologists, blinded to the pathogen test results, assessed the CT scans and
classified them as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 pneumonia. For both groups specific
CT features were recorded and a multivariate logistic regression model was used
to calculate their ability to predict COVID-19 pneumonia.
RESULTS: The radiologists differentiated between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
pneumonia with an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 88% ± 4 (SD),
79% ± 6 (SD), and 90% ± 6 (SD), respectively. The percentage of correct ratings
was lower in the early and late stage of COVID-19 pneumonia compared to the
progressive and peak stage (68 and 71% vs 85 and 89%). The variables associated
with the most increased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia were band like subpleural
opacities (OR 5.55, p < 0.001), vascular enlargement (OR 2.63, p = 0.071), and
subpleural curvilinear lines (OR 2.52, p = 0.021). Bronchial wall thickening and 
centrilobular nodules were associated with decreased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia
with OR of 0.30 (p = 0.013) and 0.10 (p < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiologists can differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
atypical pneumonias at chest CT with high overall accuracy, although a lower
performance was observed in the early and late stage of COVID 19 pneumonia.
Specific CT features might help to make the correct diagnosis.
