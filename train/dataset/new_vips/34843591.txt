Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects target cells primarily
through cell-to-cell routes. Here, we provide evidence that cellular protein
M-Sec plays a critical role in this process. When purified and briefly cultured, 
CD4+ T cells of HTLV-1 carriers, but not of HTLV-1- individuals, expressed M-Sec.
The viral protein Tax was revealed to mediate M-Sec induction. Knockdown or
pharmacological inhibition of M-Sec reduced viral infection in multiple
co-culture conditions. Furthermore, M-Sec knockdown reduced the number of
proviral copies in the tissues of a mouse model of HTLV-1 infection.
Phenotypically, M-Sec knockdown or inhibition reduced not only plasma membrane
protrusions and migratory activity of cells, but also large clusters of Gag, a
viral structural protein required for the formation of viral particles. Taken
together, these results suggest that M-Sec induced by Tax mediates an efficient
cell-to-cell viral infection, which is likely due to enhanced membrane
protrusions, cell migration, and the clustering of Gag.
