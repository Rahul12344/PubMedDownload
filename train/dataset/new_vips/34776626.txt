COVID-19 has affected every individual physically or physiologically, leading to 
substantial impacts on how they perceive and respond to the pandemic's danger.
Due to the lack of vaccines or effective medicines to cure the infection, an
urgent control measure is required to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19.
This can be achieved using advanced computing, such as artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), cloud computing, and edge
computing. To control the exponential spread of the novel virus, it is crucial
for countries to contain and mitigate interventions. To prevent exponential
growth, several control measures have been applied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. As the pandemic has been spreading globally
for more than a year, an ample amount of data is available for researchers to
predict and forecast the effect of the pandemic in the near future. This article 
interprets the effects of COVID-19 using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR-F) while F-stands for 'Fatal with confirmation,' age-structured SEIR
(Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed) and machine learning for smart health
care and the well-being of citizens of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it examines
the different control measure scenarios produced by the modified SEIR model. The 
evolution of the simulation results shows that the interventions are vital to
flatten the virus spread curve, which can delay the peak and decrease the
fatality rate.
