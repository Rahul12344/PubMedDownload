BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, the safety of medical therapies for
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in relation to COVID-19 has emerged as an area
of concern. This study aimed to evaluate the association between IBD therapies
and severe COVID-19 outcomes.
METHOD: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published
studies from December 2019 to August 2021 to identify studies that reported
severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients on current IBD therapies including
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), immunomodulators, corticosteroids, biologics,
combination therapy, or tofacitinib.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified. Corticosteroids (risk ratio (RR)
1.91 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.91, p=0.003)) and 5-ASA (RR 1.50 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.93,
p=0.001)) were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in
patients with IBD patients. However, possible confounders for 5-ASA use were not 
controlled for. Sub-analysis showed that corticosteroids increased the risk of
intensive care unit (ICU) admission but not mortality. Immunomodulators alone (RR
1.18 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.59, p=0.28)) or in combination with anti-TNFs ((RR 0.96
(95% CI 0.80 to 1.15, p=0.63)), tofacitinib (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.33,
p=0.40)) and vedolizumab ((RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.31, p=0.89)) were not
associated with severe disease. Anti-TNFs (RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.54,
p<0.00001)) and ustekinumab (RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.72, p<0.00001)) were
associated with decreased risk of severe COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD, the risk of severe COVID-19 is higher among
patients receiving corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use was associated with ICU
admission but not mortality. The risk is also higher among patients receiving
5-ASAs. However, patient-level data were lacking and insufficient data existed
for meta-regression analyses to adjust for confounding. Vedolizumab, tofacitinib,
and immunomodulators alone or in combination with anti-TNF were not associated
with severe disease. Anti-TNFs, and ustekinumab were associated with favourable
outcomes.
