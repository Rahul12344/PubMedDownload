The data currently available on how the immune system recognises the SARS-CoV-2
virus is growing rapidly. While there are structures of some SARS-CoV-2 proteins 
in complex with antibodies, which helps us understand how the immune system is
able to recognise this new virus; however, we lack data on how T cells are able
to recognise this virus. T cells, especially the cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, are
critical for viral recognition and clearance. Here we report the X-ray
crystallography structure of a T cell receptor, shared among unrelated
individuals (public TCR) in complex with a dominant spike-derived CD8+ T cell
epitope (YLQ peptide). We show that YLQ activates a polyfunctional CD8+ T cell
response in COVID-19 recovered patients. We detail the molecular basis for the
shared TCR gene usage observed in HLA-A*02:01+ individuals, providing an
understanding of TCR recognition towards a SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Interestingly, the
YLQ peptide conformation did not change upon TCR binding, facilitating the
high-affinity interaction observed.
