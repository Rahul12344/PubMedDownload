Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that can inhibit apoptosis of
their host cell. As shown recently, this inhibition is in part explained by the
proteolytic degradation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (BH3-only
proteins) Bim, Puma, and Bad upon chlamydial infection. In this study, we further
explore this antiapoptotic mechanism. In cells infected with a Chlamydia
trachomatis L2 strain, Bim, Puma, and Bad were degraded with similar kinetics,
and the degradation of all three was blocked by inhibition of the proteasome.
Furthermore, the BH3-only proteins Bmf, Noxa, and tBid were also targeted by
chlamydial infection. The constitutively expressed Bmf disappeared during
infection. When Noxa was experimentally induced, the levels were also reduced by 
infection with C. trachomatis. In death-receptor-induced apoptosis, cleaved and
activated tBid was degraded, and this destruction was also prevented by
inhibition of the proteasome. These results show that chlamydial infection leads 
to a broad degradation of BH3-only proteins. This loss of proapoptotic factors
can explain the almost general protection of infected cells against apoptotic
stimuli.
