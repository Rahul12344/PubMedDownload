Apoptosis of murine and human macrophages induced by group B Streptococcus
agalactiae (GBS) is likely an important virulence mechanism that is used by the
bacteria to suppress the host immune response and to persist at sites of
infection. The mechanisms by which GBS induces apoptosis are, however, largely
unknown. In this study, we report that in murine macrophages GBS induces unique
changes in the regulation and localization of the apoptotic regulators Bad,
14-3-3, and Omi/high-temperature requirement A2 and leads to the release of
cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore,
inhibition of caspase-3 impaired GBS-induced apoptosis of macrophages. The
ability to modulate the activity of effector caspases may therefore represent an 
unexploited avenue for therapeutic intervention in GBS infections.
