BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(MTB) infection, is still a global public health problem. TB susceptibility
varies greatly in infected individuals, and mycobacterial recognition by the
innate immune system likely affects disease course and outcome. This research
describes a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 gene
that functionally alters the innate immune response to MTB and is associated with
TB susceptibility in India.
METHODS: 206 TB patients and 239 healthy controls from Hyderabad, India were
analyzed for SNPs in the TLR1 and TLR2 genes, which were subsequently correlated 
to TB susceptibility. To test individual responses to MTB lysates, we stimulated 
PBMCs from genotyped healthy German individuals, as well as HEK cells transfected
with TLR1/2 variants. TNF production and NF-kB activation were assessed
respectively.
RESULTS: Cohort analysis associated the TLR1-248N SNP (RS4833095) with TB
protection. TLR1-248N expressing PBMCs from healthy controls exhibited an
increased TNF response to MTB lysates. In addition to this, functional studies
using HEK cell lines transfected with TLR1-248N and stimulated with MTB showed an
increased NF-kB activation.
CONCLUSION: SNP TLR1-248N is associated with TB protection in an Indian
population and exhibits an increased immune response to MTB lysate in vitro.
