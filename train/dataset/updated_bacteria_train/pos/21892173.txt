Natural killer T cells (NKT cells) recognize glycolipid antigens presented by
CD1d. These cells express an evolutionarily conserved, invariant T cell antigen
receptor (TCR), but the forces that drive TCR conservation have remained
uncertain. Here we show that NKT cells recognized diacylglycerol-containing
glycolipids from Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of
community-acquired pneumonia, and group B Streptococcus, which causes neonatal
sepsis and meningitis. Furthermore, CD1d-dependent responses by NKT cells were
required for activation and host protection. The glycolipid response was
dependent on vaccenic acid, which is present in low concentrations in mammalian
cells. Our results show how microbial lipids position the sugar for recognition
by the invariant TCR and, most notably, extend the range of microbes recognized
by this conserved TCR to several clinically important bacteria.
