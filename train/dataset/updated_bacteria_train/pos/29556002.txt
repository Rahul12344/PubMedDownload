Live attenuated vaccines are generally highly efficacious and often superior to
inactivated vaccines, yet the underlying mechanisms of this remain largely
unclear. Here we identify recognition of microbial viability as a potent stimulus
for follicular helper T cell (TFH cell) differentiation and vaccine responses.
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) distinguished viable bacteria from dead bacteria 
through Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8)-dependent detection of bacterial RNA. In
contrast to dead bacteria and other TLR ligands, live bacteria, bacterial RNA and
synthetic TLR8 agonists induced a specific cytokine profile in human and porcine 
APCs, thereby promoting TFH cell differentiation. In domestic pigs, immunization 
with a live bacterial vaccine induced robust TFH cell and antibody responses, but
immunization with its heat-killed counterpart did not. Finally, a hypermorphic
TLR8 polymorphism was associated with protective immunity elicited by vaccination
with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in a human cohort. We have thus identified
TLR8 as an important driver of TFH cell differentiation and a promising target
for TFH cell-skewing vaccine adjuvants.
