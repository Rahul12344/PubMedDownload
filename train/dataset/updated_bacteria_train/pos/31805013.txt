Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MEK inhibitors (EGFRi/MEKi) are
beneficial for the treatment of solid cancers but are frequently associated with 
severe therapy-limiting acneiform skin toxicities. The underlying molecular
mechanisms are poorly understood. Using gene expression profiling we identified
IL-36γ and IL-8 as candidate drivers of EGFRi/MEKi skin toxicity. We provide
molecular and translational evidence that EGFRi/MEKi in concert with the skin
commensal bacterium Cutibacterium acnes act synergistically to induce IL-36γ in
keratinocytes and subsequently IL-8, leading to cutaneous neutrophilia. IL-36γ
expression was the combined result of C. acnes-induced NF-κB activation and
EGFRi/MEKi-mediated expression of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 
(KLF4), due to the presence of both NF-κB and KLF4 binding sites in the human
IL-36γ gene promoter. EGFRi/MEKi increased KLF4 expression by blockade of the
EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. These results provide an insight into understanding the
pathological mechanism of the acneiform skin toxicities induced by EGFRi/MEKi and
identify IL-36γ and the transcription factor KLF4 as potential therapeutic
targets.
