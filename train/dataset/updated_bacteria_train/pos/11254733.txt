The role of apoptosis in regulating the course of intracellular microbial
infection is not well understood. We studied the relationship between apoptotic
regulation and bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment in murine peritoneal
exudate macrophages (PEM) and the J774 macrophage cell line. In both PEM and J774
cells, mRNA expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, A1, was selectively induced by
BCG treatment as compared with other bcl2 family members (bcl-w, bcl-2, bcl-xl,
bcl-xs, bax, bak, bad). In PEM, A1 expression was maximal by 8 h postinfection
and was abrogated by the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. The induction was
independent of protein synthesis as well as the p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways and did not require live
organism. Three genes encoding closely related isoforms of A1 were all expressed;
however, the A1-a isoform displayed the greatest fold induction in PEM.
BCG-induced A1 expression was associated with protection of host macrophages from
NO-mediated apoptosis in both PEM and J774 cells. BCG-mediated protection was
abrogated in PEM derived from A1-a(-/-) mice, indicating a requirement of A1-a
for survival of inflammatory macrophages.
