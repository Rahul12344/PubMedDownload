The murine plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) signal sequence inefficiently
promotes the export of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (AP). High-level expression
of PAI2::AP chimeric proteins from the arabinose P(BAD) promoter is toxic and
confers an Ara(S) phenotype. Most Ara(R) suppressors map to secA, as determined
by sequencing 21 independent alleles. Mutations occur throughout the gene,
including both nucleotide binding domains (NBDI and NBDII) and the putative
signal sequence binding domain (SSBD). Using malE and phoA signal sequence
mutants, we showed that the vast majority of these secA suppressors exhibit weak 
Sec phenotypes. Eight of these secA mutations were further characterized in
detail. Phenotypically, these eight suppressors can be divided into three groups,
each localized to one domain of SecA. Most mutations allow near-normal levels of 
wild-type preprotein export, but they enhance the secretion defect conferred by
signal sequence mutations. Interestingly, one group exerts a selective effect on 
the export of PAI2::AP when compared to that of AP. In conclusion, this novel
class of secA mutations, selected as suppressors of a toxic signal sequence,
differs from the classical secA (prlD) mutations, selected as suppressors of
defective signal sequences, although both types of mutations affect signal
sequence recognition.
