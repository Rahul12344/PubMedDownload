OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the mechanisms and regulation pathways of BPIFB1
against P.aeruginosa infection.
METHODS: After treated with 10 ng/mL LPS and 1.28 mg/mL BPIFB1, RAW 246.7 cells
were detected for the expression levels of CD14 receptor, TLR4 and MyD88 by ELISA
and Western blotting. In addition, using RNAi and specific protease inhibitor
blockade respectively, we observed the changes in the expressions of MyD88,
TRAF6, NF-κB and different signaling pathway molecules in RAW 246.7 cells after
BPIFB1 and LPS treatment.
RESULTS: The expression levels of CD14, TLR4 and MyD88 significantly decreased
after the RAW264.7 cells were treated with BPIFB1 and LPS. When the expressions
of MyD88, TRAF6 and NF-κB were blocked by specific siRNA respectively, there was 
a significant reduction of TNF-α over-expression induced by BPIFB1 and LPS. And
when the cells were treated with BPIFB1, LPS and related protease inhibitors, the
phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, p38 and Akt1 were evidently inhibited by kinase
inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: The combination of BPIFB1 and LPS can reduce the degree of cell
inflammatory responses induced by P.aeruginosa by inhibiting the expressions of
relative intracellular cytokines.
