Resistance to arsenite (As(III)) by cells is generally accomplished by arsenite
efflux permeases from Acr3 or ArsB unrelated families. We analyzed the function
of three Acr3 proteins from Corynebacterium glutamicum, CgAcr3-1, CgAcr3-2, and
CgAcr3-3. CgAcr3-1 conferred the highest level of As(III) resistance and
accumulation in vivo. CgAcr3-1 was also the most active when everted membranes
vesicles from Escherichia coli or C. glutamicum mutants were assayed for efflux
with different energy sources. As(III) and antimonite (Sb(III)) resistance and
accumulation studies using E. coli or C. glutamicum arsenite permease mutants
clearly show that CgAcr3-1 is specific for As(III). In everted membrane vesicles 
expressing CgAcr3-1, dissipation of either the membrane potential or the pH
gradient of the proton motive force did not prevent As(III) uptake, whereas
dissipation of both components eliminated uptake. Further, a mutagenesis study of
CgAcr3-1 suggested that a conserved cysteine and glutamate are involved in active
transport. Therefore, we propose that CgAcr3-1 is an antiporter that catalyzes
arsenite-proton exchange with residues Cys129 and Glu305 involved in efflux.
