Humans with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a disease characterized by the
destruction of small bile ducts, exhibit signature autoantibodies against
mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex E2 (PDC-E2) that crossreact onto the
homologous enzyme of Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, an ubiquitous
alphaproteobacterium. Here, we show that infection of mice with N.
aromaticivorans induced signature antibodies against microbial PDC-E2 and its
mitochondrial counterpart but also triggered chronic T cell-mediated autoimmunity
against small bile ducts. Disease induction required NKT cells, which
specifically respond to N. aromaticivorans cell wall alpha-glycuronosylceramides 
presented by CD1d molecules. Combined with the natural liver tropism of NKT
cells, the accumulation of N. aromaticivorans in the liver likely explains the
liver specificity of destructive responses. Once established, liver disease could
be adoptively transferred by T cells independently of NKT cells and microbes,
illustrating the importance of early microbial activation of NKT cells in the
initiation of autonomous, organ-specific autoimmunity.
