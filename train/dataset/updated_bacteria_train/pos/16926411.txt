The gram-negative bacterium Bartonella henselae is capable of causing angiogenic 
lesions as a result of infection. Previously, it has been shown that B. henselae 
infection can result in production of the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). In this
study, we demonstrated that monocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes produce
IL-8 in response to B. henselae infection. We also investigated the role of IL-8 
in B. henselae-induced endothelial cell proliferation and capillary tube
formation. Both in vitro angiogenesis assays were IL-8 dependent. B.
henselae-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, as indicated by gene expression of Bax
and Bcl-2, was also shown to be IL-8 dependent in endothelial cells. Furthermore,
infection of endothelial cells with B. henselae stimulated upregulation of the
IL-8 chemokine receptor CXCR2. Infection of human endothelial cells by B.
henselae resulting in IL-8 production likely plays a central role in the ability 
of this organism to cause angiogenesis during infection.
