The 16S-rRNA gene of Bartonella bacilliformis was amplified using the
polymerase-chain reaction (PCR). The amplification product was sequenced using a 
linear-PCR procedure and compared with other published 16S-rRNA sequences. The
results of this analysis placed B. bacilliformis in the alpha subgroup of the
proteobacteria, and more specifically demonstrated its close phylogenetic
relationship to Rochalimaea quintana. This relationship is supported by
similarities in the size and mean base composition of the genomes of the two
species, and by shared phenotypic characteristics.
