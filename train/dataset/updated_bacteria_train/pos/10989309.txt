Glycolipid-specific, CD1a-, b- and c-dependent cytotoxic T cells have recently
been shown to be involved in the host response against tuberculosis. These CD1
molecules 'sample' mycobacterial glycolipids from different intracellular sites
in the infected cell. Additionally, upon microbial encounter, CD1d-dependent
natural killer T cells promptly produce cytokines and perform regulatory
activities. Here, we discuss the intracellular localization of CD1 molecules and 
mycobacterial lipids and the role of CD1-mediated T-cell responses in
mycobacterial infections.
