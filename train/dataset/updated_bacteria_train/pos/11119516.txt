Pseudomonas aeruginosa plays a major role in respiratory tract infections or
sepsis in patients with cystic fibrosis or upon suppression of the immune system.
Several P. aeruginosa strains have been shown to be internalized by human
epithelial cells; however, the molecular mechanisms of the invasion process are
poorly characterized. Here, we show that the internalization of P. aeruginosa
into human epithelial cells results in and requires activation of the Src-like
tyrosine kinases p59Fyn and p60Src and the consequent tyrosine phosphorylation of
several eukaryotic proteins. The significance of Src-like tyrosine kinase
activation is shown by an almost complete blockade of P. aeruginosa
internalization, but not adhesion, upon inhibition of Src-like tyrosine kinases. 
Likewise, inhibition of P. aeruginosa binding to CFTR, which has been shown to
block P. aeruginosa internalization, prevents Src and Fyn activation, supporting 
a pivotal role of Src-like tyrosine kinases for invasion by P. aeruginosa.
