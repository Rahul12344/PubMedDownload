The proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients
with guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis to streptococcal M protein were
investigated using whole and trypsinized group A M22-positive streptococci.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to whole type M22 group A
streptococci were significantly increased in guttate, but not chronic plaque,
psoriasis patients compared to 17 non-psoriatic controls (p < 0.05; n = 17). A
significant reduction of this response was observed in both guttate (p < 0.001; n
= 17) and chronic plaque (p < 0.01; n = 27) psoriatic patients, but not in the
control group, after repeated trypsinization to remove M protein from the
streptococci. Furthermore, the difference between the peripheral blood
mononuclear cell response to untrypsinized and trypsinized streptococci was
significantly greater in the guttate patients than in the controls (p < 0.02).
This preliminary study has shown an increased reactivity of T lymphocytes with
specificity for trypsin-sensitive protein expressed by type M22 streptococci in
the peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis.
