Helicobacter pylori is an etiological agent of gastritis, peptic ulcer, and
gastric cancer. Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is an antimicrobial peptide which
belongs to one of the most important host defense systems against bacterial
infection in several epithelial tissues. We studied the effect of H. pylori on
the expression of hBD-2 mRNA in MKN45 gastric mucosal cells. H. pylori, but not
culture filtrate, increased the hBD-2 mRNA level in MKN45 cells; the inductive
effect of H. pylori was not detected with Intestine 407 cells. Among H. pylori
strains, strain OHPC0002, which lacks a cag Pathogenicity Island (PAI), did not
induce hBD-2 mRNA in MKN45 cells. These results suggested that H. pylori cag PAI 
is critical for the induction of hBD-2 mRNA in MKN45 cells. Exposure of MKN45
cells to Salmonella typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. typhi, and S. dublin, but not
Escherichia coli ML35, also resulted in induction of hBD-2 mRNA.
