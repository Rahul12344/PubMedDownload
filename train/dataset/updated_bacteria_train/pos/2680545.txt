A point source outbreak of haemorrhagic colitis due to Escherichia coli O 157.H7 
producing verocytotoxin (VT), took place following a christening party in
Birmingham in June 1987. Twenty-six people were affected, six were admitted to
hospital and one developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome: there were no deaths. VT 
+ E. coli O 157.H7 was isolated from 13 (57%) of 23 faecal specimens from
affected people and from 3 (9%) of 33 specimens from asymptomatic people. Free VT
was detected in the faeces of one further asymptomatic person. Illness was
associated with eating turkey-roll sandwiches (P less than 0.001) suggesting that
cold meats might be an important source of infection.
