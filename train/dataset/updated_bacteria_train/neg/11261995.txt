The use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and multivariate
pattern recognition techniques for the rapid detection and identification of
bacterial contamination in liquids was evaluated. The complex biochemical
composition of bacteria yields FT-NIR vibrational transitions (overtone and
combination bands) that can be used for classification and identification.
Bacterial suspensions (Escherichia coli HB101, E. coli ATCC 43888, E. coli 1224, 
Bacillus amyloliquifaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria
innocua) were filtered to harvest the cells and eliminate the matrix, which has a
strong NIR signal. FT-NIR measurements were done using a diffuse
reflection-integrating sphere. Principal component analysis showed tight
clustering of the bacterial strains at the information-rich spectral region of
6000-4000 cm(-1). The method reproducibly distinguished between different E. coli
isolates and conclusively identified the relationship between a new isolate and
one of the test species. This methodology may allow for the rapid assessment of
potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample preparation.
