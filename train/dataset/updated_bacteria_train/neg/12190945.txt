Chronic plaque psoriasis is a T cell mediated disease associated with group A
streptococci (GAS). We have previously shown the presence of a psoriasis-specific
dermal Th1 subset that recognizes GAS antigens. To assess whether GAS-reactive T 
cells are also present in lesional epidermis, fresh cell suspensions or T cell
lines isolated from lesional epidermis of 33 psoriasis patients were stained for 
intracellular interferon-gamma after stimulation with GAS antigens. The patients 
were typed by PCR for HLA-DR7 and HLA-Cw6 expression. A subset of GAS-reactive
CD8+ T cells (2.4% +/- 2.4) was found in 14/21 (67%) fresh cell suspensions. A
smaller subset of GAS-reactive CD4+ T cells (0.9% +/- 0.9) was found in 13/21
(62%) fresh cell suspensions, which was expanded in the T cell lines. There was a
significant inverse correlation between the proportions of GAS-reactive CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells in the fresh suspensions (r = -0.48, P = 0.0277). The presence of
GAS-reactive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells did not correlate with HLA-DR7 or HLA-Cw6
expression, respectively. This study has demonstrated GAS-reactive CD8+, and to a
lesser extent CD4+, T cell subsets in psoriatic epidermis and provides further
evidence that GAS antigens may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque 
psoriasis.
