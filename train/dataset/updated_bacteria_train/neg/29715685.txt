Streptococcus pneumoniae is characterised into 92 serotypes based on antigenic
reactions of commercial rabbit sera to the capsular polysaccharides. During
development of a bioinformatic serotyping tool (PneumoCaT), an isolate exhibited 
a novel codon at residue 385 of the glycosyltransferase gene wcwK encoding a
distinct amino acid, which differentiates genogroup 7. Investigation by repeat
serotyping and Quellung reaction revealed a novel pattern of factor sera with the
isolate reacting very strongly with 7f, but also with 7e factor sera. The
structure of the capsular polysaccharide was determined by NMR spectroscopy to be
an approximately 5:1 combination of the structures of 7C and 7B, respectively,
and the structure of 7C was also elucidated. All data from whole genome
sequencing, NMR spectroscopy, production of antisera and serotyping of the novel 
7 strain shows that it is a new serotype, which will be named in the Danish
nomenclature as 7D.
