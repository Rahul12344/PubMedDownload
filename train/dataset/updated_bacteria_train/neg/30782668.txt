Gut microbiota and their metabolites are instrumental in regulating homeostasis
at intestinal and extraintestinal sites. However, the complex effects of prenatal
and early postnatal microbial exposure on adult health and disease outcomes
remain incompletely understood. Here, we showed that mice raised under germ-free 
conditions until weaning and then transferred to specific pathogen-free (SPF)
conditions harbored altered microbiota composition, augmented inflammatory
cytokine and chemokine expression, and were hyper-susceptible to
colitis-associated tumorigenesis later in adulthood. Increased number and size of
colon tumors and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in recolonized
germ-free mice were associated with augmented intratumoral CXCL1, CXCL2, and
CXCL5 expression and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (G-MDSC)
accumulation. Consistent with these findings, CXCR2 neutralization in recolonized
germ-free mice completely reversed the exacerbated susceptibility to
colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings highlight a crucial 
role for early-life microbial exposure in establishing intestinal homeostasis
that restrains colon cancer in adulthood.
