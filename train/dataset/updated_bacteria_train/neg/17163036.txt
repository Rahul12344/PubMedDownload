In recent years manure-based biogas plants (MBBP) have won more and more
importance, because of the numerous ecological advantages. The processes are
similar to processes, which have been well known for many decades in anaerobic
wastewater/sludge treatment. As a result of technical progress and permanently
rising prices for non-renewable energy, MBBPs have become more and more
economically reasonable. Because of the economies of scale law more and more
larger MBBPs are being built (250-2000 kW(el)). With regard to investment costs, 
reactor volumes and complexity etc., these (centralized) plants are comparable
with small wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Consequently, as actually in the
case of the small WWTPs a rising use of instrumentation, control and automation
(ICA) for larger MBBPs can be observed.
