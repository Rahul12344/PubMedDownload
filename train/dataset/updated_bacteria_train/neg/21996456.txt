The invariant NKT cells are involved in both immunity and immune tolerance.
However, their roles in transplant models remain controversial. We studied the
role of NKT cells in the allograft response using two different strains of NKT
deficient mice (CD1d-/- and Jα18-/- mice), and found that CD1d-/- and Jα18-/-
mice rejected islet allografts with a similar kinetics as wild type B6 mice.
Treatment of CD1d-/- and Jα18-/- mice with donor specific transfusion and
anti-CD154 induced donor specific tolerance, which was identical to similarly
treated wt B6 mice. The islet allograft tolerance requires Foxp3(+) Tregs. In the
periphery, Foxp3(+) Tregs in CD1d-/-, Jα18-/-, and wt B6 mice were comparable
both phenotypically and functionally. In addition, CD1d-/- and Jα18-/- CD4(+) T
cells (non-Tregs) could be readily converted to Foxp3(+) Tregs by TGF-β in vitro.
Our data suggest that islet allograft tolerance can be successfully established
without invariant NKT cells.
