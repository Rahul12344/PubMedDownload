Potential beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria on the genital health of
cows become of particular interest when considering the importance of an optimal 
uterine health status for the success of breeding in dairy farming. Therefore,
the aim of the present study was to analyse the influence of an intrauterine
administration of the Lactobacillus buchneri DSM 32407 on reproductive
performance, uterine health status, endometrial mRNA expression of
pro-inflammatory factors of cows with signs of subclinical endometritis (SCE). L.
buchneri DSM 32407 (n = 56; [LAC]) or a placebo (n = 60; [PLA]) was administered 
on day 24-30 postpartum. Endometrial cytobrush samples of cows with SCE were
taken before the administration and at three following weeks (n = 16 cows each
for LAC/SCE and PLA/SCE). A higher proportion of cows of the LAC and LAC/SCE
group was pregnant after the first service and median days to conception for cows
pregnant on day 200 pp were shorter. Three weeks after the administration, the
endometrial mRNA expression of CXCL1/2, CXCL3, CXCR2, IL1B, IL8 and PTPRC was
lower in the LAC/SCE group compared with the PLA/SCE group. These findings
suggest that the presence of L. buchneri DSM 32407 contributes to a uterine
environment that results in a better reproductive performance.
