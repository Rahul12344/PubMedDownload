Emphysematous pyelonephritis is an acute necrotizing infection with gas in the
kidney and perinephric space that carries a bad prognosis. Apart from its
predisposing clinical entities, diabetes mellitus and immune-incompetence are
quite common in patients with this infection. We report a case of a 53-year-old
kidney transplant recipient diabetic male, suffering from recurrent fever,
abdominal pain and nausea episodes. Immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics were
administered and percutaneous drainage was performed after the diagnosis. The
bacteria involved were Stahpylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. After 4
weeks of antibiotic treatment and abscesses drainage, the case was resolved.
Consecutives urine cultures and ultrasonographies confirm the complete resolution
of the disease. We discuss the predisposing factors, clinical presentation and
management.
