Across clinical trials, T cell expansion and persistence following adoptive cell 
transfer (ACT) have correlated with superior patient outcomes. Herein, we
undertook a pan-cancer analysis to identify actionable ligand-receptor pairs
capable of compromising T cell durability following ACT. We discovered that
FASLG, the gene encoding the apoptosis-inducing ligand FasL, is overexpressed
within the majority of human tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Further, we
uncovered that Fas, the receptor for FasL, is highly expressed on patient-derived
T cells used for clinical ACT. We hypothesized that a cognate Fas-FasL
interaction within the TME might limit both T cell persistence and antitumor
efficacy. We discovered that genetic engineering of Fas variants impaired in the 
ability to bind FADD functioned as dominant negative receptors (DNRs), preventing
FasL-induced apoptosis in Fas-competent T cells. T cells coengineered with a Fas 
DNR and either a T cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor exhibited enhanced 
persistence following ACT, resulting in superior antitumor efficacy against
established solid and hematologic cancers. Despite increased longevity, Fas
DNR-engineered T cells did not undergo aberrant expansion or mediate
autoimmunity. Thus, T cell-intrinsic disruption of Fas signaling through genetic 
engineering represents a potentially universal strategy to enhance ACT efficacy
across a broad range of human malignancies.
