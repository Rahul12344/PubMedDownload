Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) is a rare disease caused by mutations in
the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase 
(GALNS). We report here two GALNS pharmacological chaperones, ezetimibe and
pranlukast, identified by molecular docking-based virtual screening. These
compounds bound to the active cavity of GALNS and increased its thermal stability
as well as the production of recombinant GALNS in bacteria, yeast, and HEK293
cells. MPS IVA fibroblasts treated with these chaperones exhibited increases in
GALNS protein and enzyme activity and reduced the size of enlarged lysosomes.
Abnormalities in autophagy markers p62 and LC3B-II were alleviated by ezetimibe
and pranlukast. Combined treatment of recombinant GALNS with ezetimibe or
pranlukast produced an additive effect. Altogether, the results demonstrate that 
ezetimibe and pranlukast can increase the yield of recombinant GALNS and be used 
as a monotherapy or combination therapy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of
MPS IVA enzyme replacement therapy.
