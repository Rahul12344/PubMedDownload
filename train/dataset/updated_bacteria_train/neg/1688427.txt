R-factor mediated bacterial resistance to arsenical salts occurs by active
extrusion of the toxic oxyanions from cells of gram negative bacteria. The ars
operon of the conjugative plasmid R773 encodes an anion pump. The pump has two
polypeptide components. The catalytic subunit, the ArsA protein, is an
oxyanion-stimulated ATPase. The membrane component, the ArsB protein, has been
localized in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. The ArsA and ArsB proteins
have been postulated to form a membrane complex which functions as an
anion-translocating ATPase. In this study evidence is presented showing that
expression of the arsB gene is required to anchor the ArsA protein to the inner
membrane. Binding studies with purified ArsA to membranes with and without the
arsB gene product confirm this requirement. Membranes of uncA mutants containing 
both the ArsA and ArsB proteins exhibit arsenite(antimonite)-stimulated ATPase
activity. These results support the model in which the ArsA protein is the
catalytic energy transducing component of the anion pump, whereas the integral
membrane ArsB protein serves as both the anion channel and membrane binding site 
for the ArsA protein.
