Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are a highly heterogeneous population of lymphocytes
that exhibit innate and adaptive immune properties. Despite comprising the
majority of residing lymphocytes in many organs, the role of γδ T cells in
transplantation outcomes is under-researched. γδ T cells can recognise a diverse 
array of ligands and exert disparate effector functions. As such, they may
potentially contribute to both allograft acceptance and rejection, as well as
impacting on infection and post-transplant malignancy. Here, we review the
current literature on the role and function of γδ T cells following solid organ
and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
