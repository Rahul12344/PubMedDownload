Halitosis is a very common condition which may affect up to 30% of the
population. In about 90% of the cases, halitosis originates in the mouth due to
inadequate plaque control, periodontal disease, dry mouth, faulty restorations,
and in particular due to excessive bacterial growth. Oral malodor is mainly
caused by a microbial degradation of amino acids into volatile, bad-smelling
gases (volatile sulfur compounds - VSCs). Management of oral malodor is directed 
primarily at managing and reducing the VSC-producing bacteria count as well as
masking the odor. Essential oils have been used for this purpose in traditional
medicine for centuries. In the present review, data on the antimicrobial activity
of essential oils against relevant oral VSC-producing bacteria are compiled and
compared. Additionally, other positive aspects of essential oils with regard to
oral odor are considered.
