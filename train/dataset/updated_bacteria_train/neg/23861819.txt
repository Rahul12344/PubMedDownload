NLRPs (Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing
proteins) are a family of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense
intracellular microbial components and endogenous stress signals. NLRP10 (also
known as PYNOD) is a unique NLRP member characterized by a lack of the putative
ligand-binding leucine-rich repeat domain. Recently, human NLRP10 has been shown 
to inhibit the self-association of ASC into aggregates and ASC-mediated
procaspase-1 processing. However, such activities are not found in mouse NLRP10. 
Here we report the solution structure and dynamics of human NLRP10 pyrin domain
(PYD), whose helix H3 and loop H2-H3 adopt a conformation distinct from those of 
mouse NLRP10. Docking studies show that human and mouse NLRP10 PYDs may interact 
differently with ASC PYD. These results provide a possible structural explanation
for the contrasting effect of NLRP10 on ASC aggregation in human cells versus
mouse models. Finally, we also provide evidence that in human NLRP10 the PYD
domain may not interact with the NOD domain to regulate its intrinsic nucleotide 
hydrolysis activity.
