Vibrio vulnificus infection often occurs in warm regions, frequently leading to
necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis, and death. We herein report a rare case presenting
in a cold climate region in northern Japan, Aomori district, of a V. vulnificus
infection complicated by necrotizing fasciitis and septic shock. The patient's
prior history of injury and typical clinical course were helpful clues to the
diagnosis of V. vulnificus infection, and early initiation of antimicrobial
treatment saved his life. V. vulnificus infection should be considered even in
cold regions, particularly if patients have risk factors.
