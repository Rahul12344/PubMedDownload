A 3-year-old sexually intact male Bull Mastiff underwent splenectomy for splenic 
thrombosis; prior to and after splenectomy, multiple blood transfusions were
administered. Two weeks after the procedure, T-cell lymphoproliferative disease
was diagnosed. Treatment with prednisone and chlorambucil was initiated, and 2
weeks later, cytologic examination of a blood smear revealed small (0.3 microm), 
coccoid basophilic bodies on the surface of approximately 70% of the RBCs.
Morphologically, these resembled "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum." A
polymerase chain reaction assay was used to amplify a partial 16S rRNA sequence
in blood obtained from the dog; the product was sequenced and compared with 16S
rRNA gene sequences of other hemotropic mycoplasmas. The sequence was 98%
homologous to that of "Candidatus M haemominutum", but only 77% homologous to
that of M haemocanis and M haemofelis.
