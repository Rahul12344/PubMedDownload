Cellular immune responses are directed against a narrow set of immunodominant
peptides derived from complex antigens. By contrast, epitopes that are hidden or 
infrequent targets of immune responses have been termed cryptic or subdominant.
Although the identification of immunodominant epitopes is important for vaccine
development, understanding immunological reactivity to cryptic or subdominant
epitopes may hold clues to autoimmunity. We have examined the role of
antigen-presenting (APC) cells in the selection of class Ii-restricted epitopes
for display to T lymphocytes. The formation and MHC-restricted presentation of
distinct antigenic epitopes is directly dependent upon processing and ligand
binding reactions within APC. A novel MHC heterodimer, HLA-DM, facilitates the
binding and presentation of peptides by class II DR, DP, and DQ molecules. We
have demonstrated that some epitopes derived from endogenous antigens bind class 
II proteins independent of DM, whereas the presentation of other endogenous
peptides is greatly influenced by DM expression. Targeting of exogenous antigens 
into specialized processing compartments within APC appears to overcome the
requirement for DM in antigen presentation. These studies suggest HLA-DM may play
a role in epitope selection and immunodominance.
