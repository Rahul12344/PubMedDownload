Fournier's gangrene is a rare condition, far from being 'idiopathic', which must 
be taken seriously and which is, although at first manifesting itself only
locally, a generalized condition with high mortality and--unless
recognized--taking a rapid course with lethal outcome. Many risk factors have
been recognized which favor an often lethal outcome. Although oftentimes not
recognized, a port of entry is always present and haemolytic streptococci are as 
a rule involved. Since Fournier the age limit has moved to the 5th and 6th
decades. Early recognition, prompt and aggressive surgical treatment and
antibiotic coverage are mandatory to offer patients a chance to survive.
