OBJECTIVE: Melatonin is known to influence immune functions and to ameliorate
outcome after septic challenge but it is unknown whether this is mediated by
melatonin receptor activation. This study aimed to elucidate molecular
differences in spleen and ex vivo splenocytes of wild-type (WT) and melatonin
receptor double knockout mice (KO) after polymicrobial sepsis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: C3H/HeN wild-type and MT1-/-/MT2-/- mice underwent sham
operation or cecum ligation and incision (CLI) and remained anesthetized for 1 h.
Splenocytes were isolated and treated in culture with physiological melatonin
concentrations (1 nM).
RESULTS: Plasma TNFα levels were consistently high after 1 h of CLI. Basal
circulating leukocyte numbers were slightly higher in KO animals. We detected
transcriptional differences in splenocytes of the knockout strain concerning
proinflammatory mediators. Expression levels of IL-1β, IL-2, CXCR2, L-Selectin,
TNFα, CXCL2 and ICAM-1 were strongly increased in splenocytes of KO mice.
Splenocytes of KO mice displayed reduced ERK and p38 as well as increased JNK
phosphorylation. None of the analyzed factors were influenced by melatonin in the
culture medium.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate an increased proinflammatory
status of mice deficient in both membrane-bound melatonin receptors reflected by 
altered activation of MAPK cascades and transcriptional activation of
proinflammatory mediators.
