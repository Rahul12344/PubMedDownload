Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause
of cancer-related mortality in the world. Late diagnosis and classical
therapeutic approaches such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy make this
disease a still threatening tumor. Genetic asset, environmental stress, dietary
habit and infections caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are the major
causes concurring to GC initiation. A common mechanism is induction of radicals
resulting in gastric mucosal injury. A regular food intake of antioxidant and
radical scavenging agents has been proposed to exert protection against
tumorigenesis. Resveratrol belongs to the polyphenol flavonoids class of
antioxidants produced by a restricted number of plants. Resveratrol exerts
bactericidal activity against H. pylori and is a powerful antioxidant, thus
acting as a tumor preventive agent. Resveratrol intracellular signaling results
in growth arrest and apoptosis, so that it can be directed against tumor
progression. Resveratrol therapeutic potential against GC initiation and
progression are reviewed here.
