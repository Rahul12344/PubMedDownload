Baseline and impact assessment data were generated in 1994 (n = 532) and 2011 (n 
= 593) from 6 sentinel villages with generalized onchocerciasis. Only volunteers 
and a cohort (n = 445, 75%) were screened at both visits. Each village had
received 11 (64.7%) annual treatments and 92.6%, range 88.7-100%, treatment
compliance. Overall mean number of treatment was 2.9 ± 1.6 with a range 2.0 ±
1.2-3.3 ± 0.6. Significant decreases in skin microfilaria prevalence from 201
(38%) to 0 (0%), palpable nodule from 77 (15%) to 4 (0.7%), dermal changes from
51 (9.6%) to 2 (0.04%), optic nerve disease from 24 (4.5%) to 4 (2.0%), and
onchocercal inducible ocular lesions from 31 (5.8%) to 12 (2.0%) were recorded, P
< 0.05, (t-test of unpaired data). Cases of glaucoma, 8 (1.4%), and blindness, 6 
(1.05%), remained unchanged. Visual acuity ≥6/24 in one or both eyes, 198
(33.45%); cataract, 169 (28.5%); pterygium 157 (26.5%); and acute senilis, 165
(27.9%), were significantly increased and positively correlated with increase in 
age (R (2) = 0.898 - 0.949). Dissected parous Simulium damnosum caught (n = 222) 
were without infective third stage larva. Active onchocerciasis transmission
seems halted despite varied compliance to long-term ivermectin treatment. We
recommend continued surveillance and targeted treatment of controlled and
hypoendemic areas.
