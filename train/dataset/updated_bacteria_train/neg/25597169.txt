OBJECTIVE: To construct, express and purify human fusion proteins composed of a
single-chain antibody fragment scFv that recognizes the prostate specific
membrane antigen (PSMA) protein, Fdt, HA2 and tp, and to analyze the binding
activity of the expressed fusion proteins.
METHODS: The fusion protein genes scFv, scFv-tp, and scFv-Fdt-HA2-tp were
amplified by PCR, and the genes obtained were then cloned into the expression
vector pET28 and expressed in E. coli BL21. The expressed products were
identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot and purified with Ni(2+)-NTA chelating
agarose. The antigen-binding activity of the fusion proteins was determined by
ELISA.
RESULTS: The human anti-PSMA fusion gene was successfully constructed and
expressed in M15 as the inclusion body after induced with IPTG. All the target
proteins expressed could bind the PSMA antigen.
CONCLUSION: Fusion proteins can specifically bind the PSMA antigen. This finding 
contributes to the study of the targeted delivery of siRNA.
