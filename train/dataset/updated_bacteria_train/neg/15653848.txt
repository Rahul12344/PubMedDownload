A novel small haemoplasma was detected following cytological examination of blood
smears from a splenectomized dog with haemic neoplasia. The 16S rRNA and rnpB
genes of the organism were partially sequenced and a phylogenetic tree
constructed. The organism was most closely related to the small feline
haemoplasma, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (94 % 16S rRNA gene nucleotide 
sequence identity; 75 % rnpB) and was only distantly related to Mycoplasma
haemocanis (78 % 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence identity; 65 % rnpB). As this 
organism has not been cultured in vitro, the candidate species name 'Candidatus
Mycoplasma haematoparvum' is proposed.
