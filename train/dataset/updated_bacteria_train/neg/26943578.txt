Understanding mast cell development is essential due to their critical role in
regulating immunity and autoimmune diseases. Here, we show how Rho kinases (ROCK)
regulate mast cell development and can function as therapeutic targets for
treating allergic diseases. Rock1 deficiency results in delayed maturation of
bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) in response to IL-3 stimulation and
reduced growth in response to stem cell factor (SCF) stimulation. Further,
integrin-mediated adhesion and migration, and IgE-mediated degranulation are all 
impaired in Rock1-deficient BMMCs. To understand the mechanism behind altered
mast cell development in Rock1-/- BMMCs, we analyzed the activation of ROCK and
its downstream targets including LIM kinase (LIMK). We observed reduced
activation of ROCK, LIMK, AKT and ERK1/2 in Rock1-deficient BMMCs in response to 
SCF stimulation. Further, loss of either Limk1 or Limk2 also demonstrated altered
BMMC maturation and growth; combined deletion of both Limk1 and Limk2 resulted in
further reduction in BMMC maturation and growth. In passive cutaneous anaphylaxis
model, deficiency of Rock1 or treatment with ROCK inhibitor Fasudil protected
mice against IgE-mediated challenge. Our results identify ROCK/LIMK pathway as a 
novel therapeutic target for treating allergic diseases involving mast cells.
