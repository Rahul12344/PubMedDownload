Temperature dependence of the resonance Raman spectra of plastocyanin and azurin 
between cryogenic and ambient conditions.

Woodruff WH, Norton KA, Swanson BI, Fry HA.

Resonance Raman spectra of spinach plastocyanin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin
were studied as a function of temperature between 10 K and 300 K. The spectra are
markedly improved both in signal/noise ratio and in resolution at low
temperatures. The assignments of the resonance Raman-active vibrations are
reinterpreted in view of the number and intensities of peaks observed in the
low-temperature spectra. Features appear in the low-temperature spectra of azurin
that may be due to copper-bound methionine. The plastocyanin spectra undergo a
transition between 220 K and the melting point of water that results in
dramatically narrowed peaks at lower temperature and a shift in the carbon-sulfur
stretching frequency of the copper-bound cysteine, suggesting a structural change
in the active site and an accompanying effect on vibrational dephasing.
Considering that the structures and nonvibrational spectroscopies of these two
proteins are similar, the substantial differences in the resonance Raman spectra 
are striking and significant.
