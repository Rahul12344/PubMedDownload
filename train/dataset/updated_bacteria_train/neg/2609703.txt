A case report is given on a Borrelia burgdorferi infection regarded to be typical
because of its clinical course and the diagnosis lately made. The
meningopolyneuritis was treated by use of corticosteroids before the serologic
detection of Lyme disease. 21 months after infection our patient died of a colon 
carcinoma. Histological preparation of the brain showed a slight encephalitis we 
consider as third-stage Lyme borreliosis. We conclude that antibacterial therapy 
is necessary in the management of Lyme disease, especially after the
administration of corticosteroids.
