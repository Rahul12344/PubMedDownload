Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of dietary spice turmeric (Curcuma
longa), has been shown in recent studies to have therapeutic potential in the
treatment of cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. We investigated the
ability of curcumin to modulate the growth of B lymphomas. Curcumin inhibited the
growth of both murine and human B lymphoma in vitro and murine B lymphoma in
vivo. We also demonstrate that curcumin-mediated growth inhibition of B lymphoma 
is through inhibition of the survival kinase Akt and its key target Bad. However,
in vitro kinase assays show that Akt is not a direct target of curcumin. We
identified a novel target for curcumin in B lymphoma viz spleen tyrosine kinase
(Syk). Syk is constitutively activated in primary tumors and B lymphoma cell
lines and curcumin down-modulates Syk activity accompanied by down-regulation of 
Akt activation. Moreover, we show that overexpression of Akt, a target of Syk, or
Bcl-x(L), a target of Akt can overcome curcumin-induced apoptosis of B lymphoma
cells. These observations suggest a novel growth promoting role for Syk in
lymphoma cells.
