Natural killer T (NKT) lymphocytes are implicated in the early response to
microbial infection. Further, sulfatide, a myelin self-glycosphingolipid,
activates a type II NKT cell subset and can modulate disease in murine models. We
examined the role of NKT cells and the effect of sulfatide treatment in a murine 
model of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis. The lack of CD1d-restricted NKT cells did 
not alter survival after a lethal inoculum of S. aureus. In contrast, sulfatide
treatment significantly improved the survival rate of mice with S. aureus sepsis,
accompanied by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 
in the blood. The protective effect of sulfatide treatment depended on CD1d but
not on type I NKT cells, suggesting that activation of type II NKT cells by
sulfatide has beneficial effects on the outcome of S. aureus sepsis in this
model.
