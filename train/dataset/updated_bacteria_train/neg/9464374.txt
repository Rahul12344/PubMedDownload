The arsenic resistance (ars) operon from plasmid pKW301 of Acidiphilium
multivorum AIU 301 was cloned and sequenced. This DNA sequence contains five
genes in the following order: arsR, arsD, arsA, arsB, arsC. The predicted amino
acid sequences of all of the gene products are homologous to the amino acid
sequences of the ars gene products of Escherichia coli plasmid R773 and IncN
plasmid R46. The ars operon cloned from A. multivorum conferred resistance to
arsenate and arsenite on E. coli. Expression of the ars genes with the
bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-promoter system allowed E. coli to overexpress
ArsD, ArsA, and ArsC but not ArsR or ArsB. The apparent molecular weights of
ArsD, ArsA, and ArsC were 13,000, 64,000, and 16,000, respectively. A primer
extension analysis showed that the ars mRNA started at a position 19 nucleotides 
upstream from the arsR ATG in E. coli. Although the arsR gene of A. multivorum
AIU 301 encodes a polypeptide of 84 amino acids that is smaller and less
homologous than any of the other ArsR proteins, inactivation of the arsR gene
resulted in constitutive expression of the ars genes, suggesting that ArsR of
pKW301 controls the expression of this operon.
