Retinal ganglion cells can be classified into more than 40 distinct subtypes,
whether by functional classification or transcriptomics. The examination of these
subtypes in relation to their physiology, projection patterns, and circuitry
would be greatly facilitated through the identification of specific molecular
identifiers for the generation of transgenic mice. Advances in single cell
transcriptomic profiling have enabled the identification of molecular signatures 
for cellular subtypes that are only rarely found. Therefore, we used single cell 
profiling combined with hierarchical clustering and correlate analyses to
identify genes expressed in distinct populations of Parvalbumin-expressing cells 
and functionally classified RGCs. RGCs were manually isolated based either upon
fluorescence or physiological distinction through cell-attached recordings.
Microarray hybridization and RNA-Sequencing were employed for the
characterization of transcriptomes and in situ hybridization was utilized to
further characterize gene candidate expression. Gene candidates were identified
based upon cluster correlation, as well as expression specificity within
physiologically distinct classes of RGCs. Further, we identified Prph, Ctxn3, and
Prkcq as potential candidates for ipRGC classification in the murine retina. The 
use of these genes, or one of the other newly identified subset markers, for the 
generation of a transgenic mouse would enable future studies of RGC-subtype
specific function, wiring, and projection.
