The arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
is a heterodimeric enzyme, with a 45-kDa CPA1 subunit binding and cleaving
glutamine, and a 124-kDa CPA2 subunit accepting the ammonia moiety cleaved from
glutamine, binding all of the remaining substrates and carrying out all of the
other catalytic events. CPA2 is composed of two apparently duplicated amino acid 
sequences involved in binding the two ATP molecules needed for carbamoyl
phosphate synthesis and a carboxyl-terminal domain which appears to be less
tightly folded than the remainder of the protein. Using deletion mutagenesis, we 
have established that essentially all of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CPA2 is 
required for catalytic function and that even small truncations lead to
significant changes in the CPA2 conformation. In addition, we have demonstrated
that the C-terminal region of CPA2 can be expressed as an autonomously folded
unit which is stabilized by specific interactions with the remainder of CPA2. We 
also made the unexpected finding that, even when ammonia is used as the substrate
and there is no catalytic role for CPA1, interaction with CPA1 led to an increase
in the Vmax of CPA2 in crude extracts.
