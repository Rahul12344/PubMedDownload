Chlorotoxin (CTX) is a minute 4 kDa protein made up of 36 amino acid residues,
commonly known for its binding affinity to chloride channels and matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) of glioma tumors of the spine and brain. This
property and the possibility of conjugating this peptide to nanoparticles have
enabled its diverse use in various biotechnological and biomedical applications
for cancer treatment, such as in tumor imaging and radiotherapy. Because of the
fascinating biological properties CTX possesses, elucidating its mechanism of
action may hold promise for the development of new and effective therapeutic
drugs, as well as more sensitive and highly specific cancer-screening kits. This 
article therefore reviews the currently known applications of CTX and suggests
diverse ways in which it can be applied for the design of improved drugs and
diagnostic tools for cancer.
