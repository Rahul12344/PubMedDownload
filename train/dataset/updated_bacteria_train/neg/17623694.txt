OBJECTIVES: A validated microbiological assay was used to measure concentrations 
of iclaprim (AR-100) in plasma, bronchial mucosa (BM), alveolar macrophages (AM) 
and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) after a single 1.6 mg/kg intravenous 60 min iv 
infusion of iclaprim.
METHODS: Male volunteers were randomly allocated to three nominal sampling time
intervals 1-2 h (Group A), 3-4 h (Group B) and 5.5-7.0 h (Group C) after the
start of the drug infusion.
RESULTS: Mean iclaprim concentrations in plasma, BM, AM and ELF, respectively,
were for Group A 0.59 mg/L (SD 0.18), 0.51 mg/kg (SD 0.17), 24.51 mg/L (SD 21.22)
and 12.61 mg/L (SD 7.33); Group B 0.24 mg/L (SD 0.05), 0.35 mg/kg (SD 0.17), 7.16
mg/L (SD 1.91) and 6.38 mg/L (SD 5.17); and Group C 0.14 mg/L (SD 0.05), no
detectable level in BM, 5.28 mg/L (SD 2.30) and 2.66 mg/L (SD 2.08).
CONCLUSIONS: Iclaprim concentrations in ELF and AM exceeded the MIC(90) for
penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 0.06 mg/L),
penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC90 2 mg/L), penicillin-resistant S.
pneumoniae (MIC90 4 mg/L) for 7, 7 and 4 h, respectively, and Chlamydia
pneumoniae (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) for 7 h. Mean iclaprim concentrations in ELF exceeded
the MIC90 for Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 4 mg/L) and Moraxella catarrhalis
(MIC90 8 mg/L) for up to 4 and 2 h, respectively; in AM the MIC90 was exceeded
for up to 7 h. Furthermore, the MIC90 for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus of 0.12 mg/L was exceeded at all sites for up to 7 h. These data suggest
that iclaprim reaches lung concentrations that should be effective in the
treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
