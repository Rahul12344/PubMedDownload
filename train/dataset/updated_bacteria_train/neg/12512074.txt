A new and practical method for gene recombination with formation of libraries of 
mutant genes is presented. The method is based on the assembly of appropriately
prepared oligonucleotides whose design is guided by sequence information. High
recombination frequency with formation of full-length products is achieved by
controlled overlapping of the designed oligomers. This process (ADO) minimizes
self-hybridization of parental genes, which constitutes a significant advantage
over conventional family shuffling as used in the directed evolution of
functional enzymes. ADO was applied to the recombination of two lipase family
genes from Bacillus subtilis (LipA and LipB). In a library of 3000 lipase
variants created by this method, several were found that display increased
enantioselectivity in a model reaction involving the hydrolysis of a
meso-diacetate.
