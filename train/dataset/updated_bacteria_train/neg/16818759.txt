CD1d-restricted invariant NK T (iNKT) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) have been
shown to play crucial roles in various types of immune responses, including
TLR9-dependent antiviral responses initiated by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). However,
the mechanism by which this occurs is enigmatic because TLRs are absent in iNKT
cells and human pDCs do not express CD1d. To explore this process, pDCs were
activated with CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides, which stimulated the secretion of
several cytokines such as type I and TNF-alpha. These cytokines and other soluble
factors potently induced the expression of activation markers on iNKT cells,
selectively enhanced double-negative iNKT cell survival, but did not induce their
expansion or production of cytokines. Notably, pDC-derived factors licensed iNKT 
cells to respond to myeloid DCs: an important downstream cellular target of iNKT 
cell effector function and a critical contributor to the initiation of adaptive
immune responses. This interaction supports the notion that iNKT cells can
mediate cross-talk between DC subsets known to express mutually exclusive TLR and
cytokine profiles.
