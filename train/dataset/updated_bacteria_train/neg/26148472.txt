Pachymic acid (PA) is a lanostane-type triterpenoid derived from Poria cocos
mushroom that possess various biological effects such as anti-cancer,
antiinflammatory and anti-metastasis effects. In this study, we investigated the 
anti-cancer effects of PA in EJ bladder cancer cells. The results showed that PA 
significantly inhibited proliferation of EJ cells in a dose-dependent manner. PA 
induced accumulation of sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cell population), apoptotic
bodies and chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation in EJ cells in a
dose-dependent manner. PA also induces activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and
subsequent cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and significantly suppressed
the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family proteins in a dose-dependent manner.
Furthermore, PA activates Bid and induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨm ) with up-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bad),
down-regulated anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and cytochrome c
release. In turn, PA increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS);
also, the ROS production was blocked by N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The expressions of
TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand and death receptor 5 were up-regulated by
PA in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting extrinsic pathway also involved in
PA-induced apoptosis. This study provides evidence that PA might be useful in the
treatment of human bladder cancer.
