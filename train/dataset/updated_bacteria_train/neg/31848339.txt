Liver metastases (LM) remain a major cause of cancer-associated death and a
clinical challenge. Here we explore a sexual dimorphism observed in the
regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of LM, wherein the
accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells in
colon and lung carcinoma LM is TNFR2-dependent in female, but not in male mice.
In ovariectomized mice, a marked reduction is observed in colorectal, lung and
pancreatic carcinoma LM that is reversible by estradiol reconstitution. This is
associated with reduced liver MDSC accumulation, increased
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and granzyme B production in CD8+ T cells and reduced
TNFR2, IDO2, TDO and Serpin B9 expression levels. Treatment with tamoxifen
increases liver cytotoxic T cell accumulation and reduces colon cancer LM. The
results identify estrogen as a regulator of a pro-metastatic immune
microenvironment in the liver and a potential target in the management of liver
metastatic disease.
