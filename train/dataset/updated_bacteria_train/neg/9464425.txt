We report the design and evaluation of PCR primers 63f and 1387r for
amplification of 16S rRNA genes from bacteria. Their specificity and efficacy
were tested systematically with a bacterial species and environmental samples.
They were found to be more useful for 16S rRNA gene amplification in ecological
and systematic studies than PCR amplimers that are currently more generally used.
