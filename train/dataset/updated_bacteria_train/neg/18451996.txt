Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are innate-like lymphocytes that recognize glycolipid 
antigens in the context of the MHC class I-like antigen-presenting molecule CD1d.
In vivo activation of mouse iNKT cells with the glycolipid
alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) results in the acquisition of a
hyporesponsive (anergic) phenotype by these cells. Because iNKT cells can become 
activated in the context of infectious agents, here we evaluated whether iNKT
cell activation by microorganisms can influence subsequent responses of these
cells to glycolipid antigen stimulation. We found that mouse iNKT cells activated
in vivo by multiple bacterial microorganisms, or by bacterial LPS or flagellin,
became unresponsive to subsequent activation with alpha-GalCer. This
hyporesponsive phenotype of iNKT cells required IL-12 expression and was
associated with changes in the surface phenotype of these cells, reduced severity
of concanavalin A-induced hepatitis, and alterations in the therapeutic
activities of alpha-GalCer. These findings may have important implications for
the development of iNKT cell-based therapies.
