Our purpose was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT
compared with (111)In-pentetreotide imaging for diagnosis, staging, and restaging
of pulmonary and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.METHODS:
(68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and (111)In-pentetreotide scans were obtained for 78 of 97
consecutively enrolled patients with known or suspected pulmonary or
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Safety and toxicity were measured
by comparing vital signs, serum chemistry values, or acquisition-related medical 
complications before and after (68)Ga-DOTATATE injection. Added value was
determined by changes in treatment plan when (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT results were 
added to all prior imaging, including (111)In-pentetreotide. Interobserver
reproducibility of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan interpretation was measured
between blinded and nonblinded interpreters.
RESULTS: (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and (111)In-pentetreotide scans were
significantly different in impact on treatment (P < 0.001). (68)Ga-DOTATATE
PET/CT combined with CT or liver MRI changed care in 28 of 78 (36%) patients.
Interobserver agreement between blinded and nonblinded interpreters was high. No 
participant had a trial-related event requiring treatment. Mild, transient events
were tachycardia in 1, alanine transaminase elevation in 1, and hyperglycemia in 
2 participants. No clinically significant arrhythmias occurred. (68)Ga-DOTATATE
PET/CT correctly identified 3 patients for peptide-receptor radiotherapy
incorrectly classified by (111)In-pentetreotide.
CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was equivalent or superior to
(111)In-pentetreotide imaging in all 78 patients. No adverse events requiring
treatment were observed. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT changed treatment in 36% of
participants. Given the lack of significant toxicity, lower radiation exposure,
and improved accuracy compared with (111)In-pentetreotide, (68)Ga-DOTATATE
imaging should be used instead of (111)In-pentetreotide imaging where available.
