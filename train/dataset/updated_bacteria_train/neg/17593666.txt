CD1d-restricted T cells (NKT cells) are potent regulators of a broad range of
immune responses. In particular, an abundance of research has focussed on the
role of NKT cells in tumor immunity. This field of research has been greatly
facilitated by the finding of agonist ligands capable of potently stimulating NKT
cells and also animal models where NKT cells have been shown to play a natural
role in the surveillance of tumors. Herein, we review the capability of NKT cells
to promote the rejection of tumors and the mechanisms by which this occurs. We
also highlight a growing field of research that has found that NKT cells are
capable of suppressing anti-tumor immunity and discuss the progress to date for
the immunotherapeutic use of NKT cells.
