Our expanding knowledge of microbial mechanisms is challenging the notion of
"good" versus "bad" microbes and encouraging a better understanding of their
roles in various contexts before their widespread therapeutic and clinical
application. The intestinal microbe Akkermansia muciniphila, a promising
probiotic with an emerging cautionary tale, best highlights this challenge.
