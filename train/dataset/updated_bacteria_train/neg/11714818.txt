Neutrophil migration to the site of infection is a critical early step in host
immunity to microbial pathogens, in which chemokines and their receptors play an 
important role. In this work, mice deficient in expression of the chemokine
receptor CXCR2 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii and the outcome was
monitored. Gene-deleted animals displayed completely defective neutrophil
recruitment, which was apparent at 4 h and sustained for at least 36 h.
Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) animals also displayed defective polymorphonuclear leukocyte
migration, suggesting mast cells as one source of chemokines driving the
response. Tachyzoite infection and replication were accelerated in CXCR2(-/-)
animals, resulting in establishment of higher cyst numbers in the brain relative 
to wild-type controls. Furthermore, serum and spleen cell IFN-gamma levels in
infected, gene-deleted mice were reduced 60-75% relative to infected normal
animals, and spleen cell TNF-alpha was likewise reduced by approximately 50%.
These results highlight an important role for CXCR2 in neutrophil migration,
which may be important for early control of infection and induction of immunity
during Toxoplasma infection.
