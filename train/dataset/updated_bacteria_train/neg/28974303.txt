Spatio-temporal and seasonal variation of the water quality characteristics of
the Hooghly River Estuary, India were studied considering eight stations of
diverse eco-hydrological characteristics. Wide variations in turbidity, total
dissolved solids and fecal coliform exceeded the permissible BIS drinking water
level limit. The estuary is observed to be relatively low-oxygenated, mesotropic 
and phosphate limiting. Spatial heterogeneity and impact of the southwest monsoon
were remarkably pronounced in the distribution of the inorganic nutrients
revealing the following values (expressed in μgatml-1): nitrate+nitrite
(2.42-37.19), phosphate (0.41-1.52) and silicate (38.5-187.75). Water Quality
Index (WQI) values confirmed the prevailing 'bad' condition, detrimental for
sustenance of aquatic biota. Results of Principal Component Analysis identified
the major factors liable for water quality deterioration while cluster analysis
categorized the stations on the basis of similar water quality status. The
authors recommend adopting preventive measures for water quality improvement
linked to biodiversity conservation.
