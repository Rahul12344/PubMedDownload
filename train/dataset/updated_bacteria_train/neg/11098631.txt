Over 4 years 1.241 fish were examined mycologically. In 182 (14.7%) of them
positive results were obtained. Most of the isolates belonged to the following
genera: Cladosporium, Saprolegnia, Candida and Penicillium. Fungal infections
were correlated with findings of Saprolegnia, Branchiomyces, Pythium,
Ichtyophonus and sometimes Cladosporium. Most fungal isolates were etiologically 
irrelevant for diseases or death.
