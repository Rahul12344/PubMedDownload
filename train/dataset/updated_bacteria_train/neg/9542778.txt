Thirty-two female patients with confirmed ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 33
women of similar age with pure ileitis terminalis Crohn were examined for
genitourinary infection. Urethral syndrome was found in 15 out of 32 patients
with AS: 11 of them had urethritis and 4 urethritis associated with vaginitis.
Five women of the control group suffered from urethritis. In all cases with
genitourinary infection, Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated. By comparing the
AS-patients (urogenital infection group and the non-infected group) with regard
to other present clinical parameters, it was found, as expected, that the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the 1st hour was significantly higher in the
infected group. In addition, the infected patients had a significantly higher
incidence of enthesopathy, involvement of the spinal column, and higher
C-reactive protein values (CRP > or = 5 mg/l). A family history of AS was equally
present. Other clinical parameters, such as inflammatory involvement of the
joints and HLA-B27 correlation, did not differ significantly between infected and
non-infected patients.
