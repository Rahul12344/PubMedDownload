Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) are a significant problem in all
patients with neurogenic bladder leading to high morbidity, poor quality of life 
and a limited life expectancy. For the diagnosis of UTI, a urine specimen taken
by bladder puncture or catheterization is required. In patients with neurogenic
bladders, clinical symptoms and leukocyturia must be present together with
bacteriuria in order to qualify as UTI. The spectrum of pathogens differs
significantly from that in patients with normal bladder function. Culture and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing must, therefore, be performed prior to the
initiation of antibiotic therapy. This is also important in the prevention of the
emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The main way to prevent recurrent UTI in
the neurogenic bladder is by restoring the normal low-pressure reservoir function
of the bladder and is the aim of neuro-urological management.
