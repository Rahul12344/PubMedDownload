PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to describe a case of suspected
endotoxin-induced uveitis associated with septic endogenous endophthalmitis
followed by antibiotic-induced endotoxemia.
METHODS: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of peripheral leukocytes was
studied by lymphocytotoxicity technique. Histological and immunohistochemical
studies of paraffin embedded specimen were conducted.
RESULTS: Findings of HLA typing revealed positive reaction for B 51, Cw 3, DR 8, 
DR 11, DQ 3. The vitreous body of an eviscerated eye was occupied by the
non-specific granulomatous tissue, composed of fibroblast, plasma cells, and
Sudan black staining positive foamy cells, including melaniferous phagocytes,
identified as CD 68 positive macrophage.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that antibiotic-induced endotoxemia of a patient with
septic endogenous endophthalmitis produced endotoxin-induced uveitis under an
upregulation of HLA and endotoxin activated macrophages may release cytokines,
followed by fibrin formation and subsequent granuloma.
