To determine the safety of fresh-cut vegetables packaged in modified atmosphere, 
challenge studies using both nonproteolytic and proteolytic strains of
Clostridium botulinum were performed with a variety of fresh-cut packaged salads 
and vegetables stored at different temperatures. When vegetables were inoculated 
with spores of C. botulinum and incubated in low-O2 atmospheres, spore
germination and growth and toxin production were observed. Botulinum toxin was
produced by proteolytic types A and B on onion, butternut squash, rutabaga,
salad, and stir-fry vegetables. Nonproteolytic C. botulinum produced toxin on
butternut squash and salad. Nonproteolytic C. botulinum was capable of producing 
neurotoxin at temperatures as low as 5 degree C whereas proteolytic strains
produced neurotoxin at 15 degrees C and higher. Although most samples were
visibly spoiled before detection of botulinum toxin, samples of butternut squash 
and onion remained acceptable after detection of toxin. The strict maintenance of
low temperatures (< 5 degrees C) is recommended in order to control the potential
growth of C. botulinum on fresh-cut vegetables packaged in a modified atmosphere.
