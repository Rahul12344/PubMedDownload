The adjuvant effect of Quillaja saponaria saponin (QSS) on protection of turbot
fry was investigated with immersion vaccination of formalin-killed Vibrio
anguillarum O1 and various concentrations of QSS (5, 25, 45 and 65 mg/L). Fish
were challenged at days 7, 14 and 28 post-vaccination. Significantly high
relative percent of survival (RPS) ((59.1 ± 13.6)%, (81.7 ± 8.2)%, (77.8 ± 9.6)%)
were recorded in the fish that received bacterins immersion with QSS at 45 mg/L, 
which is comparable to the positive control group vaccinated by intraperitoneal
injection (IP). Moreover, a remarkably higher serum antibody titer was also
demonstrated after 28 days in the vaccinated fish with QSS (45 mg/L) than those
vaccinated fish without QSS (p < 0.05), but lower than the IP immunized fish (p <
0.05). Significant upregulation of IgM gene expression has also been identified
in the tissues of skin, gill, spleen and kidney from the immunized fish in
comparison to the control fish. Taken together, the present study indicated that 
QSS was able to dramatically evoke systemic and mucosal immune responses in
immunized fish. Therefore, QSS might be a promising adjuvant candidate for fish
vaccination via an immersion administering route.
