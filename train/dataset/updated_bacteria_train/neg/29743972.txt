Aging is associated with the accumulation of cellular damage over the course of a
lifetime. This process is promoted in large part by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated via cellular metabolic and respiratory pathways. Pharmacological,
nonpharmacological, and genetic interventions have been used to target cellular
and mitochondrial networks in an effort to decipher aging and age-related
disorders. While ROS historically have been viewed as a detrimental byproduct of 
normal metabolism and associated with several pathologies, recent research has
revealed a more complex and beneficial role of ROS in regulating metabolism,
development, and lifespan. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in
ROS research, focusing on both the beneficial and harmful roles of ROS, many of
which are conserved across species from bacteria to humans, in various aspects of
cellular physiology. These studies provide a new context for our understanding of
the parts ROS play in health and disease. Moreover, we highlight the utility of
bacterial models to elucidate the molecular pathways by which ROS mediate aging
and aging-related diseases.
