Gavage of mice, immunised with an inactivated S. typhimurium vaccine, with
Andrographis paniculata extract [APE] or andrographolide [AND] resulted in an
enhancement of Salmonella-specific antibody response and induction of
cell-mediated response against salmonellosis. Mice were vaccinated with either
one or two doses of killed S. typhimurium vaccine and fed two different
quantities of APE or AND, for 14 days in mice immunised with one dose of the
vaccine, and for 28 days in mice immunised with two doses of vaccine,
respectively. Both APE and AND were found to enhance IgG antibody levels against 
S. typhimurium, the enhancement being statistically significant in mice receiving
two doses of the vaccine. Splenocyte cultures, prepared from mice immunised with 
the killed Salmonella vaccine and treated with APE or AND, showed a remarkable
increase in the production IFN-gamma following stimulation with the bacterial
lysate, indicating an induction of Salmonella-specific cell-mediated
response/immune response.
