Crystallographic analysis of mutant human haemoglobins made in Escherichia coli.

Luisi BF, Nagai K.

The expression of beta-globin in Escherichia coli has enabled us to study the
functional role of individual amino-acid residues in haemoglobin (Hb) by
site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast to mammalian Hbs, some teleost fish
haemoglobins show a drastic lowering of oxygen affinity and cooperativity at low 
pH, a phenomenon known as the Root effect. We have produced the two mutant
haemoglobins Hb Nymphéas [Cys(F9)93 beta----Ser] and Hb Daphne [His(H21)143
beta----Arg, Cys(F9)93 beta----Ser] to investigate this allosteric property.
Although these substitutions were thought to be responsible for the Root effect, 
Hb Nymphéas and Hb Daphne show an increased oxygen affinity and a reduced effect 
of pH on oxygen affinity. Our X-ray crystallographic studies show that the
hydroxyl group of Ser 93 beta forms a hydrogen bond with Asp 94 beta which is in 
equilibrium with the salt bridge between Asp 94 beta and His 146 beta. The
oxygen-binding properties of Hbs Nymphéas and Daphne are accounted for by the
partial disruption of the salt bridge.
