Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen particularly because it harbors
multiple virulence factors. It causes several types of infection, including
dermatitis, endocarditis, and infections of the urinary tract, eye, ear, bone,
joints and, of particular interest, the respiratory tract. Patients with cystic
fibrosis, who are extremely susceptible to Pseudomonas infections, have a bad
prognosis and high mortality. An important virulence factor of P. aeruginosa,
shared with many other gram-negative bacteria, is the type III secretion system, 
a hollow molecular needle that transfers effector toxins directly from the
bacterium into the host cell cytosol. This complex macromolecular machine works
in a highly regulated manner and can manipulate the host cell in many different
ways. Here we review the current knowledge of the structure of the P. aeruginosa 
T3SS, as well as its function and recognition by the immune system. Furthermore, 
we describe recent progress in the development and use of therapeutic agents
targeting the T3SS.
