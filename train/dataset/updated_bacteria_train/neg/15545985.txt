NKT cells are a unique T lymphocyte sublineage that has been implicated in the
regulation of immune responses associated with a broad range of diseases,
including autoimmunity, infectious diseases, and cancer. In stark contrast to
both conventional T lymphocytes and other types of Tregs, NKT cells are reactive 
to the nonclassical class I antigen-presenting molecule CD1d, and they recognize 
glycolipid antigens rather than peptides. Moreover, they can either up- or
downregulate immune responses by promoting the secretion of Th1, Th2, or immune
regulatory cytokines. This review will explore the diverse influences of these
cells in various disease models, their ability to suppress or enhance immunity,
and the potential for manipulating these cells as a novel form of immunotherapy.
