We have developed a screening assay by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to
identify inhibitors for the bacterial essential enzymes MurA, -B, and -C.
Libraries of compounds were synthesized using the mix-and-split combinatorial
chemistry approach. Screening of the pooled compounds using the developed assay
revealed the presence of many pools active in vitro. Pools of interest were
tested for antibacterial activity. Individual molecules in the active pools were 
synthesized and retested with the TLC assay and with bacteria. We focused on the 
best five compounds for further analysis. They were tested for inhibition on each
of the three enzymes separately, and showed no inhibition of MurA or MurB
activity but were all inhibitors of MurC enzyme. This approach yielded
interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antibacterial agents.
