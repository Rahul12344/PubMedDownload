In a random samples test altogether 4337 sheep of varying ages from several herds
of different sizes in the middle region of Thuringia were investigated with
complement fixing test for the existence of Q fever. In 47.1 per cent of the
tested herds and in 5 from 8 of the included districts Q fever reagents were
provable. The serological detection quota of all tested sheep amounts to 1.11 per
cent, but the percentage of serological reagents in mother-sheep was 1.36 per
cent, in the female young sheep 1.04 per cent and in the lambs 0.74 per cent. The
investigations of rams and sheep for slaughter were negative. Serological testing
in 7 sheep showed a Q fever antibody persistence about 6 until 10 months.
Increased animal concentration and adverse conditions led to an increase of the Q
fever seroprevalence in the herds.
