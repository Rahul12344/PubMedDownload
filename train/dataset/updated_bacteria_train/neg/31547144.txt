Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers and the second leading 
cause of cancer-related deaths. Discrepancies in clinical outcomes are observed
even among patients with same-stage CRC due to molecular heterogeneity. Thus,
biomarkers for predicting prognosis in CRC patients are urgently needed. We
previously demonstrated that stage II CRC patients with NKX6.1 methylation had
poor 5-year overall survival. However, the methylation frequency of NKX6.1 was
only 23% in 151 pairs of CRC tissues. Thus, we aimed to develop a more robust
prognostic panel for CRC using NKX6.1 in combination with three genes: LIM
homeobox transcription factor 1Î± (LMX1A), sex-determining region Y-box 1 (SOX1), 
and zinc finger protein 177 (ZNF177). Through quantitative methylation analysis, 
we found that LMX1A, SOX1, and ZNF177 were hypermethylated in CRC tissues. LMX1A 
methylation was significantly associated with poor 5-year overall, and
disease-free survivals in stage I and II CRC patients. Sensitivity and
specificity analyses of the four-gene combination revealed the best sensitivity
and optimal specificity. Moreover, patients with the four-gene methylation
profile exhibited poorer disease-free survival than those without methylation. A 
significant effect of the four-gene methylation status on overall survival and
disease-free survival was observed in early stage I and II CRC patients (p =
0.0016 and p = 0.0230, respectively). Taken together, these results demonstrate
that the combination of the methylation statuses of NKX6.1, LMX1A, SOX1, and
ZNF177 creates a novel prognostic panel that could be considered a molecular
marker for outcomes in CRC patients.
