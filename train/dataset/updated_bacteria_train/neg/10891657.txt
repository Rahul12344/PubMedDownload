We have identified a homologue of the adhesin AIDA-I of Escherichia coli in
Neisseria meningitidis. This gene was designated nhhA (Neisseria hia homologue), 
as analysis of the complete coding sequence revealed that it is more closely
related to the adhesins Hia and Hsf of Haemophilus influenzae. The sequence of
nhhA was determined from 10 strains, and found to be highly conserved. Studies of
the localisation by Western immunoblot analysis of total cell proteins and outer 
membrane complex preparations and by immunogold electron microscopy revealed that
NhhA is located in the outer membrane. A strain survey showed that nhhA is
present in 85/85 strains of N. meningitidis representative of all the major
disease-associated serogroups, based on Southern blot analysis. It is expressed
in the majority of strains tested by Western immunoblot.
