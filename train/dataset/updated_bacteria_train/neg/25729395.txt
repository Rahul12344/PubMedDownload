PURPOSE: We investigated the molecular types of uropathogenic Escherichia coli
(UPEC) by using conventional phylogrouping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
and fimH genotyping.
METHODS: Samples of patients younger than 18 years of age were collected from the
Chung-Ang University Hospital over 2 years. Conventional phylogenetic grouping
for UPEC strains was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacterial
strain sequence types (STs) were classified on the basis of the results of
partial sequencing of seven housekeeping genes. In addition, we analyzed
nucleotide variations in a 424-base pair fragment of fimH, a major virulence
factor in UPEC.
RESULTS: Sixty-four UPEC isolates were analyzed in this study. Phylogenetic
grouping revealed that group B2 was the most common type (n=54, 84%). We
identified 16 distinctive STs using MLST. The most common STs were ST95 (35.9%), 
ST73 (15.6%), ST131 (12.5%), ST69 (7.8%), and ST14 (6.3%). Fourteen fimH allele
types were identified, of which 11 had been previously reported, and the
remaining three were identified in this study. f1 (n=28, 45.2%) was found to be
the most common allele type, followed by f6 and f9 (n=7, 11.3% each). Comparative
analysis of the results from the three different molecular typing techniques
revealed that both MLST and fimH typing generated more discriminatory UPEC types 
than did PCR-based phylogrouping.
CONCLUSION: We characterized UPEC molecular types isolated from Korean children
by MLST and fimH genotyping. fimH genotyping might serve as a useful molecular
test for large epidemiologic studies of UPEC isolates.
