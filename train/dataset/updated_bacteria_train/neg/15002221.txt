The incidence of tuberculosis in Poland is about 2-3 times higher than average
for EU countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiology of
tuberculosis in Silesia Voivodship against the background of the country of
Poland. The paper presents actual TB epidemiology situation (incidence,
prevalence, morbidity and mortality from TB in Silesia and in Poland) as well as 
its trends observed between 1990-2000. The regional incidence in 2000 was 15%
lower than in 1990, but 35.4 per 100,000 population is still higher than 29.7 per
100,000 observed in Poland. The incidence of tuberculosis increases with age, 1.2
in children aged 0-14 years up to 58.1 among 65 and older. In 2000 incidence in
the age groups 20-44 and 45-64 years (36.7 and 57.4, respectively) was much
higher than average observed in Poland (28.0 and 47.2, respectively), as well the
proportion of new cases in this age groups (38.8 and 40.2%, respectively). The TB
incidence in men (51.8) is 2.6 times higher than in women (20.0). Between
1998-2000 in Silesia Voivodship prevalence was growing and in 2000 it was 56.9
per 100,000. In 2000 TB mortality was almost two times higher in Silesia (5.1)
than average in Poland (2.7) and opposite to trends observed in the country, it
was 11% higher than in 1990. Epidemiological situation of tuberculosis in Silesia
Voivodsip is bad. To correct this situation it is necessary to improve the
process of fast diagnosis and effective therapy.
