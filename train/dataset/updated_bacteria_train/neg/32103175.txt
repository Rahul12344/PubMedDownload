Cancer recurrence after surgery remains an unresolved clinical problem1-3.
Myeloid cells derived from bone marrow contribute to the formation of the
premetastatic microenvironment, which is required for disseminating tumour cells 
to engraft distant sites4-6. There are currently no effective interventions that 
prevent the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment6,7. Here we show
that, after surgical removal of primary lung, breast and oesophageal cancers,
low-dose adjuvant epigenetic therapy disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment 
and inhibits both the formation and growth of lung metastases through its
selective effect on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In mouse models of 
pulmonary metastases, MDSCs are key factors in the formation of the premetastatic
microenvironment after resection of primary tumours. Adjuvant epigenetic therapy 
that uses low-dose DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors,
5-azacytidine and entinostat, disrupts the premetastatic niche by inhibiting the 
trafficking of MDSCs through the downregulation of CCR2 and CXCR2, and by
promoting MDSC differentiation into a more-interstitial macrophage-like
phenotype. A decreased accumulation of MDSCs in the premetastatic lung produces
longer periods of disease-free survival and increased overall survival, compared 
with chemotherapy. Our data demonstrate that, even after removal of the primary
tumour, MDSCs contribute to the development of premetastatic niches and
settlement of residual tumour cells. A combination of low-dose adjuvant
epigenetic modifiers that disrupts this premetastatic microenvironment and
inhibits metastases may permit an adjuvant approach to cancer therapy.
