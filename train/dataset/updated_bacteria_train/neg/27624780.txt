Specific components of the intestinal microbiota are capable of influencing
immune responses such that a mutualistic relationship is established. In mice,
colonization with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) induces T-helper-17 (Th17)
cell differentiation in the intestine, yet the effector functions of interleukin 
(IL)-17A in response to SFB remain incompletely understood. Here we report that
colonization of mice with SFB-containing microbiota induced IL-17A- and
CXCR2-dependent recruitment of neutrophils to the ileum. This response required
adaptive immunity, as Rag-deficient mice colonized with SFB-containing microbiota
failed to induce IL-17A, CXCL1 and CXCL2, and displayed defective neutrophil
recruitment to the ileum. Interestingly, neutrophil depletion in wild-type mice
resulted in significantly augmented Th17 responses and SFB expansion, which
correlated with impaired expression of IL-22 and antimicrobial peptides. These
data provide novel insight into a dynamic IL-17A-CXCR2-neutrophil axis during
acute SFB colonization and demonstrate a central role for neutrophils in limiting
SFB expansion.
