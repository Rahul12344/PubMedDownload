Coronary collateral growth (CCG) is impaired in metabolic syndrome. microRNA-21
(miR-21) is a proproliferative and antiapoptotic miR, which we showed to be
elevated in metabolic syndrome. Here we investigate whether impaired CCG in
metabolic syndrome involved miR-21-mediated aberrant apoptosis. Normal
Sprague-Dawley (SD) and metabolic syndrome [J. C. Russel (JCR)] rats underwent
transient, repetitive coronary artery occlusion [repetitive ischemia (RI)].
Antiapoptotic Bcl-2, phospho-Bad, and Bcl-2/Bax dimers were increased on days 6
and 9 RI, and proapoptotic Bax and Bax/Bax dimers and cytochrome-c release
concurrently decreased in JCR versus SD rats. Active caspases were decreased in
JCR versus SD rats (~50%). Neutrophils increased transiently on day 3 RI in the
collateral-dependent zone of SD rats but remained elevated in JCR rats,
paralleling miR-21 expression. miR-21 downregulation by anti-miR-21 induced
neutrophil apoptosis and decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax dimers (~75%) while
increasing Bax/Bax dimers, cytochrome-c release, and caspase activation (~70,
400, and 400%). Anti-miR-21 also improved CCG in JCR rats (~60%). Preventing
neutrophil infiltration with blocking antibodies resulted in equivalent CCG
recovery, confirming a major role for deregulated neutrophil apoptosis in CCG
impairment. Neutrophil and miR-21-dependent CCG inhibition was in significant
part mediated by increased oxidative stress. We conclude that neutrophil
apoptosis is integral to normal CCG and that inappropriate prolonged
miR-21-mediated survival of neutrophils plays a major role in impaired CCG, in
part via oxidative stress generation.
