In 290 Q fever positive cattle from three 2000 head dairy farms in the former
district of Erfurt (Thüringen) the course of titers was examined serologically
over several months by means of the complement fixation test (CFT). In 47.2% of
the cows serologically observed for 2 up to 28 months complement fixing
antibodies against Coxiella burnetii could be demonstrated til the end of the
investigation period. Repeated tests during pregnancy showed increase of antibody
titers in the first 4 months and after a short decrease again from the 5. til the
7. month. By observing the antibody titers during several pregnancies each time a
new increase comparable to a booster immunisation could be found. This may
explain the persistence of Q fever antibodies in cows for several years. The
results of this investigation suggest that from a high antibody titer it can not 
be concluded an abortion in a positive cow being caused by a Coxiella burnetii
infection.
