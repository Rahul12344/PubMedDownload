A total of 604 Escherichia coli strains isolated from weaned pigs with diarrhea
or edema disease on 653 swine farms were screened for the presence of the adhesin
involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA) gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Escherichia coli isolates that carried AIDA genes were also tested by PCR for the
detection of 5 fimbriae (F4, F5, F6, F18, and F41), 3 heat-stable (STa, STb, and 
EAST1) and 1 heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin, and Shiga toxin 2e (Stx2e) genes.
Forty-five (7.5%) of the 604 E. coli isolates carried the gene for AIDA. Of these
45 isolates, 5 (11.1%) carried EAST1 genes only, 1 (2.2%) carried genes for at
least one of the fimbrial adhesins, 12 (26.7%) carried genes for at least one of 
the toxins, and 27 (60%) carried genes for at least one of the fimbrial adhesins 
and toxins. Fifty-one percent of strains that carried AIDA genes carried Stx2e
genes, and 40% of strains that carried AIDA genes carried F18ab. The isolation
rate of enterotoxigenic E. coli strain carrying genes for AIDA was 87%, and the
isolation rate of Shiga toxin-producing E. coil strain carrying genes for AIDA
was 49%. AIDA may represent an important virulence determinant in pigs with
postweaning diarrhea or edema disease.
