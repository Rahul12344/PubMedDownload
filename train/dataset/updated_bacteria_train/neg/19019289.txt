Aspergillus is involved in various lung illnesses related to type of exposition
and immunity host response, local (tracheobronchial) and global. Allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is due to a hypersensitivity response, diagnosis
must be considered in presence of severe asthma with radiologic opacities, blood 
eosinophilia and elevated total serum IgE levels. Bronchial colonization is often
accidentally discovered, but needs a monitoring. Pulmonary aspergilloma, often
asymptomatic, grows in a preexisting cavity. Aspergillus bronchitis is a
prolonged superficious endobronchial infection. Pseudomembranous necrotizing
tracheobronchitis is a microinvasive bronchial infection, which prognosis is very
bad. Acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis affects quite always
immunocompromised patients, but cases are not exceptional in patients with prior 
lung disease. Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis may be divided in
chronic cavitary and chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis, and subacute
invasive aspergillosis according to the course of the disease, radiological
outcome first. Management of diseases caused by Aspergillus is evolving with new 
diagnostic tools (PCR, Aspergillus antigenemia) and with new generation
antifungal drugs.
