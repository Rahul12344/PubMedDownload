AIMS: To assess diabetic patients' knowledge and practices regarding foot care.
METHODS: This study was conducted as a cross-sectional study in 1030 patients
between November 2017 and February 2018.The descriptive survey instrument was
developed by the investigators. Survey content and format were based on prior
surveys and guidelines. The survey sought socio-demographic characteristics of
the patients and the level of knowledge about diabetic foot care practice.
RESULTS: 29.5% of patients had bad foot care, 49.6% of patients had moderate foot
care and 20.8% of patients had good foot care. There were no significant
differences between patient groups in regard to age, gender, foot infection
history and having undergone amputation surgery. We found that patients who good 
at foot care had higher education status (p<0.001), were more likely live in a
city (p<0.001), had higher income (p<0.001), had been trained about foot care
(p<0.001) and were more likely to have type I DM (p=0.015). Disease duration was 
longer in those who had good foot care compared to the other groups (p=0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: The mean knowledge and practice scores of our patients were
moderate, indicating that much is to be done for the education of patients on
this matter. We also found that knowledge about the importance of this practice, 
education status and disease duration had significant influence on the practice
of foot-care in patients with DM.
