Helicobacter pylori therapy demystified.

We discuss the role of comparators in Helicobacter pylori treatment trials and
why anti-H. pylori therapeutic trials (an infectious disease) are fundamentally
different from common gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., the absence of a placebo
response, the expectation that cure rates in excess of 95%, and the ability to
understand why treatment fails). No comparator is absolutely required other than 
to 100% success and comparison trials should be limited to comparisons between
therapies that reliably achieve 90% or greater success (i.e., good therapies).
Comparisons with known low success regimens (i.e., bad therapies) are unethical
as is withholding information from the subject regarding current effectiveness of
a regimen even if that information would reduce the likelihood that the subject
would volunteer. We also discuss how it is possible to predict the outcome of a
published but locally untried new regimen. The reason for different outcomes of
typical gastrointestinal therapies is shrouded in mystery. In contrast, treatment
success for H. pylori should be predictable and treatment failures explainable.
For too long expectations and analyses of H. pylori therapy has been confused
with what is appropriate for gastrointestinal disease such as constipation or
irritable bowel syndrome rather than for infectious diseases such as pneumonia.
