alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) have traditionally been viewed as receptors for
peptide antigens presented by either Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class
I (for CD8 T cells) or MHC class II (for CD4 T cells) antigen-presenting
molecules. However, it is now clear that some T cell lineages express TCRs that
are specialized for recognition of lipid-based antigens presented by the MHC
class I-like CD1 family. Recently, the molecular basis for the TCR recognition of
glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d has revealed an evolutionarily
conserved-docking mode that is distinct from that of peptide-based recognition. T
cells carrying these receptors follow a unique developmental pathway that results
not only in unconventional antigen specificity, but also seemingly exaggerated
functional capabilities, which makes these cells and their antigens highly
attractive targets for immunotherapeutic manipulation.
