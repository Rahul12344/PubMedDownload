We characterized the diversity of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) associated
with South African gold mine boreholes and deep aquifer systems in Washington
State, USA. Sterile cartridges filled with crushed country rock were installed on
two hydrologically isolated and chemically distinct sites at depths of 3.2 and
2.7 km below the land surface (kmbls) to allow development of biofilms.
Enrichments of sulphate-reducing chemolithotrophic (H2) and organotrophic
(lactate) bacteria were established from each site under both meso- and
thermophilic conditions. Dissimilatory sulphite reductase (Dsr) and 16S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) genes amplified from DNA extracted from the cartridges were most
closely related to the Gram-positive species Desulfotomaculum thermosapovorans
and Desulfotomaculum geothermicum, or affiliated with a novel deeply branching
clade. The dsr sequences recovered from the Washington State deep aquifer systems
affiliated closely with the South African sequences, suggesting that
Gram-positive sulphate-reducing bacteria are widely distributed in the deep
subsurface.
