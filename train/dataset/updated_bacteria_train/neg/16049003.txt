MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) regulates the recognition and 
repair of DNA double strand breaks in mammalian cells through its interactions
with nuclear foci containing the COOH-terminally phosphorylated form of the
histone variant, H2AX. Here we demonstrate that the tandem BRCT repeats of MDC1
directly bind to the phosphorylated tail of H2AX-Ser(P)-Gln-Glu-Tyr, in a manner 
that is critically dependent on the free carboxylate group of the COOH-terminal
Tyr residue. We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of the MDC1 BRCT
repeats at 1.45 Angstroms resolution. By a comparison with the structure of the
BRCA1 BRCT bound to a phosphopeptide, we suggest that two arginine residues in
MDC1, Arg(1932) and Arg(1933) may recognize the COOH terminus of the peptide as
well as the penultimate Glu of H2AX, while Gln(2013) may provide additional
specificity for the COOH-terminal Tyr.
