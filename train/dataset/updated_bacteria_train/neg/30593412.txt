Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a metabolite of tryptophan formed enzymatically along
kynurenine pathway in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. It was suggested that 
yeast may produce KYNA during the fermentation process. Since KYNA was found to
interact with alcohol metabolism by inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity
the aim of this study was to measure the content of KYNA in selected alcoholic
beverages of various type, beer, wine, mead and spirits. Moreover, the absorption
and elimination rate of KYNA administered as a beverage was investigated in
humans. Twelve healthy volunteers (6 female and 6 male) were studied. Fifty six
samples of alcoholic beverages were of commercial origin. KYNA was determined by 
means of high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorometric
detection. KYNA was identified in all studied beverages. The amounts of KYNA
found in various types of beverages differed significantly: mead
9.4-38.1 µg/100 ml, wine 1.4-10.9 µg/100 ml, beer 0.1-5.2 µg/100 ml, spirits
0.01-0.1 µg/100 ml. In human, it was found that KYNA is rapidly absorbed from
digestive tract reaching its maximal concentration in blood 30 min after
administration. Thus, the potential interaction between KYNA and alcohol
occurring in human body after ingestion of alcoholic beverages was proven.
