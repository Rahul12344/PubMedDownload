OBJECTIVES: To determine blood Brucella DNA loads between brucellosis patients
and those without brucellosis.
METHODS: The patient group included 350 brucellosis patients. The control was
composed of 200 subjects without brucellosis. The extracted DNA from blood was
tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The cutoff value was
determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A portion of the 
brucellosis patients were monitored by qPCR during therapy.
RESULTS: The detection limit of qPCR was between 1E+01cfu/μL and 1E+08cfu/μL. The
standard curve R2 reached 0.998. The cutoff value was 4E+01cfu/μL, which was
determined by comparison of the patient group and the control. The qPCR assay had
a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 93.14%. The monitoring results showed 
that the Brucella DNA load decreased in most patients during the first 4 weeks of
treatment. One patient with bad treatment compliance showed a rebound.
CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR results were in accordance with the course of brucellosis
in the clinic. The DNA load often reflects the situation of the Brucella-infected
patient. The cutoff value provides an important reference of infection. This
qPCR-based method can be used to assist in the diagnosis of brucellosis and to
adjust the therapy.
