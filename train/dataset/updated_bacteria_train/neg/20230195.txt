IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing
throughout the world and is currently rising faster than any other cancer in men 
and second only to lung cancer in women. Current strategies focused on systemic
therapy for treatment of melanoma have shown no effect on survival. Therefore
there is a pressing need for developing novel targeted therapeutics.
AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Our goal is to provide an overview regarding
targeting CXCR1/2 in malignant melanoma, the rationale behind these approaches
and the future perspective.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review illustrates our current understanding of
CXCR1/2 receptor in melanoma progression and metastasis. We describe approaches
that are being developed to block CXCR1/2 activation, including
low-molecular-weight antagonists, modified chemokines and antibodies directed
against ligands and receptors.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 and their ligands play
an important role in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma. Recent reports
demonstrated that CXCR1 is constitutively expressed in all melanoma cases
irrespective of stage and grade, however, CXCR2 expression was restricted to
aggressive melanoma tumors,. Furthermore, modulation of CXCR1/2 expression and/or
activity has been shown to regulate malignant melanoma growth, angiogenesis and
metastasis, suggesting CXCR1/2 targeting as a novel therapeutic approach for
malignant melanoma.
