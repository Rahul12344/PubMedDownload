BACKGROUND: T lymphocytes are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis; > 80% of T lymphocytes that infiltrate psoriatic lesions express the
surface glycoprotein cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), compared with
< 20% in the blood. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) B is an effective treatment for 
psoriasis.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of UVB treatment of psoriasis on the
expression of CLA and several other surface markers expressed by circulating T
lymphocytes.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from psoriatic patients were stained 
for adhesion molecules and stimulated with streptococcal antigens before and once
weekly during 3 weeks of UVB treatment.
RESULTS: A marked and progressive decrease was observed during the treatment in
expression of the CLA and the very late antigen-4alpha by T cells; this decrease 
correlated closely with clinical improvement (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index).
T-cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was not significantly
affected during the treatment and no change was observed in the activation
markers CD25 and CD69 or lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation with
streptococcal antigens or superantigens.
CONCLUSIONS: UVB treatment is associated with a marked reduction in the
expression of skin-homing molecules by circulating T cells. This may be relevant 
to the therapeutic effect of UVB in psoriasis.
