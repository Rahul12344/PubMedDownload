Mammary carcinoma cells produce pro-angiogenic factors to stimulate angiogenesis 
and tumor growth. Trefoil factor-3 (TFF3) is an oncogene secreted from mammary
carcinoma cells and associated with poor prognosis. Herein, we demonstrate that
TFF3 produced in mammary carcinoma cells functions as a promoter of tumor
angiogenesis. Forced expression of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells promoted
proliferation, survival, invasion and in vitro tubule formation of human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). MCF7-TFF3 cells with forced expression 
of TFF3 generated tumors with enhanced microvessel density as compared to tumors 
formed by vector control cells. Depletion of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells by
siRNA concordantly decreased the angiogenic behavior of HUVEC. Forced expression 
of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells stimulated IL-8 transcription and subsequently
enhanced IL-8 expression in both mammary carcinoma cells and HUVEC. Depletion of 
IL-8 in mammary carcinoma cells with forced expression of TFF3, or antibody
inhibition of IL-8, partially abrogated mammary carcinoma cell TFF3-stimulated
HUVEC angiogenic behavior in vitro, as did inhibition of the IL-8 receptor,
CXCR2. Depletion of STAT3 by siRNA in MCF-7 cells with forced expression of TFF3 
partially diminished the angiogenic capability of TFF3 on stimulation of cellular
processes of HUVEC. Exogenous recombinant hTFF3 also directly promoted the
angiogenic behavior of HUVEC. Hence, TFF3 is a potent angiogenic factor and
functions as a promoter of de novo angiogenesis in mammary carcinoma, which may
co-coordinate with the growth promoting and metastatic actions of TFF3 in mammary
carcinoma to enhance tumor progression.
