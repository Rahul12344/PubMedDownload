Flavobacterium species cause significant disease in salmonid farming worldwide,
typically seen as mortality in sac fry and later as necrosis and ulceration in
fingerlings and fry. In this study, we sampled Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and
Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus from 5 Icelandic fish farms in 2014 and 2017,
where flavobacteria were suspected to cause disease. The objective of the study
was to identify and characterise the bacteria by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene and
multilocus sequence type housekeeping genes. We found 5 distinct groups of
flavobacteria: 3 that were homogeneous and appeared to persist in the fish farms 
between 2014 and 2017 and 2 that were heterogeneous and transient. Flavobacterium
psychrophilum could be isolated from diseased Arctic char from all 5 fish farms
in both 2014 and 2017. However, while the other 4 Flavobacterium sp. groups were 
isolated from Atlantic salmon, water and roe, F. psychrophilum could not be
isolated from these samples. This indicates that flavobacteria other than F.
psychrophilum may be the primary cause of fin and tail rot in Icelandic Atlantic 
salmon fry.
