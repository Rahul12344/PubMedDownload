BACKGROUND: The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) of China is an extensive pastoral and
semi-pastoral area, and because of poverty and bad hygiene conditions, Brucella
is highly prevalent in this region. In order to adequately prevent this disease
in the QTP region it is important to determine the identity of Brucella species
that caused the infection.
METHODS: A total of 65 Brucella isolates were obtained from human, livestock and 
wild animals in Qinghai, a Chinese province in east of the QTP. Two molecular
typing methods, MLVA (multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis) and
MLST (multi locus sequence typing) were used to identify the species and
genotypes of these isolates.
FINDINGS: Both MLVA and MLST typing methods classified the 65 isolates into three
species, B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, which included 60, 4 and 1
isolates respectively. The MLVA method uniquely detected 34 (Bm01 ~ Bm34), 3
(Ba01 ~ Ba03), and 1 (Bs01) MLVA-16 genotypes for B. melitensis, B. abortus and
B. suis, respectively. However, none of these genotypes exactly matched any of
the genotypes in the Brucella2012 MLVA database. The MLST method identified five 
known ST types: ST7 and ST8 (B. melitensis), ST2 and ST5 (B. abortus), and ST14
(B. suis). We also detected a strain with a mutant type (3-2-3-2-?-5-3-8-2) of
ST8 (3-2-3-2-1-5-3-8-2). Extensive genotype-sharing events could be observed
among isolates from different host species.
CONCLUSIONS: There were at least three Brucella (B. melitensis, B. abortus and B.
suis) species in Qinghai, of which B. melitensis was the predominant species in
the area examined. The Brucella population in Qinghai was very different from
other regions of the world, possibly owing to the unique geographical
characteristics such as extremely high altitude in QTP. There were extensive
genotype-sharing events between isolates obtained from humans and other animals. 
Yaks, sheep and blue sheep were important zoonotic reservoirs of brucellosis
causing species found in humans.
