receptors during vertebrate evolution.

The chemokine receptors CXCR1-3 bind to 11 chemokines (CXCL1-11) that are
clustered on the same chromosome in mammals but are largely missing in ray-finned
fish. A second CXCR1/2, and a CXCR3a and CXCR3b gene have been cloned in rainbow 
trout. Analysis of CXCR1-R3 genes in lobe-finned fish, ray-finned fish and
tetrapod genomes revealed that the teleostomian ancestor likely possessed loci
containing both CXCR1 and CXCR2, and CXCR3a and CXCR3b. Based on this synteny
analysis the first trout CXCR1/2 gene was renamed CXCR1, and the new gene CXCR2. 
The CXCR1/R2 locus was shown to have further expanded in ray-finned fish. In
relation to CXCR3, mammals appear to have lost CXCR3b and birds both CXCR3a and
CXCR3b during evolution. Trout CXCR1-R3 have distinct tissue expression patterns 
and are differentially modulated by PAMPs, proinflammatory cytokines and
infections. They are highly expressed in macrophages and neutrophils, with CXCR1 
and CXCR2 also expressed in B-cells.
