OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma glutamine levels can be used as an
indicator of exercise-induced stress, and to consider the possible effects of low
plasma glutamine concentrations on the immune system.
METHODS: We used two exercise regimens: in Trial 1 seven male subjects were
randomly stressed on a treadmill at 0, 30%, 60%, 90% and 120% of their maximal
oxygen uptake (VO2max); in Trial 2 five highly trained male subjects underwent
intensive interval training sessions twice daily for ten days, followed by a
six-day recovery period.
RESULTS: Plasma glutamine concentrations decreased significantly from an average 
of 1244 +/- 121 mumol/L to 702 +/- 101 mumol/L after acute exercise at 90% VO2max
(P < 0.05) and to 560 +/- 79 mumol/L at 120% VO2max (P < 0.001). Four of the five
subjects showed reduced plasma glutamine concentrations by Day 6 of the overload 
training trial, with all subjects displaying significantly lower glutamine levels
by Day 11. However, glutamine levels showed a variable rate of recovery over the 
six-day recovery period, with two subjects' levels remaining low by Day 16.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced plasma glutamine concentrations may provide a good
indication of severe exercise stress.
