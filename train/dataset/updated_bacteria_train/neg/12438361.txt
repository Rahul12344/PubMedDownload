The mce1A gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was initially identified by its
ability to promote uptake of Escherichia coli into HeLa cells. It was
subsequently shown that this activity was confined to a 58-amino-acid region of
the protein. A 72-amino-acid fragment (InvX) incorporating this active peptide
was expressed in E. coli as a fusion to the AIDA (adhesin involved in diffuse
adherence) autotransporter translocator, and its stable expression on the surface
of the bacterium was demonstrated. Recombinant E. coli expressing InvX-AIDA
showed extensive association with HeLa cells, and InvX was shown to be sufficient
for internalization. Uptake was found to be both microtubule and microfilament
dependent and required the Rho family of GTPases. Thus, the E. coli AIDA system
facilitated both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the functional
domain of a heterologous protein.
