The rapid and robust immunoregulatory cytokine response of Va14Ja18 natural T
(iNKT) cells to glycolipid Ags determines their diverse functions. Unlike
conventional T cells, iNKT lymphocyte ontogeny absolutely requires NF-kappa B
signaling. However, the precise role of NF-kappa B in iNKT cell function and the 
identity of upstream signals that activate NF-kappa B in this T cell subset
remain unknown. Using mice in which iNKT cell ontogeny has been rescued despite
inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling, we demonstrate that iNKT cell function
requires NF-kappa B in a lymphocyte-intrinsic manner. Furthermore, the ontogeny
of functional iNKT cells requires signaling through protein kinase C theta, which
is dispensable for conventional T lymphocyte development. The unique requirement 
of protein kinase C theta implies that signals emanating from the TCR activate
NF-kappa B during iNKT cell development and function. Thus, we conclude that
NF-kappa B signaling plays a crucial role at distinct levels of iNKT cell
biology.
