The Mur ligases play an essential role in the biosynthesis of bacterial
peptidoglycan and hence are attractive antibacterial targets. A screen of the
AstraZeneca compound library led to the identification of compound A, a
pyrazolopyrimidine, as a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa MurC. However, cellular activity against E. coli or P. aeruginosa was 
not observed. Compound A was active against efflux pump mutants of both strains. 
Experiments using an E. coli tolC mutant revealed accumulation of the MurC
substrate and a decrease in the level of product upon treatment with compound A
,: indicating inhibition of MurC enzyme in these cells. Such a modulation was not
observed in the E. coli wild-type cells. Further, overexpression of MurC in the
E. coli tolC mutant led to an increase in the compound A MIC by ≥16-fold,
establishing a correlation between MurC inhibition and cellular activity. In
addition, estimation of the intracellular compound A level showed an accumulation
of the compound over time in the tolC mutant strain. A significant compound A
level was not detected in the wild-type E. coli strain even upon treatment with
high concentrations of the compound. Therefore, the lack of MIC and absence of
MurC inhibition in wild-type E. coli were possibly due to suboptimal compound
concentration as a consequence of a high efflux level and/or poor permeativity of
compound A.
