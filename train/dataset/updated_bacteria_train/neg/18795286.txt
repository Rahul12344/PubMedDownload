Aiming to increase production of recombinant streptavidin in Escherichia coli,
the effect of different leader sequences, different promoter strengths of the
bacteriocin release protein (kil), host strain and medium composition on the
expression and secretion into the medium was investigated. Expression vectors
containing an expression or secretion unit were constructed with different
combinations of leader sequence for the streptavidin gene and promoters for the
kil gene and streptavidin gene. Results showed that a high-level extracellular
production of streptavidin could be accomplished with E. coli BL21(DE3) by using 
the leader sequence of the phoA gene, a strong stationary-phase promoter for the 
kil gene and supplementation of the medium by glycine. Using a stationary-phase
promoter for the expression of streptavidin had a negative effect.
