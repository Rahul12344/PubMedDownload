This study evaluated the effects of Angelica sinensis extract [Dang Gui (DG)]
administered before 60[Formula: see text]min of middle cerebral artery occlusion 
followed by 3[Formula: see text]d of reperfusion and investigated the involvement
of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF)-1[Formula: see text] signaling in the cortical ischemic penumbra. DG was
intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 0.25[Formula: see text]g/kg
(DG-0.25g), 0.5[Formula: see text]g/kg (DG-0.5g), or 1[Formula: see text]g/kg
(DG-1g) 30[Formula: see text]min before the onset of cerebral ischemia. Our study
results revealed that DG-0.5g and DG-1g pretreatment effectively attenuated
cerebral infarct and improved neurological deficits. DG-0.5g and DG-1g
pretreatment significantly downregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3 expression and upregulated phospho-p38 MAPK
(p-p38 MAPK)/p38 MAPK, phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein
(p-CREB)/CREB, cytosolic and mitochondrial phospho-Bad (p-Bad)/Bad ratios, and
HIF-1[Formula: see text], vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A),
phospho-90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p-p90RSK), and von Willebrand factor (vWF)
expression in the cortical ischemic penumbra. Pretreatment with SB203580, a p38
MAPK inhibitor, dramatically abrogated the upregulating effects of DG-1g on p-p38
MAPK/p38 MAPK, p-CREB/CREB, and p-Bad/Bad ratios and HIF-1[Formula: see text],
VEGF-A, and vWF expression and the downregulating effects of DG-1g on GFAP,
cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, and cerebral infarction. DG-0.5g and DG-1g
pretreatment provided neuroprotective effects against astrocyte-mediated cerebral
infarction by activating angiogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling. Moreover, the
angiogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of DG pretreatment can be attributed to the
activation of p38 MAPK/HIF-1[Formula: see text]/VEGF-A/vWF signaling and p38
MAPK/HIF-1[Formula: see text]/VEGF-A/p-Bad-related regulation of cytochrome
c/caspase-3 signaling, respectively, in the cortical ischemic penumbra 3[Formula:
see text]d after reperfusion.
