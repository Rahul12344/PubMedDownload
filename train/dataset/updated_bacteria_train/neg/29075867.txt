The mycolic acid layer and S-layer of Corynebacterium glutamicum have been
considered as permeability barriers against lytic agents. EGTA, a calcium
chelator, inhibited C. glutamicum growth at relatively lower concentrations
compared with other Gram-positive bacteria. We investigated the effect of EGTA on
C. glutamicum cell surface structures. Simultaneous addition of EGTA and lysozyme
resulted in cell lysis, whereas addition of these reagents separately had no such
effect. Analysis of cell surface proteins showed that CspB, an S-layer protein,
was released into the culture media and degraded to several sizes upon EGTA
treatment. These findings suggest that EGTA treatment causes release and
proteolysis of the CspB protein, resulting in increased cell surface
permeability. FE-SEM visualization further confirmed alteration of cell surface
structures in EGTA-treated cells. This is the first report suggesting the
importance of calcium ions in cell surface integrity of C. glutamicum.
