The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of coronary artery
disease (CAD) has been increasingly discussed, but still remains unclear.
Inflammatory changes in the vessel wall play an important role in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Systemic inflammatory reaction can be detected
by showing increased plasma levels of different proinflammatory cytokines and
acute-phase proteins. Infectious agents have been linked to coronary heart
disease on epidemiological and pathogenetic grounds. The prevalent condition and 
the exact mechanism of initiation of atherosclerotic vascular disease remain
unclear. Nevertheless, many similarities exist between the processes of
inflammation and atherogenesis, and the evidence is growing for the role of an
active inflammation in the atherosclerosis in the coronary circulation and
elsewhere. Although the seroepidemiological and eradication studies have
suggested a causal relationship between Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and
coronary heart disease; the issue is still controversial. The detection of Hp
specific DNA in atheromatous plaque material from coronary arteries, but more
important, the reduction in restenosis of coronary vessels after Hp eradication
could be interpreted as an evidence for the involvement of a Hp infection in the 
progression of CAD induced by a local inflammatory process.
