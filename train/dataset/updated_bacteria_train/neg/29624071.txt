Rationale: Contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) constitute an important
target population for preventive measures because they are at high risk of
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and progression to disease.Objectives: 
We investigated biosignatures with predictive ability for incident TB.Methods: In
a case-control study nested within the Grand Challenges 6-74 longitudinal
HIV-negative African cohort of exposed household contacts, we employed RNA
sequencing, PCR, and the pair ratio algorithm in a training/test set approach.
Overall, 79 progressors who developed TB between 3 and 24 months after diagnosis 
of index case and 328 matched nonprogressors who remained healthy during 24
months of follow-up were investigated.Measurements and Main Results: A
four-transcript signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian
training set predicted progression up to two years before onset of disease in
blinded test set samples from South Africa, the Gambia, and Ethiopia with little 
population-associated variability, and it was also validated in an external
cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection. By
contrast, published diagnostic or prognostic TB signatures were predicted in
samples from some but not all three countries, indicating site-specific
variability. Post hoc meta-analysis identified a single gene pair, C1QC/TRAV27
(complement C1q C-chain / T-cell receptor-Î± variable gene 27) that would
consistently predict TB progression in household contacts from multiple African
sites but not in infected adolescents without known recent exposure
events.Conclusions: Collectively, we developed a simple whole blood-based PCR
test to predict TB in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African
populations. This test has potential for implementation in national TB contact
investigation programs.
