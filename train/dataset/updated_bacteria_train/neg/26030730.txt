Serine phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that regulates
diverse biological processes. Powerful analytical methods have identified
thousands of phosphorylation sites, but many of their functions remain to be
deciphered. A key to understanding the function of protein phosphorylation is
access to phosphorylated proteins, but this is often challenging or impossible.
Here we evolve an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair that directs 
the efficient incorporation of phosphoserine (pSer (1)) into recombinant proteins
in Escherichia coli. Moreover, combining the orthogonal pair with a metabolically
engineered E. coli enables the site-specific incorporation of a nonhydrolyzable
analog of pSer. Our approach enables quantitative decoding of the amber stop
codon as pSer, and we purify, with yields of several milligrams per liter of
culture, proteins bearing biologically relevant phosphorylations that were
previously challenging or impossible to access--including phosphorylated
ubiquitin and the kinase Nek7, which is synthetically activated by a genetically 
encoded phosphorylation in its activation loop.
