The incidence of systemic mycoses was investigated in the autopsy material of the
Institute of Pathology of the Humaine Hospital in Bad Saarow, Germany. This
hospital provides qualified standard care in east Brandenburg with a wide
spectrum of medical disciplines caring for patients with acute medical conditions
as well as oncological cases (660 beds). Between 1973 and 2001, 47 systemic
mycoses were diagnosed in 4813 autopsies of deceased adults, corresponding to
0.98%. During the period of investigation, both the care provided by the hospital
and the organization of the health service changed. The autopsy frequency fell
from about 80% (1973-1991) to about 28% (1992-2001). This is thus still far
higher than the average of about 3% assumed for the Federal Republic of Germany. 
Although the incidence of systemic mycoses increased during the entire 29-year
period of investigation, the number of cases in whom this was the immediate cause
of death decreased. Whereas candidoses predominated from 1973 to 1991, a shift in
favor of aspergilloses was noticed in the period from 1992 to 2001. Systemic
mycosis was diagnosed intravitally in only three of 47 cases. The present study
therefore underscores the significance of clinical autopsy as a diagnostic method
and means of medical quality control.
