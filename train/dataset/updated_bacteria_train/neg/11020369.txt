This study was carried out in order to try to establish an efficacious and
reliable experimental infection model for Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the
causative agent of rainbow trout fry syndrome, using contact, oral and anal
challenges. Ten F psychrophilum strains of different origin were included. The
influence of water temperature, scarification, water quality, stress and growth
conditions of the pathogen on the experimental infection was assessed. For each
challenge protocol, all strains failed to reproduce disease signs or mortality in
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss L.) fry. Histological and bacteriological
examination of the skin, gills and internal organs of the fish 3 weeks following 
inoculation were found to be negative. Different hypotheses to explain the
inability of the challenge models to reproduce the disease experimentally are
discussed.
