In this study, the effect of microalgal strains on the formation of
algal-bacterial biofloc was investigated in liquid digestate pretreated by a
sequencing batch reactor (SBR), which loaded much aerobic bacteria from activated
sludge. Six microalgal strains resulted in three cases: no-bioflocculation
(Scenedesmus obliquus and Botryococcus braunii), optimal-bioflocculation with
high flocculation activity and good growth (Chlorella sp. BWY-1, Haematococcus
pluvialis and Dictyosphaerium ehnenbergianum) and over-bioflocculation with high 
flocculation activity and bad growth (Chlorella vulgaris). Chlorella sp. BWY-1
provided a better level of flocculation activity and growth. Polysaccharides and 
proteins were present in EPS of algal-bacterial biofloc, and their distribution
was confirmed by staining with alcian blue and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC).
