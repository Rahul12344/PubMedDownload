A new murine homeo-box, called Hox-1.7, has been identified in a rare cDNA from
F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells. The Hox-1.7 homeo-box is 68 and 72% homologous to 
the Drosophila antennapedia (Antp) and iab-7 homeo-boxes, respectively. A major
2.5-kilobase transcript and several minor transcripts were detected by Northern
blot (RNA blot) analysis in adult tissues as well as in midgestational embryos.
The posterior spinal cord was found to be a major site of Hox-1.7 expression in
12.5-day-old embryos. Somatic cell hybrids were used to map the Hox-1.7 gene to
mouse chromosome 6. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with
either the Hox-1.7 gene or the previously known Hox-1 complex were identified.
Their distribution patterns in recombinant inbred mouse strains were used to
determine the linkage between the two loci as well as to other loci on chromosome
6. This maps Hox-1 and Hox-1.7 close to two mouse loci that affect morphogenesis,
postaxial hemimelia (px) and hypodactyly (Hd).
