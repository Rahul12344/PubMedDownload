Infection of murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages with viable Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB) H37Ra inhibited surface expression of MHC class II (MHC-II)
molecules and processing of exogenous antigens for presentation to CD4(+) T
hybridoma cells. The inhibition was not dependent on bacterial viability, since
it was also produced by exposure to dead bacilli and MTB cytosol preparations,
suggesting that it was initiated by a constitutively expressed bacterial
component. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that MTB bacilli or cytosol
decreased MHC-II mRNA, and immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled
molecules confirmed that MHC-II protein synthesis was diminished. Exposure to MTB
or MTB cytosol also decreased expression of H2-DM, but H2-DM expression was still
sufficient to catalyze conversion of MHC-II to SDS-stable dimers, a measure of
MHC-II peptide loading. Thus, infection with MTB decreased both MHC-II and H2-DM 
expression, but diminished MHC-II synthesis provided the major limitation to
antigen processing.
