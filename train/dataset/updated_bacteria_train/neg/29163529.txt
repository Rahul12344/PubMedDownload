NLRP10 is a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor that
functions as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor for microbial
products. Here, we generated a Nlrp10-/- mouse to delineate the role of NLRP10 in
the host immune response and found that Nlrp10-/- dendritic cells (DCs) elicited 
sub-optimal IFNγ production by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells compared to
wild-type (WT) DCs. In response to T-cell encounter, CD40 ligation or Toll-like
receptor 9 stimulation, Nlrp10-/- DCs produced low levels of IL-12, due to a
substantial decrease in NF-κB activation. Defective IL-12 production was also
evident in vivo and affected IFNγ production by CD4+ T cells. Upon Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, Nlrp10-/- mice displayed diminished T helper 1-cell
responses and increased bacterial growth compared to WT mice. These data indicate
that NLRP10-mediated IL-12 production by DCs is critical for IFNγ induction in T 
cells and contributes to promote the host defense against Mtb.
