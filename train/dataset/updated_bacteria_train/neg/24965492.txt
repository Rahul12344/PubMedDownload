This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of
dietary vitamin C on some skin mucus immune parameters, mucus antimicrobial
activity and growth performance of Caspian roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) fry. 
Six hundred sixty Caspian roach (1.4 Â± 0.02 g) fry were allocated to 12 tanks (55
fish per tank), and triplicate groups were fed diets containing 0, 1,000, 1,500
and 2,000 mg kg(-1) vitamin C for 60 days. At the end of the trial, the epidermal
mucus protein level, alkaline phosphatase and antimicrobial activity against two 
gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus faecium and Micrococcus luteus) and
gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens) as well as
growth performance were measured. The results demonstrated that feeding on
vitamin C significantly elevated skin mucus alkaline phosphatase and protein
levels compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, lysozyme activity was
undetectable in both the vitamin C-fed roach fry and the control group. Skin
mucus antimicrobial activity was increased following vitamin C administration,
and the bacterial growth inhibition zones were significantly elevated in vitamin 
C-fed roach (P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in case of the minimum
inhibitory concentration of skin mucus. Also fish fed the control diet had a
significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and condition factor
compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). These results revealed that dietary 
vitamin C beneficially affects the skin mucus immune parameters and growth
performance of Caspian roach fry.
