The mass spectral signatures of airborne bacteria were measured and analyzed in
cloud simulation experiments at the AIDA (Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the
Atmosphere) facility. Suspensions of cultured cells in pure water were sprayed
into the aerosol and cloud chambers forming an aerosol which consisted of intact 
cells, cell fragments and residual particles from the agar medium in which the
bacteria were cultured. The aerosol particles were analyzed with a
high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer equipped with a newly
developed PM2.5 aerodynamic lens. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) using the
multilinear engine (ME-2) source apportionment was applied to deconvolve the
bacteria and agar mass spectral signatures. The bacteria mass fraction
contributed between 75 and 95% depending on the aerosol generation, with the
remaining mass attributed to agar. We present mass spectra of Pseudomonas
syringae and Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria typical for ice-nucleation active
bacteria in the atmosphere to facilitate the distinction of airborne bacteria
from other constituents in ambient aerosol, e.g. by PMF/ME-2 source apportionment
analyses. Nitrogen-containing ions were the most salient feature of the bacteria 
mass spectra, and a combination of C4 H8 N(+) (m/z 70) and C5 H12 N(+) (m/z 86)
may be used as marker ions.
