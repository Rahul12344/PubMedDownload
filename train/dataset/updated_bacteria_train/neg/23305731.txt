Neutrophils have been reported to acquire surface expression of MHC class II and 
co-stimulatory molecules as well as T-cell stimulatory activities when cultured
with selected cytokines. However, cellular identity of those unusual neutrophils 
showing antigen presenting cell (APC)-like features still remains elusive. Here
we show that both immature and mature neutrophils purified from mouse bone marrow
differentiate into a previously unrecognized "hybrid" population showing dual
properties of both neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs) when cultured with
granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor but not with other tested growth
factors. The resulting hybrid cells express markers of both neutrophils (Ly6G,
CXCR2, and 7/4) and DCs (CD11c, MHC II, CD80, and CD86). They also exhibit
several properties typically reserved for DCs, including dendritic morphology,
probing motion, podosome formation, production of interleukin-12 and other
cytokines, and presentation of various forms of foreign protein antigens to na√Øve
CD4 T cells. Importantly, they retain intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to
capture exogenous material, extrude neutrophil extracellular traps, and kill
bacteria via cathelicidin production. Not only do our results reinforce the
notion that neutrophils can acquire APC-like properties, they also unveil a
unique differentiation pathway of neutrophils into neutrophil-DC hybrids that can
participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses.
