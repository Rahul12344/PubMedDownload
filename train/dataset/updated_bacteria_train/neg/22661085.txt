IL-33 is known to play an important role in Th2 immunity. In this study, we
investigated the effect of IL-33 pretreatment on anti-fungal response using an
acute Candida albicans peritoneal infection model. IL-33 pretreatment induced a
rapid fungal clearance and markedly reduced the C. albicans infection-associated 
mortality. The priming effect of IL-33 occurred during multiple steps of the
neutrophil-mediated anti-fungal response. First, the anti-fungal effect occurred 
due to the rapid and massive recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection 
as a result of the release of CXCR2 chemokines by peritoneal macrophages and by
reversal of the TLR-induced reduction of CXCR2 expression in neutrophils during
IL-33 priming. Second, conditioning of neutrophils by IL-33 activated the TLR and
dectin-1 signaling pathways, leading to the upregulation of complement receptor 3
expression induced by C. albicans. Upregulated CR3 in turn increased the
phagocytosis of opsonized C. albicans and resulted in the production of high
levels of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent enhanced killing activity of
neutrophils. Taken together, our results suggest that IL-33 can regulate the
anti-fungal activity of neutrophils by collaborative modulation of the signaling 
pathways of different classes of innate immune receptors.
