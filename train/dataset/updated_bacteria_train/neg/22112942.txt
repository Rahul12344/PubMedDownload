Streptavidin was expressed on the outer membrane of E. coli as a recombinant
fusion protein with an autotransporter domain called AIDA-I (adhesin involved in 
diffuse adherence) using autodisplay technology. The autodisplay of streptavidin 
was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of the outer membrane proteins, and the number of
autodisplayed streptavidin molecules on a single E. coli cell was evaluated with 
densitometric analysis. The biotin-binding activity of the autodisplayed
streptavidin was estimated after treatment with fluorescently labeled biotin by
fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The biotin-binding activity of the E.
coli with autodisplayed streptavidin was compared with the activity of
streptavidin immobilized on magnetic beads. Finally, the outer membrane
presenting autodisplayed streptavidin was isolated and layered on a 96-well
microplate for an immunoassay.
