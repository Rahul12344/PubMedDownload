BACKGROUND/AIMS: IGF-1 can act as an endocrine hormone and its signaling server
as essential roles in regulating tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms in IGF-1 have been 
reported associated bad prognosis of with human cancer, but their association
with the risk of human gastric cancer (GC) has not been found so far. In this
study rs6218 located in the 3'UTR of IGF-1 was selected to evaluate its
relationship with the risk of GC among Chinese population.
METHODS: Questionnaire, SNaPshot genotype assay, real time PCR assay, cell
transfection and the dual luciferase reporter assay were used in our study.
RESULTS: SNP rs6218 in IGF-1 3'-UTR was involved in the occurrence of GC by
acting as a tumor promotion factor while rs6128 acting as a risk factor. SNP
rs6128 was also could be regulated by miR-603 which caused an up-regulation of
IGF-1 in patients with UC and CC genotype. Furthermore, the carriers of UC and CC
genotype presented a big tumor size as well as the high probability of
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings have shown that the SNP rs6218 in IGF-1
3'-UTR, through disrupting the regulatory role of miR-603 in IGF-1 expression,
rs16128 in IGF-1 might act as a promotion factor in the pathogenesis of GC.
