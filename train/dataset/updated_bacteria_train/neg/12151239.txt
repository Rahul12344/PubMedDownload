The IncHI2 plasmid R478, like other arsenic resistance IncH plasmids, provides
increased levels of resistance to sodium arsenate (up to 100mM) and sodium
arsenite (up to 10mM) to the host cell. An arsenic resistance fragment of R478
was cloned and sequenced revealing four arsenic resistance associated gene
homologues, arsR, arsB, arsC, and arsH. Two other open reading frames in the
cloned fragment were found to be homologues of sulphate transport associated
genes. Both the four gene arsenic resistance operons and the two gene sulphate
transport operons have been previously shown to be transposon associated.
However, no evidence of transposability was found associated with these operons
in R478. Both the R478 associated arsenic and sulphate transport operons were
shown to be common to all arsenic resistance IncH plasmids examined by Southern
hybridisation and PCR analysis.
