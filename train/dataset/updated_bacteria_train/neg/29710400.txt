In September 2014, a freshwater oomycete was first isolated from Asian Seabass
Lates calcarifer fry that were reared in freshwater at a fish hatchery in Sabah, 
Malaysia. A fungal strain was isolated from infected fry by using glucose yeast
extract (GY) agar. From morphological identification, the strain belonged to the 
genus Achlya based on the mode of zoospore release. Molecular phylogenetic
analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region sequences from the strain
showed high similarity (99-100%) to Achlya oblongata. The isolate was able to
grow on GY agar incubated at 15-35°C, in GY broth adjusted to pH 3.0-11.0, and in
up to 1.0% NaCl. This is the first report of Achlya infection in
freshwater-reared Asian Seabass in Malaysia.
