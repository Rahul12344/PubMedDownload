In 2013, raw pork was the suspected vehicle of a large outbreak (n = 203 cases)
of Salmonella Muenchen in the German federal state of Saxony. In 2014, we
investigated an outbreak (n = 247 cases) caused by the same serovar affecting
Saxony and three further federal states in the eastern part of Germany. Evidence 
from epidemiological, microbiological and trace-back investigations strongly
implicated different raw pork products as outbreak vehicles. Trace-back analysis 
of S. Muenchen-contaminated raw pork sausages narrowed the possible source down
to 54 pig farms, and S. Muenchen was detected in three of them, which traded
animals with each other. One of these farms had already been the suspected source
of the 2013 outbreak. S. Muenchen isolates from stool of patients in 2013 and
2014 as well as from food and environmental surface swabs of the three pig farms 
shared indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Our results
indicate a common source of both outbreaks in the primary production of pigs.
Current European regulations do not make provisions for Salmonella control
measures on pig farms that have been involved in human disease outbreaks. In
order to prevent future outbreaks, legislators should consider tightening
regulations for Salmonella control in causative primary production settings.
