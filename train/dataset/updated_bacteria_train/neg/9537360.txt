The Bacillus subtilis skin element confers resistance to arsenate and arsenite.
The ars operon in the skin element contains four genes in the order arsR, ORF2,
arsB, and arsC. Three of these genes are homologous to the arsR, arsB, and arsC
genes from the staphylococcal plasmid pI258, while no homologs of ORF2 have been 
found. Inactivation of arsR, arsB, or arsC results in either constitutive
expression of ars, an arsenite- and arsenate-sensitive phenotype, or an
arsenate-sensitive phenotype, respectively. These results suggest that ArsR,
ArsB, and ArsC function as a negative regulator, a membrane-associated protein
need for extrusion of arsenite, and arsenate reductase, respectively. Expression 
of the ars operon was induced by arsenate, arsenite, and antimonite. Northern
hybridization and primer extension analysis showed that synthesis of a
full-length ars transcript of about 2.4 kb was induced by arsenate and that the
ars promoter contains sequences that resemble the -10 and -35 regions of
promoters that are recognized by E sigmaA.
