Rbfox proteins control alternative splicing and posttranscriptional regulation in
mammalian brain and are implicated in neurological disease. These proteins
recognize the RNA sequence (U)GCAUG, but their structures and diverse roles imply
a variety of protein-protein interactions. We find that nuclear Rbfox proteins
are bound within a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), a multimeric
complex containing the proteins hnRNP M, hnRNP H, hnRNP C, Matrin3, NF110/NFAR-2,
NF45, and DDX5, all approximately equimolar to Rbfox. We show that splicing
repression mediated by hnRNP M is stimulated by Rbfox. Virtually all the
intron-bound Rbfox is associated with LASR, and hnRNP M motifs are enriched
adjacent to Rbfox crosslinking sites in vivo. These findings demonstrate that
Rbfox proteins bind RNA with a defined set of cofactors and affect a broader set 
of exons than previously recognized. The function of this multimeric LASR complex
has implications for deciphering the regulatory codes controlling splicing
networks.
