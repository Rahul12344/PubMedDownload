A 33-year-old man with a known bicuspid aortic valve presented with fever,
chills, progressive fatigue, anorexia, and night sweats. Echocardiography
confirmed aortic-valve endocarditis, but blood cultures remained negative.
Bartonella henselae endocarditis was ultimately confirmed by serology as well as 
by immunohistochemistry and PCR testing of the excised valve. The patient
recovered with appropriate antibiotic therapy. B henselae is a common cause of
culture-negative endocarditis. It predominantly affects men with underlying
valvular disease, and has a predilection for aortic valves. Diagnosis is usually 
made serologically and with either tissue culture, immunohistochemistry, or PCR. 
Treatment of this destructive endocarditis consists of a combination of long-term
antibiotic therapy and surgical valve repair. This case is used to discuss the
approach towards the treatment of patients with endocarditis that is
blood-culture negative.
