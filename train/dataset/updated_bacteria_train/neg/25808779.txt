The infection of plants by hemibiotrophic pathogens involves a complex and highly
regulated transition from an initial biotrophic, asymptomatic stage to a later
necrotrophic state, characterized by cell death. Little is known about how this
transition is regulated, and there are conflicting views regarding the
significance of the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) in 
the different phases of infection. To provide a broad view of the hemibiotrophic 
infection process from the plant perspective, we surveyed the transcriptome of
tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) during a compatible interaction with the
hemibiotrophic oomycete Phytophthora infestans during three infection stages:
biotrophic, the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy, and the necrotrophic
phase. Nearly 10 000 genes corresponding to proteins in approximately 400
biochemical pathways showed differential transcript abundance during the three
infection stages, revealing a major reorganization of plant metabolism, including
major changes in source-sink relations, as well as secondary metabolites. In
addition, more than 100 putative resistance genes and pattern recognition
receptor genes were induced, and both JA and SA levels and associated signalling 
pathways showed dynamic changes during the infection time course. The biotrophic 
phase was characterized by the induction of many defence systems, which were
either insufficient, evaded or suppressed by the pathogen.
