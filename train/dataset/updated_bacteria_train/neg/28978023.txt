The significance of mucins in cancers has led to the development of novel
biomarkers and therapeutic agents against cancers. Despite significant advances
in the understanding of mucins, systemic investigations into the role of mucins
in cancer biology focusing particularly on the histological subtypes and stages, 
along with other variables, are yet to be carried out to discover potential novel
functions and cancer-specific roles. Here, we investigated 11 mucin expressing
cancers for DNA mutations, mRNA expression, copy number, methylation, and the
impacts these genomic features may have on patient survival by utilizing The
Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. We demonstrate that mucin DNA mutations have a
significant rate, pattern, and impact on cancer patient survival depending on the
tissue of origin. This includes a frequent T112P mutation in MUC1 that is seen in
half of the pancreatic MUC1 mutations, as well as being present in other cancers.
We also observed a very frequent MUC4 mutation at H4205, which correlated with
survival outcomes in patients. Furthermore, we observed significant alterations
in mucin mRNA expression in multiple tumor types. Our results demonstrate de novo
expression of certain mucins in cancer tissues, including MUC21 in colorectal
cancers. We observed a general decrease in promoter methylation for mucins, which
correlated with decreased expression of many genes, such as MUC15 in kidney
cancers. Lastly, several mucin gene loci demonstrated copy number increase in
multiple histological subtypes. Thus, our study presents a comprehensive analysis
of genomic alterations in mucins and their corresponding roles in cancer
progression.
