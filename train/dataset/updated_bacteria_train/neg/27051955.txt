OBJECTIVE: This study measures the glutaredoxin (Grx) gene and protein expression
in umbilical vein endothelial cells upon exposure to Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.
gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The involvement of the Akt-signaling
pathway is also determined.
METHODS: EA-hy926 cells were pretreated with 1,000 ng · mL⁻¹ P. gingivalis LPS
for 4, 12, 18, and 24 h, and then real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction was employed to detect Grx1 expression. The effect of Grx on Akt
activity was investigated using Western blot for the control, LPS (1,000 ng ·
mL⁻¹ LPS), and carmus- tine (BCNU) groups (1,000 ng · mL⁻¹ LPS, and the EA-hy926 
cells were pretreated with 25 μmol · ml⁻¹ BCNU for 30 min).
RESULTS: Gene expression of Grx1 significantly increased in LPS group compared
with that in the control group. The Grx1 expression reached the peak level in 12 
h, and the variation between the expression in 4 and 12 h was significant (P <
0.05). After 12 h, the protein levels of Grx and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt)
significantly increased in the LPS group (P < 0.05), whereas the BCNU group
showed a considerable decrease in both Grx and p-Akt expression levels (P <
0.05). Moreover, a slight difference was observed in the total Akt protein levels
in the three groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Grx expression increased upon exposure of EA-hy926 cells to the LPS. 
Akt activity could be inhibited by BCNU (a Grx inhibitor), which indicated that
Akt might act as a downstream regulator of Grx.
