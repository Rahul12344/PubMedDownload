Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira
interrogans. The organism is typically maintained within a geographic region by
colonizing renal tubules of carrier animals and shed into the environment in
urine. We assessed whether L. interrogans was present in fox squirrels (Sciurus
niger) in Larimer County, Colorado, USA, and whether it is associated with
disease. Twenty-two squirrels were trapped from 29 November 2011 to 15 December
2011 for use in an unrelated study. The squirrels were individually housed for
33-65 days and euthanized; no clinical disease was observed. On gross
examination, significant renal lesions were observed in 6 of 22 animals (27%).
Histologically, affected animals had severe neutrophilic tubulitis with
interstitial nephritis. Immunohistochemistry was conducted on the kidneys of all 
animals and 10 of 22 (45%) were positive for L. interrogans, with varying
severity of infection. The same 10 squirrels were serologically positive for
antibodies specific to L. interrogans. These results suggest that L. interrogans 
is present in fox squirrels in Larimer County, Colorado, USA, and may be
associated with varying degrees of renal disease. Further investigation into the 
role of wildlife in the ecology of leptospirosis within the region is warranted.
