SLX4, a coordinator of multiple DNA structure-specific endonucleases, is
important for several DNA repair pathways. Noncovalent interactions of SLX4 with 
ubiquitin are required for localizing SLX4 to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), 
yet how SLX4 is targeted to other functional contexts remains unclear. Here, we
show that SLX4 binds SUMO-2/3 chains via SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). The SIMs
of SLX4 are dispensable for ICL repair but important for processing CPT-induced
replication intermediates, suppressing fragile site instability, and localizing
SLX4 to ALT telomeres. The localization of SLX4 to laser-induced DNA damage also 
requires the SIMs, as well as DNA end resection, UBC9, and MDC1. Furthermore, the
SUMO binding of SLX4 enhances its interaction with specific DNA-damage sensors or
telomere-binding proteins, including RPA, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1, and TRF2. Thus, the
interactions of SLX4 with SUMO and ubiquitin increase its affinity for factors
recognizing different DNA lesions or telomeres, helping to direct the SLX4
complex in distinct functional contexts.
