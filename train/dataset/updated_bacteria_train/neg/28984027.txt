OBJECTIVE: To evaluate oral hygiene habits, decayed, missing and filled teeth
(DMFT) and surfaces (DMFS), dental care, dietetic habits and anti-Streptococcus
mutans salivary secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in young adults who attended a 
preventive programme during preschool age.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group (Baby Clinic) comprised 72 patients, aged
18-25 years, who had participated in the Baby Clinic preventive programme. The
control group was age- and gender-matched. The patients were examined and
unstimulated whole saliva was sampled for detection of anti-S. mutansSIgA
antibodies.
RESULTS: Control patients presented increased DMFS scores (P < .05). Hygiene
habits, cariogenic diet and antibody levels were not different between groups
(P > .05). Baby Clinic patients presented better periodontal status (P < .005),
less calculus (P < .005) and bleeding on probing (P < .005), and reported
visiting dental services more regularly (P < .05). Adjusted multivariate linear
regression analysis demonstrated that DMFT was associated with study group
(P < .05), gender (P < .05), parents' education (P < .05), carbohydrate intake
(P < .001) and levels of anti-S. mutansSIgA (P < .007). DMFS was associated with 
time elapsed since the last visit to the dentist (P < .005) and weekly
carbohydrate intake (P < .005).
CONCLUSION: Preventive programmes for preschool children positively impact on
DMFS and periodontal status in young adults, but have no long-term effects on
dietary or hygiene habits.
