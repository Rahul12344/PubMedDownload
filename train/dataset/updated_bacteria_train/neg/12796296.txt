Cytokinesis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a
signaling pathway termed the septation initiation network (SIN). The SIN is
essential for initiation of actomyosin ring constriction and septum formation. In
a screen to search for mutations that can rescue the sid2-250 SIN mutant, we
obtained scw1-18. Both the scw1-18 mutant and the scw1 deletion mutant (scw1Delta
mutant), have defects in cell separation. Both the scw1-18 and scw1Delta
mutations rescue the growth defects of not just the sid2-250 mutant but also the 
other temperature-sensitive SIN mutants. Other cytokinesis mutants, such as those
defective for actomyosin ring formation, are not rescued by scw1Delta. scw1Delta 
does not seem to rescue the SIN by restoring SIN signaling defects. However,
scw1Delta may function downstream of the SIN to promote septum formation, since
scw1Delta can rescue the septum formation defects of the cps1-191beta-1,3-glucan 
synthase mutant, which is required for synthesis of the primary septum.
