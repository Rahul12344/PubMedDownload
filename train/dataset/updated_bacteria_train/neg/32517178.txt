Pseudokinases, comprising 10% of the human kinome, are emerging as regulators of 
canonical kinases and their functions are starting to be defined. We previously
identified the pseudokinase Nuclear Receptor Binding Protein 2 (NRBP2) in a
screen for genes regulated during neural differentiation. During mouse brain
development, NRBP2 is expressed in the cerebellum, and in the adult brain, mainly
confined to specific neuronal populations. To study the role of NRBP2 in brain
tumors, we stained a brain tumor tissue array for NRPB2, and find its expression 
to be low, or absent, in a majority of the tumors. This includes medulloblastoma 
(MB), a pediatric tumor of the cerebellum. Using database mining of published MB 
data sets, we also find that NRBP2 is expressed at a lower level in MB than in
the normal cerebellum. Recent studies indicate that MB exhibits frequent
epigenetic alternations and we therefore treated MB cell lines with drugs
inhibiting DNA methylation or histone deacetylation, which leads to an
upregulation of NRBP2 mRNA expression, showing that it is under epigenetic
regulation in cultured MB cells. Furthermore, forced overexpression of NRBP2 in
MB cell lines causes a dramatic decrease in cell numbers, increased cell death,
impaired cell migration and inhibited cell invasion in vitro. Taken together, our
data indicate that downregulation of NRBP2 may be a feature by which MB cells
escape growth regulation.
