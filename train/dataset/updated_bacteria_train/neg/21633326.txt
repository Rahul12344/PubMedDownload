To cause infections, bacteria must colonize their host. Bacterial pathogens
express various molecules or structures able to promote attachment to host
cells(1). These adhesins rely on interactions with host cell surface receptors or
soluble proteins acting as a bridge between bacteria and host. Adhesion is a
critical first step prior to invasion and/or secretion of toxins, thus it is a
key event to be studied in bacterial pathogenesis. Furthermore, adhered bacteria 
often induce exquisitely fine-tuned cellular responses, the studies of which have
given birth to the field of 'cellular microbiology'(2). Robust assays for
bacterial adhesion on host cells and their invasion therefore play key roles in
bacterial pathogenesis studies and have long been used in many pioneer
laboratories(3,4). These assays are now practiced by most laboratories working on
bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we describe a standard adherence assay illustrating
the contribution of a specific adhesin. We use the Escherichia coli strain
2787(5), a human pathogenic strain expressing the autotransporter Adhesin
Involved in Diffuse Adherence (AIDA). As a control, we use a mutant strain
lacking the aidA gene, 2787Î”aidA (F. Berthiaume and M. Mourez, unpublished), and 
a commercial laboratory strain of E. coli, C600 (New England Biolabs). The
bacteria are left to adhere to the cells from the commonly used HEp-2 human
epithelial cell line. This assay has been less extensively described before(6).
