The implanted venous access catheter is commonly used in the treatment of
oncology patients. Although common long-term complications of these devices, such
as infection and thrombosis, have been widely reported, venous-airway fistula due
to port placement is an extremely rare and poorly understood complication. We
report a case of a 56-year-old woman with pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose
implanted catheter was complicated by the development of an azygo-bronchial
fistula with a concomitant aspergilloma. Herein is the first reported case of
successful venous-airway fistula closure obtained through silicone stenting.
