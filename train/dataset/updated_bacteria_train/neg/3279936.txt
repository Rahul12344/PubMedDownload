To examine the interaction between muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and core body
temperature in murine peritonitis, 120 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to
receive either 0, 1, or 4 micrograms/g body weight of MDP. Twenty-four hours
later a sublethal intraperitoneal inoculation of Escherichia coli was given after
core body temperature regulation at 32 degrees C to 40 degrees C, which was
maintained for 30 minutes. Killing of the rats at 1, 3, or 6 hours later allowed 
evaluation of peritoneal white blood cell and bacterial counts. Results
demonstrated that MDP (independent of core body temperature) caused an increased 
peritoneal white blood cell response at one and six hours and an increased
peritoneal bacterial clearance at three hours. Increasing core body temperature
adversely affected peritoneal bacterial clearance. High-dose MDP was clearly
significant in acceleration of peritoneal bacterial clearance. No interaction
between MDP and core body temperature was seen.
