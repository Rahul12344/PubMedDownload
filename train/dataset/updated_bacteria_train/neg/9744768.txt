A murine monoclonal antibody (MAb F9-16) raised against a porin protein epitope
called Po I of an E. coli 055 strain showed broad cross-reactivity with bacteria 
within the Enterobacteriaceae, and also recognized neisseriae and moraxellae. In 
an immunodot assay, the antibody was bound by 32/33 strains of neisseriae and
moraxellae after SDS treatment of the bacteria. Testing intact bacteria, 11/33
isolates showed definite MAb binding, including serogroup A and B meningococci.
In Western blotting, the anti-Po I MAb targeted the gonococcal porin proteins PIA
and PIB, and class 1, class 2, and class 3 porins of meningococci. The MAb showed
no reactivity against decapeptides which corresponded to the whole length of a
meningococcal class 1 porin protein of the subtype P1, 7, 16. These findings
accord with the inference that enterobacterial, neisserial and moraxellae porin
proteins share an epitope (Po I) which is determined by the three-dimensional
rather than by the primary structure of the proteins and that this epitope is
shielded in most isolates but surface-exposed in some isolates, including some
strains of meningococci. Since Po I is broadly distributed among commensal and
pathogenic bacteria and has demonstrated immunogenicity in humans, this epitope
may play a role in elicitation of "normal" antibodies with immunoprotective
activity.
