Alum-based adjuvants facilitate vaccine-driven humoral immunity, but their
mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that lack of
type II NKT cells is associated with intact, mature B cells but dampened humoral 
immunity following immunization with Alum-adsorbed T-dependent antigen. Type II
NKT cells facilitated production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and antibody by LN 
and splenocyte cultures following Alum/antigen administration in vivo and antigen
restimulation in vitro. Addition of IL-4 and IL-5 to type II NKT-deficient
cultures restored in vitro antibody production. Intracellular staining revealed
that Alum-primed type II NKT cells coordinated IL-4 secretion by T cells. Alum
did not significantly affect CD1d expression in vivo, but addition of
CD1d-blocking mAb diminished cytokine production and in vitro antibody
production. Type II NKT cells therefore function as part of the Alum-sensing
apparatus and in a CD1d-dependent manner, facilitate T(H)2-driven humoral
immunity. This may have important consequences for understanding the mechanism of
action of Alum-containing vaccines.
