Chronic periodontitis (CP) and diabetes mellitus (DM) involve several aspects of 
immune functions, including neutrophil activity and cytokine biology. Considering
the critical function of chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the inflammatory
process, the aims of this study were to determine: (i) IL-8 plasma levels; (ii)
IL-8 (-251A/T, rs4073) and its receptor 2 (CXCR2, +1208C/T, rs1126579)
polymorphisms, and (iii) the presence of the selected periodontal bacteria in
types 1 and 2 DM patients (T1DM and T2DM) and systemically healthy controls (HC) 
with known periodontal status. This case⁻control study comprises of 153 unrelated
individuals: 36/44 patients suffering from T1DM+CP/T2DM+CP and 32/41 from
HC+CP/non-periodontitis HC. Both the clinical and biochemical parameters were
monitored. The genotypes were determined using qPCR, IL-8 plasma levels were
measured using an ELISA kit. Subgingival bacterial colonization was analyzed with
a DNA microarray detection kit. The IL-8 plasma levels differed significantly
between non-periodontitis HC and T1DM+CP/T2DM+CP patients (P < 0.01). Even in
HC+CP, IL-8 concentrations were significantly lower than in T1DM+CP/T2DM+CP
patients (P ≤ 0.05). No significant associations between the IL-8 plasma levels
and the studied IL-8 and CXCR2 polymorphisms or the occurrence of selected
periodontal bacteria (P > 0.05) were found. CP does not influence the circulating
IL-8 levels. Patients with T1DM+CP/T2DM+CP had higher circulating IL-8 levels
than HC+CP/non-periodontitis HC.
