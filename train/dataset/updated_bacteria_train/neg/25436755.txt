MurD enzymes: some recent developments.

Å ink R, Barreteau H, Patin D, Mengin-Lecreulx D, Gobec S, Blanot D.

The synthesis of the peptide stem of bacterial peptidoglycan involves four
enzymes, the Mur ligases (MurC, D, E and F). Among them, MurD is responsible for 
the ATP-dependent addition of d-glutamic acid to UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala, a reaction
which involves acyl-phosphate and tetrahedral intermediates. Like most enzymes of
peptidoglycan biosynthesis, MurD constitutes an attractive target for the design 
and synthesis of new antibacterial agents. Escherichia coli MurD has been the
first Mur ligase for which the tridimensional (3D) structure was solved.
Thereafter, several co-crystal structures with different ligands or inhibitors
were released. In the present review, we will deal with work performed on
substrate specificity, reaction mechanism and 3D structure of E. coli MurD. Then,
a part of the review will be devoted to recent work on MurD orthologs from
species other than E. coli and to cellular organization of Mur ligases and in
vivo regulation of the MurD activity. Finally, we will review the different
classes of MurD inhibitors that have been designed and assayed to date with the
hope of obtaining new antibacterial compounds.
