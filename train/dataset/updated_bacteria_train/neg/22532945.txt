Halitosis (bad breath) is a common condition that is socially crippling for vast 
parts of the population and results from malodorous volatile sulfur compounds,
which are by-products of oral bacteria. In this doubled-blind, randomized study, 
75 subjects with halitosis were evaluated. The participants were treated with or 
without abrasive microcapsules (candy) containing zinc gluconate 0.5%, propolis
2%, and a combination of both (zinc 0.25% and propolis 1%). The halitosis was
assessed by a Halimeter, a portable instrument that measures the emission of
volatile sulfur compounds at different time exposures to the treatments. Breezy
candy (which is sugar-free) was found effective in the treatment of halitosis for
up to 4 hours. While treatment with regular candy (group 1, traditional candy
without abrasive particles) showed reduction in malodor of 10%, Breezy candy
showed reduction of up to 60% in malodor (P < .0001). Since this was not a
longitudinal study, the total duration of the effect was not assessed. Breezy
candy in the abrasive form with zinc additive had the best potential to
positively affect malodor when treating patients with halitosis. The combined
effect of abrasion by microcapsules with zinc supplement represents a novel and
successful approach for the treatment of halitosis.
