BACKGROUND: Perforation peritonitis is the most common surgical emergency. A
large number of microorganisms have been cultured from the abdominal fluid
obtained from patients with gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis. The present
study was undertaken to determine the frequency of positive fungal culture in
perforation peritonitis as Candida co-infection is reported to be a bad
prognostic factor in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraoperative specimens of abdominal fluid collected 
during laparotomy from 140 consecutive patients of gastro-intestinal perforation 
were analysed by microbial culture for bacteria and fungi. Their antimicrobial
susceptibility was also studied.
RESULTS: The mean presenting age of the patients was 35 years and 120 (85.7%) of 
them were males. Aerobic Gram Negative Bacilli (AGNB) were observed in 82 (79.6%)
of the culture positive abdominal fluid specimens, of which 58 (70.7%) were
Escherichia coli. Gram negative bacteria were most frequently isolated from
colorectal perforation (100%) while Gram positive bacteria were from upper
gastrointestinal perforation (47.2%). Candida was cultured in as many as 68 of
140 (48.6%) specimens. Its prevalence was highest in patients with gastroduodenal
perforation (70.5%) and was altogether absent in patients having appendicular
perforation.
CONCLUSION: High prevalence of fungal culture positivity of peritoneal fluid of
patients of perforation peritonitis shows that along with the bacterial culture, 
fungal cultures should always be asked for in such patients. Adequate and timely 
antimicrobial treatment including treatment of fungal infection could help reduce
mortality in this group of patients.
