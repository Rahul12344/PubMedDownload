The gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) is a unique organ inhabited by a range of
commensal microbes, while also being exposed to an overwhelming load of antigens 
in the form of dietary antigens on a daily basis. The GI tract has dual roles in 
the body, in that it performs digestion and uptake of nutrients while also
carrying out the complex and important task of maintaining immune homeostasis,
i.e., keeping the balance between the good and the bad. It is equally important
that we protect ourselves from reacting against the good, meaning that we stay
tolerant to harmless food, commensal bacteria and self-antigens, as well as react
with force against the bad, meaning induction of immune responses against harmful
microorganisms. This complex task is achieved through the presence of a highly
efficient mucosal barrier and a specialized multifaceted immune system, made up
of a large population of scattered immune cells and organized lymphoid tissues
termed the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). This review provides an
overview of the primary components of the human mucosal immune system and how the
immune responses in the GI tract are coordinated and induced.
