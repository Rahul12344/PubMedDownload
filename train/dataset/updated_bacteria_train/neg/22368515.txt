BACKGROUND: Chemokines and their receptors have long been known to regulate
metastasis in various cancers. Previous studies have shown that CXCR2 expression 
is upregulated in malignant breast cancer tissues but not in benign ductal
epithelial samples. The functional role of CXCR2 in the metastatic phenotype of
breast cancer still remains unclear. We hypothesize that the chemokine receptor, 
CXCR2, mediates tumor cell invasion and migration and promotes metastasis in
breast cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential role
of CXCR2 in the metastatic phenotype of mouse mammary tumor cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the functional role of CXCR2 in breast cancer
by stably downregulating the expression of CXCR2 in metastatic mammary tumor cell
lines Cl66 and 4T1, using short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The effects of CXCR2
downregulation on tumor growth, invasion and metastatic potential were analyzed
in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We demonstrated knock down of CXCR2 in Cl66 and 4T1 cells (Cl66-shCXCR2 
and 4T1-shCXCR2) cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) at the transcriptional level and by immunohistochemistry at the protein 
level. We did not observe a significant difference in in vitro cell proliferation
between vector control and CXCR2 knock-down Cl66 or 4T1 cells. Next, we examined 
the invasive potential of Cl66-shCXCR2 cells by in vitro Matrigel invasion assay.
We observed a significantly lower number (52 ± 5) of Cl66-shCXCR2 cells invading 
through Matrigel compared to control cells (Cl66-control) (182 ± 3) (P < 0.05).
We analyzed the in vivo metastatic potential of Cl66-shCXCR2 using a spontaneous 
metastasis model by orthotopically implanting cells into the mammary fat pad of
female BALB/c mice. Animals were sacrificed 12 weeks post tumor implantation and 
tissue samples were analyzed for metastatic nodules. CXCR2 downregulation
significantly inhibited tumor cell metastasis. All the mice (n = 10) implanted
with control Cl66 cells spontaneously developed lung metastasis, whereas a
significantly lower number of mice (40%) implanted with Cl66-shCXCR2 cells
exhibited lung metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that CXCR2 may play a critical role 
in breast cancer invasion and metastasis.
