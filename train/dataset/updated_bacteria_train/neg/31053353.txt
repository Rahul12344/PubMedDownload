In recent years an increasing number of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius
(MRSP) has been observed in both, healthy and clinically infected dogs. The aim
of the study was the characterisation of MRSP isolates from clinical routine
diagnostics of a German laboratory in order to assess the abundancy of resistance
genes and SCCmec elements. 97 isolates from 96 dogs were analysed using
microarrays detecting resistance genes and SCCmec-associated markers. All
isolates harboured mecA and blaZ. Other abundant resistance markers (in >80% of
isolates) included aacA-aphD, aphA3 and sat as well as erm(B). Tetracycline
resistance genes (tet(K), tet(M)) and cat also were common (in >20%). The vast
majority (n = 59) of isolates carried SCCmec III elements. SCCmec IV and V
elements were identified in 21 and 15 isolates, respectively. Irregular or
pseudo-SCCmec elements were found in 2 isolates. The high degree of uniformity of
hybridisation patterns of tested strains suggest that the majority of MRSP
infections was caused by one single strain and comparison to previously published
reports and sequences suggest that this was the ST71-SCCmec III strain that also 
predominates elsewhere in Western Europe.
