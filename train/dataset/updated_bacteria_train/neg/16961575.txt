Posaconazole, a new triazole antifungal, exerts principally the same mechanism of
action as the other azole derivatives, i.e. it inhibits the ergosterol production
by binding and inhibiting the lanosterol-14alpha-demethylase which is present in 
almost all fungi except Pneumocystis and Pythium. Posaconazole has an exquisitely
high affinity to this target. Since posaconazole has a chemical structure
different from fluconazole and voriconazole, it can interact with an additional
domain of the target so that it may inhibit even mutated strains resistant to
fluconazole and voriconazole. In addition posaconazole is a bad substrate for
efflux pumps in fungi, so it can stay active when other azoles are already
inactive. Furthermore, the spectrum of posaconazole is rather large including
also some zygomycetes resistant to other azoles. In conclusion, posaconazole is
actually the most potent azole derivative used in medicine. A combination of
posaconazole with other groups of antifungals may have a favourable effect. There
are several methods to test the in vitro activities of posaconazole including the
E-test, though interpretive breakpoints are still lacking.
