Pharmacological inhibition of RAS, the master regulator of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), continues to be a challenge. Mutations in various isoforms
of RAS gene, including KRAS are known to upregulate CXC chemokines; however,
their precise role in KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this
report, we reveal a previously unidentified tumor cell-autonomous role of
KRAS(G12D)-induced CXCR2 signaling in mediating growth of neoplastic PDAC cells. 
Progressively increasing expression of mCXCR2 and its ligands was detected in the
malignant ductal cells of Pdx1-cre;LSL-Kras(G12D) mice. Knocking-down CXCR2 in
KRAS(G12D)-bearing human pancreatic duct-derived cells demonstrated a significant
decrease in the in vitro and in vivo tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, CXCR2
antagonists showed selective growth inhibition of KRAS(G12D)-bearing cells in
vitro. Intriguingly, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2
signaling in KRAS(G12D)-bearing pancreatic ductal cells reduced the levels of
KRAS protein, strongly implying the presence of a KRAS-CXCR2 feed-forward loop.
Together, these data demonstrate the role of CXCR2 signaling in
KRAS(G12D)-induced growth transformation and progression in PDAC.
