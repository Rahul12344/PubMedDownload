Natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like T lymphocytes that recognize
glycolipid antigens in the context of the MHC class I-related glycoprotein CD1d. 
Recent studies have identified multiple ways in which NKT cells can become
activated during microbial infection. Mechanisms of CD1d-restricted antigen
presentation are being unraveled, and a surprising connection has been made to
proteins that control lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. It appears that
several microorganisms have developed strategies to interfere with the CD1d
antigen-presentation pathway. New studies have also provided important insight
into the mechanisms that control effector cell differentiation of NKT cells and
have revealed specialized functions of distinct NKT cell subsets. Finally, there 
is continued enthusiasm for the development of NKT cell-based therapies of human 
diseases.
