A total of 1002 Escherichia coli strains isolated from pre-weaned pigs with
diarrhoea on 1114 swine farms were screened for the presence of the adhesin
involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA) gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Escherichia coli isolates that carried AIDA genes were also tested by PCR for the
detection of five fimbriae (F4, F5, F6, F18 and F41), heat-stable (STa, STb) and 
heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin, enteroaggregative E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin 1
(EAST1), and Shiga toxin 2 oedema disease (Stx2e) genes. Twenty-three (2.3%) of
the 1002 E. coli isolates carried the gene for AIDA. Among 23 isolates shown to
carry genes for AIDA, three carried the AIDA gene as the only shown virulence
factor. Other isolates carried other virulence factor genes in addition to AIDA. 
Four isolates carried genes for at least one of the fimbrial adhesins and
enterotoxins. Sixteen isolates carried genes for enterotoxins only. The AIDA may 
represent an additional virulence determinant in pre-weaned pigs with diarrhoea.
