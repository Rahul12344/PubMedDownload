OBJECTIVE: The short-term and overnight effect of three treatment regimens on
oral halitosis were investigated: toothbrushing with a reference toothpaste,
toothbrushing with reference toothpaste and tongue cleaning, and toothbrushing
and tongue cleaning with a tooth-and-tongue gel.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: Fifty-four subjects meeting the inclusion criteria for bad 
breath were enrolled in the study. All subjects received each of the three
treatment regimens in a balanced design. Efficacy was assessed by organoleptic
ratings and volatile sulfur compound (VSC) measurements 5 and 60 minutes after
first application and overnight after 7 days of repeated use.
RESULTS: The combination of toothbrushing and tongue cleaning with
tooth-and-tongue gel provided the best results in terms of organoleptic ratings
and VSC measurements at all time points compared to the other treatment regimens.
CONCLUSION: The use of tooth and tongue gel for both toothbrushing and tongue
cleaning showed a positive short-term and overnight effects after 7 days of use. 
This treatment regimen is a promising approach to control halitosis.
