Baicalein (BAI) is a natural flavonoid. It has been shown that BAI has anticancer
effects, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. The aim of the current
study was to confirm whether or not BAI triggers autophagy and induces AMPK
activation in glioma U251 cells. The Ad-mcherry-GFP-LC3B adenovirus experiments
indicated that BAI induces glioma cell autophagy. Western blotting showed that
the level of LC3II expression increased with the time and concentration of BAI.
Following treatment with chloroquine, the expression of LC3 was enhanced
Immunofluorescence also confirmed this result. At the same time, cleaved
caspase-3, DAPI staining, and JC-1 staining revealed that apoptosis was also
induced in the induction of autophagy. In addition, we found that BAI activates
phosphorylation of AMPK, which is further confirmed using compound C in this
process. When the phosphorylation of AMPK was inhibited, autophagy, and apoptosis
were also inhibited. In conclusion, BAI induces autophagy and apoptosis through
AMPK pathway. Surprisingly, our research provides new insight with the function
of anticancer of BAI, and the potential of the promotion in glioma cell apoptosis
might be related to autophagy activation. These results demonstrate the
anticancer activity of BAI, which can be used as potential therapeutic agents for
cancer therapy.
