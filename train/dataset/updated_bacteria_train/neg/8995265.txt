The arsenical resistance (ars) operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 confers
resistance to arsenical and antimonial compounds in Escherichia coli, where
resistance results from active extrusion of arsenite catalyzed by the products of
the arsA and arsB genes. Previous in vivo studies on the energetics of arsenite
extrusion showed that expression of both genes produced an ATP-coupled arsenite
extrusion system that was independent of the electrochemical proton gradient. In 
contrast, in cells expressing only the arsB gene, arsenite extrusion was coupled 
to electrochemical energy and independent of ATP, suggesting that the Ars
transport system exhibits a dual mode of energy coupling depending on the subunit
composition. In vitro the ArsA-ArsB complex has been shown to catalyze
ATP-coupled uptake of 73AsO2(-1) in everted membrane vesicles. However, transport
catalyzed by ArsB alone has not previously been observed in vitro. In this study 
we demonstrate everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing only arsB
exhibit uptake of 73AsO2(-1) coupled to electrochemical energy.
