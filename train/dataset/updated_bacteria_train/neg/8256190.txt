Postoperative pneumonia in the surgical patient may occur from atelectasis and
inadequate postoperative TV, from ventilator-associated pathophysiology and from 
aspiration. Each process ultimately elicits the proinflammatory responses from
the lung in the effort to eradicate the infectious pathogens. Postoperative
pneumonia is best prevented by maintaining a clear understanding of the biologic 
basis for infection in the lung. Therapy requires aggressive tracheobronchial
drainage strategies and antibiotic therapy directed toward the pathogens that are
producing the pulmonary inflammatory response.
