Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 3%-5% of the U.S. population, having 
severe clinical complications to the development of fibrosis and end-stage liver 
diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A critical cause of
NASH is chronic systemic inflammation promoted by innate immune cells, such as
liver macrophages (Mϕ) and natural killer (NK) cells. However, little is known
about how the crosstalk between Mϕ and NK cells contributes to regulate NASH
progression to fibrosis. In this report, we demonstrate that NKp46(+) cells play 
an important role in preventing NASH progression to fibrosis by regulating M1/M2 
polarization of liver Mϕ. Using a murine model of NASH, we demonstrate that
DX5(+)NKp46(+) NK cells are increased during disease and play a role in
polarizing Mϕ toward M1-like phenotypes. This NK's immunoregulatory function
depends on the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), but not by
granzyme-mediated cytolytic activity. Notably, depletion of NKp46(+) cells
promotes the development of fibrosis with increased expression of profibrogenic
genes as well as skewed M2 Mϕ phenotypes in hepatic tissues.CONCLUSIONS: NK
cell-derived IFN-γ may be essential for maintaining a balanced inflammatory
environment that promotes tissue integrity and limiting NASH progression to
fibrosis.
