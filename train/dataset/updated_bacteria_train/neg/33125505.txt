BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDRGN) pose an emerging
threat in German hospitals and in the outpatient sector. However, only few
studies have investigated the prevalence of MDRGN in nonhospital settings and the
associated risk factors for colonization.
OBJECTIVE: In our study we determined the prevalence of MDRGN in inhabitants of
long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and associated risk factors for colonization in
the region Weimar, Weimarer Land, and Jena.
METHODS: Between May and August 2019, deep rectal swabs were taken from 307
inhabitants of 13 facilities and examined microbiologically for the presence of
MDRGN. Furthermore, using a standardized questionnaire, the characteristics of
the inhabitants were collected and their association with the likelihood for
colonization with MDRGN was analyzed.
RESULTS: MDRGN were found in 59 swabs, predominantly Escherichia coli (95%). The 
weighted prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was
19.1% and for MDRGN with additional resistances to fluoroquinolones was 12.3%.
Resistances to carbapenems or carbapenemases were not found. Multivariable as
well as univariable analysis recognized the presence of chronic wounds to be
a potential risk factor (OR: 2,66 [95 %-CI: 1,54-4,60]). Additionally, the
univariable analysis detected the necessity of a wheelchair and the accommodation
in double rooms as risk factors.
DISCUSSION: The prevalence of MDRGN found in our study is similar to findings of 
previous German studies. The result shows the importance of strict compliance
with basic hygiene guidelines for all inhabitants of LTCFs for the prevention of 
transmission of MDRGN.
