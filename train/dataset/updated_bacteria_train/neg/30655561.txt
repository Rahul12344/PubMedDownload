Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative 
lysosomal storage disorders. CLN5 deficiency causes a subtype of NCL, referred to
as CLN5 disease. CLN5 is a soluble lysosomal protein with an unclear function in 
the cell. Increased levels of the autophagy marker protein LC3-II have been
reported in several subtypes of NCLs. In this report, we examine whether
autophagy is altered in CLN5 disease. We found that the basal level of LC3-II was
elevated in both CLN5 disease patient fibroblasts and CLN5-deficient HeLa cells. 
Further analysis using tandem fluorescent mRFP-GFP-LC3 showed the autophagy flux 
was increased. We found the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) gene SNCA was highly
up-regulated in CLN5 disease patient fibroblasts. The aggregated form of α-syn is
well known for its role in the pathogenicity of Parkinson's disease. Higher α-syn
protein levels confirmed the SNCA up-regulation in both patient cells and CLN5
knockdown HeLa cells. Furthermore, α-syn was localized to the vicinity of
lysosomes in CLN5 deficient cells, indicating it may have a lysosome-related
function. Intriguingly, knocking down SNCA reversed lysosomal perinuclear
clustering caused by CLN5 deficiency. These results suggest α-syn may affect
lysosomal clustering in non-neuronal cells, similar to its role in presynaptic
vesicles in neurons.
