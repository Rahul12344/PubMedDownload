Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique T-cell population that is positively
selected by CD1d-expressing cells. In this study, we examined the kinetics of
conventional CD4+TCRbeta+ and CD4-TCRbeta+ cells along with various NKT cell
populations from WT and CD1d KO mice after oral Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)
infection at different time points in tissue compartments. We found that
CD4+TCRbeta+ cells expressing NK1.1+ (NKT) were constitutively expressed in the
lung of both strains of mice, but disappeared after infection. In contrast,
CD4-TCRbeta+ NK1.1+ cells migrated to the spleen. Here, we demonstrated that
endogenous IL-12 was predominantly expressed in the spleen of CD1d KO mice 2 days
after infection, whereas IL-4 was predominantly expressed in the liver of WT
mice. Higher levels of IFN-gamma were expressed in MLN of CD1d KO but not in WT
mice on day 5. Thus, tissue-specific ligands orchestrate the localization and
activation of NKT cells to control immune response to Listeria, which may explain
the difference in disease susceptibility.
