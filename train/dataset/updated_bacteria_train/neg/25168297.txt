BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the type of the mesh
and proper surgical technique can influence the outcome of a tension-free hernia 
repair in a contaminated filed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was based on the model of bacterial peritonitis
in rats induced with a mixture composed of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides
fragilis. Two animals were used as a control group without induced peritonitis
and 10 animals with mesh implanted inside of the peritoneal cavity. For the 20
animals in the studied group, bacterial fluid was applied into the abdominal
cavity together with the mesh implantation. In 10 cases, the mesh was fixed
flatly upon the surface of the peritoneum; in the other 10, the mesh was rolled
and then fixed within the peritoneal cavity. After 5 weeks, the animals were
operated on again, and the meshes, the peritoneal fluid and, if present, any
granulomas were taken for bacterial cultivation.
RESULTS: The results of the bacterial cultivation of the material from the
control group (without mesh) and from the rats with flatly fixed mesh were almost
completely negative (0/10 and 1/10, respectively). In 9 out of 10 rats that were 
exposed to the rolled mesh for 5 weeks, the colonisation of meshes with both B.
fragilis and E. coli was found (p < 0.0198).
CONCLUSIONS: When properly fixed, flat mesh, even in a contaminated field, may
allow for a proper mesh healing and does not influence the ability to cure
bacterial peritonitis in an animal model. A bad surgical technique, such as
inadequately positioned or rolled mesh, may cause persistent peritoneal
bacteraemia.
