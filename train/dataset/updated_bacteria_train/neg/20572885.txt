Oral care preparations are widely used for the treatment of oral malodour as
over-the-counter products. Bad breath is highly distressing to an individual's
confidence during social interaction, which is a large concern nowadays as the
consumption of these products is increasing worldwide. However, oral deodorant
ingredients are rarely studied compared with other cosmetic ingredients, and the 
only preparations which are well known are those contained in dentifrices and
mouthrinses. This review briefly summarizes the compounds which cause oral
malodour and the treatments available. The active ingredients in various
preparations are emphasized and novel products are presented.
