We report two cases of sepsis and meningoencephalitis with listeriosis. They died
in despite of administering sensitive antibiotics. A 2 day old girl was admitted 
to our hospital because of fever and cyanosis. Listeria monocytogenes type 4b was
cultured from blood, CSF, throat, urine, ear. She was treated with twice exchange
transfusion and sensitive antibiotics (ABPC, TOB), but died from DIC. A 48 year
old man suddenly experienced an unconscious condition. A CSF culture grew L.
monocytogenes type 1/2a. He was treated with sensitive antibiotics (ABPC, CEZ
etc), but went bad conditions. Listeria infection of this cases developed as
unfortunate infection.
