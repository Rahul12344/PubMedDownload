Infections at the surgical site continue to occur in as many as 20% of elective
colon resection cases. Methods to reduce these infections are inconsistently
applied. Surgical site infection (SSI) is the result of multiple interactive
variables including the inoculum of bacteria that contaminate the site, the
virulence of the contaminating microbes, and the local environment at the
surgical site. These variables that promote infection are potentially offset by
the effectiveness of the host defense. Reduction in the inoculum of bacteria is
achieved by appropriate surgical site preparation, systemic preventive
antibiotics, and use of mechanical bowel preparation in conjunction with the oral
antibiotic bowel preparation. Intraoperative reduction of hematoma, necrotic
tissue, foreign bodies, and tissue dead space will reduce infections. Enhancement
of the host may be achieved by perioperative supplemental oxygenation,
maintenance of normothermia, and glycemic control. These methods require
additional research to identify optimum application. Uniform application of
currently understood methods and continued research into new methods to reduce
microbial contamination and enhancement of host responsiveness can lead to better
outcomes.
