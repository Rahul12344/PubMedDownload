BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop an improved anti-TB vaccine for adequate
control and elimination of tuberculosis, to control the spread of MDR-TB and
TB/HIV co-infection. Studies in children have indicated that BCG vaccination has 
certain beneficial effects, especially against miliary TB and TB meningitis, but 
needs to be improved for protection against pulmonary tuberculosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify the immunogenic proteins 
in the culture filtrate (CF) of Mycobacterium bovis BCG by studying the effector 
mechanism of protection in children, which may help in the formulation of an
effective vaccine against tuberculosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphoproliferative responses (LTT) and the levels of IL-2
and IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokines) released into the culture supernatants were
estimated (by ELISA) in short-term cultures of PBMC of BCG vaccinated (n=25) and 
unvaccinated (n=15) children and children with tuberculosis (n=15) against 10
different fractions of CF (mol.wt > or = 90-<14 kDa).
RESULTS: The mean stimulation indices (SI) in LTT against all the (10) fractions 
in vaccinated children were high when compared to the unvaccinated and diseased
groups; however, of the 10 fractions, F3, F4, F6, F8 and F9 elicited
significantly higher SIs than the other fractions (p<0.05). In the vaccinated
children, the SI (5.58+/-1.57), levels of IL-2 (381.66+/-16.40 pg/ml) and
IFN-gamma (732+/-62.36 pg/ml) in the cultures stimulated by fraction 8 (34-30k
Da) were significantly higher (p<0.001), than responses to the other fractions
and also to those of other groups of children.
CONCLUSION: Thus, the peptides within the cluster 34-30 kDa appear to be
promising vaccine candidates by virtue of their immunodominant nature
specifically priming Th1 cells in normal, BCG-vaccinated children.
