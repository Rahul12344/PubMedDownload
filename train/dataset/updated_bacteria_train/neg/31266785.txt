The TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) is known to
be expressed on antigen-presenting cells and function as oncogenic drivers and as
inhibitors of inflammatory responses. Both human and mouse CD8+ T cells are
thought to be negative for TAM receptor expression. In this study, we show that
T-cell receptor (TCR)-activated human primary CD8+ T cells expressed MERTK and
the ligand PROS1 from day 2 postactivation. PROS1-mediated MERTK signaling served
as a late costimulatory signal, increasing proliferation and secretion of
effector and memory-associated cytokines. Knockdown and inhibition studies
confirmed that this costimulatory effect was mediated through MERTK.
Transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of PROS1-blocked CD8+ T cells demonstrated 
a role of the PROS1-MERTK axis in differentiation of memory CD8+ T cells.
Finally, using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from melanoma patients, we
show that MERTK signaling on T cells improved TIL expansion and TIL-mediated
autologous cancer cell killing. We conclude that MERTK serves as a late
costimulatory signal for CD8+ T cells. Identification of this costimulatory
function of MERTK on human CD8+ T cells suggests caution in the development of
MERTK inhibitors for hematologic or solid cancer treatment.
