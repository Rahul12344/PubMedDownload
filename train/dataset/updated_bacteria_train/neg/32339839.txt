It is essential to have tools that can be used to diagnose water resources. For
this reason, this study sets out on the one hand to assess water quality in three
reservoirs in Spain (Salas, A Baxe and Conchas) with Cyano-Habs problems through 
the application of water quality indexes: The National Sanitation Foundation
Water Quality Index (NFSWQI), the General Quality Index (GQI), the Trophic State 
Index (TSI), and the Trophic Contamination Index (ICOTRO). On the other hand, it 
seeks to learn how parameters such as nitrogen and phosphorus influence the
presence of cyanotoxin, specifically Microcystis aeruginosa. To that end, samples
from the three reservoirs are cultured and physical-chemical parameters and the
toxicity of the water are measured. The results show that Salas reservoir has the
worst water quality rating (GQI is bad and NFSWQI medium), while As Conchas and A
Baxe obtain very good figures for NFSWQI. This contrasts with the data obtained
via the TSI of moderately eutrophic conditions for all three reservoirs, and
hypereutrophic levels for As Conchas and A Baxe downstream. On the other hand,
the toxicity analysis shows levels of 1.12 ± 0.06 μg/l microcystin-LR (MC-LR) for
As Conchas, 0.64 ± 0.04 μg/l MC-LR for Salas, and 1.24 ± 0.05 μg/l MC-LR for A
Baxe, of which 20% corresponds to free MC-LR. This study finds that nitrogen is
the parameter that most favors the production of MC-LR. We conclude that the
eutrophication indexes are more reliable when studying the presence of
cyanobacteria. Furthermore, nitrogen and phosphorous are the most significant
parameters in this regard. They are taken into account in the quality indices
(GQI, NFSWI), but they are not sufficiently representative. It is recommended as 
a future line of research that water quality indices be adapted or designed to
incorporate eutrophication levels and even water toxicity.
