N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) catalyzes the production of N-acetylglutamate
(NAG) from acetyl-CoA and L-glutamate. In microorganisms and plants, the enzyme
functions in the arginine biosynthetic pathway, while in mammals, its major role 
is to produce the essential co-factor of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) 
in the urea cycle. Recent work has shown that several different genes encode
enzymes that can catalyze NAG formation. A bifunctional enzyme was identified in 
certain bacteria, which catalyzes both NAGS and N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK)
activities, the first two steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway.
Interestingly, these bifunctional enzymes have higher sequence similarity to
vertebrate NAGS than those of the classical (mono-functional) bacterial NAGS.
Solving the structures for both classical bacterial NAGS and bifunctional
vertebrate-like NAGS/K has advanced our insight into the regulation and catalytic
mechanisms of NAGS, and the evolutionary relationship between the two NAGS
groups.
