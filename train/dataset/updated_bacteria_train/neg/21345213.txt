BACKGROUND: Probiotics are increasingly used in the treatment of functional
gastrointestinal disorders. Studies in constipated adults with a Bifidus yoghurt 
(containing Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus
acidophilus) showed a significant increase in defecation frequency. The aim of
this pilot study was to determine if Bifidobacterium breve is effective in the
treatment of childhood constipation.
METHODS: Children, 3 to 16 years of age, with functional constipation according
to the Rome III criteria were eligible for this study. During 4 weeks, children
received one sachet of powder daily, containing 108- 1010 CFU Bifidobacterium
breve. Furthermore, children were instructed to try to defecate on the toilet for
5-10 minutes after each meal and to complete a standardized bowel diary daily.
The primary outcome measure was change in defecation frequency. Secondary outcome
measures were stool consistency using the Bristol stool scale frequency of
episodes of faecal incontinence, pain during defecation, frequency of abdominal
pain, frequency of adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea and bad taste), and
frequency of intake of bisacodyl.
RESULTS: Twenty children (75% male, mean age 7.4) were included in this pilot
study. The defecation frequency per week significantly increased from 0.9 (0-2)
at baseline to 4.9 (0-21) in week 4 (p < 0.01). The mean stool consistency score 
increased from 2.6 (2-4) at baseline to 3.5 (1-6) in week 4 (p = 0.03). The
number of faecal incontinence episodes per week significantly decreased from 9.0 
(0-35) at baseline to 1.5 (0-7) in week 4 (p < 0.01). Abdominal pain episodes per
week significantly decreased from 4.2 (0-7) at baseline to 1.9 (0-7) in week 4 (p
= 0.01). No side effects occurred.
CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterium breve is effective in increasing stool frequency in
children with functional constipation. Furthermore it has a positive effect with 
respect to stool consistency, decreasing the number of faecal incontinence
episodes and in diminishing abdominal pain. A randomized placebo controlled trial
is required to confirm these data.
