BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica infections often exhibit a form of immune
evasion. We previously observed that probiotic bacteria could prevent inhibition 
of lymphoproliferation and apoptosis responses of T cells associated with S.
enterica infections in orally challenged mice.
RESULTS: In this study, changes in expression of genes related to lymphocyte
activation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) of mice orally infected
with S. enterica with and without treatment with probiotic bacteria were
evaluated. Probiotic bacteria increased expression of mRNA for clusters of
differentiation antigen 2 (Cd2), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C
(Ptprc), and Toll-like receptor 6 (Tlr6) genes related to T and B cell activation
in mouse intestinal tissue. The probiotic bacteria were also associated with
reduced mRNA expression of a group of genes (RelB, Myd88, Iκκa, Jun, Irak2)
related to nuclear factor of kappa light chains enhancer in B cells (NF-κB)
signal transduction pathway-regulated cytokine responses. Probiotic bacteria were
also associated with reduced mRNA expression of apoptotic genes (Casp2, Casp12,
Dad1, Akt1, Bad) that suggest high avidity lymphocyte sparing. Reduced CD2
immunostaining in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) was suggestive of reduced
lymphocyte activation in probiotic-treated mice. Reduced immunostaining of TLR6
in MALT of probiotic-treated, S. enterica-infected mice suggests that diminished 
innate immune sensitivity to S. enterica antigens is associated with preventing
lymphocyte deletion.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are consistent with prevention of S.
enterica-induced deletion of lymphocytes by the influence of probiotic bacteria
in mucosal lymphoid tissues of mice.
