Legionella pneumophila is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia.
Domestic sources of infection have been increasingly recognised among
community-acquired cases. This report summarises the public health investigations
and management of a single community-acquired case of Legionnaires' disease in
Queensland, commenced in the context of a suspected outbreak. Legionellae from
the case's domestic water supply were indistinguishable from the clinical
isolate. The implications for future investigation of sporadic cases are
discussed.
