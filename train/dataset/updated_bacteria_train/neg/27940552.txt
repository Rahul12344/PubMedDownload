To prevent genomic instability, cells respond to DNA lesions by blocking cell
cycle progression and initiating DNA repair. Homologous recombination repair of
DNA breaks requires CtIP-dependent resection of the DNA ends, which is thought to
play a key role in activation of CHK1 kinase to induce the cell cycle checkpoint.
But the mechanism is still not fully understood. Here, we establish that And-1, a
replisome component, promotes DNA-end resection and DNA repair by homologous
recombination. Mechanistically, And-1 interacts with CtIP and regulates CtIP
recruitment to DNA damage sites. And-1 localizes to sites of DNA damage dependent
on MDC1-RNF8 pathway, and is required for resistance to many DNA-damaging and
replication stress-inducing agents. Furthermore, we show that And-1-CtIP axis is 
critically required for sustained ATR-CHK1 checkpoint signaling and for
maintaining both the intra-S- and G2-phase checkpoints. Our findings thus
identify And-1 as a novel DNA repair regulator and reveal how the replisome
regulates the DNA damage induced checkpoint and genomic stability.
