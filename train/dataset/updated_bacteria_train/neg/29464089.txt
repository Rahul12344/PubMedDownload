Identifying metastatic tumor growth at an early stage has been one of the biggest
challenges in the treatment of lung cancer. By genetic lineage tracing approach
in a conditional model of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in mice, we
demonstrate that cystic lesions represent an early stage of metastatic invasion. 
We generated a mouse model for NSCLC which incorporated a heritable DsRed
fluorescent tag driven by the ubiquitous CAG promoter in the alveolar type II
cells of the lung. We found early cystic lesions in a secondary organ (liver)
that lacked the expression of bona fide lung makers namely Scgb1a1 and surfactant
protein C Sftpc and were DsRed positive hence identifying lung as their source of
origin. This demonstrates the significant potential of alveolar type II cells in 
orchestrating the process of metastasis, rendering it as one of the target cell
types of the lung of therapeutic importance in human NSCLC.
