To study whether alpha6beta4 integrin regulates apoptosis, human A431 cells were 
plated on bacteria plates in the presence or absence of mAb beta4. In the absence
of mAb beta4, A431 cells demonstrated morphological characteristics of apoptosis 
by 24 h and most cells died by 48 h. In contrast, in the presence of mAb beta4,
cells remained viable, and at the end of 48 h, 70-80% of cells survived.
Treatment of A431 cells with mAb beta4 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of
the p85 subunit of PI3 kinase; PI3 kinase activity increased within 15 min and
peaked at 60 min. Stimulation of beta4 in A431 cells resulted in a time-dependent
phosphorylation of Akt with a concomitant and parallel phosphorylation of Bad.
Inactivation of PI3 kinase with inhibitors blocked the anti-apoptotic effect
induced by mAb beta4. These are the first results to suggest that ligation of
alpha6beta4 integrin protects cells from apoptosis through a PI3K/Akt kinase
signaling pathway.
