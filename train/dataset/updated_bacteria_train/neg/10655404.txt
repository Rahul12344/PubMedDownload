Campylobacter jejuni O:41 strains are found in association with Guillain-Barré
syndrome in South Africa. Strains of this serotype collected over 17 years were
characterized by amplified fragment length polymorphism and flagellin typing to
determine their clonal nature. Despite minor variation in GM1 expression, all of 
the strains were genetically indistinguishable, indicating that they are
representative of a genetically stable clone.
