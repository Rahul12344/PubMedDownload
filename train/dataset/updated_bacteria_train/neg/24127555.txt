KIR2DL4 (CD158d) is a distinct member of the killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR)
family in human NK cells that can induce cytokine production and cytolytic
activity in resting NK cells. Soluble HLA-G, normally expressed only by
fetal-derived trophoblast cells, was reported to be a ligand for KIR2DL4;
however, KIR2DL4 expression is not restricted to the placenta and can be found in
CD56(high) subset of peripheral blood NK cells. We demonstrated that KIR2DL4 can 
interact with alternative ligand(s), expressed by cells of epithelial or
fibroblast origin. A genome-wide high-throughput siRNA screen revealed that
KIR2DL4 recognition of cell-surface ligand(s) is directly regulated by heparan
sulfate (HS) glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1 (HS3ST3B1). KIR2DL4 was found
to directly interact with HS/heparin, and the D0 domain of KIR2DL4 was essential 
for this interaction. Accordingly, exogenous HS/heparin can regulate cytokine
production by KIR2DL4-expressing NK cells and HEK293T cells (HEK293T-2DL4), and
induces differential localization of KIR2DL4 to rab5(+) and rab7(+) endosomes,
thus leading to downregulation of cytokine production and degradation of the
receptor. Furthermore, we showed that intimate interaction of syndecan-4 (SDC4)
HS proteoglycan (HSPG) and KIR2DL4 directly affects receptor endocytosis and
membrane trafficking.
