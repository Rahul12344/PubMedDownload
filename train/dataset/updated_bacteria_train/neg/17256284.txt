This article highlights changes to the indoor environment that arise following
the introduction of energy efficiency measures in houses. It compares these
changes with the indoor environment in unimproved houses and discusses the
varying effects of each on health. The article argues that householders need to
adapt their lifestyles and house management methods to their new indoor
environment. It discusses a range of ways in which health professionals can help.
