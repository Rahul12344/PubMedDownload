Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) selectively kill breast and
ovarian cancers with defects in homologous recombination (HR) caused by BRCA1/2
mutations. There is also clinical evidence for the utility of PARPi in breast and
ovarian cancers without BRCA mutations, but the underlying mechanism is not
clear. Here, we report that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP15 affects cancer cell
response to PARPi by regulating HR. Mechanistically, USP15 is recruited to DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) by MDC1, which requires the FHA domain of MDC1 and
phosphorylated Ser678 of USP15. Subsequently, USP15 deubiquitinates BARD1 BRCT
domain, and promotes BARD1-HP1Î³ interaction, resulting in BRCA1/BARD1 retention
at DSBs. USP15 knockout mice exhibit genomic instability in vivo. Furthermore,
cancer-associated USP15 mutations, with decreased USP15-BARD1 interaction,
increases PARP inhibitor sensitivity in cancer cells. Thus, our results identify 
a novel regulator of HR, which is a potential biomarker for therapeutic treatment
using PARP inhibitors in cancers.
