Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that results from T
cell-mediated destruction of pancreatic β cells. CD1d-restricted NKT lymphocytes 
have the ability to regulate immunity, including autoimmunity. We previously
demonstrated that CD1d-restricted type II NKT cells, which carry diverse TCRs,
prevented T1D in the NOD mouse model for the human disease. In this study, we
show that CD4(+) 24αβ type II NKT cells, but not CD4/CD8 double-negative NKT
cells, were sufficient to downregulate diabetogenic CD4(+) BDC2.5 NOD T cells in 
adoptive transfer experiments. CD4(+) 24αβ NKT cells exhibited a memory phenotype
including high ICOS expression, increased cytokine production, and limited
display of NK cell markers, compared with double-negative 24αβ NKT cells.
Blocking of ICOS or the programmed death-1/programmed death ligand 1 pathway was 
shown to abolish the regulation that occurred in the pancreas draining lymph
nodes. To our knowledge, these results provide for the first time cellular and
molecular information on how type II CD1d-restricted NKT cells regulate T1D.
