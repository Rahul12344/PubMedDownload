The purpose of this work was to characterize 47 Escherichia coli strains isolated
from 32 pigs diagnosed with postweaning diarrhea and three pigs with edema
disease by PCR. Forty two (95.5 %) of the strains isolated from diarrheic pigs
were characterized as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and 2 (4.5 %) as Shiga
toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Fourteen (33.3 %) ETEC strains were positive for 
est/estII/fedA genes. The most complex genotype was eltA/estI/faeG/aidA. Strains 
isolated from pigs with ED were classified as porcine STEC and were stx2e/aidA
carriers. Eleven (25 %) strains carried the gene encoding adhesin protein AIDA-I.
However, genes coding for F5, F6, F41, intimin and Paa were not detected. The
development of vaccines generating antibodies against prevalent E. coli adhesins 
in Argentina could be useful for the prevention of PWD and ED.
