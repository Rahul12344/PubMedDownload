The T-cell immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is critical in
preventing clinical disease. While it is generally accepted that both major
histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted CD8(+) and
MHC-II-restricted CD4(+) T cells are important for the immune response to M.
tuberculosis, the role of non-MHC-restricted T cells is still not clearly
delineated. We have previously reported that CD1d(-/-) mice do not differ from
CD1d(+/+) mice in their survival following infection with M. tuberculosis. We now
show that, although CD1d-restricted NKT cells are not required for optimum
immunity to M. tuberculosis, specific activation of NKT cells by the CD1d ligand 
alpha-galactosylceramide protects susceptible mice from tuberculosis. Treatment
with alpha-galactosylceramide reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs,
diminished tissue injury, and prolonged survival of mice following inoculation
with virulent M. tuberculosis. The capacity of activated NKT cells to stimulate
innate immunity and modulate the adaptive immune response to promote a potent
antimicrobial immune response suggests that alpha-galactosylceramide
administration could have a role in new strategies for the therapy of infectious 
diseases.
