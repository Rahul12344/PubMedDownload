Although isoniazid (INH) has been successful in treating Tuberculosis (TB) since 
its introduction in 1952, there has been continual reports of drug-associated
hepatotoxicity in TB patients. These toxic side effects may reveal more about the
recipient of the drug, than the drug itself. A combination of pharmacogenetic and
pharmacokinetic studies have identified polymorphisms within enzymes involved in 
INH metabolism and detoxification. These essential metabolic enzymes include
N-acetyltransferase 2, Cytochrome P450 2E1, and glutathione S transferases.
Different phenotypes of these enzymes can affect the rate of INH metabolism,
resulting in production of hepatotoxic metabolites. This review is intended to
elucidate the pharmacokinetics of INH by examining its Administration,
Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination, while suggesting potential
alternatives within INH personalized treatment to help reduce hepatotoxicity.
