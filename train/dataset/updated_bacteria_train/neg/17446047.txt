Autotransporters are simple systems that Gram-negative bacteria employ to secrete
proteins to their surfaces or into the extracellular milieu. They consist of an
N-terminal passenger domain and a C-terminal domain that is thought to insert
into the outer membrane and mediate the secretion of the passenger domain.
Despite the apparent simplicity of these secretion systems, their mechanism of
translocation is still not completely understood. To study this mechanism, we
used the AIDA-I autotransporter adhesin of Escherichia coli. We introduced
mutations at several sites in a junction region of the passenger domain, close to
the membrane-embedded domain. We observed that the mutations dramatically
affected the biogenesis of AIDA-I. The same mutations, however, did not affect
the translocation of a chimeric construct where MalE, the E. coli periplasmic
maltose binding protein, replaced most of the passenger domain of AIDA-I. Our
results emphasize the function of this region in the biogenesis of AIDA-I and
suggest that it plays its role by interacting with and/or promoting folding of
native passenger domains.
