BACKGROUND: BAD protein (Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death) belongs to the BH3-only 
subfamily of proapoptotic proteins and is proposed to function as the sentinel of
the cellular health status. Physiological activity of BAD is regulated by
phosphorylation, association with 14-3-3 proteins, binding to membrane lipids and
pore formation. Since the functional role of the BAD C-terminal part has not been
considered so far, we have investigated here the interplay of the structure and
function of this region.
METHODS: The structure of the regulatory C-terminal part of human BAD was
analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The channel-forming activity of full-length BAD and 
BAD peptides was carried out by lipid bilayer measurements. Interactions between 
proteins and peptides were monitored by the surface plasmon resonance technique. 
In aqueous solution, C-terminal part of BAD exhibits a well-ordered structure and
stable conformation. In a lipid environment, the helical propensity considerably 
increases. The interaction of the C-terminal segment of BAD with the isolated BH3
domain results in the formation of permanently open pores whereby the
phosphorylation of serine 118 within the BH3 domain is necessary for effective
pore formation. In contrast, phosphorylation of serine 99 in combination with
14-3-3 association suppresses formation of channels. C-terminal part of BAD
controls BAD function by structural transitions, lipid binding and
phosphorylation. Conformational changes of this region upon membrane interaction 
in conjunction with phosphorylation of the BH3 domain suggest a novel mechanism
for regulation of BAD.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple signaling pathways mediate inhibition and
activation of cell death via BAD.
