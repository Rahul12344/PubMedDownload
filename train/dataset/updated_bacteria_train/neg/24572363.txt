B lymphocytes have critical roles as positive and negative regulators of
immunity. Their inhibitory function has been associated primarily with
interleukin 10 (IL-10) because B-cell-derived IL-10 can protect against
autoimmune disease and increase susceptibility to pathogens. Here we identify
IL-35-producing B cells as key players in the negative regulation of immunity.
Mice in which only B cells did not express IL-35 lost their ability to recover
from the T-cell-mediated demyelinating autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, these mice displayed a markedly improved
resistance to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium as shown by their superior containment of the
bacterial growth and their prolonged survival after primary infection, and upon
secondary challenge, compared to control mice. The increased immunity found in
mice lacking IL-35 production by B cells was associated with a higher activation 
of macrophages and inflammatory T cells, as well as an increased function of B
cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). During Salmonella infection, IL-35- and
IL-10-producing B cells corresponded to two largely distinct sets of
surface-IgM(+)CD138(hi)TACI(+)CXCR4(+)CD1d(int)Tim1(int) plasma cells expressing 
the transcription factor Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1). During EAE, CD138(+)
plasma cells were also the main source of B-cell-derived IL-35 and IL-10.
Collectively, our data show the importance of IL-35-producing B cells in
regulation of immunity and highlight IL-35 production by B cells as a potential
therapeutic target for autoimmune and infectious diseases. This study reveals the
central role of activated B cells, particularly plasma cells, and their
production of cytokines in the regulation of immune responses in health and
disease.
