Recognition of transcription regulatory sites in bacterial genomes is a
notoriously difficult problem. There are no algorithms capable of making reliable
predictions even for well-studied sites such as the CRP (cyclic AMP receptor
protein) box. However, availability of complete bacterial genomes makes it
possible to make reliable predictions with bad rules. This comparative approach
is based on the assumption that sets of co-regulated genes are conserved in
related bacteria. Thus true sites occur upstream of orthologous genes, whereas
false candidates are scattered at random. This means not only that knowledge
about regulation in well-studied genomes can be transferred to newly sequenced
ones, but also that new members of regulons can be found. This paper reviews
several recent studies. In particular, a detailed analysis of catabolite
repression in gamma-purple bacteria is presented.
