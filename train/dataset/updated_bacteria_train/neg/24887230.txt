BACKGROUND: There is growing concern on the residual risk of bacterial
contamination of platelet concentrates in Germany, despite the reduction of the
shelf-life of these concentrates and the introduction of bacterial screening. In 
this study, the applicability of the BactiFlow flow cytometric assay for
bacterial screening of platelet concentrates on day 2 or 3 of their shelf-life
was assessed in two German blood services. The results were used to evaluate
currently implemented or newly discussed screening strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two thousand and ten apheresis platelet concentrates were 
tested on day 2 or day 3 after donation using BactiFlow flow cytometry. Reactive 
samples were confirmed by the BacT/Alert culture system.
RESULTS: Twenty-four of the 2,100 platelet concentrates tested were reactive in
the first test by BactiFlow. Of these 24 platelet concentrates, 12 were
false-positive and the other 12 were initially reactive. None of the
microbiological cultures of the initially reactive samples was positive. Parallel
examination of 1,026 platelet concentrates by culture revealed three positive
platelet concentrates with bacteria detected only in the anaerobic culture bottle
and identified as Staphylococcus species. Two platelet concentrates were
confirmed positive for Staphylcoccus epidermidis by culture. Retrospective
analysis of the growth kinetics of the bacteria indicated that the bacterial
titres were most likely below the diagnostic sensitivity of the BactiFlow assay
(<300 CFU/mL) and probably had no transfusion relevance.
CONCLUSIONS: The BactiFlow assay is very convenient for bacterial screening of
platelet concentrates independently of the testing day and the screening
strategy. Although the optimal screening strategy could not be defined, this
study provides further data to help achieve this goal.
