An emerging number of non-chemokine mediators are found to bind to classical
chemokine receptors and to elicit critical biological responses. Macrophage
migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine that exhibits
chemokine-like activities through non-cognate interactions with the chemokine
receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4, in addition to activating the type II receptor CD74.
Activation of the MIF-CXCR2 and -CXCR4 axes promotes leukocyte recruitment,
mediating the exacerbating role of MIF in atherosclerosis and contributing to the
wealth of other MIF biological activities. Although the structural basis of the
MIF-CXCR2 interaction has been well studied and was found to engage a pseudo-ELR 
and an N-like loop motif, nothing is known about the regions of CXCR4 and MIF
that are involved in binding to each other. Using a genetic strain of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae that expresses a functional CXCR4 receptor,
site-specific mutagenesis, hybrid CXCR3/CXCR4 receptors, pharmacological
reagents, peptide array analysis, chemotaxis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and
circular dichroism, we provide novel molecular information about the structural
elements that govern the interaction between MIF and CXCR4. The data identify
similarities with classical chemokine-receptor interactions but also provide
evidence for a partial allosteric agonist compared with CXCL12 that is possible
due to the two binding sites of CXCR4.
