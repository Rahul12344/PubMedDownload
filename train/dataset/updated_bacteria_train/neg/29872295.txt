Background: Anticaries agents must interfere with the adhesion of Streptococcus
mutans and its proliferation in dental biofilm, without causing host toxicity and
bacterial resistance. Natural substances, including cationic antimicrobial
peptides (CAMPs) and their fragments, such as β-defensin-3 peptide fragment
(D1-23), have been widely studied. However, the chemical and physical stability
of CAMPs may be compromised by external factors, such as temperature and pH,
reducing the period of antimicrobial activity.
Methods: To overcome the aforementioned disadvantage, this study developed and
character-ized a drug delivery system and evaluated the cytotoxicity and effect
against S. mutans biofilm of a D1-23-loaded bioadhesive liquid crystalline system
(LCS). LCS was composed of oleic acid,
polyoxypropylene-(5)-polyoxyethylene-(20)-cetyl alcohol, Carbopol® 974P and
Carbopol® 971P. LCS was analyzed by polarized light microscopy (PLM), rheology
(viscoelasticity and flow properties) and in vitro bioadhesion. The viability of 
epithelial cells was evaluated. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and
minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) against S. mutans were determined for
D1-23 for further evaluation of the effect against S. mutans biofilm after 4 and 
24 h of exposure to treatments.
Results: PLM, rheology, and in vitro bioadhesion tests showed that both viscosity
and bioadhesion of LCS increased after it was diluted with artificial saliva.
D1-23-loaded LCS system presented better activity against S. mutans biofilm after
24 h when compared to 4 h of treatment, showing a cumulative effect. Neither LCS 
nor D1-23-loaded LCS presented toxicity on human epithelial cells.
Conclusion: D1-23-loaded LCS is a promising drug delivery system for the
prevention of dental caries.
