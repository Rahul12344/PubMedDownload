Distribution of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus in sewage works, river water, and
sediments.

Fry JC, Staples DG.

Bdellovibrio was found in all liquid phases of the sewage works examined. The
predator was also found in all the river sediments and sewage-polluted river
waters examined but could not be found in some unpolluted river waters.
Bdellovibrio was able to multiply on the high numbers of bacteria present in the 
aerobic percolating filter film but could not survive in anaerobic sludge.
Similarly, the predator was present in the aerobic surface layers of river
sediments but not in the anaerobic bottom layers. The major source of
Bdellovibrio in the polluted rivers examined were sewage works effluents, and
numbers in both river water and sediment were correlated with river water
quality. It was unlikely that Bdellovibrio was important in reducing numbers of
other bacteria in either sewage or river sediment.
