BACKGROUND: Based on sporadic reports of microbial contamination of mineral
waters, it has been recommended that, for safety reasons, particularly
immunocompromised patients should drink tap water rather than bottled mineral
water. However, in terms of safety, evidence of the clinical consequences may
allow a better estimate than a positive in vitro test for contamination.
Therefore, we reviewed the literature on documented disease outbreaks due to
contaminated mineral and tap waters.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature using
the database MEDLINE. In order to identify evidence relevant for Germany, we
restricted our search to the years 1985-1997 (i.e. legal force of the mineral and
table waters act in Germany) and the countries of Central and Northwestern Europe
as well as the USA and Canada.
RESULTS: Cases of contamination of tap water were documented in nearly all
countries included. In 35 communications we found reports on a total of 423,000
cases of disease outbreaks due to contaminated tap water, in some cases even with
lethal outcome. Main diagnosis was gastroenteritis, and main species of
microorganism was crytosporidium. In contrast, there was no documented case of
disease outbreak due to contaminated bottled mineral water.
CONCLUSION: Tap water as well as bottled water are both supremely safe components
of nutrition. The recommendation that tap water is better than mineral water,
particularly for high-risk patients, is not supported by the literature.
