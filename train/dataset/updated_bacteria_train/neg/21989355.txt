Aging-associated increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity appears
to be unrelated to the transcription of the IDO1 or IDO2 genes in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells.

BACKGROUND: Old age is associated with increased levels of circulating
pro-inflammatory cytokines, a phenomenon termed inflamm-aging. Elevated levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with several age-associated
diseases and with a shortened lifespan. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has
immunomodulatory properties and its activity is elevated in inflammation,
autoimmune disorders and malignancies. We have previously shown that IDO activity
is increased in nonagenarians compared to young individuals and that high IDO
activity is associated with mortality at old age.
FINDINGS: In this study our aim was to assess whether this difference in IDO
activity in the plasma was due to the differential expression of either the IDO1 
or IDO2 gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results show that IDO1
and IDO2 are not differently expressed in nonagenarians compared to controls and 
that the expression of IDO genes is not associated with the level of IDO activity
in the plasma.
CONCLUSION: The level of IDO activity in the plasma is not regulated through the 
expression of IDO1 or IDO2 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
