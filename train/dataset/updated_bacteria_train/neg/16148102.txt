In this study we show that like MHC class I and class II molecules, cell surface 
CD1d expression on APC is regulated and affects T cell activation under
physiological conditions. Although IFN-gamma alone is sufficient for optimum
expression of MHC, CD1d requires two signals, one provided by IFN-gamma and a
second mediated by microbial products or by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF.
IFN-gamma-dependent CD1d up-regulation occurs on macrophages following infection 
with live bacteria or exposure to microbial products in vitro and in vivo. APC
expressing higher CD1d levels more efficiently activate NKT cell hybridomas and
primary NKT cells independently of whether the CD1d-restricted TCR recognizes
foreign or self-lipid Ags. Our findings support a model in which CD1d induction
regulates NKT cell activation.
