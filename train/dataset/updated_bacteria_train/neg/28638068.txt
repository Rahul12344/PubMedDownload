The regional specialization of intestinal immune cells is affected by the
longitudinal heterogeneity of environmental factors. Although the distribution of
group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) is well characterized in the lamina
propria, it is poorly defined in Peyer's patches (PPs) along the intestine. Given
that PP ILC3s are closely associated with mucosal immune regulation, it is
important to characterize the regulatory mechanism of ILC3s. Here, we found that 
terminal ileal PPs of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice have fewer NKp46+ ILC3s
than jejunal PPs, while there was no difference in NKp46+ ILC3 numbers between
terminal ileal and jejunal PPs in antibiotics (ABX)-treated mice. We also found
that butyrate levels in the terminal ileal PPs of SPF mice were higher than those
in the jejunal PPs of SPF mice and terminal ileal PPs of ABX-treated mice. The
reduced number of NKp46+ ILC3s in terminal ileal PPs resulted in a decrease in
Csf2 expression and, in turn, resulted in reduced regulatory T cells and enhanced
antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. Thus, we suggest that NKp46+ ILC3s are
negatively regulated by microbiota-derived butyrate in terminal ileal PPs and the
reduced ILC3 frequency is closely associated with antigen-specific immune
induction in terminal ileal PPs.
