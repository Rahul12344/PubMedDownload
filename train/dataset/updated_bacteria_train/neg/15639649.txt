The anti-inflammatory action of methotrexate is not mediated by lymphocyte
apoptosis, but by the suppression of activation and adhesion molecules.

Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is an established and highly effective treatment for 
severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis; however, its mechanism of action
remains unclear. We investigated the effects of low-dose MTX on
antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and explored through which 
cellular pathways these effects are mediated. We show that MTX caused a
dose-dependent suppression of T cell activation and adhesion molecule expression,
and this was not due to lymphocyte apoptosis. The suppression of intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was adenosine and folate-dependent, while MTX
suppression of the skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) was 
adenosine-independent. The effect of MTX on CLA, but not ICAM-1, required the
constant presence of MTX in cultures. Thus, the suppression of T cell activation 
and T cell adhesion molecule expression, rather than apoptosis, mediated in part 
by adenosine or polyglutamated MTX or both, are important mechanisms in the
anti-inflammatory action of MTX.
