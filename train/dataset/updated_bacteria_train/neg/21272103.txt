BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination is currently the major infectious hazard of
platelet transfusion in developed countries. It has been demonstrated that a
significant transfusion risk remains, in particular with older platelet
concentrates (PCs). In 2009, the shelf life of PCs was therefore reduced in
Germany to 4 days after the day of production according to Vote 38. The aim of
the present study was the application and implementation of a recently developed 
flow cytometry-based rapid screening method (BactiFlow) for bacterial
contamination at the end of PC shelf life as a routine in-process control.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 472 apheresis-derived PCs were tested using 
the BactiFlow flow cytometric assay to detect and count bacteria based on
esterase activity in viable bacterial cells, while the BacT/Alert automated
culture system served as the reference method. The automation potential of the
flow cytometric assay was analysed by applying the semi-automated BactiFlow ALS
system.
RESULTS: An algorithm was developed for use in routine blood bank operations to
extend the storage period of PCs. Two of the 472 apheresis PCs tested were
positive in culture and identified as Propionibacterium species. One PC was
positive for Staphylococcus aureus by both methods. All remaining specimens were 
tested negative by both methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that routine bacterial testing of PCs was
successfully implemented and the established algorithm proved efficient. The
BactiFlow flow cytometric assay is the first rapid screening method which is
suitable for a routine application combined with a high sensitivity.
