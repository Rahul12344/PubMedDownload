Mediterranean Botonous Fever (MBF) is an infectious disease which provokes
multisystemic vasculitis due to endothelial proliferation of rickettsia conorii. 
Its incidence, in our environment, has greatly increased during the last years
being endemic in many large cities and their surrounding suburbs. In some cases
its evolution is specially malignant resulting in septic shock, adult respiratory
distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. The purpose of this communication is
to present a new case of malignant MBF with a bad evolution factor which has not 
been previously referred to, which is the persistence of vector ticks in the
inoculation spot.
