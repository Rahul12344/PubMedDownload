Deciphering how signaling pathways interact during development is necessary for
understanding the etiopathogenesis of congenital malformations and disease. In
several embryonic structures, components of the Hedgehog and retinoic acid
pathways, two potent players in development and disease are expressed and operate
in the same or adjacent tissues and cells. Yet whether and, if so, how these
pathways interact during organogenesis is, to a large extent, unclear. Using
genetic and experimental approaches in the mouse, we show that during development
of ontogenetically different organs, including the tail, genital tubercle, and
secondary palate, Sonic hedgehog (SHH) loss-of-function causes anomalies
phenocopying those induced by enhanced retinoic acid signaling and that SHH is
required to prevent supraphysiological activation of retinoic signaling through
maintenance and reinforcement of expression of the Cyp26 genes. Furthermore, in
other tissues and organs, disruptions of the Hedgehog or the retinoic acid
pathways during development generate similar phenotypes. These findings reveal
that rigidly calibrated Hedgehog and retinoic acid activities are required for
normal organogenesis and tissue patterning.
