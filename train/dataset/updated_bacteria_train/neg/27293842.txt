BACKGROUND: Due to the complex therapy and the required high level of
immunosuppression, lung recipients are at high risk to develop many different
long term complications.
METHODS: From 1993-2000, a total of 54 lung transplantation (LuTx) were performed
at our center. Complications, graft and patient survival of this cohort was
retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: One/five and ten-year patient survival was 71.4%, 41.2% and 25.4%; at
last follow up (4/2010), twelve patients were alive. Of the 39 deceased patients,
26 died from infectious complications. Other causes of death were myocardial
infarction (n=1), progressive graft failure (n=1), intracerebral bleeding (n=2), 
basilary vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary emboli (n=1), others (n=7). Surgical
complication rate was 27.7% during the first year and 25% for the 12 long term
survivors. Perioperative rejection rate was 35%, and 91.6% for the 12 patients
currently alive. Infection incidence during first hospitalization was 79.6% (1.3 
episodes per transplant) and 100% for long term survivors. Commonly isolated
pathogens were cytomegalovirus (56.8%), Aspergillus (29.4%), RSV (13.7%). Other
common complications were renal failure (56.8%), osteoporosis (54.9%),
hypertension (45%), diabetes mellitus (19.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Infection and rejection remain the most common complications
following LuTx with many other events to be considered.
