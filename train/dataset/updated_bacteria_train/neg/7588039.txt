HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 65-year-old diabetic (requiring insulin during
the last year) was admitted as an emergency because of a septic temperature
rising to 40 degrees C with rigor, tachycardia (up to 120/min) and dyspnoea. On
examination there was local reddening and swelling of the skin over the right
thenar eminence and along the lower arm. Two days before admission a bad scratch 
had been inflicted on his right hand by a cat. He had first noticed the reddening
and swelling 10 hours after the incident; 1 1/2 days after the scratch and 9-10
hours before hospitalization the first bouts of fever had occurred.
EXAMINATIONS: The chest radiogram showed interstitial pneumonia. The clinical
findings, the laboratory tests (white cell count 21 750/microliters, platelets
140,000/microliters, C-reactive protein 35 mg/l and positive blood cultures
pointed to early septicaemia. The germ was identified as Pasteurella multocida
two days after blood had been taken for culturing. HbA1c was 11.38%.
TREATMENT AND COURSE: From the time of hospitalization the patient had been
treated with ceftriaxon, 2 g daily intravenously, and also with erythromycin
because atypical pneumonia had been the suspected diagnosis at first and acute
chlamydia infection had at first not been excluded. The patient's general
condition quickly improved and the fever started to go down a few hours after
onset of treatment. Blood cultures became negative after the first administration
of antibiotics. He was discharged in a good state on optimal insulin dosage.
CONCLUSION: Pasteurella multocida is present in a high percentage of domestic
animals and can be the cause of systemic infections in immunocompromised patients
(e. g. poorly controlled diabetes mellitus).
