BAD, a member of the Bcl-2 protein family, promotes mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis. Here, we report that BAD dissociates from 14-3-3zeta at each G2/M
phase of proliferating lymphoid cells. The cell cycle-dependent dissociation of
BAD was associated with phosphorylation at Ser-128, whereas mutant S128A-BAD, in 
which Ser-128 was converted to alanine, remained associated with 14-3-3zeta
throughout the cell cycle. Although the cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD 
per se did not induce apoptosis, growth factor deprivation induced prompt
apoptosis at the G2/M phase but not at the G1 phase. In cells expressing
S128A-BAD, growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis was markedly delayed and
was accompanied by a delayed dephosphorylation of growth factor-dependent
regulatory serine residues. These results indicate that BAD induces apoptosis
upon detecting the coincidence of G2/M phase and growth factor deprivation.
