Accumulating evidence indicates that microbiota plays a critical role in
physiological processes in humans. However, it might also contribute to body
malodor by producing numerous odorous molecules such as ammonia, volatile sulfur 
compounds or trimethylamine. Although malodor is commonly overlooked by
physicians, it constitutes a major problem for many otherwise healthy people.
Thus, this review aims to investigate most common causes of malodor and describe 
potential therapeutic options. We searched PUBMED and Google Scholar databases to
identify the clinical and pre-clinical studies on bad body smell, malodor,
halitosis and microbiota. Unpleasant smell might originate from the mouth, skin, 
urine or reproductive fluids and is usually caused by odorants that are produced 
by resident bacterial flora. The accumulation of odorous compounds might result
from diet, specific composition of microbiota, as well as compromised function of
the liver, intestines and kidneys. Evidence-based guidelines for management of
body malodor are lacking and no universal treatment exists. However, the
alleviation of the symptoms may be achieved by controlling the diet and physical 
elimination of bacteria and/or accumulated odorants.
