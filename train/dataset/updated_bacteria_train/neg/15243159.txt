A group of T cells recognizes glycolipids presented by molecules of the CD1
family. The CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells (NKT cells) are primarily
considered to be self-reactive. By employing CD1d-binding and T cell assays, the 
following structural parameters for presentation by CD1d were defined for a
number of mycobacterial and mammalian lipids: two acyl chains facilitated
binding, and a polar head group was essential for T cell recognition. Of the
mycobacterial lipids tested, only a phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM)
fulfilled the requirements for CD1d binding and NKT cell stimulation. This PIM
activated human and murine NKT cells via CD1d, thereby triggering
antigen-specific IFN-gamma production and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and
PIM-loaded CD1d tetramers identified a subpopulation of murine and human NKT
cells. This phospholipid, therefore, represents a mycobacterial antigen
recognized by T cells in the context of CD1d.
