Deoxyribonucleic acid-ribonucleic acid hybridization. Annealing and quantitative 
recovery of intact ribosomal ribonucleic acid molecules from hybrids.

Fry M, Artman M.

A simple and efficient method for hybridization and subsequent recovery of
non-fragmented ribosomal RNA from the hybrid is described. The procedure involves
annealing of immobilized denatured DNA bound on cellulose nitrate membrane
filters to complementary RNA in 50% (v/v) formamide-0.33m-potassium
chloride-10mm-tris-hydrochloric acid buffer, pH7.4, at 33 degrees for 3hr. Under 
these conditions no detectable changes in the sedimentation coefficients of the
input RNA were detected. The RNA can subsequently be recovered quantitatively
from the hybrid in intact form by incubating the filters in formamide or in 85%
(v/v) dimethyl sulphoxide. The applicability of the method for the evaluation of 
the absolute size of ribosomal RNA cistrons in Escherichia coli DNA and for the
determination of the size of messenger RNA molecules is discussed.
