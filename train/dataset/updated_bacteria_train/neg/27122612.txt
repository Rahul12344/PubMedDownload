Boosting innate immunity represents an important therapeutic alternative to
antibiotics. However, the molecular selectivity of this approach is a major
concern because innate immune responses often cause collateral tissue damage. We 
identify the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), a
heterodimer partner of IRF-3, as a target for non-antibiotics-based therapy of
bacterial infections. We found that the efficient and self-limiting innate immune
response to bacterial infection relies on a tight balance between IRF-3 and
IRF-7. Deletion of Irf3 resulted in overexpression of Irf7 and led to an
IRF-7-driven hyperinflammatory phenotype, which was entirely prevented if Irf7
was deleted. We then identified a network of strongly up-regulated,
IRF-7-dependent genes in Irf3(-/-) mice with kidney pathology, which was absent
in Irf7(-/-) mice. IRF-3 and IRF-7 from infected kidney cell nuclear extracts
were shown to bind OAS1, CCL5, and IFNB1 promoter oligonucleotides. These data
are consistent in children with low IRF7 expression in the blood: attenuating
IRF7 promoter polymorphisms (rs3758650-T and rs10902179-G) negatively associated 
with recurrent pyelonephritis. Finally, we identified IRF-7 as a target for
immunomodulatory therapy. Administering liposomal Irf7 siRNA to Irf3(-/-) mice
suppressed mucosal IRF-7 expression, and the mice were protected against
infection and renal tissue damage. These findings offer a response to the
classical but unresolved question of "good versus bad inflammation" and identify 
IRF7 as a therapeutic target for protection against bacterial infection.
