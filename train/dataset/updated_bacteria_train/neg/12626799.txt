Whipple's disease (WD) is an uncommon polysystem infectious disease. In the
present report, we describe a patient who presented with a chronic illness
consistent with WD and an avascular necrosis of the right hip joint. WD and its
proposed causative bacillus, Tropheryma whippelii, was identified by molecular
analysis (polymerase chain reaction) in bacterial DNA extracted from the synovial
fluid. The diagnosis was additionally confirmed by upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy and a small bowel biopsy with macrophages positive for periodic
acid-Schiff reagent demonstrated by light and electron microscopy. This
demonstrates that WD can be diagnosed without tissue biopsy. False diagnosis of
the polymorphous signs and symptoms of WD can lead to invalidism and even death, 
whereas correct therapy leads to a cure in most cases. Thus, the current status
of diagnosis and therapy is of key importance in the treatment of WD.
