Bloodstream infections present many challenges to clinicians. The number of
hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection continues to increase, and the
number of newly available antimicrobial agents to treat these particularly lethal
infections and many other serious infections continues to decrease.
Drug-development programs for bloodstream infection that have adhered to existing
regulatory guidelines have not been significantly successful. This article
examines the regulatory history of the bloodstream infection indication as an
example of the challenges faced by individuals and sponsors developing drugs for 
treatment of the current spectrum of antimicrobial-resistant infections, with the
goal of providing insight into development pathways for agents targeting
drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Disease-specific and pathogen-specific
indications are discussed, and recent regulatory approvals for bloodstream
infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are reviewed.
