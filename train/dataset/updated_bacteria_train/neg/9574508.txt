We have initiated a mutational analysis of pathogenicity in the rice blast
fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, in which hygromycin-resistant transformants, most
generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI), were screened for
the ability to infect plants. A rapid primary infection assay facilitated
screening of 5,538 transformants. Twenty-seven mutants were obtained that showed 
a reproducible pathogenicity defect, and 18 of these contained mutations that
cosegregated with the hygromycin resistance marker. Analysis of eight mutants has
resulted in the cloning of seven PTH genes that play a role in pathogenicity on
barley, weeping lovegrass, and rice. Two independent mutants identified the same 
gene, PTH2, suggesting nonrandom insertion of the transforming DNA. These first 7
cloned PTH genes are described.
