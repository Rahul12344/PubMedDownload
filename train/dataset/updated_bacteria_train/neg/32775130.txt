Dysbiosis, defined as an imbalance in the gut microbiota caused by too few
beneficial bacteria and an overgrowth of bad bacteria, yeast, and/or parasites,
is now being associated with several diseases, including the development of
colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In this study, the potential association of
Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) with CRC was
investigated. Plasma samples obtained from preoperative histologically confirmed 
CRC patients (n=39) and their age- and sex-matched clinically healthy controls
(n=39) were analyzed for antibodies to toxin B of C. difficile (anti-tcdB) by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A significantly greater number
(p=0.012) of CRC cases (n=26/39, 66.7%) had anti-tcdB IgG levels above the cutoff
value compared with controls (n=12/39, 30.8%). Eight cases (8/39, 20.5%) and none
of the controls registered anti-tcdB IgA levels above the cutoff value
(p=0.0039). Anti-tcdB IgG and IgA levels were not shown to be significantly
associated with tumor grade or tumor stage. Anti-tcdB IgG showed 66.7%
sensitivity and 69.2% specificity. For anti-tcdB IgA, sensitivity and specificity
were 20.5% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive values for anti-tcdB
IgA and IgG were 100% and 68.4%, respectively. The anti-tcdB IgA and IgG negative
predictive values were 55.7% and 67.5%, respectively. The results suggest the
potential association of C. difficile with CRC and anti-tcdB levels, particularly
the IgA level. Hence, anti-tcdB antibodies can be candidate serologic markers for
CRC.
