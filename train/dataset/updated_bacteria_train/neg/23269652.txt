INTRODUCTION: Trans-fatty acids (TFAs) can be produced either from
bio-hydrogenation in the rumen of ruminants or by industrial hydrogenation. While
most of TFAs' effects from ruminants are poorly established, there is increasing 
evidence that high content of industrial TFAs may cause deleterious effects on
human health and life span.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Indeed, several epidemiological and experimental studies
strongly suggest that high content of most TFA isomers could represent a higher
risk of developing cardiovascular diseases by a mechanism that lowers the "good
HDL cholesterol" and raises the "bad LDL cholesterol."
RESULTS: With respect to the general precautionary principle and considering the 
existence of an international policy consensus regarding the need for public
health action, some industrialized countries, such as France, are still not
sufficiently involved in preventive strategies that aim to efficiently reduce
TFAs content and TFAs consumption and produce alternative healthier fat sources.
CONCLUSION: In this manuscript, we provide an overview about TFAs origins, their 
use and consumption among French population. We also discuss their potential
human health implications as well as the preventive and regulatory measures
undertaken in France.
