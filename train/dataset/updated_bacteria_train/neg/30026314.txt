Wnt signaling is key to many developmental, physiological, and disease processes 
in which cells seem able to discriminate between multiple Wnt ligands. This
selective Wnt recognition or "decoding" capacity has remained enigmatic because
Wnt/Frizzled interactions are largely incompatible with monospecific recognition.
Gpr124 and Reck enable brain endothelial cells to selectively respond to Wnt7. We
show that Reck binds with low micromolar affinity to the intrinsically disordered
linker region of Wnt7. Availability of Reck-bound Wnt7 for Frizzled signaling
relies on the interaction between Gpr124 and Dishevelled. Through polymerization,
Dishevelled recruits Gpr124 and the associated Reck-bound Wnt7 into dynamic
Wnt/Frizzled/Lrp5/6 signalosomes, resulting in increased local concentrations of 
Wnt7 available for Frizzled signaling. This work provides mechanistic insights
into the Wnt decoding capacities of vertebrate cells and unravels structural
determinants of the functional diversification of Wnt family members.
