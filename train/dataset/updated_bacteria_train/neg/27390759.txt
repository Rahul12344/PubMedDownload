Transfer of antigen presenting cells in vivo is a method used by immunologists to
examine the potency of antigen presentation by a selected population of cells.
This method is most commonly used to analyze presentation of protein antigens to 
MHC class I or II restricted T cells, but it can also be used for studies of
nonconventional antigens such as CD1-presented lipids. In a recent study focusing
on CD1d-restricted glycolipid antigen presentation to Natural Killer T cells, we 
compared antigen presenting properties of splenic B cells, CD8αPos dendritc cells
(DCs) and CD8αNeg DCs (Arora et al., 2014). This protocol describes the detailed 
method used for isolation of these cell populations, and their transfer into
recipient mice to analyze their antigen presenting properties.
