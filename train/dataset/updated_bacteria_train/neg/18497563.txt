The essential autophagy protein and haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor, Beclin
1, interacts with several cofactors (Ambra1, Bif-1, UVRAG) to activate the lipid 
kinase Vps34, thereby inducing autophagy. In normal conditions, Beclin 1 is bound
to and inhibited by Bcl-2 or the Bcl-2 homolog Bcl-X(L). This interaction
involves a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain in Beclin 1 and the BH3 binding groove
of Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L). Other proteins containing BH3 domains, called BH3-only
proteins, can competitively disrupt the interaction between Beclin 1 and
Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L) to induce autophagy. Nutrient starvation, which is a potent
physiologic inducer of autophagy, can stimulate the dissociation of Beclin 1 from
its inhibitors, either by activating BH3-only proteins (such as Bad) or by
posttranslational modifications of Bcl-2 (such as phosphorylation) that may
reduce its affinity for Beclin 1 and BH3-only proteins. Thus, anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family members and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins may participate in the
inhibition and induction of autophagy, respectively. This hitherto neglected
crosstalk between the core machineries regulating autophagy and apoptosis may
redefine the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in oncogenesis and tumor progression.
