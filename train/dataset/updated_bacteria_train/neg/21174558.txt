Invariant NK T (iNKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes that recognize
glycolipid antigens bound with the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d. iNKT cells
have potent immunoregulatory activities that can promote or suppress immune
responses during different pathological conditions. These immunoregulatory
properties can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes with cognate glycolipid
antigens, such as the marine sponge-derived glycosphingolipid
Î±-galactosylceramide. Preclinical studies have shown substantial promise for iNKT
cell-based treatments of infections, cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases. Translation of these preclinical studies to the clinic, while faced
with some obstacles, has already had some initial success. In this article, we
review the immunodulatory activities of iNKT cells and the potential for
developing iNKT cell-based prophylactic and curative therapies of human disease.
