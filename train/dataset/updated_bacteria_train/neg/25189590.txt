Presented here is a draft genome sequence for Staphylococcus agnetis CBMRN
20813338, isolated from a lactating dairy cow with subclinical mastitis. The
genome is approximately 2,416 kb and has 35.79% G+C content. Analysis of the
deduced open reading frame (ORF) set identified candidate virulence attributes in
addition to potential molecular targets for species identification.
