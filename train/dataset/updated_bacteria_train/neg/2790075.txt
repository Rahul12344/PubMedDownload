[DNA-methylase Sau 3A: isolation and various properties].

[Article in Russian]

Lebenka AIu, Rachkus IuA.

DNA-methylase Sau 3A has been isolated for the first time from Staphylococcus
aureus 3A cells and purified by column chromatography on phosphocellulose PII,
heparin-Sepharose and blue Sepharose. The purified enzyme methylates the GATC
sequence with the formation of GATm5C as can be evidenced from the protection of 
DNA from digestion with restrictases Sau 3A and Bam HI, the lack of the
C3H3-group incorporation into Sau 3A DNA-restricts and the formation of a single 
methylated base m5C. Sau 3A methylase modifies only a two-filament (but not
one-filament) DNA. Thus, methylase Sau 3A modifies the both DNA chains in the
recognition site during a single binding act. The 5-azacytidine-containing DNA
inhibits by 95% the activity of methylase Sau 3A. Ado-met is the single methyl
group donor for methylase Sau 3A. The presence of m6A in the recognition site
does not affect the activity of methylase Sau 3A. The practical recommendations
for the use of M. Sau 3A, alongside with M. Eco dam, for the study of dam
methylation by additional methylation of the DNA in vitro in the presence of
[methyl-3H]-S-adenosyl-methionine are given.
