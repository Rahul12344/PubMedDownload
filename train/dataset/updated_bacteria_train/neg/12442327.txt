A maturation-dependent change in phenotype and cytokine production from
relatively immature CD161(-) or CD161(+), IL-13(+)IL-4(+), IFN-gamma(-), to
mature CD161(+)CD56(+) IFN-gamma(+) cells occurs in primary human
alpha-galactosyl ceramide-reactive CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells
under the control of IL-12 and other monokines. Modulation of this process upon
alpha-galactosyl ceramide stimulation explains the opposite roles of NKT cells to
drive type 1 and type 2 immune responses. Because the same developmental changes 
occurred and were similarly regulated in T cells, the data establish that NKT
cells should no longer be considered a functionally unique regulatory subset.
However, the results of their analysis can be taken as a model for
immunotherapeutic approaches with T cells for which a nominal or surrogate
antigen is defined.
