Antral biopsy samples were taken from 147 patients undergoing gastroscopy.
Campylobacter pylori was cultivated from 100 of these patients. C. pylori was
isolated from 76% of the specimens showing any degree of histologic gastritis,
but from only 11% of specimens with completely normal histology. A questionnaire 
was completed on all patients and included demographic, epidemiologic and
clinical information. Sephardic origin, smoking, and a bad taste in the mouth
were more prevalent in the campylobacter-positive group. Previous use of
antibiotics was negatively associated with the presence of C. pylori.
Histologically confirmed gastritis was highly associated with the presence of C. 
pylori, especially in the moderate or severe grades in which 84% of biopsy
specimens were positive. C. pylori was also cultivated from 50% of patients with 
mild gastritis, in 88% of patients with duodenal ulcer and in 71% of patients
with gastric ulcer. The presence of C. pylori in 11% of normal specimens and the 
absence of C. pylori in 24% of specimens with gastritis further raises the
question of the exact role played by C. pylori in the etiology of gastritis.
