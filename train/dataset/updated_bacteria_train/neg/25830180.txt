Effect of hydrogen peroxide and/or Flavobacterium psychrophilum on the gills of
rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum).

Henriksen MM, Kania PW, Buchmann K, Dalsgaard I.

The immune response and morphological changes in the gills of rainbow trout fry
after immersion in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Flavobacterium psychrophilum or
combined exposure were examined. The gills were sampled 4, 48, 125 and 192 h
after exposure, and the regulation of expression of the following genes was
investigated using qPCR: IgT, IgM, CD8, CD4, MHC I, MHC II, IL-4/13A, TcR-β,
IL-10, IL-1β, IL-17, SAA and FoxP3. Bacteria were not observed in
haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained gill tissue, but the presence of F. psychrophilum 
16S rRNA was detected using qPCR. The 16S rRNA levels were correlated with gene
expression. Although pretreatment with H2O2 before immersion in F. psychrophilum 
did not significantly alter the amount of bacteria found in the gill, the immune 
response was influenced: exposure to F. psychrophilum resulted in a negative
correlation with expression of IL-17c1, MHC I and MHC II, while pretreatment with
H2O2 resulted in a positive correlation with IL-4/13A and IgM. Exposure to either
H2O2 or F. psychrophilum influenced the regulation of gene expression and damaged
tissue. Exposure to both combined altered the immune response to infection and
postponed healing of gill tissue.
