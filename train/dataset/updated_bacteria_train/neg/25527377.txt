The production of alkanes in a marine cyanobacterium possessing the α-olefin
biosynthesis pathway was achieved by introducing an exogenous alkane biosynthesis
pathway. Cyanobacterial hydrocarbons are synthesized via two separate pathways:
the acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase/aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase
(AAR/ADO) pathway for the alkane biosynthesis and the α-olefin synthase (OLS)
pathway for the α-olefin biosynthesis. Coexistence of these pathways has not yet 
been reported. In this study, the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.
NKBG15041c was shown to produce α-olefins similar to those of Synechococcus sp.
PCC7002 via the α-olefin biosynthesis pathway. The production of heptadecane in
Synechococcus sp. NKBG15041c was achieved by expressing the AAR/ADO pathway genes
from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The production yields of heptadecane in
Synechococcus sp. NKBG15041c varied with the expression level of the aar and ado 
genes. The maximal yield of heptadecane was 4.2 ± 1.2 μg/g of dried cell weight
in the transformant carrying a homologous promoter. Our results also suggested
that the effective activation of ADO may be more important for the enhancement of
alkane production by cyanobacteria.
