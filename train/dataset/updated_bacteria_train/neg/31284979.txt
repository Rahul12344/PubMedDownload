Lactobacilli rhamnosus has been characterized as a probiotic and plays an
important role in human health by stimulating the supplement of nutrients,
preventing the colonization of pathogens, and influencing the immune system. This
study investigated the anticancer activity of the three Lactobacillus rhamnosus
strains SHA111, SHA112, and SHA113 isolated from human breast milk. The cell-free
supernatant of a liquid culture of the three strains showed excellent antioxidant
activities against DPPH free radicals, superoxide anion radicals, and hydroxyl
radicals; furthermore, significant anticancer activity was found on cervix cancer
cells (HeLa) via cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis. RT-qPCR and western
blot analysis showed the induction of apoptosis was achieved via the
up-regulation of BAD, BAX, Caspase3, Caspase8, Caspase9, and down-regulation of
BCL-2 genes in HeLa cells. The results suggest that these strains have potential 
anticancer capability.
