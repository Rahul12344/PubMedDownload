The study included 200 healthy age and sex matched controls (120 healthy
volunteers and 80 healthy antenatal cases without any bad obstetric history) and 
300 cases comprising patients with bad obstetric history (BOH) 80 cases, seizure 
or encephalitis 50 cases, cervical lymphadenopathy 30 cases, congenital deformity
30 cases, HIV infected 80 cases and patients on long term immunosuppression 30
cases. Anti-toxoplasma IgG & IgM were measured by ELISA and individuals found
positive for anti Toxoplasma gondii IgM or with high titre of IgG were subjected 
to repeat testing after 3 weeks for rise in titre. True sero-prevalence of T
gondii infection was found to be 19% and it increased with increasing age in the 
population. 2.33% patients were found to have acute toxoplasma infection.
Statistical significance was seen only in patients with BOH and children born
with congenital abnormality.
