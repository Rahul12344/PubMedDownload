Some of micro-organisms are able to adapt themselves to hardest environmental
conditions. So, about cold conditions, most of them can still grow at very low
temperatures under 0 degree Celsius (nitrogen liquefied at -169 degrees C is the 
best way for preserving microbes). By another way some germs, qualified
psychrotophic bacteria, grow quite easily between 0 degree C and +10 degrees C.
Among these bacteria the author draw the attention to Listeria monocytogenes, a
germ contaminating often foodstuffs and being responsible of deep diseases by
eating food preserved in bad conditions (breaking off of refrigeration chain, bad
use of domestic refrigerators). Recommendations are laid down to avoid these
diseases, more particularly for frail consumers as immuno compromised adults.
