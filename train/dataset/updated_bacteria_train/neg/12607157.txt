PURPOSE: To investigate antibiotic utilization in a rural district of western
Nepal that is currently receiving azithromycin as part of a trachoma program and 
is being monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for
drug resistance.
METHODS: Antibiotic purchase receipts were collected for 3 months from all
medicine halls, pharmacies, and government sub-health posts in a sub-district of 
Western Nepal. Supplementary surveys of antibiotic sales were performed in
different seasons.
RESULTS: Macrolides account for 3.9% of total antibiotic use, far less than
quinolones, penicillins, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides.
CONCLUSIONS: If trachoma programs in Western Nepal generate transient macrolide
resistance in pneumococcus and other bacteria, the epidemiological impact may not
be great, as macrolides are not commonly used in the area.
