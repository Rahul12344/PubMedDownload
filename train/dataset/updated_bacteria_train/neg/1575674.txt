After multiple infections with S. enteritidis in humans and demonstration of S.
enteritidis in egg products, S. enteritidis (lysotype 6, plasmid profile 40)
could be isolated from organs of hens, anal swab tests of chicken, liquid manure,
egg shells and non pasteurized egg contents. Because of the largeness of the hen 
farm prophylactic vaccinations seemed to be advisable additionally to improvement
of the management and hygiene. A vaccine registered in 1987 for use in pigeons
and water fowl "Zoosal oral Dessau" was used. As a test three were vaccinated
three times and artificially infected. Cross immunity against S. enteritidis
could be demonstrated. In October 1987 all chicken of the farm were vaccinated
three times at the age of 4, 6 and 7 weeks; random samples were tested for
immunity and cross immunity. Until the end of the laying period immunity against 
S. typhimurium could be proven in 98% of the hens, against S. enteritidis in 95%.
