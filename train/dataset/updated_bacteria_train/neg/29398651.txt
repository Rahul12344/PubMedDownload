Pro-carcinogenic bacteria have the potential to initiate and/or promote colon
cancer, in part via immune mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Using
ApcMin mice colonized with the human pathobiont enterotoxigenic Bacteroides
fragilis (ETBF) as a model of microbe-induced colon tumorigenesis, we show that
the Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT) triggers a pro-carcinogenic, multi-step
inflammatory cascade requiring IL-17R, NF-κB, and Stat3 signaling in colonic
epithelial cells (CECs). Although necessary, Stat3 activation in CECs is not
sufficient to trigger ETBF colon tumorigenesis. Notably, IL-17-dependent NF-κB
activation in CECs induces a proximal to distal mucosal gradient of C-X-C
chemokines, including CXCL1, that mediates the recruitment of CXCR2-expressing
polymorphonuclear immature myeloid cells with parallel onset of ETBF-mediated
distal colon tumorigenesis. Thus, BFT induces a pro-carcinogenic signaling relay 
from the CEC to a mucosal Th17 response that results in selective NF-κB
activation in distal colon CECs, which collectively triggers
myeloid-cell-dependent distal colon tumorigenesis.
