BACKGROUND: Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the agent of Bacterial Cold Water
Disease and Rainbow Trout Fry Syndrome, two diseases leading to high mortality.
Pathogen detection is mainly carried out using cultures and more rapid and
sensitive methods are needed.
RESULTS: We describe a qPCR technique based on the single copy gene Î²'
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (rpoC). Its detection limit was 20 gene copies and
the quantification limit 103 gene copies per reaction. Tests on spiked spleens
with known concentrations of F. psychrophilum (106 to 101 cells per reaction)
showed no cross-reactions between the spleen tissue and the primers and probe.
Screening of water samples and spleens from symptomless and infected fishes
indicated that the pathogen was already present before the outbreaks, but F.
psychrophilum was only quantifiable in spleens from diseased fishes.
CONCLUSIONS: This qPCR can be used as a highly sensitive and specific method to
detect F. psychrophilum in different sample types without the need for culturing.
qPCR allows a reliable detection and quantification of F. psychrophilum in
samples with low pathogen densities. Quantitative data on F. psychrophilum
abundance could be useful to investigate risk factors linked to infections and
also as early warning system prior to potential devastating outbreak.
