The plasmid-borne arsenical resistance operon encodes an ATP-driven oxyanion pump
for the extrusion of the oxyanions arsenite, antimonite and arsenate from
bacterial cells. The catalytic component of the pump, the 63 kDa ArsA protein,
hydrolyses ATP in the presence of its anionic substrate antimonite (SbO2-). The
ATP analogue 5'-p-fluorosulphonylbenzoyladenosine was used to modify the ATP
binding site(s) of the ArsA protein. From sequence analysis there are two
potential nucleotide binding sites. Mutations were introduced into the N-terminal
site. Purified mutant proteins were catalytically inactive and incapable of
binding nucleotides. Conformational changes produced upon binding of substrates
to the ArsA protein were investigated by measuring the effects of substrates on
trypsin inactivation. The hydrophobic 45.5 kDa ArsB protein forms the membrane
anchor for the ArsA protein. The presence of the ArsA protein on purified inner
membrane can be detected immunologically. In the absence of the arsB gene no ArsA
is found on the membrane. Synthesis of the ArsB protein is limiting for formation
of the pump. Analysis of mRNA structure suggests a potential translational block 
to synthesis of the ArsB protein. Northern analysis of the ars message
demonstrates rapid degradation of the mRNA in the arsB region.
