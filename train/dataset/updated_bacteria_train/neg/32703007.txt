BACKGROUND: Throughout the inflammatory response that accompanies
atherosclerosis, autoreactive CD4+ T-helper cells accumulate in the
atherosclerotic plaque. Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB), the core protein of
low-density lipoprotein, is an autoantigen that drives the generation of
pathogenic T-helper type 1 (TH1) cells with proinflammatory cytokine secretion.
Clinical data suggest the existence of apoB-specific CD4+ T cells with an
atheroprotective, regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype in healthy individuals. Yet,
the function of apoB-reactive Tregs and their relationship with pathogenic TH1
cells remain unknown.
METHODS: To interrogate the function of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in
atherosclerosis, we used a novel tetramer of major histocompatibility complex II 
to track T cells reactive to the mouse self-peptide apo B978-993 (apoB+) at the
single-cell level.
RESULTS: We found that apoB+ T cells build an oligoclonal population in lymph
nodes of healthy mice that exhibit a Treg-like transcriptome, although only 21%
of all apoB+ T cells expressed the Treg transcription factor FoxP3 (Forkhead Box 
P3) protein as detected by flow cytometry. In single-cell RNA sequencing, apoB+ T
cells formed several clusters with mixed TH signatures that suggested overlapping
multilineage phenotypes with pro- and anti-inflammatory transcripts of TH1, T
helper cell type 2 (TH2), and T helper cell type 17 (TH17), and of
follicular-helper T cells. ApoB+ T cells were increased in mice and humans with
atherosclerosis and progressively converted into pathogenic TH1/TH17-like cells
with proinflammatory properties and only a residual Treg transcriptome. Plaque T 
cells that expanded during progression of atherosclerosis consistently showed a
mixed TH1/TH17 phenotype in single-cell RNA sequencing. In addition, we observed 
a loss of FoxP3 in a fraction of apoB+ Tregs in lineage tracing of hyperlipidemic
Apoe-/- mice. In adoptive transfer experiments, converting apoB+ Tregs failed to 
protect from atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate an unexpected mixed phenotype of
apoB-reactive autoimmune T cells in atherosclerosis and suggest an initially
protective autoimmune response against apoB with a progressive derangement in
clinical disease. These findings identify apoB autoreactive Tregs as a novel
cellular target in atherosclerosis.
