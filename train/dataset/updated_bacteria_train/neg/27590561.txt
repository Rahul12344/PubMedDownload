OBJECTIVES: Most are aware of pneumococcal infection as a complication of
splenectomy and the increased risk of severe invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 
in asplenic patients. However little is known of the current status of this
entity in a population with an active pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program for 
children.
METHODS: All IPD cases reported from 2000 to 2014 in Northern Alberta, Canada
were collected prospectively. Socio-demographic variables, clinical
characteristics, and IPD-related outcomes were compared between patients with and
without a spleen using the Student t-test, Chi-square test, or Fisher's exact
test, as appropriate.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 2435 patients with IPD (1.5%) were asplenic. Asplenic
patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation or
admission to the intensive care unit and had more complications (e.g., acute
kidney injury). However, in-hospital mortality rates were similar in those with
and without a spleen (19% vs. 16%, p=0.58). Pneumococcal serotype 22B was 33-fold
higher in asplenic patients compared to those with a spleen.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IPD, those who are asplenic have a more severe
infection than those with a spleen; however, the mortality rate is not
significantly different. The reason for the predominance of serotype 22B requires
further investigation and if replicated may warrant attention to current
vaccination strategies.
