The activity of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was found in the
culture supernatant of mouse parenchymal liver cell fractions in a bone marrow
colony-forming assay. The activity of an M-CSF-like substance purified by a
four-step procedure was neutralized by goat anti-mouse M-CSF antiserum. M-CSF
mRNA was detected in cellular RNA prepared from cultured parenchymal liver cell
fractions by Northern blot analysis and also in cultured parenchymal liver cells 
by in situ hybridization. These results indicate that parenchymal liver cells
have the capacity to produce M-CSF. We discuss the role of M-CSF in
hematopoiesis, the immune response, and other biological phenomena.
