Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) have attracted considerable attention as regulators of
metabolism over the past decade. However, the physiological functions and
molecular mechanisms of SIRT7 are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that
Sirt7 knockout mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced fatty liver, obesity,
and glucose intolerance, and that hepatic triglyceride accumulation was also
attenuated in liver-specific Sirt7 knockout mice. Hepatic SIRT7 positively
regulated the protein level of TR4/TAK1, a nuclear receptor involved in lipid
metabolism, and as a consequence activated TR4 target genes to increase fatty
acid uptake and triglyceride synthesis/storage. Biochemical studies revealed that
the DDB1-CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1)/damage-specific DNA binding protein 1
(DDB1)/cullin 4B (CUL4B) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex interacted with TR4, leading
to its degradation, while binding of SIRT7 to the DCAF1/DDB1/CUL4B complex
inhibited the degradation of TR4. In conclusion, we propose that hepatic SIRT7
controls lipid metabolism in liver by regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway.
