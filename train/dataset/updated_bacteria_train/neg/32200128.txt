OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report the draft genome sequences of two
multidrug-resistant bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron F9-2 and Escherichia
coli 09-02E) isolated from stool samples of a healthy resident in Vietnam.
METHODS: Genome sequences were determined using MiSeq and MinION platforms.
Genome assembly was performed using Platanus Assembler v.1.2.4 and Canu v.1.7.
The DDBJ Fast Annotation and Submission Tool were used for genome annotation.
RESULTS: The genome of B. thetaiotaomicron F9-2 comprised 6 283 774 bp with a GC 
content of 42.7% and 4802 protein coding sequences (CDS), whereas the genome of
E. coli 09-02E comprised 5 246 320 bp with a GC content of 50.6% and 4991 protein
CDS. Both strains harboured common antimicrobial resistance genes, such as those 
for sulfonamides (sul2) and aminoglycosides (strA, strB). However, the
sul2-strA-strB cassette was located on the chromosome of B. thetaiotaomicron
F9-2, whereas it was located on a plasmid in E. coli 09-02E. These genes were
flanked by different insertion sequences.
CONCLUSION: Considering their diversities in the human gut resistome, these
strains would be of considerable interest for detailed comparative genomic
analysis. Notably, the same sul2 cassette was found in facultative and obligate
anaerobic bacterial isolates (resident in humans). However, the different
location of the cassette indicates a possible mechanism of gene transfer among
gut microbes.
