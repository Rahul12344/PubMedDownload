The critical role of peptide antigen-specific T cells in controlling
mycobacterial infections is well documented in natural resistance and
vaccine-induced immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, many other 
populations of leukocytes contribute to innate and adaptive immunity against
mycobacteria. Among these, non-conventional T cells recognizing lipid antigens
presented by the CD1 antigen presentation system have attracted particular
interest. In this chapter, we review the basic immunobiology and potential
antimycobacterial properties of a subset of CD1-restricted T cells that have come
to be known as Natural Killer T cells. This group of lipid reactive T cells is
notable for its high level of conservation between humans and mice, thus enabling
a wide range of highly informative studies in mouse models. As reviewed below,
NKT cells appear to have subtle but potentially significant activities in the
host response to mycobacteria. Importantly, they also provide a framework for
investigations into other types of lipid antigen-specific T cells that may be
more abundant in larger mammals such as humans.
