The aim of this study was to verify the effect of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2 on 
hepatic nucleotidases and on the concentration of purines in mice infected by
Toxoplasma gondii. The animals were divided into four groups: Group A
(uninfected), Group B (uninfected and treated with (PhSe)2), Group C (infected), 
and Group D (infected and treated with (PhSe)2). The inoculation (groups C and D)
was performed with 50 cysts of T. gondii (ME-49 strain). Mice from groups B and D
were treated with 5 μmol kg-1 of (PhSe)2. Liver tissue from infected mice showed 
less severe inflammation, elevated ATP/ADO ratio, elevated NTPDase,
5'nucleotidase, and ADA activities compared to the uninfected group (Group A;
P < 0.05). However, infected and treated mice showed decreased ATP levels and
elevated ADO levels, as well as higher NTPDase and 5'nucleotidase activities and 
decreased ADA activity in the hepatic tissue compared to the infected group
(P < 0.05). Moreover, the (PhSe)2 treatment of infected mice reduced the hepatic 
inflammation and showed an immunomodulatory effect on ectonucleotidases of
hepatic lymphocytes, which it returned to basal levels. Therefore, chronic
infection by T. gondii induces hepatic inflammation in mice, and it is possible
that purine levels and nucleotidase activities in hepatic tissue are related to
the pathogenesis of the infection in this tissue. The treatment with (PhSe)2 was 
able to reverse the hepatic inflammation in mice chronically infected, possibly
due to the modulation of purinergic enzymes that produce an anti-inflammatory
profile through the purinergic system in the liver tissue.
