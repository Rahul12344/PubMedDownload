Natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like lymphocytes that rapidly secrete
large amounts of effector cytokines upon activation. Recognition of alpha-linked 
glycolipids presented by CD1d leads to the production of IL-4, IFN-gamma, or
both, while direct activation by the synergistic action of IL-12 and IL-18 leads 
to IFN-gamma production only. We previously reported that in vitro cultured
dendritic cells can modulate NKT cell activation and, using intravital
fluorescence laser scanning microscopy, we reported that the potent stimulation
of NKT cells results in arrest within hepatic sinusoids. In this study, we
examine the relationship between murine NKT cell patrolling and activation. We
report that NKT cell arrest results from activation driven by limiting doses of a
bacteria-derived weak agonist, galacturonic acid-containing glycosphingolipid, or
a synthetic agonist, alpha-galactosyl ceramide. Interestingly, NKT cell arrest
also results from IL-12 and IL-18 synergistic activation. Thus, innate cytokines 
and natural microbial TCR agonists trigger sinusoidal NKT cell arrest and an
effector response.
