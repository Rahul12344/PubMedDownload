An otherwise healthy 45-year-old man presented to our emergency department
holding his left arm in abduction and external rotation. He reported pain in his 
left shoulder and chest for the preceding 10 days that had become much worse over
the last 48 h and was eased only by holding his arm in this position. The CT of
the chest revealed soft tissue swelling around the left sternoclavicular joint
consistent with sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis with significant
inflammatory involvement of the medial component of the left pectoralis major
muscle. The patient was taken to theatre for washout of the left sternoclavicular
joint and is currently recovering well at home on intravenous antibiotics.
