The role played by zinc in biology is now better known, and numerous biochemical 
mechanisms, such as immunity or actions on several hormones and more than 200
enzymes, have proved to be zinc-dependent. Thus, many functions are disturbed
when this trace metal is deficient, including, for example, taste and appetite,
cell multiplication, growth, pregnancy, fertility, defence against bacteria and
brain functions. Zinc intake has been found to be unexcessive and indeed, at the 
limit of sufficiency in the French population. Groups at risk, such as neonates, 
growing children, pregnant women and elderly people, should have a higher zinc
intake provided by dietary measures or supplementation. Zinc supplementation has 
been shown to exert a beneficial effect in randomized studies concerning
children's growth, acne, old people's immunity or low female fertility. Such
supplementation must be balanced and given in moderate doses since zinc interacts
with other foodstuffs, and an excess of zinc can be as bad as its deficiency in
our nutrition.
