PURPOSE: alpha-Galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), which is a specific ligand for 
CD1d restricted variable-alpha14chain natural killer T cells, has an important
role in host defense against a range of microbial infections. We examined whether
alpha-GalCer mediates bacterial clearance in a murine urinary tract infection
(UTI) model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The murine UTI model was established by intravesical
inoculation of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, followed by clamping the distal end of the urethra of
C57BL/6 female mice for 4 hours. The antibacterial effect of alpha-GalCer was
assessed by comparing the number of cfu/gm kidney tissue 4 days after bacterial
inoculation. The prophylactic effect of alpha-GalCer was examined by
administrating 3 doses of intraperitoneal alpha-GalCer on alternate days 24 hours
before E. coli inoculation. The therapeutic effect of alpha-GalCer was tested by 
the administration of 2 doses of intraperitoneal alpha-GalCer after bacterial
inoculation. To assess cytokine induction by alpha-GalCer serum levels of
interleukin-12, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured by
cytometric bead array assay.
RESULTS: When administered before bacterial inoculation, alpha-GalCer showed a
strong prophylactic antibacterial effect. alpha-GalCer also showed a marked
antibacterial effect on preestablished mice UTI caused by E. coli, P. aeruginosa 
and methicillin resistant S. aureus. alpha-GalCer induced a significantly higher 
level of interleukin-12, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
compared with control glycolipids.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a significant role for alpha-GalCer in
regulating antibacterial functions by activating natural killer T cells in the
murine UTI model.
