Susceptibility and immunity to Vibrio anguillarum in post-hatching rainbow trout 
fry, Salmo gairdneri Richardson 1836.

Tatner MF, Horne MT.

Rainbow trout fry were tested for their susceptibility to experimental infection 
with Vibrio anguillarum, and their ability to mount an immune response against
it, from the age of 2 weeks post-hatch onwards. Bath challenges were ineffective 
in inducing vibriosis until 6-8 weeks post-hatch, and then only low levels of
specific mortality ensued, even at very high doses. However, at the earliest age 
tested, 7 weeks post-hatch, the fry were susceptible to infection by an
intraperitoneal injection with live organisms. Protective immunity was evident in
fry vaccinated by direct immersion as early as 2 weeks post-hatch (at an average 
weight of 0.14g), when tested by intraperitoneal challenge. By the time the fry
reached 0.5g (10 weeks after hatching), protection levels had reached 50% for
direct immersion vaccination and 100% for intraperitoneal vaccination. An oral
vaccination, from first feeding onwards, proved ineffective in inducing immunity.
The results are discussed in relation to the onset and maturation of
immunological competence in rainbow trout.
