BACKGROUND: Cancer-related inflammation is recognized as a driver for tumor
progression and chemokines are important players in both inflammation and the
progression of many cancer types. CXC chemokines, especially CXCL8, have been
implicated in melanoma growth and metastasis, while less is known for their roles
in drug resistance.
METHODS: We generated drug-resistant cells by continuous exposure to
chemotherapeutic drugs and analyzed the mechanism(s) of therapy resistance in
malignant melanoma.
RESULTS: We report chemotherapies induced upregulation of a variety of chemokines
in the CXCR1/CXCR2 network by an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Notably, analysis of 
the drug-resistant melanoma cell line selected after prolonged exposure to
chemotherapeutic drug dacarbazine revealed higher levels of CXCL8 and CXCR2
compared with parent cells as a signature of drug resistance. CXCR2
neutralization markedly improved sensitivity to dacarbazine in melanoma cells.
CONCLUSION: These data provide insights into what drives melanoma cells to
survive after chemotherapy treatment, thus pointing to strategies for developing 
combined drug therapies for combating the problem of chemotherapy resistance in
melanoma.
