A chimeric transport protein was made by expression of a fusion of the arsB genes
from Escherichia coli plasmid R773 and Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258. The
two genes were fused to encode a functional protein with first eight membrane
spanning alpha-helices of the S. aureus and the last four helices of the E. coli 
protein. The hybrid protein provided arsenite resistance and transport. When an
arsA gene was expressed in trans with the ArsB proteins encoded by the R773,
pI258 and fusion genes, arsenite efflux was dependent on chemical but not
electrochemical energy. The Ars system is hypothesized to be a novel transport
system that functions as a primary ATP-driven pump or a secondary carrier,
depending on the subunit composition of the complex.
