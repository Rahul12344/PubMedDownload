Whooping cough is a re-emerging respiratory tract infection. It has become clear 
that there is a need for better understanding of protective immune responses and 
variation between Bordetella pertussis strains to aid the development of improved
vaccines. In order to survive in the host, B. pertussis has evolved mechanisms to
evade complement-mediated killing, including the ability to bind
complement-regulatory proteins. Here we evaluate the variation in interactions
with the complement system among recently isolated strains. Isolates whose
genomes appear highly similar and cluster together on a SNP-based dendrogram were
found to vary significantly in resistance to complement-mediated killing and in
the deposition of C3b/iC3b, C5b-9 and C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). The key
role of Vag8 as a receptor for C1-INH was confirmed and its expression was shown 
to vary in a panel of isolates. A Vag8 knockout mutant showed increased
sensitivity to complement-mediated killing. Antibodies in convalescent sera
blocked C1-INH binding to B. pertussis and may play an important role in natural 
immunity.
