Interleukin-8 (IL-8) activates neutrophils via the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and 
CXCR2. However, the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis are frequently
colonized by bacterial pathogens, despite the presence of large numbers of
neutrophils and IL-8. Here we show that IL-8 promotes bacterial killing by
neutrophils through CXCR1 but not CXCR2. Unopposed proteolytic activity in the
airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis cleaved CXCR1 on neutrophils and
disabled their bacterial-killing capacity. These effects were protease
concentration-dependent and also occurred to a lesser extent in individuals with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Receptor cleavage induced the release of
glycosylated CXCR1 fragments that were capable of stimulating IL-8 production in 
bronchial epithelial cells via Toll-like receptor 2. In vivo inhibition of
proteases by inhalation of alpha1-antitrypsin restored CXCR1 expression and
improved bacterial killing in individuals with cystic fibrosis. The cleavage of
CXCR1, the functional consequences of its cleavage, and the identification of
soluble CXCR1 fragments that behave as bioactive components represent a new
pathophysiologic mechanism in cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases.
