Genetics of taste and smell: poisons and pleasures.

Eating is dangerous. While food contains nutrients and calories that animals need
to produce heat and energy, it may also contain harmful parasites, bacteria, or
chemicals. To guide food selection, the senses of taste and smell have evolved to
alert us to the bitter taste of poisons and the sour taste and off-putting smell 
of spoiled foods. These sensory systems help people and animals to eat
defensively, and they provide the brake that helps them avoid ingesting foods
that are harmful. But choices about which foods to eat are motivated by more than
avoiding the bad; they are also motivated by seeking the good, such as fat and
sugar. However, just as not everyone is equally capable of sensing toxins in
food, not everyone is equally enthusiastic about consuming high-fat, high-sugar
foods. Genetic studies in humans and experimental animals strongly suggest that
the liking of sugar and fat is influenced by genotype; likewise, the abilities to
detect bitterness and the malodors of rotting food are highly variable among
individuals. Understanding the exact genes and genetic differences that affect
food intake may provide important clues in obesity treatment by allowing
caregivers to tailor dietary recommendations to the chemosensory landscape of
each person.
