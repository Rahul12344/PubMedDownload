Enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan represent
traditionally a collection of highly selective targets for novel antibacterial
drug design. Four members of the bacterial Mur ligase family-MurC, MurD, MurE and
MurF-are involved in the intracellular steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis,
catalyzing the synthesis of the peptide moiety of the Park's nucleotide. In our
previous virtual screening campaign, a chemical class of benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic
acid 2,5-dimethylpyrrole derivatives exhibiting dual MurD/MurE inhibition
properties was discovered. In the present study we further investigated this
class of compounds by performing inhibition assays on all four Mur ligases
(MurC-MurF). Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of one of
the initially discovered compound 1 were performed to explore its geometry as
well as its energetic behavior based on the Linear Interaction Energy (LIE)
method. Further in silico virtual screening (VS) experiments based on the parent 
active compound 1 were conducted to optimize the discovered series. Selected hits
were assayed against all Escherichia coli MurC-MurF enzymes in biochemical
inhibition assays and molecules 10-14 containing benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid
2,5-dimethylpyrrole coupled with five member-ring rhodanine moiety were found to 
be multiple inhibitors of the whole MurC-MurF cascade of bacterial enzymes in the
micromolar range. Steady-state kinetics studies suggested this class to act as
competitive inhibitors of the MurD enzyme towards d-Glu. These compounds
represent novel valuable starting point in the development of novel antibacterial
agents.
