Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are highly effective in
preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), but deaths due to IPD still
occur. We aimed to describe children who died of IPD since PCV introduction in
England and Wales.
Methods: Public Health England conducts enhanced IPD surveillance in England and 
Wales. IPD cases in PCV-eligible children aged <5 years (born since 4 September
2004 and diagnosed between 4 September 2006 and 3 September 2014) were actively
followed up by postal questionnaires and, for fatal cases, detailed information
was requested prospectively from multiple sources.
Results: During the 8-year period, there were 3146 IPD cases and 150 IPD-related 
deaths (case fatality rate, 4.8%). Overall, 132 isolates from fatal cases were
serotyped (88%) and 35 distinct serotypes were identified, with no serotype
predominance. Most deaths occurred in children aged <1 year (88/150 [59%]) and
1-year-olds (36/150 [24%]). One-third (53/150 [35%]) had a known risk factor for 
IPD. Clinical presentation varied with age but not by serotypes in the different 
conjugate vaccines. Meningitis was diagnosed in nearly half the fatal cases
(71/150 [47%]). The IPD-related mortality rate declined after 7-valent PCV
introduction from 1.25/100000 children in 2006-2007 to 0.60/100000 in 2009-2010, 
with a further reduction following 13-valent PCV introduction from April 2010 to 
0.39/100000 in 2013-2014 (14 deaths; incidence rate ratio, 0.31 [95% confidence
interval, .16-.61]; P = .0003), when most deaths were due to nonvaccine serotypes
or in neonates.
Conclusions: Most fatal IPD cases are currently not vaccine-preventable.
Additional strategies will be required to reduce childhood pneumococcal deaths in
countries with established pneumococcal vaccination programs.
