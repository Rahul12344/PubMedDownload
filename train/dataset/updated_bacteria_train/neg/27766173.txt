Acinetobacter baumannii is a ubiquitous pathogen that has emerged as a major
cause of healthcare-associated infections at Ladoke Akintola University Teaching 
Hospital. Isolates were assayed according to standard protocol. The isolates were
subjected to molecular techniques to detect blaOXA, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV 
genes in strains of the A. baumannii isolates. The prevalence of A. baumannii was
8.5% and was most prevalent among patients in the age group 51-60 (36%); the male
patients (63.6%) were more infected than their female counterparts. Patients
(72.7%) in the intensive care unit (ICU) were most infected with this organism.
The isolates showed 100% resistance to both amikacin and ciprofloxacin and 90.9% 
to both ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, while resistance to the other antibiotics
used in this study were: piperacillin (81.8%), imipenem (72.7%), gentamycin
(72.2%), and meropenem (63.6%). None of the isolates was, however, resistant to
colistin. PCR results showed that blaOXA, blaTEM, and blaCTX-M genes were
positive in some isolates, while blaSHV was not detected in any of the isolates. 
This study has revealed that the strains of A. baumannii isolated are multiple
drug resistant. Regular monitoring, judicious prescription, and early detection
of resistance to these antibiotics are, therefore, necessary to check further
dissemination of the organism.
