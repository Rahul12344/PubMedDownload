CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells are important for host defense
against a variety of microbial pathogens. How and when these T cells become
activated physiologically during infection remains unknown. Our data support a
model in which NKT cells use a unique activation mechanism not requiring their
recognition of microbial antigens. Instead, weak responses to CD1d-presented self
antigens were amplified by interleukin 12 made by dendritic cells in response to 
microbial products, resulting in potent interferon-gamma secretion. NKT cells
were among the first lymphocytes to respond during Salmonella typhimurium
infection, and their activation in vivo also depended on interleukin 12 and CD1d 
recognition. We propose this mechanism of activation as a major pathway
responsible for the rapid activation of NKT cells in different microbial
infections.
