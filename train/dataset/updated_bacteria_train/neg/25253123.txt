BACKGROUND: In acute cough patients, impaired lung function as present in chronic
lung conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are 
often thought to negatively influence course of disease, but clear evidence is
lacking.
AIMS: To investigate the influence of lung function abnormalities on course of
disease and response to antibiotic therapy in primary care patients with acute
cough.
METHODS: A total of 3,104 patients with acute cough (⩽28 days) were included in a
prospective observational study with a within-nested trial, of which 2,427
underwent spirometry 28-35 days after inclusion. Influence of the lung function
abnormalities fixed obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced
vital capacity (FVC) ratio <0.7) and bronchodilator responsiveness (FEV1 increase
of ⩾12% or 200 ml after 400 μg salbutamol) on symptom severity, duration and
worsening were evaluated using uni- and multivariable regression models.
Antibiotic use was defined as the reported use of antibiotics ⩾5 days in the
first week. Interaction terms were calculated to investigate modifying effects of
lung function on antibiotic effect.
RESULTS: The only significant association was the effect of severe airway
obstruction on symptom severity on days 2-4 (difference=0.31, 95% confidence
interval (CI)=0.03-0.60, P=0.03). No evidence of a differential effect of lung
function on the effect of antibiotics was found. Prior use of inhaled steroids
was associated with a 30% slower resolution of symptoms rated 'moderately bad' or
worse (hazard ratio=0.75, 95% CI=0.63-0.90, P=0.00).
CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with acute cough, lung function abnormalities were
neither significantly associated with course of disease nor did they modify the
effect of antibiotics.
