Dbp2p, a member of the large family of DEAD-box proteins and a yeast homolog of
human p68, was shown to interact with Upf1p, an essential component of the
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Dbp2p:Upf1p interaction occurs within a
large conserved region in the middle of Upf1p that is largely distinct from its
Nmd2p and Sup35/45p interaction domains. Deletion of DBP2, or point mutations
within its highly conserved DEAD-box motifs, increased the abundance of
nonsense-containing transcripts, leading us to conclude that Dbp2p also functions
in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Dbp2p, like Upf1p, acts before or at
decapping, is predominantly cytoplasmic, and associates with polyribosomes.
Interestingly, Dbp2p also plays an important role in rRNA processing. In
dbp2Delta cells, polyribosome profiles are deficient in free 60S subunits and the
mature 25S rRNA is greatly reduced. The ribosome biogenesis phenotype, but not
the mRNA decay function, of dbp2Delta cells can be complemented by the human p68 
gene. We propose a unifying model in which Dbp2p affects both nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay and rRNA processing by altering rRNA structure, allowing specific
processing events in one instance and facilitating dissociation of the
translation termination complex in the other.
