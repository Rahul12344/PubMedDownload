The metabolism and generation of bioactive lipid mediators are key events in the 
exertion of the beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids in the
regulation of allergic inflammation. Here, we found that dietary linseed oil,
which contains high amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) dampened allergic
rhinitis through eosinophilic production of 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid
(15-HEPE), a metabolite of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Lipidomic analysis
revealed that 15-HEPE was particularly accumulated in the nasal passage of
linseed oil-fed mice after the development of allergic rhinitis with the
increasing number of eosinophils. Indeed, the conversion of EPA to 15-HEPE was
mediated by the 15-lipoxygenase activity of eosinophils. Intranasal injection of 
15-HEPE dampened allergic symptoms by inhibiting mast cell degranulation, which
was mediated by the action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.
These findings identify 15-HEPE as a novel EPA-derived, and eosinophil-dependent 
anti-allergic metabolite, and provide a preventive and therapeutic strategy
against allergic rhinitis.
