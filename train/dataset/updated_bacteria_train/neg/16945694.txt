BACKGROUND: This study sought to establish a benchmark of resistant organism
rates among a cohort of regional hospitals.
METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions were
used to standardize the methodology for obtaining rates per 1000 patient days of 
nosocomial infection and colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and nosocomial
infection with Clostridium difficile (CDIF). Only newly acquired nosocomial cases
were counted. Data were reported as individual hospital control charts and as
cohorted aggregate data. VHA East Coast Infection Control Professionals from 32
hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were involved.
RESULTS: Benchmarks were established with pooled mean rates for each cohort.
During the observational period, a statistically significant downward trend was
observed for VRE and MRSA (P = .02 and .0007, respectively), and an upward trend 
was observed for CDIF (P = .0256).
CONCLUSION: Benchmarks were established to compare nosocomial MRSA, VRE, and CDIF
rates. Although significant changes in rates were observed, no attempt was made
to establish a causal relationship between infection control practices and
observed rates. However, a secondary gain was achieved through sharing best
practices.
