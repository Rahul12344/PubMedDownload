The primary screening of hybridoma clones secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 
requires the testing of a large number of hybridoma culture supernatants within a
short time and is very labor-intensive. In addition, the type of antigen and its 
location in the cell have to be considered when selecting the appropriate
screening procedure, but relatively few reagents are available for analyzing
these molecules. We have developed an intracellular and cell surface ELISA
technique for screening hybridoma supernatants that hastens the screening
procedure of a large number of clones in a short period of time, as the
supernatants of fused cells grown in 96-well plates are used directly in the
assay. This novel screening technique is rapid, sensitive, specific, and
applicable to MAbs specific for a wide variety of intracellular and/or cell
surface proteins.
