Thiamethoxam is a broad-spectrum pesticide widely used in agricultural practice
throughout the world. Worryingly, this pesticide is considered a potential
contaminant on the surface and underground water, being a significant risk to
aquatic ecosystems and humans. In this sense, we decided to evaluate the activity
of enzymes belonging to purinergic system, which is linked with regulation of
extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides, as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
adenosine (Ado) molecules involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory
responses. Such as the neurotoxic effects of thiamethoxam remain poorly
understood, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether purinergic signaling
may be considered a potential target of thiamethoxam-induced neurotoxicity in
silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). Brain ectonucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase (ATP as substrate) and 5'-nucleotidases activities were
inhibited at 3.75 µg L-1 after 24 h of exposure and at 1.125 and 3.75 µg L-1
after 96 h of exposure compared with the control group. On the other hand, brain 
adenosine deaminase activity was stimulated at 3.75 µg L-1 after 24 h of exposure
and at 1.125 and 3.75 µg L-1 after 96 h of exposure compared with the control
group. Brain ATP levels increased at 3.75 µg L-1 after 24 h of exposure and at
1.125 and 3.75 µg L-1 after 96 h of exposure compared with the control group,
while the Ado levels decreased. The enzymatic activity of the purinergic
signaling did not return to control levels after a 48-h recovery period,
revealing the potential neurotoxic effects of thiamethoxam. In summary, the brain
purinergic signaling may be considered a potential target for
thiamethoxam-induced neurotoxicity in silver catfish.
