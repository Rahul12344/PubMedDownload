Erythromycin and josamycin are the antibiotics of choice in the treatment of
pregnant women with Chlamydia infection. On the basis of differing
recommendations in the literature regarding treatment period and dosage, two
groups of pregnant women were treated with josamycin according to different
dosage schedules: Group A: 170 patients treated with 2 x 500 mg daily for 12
days. Group B: 120 patients treated with 3 x 500 mg daily for 8 days. The
diagnosis was confirmed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies.
Non-responding patients were treated again with a similar dose. 17% of the
patients in group A and 9.1% in group B were still positive for Chlamydia after
the first course of treatment. After a second course, 13.6% of group A and none
of group B showed positive controls. Failures of therapy after the first
treatment course can be attributed to errors in dosage or re-infection, whereas
failures after the second course must be due to bad compliance. Our results
suggest that pregnant women with Chlamydia infection are most efficiently treated
with high dosages of josamycin over a short period of time.
