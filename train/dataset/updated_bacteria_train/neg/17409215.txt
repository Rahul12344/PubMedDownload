Addition of neuA, the gene encoding N-acylneuraminate cytidylyl transferase,
increases the discriminatory ability of the consensus sequence-based scheme for
typing Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 strains.

The standard sequence-based method for the typing of Legionella pneumophila
serogroup 1 strains was extended by using the gspA and neuA alleles. The use of
neuA as a seventh allele for typing significantly increased the index of
discrimination calculated for a panel of unrelated strains (from 0.932 to 0.963) 
and subdivided some known large common complexes (e.g., 1,4,3,1,1,1). This
modification to the standard method is proposed as the method of choice in the
epidemiological investigation of L. pneumophila infections.
