Extensive mutations of lankacidin synthase genes were carried out to analyze the 
modular-iterative mixed polyketide biosynthesis of lankacidin. Three
ketoreductase domains (lkcC-KR, lkcF-KR1, and lkcF-KR2) were inactivated by
in-frame deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of their active sites. The
mutants ceased or diminished lankacidin production, indicating that the three KR 
domains are functional in lankacidin biosynthesis. However, all of the KR mutants
failed to accumulate the expected unreduced metabolites. Mutational analysis of
two tandemly aligned acyl carrier protein domains (lkcC-ACP1 and lkcC-ACP2)
revealed that either ACP is sufficient for lankacidin production. Disruption and 
complementation experiments on three unique genes/domain (lkcD for
acyltransferase, lkcB for dehydratase, and lkcC-MT for a C-methyltransferase
domain) suggested that their gene products function iteratively during lankacidin
biosynthesis.
