Simulation of in vivo cellular processes with the reaction-diffusion master
equation (RDME) is a computationally expensive task. Our previous software
enabled simulation of inhomogeneous biochemical systems for small bacteria over
long time scales using the MPD-RDME method on a single GPU. Simulations of larger
eukaryotic systems exceed the on-board memory capacity of individual GPUs, and
long time simulations of modest-sized cells such as yeast are impractical on a
single GPU. We present a new multi-GPU parallel implementation of the MPD-RDME
method based on a spatial decomposition approach that supports dynamic load
balancing for workstations containing GPUs of varying performance and memory
capacity. We take advantage of high-performance features of CUDA for peer-to-peer
GPU memory transfers and evaluate the performance of our algorithms on
state-of-the-art GPU devices. We present parallel e ciency and performance
results for simulations using multiple GPUs as system size, particle counts, and 
number of reactions grow. We also demonstrate multi-GPU performance in
simulations of the Min protein system in E. coli. Moreover, our multi-GPU
decomposition and load balancing approach can be generalized to other
lattice-based problems.
