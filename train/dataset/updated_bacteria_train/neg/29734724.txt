Of the many ways that plants interact with microbes, three aspects are
highlighted in this issue: interactions where the plant benefits from the
microbes, interactions where the plant suffers, and interactions where the plant 
serves as habitat for microbial communities. In this editorial, the fourteen
articles published in the Special Issue Plant⁻Microbe Interaction 2017 are
summarized and discussed as part of the global picture of the current
understanding of plant-microbe interactions.
