A prominent subset of the hepatic innate immune system is
alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer)-reactive, (CD4(+) and CD4(-)CD8(-))
CD1d-restricted NKT cells. We investigated in C57BL/6 (B6) mice which hepatic
cell type stimulates hepatic NKT cell activation. Surface expression of CD1d but 
not CD40, CD80, or CD86 costimulator molecules was detected in hepatocytes.
Pulsed in vitro or in vivo with alphaGalCer, hepatocytes triggered IL-4 release
by liver NKT cells but required exogenous IL-12 to trigger IFN-gamma release by
NKT cells. Liver dendritic cells (DC) isolated from nontreated mice showed low
surface expression of MHC, CD1d, and CD40, CD80, or CD86 costimulator molecules
that were strikingly up-regulated after alphaGalCer injection. Although liver
CD11c(+) DC displayed lower CD1d surface expression than hepatocytes, they were
potent stimulators of IFN-gamma and IL-4 release by liver NKT when pulsed with
alphaGalCer in vitro or in vivo. Liver DC are thus potent stimulators of
proinflammatory cytokine release by NKT cells, are activated themselves in the
process of NKT cell activation, and express an activated phenotype after the NKT 
cell population is eliminated following alphaGalCer stimulation.
