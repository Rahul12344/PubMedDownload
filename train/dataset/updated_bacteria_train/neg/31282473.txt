The structure of BgaR, a transcriptional regulator of the lactose operon in
Clostridium perfringens, has been solved by SAD phasing using a mercury
derivative. BgaR is an exquisite sensor of lactose, with a binding affinity in
the low-micromolar range. This sensor and regulator has been captured bound to
lactose and to lactulose as well as in a nominal apo form, and was compared with 
AraC, another saccharide-binding transcriptional regulator. It is shown that the 
saccharides bind in the N-terminal region of a jelly-roll fold, but that part of 
the saccharide is exposed to bulk solvent. This differs from the classical AraC
saccharide-binding site, which is mostly sequestered from the bulk solvent. The
structures of BgaR bound to lactose and to lactulose highlight how specific and
nonspecific interactions lead to a higher binding affinity of BgaR for lactose
compared with lactulose. Moreover, solving multiple structures of BgaR in
different space groups, both bound to saccharides and unbound, verified that the 
dimer interface along a C-terminal helix is similar to the dimer interface
observed in AraC.
