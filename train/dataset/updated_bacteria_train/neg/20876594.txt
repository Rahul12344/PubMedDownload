INTRODUCTION: Neonatal infection is an important cause of morbidity and
mortality. Neonatal infection surveillance networks are necessary for defining
the epidemiology of infections and monitoring changes over time.
DESIGN: Prospective multicentre surveillance using a web-based database.
SETTING: 12 English neonatal units.
PARTICIPANTS: Newborns admitted in 2006-2008, with positive blood, cerebrospinal 
fluid or urine culture and treated with antibiotics for at least 5 days.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence, age at infection, pathogens and antibiotic resistance
profiles.
RESULTS: With the inclusion of coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS), the
incidence of all neonatal infection was 8/1000 live births and 71/1000 neonatal
admissions (2007-2008). The majority of infections occurred in premature (<37
weeks) and low birthweight (<2500 g) infants (82% and 81%, respectively). The
incidence of early onset sepsis (EOS; ≤48 h of age) was 0.9/1000 live births and 
9/1000 neonatal admissions, and group B Streptococcus (58%) and Escherichia coli 
(18%) were the most common organisms. The incidence of late onset sepsis (LOS;
>48 h of age) was 3/1000 live births and 29/1000 neonatal admissions (7/1000 live
births and 61/1000 admissions including CoNS) and the most common organisms were 
CoNS (54%), Enterobacteriaceae (21%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18%, 11% of which
were methicillin resistant S aureus). Fungi accounted for 9% of LOS (72% Candida 
albicans). The majority of pathogens causing EOS (95%) and LOS (84%) were
susceptible to commonly used empiric first line antibiotic combinations of
penicillin/gentamicin and flucloxacillin/gentamicin, respectively (excluding
CoNS).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors have established NeonIN in England and defined the
current epidemiology of neonatal infections. These data can be used for
benchmarking among units, international comparisons and as a platform for
interventional studies.
