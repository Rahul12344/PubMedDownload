In bacterial 16S rRNAs, methylated nucleosides are clustered within the decoding 
center, and these nucleoside modifications are thought to modulate translational 
fidelity. The N(4), 2'-O-dimethylcytidine (m(4)Cm) at position 1402 of the
Escherichia coli 16S rRNA directly interacts with the P-site codon of the mRNA.
The biogenesis and function of this modification remain unclear. We have
identified two previously uncharacterized genes in E. coli that are required for 
m(4)Cm formation. mraW (renamed rsmH) and yraL (renamed rsmI) encode
methyltransferases responsible for the N(4) and 2'-O-methylations of C1402,
respectively. Recombinant RsmH and RsmI proteins employed the 30S subunit (not
the 16S rRNA) as a substrate to reconstitute m(4)Cm1402 in the presence of
S-adenosylmethionine (Ado-Met) as the methyl donor, suggesting that m(4)Cm1402 is
formed at a late step during 30S assembly in the cell. A luciferase reporter
assay indicated that the lack of N(4) methylation of C1402 increased the
efficiency of non-AUG initiation and decreased the rate of UGA read-through.
These results suggest that m(4)Cm1402 plays a role in fine-tuning the shape and
function of the P-site, thus increasing decoding fidelity.
