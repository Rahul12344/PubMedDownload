OBJECTIVES: Shiga-toxin producing O157:H7 Entero Haemorrhagic E. coli [STEC/EHEC]
are the most common cause of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome [HUS] related to
infectious haemorrhagic colitis. Nearly all recommendations on long term
treatment of EHEC infections refer to this strain. The 2011 outbreak in Northern 
Europe was the first of this dimension to be caused by the serotype O104:H4. We
report on the 3.5 year follow up of 61 patients diagnosed with symptomatic EHEC
O104:H4 infection in spring 2011.
METHODS: Patients with EHEC O104 infection were followed in a monocentric,
prospective observational study at four time points: 4, 12, 24 and 36 months.
These data include the patients' histories, clinical findings, and complications.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients suffering from EHEC O104:H4 associated enterocolitis 
participated in the study at the time of hospital discharge. The mean age of
patients was 43 ± 2 years, 37 females and 24 males. 48 patients participated in
follow up 1 [FU 1], 34 patients in follow up 2 [FU 2], 23 patients in follow up 3
[FU 3] and 18 patients in follow up 4 [FU 4]. Out of 61 patients discharged from 
the hospital and included in the study, 54 [84%] were examined at least at one
additional follow up. Serum creatinine decreased significantly between discharge 
and FU 1 from 1.3 ± 0.1 mg/dl to 0.7 ± 0.1 mg/dl [p = 0.0045]. From FU 1 until FU
4, no further change in creatinine levels could be observed. The patients need of
antihypertensive medications decreased significantly [p = 0.0005] between
discharge and FU 1 after four months. From FU 1 until FU 3, 24 months later, no
further significant change in antihypertensive treatment was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients free of pathological findings at 
time of discharge do not need a specific follow up. Patients with persistent
health problems at hospital discharge should be clinically monitored over four
months to evaluate chronic organ damage. Progressive or new emerging renal damage
could not be observed over time in any patient.
