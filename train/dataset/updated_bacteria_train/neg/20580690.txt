Helicobacter pylori is a potent carcinogen associated with gastric cancer
malignancy. Recently, H. pylori Heat shock protein 60 (HpHSP60) has been reported
to promote cancer development by inducing chronic inflammation and promoting
tumor cell migration. This study demonstrates a role for HpHSP60 in angiogenesis,
a necessary precursor to tumor growth. We showed that HpHSP60 enhanced cell
migration and tube formation, but not cell proliferation, in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). HpHSP60 also indirectly promoted HUVEC proliferation 
when HUVECs were co-cultured with supernatants collected from HpHSP60-treated AGS
or THP-1 cells. The angiogenic array showed that HpHSP60 dramatically induced
THP-1 cells and HUVECs to produce the chemotactic factors IL-8 and GRO.
Inhibition of CXCR2, the receptor for IL-8 and GRO, or downstream
PLCbeta2/Ca2+-mediated signaling, significantly abolished HpHSP60-induced tube
formation. In contrast, suppression of MAP K or PI3 K signaling did not affect
HpHSP60-mediated tubulogenesis. These data suggest that HpHSP60 enhances
angiogenesis via CXCR2/PLCbeta2/Ca2+ signal transduction in endothelial cells.
