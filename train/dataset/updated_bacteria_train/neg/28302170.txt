BACKGROUND: Aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO) is a key enzyme involved in
the biosynthetic pathway of fatty alk(a/e)nes in cyanobacteria. However, cADO
(cyanobacterial ADO) showed extreme low activity with the k cat value below
1 min-1, which would limit its application in biofuel production. To identify the
activity related key residues of cADO is urgently required.
RESULTS: The amino acid residues which might affect cADO activity were identified
based on the crystal structures and sequence alignment of cADOs, including the
residues close to the di-iron center (Tyr39, Arg62, Gln110, Tyr122, Asp143 of
cADO-1593), the protein surface (Trp 178 of cADO-1593), and those involved in two
important hydrogen bonds (Gln49, Asn123 of cADO-1593, and Asp49, Asn123 of
cADO-sll0208) and in the oligopeptide whose conformation changed in the absence
of the di-iron center (Leu146, Asn149, Phe150 of cADO-1593, and Thr146, Leu148,
Tyr150 of cADO-sll0208). The variants of cADO-1593 from Synechococcus elongatus
PCC7942 and cADO-sll0208 from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were constructed,
overexpressed, purified and kinetically characterized. The k cat values of L146T,
Q49H/N123H/F150Y and W178R of cADO-1593 and L148R of cADO-sll0208 were increased 
by more than two-fold, whereas that of R62A dropped by 91.1%. N123H, Y39F and
D143A of cADO-1593, and Y150F of cADO-sll0208 reduced activities by ≤ 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: Some important amino acids, which exerted some effects on cADO
activity, were identified. Several enzyme variants exhibited greatly reduced
activity, while the k cat values of several mutants are more than two-fold higher
than the wild type. This study presents the report on the relationship between
amino acid residues and enzyme activity of cADOs, and the information will
provide a guide for enhancement of cADO activity through protein engineering.
