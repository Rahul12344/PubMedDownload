The alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase, FucT-VII, is crucial for the formation of
ligands for all three selectins, and its expression regulates the synthesis of
these ligands. Short-term polarized T helper (Th)1, but not Th2 or naive CD4(+) T
cells, can home to sites of inflammation, but the molecular basis for this
difference has remained unclear. Here we show that naive CD4(+) T cells do not
express FucT-VII and fail to bind vascular selectins. We also show that when
CD4(+) T cells are activated in the presence of the Th1 polarizing cytokine
interleukin (IL)-12, levels of FucT-VII mRNA and binding to E- and P-selectin are
significantly augmented. In contrast, activation of CD4(+) T cells in the
presence of IL-4, a Th2 polarizing cytokine, inhibited FucT-VII expression and
binding to vascular selectins. T cell activation upregulated expression of the
Core2 transferase, C2GnT, equivalently regardless of the presence or absence of
polarizing cytokines. These data indicate that the selective ability of Th1
cells, as opposed to Th2 cells or naive CD4(+) T cells, to recognize vascular
selectins and home to sites of inflammation is controlled principally by the
expression of a single gene, FucT-VII.
