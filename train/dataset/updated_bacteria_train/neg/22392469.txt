BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, some authors have reported outbreaks of
foodborne tonsillopharyngitis. On May 11, 2010 a series of cases of
tonsillopharyngitis among those attending a fellowship meeting on 8 March was
notified to the Epidemiological Surveillance Network in Andalusia (SVEA). The aim
of this study is to epidemiologically characterise the outbreak.
METHODS: Descriptive analysis of reported cases and case - control exposure to
the implicated food. The variables taken into account were age, sex, symptoms and
start date. Sources of information used were the records of the SVEA and
individual digital report (DIRAYA). Frequencies and attack rates were calculated,
and a Bayesian analysis for the comparison of difference in proportions of
disease was carried out for a 95% probability or credibility range (IP).
RESULTS: Among the 130 attendees at a communion 41 cases of tonsillopharyngitis
(attack rate 31.5%) were detected, and in smears Group A Beta-Hemolytic
Streptococcus was isolated. The most affected age group was the 25-44 year-olds, 
16 (39,0%); 68.6% (24) female. The egg salad showed a probability greater than
80% P(Δ>0.10 and Δ>0.15) for a 95% IP of risk of disease after intake and a
probability of having a lower risk of no disease.
CONCLUSIONS: It was a Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal outbreak, the
epidemiological evidence indicates exposure to common single source, hence the
hypothesis of dietary origin, the implicated food was egg salad. Contributing
factors could be cross-contamination after preparation favoured by the bad
practice and the conditions of the place.
