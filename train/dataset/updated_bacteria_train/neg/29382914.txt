Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the
atmosphere´s primary oxidant. An unknown strong daytime source of HONO is
required to explain measurements in ambient air. Emissions from soils are one of 
the potential sources. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) have been identified as
possible producers of these HONO soil emissions. However, the mechanisms for
production and release of HONO in soils are not fully understood. In this study, 
we used a dynamic soil-chamber system to provide direct evidence that gaseous
emissions from nitrifying pure cultures contain hydroxylamine (NH2OH), which is
subsequently converted to HONO in a heterogeneous reaction with water vapor on
glass bead surfaces. In addition to different AOB species, we found release of
HONO also in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), suggesting that these globally
abundant microbes may also contribute to the formation of atmospheric HONO and
consequently OH. Since biogenic NH2OH is formed by diverse organisms, such as
AOB, AOA, methane-oxidizing bacteria, heterotrophic nitrifiers, and fungi, we
argue that HONO emission from soil is not restricted to the nitrifying bacteria, 
but is also promoted by nitrifying members of the domains Archaea and Eukarya.
