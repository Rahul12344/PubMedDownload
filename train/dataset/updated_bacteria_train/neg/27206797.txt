We investigated the effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa mannose-sensitive
hemagglutinin (PA-MSHA) on the proliferation and invasion of human cervical
cancer cell lines, as well as the molecular pathways underlying these effects.
MTT cell proliferation assays revealed a time- and concentration-dependent
cytotoxic effect of PA-MSHA on HeLa cells but not H8 cells. Flow cytometry with
propidium iodide and annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling (FITC)
indicated that various concentrations of PA-MSHA could induce apoptosis and G2-M 
cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells. PA-MSHA also impaired the migration and invasion
abilities of HeLa cells in Wound healing and Transwell invasion assays. Western
blot results demonstrated that PA-MSHA reduced the expression of p-AKT, p-GSK3β, 
BCL-2, Vimentin and β-catenin, but increased the levels of PTEN, BAD, BAX and
E-cadherin in HeLa cells. Importantly, PTEN siRNA induced the activity of p-AKT, 
while PA-MSHA partly inhibited this induction, indicating that PA-MSHA may reduce
the cell proliferation and invasion potential by activating PTEN and thus
inhibiting the AKT pathway in vitro. These data suggest the potential application
of PA-MSHA to the treatment of human cervical cancer.
