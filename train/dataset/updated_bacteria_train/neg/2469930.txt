The gene clusters encoding various P-fimbriae (F7(1), F7(2), F9 and F11) were
compared. Deletion plasmids that lack the gene encoding the fimbrillin were
derived from these gene clusters. Introduction of these deletion plasmids into an
E. coli K12 strain resulted in non-fimbriated cells that still showed
mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MRHA). However when introduced into wild type
E. coli strains no MRHA was observed. Derivatives of the wild type E. coli
strains with reduced amounts of O-antigen on the other hand showed MRHA when
harbouring these plasmids. These results indicate that adhesion and presence of
fimbriae are not necessarily linked. P-fimbriae could function as a carrier for
the adhesin and thus endow adhesive capacity to cells with a complete O-antigen.
