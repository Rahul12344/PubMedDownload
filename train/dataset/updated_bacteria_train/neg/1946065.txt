[Fluoride prophylaxis a distant reality again?].

[Article in Italian]

Rini MS, D'Urso G.

The fluorine-prophylaxis is the caries only real therapeutic protection. The
fluorine modifies calcificated tissues composition and property
(hydroxyapatite----fluorapatite) and it acts on the plaque bacteria metabolism.
The fluorine intoxication is very rare. But interviewed parents are
disinterested, fear full and bad-informed. Unfortunately the fluorine-prophylaxis
and the periodic controls are a distant reality for Italy.
