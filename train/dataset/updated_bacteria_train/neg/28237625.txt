OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus produces up to five bi-component leukocidins - 
LukSF-PV, gamma-hemolysins AB and CB, LukGH (LukAB) and LukED - to evade innate
immunity by lysing phagocytic cells. Species specificity of these leukocidins
limits the relevance of animal models, therefore we assessed their individual
contribution using human neutrophils.
METHODS: Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were activated with stimuli
relevant during bacterial infections and sensitivity to recombinant leukocidins
was measured in cell-viability assays. Leukocidin receptor expression was
quantified by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We observed greatly variable sensitivities of different PMN preparations
towards LukGH. Activation of PMNs by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or S. aureus
culture supernatant (CS) lacking all leukocidins resulted in higher surface
expression of CD11b, the LukGH receptor, and greatly enhanced the sensitivity
towards LukGH, eliminating the variability observed with unstimulated cells. In
contrast, CS induced a decrease in sensitivity of PMNs to the other four
leukocidins and reduced surface staining for their cognate receptors (CXCR1,
CXCR2, C5aR, C5L2). Delta-toxin and peptidoglycan mimicked the effect of CS.
Moreover, IL-8, an important cytokine in neutrophil activation, also selectively 
increased LukGH sensitivity. Deletion of lukGH, but not other leukocidin genes,
prevented PMN killing upon infection with USA300 CA-MRSA.
CONCLUSION: Inflammatory signals enhance the susceptibility of human PMNs to
lysis by LukGH rendering this toxin dominant among the S. aureus leukocidins
in vitro.
