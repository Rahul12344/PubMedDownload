Staphylococcus aureus is the main pathogen associated with septic arthritis. Upon
infection, neutrophils are quickly recruited to the joint by different
chemoattractants, especially CXCR1/2 binding chemokines. Although their excessive
accumulation is associated with intense pain and permanent articular damage,
neutrophils have an important function in controlling bacterial burden. This work
aimed to study the role of CXCR2 in the control of infection, hypernociception
and tissue damage in S. aureus-induced septic arthritis in mice. The kinetics of 
neutrophil recruitment correlated with the bacterial load recovered from inflamed
joint after intra-articular injection of S. aureus. Treatment of mice from the
start of infection with the non-competitive antagonist of CXCR1/2, DF2156A,
reduced neutrophil accumulation, cytokine production in the tissue, joint
hypernociception and articular damage. However, early DF2156A treatment increased
the bacterial load locally. CXCR2 was important for neutrophil activation and
clearance of bacteria in vitro and in vivo. Start of treatment with DF2156A 3
days after infection prevented increase in bacterial load and reduced the
hypernociception in the following days, but did not improve tissue damage. In
conclusion, treatment with DF2156A seems be effective in controlling tissue
inflammation and dysfunction but its effects are highly dependent on the timing
of the treatment start.
