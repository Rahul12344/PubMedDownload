Sporulation during Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) contributes to
recurrent disease. Cell division and sporulation both require peptidoglycan
biosynthesis. We show C. difficile growth and sporulation is attenuated by
antisenses to murA and murC or the MurA inhibitor fosfomycin. Thus, targeting the
early steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis might reduce the onset of recurrent
CDI.
