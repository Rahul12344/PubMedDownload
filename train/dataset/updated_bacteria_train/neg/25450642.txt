Prokaryotic production systems have been widely used to manufacture recombinant
therapeutic proteins. Economically, the prokaryotic production – especially of
small therapeutic molecules – is advantageous compared to eukaryotic production
strategies. However, due to the potential endotoxin and host cell protein
contamination, the requirements for the purification process are
disproportionately higher and therefore more expensive and elaborate to
circumvent. For this reason, the goal of this work was to develop and establish a
rapid, simple, inexpensive and ‘up-scalable’ production and purification process,
using the therapeutic relevant protein anti-EGFR scFv hu225 as model molecule.
Configuring high cell density cultivation of Escherichia coli – using the rha-BAD
expression system as production platform – a specific product concentration up to
20 mgscFv/gCDW was obtained. By combining freeze-and-thaw, osmotic shock and pH
induced host cell protein precipitation, almost 70% of the product was extracted 
from the biomass. In a novel approach a mixed mode chromatography was implemented
as a capturing and desalting step, which allowed the direct application of
further ion exchange chromatography steps for purification up to pharmaceutical
grade. Thereby, 50% of the produced scFv could be purified within 10 h while
maintaining the biological activity.
