Rapid identification of residues that influence antibody expression and
thermostability is often needed to move promising therapeutics into the clinic.
To establish a method that can assess small expression differences, we developed 
a Bacterial Antibody Display (BAD) system that overcomes previous limitations,
enabling the use of full-length formats for antibody and antigen in a live cell
setting. We designed a unique library of individual framework variants using
natural diversity introduced by somatic hypermutation, and screened
half-antibodies for increased expression using BAD. We successfully identify
variants that dramatically improve expression yields and in vitro thermostability
of two therapeutically relevant antibodies in E. coli and mammalian cells. While 
we study antibody expression, bacterial display can now be expanded to examine
the processes of protein folding and translocation. Additionally, our natural
library design strategy could be applied during antibody humanization and library
design for in vitro display methods to maintain expression and formulation
stability.
