BACKGROUND: Tl-201 has potential in the preparation of radiolabelled compounds
similar to its homologues, like In-111 and radiogallium. In this paper, recently 
prepared [(201)Tl](III) vancomycin complex ([(201)Tl](III)VAN) has been evaluated
for its biological properties.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: [(201)Tl](III)VAN was prepared according to the optimized
conditions followed by biodistribution studies in normal rats for up to 52 h. The
Staphylococcus aurous specific binding was checked in vitro. The complex was
finally injected to normal rats. Tracer SPECT images were obtained in normal
animals and compared to those of (67)Ga-citrate.
RESULTS: Freshly-prepared [(201)Tl](III)VAN batches (radiochemical yield > 99%,
radiochemical purity > 98%, specific activity approximately 1.2 Ci/mmol) showed a
similar biodistribution to that of unlabeled vancomycin. The microorganism
binding ratios were 3 and 9 for tracer (201)Tl(3+) and tracer (201)Tl(III)DTPA,
respectively, suggesting the preservation of the tracer bioactivity. As a
nonspecific cell penetrating tracer, [(201)Tl](III)DTPA was used.
