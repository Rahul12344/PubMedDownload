MATERIAL AND METHODS: 100 consecutive cases after radical prostatectomy with a
bacterial count of 10(4) CFU/ml in midstream urine were followed during
urological inpatient rehabilitation without antibiotic treatment. Before
discharge, a follow-up examination with a urine dipstick and a second urine
culture were performed.
RESULTS: No symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI) occurred during the
average follow-up period of 15.2 days. Patients with unremarkable urine dipstick 
findings at follow-up (no leukocyturia and no haematuria and no nitrituria) had
no relevant bacteriuria (≥10(5) CFU/ml).54 of urine culture controls before
discharge were negative, 31 showed insignificant bacterial growth (≤10(4) CFU/ml)
and 15 had a bacterial count≥10(5) CFU/ml. 4 patients (27%) with > 10(5) CFU/ml
were successfully treated with antibiotics for clear signs of infection (fever,
chills, leukocytosis); the other 11 patients were just followed further.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though almost all patients after radical prostatectomy continue
to suffer from some discomfort that might be due to UTI, patients with
10(4) CFU/ml in midstream urine samples should not receive antibiotic treatment
unless they have clear systemic symptoms of an infection, e. g. fever, chills or 
leukocytosis. Unremarkable urine dipstick findings during the follow-up period
(no leukocyturia and no erythrocyturia and no nitrituria) rule out a relevant
bacteriuria (≥10(5) CFU/ml). Clear systemic signs of infection during follow-up
only occurred in 4 patients, who were successfully treated with test-adapted
antibiotics.
