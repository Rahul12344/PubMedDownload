BACKGROUND: In the UK, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common
bacterial infection presented by women in primary care. Recurrent urinary tract
infections (RUTIs) are defined as three episodes of UTI in the last 12 months, or
two episodes in the last 6 months. Between 20 and 30 % of women who have had one 
episode of UTI will have an RUTI, and approximately 25 % of these will develop
subsequent recurrent episodes. RUTIs can have a significant negative effect on
the quality of life, and have a high impact on health care costs as a result of
outpatient visits, diagnostic tests and prescriptions. Chinese herbal medicine
(CHM) has a recorded history of treatments for the symptoms of UTIs for more than
2000 years. More recent clinical research in China has provided some preliminary 
evidence that CHM can alleviate the symptoms of UTIs and reduce the rate of
recurrence, but more rigorous investigation is required.
METHODS/DESIGN: The RUTI trial is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled,
feasibility trial. A total of 80 women will be randomised to 'individualised'
herbs prescribed by a Chinese herbal practitioner or to 'standardised' herbs
provided by primary care clinicians. Both arms will have herbs for prevention of 
UTIs and treatment of acute episodes. Treatment duration is for 16 weeks. The
primary outcomes are the number of episodes of recurrent UTIs during the trial
period and in the 6 months of follow-up, and the number of days of symptoms rated
moderately bad or worse based on patient diaries. Secondary outcomes will assess 
participant expectations and beliefs, adherence to the treatment, adverse events 
and health economics and provide quantitative and qualitative assessments of the 
impact of recurrent infections on the lives of women.
DISCUSSION: The RUTI trial is the first instance of CHM delivered as a clinical
trial of an investigatory medicinal product in the UK. This study provides
important information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of researching 
and using CHM in Primary care. Once completed, it will provide provisional
estimates of the variance of change in continuous outcomes to inform a power
calculation for a larger, more definitive trial.
