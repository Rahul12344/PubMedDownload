In spite of their relatively limited antigen receptor repertoire, CD1d-restricted
NKT cells recognize a surprisingly diverse range of lipid and glycolipid
antigens. Recent studies of natural and synthetic CD1d-presented antigens provide
an increasingly detailed picture of how the specific structural features of these
lipids and glycolipids influence their ability to be presented to NKT cells and
stimulate their diverse immunologic functions. Particularly for synthetic
analogues of alpha-galactosylceramides which have been the focus of intense
recent investigation, it is becoming clear that the design of glycolipid antigens
with the ability to precisely control the specific immunologic activities of NKT 
cells is likely to be feasible. The emerging details of the mechanisms underlying
the structure-activity relationship of NKT cell antigens will assist greatly in
the design and production of immunomodulatory agents for the precise manipulation
of NKT cells and the many other components of the immune system that they
influence.
