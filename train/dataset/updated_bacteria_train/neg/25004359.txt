Algae frequently get a bad press. Pond slime is a problem in garden pools, algal 
blooms can produce toxins that incapacitate or kill animals and humans and even
the term seaweed is pejorative - a weed being a plant growing in what humans
consider to be the wrong place. Positive aspects of algae are generally less
newsworthy - they are the basis of marine food webs, supporting fisheries and
charismatic marine megafauna from albatrosses to whales, as well as consuming
carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Here we consider what algae are, their
diversity in terms of evolutionary origin, size, shape and life cycles, and their
role in the natural environment and in human affairs.
