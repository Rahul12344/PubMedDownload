Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with poor prognosis
and a high rate of recurrence despite early surgical removal. Hypoxic regions
within tumors represent sources of aggressiveness and resistance to therapy.
Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as major gene
expression regulators, their regulation and function following hypoxic stress are
still largely unexplored. Combining profiling studies on early-stage lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) biopsies and on A549 LUAD cell lines cultured in normoxic
or hypoxic conditions, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that are both correlated
with the hypoxic status of tumors and regulated by hypoxia in vitro. We focused
on a new transcript, NLUCAT1, which is strongly upregulated by hypoxia in vitro
and correlated with hypoxic markers and poor prognosis in LUADs. Full molecular
characterization showed that NLUCAT1 is a large nuclear transcript composed of
six exons and mainly regulated by NF-κB and NRF2 transcription factors.
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated invalidation of NLUCAT1 revealed a decrease in proliferative
and invasive properties, an increase in oxidative stress and a higher sensitivity
to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis of NLUCAT1-deficient cells
showed repressed genes within the antioxidant and/or cisplatin-response networks.
We demonstrated that the concomitant knockdown of four of these genes products,
GPX2, GLRX, ALDH3A1, and PDK4, significantly increased ROS-dependent caspase
activation, thus partially mimicking the consequences of NLUCAT1 inactivation in 
LUAD cells. Overall, we demonstrate that NLUCAT1 contributes to an aggressive
phenotype in early-stage hypoxic tumors, suggesting it may represent a new
potential therapeutic target in LUADs.
