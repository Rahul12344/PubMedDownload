Natural killer T (NKT) lymphocytes are αβ T cells activated by lipid-based
ligands presented on the non-polymorphic CD1d-molecule. Type I NKT cells that
carry an invariant Vα14 (in the mouse) or Vα24 (in humans) T cell receptor
α-chain rearrangement have received significant attention for their involvement
in a diversity of immune reactions. Their sister population, CD1d-restricted type
II NKT cells, has been more difficult to study because of the lack of molecular
markers that specify these cells. In the last few years, however, significant
progress has been made, demonstrating that type II NKT cells have unique
functions in immune responses to tumours and infections, in autoimmunity, obesity
and graft-versus-host disease. Type II NKT cells appear more frequent than type I
NKT cells in humans and accumulate in certain diseases such as ulcerative
colitis, hepatitis and multiple myeloma. Recently, novel type II NKT cell ligands
have been identified, and it is becoming clear that the type II NKT cell
population may be oligoclonal. Here, we review the recent progress in the study
of type II NKT cells, supporting the view that type II NKT cells may be
attractive targets for immunotherapy.
