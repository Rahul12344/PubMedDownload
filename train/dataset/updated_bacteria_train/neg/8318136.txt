Microaerophilic "campylobacter-like organisms" (CLO) were isolated from a
drinking water reservoir in Germany during a period of some months. The strains
were characterized by biotyping (API Campy), serotyping and
SDS-Disc-gelelectrophoresis as Arcobacter butzleri. Now this facultative
humanpathogen species was first described in Germany. With respect to the
drinking water treatment, the hygienic importance of the findings is given.
