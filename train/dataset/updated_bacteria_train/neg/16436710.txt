A series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of
UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB). Compounds 1 to 3, which are 
1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited
Escherichia coli MurB, Staphyloccocus aureus MurB, and E. coli MurA with 50%
inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microM, 4.3 to 10.3 
microM, and 6.8 to 29.4 microM, respectively. Compound 4, a C-4-unsubstituted
1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory
activity against E. coli MurB, S. aureus MurB, and E. coli MurC (IC50s, 24.5 to
35 microM). A fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3
with E. coli MurB, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nM. Structural
characterization of E. coli MurB was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a
complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure
indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of MurB and specific
interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide 
cofactor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of Staphylococcus
epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with
3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with IC50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microM. Antibacterial activity
was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (MICs, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (MICs, 4 to 
8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S.
aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae.
