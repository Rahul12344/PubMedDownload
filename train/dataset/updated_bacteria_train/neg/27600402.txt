OBJECTIVES: Based on the concept of immune dysregulation in immune
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and that Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an inflammatory
cytokine that plays an important role in autoimmune disease by inducing
interferon-γ secretion; this study aimed to assess a possible association between
the IL-18 promoter polymorphisms (-607 C/A site) and genetic susceptibility to
ITP and the impact of the immunoglobulins (Igs) concentrations level on disease
severity and response to therapy.
METHODS: A cross-section study was done on 105 patients' age range from 10 to 28 
years, with newly diagnosed ITP at the Oncology Center Mansoura University over
the past 2 years and 100 healthy subjects as a control group. For all patients
and controls, the IL-18 promoter polymorphism (-607 C/A site) as well as serum Ig
(IgG, IgM, IgA) concentration was determined.
RESULTS: The IL-18 promoter polymorphism (-607 C/A site) was not significantly
different between ITP patients and normal controls. The number of patients
respond to standard line of therapy was significantly higher in those with low
IgA levels as compared to those with high IgA levels (P = 0.02). On the other
hand, the number of patients respond to standard therapy was significantly higher
in those patients with high IgM levels as compared to those with low IgM levels
(54.7 vs. 36.5%) (P < 0.05). The number of patients with bleeding manifestation
was significantly higher among those with high IgA as compared to those with low 
IgA (43 of 79, 54.4%; vs. 36 of 79, 45.6%; P = 0.04). A change in IgG levels was 
not associated with response to treatment, bleeding tendency, or platelet counts.
CONCLUSION: There is no association between IL-18 promoter polymorphisms (-607
C/A site) and genetic susceptibility to ITP. High IgA and low IgM levels are a
bad index for treatment response to standard therapy.
