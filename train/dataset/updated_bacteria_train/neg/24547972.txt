Evaluation of the immune response in rainbow trout fry, Oncorhynchus mykiss
(Walbaum), after waterborne exposure to Flavobacterium psychrophilum and/or
hydrogen peroxide.

Henriksen MM, Kania PW, Buchmann K, Dalsgaard I.

The immune response in rainbow trout fry against Flavobacterium psychrophilum was
elucidated using an immersion-based challenge with or without prior exposure to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Samples were taken from the head kidney 4, 48, 125 and 
192 h after immersion, and the regulation of several genes was examined.
Bacterial load was assessed based on the presence of 16S rRNA and correlated with
gene expression, and the levels of specific antibodies in the blood were measured
50 days post-infection. Separately, both H2O2 and F. psychrophilum influenced
gene expression, and pre-treatment with H2O2 influenced the response to infection
with F. psychrophilum. Pre-treatment with H2O2 also affected correlation between 
gene regulation and pathogen load for several genes. A delay in antibody
production in H2O2-treated fish in the early phase of infection was indicated,
but H2O2 exposure did not affect antibody levels 50 days post-infection. An
increasing amount of F. psychrophilum 16S rRNA was found in the head kidneys of
infected fish pre-treated with H2O2 relative to the F. psychrophilum group. The
results show that a single pre-treatment with H2O2 impairs the response against
F. psychrophilum and may intensify infection.
