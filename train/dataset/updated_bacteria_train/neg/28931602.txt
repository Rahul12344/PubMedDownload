The role of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing
receptor NLRP10 in disease is incompletely understood. Using three mouse strains 
lacking the gene encoding NLRP10, only one of which had a coincidental mutation
in DOCK8, we documented a role for NLRP10 as a suppressor of the cutaneous
inflammatory response to Leishmania major infection. There was no evidence that
the enhanced local inflammation was due to enhanced inflammasome activity.
NLRP10/DOCK8-deficient mice harbored lower parasite burdens at the cutaneous site
of inoculation compared with wild-type controls, whereas NLRP10-deficient mice
and controls had similar parasite loads, suggesting that DOCK8 promotes local
growth of parasites in the skin, whereas NLRP10 does not. NLRP10-deficient mice
developed vigorous adaptive immune responses, indicating that there was not a
global defect in the development of Ag-specific cytokine production. Bone marrow 
chimeras showed that the anti-inflammatory role of NLRP10 was mediated by NLRP10 
expressed in resident cells in the skin rather than by bone marrow-derived cells.
These data suggest a novel role for NLRP10 in the resolution of local
inflammatory responses during L. major infection.
