PURPOSE: Bacterial pathogens are assumed to cause an illness course different
from that of nonbacterial causes of acute cough, but evidence is lacking. We
evaluated the disease course of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with a
bacterial cause in adults with acute cough.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter European trial in
which 2,061 adults with acute cough (28 days' duration or less) were recruited
from primary care and randomized to amoxicillin or placebo. For this analysis
only patients in the placebo group (n = 1,021) were included, reflecting the
natural course of disease. Standardized microbiological and serological analyses 
were performed at baseline to define a bacterial cause. All patients recorded
symptoms in a diary for 4 weeks. The disease course between those with and
without a bacterial cause was compared by symptom severity in days 2 to 4,
duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, and a return consultation.
RESULTS: Of 1,021 eligible patients, 187 were excluded for missing diary records,
leaving 834 patients, of whom 162 had bacterial LRTI. Patients with bacterial
LRTI had worse symptoms at day 2 to 4 after the first office visit (P = .014) and
returned more often for a second consultation, 27% vs 17%, than those without
bacterial LRTI (P = .004). Resolution of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse
did not differ (P = .375).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute bacterial LRTI have a slightly worse course of
disease when compared with those without an identified bacterial cause, but the
relevance of this difference is not meaningful.
