Cytomegalovirus colitis in immunocompetent patients has rarely been reported
without another severe illness. The prognosis is usually bad, leading to toxic
megacolon or death due to multi-organ system failure. We report a case of a
self-limited cytomegalovirus colitis in a young patient with no risk factor for
CMV infection or associated disease. This suggests that self-limiting CMV colitis
may be more frequent than is usually believed, and its prognosis may be better in
young patients with normal immune functions. Therefore it should be sought
systematically even in immunocompetent young patients.
