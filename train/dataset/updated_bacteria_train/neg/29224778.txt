Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potential curative therapy for
malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Improving the efficiency of stem cell
collection and the quality of the cells acquired can broaden the donor pool and
improve patient outcomes. We developed a rapid stem cell mobilization regimen
utilizing a unique CXCR2 agonist, GROβ, and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. A
single injection of both agents resulted in stem cell mobilization peaking within
15 min that was equivalent in magnitude to a standard multi-day regimen of
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Mechanistic studies determined
that rapid mobilization results from synergistic signaling on neutrophils,
resulting in enhanced MMP-9 release, and unexpectedly revealed genetic
polymorphisms in MMP-9 that alter activity. This mobilization regimen results in 
preferential trafficking of stem cells that demonstrate a higher engraftment
efficiency than those mobilized by G-CSF. Our studies suggest a potential new
strategy for the rapid collection of an improved hematopoietic graft.
