Dr. Sydney Finegold is one of the most heralded leaders in the discovery,
classification and scientific knowledge of anaerobic bacteria. On this occasion
of his 90th birthday, this paper celebrates his lifetime of accomplishments and
provides a perspective on the changes and growth in our understanding of one
anaerobic species, Bacteroides fragilis. Over the last nearly 40 years, clinical 
and research data have fostered our current view that B. fragilis are essential
symbiotes as well as, in some circumstances, pathogens with the capacity to
induce both acute systemic and abdominal illnesses and possibly chronic colonic
diseases.
