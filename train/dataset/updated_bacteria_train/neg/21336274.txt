Lymphoid cells that express the nuclear hormone receptor RORγt are involved in
containment of the large intestinal microbiota and defense against pathogens
through the production of interleukin 17 (IL-17) and IL-22. They include adaptive
IL-17-producing helper T cells (T(H)17 cells), as well as innate lymphoid cells
(ILCs) such as lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells and IL-22-producing NKp46+
cells. Here we show that in contrast to T(H)17 cells, both types of RORγt+ ILCs
constitutively produced most of the intestinal IL-22 and that the symbiotic
microbiota repressed this function through epithelial expression of IL-25. This
function was greater in the absence of adaptive immunity and was fully restored
and required after epithelial damage, which demonstrates a central role for
RORγt+ ILCs in intestinal homeostasis. Our data identify a finely tuned
equilibrium among intestinal symbionts, adaptive immunity and RORγt+ ILCs.
