BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this clinical cross-sectional study was to 
determine the level of active matrix metalloproteinase-8 (aMMP-8) and periodontal
pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) with varying periodontal conditions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 103 patients with RA and 104 healthy controls
(HC) were included. The assessment of periodontal status included periodontal
probing depth, bleeding on probing and clinical attachment loss. Periodontal
disease was classified as healthy/mild, moderate or severe. For the determination
of aMMP-8 levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and periodontal
pathogenic bacteria using polymerase chain reaction, samples of gingival
crevicular fluid were taken from the deepest gingival pockets. The statistical
analyses used included a Mann-Whitney U-test, a chi-squared test or a Fisher's
exact test, and the significance level was set at α = 5%.
RESULTS: We found that 65% of patients with RA and 79% of HC had moderate to
severe periodontal disease (p = 0.02). The prevalence of periodontal pathogens
was almost equal (p > 0.05). Furthermore, depending on periodontal disease
severity only minor differences in bacterial prevalence were detected. With
increasing severity of periodontal disease, higher aMMP-8 levels were observed.
Accordingly, a significant difference in patients with moderate periodontal
disease (RA: 15.3 ± 13.8; HC: 9.1 ± 9.1; p ≤ 0.01) and severe periodontal disease
(RA: 21.7 ± 13.3; HC: 13.1 ± 8.6; p = 0.07) was detected, with a greater tendency
in the latter group.
CONCLUSION: The increased aMMP-8 levels in the RA group indicate that the
presence of RA appears to have an influence on the host response at a comparable 
level of bacterial load and periodontal disease severity.
