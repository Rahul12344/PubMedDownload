Recombinant peptides related to Pej-SGP-I, one of several crustacean
hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs) existing in the kuruma prawn Penaeus japonicus,
were expressed in bacterial cells, and then purified after being allowed to
refold. Their circular dichroism spectra suggested that the recombinant Pej-SGP-I
having a free carboxyl-terminus (rPej-SGP-I-OH) differed slightly in secondary
structure from the recombinant Pej-SGP-I having an amidated C-terminus
(rPej-SGP-I-amide). The hyperglycemic activity of rPej-SGP-I-amide was comparable
to that of natural Pej-SGP-I, whereas rPej-SGP-I-OH showed weaker hyperglycemic
activity by approximately one order of magnitude. These results indicate that the
C-terminal amide of CHH affects secondary structure and is significant in
conferring hyperglycemic activity.
