We have previously established a two-plasmid system in Escherichia coli for
identification of promoters recognized by RNA polymerase containing a
heterologous sigma factor. Attempts to optimize this system for identification of
promoters recognized by RNA polymerase containing E. coli extracytoplasmic stress
response sigma(E) failed owing to high toxicity of the expressed rpoE. A new
system for identification of sigma(E)-cognate promoters was established, and
verified using the two known sigma(E)-dependent promoters, rpoEp2 and degPp.
Expression of the sigma(E)-encoding rpoE gene was under the control of the
AraC-dependent P(BAD) promoter. A low level of arabinose induced a non-toxic,
however, sufficient level of sigma(E) to interact with the core enzyme of RNA
polymerase. Such an RNA polymerase holoenzyme recognized both known
sigma(E)-dependent promoters, rpoEp2 and degPp, which were cloned in the
compatible promoter probe plasmid, upstream of a promoterless lacZ alpha reporter
gene. This new system has proved to be useful for identification of E. coli
sigma(E)-cognate promoters. Moreover, the system could be used for identification
of ECF sigma-cognate promoters from other bacteria.
