Five typing methods were evaluated, utilising 63 strains of fluorescent
pseudomonads, to assess their usefulness as tools to study the bacterial
diversity within this complex group. The methods used were Biolog metabolic
profiling, restriction fragment length polymorphism ribotyping, PCR ribotyping,
and repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) utilising BOX and
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) primers. Cluster analysis 
of the results clearly demonstrated the considerable homogeneity of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa isolates and, conversely, the heterogeneity within the other species, 
in particular P. putida and P. fluorescens, which need further taxonomic
investigation. Biolog metabolic profiling enabled the best differentiation among 
the species. Rep-PCR proved to be highly discriminatory, more so than the other
DNA fingerprinting techniques, demonstrating its suitability for the analysis of 
highly clonal isolates. RFLP ribotyping, PCR ribotyping, and rep-PCR produced
specific clusters of P. aeruginosa isolates, which corresponded to their origins 
of isolation, hence we recommend these methods for intraspecific typing of
bacteria.
