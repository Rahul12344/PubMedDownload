BACKGROUND: Vaccination is an attractive approach for the prevention of
Helicobacter pylori infection and disease. In a mouse model, infection induces an
accumulation of dendritic cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and B- and T cells to
the stomach mucosa, which is further heightened when the infection is preceded by
a mucosal immunization. We have studied the chemokines and chemokine receptors
guiding infection- and vaccination-induced immune cells to the stomach and their 
relation to protection against H. pylori infection in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were immunized sublingually with H. pylori
lysate antigens and cholera toxin adjuvant or left unimmunized, and then
challenged with live H. pylori bacteria. Stomach tissue was taken at 3, 7, 14 and
21 days after challenge and bacterial colonization, chemokine and chemokine
receptor gene expression, and influx of cells into the stomach mucosa were
evaluated.
RESULTS: RT-PCR array screening revealed differential expression of a broad range
of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes between immunized and unimmunized mice.
A significant upregulation of chemokines known to attract, among other cells,
eosinophils (CCL8), T cells (CXCL10, CXCL11) and neutrophils (CXCL2, CXCL5) and
of their cognate receptors CCR3, CXCR3 and CXCR2, preceded or coincided with
vaccine-induced protection, which was first evident 7 days after infection and
was then sustained at the later time-points. Consistent with the increase in
chemokines and chemokine receptors flow cytometric analysis indicated a
sequential accumulation of CD4(+) T cells, eosinophils, neutrophils and CD103(+) 
dendritic cells in the gastric lamina propria of immunized mice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into vaccination-induced chemokines
that guide the influx of protective immune cells into the stomach of H. pylori
infected mice.
