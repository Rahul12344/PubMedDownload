Induction of specific Escherichia coli genes by sublethal treatments with
alkylating agents.

Volkert MR, Nguyen DC.

Fusions of the lac operon to genes induced by treatment with sublethal levels of 
alkylating agents have been selected from random insertions of the Mu-dl(ApRlac) 
phage by screening for induction of beta-galactosidase activity in the presence
of methyl methanesulfonate. Genetic analysis reveals that these fusions resulted 
from insertion of Mu-dl(ApRlac) into two regions of the chromosome. One region
(aidA) is near his and, based on phenotypic effects, appears to represent
insertion into the alkA gene. The other region (aidB) is in the 92.3- to 98-min
region, which harbors no previously identified genes involved in repair of
alkylation damage. The aidB fusions caused increased resistance to alkylating
agents and caused little or no change in the biological effects of adaptation to 
alkylating agents. Unlike the aidA fusions, aidB fusions showed increased
beta-galactosidase activity in untreated cells in a growth phase-dependent
fashion. The ada-5 mutation, which blocks expression of the adaptive response,
decreased induction of beta-galactosidase activity in both aidA and aidB fusions 
after alkylation treatments. Thus, both aidA and aidB share with adaptive
response a common regulatory mechanism involving the ada gene. The growth
phase-dependent control of the aidB fusions, however, is unaffected by ada,
suggesting that a second regulatory mechanism exists that controls only aidB.
