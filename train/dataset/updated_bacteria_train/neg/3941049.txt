Discrimination between 34S and 32S during bacterial metabolism of inorganic
sulfur compounds.

Fry B, Cox J, Gest H, Hayes JM.

Sulfur isotope effects during the oxidation of thiosulfate by Thiobacillus
versutus were found to be negligible. This result is considered in relation to
other oxidative and reductive processes to assess which reactions are most likely
to control the isotopic compositions of sulfur compounds in microbial sulfureta.
