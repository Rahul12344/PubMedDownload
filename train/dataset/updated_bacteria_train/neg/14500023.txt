This study describes the application of filtration, infrared spectroscopy, and
multivariate analysis to the identification of 10 foodborne bacterial species.
The bacteria were applied by filtration to a disposable optical membrane that is 
transparent to infrared radiation. The filtration step was rapid (2 min).
Observed cellular infrared spectra were unique and were used to discriminate
among the different species. A dataset for the 10 bacterial species investigated 
was successfully used to correctly identify unknowns included in the dataset.
