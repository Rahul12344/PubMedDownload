The purple photosynthetic bacterium Chromatium vinosum, strain D, catalyzes
several oxidations of reduced sulfur compounds under anaerobic conditions in the 
light: e.g., sulfide --> sulfur --> sulfate, sulfite --> sulfate, and thiosulfate
--> sulfur + sulfate. Here it is shown that no sulfur isotope effect is
associated with the last of these processes; isotopic compositions of the sulfur 
and sulfate produced can differ, however, if the sulfane and sulfonate positions 
within the thiosulfate have different isotopic compositions. In the second
process, an observed change from an inverse to a normal isotope effect during
oxidation of sulfite may indicate the operation of 2 enzymatic pathways. In
contrast to heterotrophic anaerobic reduction of oxidized sulfur compounds,
anaerobic oxidations of inorganic sulfur compounds by photosynthetic bacteria are
characterized by relatively small isotope effects.
