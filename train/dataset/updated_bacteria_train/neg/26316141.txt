Much of the pronounced host inflammatory response that occurs in tuberculosis
(TB) is related to failed immunity against the invading pathogen. The G-protein
coupled receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 are implicated in important signal transduction
pathways in lung inflammatory responses. We investigated the expression and
function of these receptors in a simple whole blood model from 24 patients with
pulmonary TB and in subjects with latent TB infection (LTBI). Healthy controls
were recruited from close contacts to the pulmonary index patients. We found that
pulmonary TB patients had significantly increased CXCR1 expression on blood cells
compared to LTBI subjects and controls (p < 0.001). In contrast, LTBI subjects
had a significant increase in CXCR2 expression compared to pulmonary TB patients 
(p < 0.001) and controls (p < 0.01). Leukocyte function, measured as oxidative
capacity, was decreased in pulmonary TB patients compared to LTBI and controls
(p < 0.001) and correlated with the increased CXCR1 expression. Leukocyte
recruitment, measured as the expression of microRNA-223 was increased in
pulmonary TB patients compared to LTBI (p < 0.05). We found that variations in
receptor expression are linked to disease progression and affect the immune
response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).
