PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CXCR2 is key stimulant of immune cell migration and
recruitment, especially of neutrophils. Alleviating excessive neutrophil
accumulation and infiltration could prevent prolonged tissue damage in
inflammatory disorders. This review focuses on recent advances in our
understanding of the role of CXCR2 in regulating neutrophil migration and the use
of CXCR2 antagonists for therapeutic benefit in inflammatory disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have provided new insights into how CXCR2
signaling regulates hematopoietic cell mobilization and function in both health
and disease. We also summarize several CXCR2 regulatory mechanisms during
infection and inflammation such as via Wip1, T-bet, P-selectin glycoprotein
ligand-1, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, and microbiome. Moreover, we
provide an update of studies investigating CXCR2 blockade in the laboratory and
in clinical trials.
SUMMARY: Neutrophil homeostasis, migration, and recruitment must be precisely
regulated. The CXCR2 signaling pathway is a potential target for modifying
neutrophil dynamics in inflammatory disorders. We discuss the recent clinical use
of CXCR2 antagonists for controlling inflammation.
