When applying partial nitritation (PN) to anaerobically pre-treated sewage,
ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) will be
exposed to dissolved sulfide and methane. Both sulfide and methane may inhibit
nitrification. To gain knowledge necessary for sustaining PN under these
conditions, we exposed an AOB enrichment and a mixed nitrifying culture to
dissolved sulfide and methane. In the mixed nitrifying culture, sulfide
selectively inhibited NOB activity (KI,AOB1 = 150 mg-S L-1, KI,NOB = 10 mg-S L-1)
which shows that sulfide may help establish PN. The AOB enrichment showed similar
KI,AOB2 (130 mg-S L-1), but nitritation activity lagged longer than the time
necessary to remove sulfide from the liquid. This demonstrates that feeding of
sulfide into established PN should be avoided. Methane inhibition of AOB
enrichment was assessed in batch assays with 10 mg-CH4 L-1. As compared to
control without methane, AOB enrichment activity was identical. Up to 51% of
methane was converted to methanol, thus reducing the greenhouse gas emissions.
