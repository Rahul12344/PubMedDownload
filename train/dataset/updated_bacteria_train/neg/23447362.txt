The antibiotic feglymycin is a linear 13-mer peptide synthesized by the bacterium
Streptomyces sp. DSM 11171. It mainly consists of the nonproteinogenic amino
acids 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. An alanine scan of
feglymycin was performed by solution-phase peptide synthesis in order to assess
the significance of individual amino acid side chains for biological activity.
Hence, 13 peptides were synthesized from di- and tripeptide building blocks, and 
subsequently tested for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus
strains. Furthermore we tested the inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis
enzymes MurA and MurC, which are inhibited by feglymycin. Whereas the
antibacterial activity is significantly based on the three amino acids D-Hpg1,
L-Hpg5, and L-Phe12, the inhibitory activity against MurA and MurC depends mainly
on L-Asp13. The difference in the position dependence for antibacterial activity 
and enzyme inhibition suggests multiple molecular targets in the modes of action 
of feglymycin.
