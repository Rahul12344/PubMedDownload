BACKGROUND: To identify the risk factors for endogenous endophthalmitis secondary
to Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) liver abscess.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 200 patients with KP liver abscess from
1990 to 2000 was performed. Data variables included age, sex, past history,
systemic condition, initial and final visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy,
intraocular pressure, fundus, course and treatment.
RESULTS: Extrahepatic metastasis developed in 44 patients, including 18 cases (23
eyes) of endophthalmitis. Seventeen eyes had final vision less than counting
fingers. Diabetes had significant association with the development of
extrahepatic metastasis (p = 0.045) and the poor visual outcome of
endophthalmitis (p = 0.022), whereas, neither the initial vision nor vitrectomy
was significantly related to the outcome of endophthalmitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The visual prognosis of endogenous endophthalmitis secondary to KP
liver abscess is generally poor, and diabetes might be a significant risk factor 
for the poor visual outcome. Even when the initial vision is as bad as light
perception only, some eyes can be saved. Both internists and ophthalmologists
should be alert enough to detect and treat these patients early.
