PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of strategies
that should be employed in the prevention of infection at the surgical site in
patients undergoing colon surgery.
METHODS: The world's literature on the pathogenesis and prevention of infections 
at the surgical site in colon resection were reviewed to identify those methods
that are associated with improved rates of infection at the surgical site. The
pathogenesis, microbiology, diagnosis, and surveillance of surgical site
infection have been reviewed in the context of better understanding the accepted 
methods for prevention. Recommendations are provided based upon evidence-based
information when available.
RESULTS: Surgical site infection rates in colon surgery have been reduced
consistently over the last 60Â years of surgical practice. Preoperative and
intraoperative techniques are described which have been useful in this
improvement, while postoperative methods including the extension of postoperative
systemic antibiotics have not been of value.
CONCLUSIONS: Many methods have been demonstrated to improve surgical site
infection rates in colon surgery. However, consistent and standardized
applications of these principals in prevention currently do not exist.
Application of evidence-based practices can further reduce the morbidity and cost
of infection following colon surgery.
