The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of oral care using
simple tools and methods on the cleanliness of the oral cavity in the elderly.
Enrolled were 84 elderly subjects with a mean (+/-S.D) age of 85.1+/-7.0 years in
a nursing home. They were given tongue and oral mucosa cleaning (the oral care)
after lunch every day or every other day for two consecutive weeks by the
authors. The effect of the oral care was studied in terms of Candida scores in
tongue coating, concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) which are the
main causative substance of bad breath, and change in tongue coating scores. The 
above parameters were measured five times; just before the oral care program,
weekly during, and at the end of the oral care program. The groups of patients,
who were given the oral care, especially the group of patients cared with sponge 
brushes every day, showed a significant reduction in Candida scores but not in
VSC concentration and tongue coating scores. The present method of oral care
proved effective in cleaning the tongue and oral mucosa, and the Candida scores
appeared to be a reliable indicator for evaluation. It is suggested that this way
of oral care is simple, easy and useful not only for the elderly at a nursing
home but for the house-bound elder people who will rapidly increase in the near
future in Japan.
