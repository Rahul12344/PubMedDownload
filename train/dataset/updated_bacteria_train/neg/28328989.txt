Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen that causes nosocomial
infections generally associated with high mortality and morbidity in Intensive
Care Units (ICUs). Currently, little is known about the Quorum Sensing
(QS)/Quorum Quenching (QQ) systems of this pathogen. We analyzed these mechanisms
in seven clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Microarray analysis of one of these
clinical isolates, Ab1 (A. baumannii ST-2_clon_2010), previously cultured in the 
presence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL (a QS signalling molecule) revealed a putative QQ
enzyme (α/ß hydrolase gene, AidA). This QQ enzyme was present in all non-motile
clinical isolates (67% of which were isolated from the respiratory tract)
cultured in nutrient depleted LB medium. Interestingly, this gene was not located
in the genome of the only motile clinical strain growing in this medium (A.
baumannii strain Ab421_GEIH-2010 [Ab7], isolated from a blood sample). The AidA
protein expressed in E. coli showed QQ activity. Finally, we observed
downregulation of the AidA protein (QQ system attenuation) in the presence of
H2O2 (ROS stress). In conclusion, most of the A. baumannii clinical strains were 
not surface motile (84%) and were of respiratory origin (67%). Only the pilT gene
was involved in surface motility and related to the QS system. Finally, a new QQ 
enzyme (α/ß hydrolase gene, AidA protein) was detected in these strains.
