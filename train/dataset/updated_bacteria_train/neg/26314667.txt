Bismuth triple therapy was the first effective Helicobacter pylori eradication
therapy. The addition of a proton pump inhibitor helped overcome metronidazole
resistance. Its primary indication is penicillin allergy or when clarithromycin
and metronidazole resistance are both common. Resistance to the primary
first-line therapy have centered on complexity and difficulties with compliance. 
Understanding regional differences in effectiveness remains unexplained because
of the lack of studies including susceptibility testing and adherence data. We
discuss regimen variations including substitutions of doxycycline, amoxicillin,
and twice a day therapy and provide suggestions regarding what is needed to
rationally and effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy.
