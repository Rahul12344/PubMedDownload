Campylobacter species such as C. jejuni and C. coli are recognized as major
causes of acute gastroenteritis world-wide. Although C. jejuni and C. coli are
usually non-pathogenic in birds and animals, they cause enteric disease in humans
and the source of infection is often the consumption of contaminated foodstuffs. 
In this paper we report on the development and use of a multiplex PCR of C.
jejuni genomic DNA which yielded a PCR product with a unique polymorphic site
that can be used to quickly and accurately identify and group C. Jejuni isolates 
from any source including DNA, cell culture, skin washings and faecal samples.
The test is simple and sensitive and can detect purified DNA from a single
bacterium 10(2) cells from crude lysates, 10(3) cells in seeded faeces and 120
cells/ml of washing of 1 cm2 skin fragments of chicken skin.
