BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal
dystrophy (APECED), caused by autoimmune regulator (AIRE) mutations, manifests
with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and multisystem autoimmunity, most
often hypoparathyroidism (HP) and adrenal insufficiency (AI). European cohorts
previously reported a ~10% prevalence of APECED-associated hepatitis (APAH) with 
presentations ranging from asymptomatic laboratory derangements to fatal
fulminant hepatic failure. Herein, we characterized APAH in a large APECED cohort
from the Americas.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive patients with APECED were evaluated 
(2013-2015) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH; NCT01386437). Hepatology
consultation assessed hepatic and autoimmune biomarkers and liver ultrasound in
all patients. Liver biopsies evaluated autoimmune features and fibrosis. The 16S 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing was performed in 35 patients' stools (12 with and
23 without APAH). Among 43 evaluable patients, 18 (42%) had APAH; in 33.3% of
those with APAH, APAH occurred before developing classic APECED diagnostic
criteria. At APAH diagnosis, the median age was 7.8 years, and patients
manifested with aminotransferase elevation and/or hyperbilirubinemia. All
patients with APAH were in clinical remission during their NIH evaluation while
receiving immunomodulatory treatment. We found no difference in age, sex, or
prevalence of CMC, AI, or HP between patients with or without APAH. Autoantibody 
positivity against aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, cytochrome P450 family 1 
subfamily A member 2, histidine decarboxylase (HDC),
bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing B1, tryptophan hydroxlase,
and 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), and the homozygous c.967_979del13 AIRE mutation were 
associated with APAH development. Classical serological biomarkers of autoimmune 
hepatitis (AIH) were only sporadically positive. AIH-like lymphoplasmacytic
inflammation with mild fibrosis was the predominant histological feature. Stool
microbiome analysis found Slackia and Acidaminococcus in greater abundance in
patients with APAH.
CONCLUSIONS: APAH is more common than previously described, may present early
before classic APECED manifestations, and most often manifests with milder,
treatment-responsive disease. Several APECED-associated autoantibodies, but not
standard AIH-associated biomarkers, correlate with APAH.
