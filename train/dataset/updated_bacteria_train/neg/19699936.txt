A 64-year-old man was referred for aortic valve replacement due to severe
stenosis. He also suffered chronic sternal osteomyelitis with skin fistula
subsequent to radiation therapy. Both pathologies were approached simultaneously 
by sternal resection, omental plasty, and valve replacement, which led to
favorable primary and mid-term result.
