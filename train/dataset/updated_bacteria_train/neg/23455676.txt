NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) serve important roles in regulating the
intestinal microbiota and defense against pathogens. Whether NKp46+ ILCs arise
directly from lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells or represent a separate lineage
remains controversial. We report here that the transcription factor T-bet
(encoded by Tbx21) was essential for the development of NKp46+ ILCs but not of
LTi cells or nuocytes. Deficiency in interleukin 22 (IL-22)-producing NKp46+ ILCs
resulted in greater susceptibility of Tbx21-/- mice to intestinal infection.
Haploinsufficient T-bet expression resulted in lower expression of the signaling 
molecule Notch, and Notch signaling was necessary for the transition of LTi cells
into NKp46+ ILCs. Furthermore, NKp46+ ILCs differentiated solely from the CD4-
LTi population, not the CD4+ LTi population. Our results pinpoint the regulation 
of Notch signaling by T-bet as a distinct molecular pathway that guides the
development of NKp46+ ILCs.
