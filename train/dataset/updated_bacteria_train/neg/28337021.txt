The rapid evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance among bacterial
pathogens are outpacing the development of new antibiotics, but antivirulence
agents provide an alternative. These agents can circumvent antibiotic resistance 
by disarming pathogens of virulence factors that facilitate human disease while
leaving bacterial growth pathways - the target of traditional antibiotics -
intact. Either as stand-alone medications or together with antibiotics, these
drugs are intended to treat bacterial infections in a largely pathogen-specific
manner. Notably, development of antivirulence drugs requires an in-depth
understanding of the roles that diverse virulence factors have in disease
processes. In this Review, we outline the theory behind antivirulence strategies 
and provide examples of bacterial features that can be targeted by antivirulence 
approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the recent successes and failures of this
paradigm, and new developments that are in the pipeline.
