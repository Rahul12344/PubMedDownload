We have cloned the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell wall biosynthesis and cell
division gene cluster that corresponds to the mra operon in the 2-min region of
the Escherichia coli chromosome. The organization of the two chromosomal regions 
in P. aeruginosa and E. coli is remarkably similar with the following gene order:
pbp3/pbpB, murE, murF, mraY, murD, ftsW, murG, murC, ddlB, ftsQ, ftsA, ftsZ, and 
envA/LpxC. All of the above P. aeruginosa genes are transcribed from the same
strand of DNA with very small, if any, intragenic regions, indicating that these 
genes may constitute a single operon. All five amino acid ligases, MurC, MurD,
MurE, MurF, and DdlB, in addition to MurG and MraY were cloned in expression
vectors. The four recombinant P. aeruginosa Mur ligases, MurC, MurD, MurE, and
MurF were overproduced in E. coli and purified as active enzymes.
