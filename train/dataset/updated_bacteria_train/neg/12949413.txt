We describe a case of a dog with hepatosplenic lymphoma, a disease characterized 
by infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow with gammadelta T cells,
absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy, and an aggressive clinical course.
Physical examination findings, hematologic and biochemical abnormalities, and
clinical course of the disease in this patient were similar to those in humans.
Immunophenotyping of liver and spleen aspirates supported an antemortem diagnosis
of T-cell lymphoma consistent with hepatosplenic lymphoma. The diagnosis was
confirmed postmortem by a combination of routine histopathology, showing a
consistent pattern of organ involvement, and immunohistochemistry showing the
infiltrating neoplastic lymphocytes to be T cells expressing the gammadelta
T-cell receptor. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of
hepatosplenic lymphoma in a dog.
