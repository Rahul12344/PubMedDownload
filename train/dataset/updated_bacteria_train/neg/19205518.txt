penetrated organism, course of infections, in case of type of patogens, trim of
the patient and localization, can have without symptoms, sharp, chronic or
fulminant shape. The hardest course with the highest mortality occur in the cases
of mucormycosis and aspergillosis. Actually curiosity occur cases of fungal
infections, since this times consider to be unpathogenic for humans. For
treatment of sinus mycosis in majority chirurgical treatment is required. In
addition or the sake of morphological differentiation fungal, in their developing
cycle, treatment mycosis recommends serious difficulty, extra factor, which
impeds therapy, is a must of prolongely antifungal treatment and repeated (to
