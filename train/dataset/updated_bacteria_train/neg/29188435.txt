Antibody-drug conjugates are an emerging class of biopharmaceuticals changing the
landscape of targeted chemotherapy. These conjugates combine the target
specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the anti-cancer activity of
small-molecule therapeutics. Several antibody-drug conjugates have received
approval for the treatment of various types of cancer including gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (Mylotarg速), brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris速), trastuzumab emtansine
(Kadcyla速), and inotuzumab ozogamicin, which recently received approval
(Besponsa速). In addition to these approved therapies, there are many
antibody-drug conjugates in the drug development pipeline and in clinical trials,
although these fall outside the scope of this article. Understanding the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibody-drug conjugates and the
development of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models is indispensable, albeit
challenging as there are many parameters to incorporate including the disposition
of the intact antibody-drug conjugate complex, the antibody, and the drug agents 
following their dissociation in the body. In this review, we discuss how
antibody-drug conjugates progressed over time, the challenges in their
development, and how our understanding of their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
led to greater strides towards successful targeted therapy programs.
