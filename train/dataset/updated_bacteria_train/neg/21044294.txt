BACKGROUND: Following the publication of the Italian Guidelines for the control
and prevention of legionellosis an environmental and clinical surveillance has
been carried out in Southeastern Italy. The aim of the study is to identify the
risk factors for the disease, so allowing better programming of the necessary
prevention measures.
METHODS: During the period January 2000 - December 2009 the environmental
surveillance was carried out by water sampling of 129 health care facilities (73 
public and 56 private hospitals) and 533 buildings within the community (63
private apartments, 305 hotels, 19 offices, 4 churches, 116 gyms, 3 swimming
pools and 23 schools). Water sampling and microbiological analysis were carried
out following the Italian Guidelines. From January 2005, all facilities were
subject to risk analysis through the use of a standardized report; the results
were classified as good (G), medium (M) and bad (B). As well, all the clinical
surveillance forms for legionellosis, which must be compiled by physicians and
sent to the Regional Centre for Epidemiology (OER), were analyzed.
RESULTS: Legionella spp. was found in 102 (79.1%) health care facilities and in
238 (44.7%) community buildings. The percentages for the contamination levels <
1,000, 1,000-10,000, > 10,000 cfu/L were respectively 33.1%, 53.4% and 13.5% for 
samples from health care facilities and 33.5%, 43.3% and 23.2% for samples from
the community. Both in hospital and community environments, Legionella
pneumophila serogroup (L. pn sg) 2-14 was the most frequently isolate
(respectively 54.8% and 40.8% of positive samples), followed by L. pn sg 1
(respectively 31.3% and 33%). The study showed a significant association between 
M or B score at the risk analysis and Legionella spp. positive microbiological
test results (p < 0.001). From clinical surveillance, during the period January
2001 - August 2009, 97 cases of legionellosis were reported to the OER: 88 of
community origin and 9 nosocomial. The most frequent symptoms were: fever
(93.8%), cough (70.1%), dyspnea (58.8%), shivering (56.7%). Radiological evidence
of pneumonia was reported in 68%. The laboratory diagnostic methods used were:
urinary antigen (54.3%), single antibody titer (19.8%), only seroconversion
(11.1%), other diagnostic methods (14.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that risk analysis and environmental
microbiological surveillance should be carried out more frequently to control the
environmental spread of Legionella spp. Furthermore, the laboratory diagnosis of 
legionellosis cannot be excluded only on the basis of a single negative test:
some patients were positive to only one of the diagnostic tests.
