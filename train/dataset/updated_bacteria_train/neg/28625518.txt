Epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in gastrointestinal cancer (GIC)
development and progression, and most studies have been focused on aberrant DNA
methylation and histone modifying enzymes. However, the histone H3-H4 chaperone
ASF1A is an important factor regulating chromatin assembling and gene
transcription, while it is currently unclear whether ASF1A is involved in cancer 
pathogenesis. The present study is thus designed to address this issue. Here we
showed that ASF1A expression was widespread in GIC-derived cell lines and
up-regulated in primary GIC. Higher levels of ASF1A expression predicted
significantly shorter patient overall survival in colorectal cancer (P=0.0012).
The further analyses of the GEO dataset validate higher ASF1A expression as a
prognostic factor for CRC patients. Mechanistically, ASF1A interacted with
β-catenin and promoted the transcription of β-catenin target genes including
c-MYC, cyclin D1, ZEB1 and LGR5, thereby stimulating proliferation, stemness and 
migration/invasion of GIC cells. β-Catenin inhibition abolished these effects of 
ASF1A. Moreover, the ASF1A-β-catenin-ZEB1 axis down-regulated E-Cadherin
expression, thereby contributing to enhanced migration/invasion of GIC cells.
ASF1A over-expression and depletion facilitated and inhibited in vivo tumor
growth and/or metastasis in mouse xenograft models, respectively. Taken together,
ASF1A is aberrantly over-expressed in GIC tumors and plays key roles in GIC
development and progression by stimulating the transcription of β-catenin target 
genes. ASF1A may thus be a novel target for GIC therapy and a potential
prognostic marker.
