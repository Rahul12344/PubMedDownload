The purpose of this study was to investigate the geographical distribution of
bovine ehrlichiosis in the Cantons Zürich, Schaffhausen, Thurgau, St. Gallen and 
Obwalden. To this end, an indirect immunofluorescence assay was established. The 
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was estimated to be close to 100% based on
the results obtained with several reference sera from the US National Veterinary 
Services Laboratories and the seroconversion panels of 20 heifers and cows. Blood
samples from 2557 healthy cattle were tested for antibody response against
Ehrlichia phagocytophila. Ninety-three animals (3.6%) were seropositive with
titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:320. Most of the positive animals were found in the
area north of lake Zürich spanning to the german border, in the area between
Walensee and Bad Ragaz, the Rhine valley and Klein Melchtal. All seropositive
animals had grazed on pastures or alps with a favourable biotope for the tick
Ixodes ricinus.
