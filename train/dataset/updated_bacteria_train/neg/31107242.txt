The nuclear protein DEK is an endogenous DNA-binding chromatin factor regulating 
hematopoiesis. DEK is one of only 2 known secreted nuclear chromatin factors, but
whether and how extracellular DEK regulates hematopoiesis is not known. We
demonstrated that extracellular DEK greatly enhanced ex vivo expansion of
cytokine-stimulated human and mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and regulated
HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) numbers in vivo and in vitro as
determined both phenotypically (by flow cytometry) and functionally (through
transplantation and colony formation assays). Recombinant DEK increased long-term
HSC numbers and decreased HPC numbers through a mechanism mediated by the CXC
chemokine receptor CXCR2 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (as determined
utilizing Cxcr2-/- mice, blocking CXCR2 antibodies, and 3 different HSPG
inhibitors) that was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and
p38 MAPK. To determine whether extracellular DEK required nuclear function to
regulate hematopoiesis, we utilized 2 mutant forms of DEK: one that lacked its
nuclear translocation signal and one that lacked DNA-binding ability. Both
altered HSC and HPC numbers in vivo or in vitro, suggesting the nuclear function 
of DEK is not required. Thus, DEK acts as a hematopoietic cytokine, with the
potential for clinical applicability.
