Natural killer (NK) cells belong to the innate lymphoid cells. Their cytotoxic
activity is regulated by the delicate balance between activating and inhibitory
signals. NKp46 is a member of the primary activating receptors of NK cells. We
previously reported that the NKp46 receptor is involved in the development of
type 1 diabetes (T1D). Subsequently, we hypothesized that blocking this receptor 
could prevent or hinder disease development. To address this goal, we developed
monoclonal antibodies for murine NKp46. One mAb, named NCR1.15, recognizes the
mouse homologue protein of NKp46, named Ncr1, and was able to down-regulate the
surface expression of NKp46 on primary murine NK cells following antibody
injection in vivo. Additionally, NCR1.15 treatments were able to down-regulate
cytotoxic activity mediated by NKp46, but not by other NK receptors. To test our 
primary assumption, we examined T1D development in two models, non-obese diabetic
mice and low-dose streptozotocin. Our results show a significantly lower
incidence of diabetic mice in the NCR1.15-treated group compared to control
groups. This study directly demonstrates the involvement of NKp46 in T1D
development and suggests a novel treatment strategy for early insulitis.
