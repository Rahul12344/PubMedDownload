In two waste disposal sites in Cairo, drinking water samples from springs,
drinking vessels and kitchens were investigated. Total germ count lay seldom
below one thousand and ten million pro ml. Apart from various faecal germs,
Aeromonas hydrophila was also found. The high occurrence of diarrhoeal diseases
among the inhabitants of the waste disposal sites can be traced with certainty to
the extremely bad drinking water quality.
