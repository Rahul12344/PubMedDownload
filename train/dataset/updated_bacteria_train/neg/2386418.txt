In newly constructed houses and buildings in which self-leveling mortar
containing casein has been used, residents and office employees have noted a bad 
odor and have complained of headache, eye and throat irritation, and tiredness.
These problems were suspected to result from the degradation products emitted
from the mortar. Samples obtained from dry mortar powder and from mortar in
buildings where casein was used and from control buildings were found to contain 
microorganisms (mean of 10(2) culture forming units/g). Environmental species
were predominantly found, e.g., Bacillus, Clostridium, Micrococcus, and
Propionibacterium. Fungi were found occasionally; no evidence of bacterial
degradation was found. Headspace and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric
analysis of air from the newly constructed houses and from hydroxide-degraded
casein revealed the presence of amines in the 0.003-0.013 ppm range and the
presence of ammonia and sulfhydryl compounds, all of which in low concentrations 
can cause the symptoms observed. These substances, however, were not detected in 
control buildings.
