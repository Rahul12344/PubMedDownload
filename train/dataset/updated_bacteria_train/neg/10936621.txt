The neuroparalytic syndromes of tetanus and botulism are caused by neurotoxins
produced by bacteria of the genus Clostridium. They are 150 kDa proteins
consisting of three-domains, endowed with different functions: neurospecific
binding, membrane translocation and specific proteolysis of three key components 
of the neuroexocytosis apparatus. After binding to the presynaptic membrane of
motoneurons, tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) is internalized and transported
retroaxonally to the spinal cord, where it blocks neurotransmitter release from
spinal inhibitory interneurons. In contrast, the seven botulinum neurotoxins
(BoNT) act at the periphery and inhibit acetylcholine release from peripheral
cholinergic nerve terminals. TeNT and BoNT-B, -D, -F and -G cleave specifically
at single but different peptide bonds, VAMP/synaptobrevin, a membrane protein of 
small synaptic vesicles. BoNT types -A, -C and -E cleave SNAP-25 at different
sites within the COOH-terminus, whereas BoNT-C also cleaves syntaxin. BoNTs are
increasingly used in medicine for the treatment of human diseases characterized
by hyperfunction of cholinergic terminals.
