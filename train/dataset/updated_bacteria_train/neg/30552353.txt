To enhance bacterial resistance and osteogenesis of titanium (Ti) -based
implants, TiO2/calcium-phosphate coatings (TiCP) doped with various amounts of
fluorine (F) (designated as TiCP-F1, TiCP-F6, and TiCP-F9) were prepared on Ti by
micro-arc oxidation. The F doped TiCP coatings possess a microporous structure
(pore size of 3-4 μm in average diameter) which is evenly covered by nano-grains 
of 30-60 nm in size. Successful F incorporation into TiCP was determined by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and it shows weak influence on the microstructure,
phase compositions, surface roughness and wettability of TiCP. All the coatings
bonded firmly to the Ti substrates and showed enduring high adhesion strength in 
biological circumstances. The bacterial resistance and osteogenesis of the
coatings were evaluated by implanting testing materials in vitro and in an
infected rabbit model caused by bacteria. Both the in vitro and in vivo results
indicated that TiCP and TiCP-F1 were of much higher osteogenic activity compared 
with Ti but lacking of bacterial resistance, whereas TiCP with high F addition
(TiCP-F6 and TiCP-F9) exhibited both dramatically improved bacterial resistance
and osteogenesis. In summary, TiCP-F6 possessed the best antibacterial and
osteogenic activities, especially exhibited excellent osseointegration efficacy
in the infected rabbit model.
