Subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) reside in the mucosa and regulate immune 
responses to external pathogens. While ILCs can be phenotypically classified into
ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets, the transcriptional control of commitment to each
ILC lineage is incompletely understood. Here we report that the transcription
factor Runx3 was essential for the normal development of ILC1 and ILC3 cells but 
not of ILC2 cells. Runx3 controlled the survival of ILC1 cells but not of ILC3
cells. Runx3 was required for expression of the transcription factor RORÎ³t and
its downstream target, the transcription factor AHR, in ILC3 cells. The absence
of Runx3 in ILCs exacerbated infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Therefore, our
data establish Runx3 as a key transcription factor in the lineage-specific
differentiation of ILC1 and ILC3 cells.
