Biofilm is a complex structure of microbiome having different bacterial colonies 
or single type of cells in a group; adhere to the surface. These cells are
embedded in extracellular polymeric substances, a matrix which is generally
composed of eDNA, proteins and polysaccharides, showed high resistance to
antibiotics. It is one of the major causes of infection persistence especially in
nosocomial settings through indwelling devices. Quorum sensing plays an important
role in regulating the biofilm formation. There are many approaches being used to
control infections by suppressing its formation but CRISPR-CAS (gene editing
technique) and photo dynamic therapy (PDT) are proposed to be used as therapeutic
approaches to subside bacterial biofim infections, especially caused by deadly
drug resistant bad bugs.
