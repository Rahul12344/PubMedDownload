Bacterial inoculum and the activity of antimicrobial agents.

Fry DE, Garrison RN, Trachtenberg L, Polk HC Jr.

Experimental and clinical infections have concentrations of bacteria that are
greater than the concentrations used in the laboratory for the determination of
in vitro activity. When realistic concentrations are used, the antibiotic
activity is reduced. The optimum selection of antibiotics may require a
re-examination of the laboratory procedures for the determination of sensitivity 
data.
