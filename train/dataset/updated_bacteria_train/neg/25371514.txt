BACKGROUND: Minocycline is an "old-drug" with Food and Drug Administration
approval for the treatment of infection due to Acinetobacter species. The purpose
of this study is to describe an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program's evaluation of
minocycline for the treatment of patients with multidrug resistant A. baumannii
(MDR-AB) infections.
METHODS: This study evaluated hospitalized adult patients (September 2010 through
March 2013) who received minocycline intravenously (IV) for a MDR-AB infection.
Clinical and microbiological outcomes were analyzed. Secondary outcomes included 
infection-related mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), infection-related
LOS, intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, mechanical ventilation days, and 30-day
readmission.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients received minocycline. Median age was 56 (23-85)
years, 65% were male with an APACHE II score of 21 (4-41). Clinical success was
achieved in 40/55 (73%) patients treated with minocycline monotherapy (n = 3) or 
in combination with a second active agent (n = 52). Overall 43 (78%) patients
demonstrated documented or presumed microbiologic eradication. Infection-related 
mortality was 25%. Hospital LOS was 31 (5-132) and infection-related LOS was 16
(2-43) days. Forty-seven (85%) patients were admitted to the ICU for a LOS of 18 
(2-78) days. Thirty-nine (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation for 6
(2-29) days. One patient had a 30-day readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: The response rate to minocycline monotherapy or in combination for
the treatment of MDR-AB infections is encouraging as therapeutic options are
limited. Prospective studies in patients with MDR-AB infections will help
establish the role of minocycline alone or in combination with other
antimicrobials.
