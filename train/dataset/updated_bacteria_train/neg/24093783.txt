OBJECTIVE: To screen and isolate an eco-friendly, a thermophilic and potent
L-asparaginase producing bacterium, with novel immunological properties that may 
obviates hypersensitivity reactions.
METHODS: In the present study bacterial strain isolated for extracellular
L-asparaginase production from hotspring, identified by morphological,
biochemical and physiological tests followed by 16S rDNA technology and the
L-asparaginase production ability was tested by both semi quantitative and
quantitative enzymatic assay.
RESULTS: The bacterial strain was identified as Bacillus subtilis strain hswx88
(GenBank Accession Number: JQ237656.1). The extracellular enzyme yielding
capacity isolate Bacillus subtilis strain hswx88 (23.8 IU/mL) was found to be 1.7
and 14.5 times higher than the reference organism Pectobacterium carotovorum MTCC
1428 (14.2 IU/mL) and Bacillus sp. BCCS 034 (1.64 IU/mL).
CONCLUSION: The isolate is eco-friendly and useful to produce bulk quantity of
extracellular, thermophilic L-asparaginase for the treatment of various tumor
cases and for preparation of acrylamide free fry food preparation.
