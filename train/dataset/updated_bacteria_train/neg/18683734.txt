OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the significance of variables such as saliva mutans
streptococci, oral hygiene, dietary habits, oral hygiene habits and
socio-economic status in assessing the level of caries risk for preschool
children.
METHODS: The case-control study was used. Among 1018 children at the age of 4 and
5, 204 children with dmft > or = 6 were included in caries group and 237 children
in caries free group. Saliva mutans streptococci, saliva flow rate and buffer
capacity, and debris index were tested for all children. Their mothers finished
the standardized questionnaire for information about dietary and oral hygiene
habits of the children, breast and bottle feeding history and socio-economic
status.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that the saliva mutans streptococci 
(OR = 3.019), debris index (OR = 2.263), frequency of consumption of snacks and
sweets (OR = 1.729), frequency of intake of soft drinks (OR = 1.496) and use of
sweetened food in nursing bottle (OR = 2.255) were significant factors.
CONCLUSIONS: High level of saliva mutans streptococci, bad oral hygiene, frequent
intake of sweet food, and sugar contents in nursing bottle were the important
risk factors for dental caries on primary teeth.
