BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a serious complication
of Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA). The Th-17 immune response characterised by IL 
(interleukin)-17A, IL-17F, IL-23, chemotactic cytokines and their receptors,
plays a prominent role in the immune response to invading bacteria. In addition, 
high expression of IL-17A has been reported in PJI. The aim of this study was to 
investigate whether genetic variation in the key molecules of the Th-17 immune
response can affect the risk for PJI.
METHODS: Altogether ten Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL17A
(rs2275913), IL17F (rs763780), IL4 (rs2243250), IL12A (rs583911), IL12B
(rs3212227 and (rs17860508), IL23R (rs7517847), CXCL1 (rs4074), CXCL5 (rs425535) 
and CXCR2 (rs2230054) genes were genotyped by PCR with sequence specific primers 
(SSP) in 98 patients with PJI and two control groups 1) an aseptic TJA control
(253 patients with TJA that did not develop PJI at least 6 yrs. after the
surgery) and 2) a population control (185 healthy control subjects without TJA).
RESULTS: Allele, genotype and phenotype frequencies of investigated SNPs did not 
differ between the patients with PJI and control patients with aseptic TJA
(p>0.05). There was no difference in the distribution of tested SNPs between
patients with PJI and population controls without TJA (p>0.05) or between the two
controls groups (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We cannot nominate any of studied polymorphisms in IL17A, IL17F,
IL4, IL12A, IL12B, IL23R, CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCR2 genes as risk factors for PJI in
the Czech TJA patients examined.
