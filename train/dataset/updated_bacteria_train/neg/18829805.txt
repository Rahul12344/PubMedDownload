OBJECTIVE: Pediatric influenza-associated death became a nationally notifiable
condition in the United States during 2004. We describe influenza-associated
pediatric mortality from 2004 to 2007, including an increase of Staphylococcus
aureus coinfections.
METHODS: Influenza-associated pediatric death is defined as a death of a child
who is younger than 18 years and has laboratory-confirmed influenza. State and
local health departments report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on influenza-associated pediatric
deaths.
RESULTS: During the 2004-2007 influenza seasons, 166 influenza-associated
pediatric deaths were reported (n = 47, 46, and 73, respectively). Median age of 
the children was 5 years. Children often progressed rapidly to death; 45% died
within 72 hours of onset, including 43% who died at home or in an emergency
department. Of 90 children who were recommended for influenza vaccination, only 5
(6%) were fully vaccinated. Reports of bacterial coinfection increased
substantially from 2004-2005 to 2006-2007 (6%, 15%, and 34%, respectively). S
aureus was isolated from a sterile site or endotracheal tube culture in 1 case in
2004-2005, 3 cases in 2005-2006, and 22 cases in 2006-2007; 64% were
methicillin-resistant S aureus. Children with S aureus coinfection were
significantly older and more likely to have pneumonia and acute respiratory
distress syndrome than those who were not coinfected.
CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-associated pediatric mortality is rare, but the proportion
of S aureus coinfection identified increased fivefold over the past 3 seasons.
Research is needed to identify risk factors for influenza coinfection with
invasive bacteria and to determine the impact of influenza vaccination and
antiviral agents in preventing pediatric mortality.
