In October 2001, four cases of inhalational anthrax occurred in workers in a
Washington, D.C., mail facility that processed envelopes containing Bacillus
anthracis spores. We reviewed the envelopes' paths and obtained exposure
histories and nasal swab cultures from postal workers. Environmental sampling was
performed. A sample of employees was assessed for antibody concentrations to B.
anthracis protective antigen. Case-patients worked on nonoverlapping shifts
throughout the facility, suggesting multiple aerosolization events. Environmental
sampling showed diffuse contamination of the facility. Potential workplace
exposures were similar for the case-patients and the sample of workers. All nasal
swab cultures and serum antibody tests were negative. Available tools could not
identify subgroups of employees at higher risk for exposure or disease.
Prophylaxis was necessary for all employees. To protect postal workers against
bioterrorism, measures to reduce the risk of occupational exposure are necessary.
