Serratial bacteremia in the surgical patient.

Fry DE, Fry RV, Shlaes DM.

A 42-month review has identified 32 surgical patients that had 45 episodes of
Serratia marcescens bacteremia. Patients were identified in many surgical
specialties. The primary focuses of infection were the urinary tract,
intravascular devices, sputum, and soft tissue. In five patients, no focus was
identifiable. Nine patients had polymicrobial sepsis with other bacteria or
Candida. Of 41 isolates studied, five were resistant to all antibiotics that were
commercially available. Only 76 per cent were sensitive to amikacin, 63 per cent 
to gentamicin, and 46 per cent to tobramycin. Statistically fewer patients died
when an aminoglycoside and an expanded-spectrum penicillin were used in
combination. The 44 per cent mortality rate of this group of patients indicates
that environmental control, behavioral modification of health care professionals,
and a more rationale use of broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary to prevent
this morbid complication.
