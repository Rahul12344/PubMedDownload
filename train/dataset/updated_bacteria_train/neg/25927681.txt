Streptococcus pneumoniae is a rarely cause of neonatal sepsis. Its prevalence is 
low but with a mortality of 50%. Measures to prevent Streptococcus agalactiae
transmission could help to increase Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) in
newborns. Transmission could be from mother intrapartum; or in those cases of
late onset sepsis, the community carriers. Systematic vaccination with PCV-7 and 
PCV-13 has reduced IPD rates. We present a case of a newborn with no perinatal
risk factors for infection. In the first 24 hours after surgery of an ovarian
cyst, the patient started with bad general condition with fever and regular
perfusion. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started. Streptococcus pneumoniae was
isolated in blood culture.CONCLUSION: In neonatal sepsis, we always think in
Streptococcus agalactiae. Streptococcus pneumoniae is rare but with a high
morbidity and mortality. Systematic vaccination is a measure that has
demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of Invasive pneumococcal disease.
