Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of T lymphocytes that
recognize glycolipid antigens in the context of the antigen-presenting molecule
CD1d. Upon glycolipid antigen stimulation, iNKT cells rapidly produce copious
amounts of immunomodulatory cytokines, leading to potent activation of a variety 
of innate and adaptive immune cells. These immune-potentiating properties of iNKT
cells hold great promise for the development of vaccine adjuvants. This review
aims to summarize the immunomodulatory activities of iNKT cell ligands and to
discuss prospects for developing iNKT cell-based vaccine adjuvants.
