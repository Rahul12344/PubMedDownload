BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that oral organisms in children are mainly
those transmitted from their mothers. That may account for the relationship
between caries levels in children and their parents. However, few studies have
investigated the effect of trying to prevent vertical transmission of oral
organisms on dental caries levels in children, and the findings in the studies
are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the association
between measures to prevent vertical transmission of oral organisms and the
caries experience in 3-year-old children.
METHODS: Data were collected from dental examinations for 3-year-old children and
a self-administered questionnaire for their caregivers. Absence of maternal
sharing of utensils and mouth-to-mouth feeding between caregivers and children
was used as the variable about behaviour to prevent vertical transmission of oral
organisms. Sex, age in months, dietary behaviour, oral health behaviour and
sociodemographic factors were used as covariates.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Data for 3,035 children (73.5% of the subjects) were
analysed. Caregivers who practised vertical transmission prevention tended to
have better oral health behaviours. Multivariate logistic regression analysis did
not show any significant association between behaviour to prevent vertical
transmission and caries experience (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.86-1.41). This study
suggests that caregiver behaviour to prevent vertical transmission was not
effective in reducing levels of childhood caries.
