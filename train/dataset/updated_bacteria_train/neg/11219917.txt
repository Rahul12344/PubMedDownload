We report a case of fourteen years old boy with cat scratch disease. He was
treated at Pediatric Clinic in January and February 2000. Cat scratch disease is 
benign infectious chronic disease which appears in all ages. It begins after
contact with cat and its scratch. Yearly incidence of this disease for whole
population is 0.77-0.86/100.000. The cause is bacillus Bartonella which is also
called genus Rochalimaea. It is Gram negative, mobile, aerobe bacillus with ten
flagellas on one pole. Our patient was admitted at hospital because of high
temperature, paleness, fatigue, bad appetite and pains in his joint. Ultrasound
and magnet resonance scans of liver and spleen showed enlarged but regulary
contured liver and two focal changes with diameter 16 mm, 12 mm and 7 mm in
spleen. All those focal changes were described as abscesses. Diagnose was set up 
according increasing titre of IF-Bartonella hensalae IgG 1:256 (positive). This
diagnostic test was performed at Institute for microbiology and Immunology at
Medical Faculty in Ljubljana. Disease had long lasting course, and was cured by
antibiotics without surgical intervention.
