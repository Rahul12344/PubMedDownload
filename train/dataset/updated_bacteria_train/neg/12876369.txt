UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl:L-alanine ligase (MurC) is involved in the pathway leading
from UDP-N-glucosamine to the UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl:pentapeptide unit, which is
the building block for the peptidoglycan layer found in all bacterial cell walls.
The pathways leading to the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer are important
targets for the development of novel antibiotics, since animal cells do not
contain these pathways. MurC is the first of four similar ATP-dependent
amide-bond ligases which share primary and tertiary structural similarities. The 
crystal structures of three of these have been determined by X-ray
crystallography, giving insights into the binding of the carbohydrate substrate
and the ATP. Diffraction-quality crystals of the enzyme MurC have been obtained
in both native and selenomethionine forms and X-ray diffraction data have been
collected at the Se edge at a synchrotron source. The crystals are orthorhombic, 
with unit-cell parameters a = 73.9, b = 93.6, c = 176.8 A, and diffraction has
been observed to 2.6 A resolution.
