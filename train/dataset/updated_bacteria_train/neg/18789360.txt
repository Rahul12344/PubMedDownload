Modified linker-PCR primers were developed to enable complete sequencing of a
DGGE band in one reaction. Commonly used bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene
PCR-DGGE primers were modified to contain linkers and sequencing primers. This
protocol does not involve additional stages, and improves retrieval of sequence
from DGGE bands by approximately 23%.
