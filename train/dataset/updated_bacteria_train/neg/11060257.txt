Infectious endocarditis is a disease which mainly involves the cardiac valves. It
has a bad prognosis and is caused by a great variety of microorganisms.
Prophylaxis is important although the effectiveness and the best way to achieve
it remain unclear. Recommendations are herein presented. The diagnosis is based
on clinical, bacteriological, and echocardiographic findings mainly based on
Duke's criteria. Transthoracic and transesophageal echography are not only of
diagnostic value but are also a tool to determine the therapy to follow.
Antibiotic therapy should be selected according to the organisms isolated and
their in vitro susceptibility. Guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy in
cases of negative cultures are also included. Lastly, indications and time for
surgery are discussed.
