Prosthetic joint infections represent a major therapeutic challenge for both
healthcare providers and patients. This article reviews the predisposing factors,
pathogenesis, microbiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of prosthetic
joint infection. The most optimal management strategy should be identified on the
basis of a number of considerations, including type and duration of infection,
antimicrobial susceptibility of the infecting pathogen, condition of infected
tissues and bone stock, patient wishes, and functional status.
