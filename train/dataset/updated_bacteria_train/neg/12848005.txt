abscesses of the liver. We have treated between 1990 and 2000 in our service, 38 
patient for abscess of the liver. The symptoms are dominated by the pain of the
right hypochondria (37 cases) and the fever (34 cases). An unique abscess has
been recovered in 25 cases. Some multiple localizations have been observed in 12 
cases. 21 patients have been operated. The bacteriological study at all patients 
revealed the presence of germ in 27 cases. In 6 cases, there were two germs. It
was a bacillus negative gram in 26 cases and a cocci positive gram in 7 cases.
Six complications have been observed at the operated patients. In 5 cases, it was
a septic shock having leads to the death. After survey univariate and
multivariate the only factor of bad prognostic recovered is the septic shock. The
aetiology was identified in only 9 cases; it was abscess cholangiotis.
