During the past decade in the United States, Streptococcus pneumoniae has changed
dramatically in the context of antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to multiple
different antibiotic classes including beta-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins,
and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations), macrolides, clindamycin, the
tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has
emerged at high rates with this important respiratory tract pathogen. There is no
question that the in vitro activity of these antimicrobial agents is
substantially lower for many strains of S. pneumoniae than it was even a few
years ago. The larger question is, however, what does this decrease in activity
mean from a clinical perspective? Stated another way, does resistance defined
according to current standards in the laboratory, translate into diminished
effectiveness when these agents are used to treat patients with pneumococcal
infections? It is this question that serves as the principal basis for this
review.
