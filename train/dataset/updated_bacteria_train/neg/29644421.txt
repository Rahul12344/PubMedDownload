Rat bite fever due to Streptobacillus moniliformis induces typical but not
pathognomonic clinical signs, such as local purulent wound infection followed by 
maculopapular exanthema, myalgia as well as purulent joint infections. Severe
complications, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis are possible. it seems that
this infection is rarely diagnosed but this infection could be much more common
because the final diagnostic proof is difficult to achieve. Firstly, the culture 
of these bacteria is critical because the bacteria are fastidious and secondly
the exact differentiation of the isolates is hardly possible by standard
laboratory methods. Modern techniques such as mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and
molecular biology allow a precise clarification. Surgical cleansing of infection 
sites in combination with a rational antibiotic therapy, for example with
beta-lactam antibiotics, are generally able to cure the infection if treatment is
started early enough. In addition, vaccinations, for example against tetanus and 
rabies have to be considered in this situation as for all other bite wound
infections.
