The interaction between signaling pathways is a central question in the study of 
organogenesis. Using the developing murine tongue as a model, we uncovered
unknown relationships between Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and retinoic acid (RA)
signaling. Genetic loss of SHH signaling leads to enhanced RA activity subsequent
to loss of SHH-dependent expression of Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1. This causes a cell
identity switch, prompting the epithelium of the tongue to form heterotopic minor
salivary glands and to overproduce oversized taste buds. At developmental stages 
during which Wnt10b expression normally ceases and Shh becomes confined to taste 
bud cells, loss of SHH inputs causes the lingual epithelium to undergo an ectopic
and anachronic expression of Shh and Wnt10b in the basal layer, specifying de
novo taste placode induction. Surprisingly, in the absence of SHH signaling,
lingual epithelial cells adopted a Merkel cell fate, but this was not caused by
enhanced RA signaling. We show that RA promotes, whereas SHH, acting strictly
within the lingual epithelium, inhibits taste placode and lingual gland formation
by thwarting RA activity. These findings reveal key functions for SHH and RA in
cell fate specification in the lingual epithelium and aid in deciphering the
molecular mechanisms that assign cell identity.
