The aluminum hydroxide gel, propolis and oil adjuvant inactivated vaccines were
developed by silecting good immunity, representing principal epidemic serotype I 
GVF44 of Gardnerella vaginalis of fox in civil. The results showed that the
aluminum hydroxide gel vaccine in safety was better than propolis and oil
adjuvant vaccines, the most optimal inactivated concentration of formalin is
0.1%. Efficient immunity doses are 4 billon bacteria/1 ml. There were on any bad 
influences to occur for fox after the aluminum hydroxide gel of three times
immunity doses were injected. The inoculated foxes could resist challenge of a
hundred ID50 virulent strains after the vaccine was injected to foxes for 21 d.
Immunity period of the vaccine is 6 months storage period is 10 months at 4-10
degrees C. The field experiments confirmed that the vaccine possessed accuracy,
stability and reliability.
