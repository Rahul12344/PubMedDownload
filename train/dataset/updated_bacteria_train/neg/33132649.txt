BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that is
difficult to diagnose and treat. To date, the degree of inflammation in patients 
with UC has mainly been determined by measuring the levels of nonspecific
indicators, such as C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
but these indicators have an unsatisfactory specificity. In this study, we
performed bioinformatics analysis using data from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information-Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) databases and
verified the selected core genes in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis.
AIM: To identify UC-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using a
bioinformatics analysis and verify them in vivo and to identify novel biomarkers 
and the underlying mechanisms of UC.
METHODS: Two microarray datasets from the NCBI-GEO database were used, and DEGs
between patients with UC and healthy controls were analyzed using GEO2R and Venn 
diagrams. We annotated these genes based on their functions and signaling
pathways, and then protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were identified using the 
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes. The data were further
analyzed with Cytoscape software and the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) app.
The core genes were selected and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Finally, colitis model mice were
established by administering DSS, and the top three core genes were verified in
colitis mice using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-seven DEGs, 118 upregulated and 59
downregulated, were initially identified from the GEO2R analysis and
predominantly participated in inflammation-related pathways. Seven clusters with 
close interactions in UC formed: Seventeen core genes were upregulated [C-X-C
motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2),
CXCL9, CXCL5, C-C motif chemokine ligand 18, interleukin 1 beta, matrix
metallopeptidase 9, CXCL3, formyl peptide receptor 1, complement component 3,
CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL11 and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3]
and one was downregulated [neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NYP1R)] in the top cluster
according to the PPI and MCODE analyses. These genes were substantially enriched 
in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathways.
The top three core genes (CXCL13, NYP1R, and CXCR2) were selected and verified in
a mouse model of colitis using real-time PCR Increased expression was observed
compared with the control mice, but only CXCR2 expression was significantly
different.
CONCLUSION: Core DEGs identified in UC are related to inflammation and immunity
inflammation, indicating that these reactions are core features of the
pathogenesis of UC. CXCR2 may reflect the degree of inflammation in patients with
UC.
