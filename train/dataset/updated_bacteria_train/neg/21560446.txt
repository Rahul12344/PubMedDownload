A short overview is presented of some of the persistent questions of the
relationship of Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease and about 
the increasing number of patients with idiopathic peptic ulcer disease. The
relationship between the decrease of the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in
countries with marked decrease of Helicobacter pylori prevalence in the general
population, including the Czech Republic, was discussed. Several possible causes 
of the decrease in Helicobacter pylori prevalence were noted (improving of
socioeconomic conditions, such as low income and poor education, such as poor
sanitation and overcrowding, bad hygienic conditions especially during childhood,
the marked increase of Helicobacter pylori eradication rate, associated also with
an extended therapy by macrolides or other antibiotics (amoxicillin, etc.) used
for several conditions, often at a very young age, and sometimes by chance
together with proton pump inhibitors, natural loss of the older generation, which
had a higher HP-prevalence than the general population, the change of the stomach
microbiome, etc.) but with the implication, that the real cause of these deep
changes remains indistinctly identified.
