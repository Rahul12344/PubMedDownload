Direct hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of hydroxy fatty acid in lipid a of
Pseudomonas ovalis.

Kawahara K, Uchida K, Aida K.

It was found that Pseudomonas ovalis IAM 1177 had an abundance of hydroxy fatty
acids such as 3-hydroxy-decanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid and
2-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid in the lipophilic part of the lipopolysaccharide
fraction, which comprise 80% of total fatty acids. By using 18O2, it was shown
that one oxygen atom from molecular oxygen was incorporated into
2-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid, but not into 3-hydroxy-decanoic acid. The incorporated
oxygen atom was specifically located at the hydroxyl group of
2-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid. The biosynthetic pathways of these hydroxy fatty acids
are discussed.
