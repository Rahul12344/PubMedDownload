Here we investigate the dynamics of the hepatic intravascular immune response to 
a pathogen relevant to invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells). Immobilized
Kupffer cells with highly ramified extended processes into multiple sinusoids
could effectively capture blood-borne, disseminating Borrelia burgdorferi,
creating a highly efficient surveillance and filtering system. After ingesting B.
burgdorferi, Kupffer cells induced chemokine receptor CXCR3-dependent clustering 
of iNKT cells. Kupffer cells and iNKT cells formed stable contacts via the
antigen-presenting molecule CD1d, which led to iNKT cell activation. An absence
of iNKT cells caused B. burgdorferi to leave the blood and enter the joints more 
effectively. B. burgdorferi that escaped Kupffer cells entered the liver
parenchyma and survived despite Ito cell responses. Kupffer cell-iNKT cell
interactions induced a key intravascular immune response that diminished the
dissemination of B. burgdorferi.
