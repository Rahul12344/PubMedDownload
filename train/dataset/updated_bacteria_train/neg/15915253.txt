An understanding of chemotaxis at the level of cell-molecule interactions is
important because of its relevance in cancer, immunology, and microbiology, just 
to name a few. This study quantifies the effects of flow on cell migration during
chemotaxis in a microfluidic device. The chemotaxis gradient within the device
was modeled and compared to experimental results. Chemotaxis experiments were
performed using the chemokine CXCL8 under different flow rates with human HL60
promyelocytic leukemia cells expressing a transfected CXCR2 chemokine receptor.
Cell trajectories were separated into x and y axis components. When the
microchannel flow rates were increased, cell trajectories along the x axis were
found to be significantly affected (p < 0.05). Total migration distances were not
affected. These results should be considered when using similar microfluidic
devices for chemotaxis studies so that flow bias can be minimized. It may be
possible to use this effect to estimate the total tractile force exerted by a
cell during chemotaxis, which would be particularly valuable for cells whose
tractile forces are below the level of detection with standard techniques of
traction-force microscopy.
