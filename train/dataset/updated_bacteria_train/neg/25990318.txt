BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus fermentum is economically important in the production
and preservation of fermented foods. A repeatable and discriminative typing
method was devised to characterize L. fermentum at the molecular level. The
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme developed was based on analysis of the
internal sequence of 11 housekeeping gene fragments (clpX, dnaA, dnaK, groEL,
murC, murE, pepX, pyrG, recA, rpoB, and uvrC).
RESULTS: MLST analysis of 203 isolates of L. fermentum from Mongolia and seven
provinces/ autonomous regions in China identified 57 sequence types (ST), 27 of
which were represented by only a single isolate, indicating high genetic
diversity. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of the 11 housekeeping
gene fragments indicated that the L. fermentum isolates analyzed belonged to two 
major groups. A standardized index of association (I A (S)) indicated a weak
clonal population structure in L. fermentum. Split decomposition analysis
indicated that recombination played an important role in generating the genetic
diversity observed in L. fermentum. The results from the minimum spanning tree
strongly suggested that evolution of L. fermentum STs was not correlated with
geography or food-type.
CONCLUSIONS: The MLST scheme developed will be valuable for further studies on
the evolution and population structure of L. fermentum isolates used in food
products.
