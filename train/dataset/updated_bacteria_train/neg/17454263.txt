Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes that
recognizes glycolipid antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex 
class I-related protein CD1d. Although iNKT cells have received a lot of
attention as targets for the development of immunotherapies, few studies have
investigated the in vivo response of iNKT cells to glycolipid antigen activation.
Accumulating evidence indicates that iNKT cells generate a dynamic response to in
vivo activation by glycolipid antigens that is characterized by surface receptor 
downmodulation, expansion, cytokine production, cross talk with other cells,
homeostatic contraction, and acquisition of an anergic phenotype. These studies
provide new insight into the biology of iNKT cells and have important
implications for designing safe and effective iNKT cell-based vaccines and
therapies.
