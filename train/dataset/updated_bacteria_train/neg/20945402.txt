BACKGROUND: For redirecting T-lymphocytes to induce prostate cancer cell lysis,
we constructed a novel bispecific single-chain (bsc) diabody directed to the
prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the T-cell receptor
(TCR)-associated CD3 molecule on T-cells.
METHODS: The PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody was generated from an anti-CD3 single chain
Fv fragment (scFv) and the anti-PSMA scFv D7. It was expressed in E. coli and
purified from the periplasmic extract and culture supernatant by immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The binding properties were tested on
PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells and PSMA-negative cell lines as well as on 
Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. For in vitro functional analysis, a cell
viability test (WST-1) was used and activation of T-cells was determined by
measuring the surface marker expression of CD25 and CD69. For in vivo evaluation,
the diabody was administered in combination with human peripheral blood
lymphocytes (Ly) in a C4-2 xenograft-SCID mouse model.
RESULTS: Specific binding of the PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody both to CD3-positive
Jurkat cells and PSMA-expressing C4-2 cells was shown by flow cytometry. In
vitro, the PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody proved to be a potent agent for retargeting
CD4+ and CD8+ human lymphocytes to lyse C4-2 prostate cancer cells. Treatment of 
SCID mice bearing C4-2 tumor xenografts with the diabody and human lymphocytes
efficiently inhibited tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody bears a high potential for the
immunotherapy of prostate cancer.
