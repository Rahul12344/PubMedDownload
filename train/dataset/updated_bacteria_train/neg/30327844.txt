KEY MESSAGE: This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing co-segregating
markers and identifying candidate genes for Fusarium crown rot resistance in
barley based on the generation and exploitation of a near-isogenic line-derived
large population. Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a chronic and severe disease in
cereals in semi-arid regions worldwide. Previous studies showed that FCR
assessment could be affected by many factors including plant height, growth rate 
as well as drought stress. Thus, accurate assessment, which is essential for
detailed mapping of any locus conferring FCR resistance, is difficult. Targeting 
one of the resistance loci reported earlier, we developed a near-isogenic
line-derived population consisting of 1820 F9 lines. By analysing this
population, the Qcrs.cpi-4H locus was mapped to an interval of 0.09 cM covering a
physical distance of about 637 kb and 13 markers co-segregating with the targeted
locus were developed. Candidate genes underlying the resistance locus were
identified by analysing the expression and sequence variation of genes in the
targeted interval. The accurate localization and the development of
co-segregating markers should facilitate the incorporation of this large-effect
QTL into breeding programmes as well as the cloning of gene(s) underlying the
locus.
