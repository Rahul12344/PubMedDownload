The arsenical resistance (ars) operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 encodes an
ATP-driven anion extrusion pump, producing bacterial resistance to arsenicals.
There are three structural genes, of which the product of the middle gene, arsB, 
has not previously been identified. From nucleotide sequence data, the ArsB
protein is predicted to be a 45577 Dalton hydrophobic protein. A mini-Mu
transposition procedure was used to construct an arsB-lacZ gene fusion, producing
a hybrid ArsB-beta-galactosidase protein which was localized in the inner
membrane. The operon was cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase expression vector. In
addition to the previously identified ArsA and ArsC proteins, the cells
synthesized an inner membrane protein with an apparent mass of 36 kD identified
as the ArsB protein.
