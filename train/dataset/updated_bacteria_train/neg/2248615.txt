By means of a thermo exchange apparatus it is possible to recover 70 to 80
percent of warmth of the stable air for heating. Thus much energy for climatizing
can be saved. Alternating directions of to and from air streams may cause
re-influx of germs, dependent on percentage of dust. This risk can be minimized
by using an apparatus each for relatively small units separately.
