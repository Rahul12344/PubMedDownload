Concerns about energy security and global petroleum supply have made the
production of renewable biofuels an industrial imperative. The ideal biofuels are
n-alkanes in that they are chemically and structurally identical to the fossil
fuels and can "drop in" to the transportation infrastructure. In this work, an
Escherichia coli strain that produces n-alkanes was constructed by heterologous
expression of acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (AAR) and aldehyde
deformylating oxygenase (ADO) from Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. The
accumulation of alkanes ranged from 3.1 to 24.0 mg/L using different expressing
strategies. Deletion of yqhD, an inherent aldehyde reductase in E. coli, or
overexpression of fadR, an activator for fatty acid biosynthesis, exhibited a
nearly twofold increase in alkane titers, respectively. Combining yqhD deletion
and fadR overexpression resulted in a production titer of 255.6 mg/L in E. coli, 
and heptadecene was the most abundant product.
