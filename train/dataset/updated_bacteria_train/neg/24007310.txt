Five amino acids (Y105, Y176, Y189, Y189, W207) that constitute the substrate
binding site of PHB depolymerase PhaZ7 were identified. All residues are located 
at a single surface-exposed location of PhaZ7. Exchange of these amino acids by
less hydrophobic, hydrophilic or negatively charged residues reduced binding of
PhaZ7 to PHB. Modifications of other residues at the PhaZ7 surface (F9, Y66,
Y103, Y124, Y169, Y172, Y173, F198, Y203, Y204, F251, W252) had no effect on
substrate binding. The PhaZ7 wild-type protein, three muteins with single amino
acid exchanges (Y105A, Y105E, Y190E), a PhaZ7 variant with deletion of residues
202-208, and PhaZ7 in which the active-site serine had been replaced by alanine
(S136A) were crystallized and their structures were determined at 1.6-2.0 Å
resolution. The structures were almost identical but revealed flexibility of some
regions. Structural analysis of PhaZ7 (S136A) with bound 3-hydroxybutyrate
tetramer showed that the substrate binds in a cleft that is composed of Y105,
Y176, Y189 and Y190 and thus confirmed the data obtained by site-directed
mutagenesis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first example in which the 
substrate binding site of a PHB depolymerase is documented at a molecular and
structural level.
