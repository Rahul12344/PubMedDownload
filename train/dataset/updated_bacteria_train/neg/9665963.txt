There is great interest in characterizing the proteins of the gastric pathogen
Helicobacter pylori, especially those to which humans respond immunologically,
because of the potential importance of such proteins in diagnosis and vaccine
development. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to separate and
identify potential antigens of H. pylori ATCC 43504. Over 30 proteins were
reactive in Western blots with pooled sera from 14 infected patients. These
proteins were analyzed by N-terminal sequence analysis. Fourteen proteins were
determined to be distinct from any proteins previously described from H. pylori; 
the others were previously isolated and characterized proteins. Analysis of eight
distinct H. pylori strains showed that most of these antigens were produced by
all of the strains. We propose that collection of new antigens such as those
recognized here will be useful in serologic tests for detecting and monitoring H.
pylori infection and may also serve as potential targets for antimicrobial agent 
or vaccine development.
