OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features and therapeutic effects of fungal
keratitis (FK).
METHODS: 110 cases (110 eyes) with the disease were divided into two types:
hyphomycetic keratitis in 94 eyes and candida keratitis in 16 eyes. The clinical 
features and therapeutic effects of the two types were observed and compared.
RESULTS: The hyphomycetic keratitis generally had a plant traumatic history. The 
border of corneal infiltration was not clear with feather edges, and had a
tendency to penetrate into the deep stroma of cornea. There were endothelial
plaques, hypopyon and bad therapeutic effects. The pathogenicity of cardida
keratitis (CK) was related to the local long-term use of glucocorticoid, the
fungus seldom expanded into the deep corneal layers and infiltrated into the
inner eye. Its therapeutic effects were better. The border of CK was
characterized with limitations, and was clear.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of the two types are different. The clinical
features caused by different or the same pathogenic fungi show great variations. 
Early diagnoses, correct use of medicine and operation are the key points to
increase the curative rate.
