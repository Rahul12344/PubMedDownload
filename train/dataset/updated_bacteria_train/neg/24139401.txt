The Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxin ED (LukED) is a pore-forming toxin required 
for the lethality associated with bacteremia in murine models. LukED targets the 
chemokine receptor CCR5 to kill T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. 
LukED also kills CCR5-deficient cells, like neutrophils, suggesting the existence
of additional cellular receptors. Here, we identify the chemokine receptors CXCR1
and CXCR2 as the targets of LukED on neutrophils. The LukE subunit binds
neutrophils in a specific and saturable manner, and this interaction is inhibited
by CXCL8, the high-affinity endogenous ligand of CXCR1 and CXCR2. LukED
recognition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 promotes the killing of monocytes and neutrophils 
in vitro. LukED-mediated targeting of CXCR1 and CXCR2(+) cells contributes to
S. aureus pathogenesis and facilitates lethality in systemically infected mice.
Thus, LukED is a versatile toxin that endows S. aureus with the ability to
simultaneously disarm both innate and adaptive compartments of the host immune
response.
