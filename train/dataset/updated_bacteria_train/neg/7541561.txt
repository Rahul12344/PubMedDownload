Mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells provide a system to study developmentally
regulated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression. AFP is not expressed in
undifferentiated F9 cells but is induced when cells differentiate as cell
aggregates in the presence of retinoic acid. Previous studies have led to the
suggestion that undifferentiated F9 cells contain negative regulators of AFP
expression. To test this, we have used transient heterokaryons to ask whether
inactive AFP genes in undifferentiated F9 cells are responsive to positively
acting trans-acting factors. Our results indicate that silent endogenous and
transfected AFP genes are activated when undifferentiated F9 cells are fused to
human hepatoma HepG2 cells. This suggests that the lack of AFP expression in
undifferentiated F9 cells is due to the absence or insufficient level of
positive-acting transcription factors, rather than the presence of dominant
negative regulators. We also demonstrate that stably transfected AFP genes,
although unmethylated, are properly regulated in F9 cells.
