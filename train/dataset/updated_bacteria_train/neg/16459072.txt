Pathogenic bacteria have evolved sophisticated strategies to overcome host
defences, to interact with the immune system and to interfere with essential host
systems. We coin the term 'patho-biotechnology' to describe the exploitation of
these valuable traits in biotechnology, medicine and food. This approach shows
promise for the development of novel vaccine and drug delivery systems, as well
as for the design of more technologically robust and effective probiotic cultures
with improved biotechnological and clinical applications. The genetic
tractability of Listeria monocytogenes, the availability of the complete genome
sequence of this intracellular pathogen, its ability to cope with stress, and its
ability to traverse the gastrointestinal tract and induce a strong cellular
immune response make L. monocytogenes an ideal model organism for demonstrating
the patho-biotechnology concept.
