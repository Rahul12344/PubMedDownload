Various clinical presentations have been ascribed to Helicobacter (H.) pylori.
Most importantly, H. pylori is considered the leading cause of gastric cancer
worldwide and because of that, in adult population, it is listed as a number one 
carcinogen. However, children are less prone to develop H. pylori related serious
diseases such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and cases of malignancy are only
sporadically reported. On the other hand, there is an increasing level of
evidence suggesting that H. pylori in children could also have a beneficial
effect. Recently, several data confirmed previously described inverse
relationship of H. pylori infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that an increased prevalence of allergic
diseases could be, at least partially, explained by the decreased incidence of H.
pylori infection. H. pylori can, to some degree, influence immunological
response. It has an ability to promote high proinflammatory cytokine expression
in the gastric mucosa shifting immunity towards Th1 response, which could be a
plausible explanation for the down-regulated clinical expression of allergies
(including asthma) in patients with H. pylori gastritis. Based on these findings 
the aim of this review is to present "pros and cons" for H. pylori eradication in
children.
