Urinary tract infection (UTI) continues to be a common nosocomial infection. From
a 2-year city-county hospital experience, 212 nosocomial UTI were identified in
153 patients from 3747 admissions. Mean age was 54 years; 102 were men. Foley
catheterization was an associated factor in 129 patients (84%). UTI was caused by
40 different species of bacteria. In 28 infections (13%), the UTI was
polymicrobial. Only nine patients had bacteremia. The bacteriology of the UTI
depended on whether the patient had received systemic antibiotics previously
during the hospitalization. Prior antibiotic administration increased the
probability of Pseudomonas and Serratia as pathogens. Thus, patients that have
had antibiotic therapy demonstrate a distribution of pathogens that are different
from patients not receiving antibiotics, and a distribution different from the
community-acquired UTI. Continued emphasis on the shorter duration and more
judicious use of systemic antibiotics for both prophylaxis and therapy is
warranted.
