Mutagen screening by a simplified bacterial fluctuation test: use of microsomal
preparations and whole liver cells for metabolic activation.

We describe the use of a simplified bacterial fluctuation test to detect induced 
mutation, either incorporating liver microsomal or whole liver cell preparations.
We have evaluated both types of test using three agents. The fluctuation assay
seems somewhat slower, simpler and more sensitive than a conventional plating
test with microsomes. A whole cell preparation appears marginally more effective 
than a microsomal fraction for metabolic activation of
9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, but rather less effective for benz(a)pyrene and
2-acetamidofluorene. Ultimately the usefulness of activation by whole cells may
depend upon whether the method can give a correlation with carcinogenicity that
is more quantitative than microsome methods and better reflects organ and species
specificity.
