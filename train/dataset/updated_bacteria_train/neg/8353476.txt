During 2 years and 9 months, 74 patients were hospitalized to purulent meningitis
at the Hospital of Brazzaville and 33 were bacteriologically confirmed. The
pneumococcus was responsible in 24 cases (33.4%). The analysis of 74 files showed
that 34 patients died, 40 were completely cured without any after effect. The
factors for these bad prognosis are: the presence of signs of cerebral pains; a
CSF cytology inferior to 500 cells/mm3; total CSF proteins inferior to 2 g/l and 
the time before hospitalisation superior to 5 days.
