A novel wastewater treatment system consisting of an up-flow anaerobic sludge
blanket (UASB) reactor and a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor with
sulfur-redox reaction was developed for treatment of municipal sewage under
low-temperature conditions. In the UASB reactor, a novel phenomenon of anaerobic 
sulfur oxidation occurred in the absence of oxygen, nitrite and nitrate as
electron acceptors. The microorganisms involved in anaerobic sulfur oxidation
have not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we studied the microbial
communities existing in the UASB reactor that probably enhanced anaerobic sulfur 
oxidation. Sludge samples collected from the UASB reactor before and after sulfur
oxidation were used for cloning and terminal restriction fragment length
polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacterial and
archaeal domains. The microbial community structures of bacteria and archaea
indicated that the genus Smithella and uncultured bacteria within the phylum
Caldiserica were the dominant bacteria groups. Methanosaeta spp. was the dominant
group of the domain archaea. The T-RFLP analysis, which was consistent with the
cloning results, also yielded characteristic fingerprints for bacterial
communities, whereas the archaeal community structure yielded stable microbial
community. From these results, it can be presumed that these major bacteria
groups, genus Smithella and uncultured bacteria within the phylum Caldiserica,
probably play an important role in sulfur oxidation in UASB reactors.
