Cloning and mapping of infA, the gene for protein synthesis initiation factor
IF1.

The gene for translation initiation factor IF1, infA, has been identified by
using two synthetic oligonucleotides to screen a Charon 30 library of Escherichia
coli DNA. A recombinant lambda phage, C1921, was purified from a plaque positive 
for both probes. A 2.8 kb BglII fragment and a 2.0 kb HindIII fragment isolated
from C1921 were subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pBR322 to yield
pTB7 and pTH2 respectively. Synthesis of IF1 in maxicells transformed with pTB7
or pTH2 indicates the presence of inf A in both inserts. This was confirmed by
DNA sequencing: a region was found that codes for a 8,119 dalton protein with an 
amino acid sequence corresponding to IF1. The chromosomal location of inf A was
determined by mapping the closely linked beta-lactamase gene (Ampr) in pTB7 and
pTH2. pTB7 and pTH2 were transformed into polA Hfr hosts, and integration of the 
plasmid by homologous recombination near inf A was selected on the basis of
ampicillin resistance. The site of integration was confirmed by Southern blot
analysis of restriction nuclease digested wild type and transformed genomic DNA. 
The Ampr marker (and therefore inf A) was mapped to about 20 minutes by Hfr
interrupted matings and P1 transduction experiments. The structure and regulation
of the inf A operon currently are being investigated.
