Antibodies recognizing the non-adhesive minor P-fimbral subunit protein E and the
P-fimbrial adhesin were used in an immunocytochemical analysis of P-fimbrial
structure. It was demonstrated that P-fimbriae of the serotypes F71, F72 and F11 
carry their adhesin in a complex with protein E. These complexes are commonly
found at the tip of the fimbrial structure. In P-fimbriae of serotype F9,
expressed by the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 21086, adhesin-protein E
complexes are localized at the tips as well as along the shafts of the fimbriae. 
Protein E of F71 fimbriae (FsoE) plays a catalysing role in the biogenesis of the
adhesin, but has no effect on the eventual localization of the adhesin.
