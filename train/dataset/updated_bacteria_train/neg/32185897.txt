Pioneer work by Prof. Cossart among others, studying the interactions between
pathogenic bacteria and host cells (this discipline was termed Cellular
Microbiology), was fundamental to determine the bacterial infection processes and
to improve our knowledge of different cellular mechanisms. The study of
bacteria-host interactions also involves in vivo host immune responses, which can
be manipulated by bacteria, being these last potent tools for different
immunotherapies. During the last years, tumour immunotherapies, mainly the use of
antibodies that target immune checkpoints [checkpoint inhibitors (CPI)], have
been a revolution in oncology, allowing the treatment of tumours otherwise with
very bad prognosis. In the same direction, bacteria inoculations have been used
from long to treat some cancers; for example, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
can be successfully treated with the bacterium Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG).
More recently, it has been shown that microbiota could determine the success of
CPI immunotherapies and intense research is being performed in order to use
bacteria as immunotherapy tools due to their ability to activate the immune
system. In this context, to expand the knowledge of the bacteria-immune system
interactions will be fundamental to improve tumour immunotherapies.
