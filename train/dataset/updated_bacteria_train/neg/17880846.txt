A careful balance between the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory response is
vital in order to survive the daily invasion of pathogens. Sepsis has always been
regarded as the result of an exacerbated detrimental inflammatory response
towards invading bacteria. However, recent insights have forced us to rethink
this sepsis paradigm. This review discusses the latest trends and developments in
the sepsis field and helps to set the stage for the current debate on whether the
sepsis response is good or bad.
