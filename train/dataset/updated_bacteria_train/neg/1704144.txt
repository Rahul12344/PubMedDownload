An anion-translocating ATPase has been identified as the product of the arsenical
resistance operon of resistance plasmid R773. When expressed in Escherichia coli 
this ATP-driven oxyanion pump catalyses extrusion of the oxyanions arsenite,
antimonite and arsenate. Maintenance of a low intracellular concentration of
oxyanion produces resistance to the toxic agents. The pump is composed of two
polypeptides, the products of the arsA and arsB genes. This two-subunit enzyme
produces resistance to arsenite and antimonite. A third gene, arsC, expands the
substrate specificity to allow for arsenate pumping and resistance.
