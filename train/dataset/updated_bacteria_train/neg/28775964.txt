Obesity and dental caries are increasingly widespread pathologies. The former is 
growing so rapidly that the WHO classified its trend as an "epidemic". Both are
triggered by a number of well known common etiologic factors sharing also the
high added sugar amount since childhood. Because of its fermentation and pH
lowering, dietary sugar allows the cariogenic bacteria to damage the tooth enamel
provoking the carious lesions. WHO guidelines recommend reducing sugar intake to 
10% of the total daily energy need, and highlight that there is evidence which
suggests cuttingthis value down to 5% at least. The American guidelines
addressing paediatric age put the limit to 25gr a day with a total ban on sugar
in those aged 2 or less.
