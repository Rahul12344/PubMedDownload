Comment in
    Nat Rev Immunol. 2014 May;14(5):286.

Mast cells (MCs) mature locally, thus possessing tissue-dependent phenotypes for 
their critical roles in both protective immunity against pathogens and the
development of allergy or inflammation. We previously reported that MCs highly
express P2X7, a receptor for extracellular ATP, in the colon but not in the skin.
The ATP-P2X7 pathway induces MC activation and consequently exacerbates the
inflammation. Here, we identified the mechanisms by which P2X7 expression on MCs 
is reduced by fibroblasts in the skin, but not in the other tissues. The
retinoic-acid-degrading enzyme Cyp26b1 is highly expressed in skin fibroblasts,
and its inhibition resulted in the upregulation of P2X7 on MCs. We also noted the
increased expression of P2X7 on skin MCs and consequent P2X7- and MC-dependent
dermatitis (so-called retinoid dermatitis) in the presence of excessive amounts
of retinoic acid. These results demonstrate a unique skin-barrier homeostatic
network operating through Cyp26b1-mediated inhibition of ATP-dependent MC
activation by fibroblasts.
