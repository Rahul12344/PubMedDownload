Acidithiobacillus caldus is a moderately thermophilic, acidophilic bacterium that
has been reported to be the dominant sulfur oxidizer in stirred-tank processes
used to treat gold-bearing arsenopyrite ores. It is also widely distributed in
heap reactors used for the extraction of metals from ores. Not only are these
bacteria commercially important, they have an interesting physiology, the study
of which has been restricted by the nonavailability of defined mutants. A
recently reported conjugation system based on the broad-host-range IncW plasmids 
pSa and R388 was used to transfer mobilizable narrow-host-range suicide plasmid
vectors containing inactivated and partially deleted chromosomal genes from
Escherichia coli to A. caldus. Through the dual use of a selectable kanamycin
resistance gene and a hybridization probe made from a deleted portion of the
target chromosomal gene, single- and double-recombinant mutants of A. caldus were
isolated. The functionality of the gene inactivation system was shown by the
construction of A. caldus arsB and tetH mutants, and the effects of these
mutations on cell growth in the presence of arsenic and by means of tetrathionate
oxidation were demonstrated.
