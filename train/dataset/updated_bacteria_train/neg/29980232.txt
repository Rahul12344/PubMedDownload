OBJECTIVE: Over the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion of the trendy
water pipe smoking around the world especially among younger adults. The initial 
objective of this study was to identify the microbiota of the shisha, which may
either be of no harm for the smoker or enhance the threat on his well-being. The 
total DNA for the metagenomics study was conducted on three different shishas
from three different delivery shops in Jounieh, Lebanon. The microbiota in two
solid parts of the shisha, shaft and hose, were analysed including the fresh
tobacco and the water in the bowl. All samples were analysed using
high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons.
RESULTS: Overall, more than 40 bacterial genera were found in the three
investigated shishas, some are commensal others are pathogenic. All three shishas
showed similar microbial content regarding the bacteria inhabiting in water,
shaft, or hose. From the results of this study it appears that a very large
quantity of bacteria was found in the water pipes, some are harmful and others
beneficial. We assume that the presence of gut dependent microbiota is related to
the loose hygienic conditions in which the shisha is prepared.
