I assayed the lack of reactivity of monoclonal antibody (MAb) F9-4 with
nonpathogenic leptospires. Of 47 saprophytic strains tested, 46 did not react in 
an enzyme immunoassay and 1 was recognized by MAb F9-4, as usually reported with 
pathogenic Leptospira strains. On the other hand, the MAb did not react with one 
pathogenic strain, thus showing that the ability of MAb F9-4 to discriminate
between pathogenic and nonpathogenic leptospires is not absolute.
