In studies aimed at developing a high affinity IL-8 antagonist, our first
objective was to generate a high-affinity IL-8 analogue. We targeted amino acids 
within the receptor-binding domain and found that IL-8((3-73))K11R induced
significantly more neutrophil beta-glucuronidase release than either IL-8 or the 
alternate analogues and, in chemotaxis assays, induced 2-3-fold greater
neutrophil responses than IL-8. Furthermore, in competitive radio- or
biotinylated-ligand binding assays, IL-8((3-73))K11R was more effective than
IL-8, IL-8((3-73)), or its T12S, H13F, and K11R/T12S/H13F analogues in blocking
IL-8 binding to neutrophils; 1.8 pmol IL-8((3-73))K11R inhibited by 50% the
binding of approximately 20 pmol (125)I-IL-8 to neutrophils. Both IL-8 (a
CXCR1/CXCR2 ligand) and the CXCR2-specific ligand GROalpha differentially
inhibited binding of (125)I-IL-8((3-73))K11R to neutrophils, albeit weakly,
suggesting that IL-8((3-73))K11R is a high affinity ligand for both the CXCR1 and
CXCR2. Thus IL-8((3-73))K11R is an excellent candidate for further studies aimed 
at generating a high affinity IL-8 antagonist.
