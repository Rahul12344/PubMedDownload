The key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of glycosaminoglycan production are
represented by the human xylosyltransferase I and its isoform II (XylT-I and
XylT-II). The glycosaminoglycan heparin interacts with a variety of proteins,
thereby regulating their activities, also those of xylosyltransferases. The
identification of unknown amino acids responsible for heparin-binding of XylT-II 
was addressed in this study. Thus, six XylT-II fragments were designed as fusion 
proteins with MBP and we received soluble and purified MBP/XylT-II from
Escherichia coli. Heparin-binding studies showed that all fragments bound with
low affinity to heparin. Prolonging of XylT-II fragments did not account for a
cooperative effect of multiple heparin-binding motifs and in turn for a stronger 
heparin-binding. Sequence alignment and surface polarity plot led to the
identification of two highly positively charged Cardin-Weintraub motifs with
surface accessibility, resulting in combination with short clusters of basic
amino acids for strong heparin-binding of native xylosyltransferases.
