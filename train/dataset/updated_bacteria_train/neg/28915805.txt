Antibiotic natural products are ancient and so is resistance. Consequently,
environmental bacteria harbor numerous and varied antibiotic resistance elements.
Nevertheless, despite long histories of antibiotic production and exposure,
environmental bacteria are not resistant to all known antibiotics. This means
that there are barriers to the acquisition of a complete resistance
armamentarium. The sources, distribution, and movement of resistance mechanisms
in different microbes and bacterial populations are mosaic features that act as
barriers to slow this movement, thus moderating the emergence of bacterial
pan-resistance. This is highly relevant to understanding the emergence of
resistance in pathogenic bacteria that can inform better antibiotic management
practices and influence new drug discovery.
