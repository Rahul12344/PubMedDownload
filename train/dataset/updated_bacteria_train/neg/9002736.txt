Halitosis is caused primarily by bacterial putrefaction and the generation of
volatile sulfur compounds. Ninety percent of patients suffering from halitosis
have oral causes, such as poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, tongue coat,
food impaction, unclean dentures, faulty restorations, oral carcinomas, and
throat infections. The remaining 10 percent of halitosis sufferers have systemic 
causes that include renal or hepatic failure, carcinomas, diabetes or
trimethylaminuria. Modern analytical and microbiological techniques permit
diagnosis of bad breath. Management of halitosis involves maintaining proper oral
hygiene, and periodontal treatment, including tongue brushing.
