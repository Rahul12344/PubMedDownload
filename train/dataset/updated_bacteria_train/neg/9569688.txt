Biodegradation of geosmin produced by Streptomyces halstedii (A-1 strain) was
investigated using seven Gram-positive bacteria. Bacterial action on the A-1
extract was followed at 15, 45 and 120 min. Bacillus cereus ssp. thuringiensis
HD-1, B. cereus 3711 and B. cereus ssp. mycoides 4379 showed no effect. However, 
Arthrobacter atrocyaneus, Arth. globiformis, Chlorophenolicus N-1053 and
Rhodococcus maris caused a colour change from blue to yellow (positive reaction).
These data suggest that geosmin can be degraded by specific species of
Gram-positive bacteria. Biodegradation of geosmin, which causes bad odour in
drinking water, can be used as a new technology in water treatment.
