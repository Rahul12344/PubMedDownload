In order to dissect the pathogenesis of Cryptococcus neoformans
meningoencephalitis, a genomic survey of the changes in gene expression of human 
brain microvascular endothelial cells infected by C. neoformans was carried out
in a time-course study. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significant
fluctuations in the expression levels of different groups of genes during the
pathogen-host interaction. Self-organizing map (SOM) analysis revealed that most 
genes were up- or downregulated 2 folds or more at least at one time point during
the pathogen-host engagement. The microarray data were validated by Western blot 
analysis of a group of genes, including beta-actin, Bcl-x, CD47, Bax, Bad, and
Bcl-2. Hierarchical cluster profile showed that 61 out of 66 listed interferon
genes were changed at least at one time point. Similarly, the active responses in
expression of MHC genes were detected at all stages of the interaction. Taken
together, our infectomic approaches suggest that the host cells significantly
change the gene profiles and also actively participate in immunoregulations of
the central nervous system (CNS) during C. neoformans infection.
