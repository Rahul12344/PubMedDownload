Biosynthesis of vitamin B-12. Part I. Role of the ribosomal proteins in vitamin
B-12 biosynthesis.

Pezacka E, Walerych W.

1. 70 S ribosomes isolated from strains of Escherichia coli 113-3, K12 and B take
part in vitamin B-12 biosynthesis from AdoCbi-GDP, NAD and dimethylbenzimidazole 
in the presence of enzymes of the cytosol fraction. 2. 70 S ribosomes from E.coli
113-3 bind Ado[58Co]Cbi-GDP. This reaction is independent of fusidic acid. 3.
Proteins from 5 S RNA complex as well as l3 protein isolated from E.coli 113-3
ribosomes catalyze vitamin B-12 biosynthesis. The main catalytic function in this
reaction is preformed by protein L18. 4. Vitamin B-12 biosynthesis proceeding in 
the presence of isolated ribosomal proteins is inhibited by fusidic acid,
chloramphenicol and vernamycin but not by erythromycin. 5. Vitamin B-12
synthesized in the presence of isolated ribosomal proteins is biologically
active.
