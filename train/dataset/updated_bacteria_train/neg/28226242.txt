The most lethal form of malaria in humans is caused by Plasmodium falciparum.
These parasites invade erythrocytes, a complex process involving multiple
ligand-receptor interactions. The parasite makes initial contact with the
erythrocyte followed by dramatic deformations linked to the function of the
Erythrocyte binding antigen family and P. falciparum reticulocyte binding-like
families. We show EBA-175 mediates substantial changes in the deformability of
erythrocytes by binding to glycophorin A and activating a phosphorylation cascade
that includes erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins resulting in changes in the
viscoelastic properties of the host cell. TRPM7 kinase inhibitors FTY720 and
waixenicin A block the changes in the deformability of erythrocytes and inhibit
merozoite invasion by directly inhibiting the phosphorylation cascade. Therefore,
binding of P. falciparum parasites to the erythrocyte directly activate a
signaling pathway through a phosphorylation cascade and this alters the
viscoelastic properties of the host membrane conditioning it for successful
invasion.
