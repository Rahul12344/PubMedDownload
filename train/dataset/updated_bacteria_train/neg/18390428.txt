Our laboratory is requested more and more by the establishments of health and the
industrial laundries for the microbiological realization of control on the
textile articles after completion. We checked the effectiveness of the techniques
of the bacteriol prints or rodac and the bacterial extraction after maceration
for the realization of these controls. The output of extraction of the bacteriol 
prints applied to woven material samples sterilized and then artificially
contaminated by a titrated Staphylococcal suspension is lower than 1%. The
technique recommended and largely used for the study in particular of the
contamination of the blouses of doctor in the establishments of health thus does 
not appear to be relevant. We propose for the quality control of the linen a
technique of maceration then extraction by the ultra sounds whose output is
evaluated to 62% which requires to sacrifice the controled textile article. The
choice of the bacteriological techniques as controls ultimate of a procedure must
be carried out carefully to meet the needs for quality. Conclusions, when with
the effectiveness of a process, deduced from results obtained by a bad method
could be wrongfully reassuring.
