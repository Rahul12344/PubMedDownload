The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of aerosol pollution following
dental procedures performed in 15 sessions with an ultrasound scaler and a
bicarbonate cleaner. The air contamination was measured by means of the Surface
Air System method and the "plate" method (Air Microbial Index). Each
colony-forming unit per cubic meter of air was allotted a unit value for
statistical analysis. The data were then compared with the hygienic assessments
made in previous studies. The results showed that the initial environmental
conditions in a dental office initiated at the level of mediocre, then became
very bad during dental procedures, and fell between mediocre and very bad at the 
end of the procedures.
