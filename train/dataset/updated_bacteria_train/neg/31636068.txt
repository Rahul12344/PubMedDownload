!!NCR1!! presents a great challenge to antimycobacterial therapy due to its
innate resistance against most antibiotics. M. abscessus is able to grow
intracellularly in human macrophages, suggesting that intracellular models can
facilitate drug discovery. Thus, we have developed two host cell models: human
macrophages for use in a new high-content screening method for M. abscessus
growth and a Dictyostelium discoideum infection model with the potential to
simplify downstream genetic analysis of host cell factors. A screen of 568
antibiotics for activity against intracellular M. abscessus led to the
identification of two hit compounds with distinct growth inhibition. A collection
of 317 human kinase inhibitors was analyzed, with the results yielding three
compounds with an inhibitory effect on mycobacterial growth, strengthening the
notion that host-directed therapy can be applied for M. abscessus.
