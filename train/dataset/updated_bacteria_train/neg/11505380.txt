A recombinant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (mutant in
propionate-activation activity) was metabolically engineered to control the
composition of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy- valerate) (PHBV), a
polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer with commercially desirable properties. A gene
(prpE) encoding propionyl-CoA synthetase was placed under the control of the
IPTG-inducible taclacUV5 promoter (P(taclacUV5)) while the polyhydroxyalkanoate
synthesis operon (phaBCA) from Acinetobacter sp. RA3849 was coexpressed under the
control of the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter (P(BAD)). S. enterica,
harboring both constructs, was grown in medium containing a fixed substrate
concentration and the composition of the copolymer was varied between 2 mol% and 
25 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate by controlling the IPTG level in the medium. This
"dial-a-composition" system should find application in cases where the substrate 
concentration of a feedstream for PHBV bioplastic production is not adjustable.
