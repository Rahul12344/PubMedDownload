Systemic lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by
inflammation in organs such as kidneys and presence of autoantibodies against
nuclear antigens. We have previously shown that CD1d deficiency in BALB/c mice
exacerbates lupus nephritis and autoantibody production induced by the
hydrocarbon oil pristane. Here, we have tested the impact of activating
CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells on pristane-induced lupus-like
autoimmunity in BALB/c and SJL mice. Repeated in vivo treatment of
pristane-injected BALB/c mice with the NKT cell ligand alpha-galactosylceramide
(alpha-GalCer) prior to the onset of florid disease suppressed proteinuria, in a 
manner that was dependent on CD1d and IL-4 expression. In sharp contrast,
however, similar treatment of pristane-injected SJL mice with alpha-GalCer
resulted in increased proteinuria. Consistent with these dichotomous effects of
NKT cell activation on the development of lupus-like autoimmunity, NKT cells in
BALB/c and SJL/J mice exhibited a mixed Th1/Th2 and a Th1-biased cytokine
production profile, respectively. These findings demonstrate that NKT cell
activation with alpha-GalCer suppresses or promotes pristane-induced lupus-like
autoimmunity in mice, in a strain-dependent manner.
