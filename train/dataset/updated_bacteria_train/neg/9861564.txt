Escherichia coli with high-level fluoroquinolone resistance were isolated from
feces and/or various body sites of 16 cancer patients who were on oral
fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Population analysis of fecal isolates in 11 patients
showed that fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli was the only aerobic gram-negative 
bacillus present and exhibited a relatively homogenous fluoroquinolone MIC
distribution. Molecular typing by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal
DNA digests or by random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting confirmed the
clonal nature of gastrointestinal tract colonization with E. coli. Genotyping of 
ten colonies picked from the same fecal culture demonstrated identical strains in
four of four patients examined. Identical genotypes from the same patient were
isolated over prolonged periods of time in 12 of 12 cases examined, with one
patient (with the longest follow-up of 14 months) who lost his initial genotype
and became persistently colonized with a new genotype. In the 11 patients who
developed infection due to fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, molecular typing
also indicated that fecal colonization was associated with, and presumably
preceded infection due to an indistinguishable genotype of
fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli.
