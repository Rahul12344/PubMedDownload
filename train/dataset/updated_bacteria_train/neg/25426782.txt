Protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires IFNG.
Besides, IFNG-mediated induction of autophagy suppresses survival of virulent Mtb
in macrophage cell lines. We investigated the contribution of autophagy to the
defense against Mtb antigen (Mtb-Ag) in cells from tuberculosis patients and
healthy donors (HD). Patients were classified as high responders (HR) if their T 
cells produced significant IFNG against Mtb-Ag; and low responders (LR) when
patients showed weak or no T cell responses to Mtb-Ag. The highest autophagy
levels were detected in HD cells whereas the lowest quantities were observed in
LR patients. Interestingly, upon Mtb-Ag stimulation, we detected a positive
correlation between IFNG and MAP1LC3B-II/LC3-II levels. Actually, blockage of
Mtb-Ag-induced IFNG markedly reduced autophagy in HR patients whereas addition of
limited amounts of IFNG significantly increased autophagy in LR patients.
Therefore, autophagy collaborates with human immune responses against Mtb in
close association with specific IFNG secreted against the pathogen.
