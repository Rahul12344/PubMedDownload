Dialysis fluid produced by state-of-the-art water preparation and distribution is
contaminated with gram-negative bacteria and cytokine-inducing substances (CIS)
derived from these microorganisms. The presence of a biofilm increases the risk
of continuous contamination of dialysis fluid. Depending on the type of dialyzer 
membrane (cellulosic vs. synthetic) and the mode of dialysis (low flux vs. high
flux with backfiltration), CIS may penetrate intact dialyzer membranes, induce
cytokine production in the patient's blood and contribute to chronic inflammation
associated with long-term hemodialysis therapy. Measures to improve the
microbiological quality of dialysis fluid are: (1) the awareness of the problem
and regular testing of dialysate samples using adequate methods; (2) disinfection
of the entire water preparation and distribution system on a regular basis,
replacement of biofilm-containing tubings, and (3) installation of ultrafilters
in the dialysate circuit in particular when high-flux hemodialysis modalities are
performed.
