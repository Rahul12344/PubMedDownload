Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting about 2% of the Caucasian
population, characterized by co-existing inflammation and epidermal
hyperproliferation. A T-lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune reaction induced by
bacterial superantigens might be central in its pathogenesis. To model
psoriasiform inflammation, we transplanted clinically uninvolved skin from
psoriatic patients onto SCID mice. Repetitive intradermal injections with a
bacterial superantigen and simultaneous intraperitoneal injections with the
patients superantigen-stimulated peripheral mononuclear blood cells resulted in
an inflammatory reaction exhibiting some of the hallmarks of psoriasis, e.g.
epidermal hyperproliferation, papillomatosis, focal neo-expression of ICAMI, and 
an exocytotic T-lymphocytic infiltrate characterized by the expression of the
cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. These observations document the
potential of superantigens to trigger psoriasiform dermatitis and provide a model
to study lymphocyte homing.
