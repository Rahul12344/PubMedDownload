Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) are major activating receptors involved in 
NK cytotoxicity. NCR expression varies with the activation state of NK cells, and
the expression level correlates with NK cells' natural cytotoxicity. In this
study, we found that Gö6983, a PKC inhibitor, induced a remarkable increase of
NCR expression on primary NK cells, but other PKC inhibitors and NK cell
stimulators such as IL-2 and PMA, did not. Gö6983 increased the expression of NCR
in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Gö6983 strongly
upregulated the surface expression of death ligands FasL and TRAIL, but not
cytotoxic molecules perforin and granzyme B. Unlike two other NK stimulating
molecules, IL-2, and PMA, Gö6983 did not induce NK cell proliferation.
Up-regulation of NCRs and death ligands on NK cells by Gö6983 resulted in a
significant enhancement of NK cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines.
Most importantly, administration of Gö6983 effectively inhibited pulmonary tumor 
metastasis in mice in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that Gö6983 
functions as an NK cell activating molecule (NKAM); this NKAM is a novel
anti-cancer and anti-metastasis drug candidate because it enhances NK
cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vivo as well as in vitro.
