Thymol is a phytochemical component present in many plants used as food additive 
in order to promote animal growth due to its several biological properties.
However, possible side effects of thymol remain poorly known limited to few
reports. In this sense, we evaluated the enzymes of the purinergic signaling such
as, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase), 5'-nucleotidase and
adenosine deaminase (ADA), that play an important role on toxicity induced by
excessive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in the extracellular environment. 
Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether purinergic signaling could be
considered a potential target of thymol-induced inflammation, and the toxicity in
tissues and immune cells of mice after thymol administration. NTPDase activity
(ATP as substrate) in serum, spleen, and splenic lymphocytes was lower after 30
days of oral treatment at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of thymol, while ADA
activity was stimulated at 20 and 40 mg/kg. No differences were observed between 
groups regarding NTPDase (ADP as substrate) and 5'-nucleotidase activities in all
evaluated tissues. Based on these evidences, adenine nucleotide hydrolysis is
modified in serum, spleen, and splenic lymphocytes of mice treated with thymol,
contributing to inflammation and toxicity by a reduction on ATP hydrolyses and
its possible accumulation in the extracellular medium and increased Ado
desamination and its possible reduction in the extracellular environment, leading
to a self-sustained pro-inflammatory deleterious cycle. In summary, all tested
thymol concentrations induced inflammation and toxicity in tissues and immune
cells of treated mice.
