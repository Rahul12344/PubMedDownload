Marine invertebrates associate with diverse microorganisms. Microorganisms even
inhabit coelomic fluid (CF), namely, the fluid filling the main body cavity of
echinoderms. The CF microbiota potentially impacts host health and disease. Here,
we analysed the CF microbiota in two common coastal starfish species, Patiria
pectinifera and Asterias amurensis. Although microbial community structures were 
highly variable among individual starfish, those of P. pectinifera were
compositionally similar to those in the surrounding seawater. By contrast, many
A. amurensis individuals harboured unique microbes in the CF, which was dominated
by the unclassified Thiotrichales or previously unknown Helicobacter-related
taxon. In some individuals, the Helicobacter-related taxon was the most abundant 
genus-level taxon, accounting for up to 97.3% of reads obtained from the CF
microbial community. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a
Helicobacter-related-taxon-specific probe suggested that probe-reactive cells in 
A. amurensis were spiral-shaped, morphologically similar to known Helicobacter
species. Electron microscopy revealed that the spiral cells had a
prosthecate-like polar appendage that has never been reported in Helicobacter
species. Although culture of Helicobacter-related taxon was unsuccessful, this is
the first report of the dominance of a Helicobacter-related taxon in
invertebrates and non-digestive organs, reshaping our knowledge of the
phylogeography of Helicobacter-related taxa.
