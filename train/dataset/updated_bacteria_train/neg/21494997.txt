Septic arthritis and osteitis at the hand are associated with a high morbidity.
Trauma is the major cause for these infections. In the majority of cases the
fingers are involved. Causative microorganisms are predominantly Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, an increasing number of
Gram-negative bacteria have been found in hand infections. As differential
diagnosis, tumours and non-septic arthritis must be considered. Treatment
includes surgical debridement, immobilisation and functional rehabilitation.
Crucial for the surgical strategy are the virulence of the pathogens, the
resistance of the patient and the location of the infection. If functional
recovery cannot be expected, salvage procedures like arthrodeses and resection
arthroplasties are sometimes required. Surgical treatment is sufficient in septic
arthritis and osteomyelitis of the hand. However, to avoid permanent disability, 
rapid diagnosis and therapy are essential. This review describes our treatment
concepts in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis at the hand.
