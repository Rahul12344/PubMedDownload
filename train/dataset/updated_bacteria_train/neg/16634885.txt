BACKGROUND: Streptococcal throat infections and HLA Cw6 (Cw*06) have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, particularly in the guttate form.
OBJECTIVES: To study 105 Irish patients with psoriasis to investigate the
relationship between streptococcal infections and Cw*06.
METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups: those with guttate psoriasis 
or guttate flare (guttate group, GG, n=64) and those with chronic plaque
psoriasis (chronic plaque group, CPG, n=41).
RESULTS: The incidence of Cw*06 was 86% in the GG and 73% in the CPG, which was
not significantly different (P=0.1725) but the incidence in both groups was
significantly higher than in an Irish control group (18%) (P<0.0001 vs. GG and
P<0.0001 vs. CPG). Evidence for streptococcal infection was higher in the GG
(56%) than in the CPG (32%) (P=0.0231). Of those patients with evidence of
streptococcal infection, 30 of 36 GG (83%) and nine of 13 CPG (69%) patients
possessed the Cw*06 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, not all patients with streptococcal-related psoriasis carry
Cw*06. The role of Cw*06 in psoriasis, if any, has yet to be determined.
