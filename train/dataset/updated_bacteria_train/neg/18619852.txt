We previously identified nuclear receptor binding protein 2 (NRBP2) in a screen
for genes induced by differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. Here we
show that during embryonic mouse brain development NRBP2 was expressed in the
walls of the third and fourth ventricles, and in the hippocampus. In the adult
brain, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and neurons in the CA3 region of the
hippocampus were main sites of NRBP2 expression. Analysis of a pediatric
medulloblastoma showed that clusters of NRBP2 positive tumor cells co-expressed
neurofilament, but not GFAP. Thus, NRBP2 was associated with neuronal
differentiation both in normal and malignant brain tissue. We report that NRBP2
is a 55-60 kDa protein with mainly cytoplasmic location. In vitro, NRBP2 protein 
levels increased as neural stem/progenitor cells differentiated, and its down
regulation by siRNA rendered neural progenitor cells more vulnerable to
apoptosis. NRBP2 has no previously assigned function and our studies suggest a
role for NRBP2 in neural progenitor cell survival.
