Vaccinated, feed-trained largemouth bass fry (Micropterus salmoides floridanus)
were cohabited with sham-vaccinated fish. Fish were exposed, under natural
conditions, to Flavobacterium columnare, a ubiquitous bacterium associated with
columnaris disease. During every time interval, the probability that a vaccinated
fish would survive past time, t, was greater than for sham-vaccinated fish and
survivor functions were significantly different (p-value <0.001). Overall,
vaccinated fish had a 43% lower risk of death during the field trial. Overall
incidence was 1.7 times greater for the sham-vaccinated (1.4%/d) as compared to
the vaccinated fish (0.8%/d). Vaccination with AQUAVAC-COL
(Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health) significantly reduced the risk of death 
from columnaris disease in feed-trained largemouth bass fry.
