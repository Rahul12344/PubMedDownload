A real-time PCR hybridization assay for Legionella pneumophila is described; the 
assay uses LightCycler (Idaho Technology) methodology to specifically detect 2.5 
CFU/reaction, equivalent to 1,000 CFU/liter of starting water sample. The assay, 
including DNA extraction and confirmation of product identity, is completed
within 90 min of receipt of a sample.
