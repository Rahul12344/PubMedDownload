Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) are encoded non-ribosomally by
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and possess diverse biological activities. In
this study, we conducted chemical structure and BGC analyses with antimicrobial
activity assays for two CLPs produced by Pseudomonas strains isolated from the
cocoyam rhizosphere in Cameroon and Nigeria. LC-MS and NMR analyses showed that
the Pseudomonas sp. COR52 and A2W4.9 produce pseudodesmin and viscosinamide,
respectively. These CLPs belong to the Viscosin group characterized by a
nonapeptidic moiety with a 7-membered macrocycle. Similar to other Viscosin-group
CLPs, the initiatory non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene of the
viscosinamide BGC is situated remotely from the other two NRPS genes. In
contrast, the pseudodesmin genes are all clustered in a single genomic locus.
Nano- to micromolar levels of pseudodesmin and viscosinamide led to the hyphal
distortion and/or disintegration of Rhizoctonia solani AG2-2 and Pythium
myriotylum CMR1, whereas similar levels of White Line-Inducing Principle (WLIP), 
another member of the Viscosin group, resulted in complete lysis of both
soil-borne phytopathogens. In addition to the identification of the biosynthetic 
genes of these two CLPs and the demonstration of their interaction with
soil-borne pathogens, this study provides further insights regarding evolutionary
divergence within the Viscosin group.
