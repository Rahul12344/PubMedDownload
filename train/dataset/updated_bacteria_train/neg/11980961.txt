A molecular typing approach for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli was
developed with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a 9.6-kb
PCR-amplified portion of the lipopolysaccharide gene cluster. Sixty-one Penner
serotype reference strains were analyzed with this new genotyping scheme, and 32 
genogroups were found. Eleven additional genogroups were obtained from 87
clinical C. jejuni strains tested. This molecular typing method shows a
correlation with the Penner heat-stable serotyping method, a phenotypic typing
method based on lipopolysaccharide structures that is often used as a "gold
standard" for subtyping Campylobacter spp. This strong correlation suggests that 
the data obtained can be directly compared with epidemiological data collected in
the past by classical serotyping of C. jejuni and C. coli. In contrast to the
high percentage of nontypeability by phenotyping, this molecular typing method
results in 100% typeability and provides a superior alternative to serotyping.
