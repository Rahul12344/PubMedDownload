Postoperative pneumonia. Determinants of mortality.

Martin LF, Asher EF, Casey JM, Fry DE.

Postoperative pneumonia continues to be a major cause of mortality on surgical
services. The determinants that affect survival in patients in whom postoperative
pneumonia develops are not clearly defined. We completed a retrospective analysis
of 136 patients in whom postoperative pneumonia developed after they had major
operative procedures between 1974 and 1980. These patients represented 1.3% of
all operative cases, yet comprised 10% of the total 614 patients who died during 
the study period. The average age of the patients in whom pneumonia developed was
66 years. Significant determinants of death by chi 2 analysis included
gram-negative pneumonitis, emergent operation, respirator-acquired pneumonia,
postoperative peritonitis, and several factors that suggested that host defenses 
were overwhelmed (remote organ failure, positive blood cultures, or spread of
infection to the second lung). We concluded that postoperative pneumonia is a
disease of elderly patients and that survival depends on the ability of the
surgeon to help the patient localize and resist the challenge presented by
virulent gram-negative organisms.
