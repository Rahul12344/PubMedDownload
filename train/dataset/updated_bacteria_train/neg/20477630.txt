Autoimmune diseases are caused by pathogenic antibody and/or T-cell responses
that are left unchecked by regulatory immune mechanisms. Recent studies in
immunology have focused on subsets of regulatory T cells (T(regs)) that can
suppress autoimmune responses. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a
subset of T(regs) that recognize glycolipid antigens in the context of CD1d
proteins. iNKT cells play a suppressive role in several autoimmune diseases and, 
therefore, are attractive targets for development of immunotherapies for these
diseases. While preclinical studies with reagents, such as the sea sponge-derived
iNKT-cell antigen alpha-galactosylceramide, have been promising, there are
substantial concerns about treating humans with autoimmunity, or at risk of
developing autoimmunity, with these reagents.
