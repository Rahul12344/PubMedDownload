We cloned and sequenced the rpoD1 gene of Microcystis aeruginosa K-81, a
unicellular colony-forming cyanobacterium that can perform photosynthesis
involving light-responsive gene expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of
RpoD1 exhibited extensive homology to the other eubacterial principal sigma
factors. Primer extension and Western blot analyses revealed that the rpoD1 gene,
which encodes a principle sigma factor homolog, had two transcription start
points, P1 and P2. These transcripts, and the corresponding protein,
constitutively appeared in M. aeruginosa, irrespective of light or dark
conditions.
