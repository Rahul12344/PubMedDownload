Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences from deep marine sediments
identified a deeply branching clade, designated candidate division JS1. Primers
for PCR amplification of partial 16S rRNA genes that target the JS1 division were
developed and used to detect JS1 sequences in DNA extracted from various
sedimentary environments, including, for the first time, coastal marine and
brackish sediments.
