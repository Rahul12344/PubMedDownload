OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether vaginal
preparation with povidone iodine before cesarean delivery decreased the risk of
postoperative maternal morbidities.
STUDY DESIGN: The design of the study was a randomized, controlled trial in women
undergoing cesarean delivery with subjects assigned to have a preoperative
vaginal cleansing with povidone iodine or to a standard care group (no vaginal
wash). The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative fever, endometritis, 
sepsis, readmission, wound infection, or complication.
RESULTS: There were 155 vaginal cleansing subjects and 145 control subjects.
Overall, 9.0% developed the composite outcome, with fewer women in the cleansing 
group (6.5%) compared with the control group (11.7%), although the difference was
not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval,
0.26-1.11; P = .11). Length of surgery, being in labor, and having a dilated
cervix were all associated with the composite morbidity outcome.
CONCLUSION: Vaginal cleansing with povidone iodine before cesarean delivery may
decrease postoperative morbidities, although the reduction is not statistically
significant.
