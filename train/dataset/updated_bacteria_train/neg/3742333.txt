Temporary low oxygen conditions for the formation of nitrate reductase and
nitrous oxide reductase by denitrifying Pseudomonas sp. G59.

Aida T, Hata S, Kusunoki H.

Formation of nitrate reductase (NaR) and nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR) by a
Pseudomonas sp. G59 did not occur in aerobic or anaerobic conditions, but was
observed in a microaerobic incubation in which an anaerobically grown culture was
agitated in a sealed vessel initially containing 20 kPa oxygen in the headspace. 
During the microaerobic incubation, the oxygen concentration in the headspace
decreased and dissolved oxygen reached 0.1-0.2 kPa. NaR activity was detected
immediately and N2OR activity after 3 h of incubation irrespective of the
presence or absence of NO3- or N2O. In the presence of NO3-, NO2- was accumulated
as a major product, but N2O was observed in low concentrations only after N2OR
appeared. After microaerobic incubation for 3 h, N2OR formation continued even
anaerobically in an atmosphere of N2O. In contrast, Escherichia coli formed NaR
not only microaerobically but also anaerobically. However, NaR formation by E.
coli was inhibited by sodium fluoride under anaerobic, but not under microaerobic
conditions. The Pseudomonas culture did not possess fermentative activity. It is 
suggested that the dependence on microaerobiosis for the formation of these
reductases by the Pseudomonas culture was due to an inability to produce energy
anaerobically until these anaerobic respiratory enzymes were formed.
