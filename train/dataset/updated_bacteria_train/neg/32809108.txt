The aim of this mini-review with own results was an identification of techniques 
to suppress the growth of microbial contaminants under photo- and mixotrophic
conditions. Techniques identified are the modification of environmental
conditions, such as pH, oxygen, and nutrient concentrations, as well as the
application of pulsed electric field, ultrasonication, and surfactants. In
phototrophic cultivations, the mentioned techniques result in a decrease of
number of predatory cells, but not in a complete removal. Measures to suppress
the growth of contaminations (e.g., bacteria and fungi) in mixotrophic
cultivations could not be identified. The co-cultivation of algae and fungi,
however, was found to be beneficial for the utilization of unusual carbon
compounds (e.g., phenolic compounds).
