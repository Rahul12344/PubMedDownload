Release of outer membrane vesicles is a common feature of Gram negative bacteria.
There is growing interest in the use of these vesicles in the development of
affordable vaccines. However, to exploit their full potential a convenient system
to generate recombinant vesicles would be highly desirable. Here, we report the
design of a versatile system for preparation of recombinant outer membrane
vesicles based on an engineered autotransporter. Two model vaccine antigens of
Leishmania were expressed as fusion proteins with the transporter domain of AIDA,
the Escherichia coli adhesin involved in diffuse adhesion. Single subcutaneous
injections of recombinant vesicles boosted vaccine antigen-specific antibody
responses in mice primed with live recombinant salmonella vaccines by 6-40-fold. 
The results further show an expansion of only the vaccine antigen-specific
antibody response indicating a great potential of this approach for prime boost
vaccination strategies.
