Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) and TWIST1 are transcription factors
necessary for craniofacial development. Human genetic studies showed that
mutations in IRF6 lead to cleft lip and palate and mandibular abnormalities. In
the mouse, we found that loss of Irf6 causes craniosynostosis and mandibular
hypoplasia. Similarly, mutations in TWIST1 cause craniosynostosis, mandibular
hypoplasia and cleft palate. Based on this phenotypic overlap, we asked if Irf6
and Twist1 interact genetically during craniofacial formation. While single
heterozygous mice are normal, double heterozygous embryos (Irf6 +/- ; Twist1 +/- 
) can have severe mandibular hypoplasia that leads to agnathia and cleft palate
at birth. Analysis of spatiotemporal expression showed that Irf6 and Twist1 are
found in different cell types. Consistent with the intercellular interaction, we 
found reduced expression of Endothelin1 (EDN1) in mandible and transcription
factors that are critical for mandibular patterning including DLX5, DLX6 and
HAND2, were also reduced in mesenchymal cells. Treatment of mandibular explants
with exogenous EDN1 peptides partially rescued abnormalities in Meckel's
cartilage. In addition, partial rescue was observed when double heterozygous
embryos also carried a null allele of p53. Considering that variants in IRF6 and 
TWIST1 contribute to human craniofacial defects, this gene-gene interaction may
have implications on craniofacial disorders.
