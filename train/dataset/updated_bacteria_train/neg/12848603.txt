The mucormycosis is an opportunistic mycosis which has a high rate of global
mortality with a bad prognosis. The present clinical case shows a patient
attended in the Intensive Care Unit because of a breathing insufficiency
secondary to a pneumonia. Among his antecedents there is a larynx carcinoma
totally remittent after chemo- and radiotherapy. He develops an infrapalpebral
injury which spreads rapidly in a bilateral way acquiring a necrotic look that it
did not have initially. Having that evolution, it is implemented a treatment with
liposomal amphotericin B and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors after an
injury biopsy, whose posterior cultive shows growing of Mucor. This kind of
pathology must be initially suspected in all the patients with a neoplasia and
its treatment must be early and agressive. At the moment the diagnosis is
suspected there is a great tissue destruction and for that reason the patients
usually die in spite of the instauration of aggressive therapies
