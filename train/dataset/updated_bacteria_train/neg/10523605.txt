We have purified soluble mouse and human CD1d molecules to assess the structural 
requirements for lipid antigen presentation by CD1. Plate-bound CD1d molecules
from either species can present the glycolipid alpha-galactosyl ceramide
(alpha-GalCer) to mouse natural killer T cells, formally demonstrating both the
in vitro formation of antigenic complexes, and the presentation of alpha-GalCer
by these two CD1d molecules. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that at
neutral pH, mouse CD1 and human CD1d bind to immobilized alpha-GalCer, unlike
human CD1b, which requires acidic pH for lipid antigen binding. The CD1d
molecules can also bind both to the nonantigenic beta-GalCer and to
phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that diverse lipids can bind to CD1d. These 
studies provide the first quantitative analysis of monomeric lipid antigen-CD1
interactions, and they demonstrate that the orientation of the galactose, or even
the nature of the polar head group, are likely to be more important for T cell
receptor contact than CD1d binding.
