Flavobacterium psychrophilum is one of the most important pathogens affecting
cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Recent information from UK salmonid
farms showed country-wide distribution of genetically and serologically divergent
clones, which has hampered the development of a vaccine for rainbow trout fry
syndrome. The current study assessed the efficacy of an injectable polyvalent
vaccine containing formalin-inactivated F. psychrophilum in rainbow trout. The
vaccine was formulated with an oil adjuvant (Montanide ISA 760VG) or
formalin-killed cells alone. Duplicate groups of trout (60 ± 13 g) were given
phosphate-buffered saline or vaccine formulated with Montanide by
intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection and challenged by intra-muscular (i.m.)
injection with a homologous and a heterologous isolate of F. psychrophilum at 525
degree days post-vaccination (dd pv). Significant protection was achieved in
vaccinated fish (p = 0.0001, RPS 76% homologous, 88% heterologous). Efficacy of
the adjuvanted vaccine was also demonstrated by heterologous challenge at 1155 dd
pv resulting in 100% protection, whereas survival in the un-adjuvanted group was 
not significantly different from control fish. Levels of specific antibody at
1155 dd pv, as measured by ELISA, were significantly higher in the fish
vaccinated with adjuvant when compared with unvaccinated fish.
