Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells express a semiinvariant αβ T cell
receptor (TCR) that binds MHC class I-like molecule (MR1). However, the molecular
basis for MAIT TCR recognition by MR1 is unknown. In this study, we present the
crystal structure of a human Vα7.2Jα33-Vβ2 MAIT TCR. Mutagenesis revealed highly 
conserved requirements for the MAIT TCR-MR1 interaction across different human
MAIT TCRs stimulated by distinct microbial sources. Individual residues within
the MAIT TCR β chain were dispensable for the interaction with MR1, whereas the
invariant MAIT TCR α chain controlled specificity through a small number of
residues, which are conserved across species and located within the Vα-Jα
regions. Mutagenesis of MR1 showed that only two residues, which were centrally
positioned and on opposing sides of the antigen-binding cleft of MR1, were
essential for MAIT cell activation. The mutagenesis data are consistent with a
centrally located MAIT TCR-MR1 docking that was dominated by the α chain of the
MAIT TCR. This candidate docking mode contrasts with that of the NKT
TCR-CD1d-antigen interaction, in which both the α and β chain of the NKT TCR is
required for ligation above the F'-pocket of CD1d.
