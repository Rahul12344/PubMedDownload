CONTEXT: Presence/absence tests for alkaloids of 31 medicinal vascular plant
species from 31 genera and 26 families of eastern Nicaragua provided a baseline
for bioactivity tests.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the bioactivity and cytoxicity of aqueous extracts of
widely used medicinal species in eastern Nicaragua.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethnomedicinal applications were obtained from interviews 
of traditional healers. We used Dragendorff's reagent to test alkaloids and brine
shrimp for cytotoxicity of aqueous extracts.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine of the 31 species tested positive for alkaloids. The median 
lethal concentration that kills 50% of the larvae within 24 h of contact with the
extract (LC(50) was less than 1000 µg/mL for 4 (13%) species (the usual cytotoxic
category), 1001-5000 µg/mL for 23 (74%) species, and between 5001-7500 µg/mL for 
the remaining 4 (13%) species.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Twenty-five of the ethnomedicines contain alkaloids
but are not cytotoxic. In contrast to first suppositions, we suggest that this is
a good and desirable, and perhaps expected, outcome. Medicinal plants that are
cytotoxic may obviously control or kill bacteria or other pathogens, but may also
negatively affect the patient; some high alkaloid levels have been associated
with carcinogens. Thus, perhaps the majority of effective medicinals should be
expected to be noncytotoxic. We suggest that this is a new paradigm for
consideration of the overall value and effectiveness of medicinals. Of course,
medicinals also can be effective in numerous ways (e.g., organ stimulation or
other physiological functions) other than simply as antimicrobials or
antipathogens.
