Pathogenic mycobacteria infect macrophages where they replicate in phagosomes
that minimize contact with late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Loading of Ags 
to MHC class II molecules occurs in specialized compartments with late endosomal 
characteristics. This points to a sequestration of mycobacteria-containing
phagosomes from the sites where Ags meet MHC class II molecules. Indeed, in
resting macrophages MHC class II levels decreased strongly in phagosomes
containing M. avium during a 4-day infection. Phagosomal MHC class II of early (4
h) infections was partly surface-derived and associated with peptide. Activation 
of host macrophages led to the appearance of H2-M, a chaperon of Ag loading, and 
to a strong increase in MHC class II molecules in phagosomes of acute (1 day)
infections. Comparison with the kinetics of MHC class II acquisition by
IgG-coated bead-containing phagosomes suggests that the arrest in phagosome
maturation by mycobacteria limits the intersection of mycobacteria-containing
phagosomes with the intracellular trafficking pathways of Ag-presenting
molecules.
