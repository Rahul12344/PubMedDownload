The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile secretion machine dedicated to
various functions in Gram-negative bacteria, including virulence toward
eukaryotic cells and antibacterial activity. Activity of T6SS might be followed
in vitro by the release of two proteins, Hcp and VgrG, in the culture
supernatant. Citrobacter rodentium, a rodent pathogen, harbors two T6SS gene
clusters, cts1 and cts2. Reporter fusion and Hcp release assays suggested that
the CTS1 T6SS was not produced or not active. The cts1 locus is composed of two
divergent operons. We therefore developed a new vector allowing us to swap the
two divergent endogenous promoters by P(tac) and P(BAD) using the λ red
recombination technology. Artificial induction of both promoters demonstrated
that the CTS1 T6SS is functional as shown by the Hcp release assay and confers on
C. rodentium a growth advantage in antibacterial competition experiments with
Escherichia coli.
