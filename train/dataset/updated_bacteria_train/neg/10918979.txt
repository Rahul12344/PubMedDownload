A rickettsia-like organism isolated from infected, farm-reared Cherax
quadricarinatus was cultured in the yolk sac of developing chicken eggs, but
could not be cultured in 3 continuous cell lines, bluegill fry (BF-2), fathead
minnow (FHM), and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9). The organism was confirmed by
fulfilling Koch's postulates as the aetiological agent of mortalities amongst C. 
quadricarinatus. When C. quadricarinatus was inoculated with the organism,
mortality was 100% at 28 degrees C and 80% at an ambient temperature of 24
degrees C. Horizontal transmission with food and via the waterborne route was
demonstrated, but mortalities were lower at 30 and 10% respectively over a 4 wk
period. The 16S rRNA sequence of 1325 base pairs of the Gram-negative, obligate
intracellular organism was 95.6% homologous to Coxiella burnetii. Of 18 species
compared to this rickettsia, the next most closely related bacterium was
Legionella pneumophila at 86.7%. The suggested classification of this organism is
Order Rickettsiales, family Rickettsiaceae, tribe Rickettsieae, within the genus 
Coxiella. We suggest it should be named Coxiella cheraxi sp. nov.
