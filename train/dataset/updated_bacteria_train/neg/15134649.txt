UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine ligase (MurC) is an essential bacterial enzyme
involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and a target for the discovery of novel
antibacterial agents. As a result of a high-throughput screen (HTS) against a
chemical library for inhibitors of MurC, a series of benzofuran acyl-sulfonamides
was identified as potential leads. One of these compounds, Compound A, inhibited 
Escherichia coli MurC with an IC(50) of 2.3 microM. Compound A exhibited
time-dependent, partially reversible inhibition of E. coli MurC. Kinetic studies 
revealed a mode of inhibition consistent with the compound acting competitively
with the MurC substrates ATP and UDP-N-acetyl-muramic acid (UNAM) with a K(i) of 
4.5 microM against ATP and 6.3 microM against UNAM. Fluorescence binding
experiments yielded a K(d) of 3.1 microM for the compound binding to MurC.
Compound A also exhibited high-affinity binding to bovine serum albumin (BSA) as 
evidenced by a severe reduction in MurC inhibition upon addition of BSA. This
finding is consistent with the high lipophilicity of the compound. Advancement of
this compound series for further drug development will require reduction of
albumin binding.
