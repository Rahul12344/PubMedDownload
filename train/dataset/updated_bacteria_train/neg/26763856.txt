BACKGROUND: Propionibacterium acnes (P acnes) has been linked to chronic
infections in shoulder surgery. It was recently observed during first-time
shoulder surgery in healthy patients at a rate between 36% and 56%. Male gender
and the anterolateral approach were reported risk factors. Because the skin
biology greatly differs, we aimed to correlate skin complaints with P
acnes-positive intraoperative cultures from different tissue layer samples in
patients undergoing shoulder surgery for the first time.
METHODS: Intraoperative samples (1 skin, 1 superficial, 1 deep tissue, and 1
control sample) from 112 patients (70 men, 42 women; aged 59.2 years) were
cultured. The association between the presence of P acnes in the deep or
superficial tissue, or both, and 10 items of a validated preoperative
questionnaire for skin pathology was explored.
RESULTS: The cultures were positive for P acnes in 38.4% (n = 43) of the cases.
Skin samples were positive for P acnes in 8% (n = 9), superficial samples were
positive in 23% (n = 26), and deep samples were positive in 30% (n = 34).
Self-reported "loss of hair" was significantly negatively associated with the
presence of P acnes in the superficial or deep tissue sample (P = .00028).
DISCUSSION: Patients who report having "loss of hair" show fewer P acnes-positive
cultures in intraoperative tissue samples taken during open shoulder surgery.
Whether this subgroup is at a lesser risk for P acnes infections remains to be
substantiated.
