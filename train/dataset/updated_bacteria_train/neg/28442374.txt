INTRODUCTION: Deep neck infections are defined as suppurative infectious
processes of deep visceral spaces of the neck.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review different factors that may
influence peritonsillar and deep neck infections and may play a role as bad
prognosis predictors.
METHODS: We present a retrospective study of 330 patients with deep neck
infections and peritonsillar infections who were admitted between January 2005
and December 2015 in a tertiary referral hospital. Statistical analysis of
comorbidities, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects was performed with Excel and
SPSS.
RESULTS: There has been an increase in incidence of peritonsilar and deep neck
infections. Systemic comorbidities such as diabetes or hepatopathy are bad
prognosis factors. The most common pathogen was S. viridans (32.1% of positive
cultures). 100% of the patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids, 74.24% 
needed surgical treatment. The most common complications were mediastinitis
(1.2%) and airway obstruction (0.9%).
CONCLUSION: Systemic comorbidities are bad prognosis predictors. Nowadays
mortality has decreased thanks to multidisciplinary attention and improvements in
diagnosis and treatment.
