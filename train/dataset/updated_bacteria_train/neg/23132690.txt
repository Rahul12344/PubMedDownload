Helicobacter pylori remains a controversial organism with regards to humans, with
its epidemiology still being unclear nearly two decades after its discovery. The 
association between H. pylori infection and subsequent development of chronic
active gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cell carcinoma, and B cell
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma has been well established.
Current studies, however, suggest that fewer than 20Â % of all infected patients
will develop any consequences from their infection. Hence, should the infection
be considered a disease not at all or, on the contrary, is the microorganism
harmful in only some circumstances? This article attempts to weigh the currently 
available evidence supporting that H. pylori may be good and not always bad.
