Natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate lymphocytes that share receptor
structures and functions with conventional T cells and natural killer cells. NKT 
cells are specific for glycolipid antigens bound by the major histocompatibility 
complex class I-like protein CD1d. One striking property of NKT cells is their
capacity to rapidly produce large amounts of cytokines in response to T-cell
receptor engagement, suggesting that activated NKT cells can modulate adaptive
immune responses. Recent pre-clinical studies have revealed significant efficacy 
of NKT-cell ligands such as the glycolipid alpha-galactosylceramide for treatment
of metastatic cancers and infections, and for prevention of autoimmune diseases. 
These findings suggest that appropriate stimulation of NKT cells could be
exploited for prevention or treatment of human diseases.
