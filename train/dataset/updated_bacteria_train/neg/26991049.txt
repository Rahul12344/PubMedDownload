Interleukin (IL)-33, a newly recognized member of IL-1 family of cytokines, plays
an important role in polarizing Th2-associated immunity. Recently growing
evidence indicates that IL-33 also represents a crucial mediator of antimicrobial
infection. In this study, we investigated the effect of IL-33 on antibacterial
response using an acute Staphylococcus aureus peritoneal infection model. Our
results showed that IL-33 administration induced a rapid bacterial clearance and 
markedly reduced the S. aureus infection-related mortality. IL-33-treated mice
displayed increased neutrophil influx into the focus of infection and higher
concentrations of chemokine CXCL2 in the peritoneum than untreated mice. The
beneficial effect of IL-33 priming was related to reversal of the S.
aureus-induced reduction of CXCR2 expression on the surface of neutrophils.
Furthermore, conditioning of neutrophils by IL-33 led to the enhancement of
complement receptor 3 expression induced by S. aureus, which in turn facilitates 
the phagocytosis of opsonized S. aureus. Finally, neutrophils primed by IL-33
upregulated the production of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent killing 
activity for S. aureus. All together, these findings suggest that IL-33, through 
regulating multiple steps of neutrophil-mediated bactericidal function, provides 
a profound effect in host antimicrobial defense response.
