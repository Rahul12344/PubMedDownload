Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease (JD), a 
chronic granulomatous intestinal inflammation of ruminants. Current diagnostic
tools lack sensitivity to detect JD early in infection; therefore, alternatives
are desired. The objective was to identify potential biomarkers in whole blood of
high- and low-dose (LD) MAP-challenged Holstein-Friesian calves 3 months after
inoculation. Infected calves were designated MAP-positive using the IFN-γ release
assay. Differential expression of transcripts in whole blood was compared between
non-infected controls and HD, as well as LD calves, using the Affymetrix(®)
GeneChip(®) Bovine Genome Array. Microarray data were analyzed using RMA and
PLIER algorithms; 296 transcripts were differentially expressed (17 had ≥ 1.5
fold change). The HD and LD calves had differential gene expression profiles for 
up to 80% of differentially expressed genes. Pathway analyses using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA(®)) indicated inhibition of several defence mechanisms,
including apoptosis, leukocyte and lymphocyte trafficking, overall repression of 
gene expression and potentially hydrogen peroxide production in macrophages.
Further validation using qPCR verified increased expression of CD46, ICOS, and
CEP350, but decreased expression of CTLA4, YARS, and PARVB in infected calves.
Additionally, a comparison of seropositive and seronegative infected calves
identified transcripts predictive of seroconversion. We concluded that
IL6ST/gp130 and CD22 may have important roles in the induction of antibodies
against MAP. Putative biomarkers of early MAP infection with roles in immune
responses were identified; in addition, the importance of infective dose on
biomarkers was determined.
