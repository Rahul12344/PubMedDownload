Studies were conducted to identify the bacteria responsible for spoilage of fresh
broiler chicken carcasses and to characterize the off-odors these bacteria
produce. Broiler carcasses were collected from processing plants in the northeast
Georgia area, the southeastern U.S., Arkansas, California, and North Carolina.
The carcasses were allowed to spoil under controlled conditions at 3 C and
spoilage bacteria were isolated. Each spoilage bacterium was separately
inoculated into a sterile chicken skin medium, incubated at 25 C for 48 h, and
subjectively evaluated for odor. The bacteria isolated from spoiled carcasses
that consistently produced off-odors in the chicken skin medium, regardless of
the geographical location from which the chickens were obtained, were Shewanella 
putrefaciens A, B, and D, Pseudomonas fluorescens A, B, and D, and Pseudomonas
fragi. These bacteria produced off-odors that resembled "sulfur", "dishrag",
"ammonia", "wet dog", "skunk", "dirty socks", "rancid fish", "unspecified bad
odor", or a sweet smell resembling "canned corn". Odors produced by the spoilage 
bacteria were varied; however, odors most associated with spoiled poultry, such
as "dishraggy" odors, were produced by the bacteria that were most consistently
isolated, such as S. putrefaciens and the pseudomonads.
