proximal promoters and enhancers.

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which genetic variants, such as single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), identified in genome-wide association studies act to
influence body mass remain unknown for most of these SNPs, which continue to
puzzle the scientific community. Recent evidence points to the epigenetic and
chromatin states of the genome as having important roles.
METHODS: We genotyped 355 healthy young individuals for 52 known
obesity-associated SNPs and obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using 
the Illumina 450 K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at
proximal cytosine residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age,
sex, weight category, and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in 
other tissues, we used two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n = 62; four
brain regions, n = 121-133) and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and
visceral fat (n = 149).
RESULTS: We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate
with methylation levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are
located in gene promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity
(MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1, NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1,
RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5, SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC,
ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1, SH2B1,
ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly, the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some
of these genes. We also found that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, our results indicate that some of
these associations are not blood-specific as we successfully replicated four
associations in skin fibroblasts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are
associated with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of
obesity risk allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation. This study
highlights the importance of DNA methylation and other chromatin marks as a way
to understand the molecular basis of genetic variants associated with human
diseases and traits.
