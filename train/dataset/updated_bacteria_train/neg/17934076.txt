SUMMARY: Bacteroides species are significant clinical pathogens and are found in 
most anaerobic infections, with an associated mortality of more than 19%. The
bacteria maintain a complex and generally beneficial relationship with the host
when retained in the gut, but when they escape this environment they can cause
significant pathology, including bacteremia and abscess formation in multiple
body sites. Genomic and proteomic analyses have vastly added to our understanding
of the manner in which Bacteroides species adapt to, and thrive in, the human
gut. A few examples are (i) complex systems to sense and adapt to nutrient
availability, (ii) multiple pump systems to expel toxic substances, and (iii) the
ability to influence the host immune system so that it controls other (competing)
pathogens. B. fragilis, which accounts for only 0.5% of the human colonic flora, 
is the most commonly isolated anaerobic pathogen due, in part, to its potent
virulence factors. Species of the genus Bacteroides have the most antibiotic
resistance mechanisms and the highest resistance rates of all anaerobic
pathogens. Clinically, Bacteroides species have exhibited increasing resistance
to many antibiotics, including cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole,
carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and
moxifloxacin).
