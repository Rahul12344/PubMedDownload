Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a T cell subpopulation that were named
originally based on coexpression of receptors found on natural killer (NK) cells,
cells of the innate immune system, and by T lymphocytes. The maturation and
activation of NKT cells requires presentation of glycolipid antigens by CD1d, a
cell surface protein distantly related to the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-encoded antigen presenting molecules. This specificity distinguishes NKT
cells from most CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that recognize peptides presented by
MHC class I and class II molecules. The rapid secretion of a large amount of both
Th1 and Th2 cytokines by activated NKT cells endows them with the ability to play
a vital role in the host immune defense against various microbial infections. In 
this review, we summarize progress on identifying the sources of microbe-derived 
glycolipid antigens recognized by NKT cells and the biochemical basis for their
recognition.
