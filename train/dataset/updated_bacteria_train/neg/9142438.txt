Reports on the role of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and
proline-rich sequences in actin-based motility of Listeria and potentially of
Shigella flexneri have led to the suggestion that vinculin might be an essential 
docking protein on the surface O2 motile Shigella. Therefore, whether vinculin
had a functional role in Shigella actin-based motility was tested by examining
Shigella infection of the vinculin-deficient F9 cell line variant 5.51. Shigella 
are able to form actin tails and surface protrusions in 5.51 cells that are
indistinguishable from those they produce in F9 cells, and Shigella rates of
intracellular movement and protrusion formation are similar in the two cell
lines. These data disprove the model of Shigella actin-based motility in which
vinculin is an essential docking protein for either the formation of actin tails 
or the acceleration of motile bacteria.
