Due to accumulating protein structure information and advances in computational
methodologies, it has now become possible to predict protein-compound
interactions. In biology, the classic strategy for drug discovery has been to
manually screen multiple compounds (small scale) to identify potential drug
compounds. Recent strategies have utilized computational drug discovery methods
that involve predicting target protein structures, identifying active sites, and 
finding potential inhibitor compounds at large scale. In this protocol article,
we introduce an in silico drug discovery protocol. Since multi-drug resistance of
pathogenic bacteria remains a challenging problem to address,
UDP-N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine ligase (murC) of Acinetobacter baumannii was used 
as an example, which causes nosocomial infection in hospital setups and is
responsible for high mortality worldwide. This protocol should help
microbiologists to expand their knowledge and research scope.
