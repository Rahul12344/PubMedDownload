Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of heme c and its nitrosyl derivative in 
Vibrio (Achromobacter) fischeri nitrite reductase.

Interactions of Vibrio (formerly Achromobacter) fischeri nitrite reductase were
studied by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The spectrum of the
oxidized enzyme showed a number of features which were attributed to two low-spin
ferric hemes. These comprised an unusual derivative peak at g = 3.7 and a
spectrum at g = 2.88, 2.26, and 1.51. Neither heme was reactive in the oxidized
state with the substrate nitrite and with cyanide and azide. When frozen under
turnover conditions (i.e., reduction in the presence of excess nitrite), the
enzyme showed the spectrum of a nitrosyl heme derivative. The g = 2.88, 2.26, and
1.51 signals reappeared partially on reoxidation by nitrite, indicating that the 
nitrosyl species which remained arose from the g = 3.7 heme. The nitrosyl
derivative showed a 14N nuclear hyperfine splitting, Az = 1.65 mT. The nitrosyl
derivative was produced by treatment of the oxidized nitrite reductase with
nitric oxide or hydroxylamine. Exchange of nitric oxide between the nitrosyl
derivative and NO gas in solution was observed by using the [15N]nitrosyl
compound. A possible reaction cycle for the enzyme is discussed, which involves
reduction of the enzyme followed by binding of nitrite to one heme and formation 
of the nitrosyl intermediate.
