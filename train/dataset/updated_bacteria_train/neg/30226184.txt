Vaccine Serotype 19F, England and Wales.

We observed a sudden and rapid increase in rare invasive pneumococcal disease
serotype 7C, from an annual average of 3 cases during 2000-01 through 2015-16 to 
29 cases in 2016-17. The increase was caused almost entirely by clonal expansion 
of sequence type 177, previously associated with vaccine serotype 19F.
