High cyanobacteria-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in source water can
cause drinking water quality to deteriorate, producing bad taste, odor, toxins,
and possibly elevated levels of disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors.
Conventional water treatment processes do not effectively remove algal organic
substances. In this study, rapid-sand-filtration effluent from a water treatment 
plant on Kinmen Island, where serious cyanobacterial blooms occurred, was used to
evaluate the DOC- and DBP-removal efficiency of ozonation and/or biofiltration.
To simulate a small-scale water distribution system following water treatment, 24
h simulated distribution system (SDS) tests were conducted. The following DBPs
were analyzed: trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles
(HANs), and trichloronitromethane (TCNM). Applying biological activated-carbon
filtration (BAC) on its own achieved the greatest reduction in SDS-DBPs.
Ozonation alone caused adverse effects by promoting THM, HAA, and TCNM formation.
Ozonation and BAC filtration yielded better DOC removal (51%) than BAC filtration
alone (41%). Considering the cost of ozonation, we suggest that when treating
high cyanobacterial organic matter in water destined for a small-scale water
distribution system, BAC biofiltration alone could be an efficient, economical
option for reducing DBP precursors. If DOC removal needs to be improved,
preceding ozonation could be incorporated.
