The aim of the study was to determine presence of Candida species in oral cavity 
and to investigate their relation with the smoking habit. This prospective study 
included 140 healthy respondents (75 male and 65 female) divided into two groups 
according to the age: group I (from 18 to 30 years) and group II (from 31 to 60
years). In 77 (55%) cases the respondents were smokers. Group I included 37
(52.8%) and group II 40 (57.1%) smokers. There were significantly more male
smokers, 49 (62.3%). Candida spp. were identified in 40 (29%) healthy respondents
(carriers). The most frequently isolated was Candida albicans. Patients with the 
presence of oral Candida were smokers in 33 (82.5%) cases, while patients without
Candida were smokers in 44 (44%) cases. Smoking has an influence on oral
colonization with Candida species. Both have a bad influence on oral health.
