epsilon ATP is a substrate of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and epsilon Ado is a
competitive inhibitor of ATP in the reaction of tRNA aminoacylation (Ki = 1.6
mM). The association of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase with ATP or Ado results in
synergistic binding of phenylalaninol and phenylalanine, respectively. However
neither epsilon ATP nor epsilon Ado exhibit synergism. Adenosine- and
ethenoadenosine-5'-trimethaphosphates are shown to be similar affinity reagents
of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. ATP being covalently bound to the enzyme shows
essentially lower synergistic effect in comparison with free ATP. epsilon
ATP-label is practically insensitive to the ligands namely ATP, Phe,
phenylalaninol and is highly accessible for I- ions. The scheme of behaviour of
affinity labels is assumed to be as follows: a) the formation of specific
reagent-enzyme complex, b) the covalent attachment of the reagent to the enzyme, 
c) the covalent binding induced disruption of the specific complex formed before.
