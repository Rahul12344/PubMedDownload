Buchnera aphidicola, the endosymbiont of the aphid Schizaphis graminum, contains 
the gene ftsZ, which codes for a protein involved in the initiation of septum
formation during cell division. With immunological techniques, this protein has
been detected in cell-free extracts of the endosymbiont. Nucleotide sequence
determination of a 6.4-kilobase B. aphidicola DNA fragment has indicated that, as
in E. coli, ftsZ is adjacent to genes coding for other cell division proteins as 
well as genes involved in murein synthesis (murC-ddlB-ftsA-ftsZ). Although B.
aphidicola ftsZ is expressed in E. coli, it cannot complement E. coli ftsZ
mutants. High levels of B. aphidicola FtsZ results in the formation of long
filamentous E. coli cells, suggesting that this protein interferes with cell
division. The presence of FtsZ indicates that in this, as well as in many other
previously described properties, B. aphidicola resembles free-living bacteria.
