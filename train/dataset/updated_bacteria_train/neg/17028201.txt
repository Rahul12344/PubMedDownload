Pseudomonas is one of the leading causes of contact lens-related microbial
keratitis. Despite the use of antibiotics, the host inflammatory response
continues to cause damage to the cornea, which may lead to blindness.
CXCR2-binding chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas 
keratitis, and the exact role of this receptor remains to be elucidated. Corneas 
of CXCR2 knockout and wild-type mice (Cmkar 2-/- and Cmkar 2+/+) were scratched, 
and 2x10(6) CFU/mL Pseudomonas 6294 or 6206 was added to corneas. Twenty-four
hours postinfection, mice were killed, and eyes were harvested for enumeration of
bacteria, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and inflammatory mediators. Cmkar 2-/-
had 20- to 100-fold more bacteria than Cmkar 2+/+ mice. There were no differences
in MPO levels between gene knockout and Cmkar 2+/+ mice. Histology revealed PMN
were restricted to the limbal area. Levels of CXCR2 chemokines
(keratinocyte-derived chemokine and MIP-2) were elevated significantly in gene
knockout mice. A lack of CXCR2 leads to an inability to control bacterial numbers
as a result of the inability of PMN to reach the site of infection in the
avascular cornea. These results imply that CXCR2 is critical to the extravasation
of neutrophils into the avascular cornea.
