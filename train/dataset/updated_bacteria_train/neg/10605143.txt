Fifty two bacterial strains, identified as Vibrio spp., were isolated from
diseased plaice fry. The most numerous group comprised V. anguillarum (26/52), of
which 3 isolates belonged to serogroup O2a, 16 corresponded to serogroup O18, and
7 isolates were non-typeable. All serogroup O18 isolates had identical ribotype
patterns. Fourteen isolates were identified as V. splendidus biotype I (n = 11)
or V. splendidus-like (n = 3). Seven isolates were V. fluvialis, representing the
first isolation of this species in Denmark and the first description of V.
fluvialis associated with diseased fish. All V. fluvialis isolates had identical 
ribotype patterns, indicating the presence of a single clone. The last 5 isolates
belonged to 2 different, unidentified Vibrio species (n = 2 and 3, respectively).
Although all isolates were recovered from diseased plaice fry, their exact role
as pathogens for the fry is as yet uncertain. Selected isolates were tested for
virulence to salmon and turbot. When injected into juvenile salmonid fish, the
recorded LD50 values were higher than 10(6), indicating that their virulence was 
relatively low. However, virulence seemed to deteriorate upon subculturing, and
therefore, the strains may have been more virulent upon primary isolation from
the plaice fry.
