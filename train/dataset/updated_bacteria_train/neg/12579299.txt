The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway regulates cell cycle progression 
and apoptosis in diverse types of cells. Mutations in this pathway are often
observed in transformed cell lines and frequently linked with human cancers. The 
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can induce events both associated with cell proliferation
and cell cycle arrest. The particular course chosen may depend on the strength
and the particular Raf gene activated by Ras. This pathway also is involved in
maintaining cell survival by modulating the activity of apoptotic molecules
including Bad and Bcl-2. This review will discuss the regulation of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and how it modulates cell cycle progression and cell
survival.
