Fertilized eggs collected from broodfish infected by Ovipleistophora ovariae were
tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and found to be positive
for the O. ovariae genome at 7.77 X 10(2) to 3.26 x 10(7) copies per microgram of
host DNA. Fry hatched from these eggs contained from 1.37 X 10(2) to 9.89 X 10(6)
copies of the O. ovariae genome per microgram of host DNA. Surface treatments of 
fertilized eggs with 150 mg formalin/L (used by farms as a fungicide) or a 1.5%
solution of sodium sulfite (which removes the adhesive egg matrix) did not reduce
vertical transmission to fry. Treatment of eggs with a 10% solution of bleach or 
a proprietary commercial DNA denaturant did not reduce the number of
egg-associated copies of the O. ovariae genome. Histology of ovaries of infected 
fish demonstrated spores within the oocytes. However, no spores were observed by 
histology in positive fry hatched from infected eggs. The PCR and histological
demonstration of the presence of O. ovariae spores in oocytes and fry, and the
failure of strong DNA denaturants to reduce egg-associated copies, give evidence 
that O. ovariae is vertically transmitted within eggs.
