A 7.8 kb plasmid (pQM17) encoding mercury resistance was isolated from two
epilithic strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The plasmid had a broad host
range when mobilized by RP1, transferring into Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida,
P. fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Chromobacterium sp. with
frequencies ranging from 5.3 x 10(-9) to 4.6 x 10(-4) per recipient. The plasmid 
could be transferred into A. calcoaceticus BD413 using intact cells of donor and 
recipient bacteria (i.e. natural transformation) and there was a broad
temperature optimum (14-37 degrees C) for transformation. Transformation was as
efficient in liquid matings as on plates but there was no effect of pH in the
range 5.6-7.9. Maximum transformation frequencies were obtained after 24 h on
agar plates containing 3.5-10 g C 1-1 with donor to recipient ratios ranging from
6 to 415.
