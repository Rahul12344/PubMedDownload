The new drinking water ordinance (TrinkwV 2001) entered into force in 2003. In
this paper we report about experiences with monitoring microbiological quality of
drinking water. Special problems, for instance requirements concerning the
quality of raw water, new and "old" microbiological parameters, microbiological
methods, assessment of parametric values, especially in the case of values higher
than the imperative value, are also described. Possible developments in this
field are discussed. The paper should support microbiological laboratories,
public health officers and other public authorities in monitoring and assessment 
of drinking water quality.
