The incidence of tuberculosis in Poland is about 2-3 times higher than average
for E.U. countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate tuberculosis
epidemiology in Silesia Voivodship (region where 12% of Polish citizens live)
against the background of the country (Poland). The paper presents actual TB
epidemiology situation (incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality from TB in
Silesia and in Poland) as well as its trends observed between 1994-2004. The
regional incidence in 2004 was 36% lower than in 1994, but 28 per 100,000
population is still higher than 24.9 per 100,000 observed in Poland. The
incidence of tuberculosis increases with age, 0.8 in children aged 0-14 years, up
to 48.0 among 65 and older. In 2004 incidence in the age groups 20-44 and 45-64
years (23.7 and 46.9 respectively) was much higher than average observed in
Poland (20.3 and 39.5 respectively), as well the proportion of new cases in this 
age groups. The TB incidence in men (41.7) is 2.6 times higher than in women
(15.2). Between 1998-2004 in Silesia Voivodship morbidity was growing and in 2004
was 60.6 per 100,000. In the year 2000 TB mortality was almost two times higher
in Silesia (4.4) than the average in Poland (2.4). Epidemiological situation of
tuberculosis in Silesia Voivodship between 1994-2004 improved but is still bad.
To correct this situation it is necessary to improve the process of fast
diagnosis and effective therapy.
