Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate lymphocytes whose functions
are regulated by self and foreign glycolipid antigens presented by the
antigen-presenting molecule CD1d. Activation of iNKT cells in vivo results in
rapid release of copious amounts of effector cytokines and chemokines with which 
they regulate innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens, certain types of
cancers and self-antigens. The nature of CD1d-restricted antigens, the manner in 
which they are recognised and the unique effector functions of iNKT cells suggest
an innate immunoregulatory role for this subset of T cells. Their ability to
respond fast and our ability to steer iNKT cell cytokine response to altered
lipid antigens make them an important target for vaccine design and
immunotherapies against autoimmune diseases. This review summarises our current
understanding of CD1d-restricted antigen presentation, the recognition of such
antigens by an invariant T-cell receptor on iNKT cells, and the functional
consequences of these interactions.
