We have shown previously that peripheral lymph node-resident retinoic acid
receptor-related orphan receptor γt(+) NK1.1(-) invariant NKT (iNKT) cells
produce IL-17A independently of IL-6. In this study, we show that the concomitant
presence of IL-1 and IL-23 is crucial to induce a rapid and sustained IL-17A/F
and IL-22 response by these cells that requires TCR-CD1d interaction and partly
relies on IL-23-mediated upregulation of IL-23R and IL-1R1 expression. We further
show that IL-1 and IL-23 produced by pathogen-associated molecular
pattern-stimulated dendritic cells induce this response from NK1.1(-) iNKT cells 
in vitro, involving mainly TLR2/4-signaling pathways. Finally, we found that
IL-17A production by these cells occurs very early and transiently in vivo in
response to heat-killed bacteria. Overall, our study indicates that peripheral
lymph node NK1.1(-) iNKT cells could be a source of innate Th17-related cytokines
during bacterial infections and supports the hypothesis that they are able to
provide an efficient first line of defense against bacterial invasion.
