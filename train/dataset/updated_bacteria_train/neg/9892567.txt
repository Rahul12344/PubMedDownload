One hundred and thirty-four male and 32 female patients with ankylosing
spondylitis and 33 women with pure ileitis terminalis Crohn were examined. The
study protocol included a medical-rheumatological examination and thorough
investigation for genitourinary infection. Urethroadnexitis was found in 37/134
male patients (2 patients suffered from balanitis, 17 patients from urethritis,
18 patients from prostatitis, and 2 patients from epididymitis), 15/32 female
patients (11 of them had urethritis and in 4 cases urethritis associated with
vaginitis) and 5/33 women with ileitis terminalis (every case with urethritis).
The microorganism isolated most frequently from patients with genitourinary
infection was Chlamydia trachomatis. The majority of patients with genitourinary 
infection were HLA-B27 positive. Nevertheless, the following conclusions can be
reached: (1) evidence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection is frequent in male and 
female patients with ankylosing spondylitis, (2) patients with genitourinary
infection tend to have HLA-B27, and (3) furthermore, presence of genitourinary
infection was not significantly associated with chronic illness.
