Chemokines induce rapid hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell mobilization and
synergize with hematopoietic cytokines in mobilizing stem and progenitor cells.
These proteins alone and in combination offer new paradigms for autologous and
allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The mechanisms
responsible for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization either with growth
factors or chemokines are largely unknown, but a better understanding of these
mechanisms will permit the development of novel, more rapid and efficacious
regimens. Studies presented herein indicate that the CXCR2 chemokine receptor
that interacts with selective chemokine ligands, particularly GRObeta/CXCL2 and
GRObeta-T, may be the dominant receptor mediating hematopoietic cell
mobilization, and that polymorphonuclear neutrophils may be the primary CXCR2
expressing target cell for stem and progenitor cell mobilization.
