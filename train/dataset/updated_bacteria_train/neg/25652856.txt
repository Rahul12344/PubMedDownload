OBJECTIVE: To construct the prokaryotic expression vector of human
autophagy-related protein 4 homolog B (ATG4B) labeled with His-tag, obtain the
purified His-ATG4B protein, and identify its activity preliminarily.
METHODS: ATG4B coding region was amplified from human mammary gland cDNA library 
by PCR, and was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a‚Å∫. After
verification by enzyme digestion, the correct recombinant plasmid His-ATG4B was
introduced into E.coli Rossate. The expressed recombinant plasmid was purified by
Ni-NTA beads and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The function
of the purified protein His-ATG4B was detected by GST pull-down assay.
RESULTS: The DNA fragment of about 1100 bp was successfully amplified from human 
mammary gland cDNA by PCR, and inserted into pET-28a vector correctly. The
results of double digestion and sequencing suggested that the His-ATG4B
recombinant plasmid was successfully obtained. His-ATG4B protein of about Mr 47
000 was induced and identified by SDS-PAGE analysis. GST pull-down assay showed
that His-ATG4B could interact with LC3B in vitro, suggesting that it has a good
biological function.
CONCLUSION: The prokaryotic expression protein of His-ATG4B has been obtained
successfully, which lays a foundation for further research on the function of
ATG4B in autophagy.
