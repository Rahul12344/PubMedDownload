We analyzed national foodborne outbreak data from 1973 through 2001 to determine 
the proportion of Salmonella Heidelberg outbreaks caused by specific foods. Among
6633 outbreaks with known etiology, 184 (3%) were caused by Salmonella
Heidelberg. A vehicle was identified in 101 outbreaks; at least 53 were poultry
or egg-related. Three outbreaks were attributed to egg consumption, 17 to
consumption of egg-containing foods, 25 to poultry, and 8 to foods containing
poultry and eggs. Efforts to reduce illness due to Salmonella Heidelberg
shouldensure that poultry and eggs are handled appropriately to minimize
contamination and cross contamination.
