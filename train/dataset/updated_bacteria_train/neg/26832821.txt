Plasmodium falciparum exports proteins into erythrocytes using the Plasmodium
export element (PEXEL) motif, which is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
by plasmepsin V (PMV). A recent study reported that
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) concentrated in the ER binds to PEXEL
motifs and is required for export independent of PMV, and that PEXEL motifs are
functionally interchangeable with RxLR motifs of oomycete effectors. Here we show
that the PEXEL does not bind PI(3)P, and that this lipid is not concentrated in
the ER. We find that RxLR motifs cannot mediate export in P. falciparum.
Parasites expressing a mutated version of KAHRP, with the PEXEL motif
repositioned near the signal sequence, prevented PMV cleavage. This mutant
possessed the putative PI(3)P-binding residues but is not exported. Reinstatement
of PEXEL to its original location restores processing by PMV and export. These
results challenge the PI(3)P hypothesis and provide evidence that PEXEL position 
is conserved for co-translational processing and export.
