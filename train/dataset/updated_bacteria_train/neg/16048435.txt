Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are an unusual group of T lymphocytes
that recognize glycolipid antigens presented by the major histocompatibility
complex class I-related protein CD1d. Because iNKT cells play a regulatory role
in the immune system, they are attractive targets for immunotherapy. The
marine-sponge-derived glycolipid alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) potently
activates iNKT cells. In vivo administration of alpha-GalCer to mice or humans
results in rapid and robust cytokine secretion by iNKT cells, followed by the
activation of a variety of cell types of the innate and adaptive immune systems. 
These potent immunomodulatory activities of alpha-GalCer are being exploited for 
therapeutic purposes. Preclinical studies in mice have demonstrated that
alpha-GalCer and related glycolipids can protect mice against a variety of
diseases, including cancer, infections, and several autoimmune and inflammatory
conditions. Although alpha-GalCer treatment of mice is associated with unwanted
side-effects, it has been proven safe in clinical trials with cancer patients.
These studies have raised significant enthusiasm for the development of effective
and safe iNKT-cell-based immunotherapies for a variety of human diseases.
