A schedule for treatment of cancer patients with low-dose combined chemotherapy
infusions is presented for discussion. This schedule is designed to activate the 
immune system. Active agents such as mistletoe preparations etc. which are at
present still controversial, balneological applications, diet, ethics and nursing
home facilities are mentioned. Finally the question is raised as to whether it
may be appropriate under certain circumstances in the individual case to
institute abortive cytostatic treatment even in suspicion of a cancerous
condition, i.e. at a time when the organ diagnosis has not yet been
substantiated.
