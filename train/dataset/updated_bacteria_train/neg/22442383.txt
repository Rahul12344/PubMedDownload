Exposure to microbes during early childhood is associated with protection from
immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma.
Here, we show that in germ-free (GF) mice, invariant natural killer T (iNKT)
cells accumulate in the colonic lamina propria and lung, resulting in increased
morbidity in models of IBD and allergic asthma as compared with that of specific 
pathogen-free mice. This was associated with increased intestinal and pulmonary
expression of the chemokine ligand CXCL16, which was associated with increased
mucosal iNKT cells. Colonization of neonatal-but not adult-GF mice with a
conventional microbiota protected the animals from mucosal iNKT accumulation and 
related pathology. These results indicate that age-sensitive contact with
commensal microbes is critical for establishing mucosal iNKT cell tolerance to
later environmental exposures.
