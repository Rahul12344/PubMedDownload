Stable isotopic distributions in the sulfur cycle were studied with pure and
mixed cultures of the anaerobic bacteria, Chlorobium vibrioforme and
Desulfovibrio vulgaris. D. vulgaris and C. vibrioforme can catalyze three
reactions constituting a complete anaerobic sulfur cycle: reduction of sulfate to
sulfide (D. vulgaris), oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur (C. vibrioforme),
and oxidation of sulfur to sulfate (C. vibrioforme). In all experiments, the
first and last reactions favored concentration of the light 32S isotope in
products (isotopic fractionation factor epsilon = -7.2 and -1.7%, respectively), 
whereas oxidation of sulfide favored concentration of the heavy 34S isotope in
products (epsilon = +1.7%). Experimental results and model calculations suggest
that elemental sulfur enriched in 34S versus sulfide may be a biogeochemical
marker for the presence of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in modern and ancient
environments.
