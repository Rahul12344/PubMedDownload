BACKGROUND: Infants with pertussis infection are at risk of severe clinical
illness and death. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, have
introduced maternal pertussis vaccination during pregnancy to protect infants
from infection following national increases in pertussis notifications. The
objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of maternal pertussis
vaccination in protecting infants against laboratory-confirmed pertussis
infection.
METHODS: A case-control study was undertaken in England and Wales between October
2012 and July 2013. Cases were infants aged <8 weeks at onset with pertussis
infection tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction or culture. Family
doctors of each case were asked to identify healthy infants born consecutively
after the case in each practice, to act as controls. Fifty-eight cases and 55
controls were included in this study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the
association between maternal vaccination and infant pertussis infection. The
vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 - OR. This was adjusted for sex,
geographical region, and birth period.
RESULTS: Mothers of 10 cases (17%) and 39 controls (71%) received pertussis
vaccine in pregnancy. This gave an unadjusted VE of 91% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 77%-97%). Adjusted VE was 93% (95% CI, 81%-97%).
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal pertussis vaccination is effective in preventing pertussis 
infection in infants aged <8 weeks and may be considered in other countries
experiencing high levels of pertussis notifications.
