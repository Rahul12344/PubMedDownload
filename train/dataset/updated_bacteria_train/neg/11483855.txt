Survival factors activate kinases which, in turn, phosphorylate the proapoptotic 
Bcl-xl/Bcl-2-associated death promoter homolog (BAD) protein at key serine
residues. Phosphorylated BAD interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, and overexpression
of 14-3-3 attenuates BAD-mediated apoptosis. Although BAD is known to interact
with Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL, the exact relationship between BAD and anti- or
proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins has not been analyzed systematically. Using the yeast
two-hybrid protein interaction assay, we found that BAD interacted negligibly
with proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Even though wild type BAD only interacted with 
selected numbers of antiapoptotic proteins, underphosphorylated mutant BAD
interacted with all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins tested (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL,
Bfl-1/A1, Mcl-1, Ced-9, and BHRF-1). Using nonphosphorylated recombinant BAD
expressed in bacteria, direct interactions between BAD and diverse antiapoptotic 
Bcl-2 members were also observed. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by BAD was
blocked by coexpression with Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bfl-1. Comparison of BAD orthologs
from zebrafish to human indicated the conservation of a 14-3-3 binding site and
the BH3 domain during evolution. Thus, highly conserved BAD interacts with
diverse antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members to regulate apoptosis.
