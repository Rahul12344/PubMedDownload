The staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec cannot solely explain the
multiresistance phenotype or the relatively mild virulence profile of
hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA). This
study reports that several multiresistant HA-MRSA strains differently expressed
genes that may support antibiotic resistance, modify the bacterial surface and
influence the pathogenic process. Genes encoding efflux pumps (norA, arsB, emrB) 
and the macrolide resistance gene ermA were found to be commonly expressed by
HA-MRSA strains, but not in the archetypal MRSA strain COL. At equivalent cell
density, the agr system was considerably less activated in all MRSA strains
(including COL) in comparison with a prototypic antibiotic-susceptible strain.
These results are in contrast to those observed in recent community-acquired MRSA
isolates and may partly explain how multiresistant HA-MRSA persist in the
hospital setting.
