An inducible promoter system provides a powerful tool for studying the genetic
basis for virulence. A variety of inducible systems have been used in other
organisms, including pXyl-xylR-inducible promoter, the pSpac-lacI system, and the
arabinose-inducible P(BAD) promoter, but each of these systems has limitations in
its application to Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we demonstrated the
efficacy of a tetracycline-inducible promoter system in inducing gene expression 
in S. aureus in vitro and inside epithelial cells as well as in an animal model
of infection. Using the xyl/tetO promoter::gfp(uvr) fusion carried on a shuttle
plasmid, we demonstrated that dose-dependent tetracycline induction, as measured 
by bacterial fluorescence, occurred in each of the above environments while basal
activation under noninduced conditions remained low. To ascertain how the system 
can be used to elucidate the genetic basis of a pathogenic phenotype, we cloned
the sigB gene downstream of the inducible promoter. Induction of SigB expression 
led to dose-dependent attachment of the tested strain to polystyrene microtiter
wells. Additionally, bacterial microcolony formation, an event preceding mature
biofilm formation, also increased with tetracycline induction of SigB.
