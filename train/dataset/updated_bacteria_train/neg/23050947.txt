Natural killer T (NKT) cells constitute an important subset of T cells that can
both directly and indirectly mediate antitumor immunity. However, we and others
have reported that cancer patients have a reduction in both NKT cell number and
function. NKT cells can be stimulated and expanded with Î±-GalCer and cytokines
and these expanded NKT cells retain their phenotype, remain responsive to
antigenic stimulation, and display cytotoxic function against tumor cell lines.
These data strongly favor the use of ex vivo expanded NKT cells in adoptive
immunotherapy. NKT cell based-immunotherapy has been limited by the use of
autologous antigen-presenting cells, which can vary substantially in their
quantity and quality. A standardized system that relies on artificial
antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) could produce the stimulating effects of
dendritic cell (DC) without the pitfalls of allo- or xenogeneic cells. In this
review, we discuss the progress that has been made using CD1d-based aAPC and how 
this acellular antigen presenting system can be used in the future to enhance our
understanding of NKT cell biology and to develop NKT cell-specific adoptive
immunotherapeutic strategies.
