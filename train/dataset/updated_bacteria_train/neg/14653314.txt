Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of bacterial cold water
disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome, disease entities responsible for
substantial economic losses in salmonid aquaculture. Problems associated with
epizootics include high mortality rate, increased susceptibility to other
diseases, high labour costs of treatment and the enormous expenditure on
chemotherapy. Despite the increasing significance of the disease, the
pathogenesis of F. psychrophilum infections has only been partially elucidated,
hampering the development of preventive measures to efficiently combat this
disease condition. This literature review discusses the agent and the disease it 
causes, with emphasis on the bacterium-host interactions.
