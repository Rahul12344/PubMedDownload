A putative carotenoid oxygenase from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans was purified
with a specific activity of 0.8 U/mg by His-Trap affinity chromatography. The
native enzyme was estimated to be a 52 kDa monomer. Enzyme activity for
β-apo-8'-carotenal was maximal at pH 8.0 and 45 °C, with a half life of 15.3 h,
K(m) of 21 μM, and k(cat) of 25 l/min. The enzyme exhibited cleavage activity
only for carotenoids containing one β-ionone ring and its catalytic efficiency
(k(cat)/K(m)) followed the order β-apo-8'-carotenal > β-apo-4'-carotenal >
γ-carotene. The enzyme converted these carotenoids to β-apo-13-carotenones by
cleaving their C(13)-C(14) double bonds. The oxygen atom of β-apo-13-carotenone
originated not from water but from molecular oxygen. Thus, the enzyme was an
apo-carotenoid 13,14-dioxygenase.
