Natural killer T (NKT) cells are CD1d-restricted, lipid antigen-reactive T cells 
with powerful immunoregulatory potential. The prototypic antigen for NKT cells is
a marine sponge-derived glycolipid, α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), but this is 
not normally encountered in the mammalian environment. Thus, there is great
interest in the identification of more physiological stimuli for NKT cells, and
numerous studies have shown that NKT cells are capable of responding to a range
of microbial lipid-based antigens. Two new studies expand our understanding of
environmental NKT cell stimuli, with one showing that CD1d-restricted NKT cell
antigens are present within common house dust extract (HDE), whereas the other
shows that NKT cells can respond to innate stimuli irrespective of the presence
of foreign microbial antigens. Collectively, these two investigations indicate
that NKT cells are far more likely to encounter foreign antigens, or innate
activating signals, than previously recognized, suggesting a more central role
for these cells in the immune system.
