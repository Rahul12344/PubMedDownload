Streptococcus pneumoniae contains a single Ser/Thr kinase-phosphatase pair known 
as StkP-PhpP. Here, we report the interaction of StkP-PhpP with S. pneumoniae
UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl:L-alanine ligase, MurC, an enzyme that synthesizes an
essential intermediate of the cell wall peptidoglycan pathway. Combinatorial
phage display using StkP as target selected the peptide sequence YEVCGSDTVGC as
an interacting partner and subsequently confirmed by ELISA. The phage peptide
sequence YEVCGSDTVGC aligns closely with the MurC motif spanning S. pneumoniae
amino acid coordinates 31-37. We show that MurC is phosphorylated by StkP and
that phosphoMurC is dephosphorylated by PhpP. These data suggest a link between
StkP-PhpP with the coordinated regulation of cell wall biosynthesis via MurC.
