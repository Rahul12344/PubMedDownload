Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer. Activated immune cells are intrinsically
capable of homing to inflammatory sites. Using three inflammatory-driven disease 
mouse models, we show that grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNV) coated with
inflammatory-related receptor enriched membranes of activated leukocytes (IGNVs) 
are enhanced for homing to inflammatory tumor tissues. Blocking LFA-1 or CXCR1
and CXCR2 on the IGNVs significantly inhibits IGNV homing to the inflammatory
tissue. The therapeutic potential of IGNVs was further demonstrated by enhancing 
the chemotherapeutic effect as shown by inhibition of tumor growth in two tumor
models and inhibiting the inflammatory effects of dextran sulfate sodium-induced 
mouse colitis. The fact that IGNVs are capable of homing to inflammatory tissue
and that chemokines are overexpressed in diseased human tissue provides the
rationale for using IGNVs to more directly deliver therapeutic agents to
inflammatory tumor sites and the rationale for the use of IGNVs as treatment for 
certain cancers in personalized medicine.
