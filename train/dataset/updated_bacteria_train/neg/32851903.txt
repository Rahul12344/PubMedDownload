The authors highlight, from a firsthand perspective, Bruce S. McEwen's seminal
influence on the field of stress neurobiology and beyond, and how these
investigations have yielded important insights, principles and critical questions
that continue to guide stress research today. Featured are discussion of: 1) the 
important inverted-U relationship between stress/glucocorticoids and optimal
physiological function, 2) stress adaptation and the role of adaptive stress
responses, 3) mechanisms by which the short-term stress response promotes
heightened immune function and immunity, and 4) the far reaching impact of the
theoretical framework of allostasis and allostatic load-concepts that have
created new bridges between stress physiology, biomedical sciences, health
psychology and sociology.
