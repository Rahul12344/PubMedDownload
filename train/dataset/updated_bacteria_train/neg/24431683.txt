BACKGROUND: Rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening during pregnancy is
routinely carried out in India. However, its value has been questioned due to the
absence of clearly effective intervention.
OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study evaluates the usefulness of rubella and CMV 
antibody screening during pregnancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples received from pregnant women and children
were tested for rubella- and CMV-specific IgM antibodies by capture ELISA. The
data were analyzed to determine the incidence of rubella and CMV infection during
pregnancy and in congenital infections.
RESULTS: In asymptomatic pregnant females (n = 505), rubella positivity was
3.16 % and in women with bad obstetric history (BOH) (n = 220), it was 7.72 %,
while CMV positivity was 5.9 % in both asymptomatic pregnant women and in women
with BOH. In children (n = 200), the overall positivity for rubella- and
CMV-specific IgM antibodies was 15 and 25 %, respectively. A declining trend was 
observed in the incidence of both rubella and CMV infections in pregnant women
and in women with BOH. In children, the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome 
has declined, but the incidence of CMV infection has remained almost the same in 
5 years.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of rubella has reduced over the past 5 years and can
further be prevented by providing direct protection to women and school girls
with rubella vaccines. Primary CMV infection in pregnancy is the main problem,
and due to the unavailability of efficient and safe treatment, routine antenatal 
screening for rubella and CMV should be reserved for women with obstetric
complications only.
