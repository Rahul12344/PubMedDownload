recruitment via CXCR2.

The development of experimental Lyme arthritis has been correlated with the
expression of a number of chemokines and cytokines, however, none of these have
been measured directly from the arthritic joint. We examined the temporal
expression of IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma,
TNF-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, KC, macrophage inflammatory
protein-1alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 directly from the
tibiotarsal joint in arthritis-resistant C57BL/6 (B6) and -susceptible C3H/He
(C3H) mice. Only the chemokines KC and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were
differentially expressed in joints of B6 and C3H mice and correlated with the
development of Lyme arthritis. Infection of CXCR2(-/-) mice on either genetic
background resulted in a significant decrease in the development of pathology,
although infection of CCR2(-/-) mice had little or no effect. Neutrophils in
CXCR2(-/-) mice were marginalized within blood vessels and could not enter the
joint tissue. These results suggest that chemokine-mediated recruitment of
neutrophils into the infected joint is a key requirement for the development of
experimental Lyme arthritis.
