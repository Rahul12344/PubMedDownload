OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and metabolic
phenotypes in glucose and lipid metabolism and explore the pathophysiological
mechanism of the susceptibility genes.
METHODS: Three of PCOS susceptibility locus 2p16.3 (rs13405728 of LHCGR gene),
2p21 (rs13429458, rs12478601 of THADA gene) and 9q33.3 (rs2479106, rs10818854 of 
DENNDIA gene) were selected and the metabolic phenotypes were compared between
different genotypes of SNP in PCOS patients (using dominant model).
RESULTS: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly increased in CC
genotype group than in TC + TT groups at rs12478601 of THADA gene [(2.5 ± 0.8),
(2.4 ± 0.8) mmol/L; P = 0.01]. Serum insulin level of 2 hours after 75 g glucose 
intake was significantly higher in GG+AG groups than that of AA group at
rs2479106 of DENND1A gene[(71 ± 65), (64 ± 50) mU/L; P = 0.05 ], and the
prevalence of type II diabetes in first-degree relatives of patients were also
increased [9.9% (66/666), 6.9% (52/751); P < 0.05]. No association was found
between metabolic phenotypes and genotypes of rs13429458, rs10818854, and
rs13405728.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors probably have effect on the metabolic
characteristics of PCOS. THADA gene is related to lipid metabolism, while DENND1A
gene may be involved in insulin metabolism in patients with PCOS.
