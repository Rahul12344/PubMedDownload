Treatment of mouse embryonal carcinoma (F9) cells with retinoic acid, an inducer 
of F9 cell differentiation, greatly increased the level of mRNA specific to one
of the heat-shock proteins (HSP86). Experiments including the one employing
differentiation-resistant mutant F9 cells suggested that the increase represents 
early molecular events associated with the embryonal differentiation. The
increased HSP86 mRNA declined to the original level during further incubation.
The presence of cyclic AMP, which stimulates conversion of the retinoic
acid-induced primitive endoderm cells to parietal endoderm cells, prevented the
decline. These results suggest that not only the elevation of HSP86 mRNA level
represents early molecular events in F9 cell differentiation but also that
sustaining the elevated level (by cyclic AMP) is associated with further
differentiation of the embryonal cells.
