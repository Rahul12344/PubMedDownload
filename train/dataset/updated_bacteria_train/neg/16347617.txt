In situ mating experiments were done in the River Taff, South Wales, United
Kingdom, by using a natural mercury resistance plasmid (pQM1) isolated from a
mixture of epilithic bacteria in vitro. The river temperature from March to
November was found to influence transfer frequencies strongly (6.8 x 10 to 1.5 x 
10 per recipient). A linear relationship existed between log(10) transfer
frequency and river temperature (6 to 21 degrees C), a 2.6 degrees C change in
temperature giving a 10-fold change in transfer frequency. In vitro experiments
showed that pQM1 transferred most efficiently between fluorescent pseudomonads
and that one epilithic isolate (Pseudomonas fluorescens) was an efficient donor
in situ. Experiments with a P. putida recipient showed that intact epilithic
bacterial communities could transfer mercury resistance plasmids in situ at
frequencies of up to 3.75 x 10 per recipient. Nineteen of the large
(>250-kilobase) plasmids isolated by transfer into P. putida were studied in
detail and grouped into seven types by restriction digests. Mercury resistance
and UV resistance were found to be common linked phenotypes in 19 of the 23
plasmids tested.
