Clostridium difficile is the etiologic agent of nosocomial and community-acquired
diarrhea associated with exposure to antibiotics that disrupt the normal colonic 
flora. As antibacterials currently used for primary C. difficile infections favor
recurrences, new methods able to neutralize the bacterium without affecting the
gut microbiota are badly needed. Complementary treatment with probiotic agents to
reconstitute the physiologicaL intestinal flora does not yield any consistent
benefit. In recent years, fecal transplantation has been used in the
English-speaking countries with cure rates of about 87%. Fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) holds considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent
Clostridium difficile infection, but well-designed, randomized-controlled trials 
and Long-term follow-up registries are stilt required. These are needed to
identify the right patient, efficacy and safety profile of FMT before this
approach can be widely advocated. Another aspect of bad/good parasites are the
use of helminth or helminth ova for treating autoimmune diseases, especially
those affecting the gut.
