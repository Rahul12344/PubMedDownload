Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes one of the most common bacterial 
diseases of poultry worldwide. Effective control methods are therefore desirable 
and will be facilitated by a better understanding of the host response to the
pathogen. Currently, microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in host resistance to APEC are
unknown. Here, we applied RNA sequencing to explore the changed miRNAs and
deregulated genes in the spleen of three groups of broilers: nonchallenged (NC), 
APEC-challenged with mild pathology (CM), and APEC-challenged with severe
pathology (CS). Twenty-seven differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change >1.5; P
value <0.01) were identified, including 13 miRNAs between the NC and CM, 17
between the NC and CS, and 14 between the CM and CS groups. Through functional
analysis of these miRNA targets, 12 immune-related biological processes were
found to be significantly enriched. Based on combined analyses of differentially 
expressed miRNAs and mRNAs within each of the three groups, 43 miRNA-mRNA pairs
displayed significantly negative correlations (r < -0.8). Notably, gga-miR-429
was greatly increased in the CS group compared to levels in both the CM and NC
groups. In vitro, gga-miR-429 directly repressed luciferase reporter gene
activity via binding to 3' untranslated regions of TMEFF2, NTRK2, and SHISA2.
Overexpression of gga-miR-429 in the HD11 macrophage cell line significantly
inhibited TMEFF2 and SHISA2 expression, which are involved in the
lipopolysaccharide-induced platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and Wnt
signaling pathways. In summary, we provide the first report characterizing the
miRNA changes during APEC infection, which may help to shed light on the roles of
these recently identified genetic elements in the mechanisms of host resistance
and susceptibility to APEC.
