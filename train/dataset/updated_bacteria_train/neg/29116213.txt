A conventional anaerobic baffled reactors (ABRs) treating high strength sweet
potato starch wastewater at ambient temperatures resulted in acidification and
bad performances. After modification, the acidification was remitted and COD
removal efficiencies reached 92.73% at high temperatures and were maintained at
71.19% at low temperatures. Moreover, as much as 1.014 ± 0.056 L CH4/L/d were
collected at Stage III. The q-PCR results revealed that the largest methanogen
populations emerged at Stage III as well, which was 5.29 × 108 mcrA copies per
milliliter sludge. A comparable shift in the archaeal community structure at
different stages and acetoclastic methanogens Methanosaeta predominated the
archaeal community in every compartment in Stages I (63.73%) and II (48.63%).
Finally, the net energy gains analysis at mesophilic, thermophilic, and ambient
temperature revealed that modified ABR at ambient temperature was not only
economical but also profitable and could generated 3.68 KJ energy per gram COD
removed.
