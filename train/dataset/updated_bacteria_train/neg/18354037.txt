The use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat multiple myeloma (MM) is supported by 
preclinical studies as well as several phase 2 studies, but the precise
mechanism(s) of action of ATO has not been completely elucidated. We used gene
expression profiling to determine the regulation of apoptosis-related genes by
ATO in 4 MM cell lines and then focused on Bcl-2 family genes. ATO induced
up-regulation of 3 proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (Noxa, Bmf, and Puma) and
down-regulation of 2 antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L).
Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that Noxa and Puma bind Mcl-1 to release Bak
and Bim within 6 hours of ATO addition. Bak and Bim are also released from
Bcl-X(L). Silencing of Bmf, Noxa, and Bim significantly protected cells from
ATO-induced apoptosis, while Puma silencing had no effect. Consistent with a role
for Noxa inhibition of Mcl-1, the Bad-mimetic ABT-737 synergized with ATO in the 
killing of 2 MM lines. Finally, Noxa expression was enhanced by GSH depletion and
inhibited by increasing GSH levels in the cells. Understanding the pattern of
BH3-only protein response should aid in the rational design of arsenic-containing
regimens.
