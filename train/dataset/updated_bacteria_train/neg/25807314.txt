OBJECTIVE: To describe antiviral use among older, hospitalized adults during six 
influenza seasons (2006-2012) in Davidson County, Tennessee, USA.
METHODS: Among adults â‰¥50 years old hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory
illness or non-localizing fever, we collected information on provider-initiated
influenza testing and nasal/throat swabs for influenza by RT-PCR in a research
laboratory, and calculated the proportion treated with antivirals.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1753 adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness.
Only 26% (457/1753) of enrolled patients had provider-initiated influenza
testing. Thirty-eight patients had a positive clinical laboratory test,
representing 2.2% of total patients and 8.3% of tested patients. Among the 38
subjects with clinical laboratory-confirmed influenza, 26.3% received antivirals 
compared to only 4.5% of those with negative clinical influenza tests and 0.7% of
those not tested (p<0.001). There were 125 (7.1%) patients who tested positive
for influenza in the research laboratory. Of those with research
laboratory-confirmed influenza, 0.9%, 2.7%, and 2.8% received antivirals (p=.046)
during pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic influenza seasons, respectively.
Both research laboratory-confirmed influenza (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.04
95%CI 1.26-7.35) and clinical laboratory-confirmed influenza (AOR 3.05, 95%CI
1.07-8.71) were independently associated with antiviral treatment. Severity of
disease, presence of a high-risk condition, and symptom duration were not
associated with antiviral use.
CONCLUSIONS: In urban Tennessee, antiviral use was low in patients recognized to 
have influenza by the provider as well as those unrecognized to have influenza.
The use of antivirals remained low despite recommendations to treat all
hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected influenza.
