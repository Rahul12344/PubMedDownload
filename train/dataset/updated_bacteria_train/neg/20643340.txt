The chemokine sink hypothesis pertaining to erythrocyte Duffy Antigen Receptor
for Chemokines (DARC) during inflammation has received considerable attention,
but lacks direct in vivo evidence. Here we demonstrate, using mice with a
targeted deletion in CXCL5, that CXCL5 bound erythrocyte DARC and impaired its
chemokine scavenging in blood. CXCL5 increased the plasma concentrations of CXCL1
and CXCL2 in part through inhibiting chemokine scavenging, impairing chemokine
gradients and desensitizing CXCR2, which led to decreased neutrophil influx to
the lung, increased lung bacterial burden and mortality in an Escherichia coli
pneumonia model. In contrast, CXCL5 exerted a predominant role in mediating
neutrophil influx to the lung during inflammation after LPS inhalation. Platelets
and lung resident cells were the sources of homeostatic CXCL5 in blood and
inflammatory CXCL5 in the lung respectively. This study presents a paradigm
whereby platelets and red cells alter chemokine scavenging and
neutrophil-chemokine interaction during inflammation.
