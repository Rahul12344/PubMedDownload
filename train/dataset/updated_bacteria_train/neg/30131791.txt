Edwardsiella ictaluri is a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen causing enteric
septicemia of channel catfish (ESC). Type six secretion system (T6SS) is a
sophisticated nanomachine that delivers effector proteins into eukaryotic host
cells as well as other bacteria. In the current work, we in-frame deleted the E. 
ictalurievpB gene located in the T6SS operon by allelic exchange. The safety and 
efficacy of EiΔevpB as well as Aquavac-ESC, a commercial vaccine manufactured by 
Intervet/Merck Animal Health, were evaluated in channel catfish (Ictalurus
punctatus) fingerlings and fry by immersion exposure. Our results showed that the
EiΔevpB strain was avirulent and fully protective in catfish fingerlings. The
EiΔevpB strain was also safe in catfish fry, and immersion vaccination with
EiΔevpB at doses 106 and 107 CFU/ml in water resulted in 34.24 and 80.34%
survival after wild-type immersion challenge compared to sham-vaccinated fry
(1.79% survival). Catfish fry vaccinated with EiΔevpB at doses 106, 107, and 108 
CFU/ml in water exhibited dose-dependent protection. When compared with
Aquavac-ESC, EiΔevpB provided significantly higher protection in catfish
fingerlings and fry (p < 0.05). Results indicate that the EiΔevpB strain is safe 
and can be used to protect catfish fingerlings and fry against E. ictaluri.
