In the arsenic resistance gene cluster from the large linear plasmid pHZ227, two 
novel genes, arsO (for a putative flavin-binding monooxygenase) and arsT (for a
putative thioredoxin reductase), were coactivated and cotranscribed with
arsR1-arsB and arsC, respectively. Deletion of the ars gene cluster on pHZ227 in 
Streptomyces sp. strain FR-008 resulted in sensitivity to arsenic, and
heterologous expression of the ars gene cluster in the arsenic-sensitive
Streptomyces strains conferred resistance on the new hosts. The pHZ227 ArsB
protein showed homology to the yeast arsenite transporter Acr3p. The pHZ227 ArsC 
appears to be a bacterial thioredoxin-dependent ArsC-type arsenate reductase with
four conserved cysteine thioredoxin-requiring motifs.
