Studying the cellular populations of the camel mammary glands through the
expression pattern of the CD markers and adhesion molecules is a mean to define
whether the cellular trafficking pathway is peripheral or mucosal nature. Camel
milk cells from 8 Gram-positive and 5 Gram-negative infected camels were examined
with flow cytometry using cross-reacting antibodies like, anti-CD4(+), CD8(+),
WC+1(+)γδ, CD62L, CD11a(+)/CD18, LPAM-1, CXCR2. The overall results indicated
high flow cytometry output of most of the CD makers. The statistical analysis of 
the mean percentage of the expressed CD markers has shown that CD62L, CXCR-2,
LPAM-1, CD11a/CD18, CD8(+), IL-6R and CD20(+) were expressed in significant
differences in either type of the infection. The LPAM-1 expression has provided
further support to the notion that the lymphocyte trafficking is of the mucosal
nature. The mucosal origin of cellular trafficking has important implications on 
the vaccine design and therapeutical approaches to mastitis.
