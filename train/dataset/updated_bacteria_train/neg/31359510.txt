BACKGROUND: The overexpression of metastasis-associated protein 2 (MTA2)
contributes to human tumor progression and metastasis in various tumor cells.
However, the role of MTA2 in human oral cancer progression remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTA2 expression in human oral tumor tissues and cell lines
was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Cell proliferation and
cell cycle were analyzed using MTT assay and flow cytometry. The effects of MTA2 
on oral cell migration and invasion were investigated using migration and
invasion assays. The expression of MTA2, p-cofilin-1, and MTA2-induced LC3-II
levels were measured using Western blotting and an immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Based on the human oral cancer tissue array and TCGA database, we found 
that MTA2 was increased in oral cancer tissues than in non-tumor oral tissues
(P < .01). Moreover, MTA2 is significantly associated with tumor grade (P < .01) 
and the overall survival rate of patients with grade III tumor (P < .05). MTA2
expression in oral cancer cells was markedly higher than that in normal oral
cells. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were not significantly changed in the
cells inhibited by MTA2. MTA2 knockdown can inhibit cell migration and invasion
of human oral cancer cells. Furthermore, we suggest that MTA2 inhibition enhances
p-cofilin and LC3-II expression, and the knockdown of LC3-II expression in cells 
inhibited by MTA2 had the opposite effect.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MTA2 may serve as a candidate prognostic 
biomarker and that targeting autophagy is a potential therapeutic strategy for
treating human oral cancer.
