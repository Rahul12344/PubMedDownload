Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and
adolescents. Unfortunately, chemo-resistance is a huge obstacle in the treatment 
of OS. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of OS chemo-resistance still 
remain unknown. Here we reported that the resistance to camptothecin (cpt)
therapy was driven by degradation of DDX5. DDX5 knockdown decreased cell death
and DNA damage and recovered cell proliferation in cpt treated 143B cells.
Furthermore, we found that DDX5 bound to NONO, a kind of DNA repairing protein,
and regulated NONO functions. Our data verified that cpt-induced degradation of
DDX5 following by breaking down the protein bound of NONO, which participated in 
the resistance of cpt. In the summary, according to our results, DDX5 might be a 
potential therapeutic target for improving clinical outcomes of cpt in OS.
