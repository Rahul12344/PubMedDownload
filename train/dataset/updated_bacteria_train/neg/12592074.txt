Acne is a multifactorial disease of the pilosebaceous follicle. The most
significant pathogenetic factors of acne are: abnormal ductal keratinization,
increased sebum secretion, abnormalities of the microbial flora and inflammation.
The pilosebaceous unit is an immunocompetent organ. Keratinocytes and sebocytes
may act as immune cells capable of pathogen recognition and abnormal lipid
presentation, and they might have an important role in initiating and
perpetuating the activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The
elements of the skin immune system are involved in the development of both
noninflammatory and inflammatory acne lesions.
