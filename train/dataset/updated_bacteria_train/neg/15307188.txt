Peptide presentation by MHC molecules is an essential component of the adaptive
immune response. To persist in a host, many pathogens have evolved strategies
that interfere with MHC antigen-presentation. We show that in human cells
harboring intracellular Salmonella, MHC class II cell surface expression was
substantially reduced. The effect was specific for MHC class II as expression of 
additional surface receptors remained unchanged. We investigated the underlying
mechanism and showed that class II biosynthesis and peptide loading were
unaffected by the presence of Salmonella; however, infection led to an
intracellular accumulation of mature molecules. The intracellular class II
colocalized with lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 and HLA-DM but not with
the Salmonella-containing vacuole. Using Salmonella mutants defective in
different components and effectors of the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2
type-III secretion system, we traced the effect on class II to the sifA locus.
SifA has been shown to be involved in recruiting membrane for the
Salmonella-containing vacuoles. Our data suggest an additional role for SifA in
interfering with MHC class II antigen-presentation.
