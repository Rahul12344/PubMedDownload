To boost aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) activity in a Cupriavidus necator
strain expressing a synthetic alkane pathway, the expression of two
ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase systems was tested. The genes of a native
fd/FNR-like system were identified in C. necator and expressed in a previously
engineered alka(e)ne producing strain. The improved production of alka(e)nes in
this Re2061-pMAB1 strain confirmed the activity of the native Fd/FNR system in C.
necator. Concomitantly, the expression of the heterologous system from
Synechococcus elongatus was investigated identically, leading to a second strain,
Re2061-pMAB2. In the bioreactor, the aldehyde production was strongly reduced
compared with the original alka(e)ne producer, leading to alka(e)nes production
up to 0.37 and 1.48 g/L (22 and 82 mg/gCDW ), respectively. The alka(e)ne
production yield of Re2061-pMAB2 accounted for 15% of the theoretical yield. We
report here the highest level and yield of alka(e)nes production by an engineered
bacterium to date.
