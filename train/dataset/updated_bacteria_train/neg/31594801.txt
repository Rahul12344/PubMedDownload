BACKGROUND: Changes over the last 5 years (2013-18) in the serotypes implicated
in adult pneumococcal pneumonia and the patient groups associated with
vaccine-type disease are largely unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study of adults
admitted to two large university hospitals with community-acquired pneumonia
(CAP) between September 2013 and August 2018. Pneumococcal serotypes were
identified using a novel 24-valent urinary monoclonal antibody assay and from
blood cultures. Trends in incidence rates were compared against national invasive
pneumococcal disease (IPD) data. Persons at risk of vaccine-type pneumonia
(pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)13 and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
(PPV)23) were determined from multivariate analyses.
FINDINGS: Of 2934 adults hospitalised with CAP, 1075 (36.6%) had pneumococcal
pneumonia. The annual incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia increased from 32.2 to 
48.2 per 100 000 population (2013-18), predominantly due to increases in
PCV13non7-serotype and non-vaccine type (NVT)-serotype pneumonia (annual
incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.21 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28,
respectively). Incidence trends were broadly similar to IPD data. PCV13non7
(56.9% serotype 3) and PPV23non13 (44.1% serotype 8) serotypes were identified in
349 (32.5%) and 431 (40.1%) patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, respectively.
PCV13-serotype pneumonia (dominated by serotype 3) was more likely in patients in
the UK pneumococcal vaccination clinical risk group (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.73,
95% CI 1.31 to 2.28) while PPV23-serotype pneumonia was more likely in patients
outside the clinical risk group (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.10).
INTERPRETATION: The incidence of pneumococcal CAP is increasing, predominantly
due to NVT serotypes and serotype 3. PPV23-serotype pneumonia is more likely in
adults outside currently identified clinical risk groups.
