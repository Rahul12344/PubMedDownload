The complement system is an essential component of the innate immune system that 
participates in elimination of pathogens and altered host cells and comprises an 
essential link between the innate and adaptive immune system. Soluble and
membrane-bound complement regulators protect cells and tissues from unintended
complement-mediated injury. Complement factor H is a soluble complement regulator
essential for controlling the alternative pathway in blood and on cell surfaces. 
Normal recognition of self-cell markers (i.e. polyanions) and C3b/C3d fragments
is necessary for factor H function. Inadequate recognition of host cell surfaces 
by factor H due to mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with
complement-mediated tissue damage and disease. On the other hand, unwanted
recognition of pathogens and altered self-cells (i.e. cancer) by factor H is used
as an immune evasion strategy. This review will focus on the current knowledge
related to these versatile recognition properties of factor H.
