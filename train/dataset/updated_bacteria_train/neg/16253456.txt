Human pasteurellosis is, in general, a locoregional infection due to contact with
an animal. Systemic infections are rare and endocarditis is exceptionally
described. The authors report two new cases of endocarditis due to Pasteurella
spp, they then review 29 other published cases. Pasteurella spp. endocarditis
presents as an acute form in 64% of cases and affects the aortic as often as the 
mitral valves. Contact with an animal is documented in 65% of cases. Pasteurella 
multocida is the most frequent species in this infection. The total death rate is
40% and can reach 57% of cases in case of immunodepression. The bad prognosis of 
this infection, justifies an early diagnosis and a rapid and adapted but not yet 
consensual medicosurgical treatment.
