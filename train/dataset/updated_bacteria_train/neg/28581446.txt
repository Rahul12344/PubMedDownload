Design of efficacious Treg-based therapies and establishment of clinical
tolerance in autoimmune diseases have proven to be challenging. The clinical
implementation of Treg immunotherapy has been hampered by various impediments
related to the stability and isolation procedures of Tregs as well as the
specific in vivo targets of Treg modalities. Herein, we have demonstrated that
Foxp3+ Tregs potently suppress autoimmune responses in vivo through inhibition of
the autophagic machinery in DCs in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein
4-dependent (CTLA4-dependent) manner. Autophagy-deficient DCs exhibited reduced
immunogenic potential and failed to prime autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells to
mediate autoimmunity. Mechanistically, CTLA4 binding promoted activation of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis and FoxO1 nuclear exclusion in DCs, leading to decreased
transcription of the autophagy component microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3Î² (Lc3b). Human DCs treated with CTLA4-Ig, a fusion protein composed of
the Fc region of IgG1 and the extracellular domain of CTLA4 (also known as
abatacept, marketed as Orencia), demonstrated reduced levels of autophagosome
formation, while DCs from CTLA4-Ig-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients
displayed diminished LC3B transcripts. Collectively, our data identify the
canonical autophagy pathway in DCs as a molecular target of Foxp3+ Treg-mediated 
suppression that leads to amelioration of autoimmune responses. These findings
may pave the way for the development of therapeutic protocols that exploit Tregs 
for the treatment of autoimmunity as well as diseases in which disturbed
tolerance is a common denominator.
