Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting 
multiple organs and tissues. Although there is a wide range of therapeutic
applications, the coexistence of severe side effects and contraindications
outlines the necessity of new therapeutic options in the treatment of severe RA. 
We report on the case of a 71-year-old patient with successful treatment of a
complicated RA with tryptophan immunoadsorption combined with low-dose steroids. 
Bacterial spondylitis developed in this patient during long-term treatment with
infliximab and methotrexate. Weekly immunoadsorption sessions with tryptophan
columns resulted in continuous suppression of RA activity over a period of more
than 5 months, as indicated by laboratory findings, the disease activity score,
and the visual analog scale. This is the first report of successful treatment of 
a refractory and complicated RA using tryptophan immunoadsorption columns. In
conclusion, immunoadsorption is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative,
which should be considered to bridge infectious complications in patients with
severe RA.
