Tuberculosis remains a serious threat to human health world-wide, and improved
efficiency of medical treatment requires a better understanding of the
pathogenesis and the discovery of new drugs. In the present study, we performed a
whole-cell based screen in order to complete the characterization of 168
compounds from the GlaxoSmithKline TB-set. We have established and utilized novel
previously unexplored host-model systems to characterize the GSK compounds, i.e. 
the amoeboid organisms D. discoideum and A. castellanii, as well as a microglial 
phagocytic cell line, BV2. We infected these host cells with Mycobacterium
marinum to monitor and characterize the anti-infective activity of the compounds 
with quantitative fluorescence measurements and high-content microscopy. In
summary, 88.1% of the compounds were confirmed as antibiotics against M. marinum,
11.3% and 4.8% displayed strong anti-infective activity in, respectively, the
mammalian and protozoan infection models. Additionally, in the two systems,
13-14% of the compounds displayed pro-infective activity. Our studies underline
the relevance of using evolutionarily distant pathogen and host models in order
to reveal conserved mechanisms of virulence and defence, respectively, which are 
potential "universal" targets for intervention. Subsequent mechanism of action
studies based on generation of over-expresser M. bovis BCG strains, generation of
spontaneous resistant mutants and whole genome sequencing revealed four new
molecular targets, including FbpA, MurC, MmpL3 and GlpK.
