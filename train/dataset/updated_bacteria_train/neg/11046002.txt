CD1 molecules can present microbial lipid Ag to T cells, suggesting that they
participate in host defense against pathogens. In this study, we examined the
role of CD1d in resistance to infection with the Lyme disease spirochete,
Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), an organism with proinflammatory lipid Ag. Bb
infection of CD1d-deficient (CD1d(-/-)) mouse strains normally resistant to this 
pathogen resulted in arthritis. Pathology correlated with an increased prevalence
of spirochete DNA in tissues and enhanced production of Bb-specific IgG,
including IgG to Ag rapidly down-modulated on spirochetes in vivo. CD1d(-/-) mice
exhibited high-titer Bb-specific IgG2a, an isotype commonly induced in
disease-susceptible mice but not in the disease-resistant control mice in this
study. These results show that CD1d deficiency impairs host resistance to a
spirochete pathogen, and are the first example of a mutation that imparts
Bb-resistant mice with the Ab and disease profile of a susceptible mouse strain.
