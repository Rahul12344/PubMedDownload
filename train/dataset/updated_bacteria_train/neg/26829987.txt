A long-standing question in the field of tumor immunotherapy is how Th2 cytokines
block tumor growth. Their antitumor effects are particularly prominent when they 
are secreted continuously in tumors, suggesting that Th2 cytokines may create a
tumor microenvironment unfavorable for tumor growth independently of adaptive
immunity. In this study, we show that local production of IL-33 establishes a
high number of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) with potent antitumor
activity. IL-33 promotes secretion of a massive amount of CXCR2 ligands from
ILC2s but creates a tumor microenvironment where tumor cells express CXCR2
through a dysfunctional angiogenesis/hypoxia/reactive oxygen species axis. These 
two signaling events converge to reinforce tumor cell-specific apoptosis through 
CXCR2. Our results identify a previously unrecognized antitumor therapeutic
pathway wherein ILC2s play a central role.
