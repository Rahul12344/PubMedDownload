Escherichia coli ClpYQ protease and Lon protease possess a redundant function for
degradation of SulA, a cell division inhibitor. An experimental cue implied that 
the capsule synthesis activator RcsA, a known substrate of Lon, is probably a
specific substrate for the ClpYQ protease. This paper shows that overexpression
of ClpQ and ClpY suppresses the mucoid phenotype of a lon mutant. Since the cpsB 
(wcaB) gene, involved in capsule synthesis, is activated by RcsA, the reporter
construct cpsB-lacZ was used to assay for beta-galactosidase activity and thus
follow RcsA stability. The expression of cpsB-lacZ was increased in double
mutants of lon in combination with clpQ or/and clpY mutation(s) compared with the
wild-type or lon single mutants. Overproduction of ClpYQ or ClpQ decreased
cpsB-lacZ expression. Additionally, a P(BAD)-rcsA fusion construct showed
quantitatively that an inducible RcsA activates cpsB-lacZ expression. The effect 
of RcsA on cpsB-lacZ expression was shown to be influenced by the ClpYQ
activities. Moreover, a rcsA(Red)-lacZ translational fusion construct showed
higher activity of RcsA(Red)-LacZ in a clpQ clpY strain than in the wild-type. By
contrast, overproduction of cellular ClpYQ resulted in decreased
beta-galactosidase levels of RcsA(Red)-LacZ. Taken together, the data indicate
that ClpYQ acts as a secondary protease in degrading the Lon substrate RcsA.
