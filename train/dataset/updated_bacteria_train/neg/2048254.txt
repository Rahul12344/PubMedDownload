[Clinical features of nonclostridium anaerobic infection in the pathology of
E.N.T. organs].

[Article in Russian]

Mironov AIu, Mironov AA.

The study of clinical features of nonclostridial anaerobic infection in 80
patients with purulent and inflammatory pathologies of ENT-organs (purulent
sinusitis, purulent otitis media, paratonsillar abscesses) showed them to be as
follows: prolonged, slow and often subclinical development of the disease;
disseminated necrotic changes of tissues; disagreement between the level of
clinical symptoms and destructive changes (prevalence of destructive changes over
clinical symptoms); phenomenon of false anesthesia; existence of crumbs-like pus 
with a strong bad smell sometimes filled with air bubbles; limited bleeding from 
cut tissues.
