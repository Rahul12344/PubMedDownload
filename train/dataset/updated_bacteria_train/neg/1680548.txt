To investigate the possible involvement of topoisomerases in embryonal
differentiation, we examined the effect of topoisomerase inhibitors on the in
vitro differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. We found that
camptothecin, teniposide (VM-26), or genistein, specific inhibitors of
topoisomerases, induced morphological as well as biochemical changes (production 
of tissue plasminogen activator, synthesis of laminin, and disappearance of
stage-specific embryonic antigen 1) specific to F9 cell differentiation. Since
these changes were indistinguishable from those observed in F9 differentiation
induced by retinoic acid (plus dibutyryl cyclic AMP), it was suggested that
inhibition of cellular topoisomerase activities triggered F9 cell differentiation
into parietal endoderm-like cells in the same manner as retinoic acid (plus
dibutyryl cyclic AMP). Experiments using differentiation-resistant mutant F9 cell
lines, however, indicated that the molecular cascade involved in topoisomerase
inhibitor-induced differentiation involves different steps from those functioning
in the retinoic acid-induced differentiation cascade.
