Natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize lipid antigens, such as glycosphingolipids
(GSLs), via CD1d and contribute to host defense against various pathogens. Here, 
we demonstrate that GSLs isolated from Sphingomonas bacteria and inserted into
liposomes (GSL-liposomes) enhance the activation of NKT cells and dendritic cells
(DCs). GSL-liposomes remarkably enhanced the production of IFN-gamma from
splenocytes in vitro and this enhancement depended on the content of the
pH-sensitive lipid dioleoyl-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the liposomes.
GSL-liposomes containing DOPE were clearly broken in late endosomes and this may 
facilitate effective loading of GSLs onto CD1 molecules. Treatment with
GSL-liposomes also activated NKT cells and DCs in vivo. Collectively, our results
strongly suggest that GSL-liposomes can effectively induce NKT cell-mediated
immune responses and may be useful as an immune adjuvant for inducing protective 
immunity.
