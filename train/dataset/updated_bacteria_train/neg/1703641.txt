The authors present an extremely rare case of aspergillosis of the central
nervous system (CNS) causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 78-year-old female 
developed facial pain, progressive deterioration in left visual acuity, and left 
total ophthalmoplegia. Computed tomography demonstrated a heterogeneously
enhanced mass extending from the sphenoid sinus to the left cavernous sinus and
left orbit, and angiography showed luminal narrowing and irregularity of the left
internal carotid artery at its siphon. Biopsy of the left orbital and sphenoid
sinus mass resulted in the diagnosis of Aspergillus granuloma. Despite combined
administration of amphotericin-B and 5-FC, she became comatose from brainstem
infarction and finally, suddenly died. Postmortem examination revealed massive
SAH due to a ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the basilar artery. Aspergillosis of
the CNS is a growing problem with the wider use of immunosuppressants and
antibiotics. To the authors' knowledge, however, only 13 cases of CNS
aspergillosis causing SAH have been reported. The prognosis is absolutely bad,
with all patients dying from rupture of major intracranial arteries such as the
internal carotid artery and basilar artery. Early diagnosis and vigorous
chemotherapy are important.
