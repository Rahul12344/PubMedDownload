A series of Novel Bacterial Topoisomerase Inhibitors (NBTIs) employing a linker
derived from isomannide were synthesized and evaluated. Reduced hERG inhibition
was observed compared to structure-matched analogues with different linkers, and 
compound 6 showed minimal proarrhythmic potential using an in vitro panel of
cardiac ion channels. Compound 6 also displayed excellent activity against
fluoroquinolone-resistant MRSA (MIC90 = 2 μg/mL) and other Gram-positive
pathogens.
