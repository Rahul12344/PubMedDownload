Objectives: Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogenic bacteria causing the
infection listeriosis, which possibly affects all people, particularly
immunocompromised persons and pregnant women. This microorganism can be found in 
several processed foods, dairy products, raw milk, meat and fish products,
seafoods, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. This review discusses about the
epidemiological significance, incidence, contamination routes of L. monocytogenes
in different products and current data about listeriosis in the Iran.
Materials and Methods: For accessing to relevant articles and studies, a search
was done in main databases and also, almost all Iranian published articles were
studied in this field.
Results: Outbreaks of listeriosis have been reported in many parts of the
worldwide, however there is scanty data about the prevalence of listeriosis in
Iran. Accordingly, as a result of high incidence of L. monocytogenes in women
with bad obstetric history or history of abortions, diagnosis procedures for
detection of L. monocytogenes and timely treatment was suggested.
Conclusion: In spite of low incidence of infection in the past, increased
interest for lightly preserved and/or ready-to-eat (RTE) food products has
recently led to increasing of L. monocytogenes prevalence which has become a
public health concern. Subsequently, further researches about the prevalence of
L. monocytogenes and also antibiotic susceptibility testing is needed to enable
the detection of the contaminated foods, as well as ensures the effective
treatment.
