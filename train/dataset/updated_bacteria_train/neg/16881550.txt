We report a case of cervical abscess after the ingestion of foreign body (chicken
bone) secondary to probable esophageal perforation that it was sent to us with
suspicion of mediastinal complication. The girl, 17 years-old, nothing else to
arrive our hospitalary center required entrance in ICU due to her severe clinical
process: High fever, intense neck-thoracic pain, laterocervical diffuse and
progressive left inflammation and bad general state. The CT showed the presence
of a well defined abscess and abundant aerial component that dissected the
cervical muscles that made necessary to perform drainage verifying
intraoperatively no mediastinal involvement. The culture of the purulent
collection revealed Streptococcus anginosus/milleri resistant to clindamicine but
sensible to penicilina and derivatives. We exposed a serie of considerations at
respect of such microorganism and its clinical signification.
