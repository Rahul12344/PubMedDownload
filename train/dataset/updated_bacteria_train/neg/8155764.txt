BACKGROUND: Despite the efficacy of modern antimicrobials bacteremia by anaerobes
(AB) continues to present a high mortality rate. The aim of this study was to
determine the relative frequency and clinical significance of isolations of
anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures and to know the prognostic factors of AB.
METHODS: From total of 231 patients observed over a period of six and a half
years in the Fundación Jiménez Díaz, 131 episodes of AB were retrospectively
analyzed with special attention being given to microbiologic, epidemiologic and
clinical factors.
RESULTS: The relative frequency of AB was 7.5%. Clinical significance was found
in 86 out of the 131 episodes (66%). The isolation of Bacteroides spp. was
clinically significant in 89% while Clostridium spp. was so only in 33% (p <
0.001). Mortality related with AB was 32%. The following factors were considered 
related to bad prognosis statistical analysis (p < 0.05): admission to medical
areas, rapid and finally fatal underlying disease, presence of septic shock,
renal failure, inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and the absence of drainage 
for the septic foci.
CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic bacteremia remains an important cause of bacteremia and
carries a high mortality rate. Two thirds of the episodes of anaerobic bacteremia
are deemed to be clinically significant. Correct antimicrobian treatment and
surgical drainage of any septic foci significantly improves prognosis.
