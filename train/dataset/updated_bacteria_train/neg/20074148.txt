Recently, there has been strong interest in the therapeutic potential of
probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). At the same time, there is a
rapidly growing body of evidence to support an etiological role for
gastrointestinal infection and the associated immune activation in the
development of post-infectious IBS. In a more controversial area, small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been associated with a subset of patients
with IBS; the issue of whether it is appropriate to treat a subset of IBS
patients with antibiotics and probiotics is currently a matter for debate. Thus, 
it appears that the gastrointestinal microbial flora may exert beneficial effects
for symptoms of IBS under some circumstances, while in other situations gut
microbes could give rise to symptoms of IBS. How do we make sense of the
apparently diverse roles that 'bugs' may play in IBS? To address this question,
we have conducted an in-depth review, attempting where possible to draw lessons
from Asian studies.
