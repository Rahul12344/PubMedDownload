Bicomponent pore-forming leukocidins are a family of potent toxins secreted by
Staphylococcus aureus, which target white blood cells preferentially and consist 
of an S- and an F-component. The S-component recognizes a receptor on the host
cell, enabling high-affinity binding to the cell surface, after which the toxins 
form a pore that penetrates the cell lipid bilayer. Until now, six different
leukocidins have been described, some of which are host and cell specific. Here, 
we identify and characterise a novel S. aureus leukocidin; LukPQ. LukPQ is
encoded on a 45 kb prophage (ΦSaeq1) found in six different clonal lineages,
almost exclusively in strains cultured from equids. We show that LukPQ is a
potent and specific killer of equine neutrophils and identify equine-CXCRA and
CXCR2 as its target receptors. Although the S-component (LukP) is highly similar 
to the S-component of LukED, the species specificity of LukPQ and LukED differs. 
By forming non-canonical toxin pairs, we identify that the F-component
contributes to the observed host tropism of LukPQ, thereby challenging the
current paradigm that leukocidin specificity is driven solely by the S-component.
