Psoriasis is a multifactorial immune skin disease whose etiology involves a
strong genetic component, involving several genes encoding proteins involved in
epidermal differentiation and immune, inflammatory and pathogen responses, in
combination with microbial environmental factors. Although various microorganisms
appear to provoke or aggravate the disease, including Staphylococcus aureus,
Malassezia and Candida albicans, the association between S. pyogenes throat
infections and guttate psoriasis is supported by the strongest clinical evidence.
Furthermore, the identification of peptidoglycan-specific T cells in psoriatic
skin lesions has led to the proposal that cell wall peptidoglycan may mediate the
link between streptococcal infection in the tonsils and the subsequent induction 
of skin lesions. These findings suggest that psoriasis may be a possible
candidate for therapeutic streptococcal vaccination. Current treatments for
psoriasis have several limitations including toxicity and an increased risk of
infection and malignancy. In contrast, vaccination could potentially induce
long-term tolerance without the side effects caused by global immunosuppression. 
Future research will need to address the identity of the triggering microbial
antigen(s); such knowledge could open the way for vaccination as a therapeutic
tool for psoriasis.
