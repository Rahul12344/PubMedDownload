Four novel killer-cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) genes were discovered by analysis
of genomic DNA from a human donor. One gene, KIR2DL5, is expressed by
subpopulations of NK cells and T cells, whereas expression of the other three
genes could not be detected. KIR2DL5 has two extracellular Ig-like domains of the
D0 and D2 type, a structural configuration that was previously unique to KIR2DL4.
Although having a similar structure overall, the KIR2DL4 and KIR2DL5 receptors
have distinctive amino acid sequences in the ligand-binding extracellular domains
and differ in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic motifs that determine signal
transduction. Whereas the KIR2DL4 gene is present on all KIR haplotypes and is
expressed by all human NK cells, the KIR2DL5 gene is restricted to the "B" subset
of KIR haplotypes and is clonally expressed by NK cells within an individual.
Chimpanzee genes for KIR2DL4 and KIR2DL5 have been defined and are very similar
in sequence to their human orthologs. The donor in whom KIR2DL5 was first
detected bears two variants of it that differ by five nucleotide substitutions in
the coding region. Although the substitutions are not predicted to affect gene
expression, transcription of only one of the two KIR2DL5 variants could be
detected.
