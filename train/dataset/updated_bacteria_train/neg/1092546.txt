Properties of ATP and UTP analogues with P-S-C-5' bonds.

St√ºtz A, Scheit KH.

Analogues of ATP and UTP bearing C-5'-S-P ester bonds were found not to be
substrates but weak competitive inhibitors of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.
The K-i values of the analogues obtained in the transcription of poly[d(A-T)] or 
poly(dT) under various conditions are in the order of millimolar. Evidence was
derived from proton magnetic resonance spectra that nucleotides with C-5'-S-P
bonds do not exist in gauche-gauche conformation normally adopted by natural
occurring nucleotides. This leads us to assume that the gauche-gauche
conformation is an essental prerequisite for substrates of RNA polymerase.
Ado-5'-S-PPP substituted for ATP as substrate of hexokinase from yeast rather
effectively thus indicating that a distinct stereochemical orientation of the
alpha-phosphate ester bond is not a stringent requirement for substrates of this 
enzyme.
