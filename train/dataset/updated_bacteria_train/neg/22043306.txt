Comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of epigenetic regulation requires
identification of molecules bound to genomic regions of interest in vivo.
However, non-biased methods to identify molecules bound to specific genomic loci 
in vivo are limited. Here, we applied insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation
(iChIP) to direct identification of components of insulator complexes, which
function as boundaries of chromatin domain. We found that the chicken Î²-globin
HS4 (cHS4) insulator complex contains an RNA helicase protein, p68/DDX5; an RNA
species, steroid receptor RNA activator 1; and a nuclear matrix protein,
Matrin-3, in vivo. Binding of p68 and Matrin-3 to the cHS4 insulator core
sequence was mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Thus, our results showed
that it is feasible to directly identify proteins and RNA bound to a specific
genomic region in vivo by using iChIP.
