We have previously shown that some Escherichia coli strains isolated from
children with diarrhea present the so-called 'localized and diffused adherence
(LA/DA) pattern' in which both localized adherence (LA) and diffused adherence
(DA) are expressed simultaneously. In the present study, we show that the LA
adherence of these strains is genetically and phenotypically similar to that so
far described for enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) as determined by DNA
hybridization and electron microscopy. On the other hand, the DA is encoded by
genes not homologous to the DAEC or AIDA-I DNA probes. In addition, the LA/DA
strains are able to invade eukaryotic cells both in vitro and in vivo. In the
rabbit ileal loop assay their invasion capacity goes beyond the enterocyte and
reaches the muscularis mucosae as determined by transmission electron microscopy.
These findings suggest that the LA/DA adherence pattern may be linked to a new E.
coli virulence category which in the case of the strains studied may be
associated to other virulence traits that enable them to more deeply invade the
intestinal mucosa.
