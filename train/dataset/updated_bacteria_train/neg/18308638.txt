CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) have been
identified as an important type of effector and regulatory T cell, but their
roles in the chronic infectious diseases caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
Mycobacterium leprae remain poorly defined. Here, we studied circulating human
iNKT cells in blood samples from tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy patients. We found
that the percentages of iNKT cells among total circulating T cells in TB and
leprosy patients were not significantly different from those in normal controls. 
However, both TB and leprosy patients showed a selective reduction of the
proinflammatory CD4(-)CD8beta(-) (DN) iNKT cells with a proportionate increase in
the CD4(+) iNKT cells. Similar phenotypic alterations in circulating iNKT cells
were observed in a mouse model of M. tuberculosis infection. Taken together,
these findings indicate that the selective reduction of circulating DN iNKT cells
is associated with chronic infections caused by M. tuberculosis and M. leprae.
