The polarity protein Par-3 plays critical roles in axon specification and the
establishment of epithelial apico-basal polarity. Par-3 associates with Par-6 and
atypical protein kinase C and is required for the proper assembly of tight
junctions, but the molecular basis for its functions is poorly understood. We now
report that depletion of Par-3 elevates the phosphorylated pool of cofilin, a key
regulator of actin dynamics. Expression of a nonphosphorylatable mutant of
cofilin partially rescues tight junction assembly in cells lacking Par-3, as does
the depletion of LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2), an upstream kinase for cofilin. Par-3
binds to LIMK2 but not to the related kinase LIMK1. Par-3 inhibits LIMK2 activity
in vitro, and overexpressed Par-3 suppresses cofilin phosphorylation that is
induced by lysophosphatidic acid. Our findings identify LIMK2 as a novel target
of Par-3 and uncover a molecular mechanism by which Par-3 could regulate actin
dynamics during cell polarization.
