In this chapter we describe the methods currently used for subgrouping Legionella
pneumophila and other non-pneumophila species. In the first part we describe
monoclonal antibody (mAb) subgrouping, either by indirect immunofluorescence or
indirect ELISA methods. These monoclonal antibodies are not commercially
available but can be obtained for noncommercial purposes from one of the authors.
Further, we describe pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment 
length polymorphism (AFLP) and sequence-based typing (SBT) as well standardized
and reproducible methods for genotyping. The SBT schema is currently available
for L. pneumophila whereas PFGE and AFLP can be used for all Legionella species. 
For certain applications it might be useful to use spoligotyping to distinguish
strains belonging to the same sequence type (ST).
