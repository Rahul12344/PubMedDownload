The action of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (S-Ado-Hcy), its four structural
analogues S-Ino-Hcy, S-Guo-Hcy, S-Urd-Hcy, S-Cyd-Hcy and the five corresponding
sulfoxides on tRNA methylases has been investigated. The data obtained in the
study of overall incorporation of 14CH3-groups into an unfractioned tRNA
preparation suggested that both the affinity of the inhibitors tested for various
methylases and the type of inhibition were different. The experiments performed
with unfractioned tRNA preparation permit to get an idea of the average
inhibitory potency of each of the compounds. The study of their action on
individual tRNA methylases by means of fractionation of minor components produced
demonstrated that the affinity of the inhibitors tested for various methylases
was really different. Thus, S-Ado-Hcy, S-Ino-Hcy and S-Urd-Hcy practically do not
inhibit m1A methylase but have the highest affinity for m5C methylase. In an
experiment with tRNAPhe which is a substrate for a single, namely m5C methylase, 
the type of inhibition of this methylase by S-Cyd-Hcy was revealed; it was found 
to be non-competitive with respect to S-Ado-Met, and the S-Cyd-Hcy concentration 
reducing the methylation by 50 percent was 1.2-10(-4) M.
