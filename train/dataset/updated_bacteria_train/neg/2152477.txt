This study reports the clinico-biologic characteristics, complications and the
final events in 224 cases of meningococcal disease observed during a period of
five years in the province of Cordoba. The prognostic factors of the disease were
also evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups according to the
diagnosis: meningitis, meningococcemia, and meningitis with meningococcemia. The 
incidence of each group was 18%, 22% and 60%, respectively. The 81.7% of the
patients were below the age of 14 years. The most frequent symptoms were the
fever (97.8%), vomitus (75%) and headache (52.2%) The more common exploratory
findings were petechiae (76.8%) and nuchal rigidity (53.6%). Complications
related to the illness were present in 27.3% of the cases. The clinical course
showed a mortality rate of 6.3% with a complete recovery in 91% of patients.
Sequelae was present in 2.7% of the cases. The absence of previous antibiotic
therapy (p < 0.05), the presence of nuchal rigidity (p < 0.05), shock (p < 0.01),
coma (p < 0.05), leukocytopenia (p < 0.001), and a prothrombin activity lower
than 70% (p < 0.05) were associated with a bad prognosis.
