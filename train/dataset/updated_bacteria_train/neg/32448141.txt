BACKGROUND: Skin lesions and dermatoses in cattle are often associated with
infections due to bacteria, fungi or environmental risk factors. Dermatoses with 
genetic etiology have been described in cattle. Among these rare disorders, there
are primary congenital dermatoses that are associated with inherited nutritional 
deficiencies, such as bovine hereditary zinc deficiency or zinc deficiency-like
syndrome. This study presents three cases of Holstein cattle with congenital skin
lesions observed on a single farm that resemble zinc deficiency-like syndrome.
Close clinical and pathological examinations took place in two cases. Pedigree
analysis indicated autosomal recessive inheritance and whole-genome sequencing of
both affected calves was performed.
RESULTS: The two calves showed retarded growth and suffered from severe
ulcerative dermatitis with hyperkeratosis, alopecia furunculosis and subcutaneous
abscess formation. Blood analysis showed correspondent leukocytosis with
neutrophilia whereas minerals, macro- and micronutrients were within the
reference ranges. Variant calling and filtering against the 1000 Bull Genomes
variant catalogue resulted in the detection of a single homozygous
protein-changing variant exclusively present in both sequenced genomes. This
single-nucleotide deletion in exon 3 of IL17RA on bovine chromosome 5 was
predicted to have a deleterious impact on the encoded protein due to a frameshift
leading to a truncated gene product. Genotyping of the affected cattle family
confirmed recessive inheritance.
CONCLUSIONS: A loss-of-function mutation of the IL17RA transmembrane protein
could be identified as most likely pathogenic variant for the psoriasis-like skin
alterations observed in the two affected Holstein calves. In man, rare recessive 
diseases associated with IL17RA include immunodeficiency 51 and chronic
mucocutaneous candidiasis. This supports the observed immunodeficiency of the
presented cases. This study reports the first naturally occurring
IL17RA-associated animal model.
