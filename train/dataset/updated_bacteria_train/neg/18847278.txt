Exploration of actinomycetes for isolation of natural products for abrogating
TRAIL resistance led to the isolation of two new tyrosine derivatives (1 and 2)
along with novobiocin (3). The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by
spectroscopic methods, while the absolute configuration was determined by
analyzing CD spectra and by a modified Marfey's method. Compounds 1 (150 μM) and 
3 (37.5 and 75 μM) in combination with TRAIL showed synergistic activity in
sensitizing TRAIL-resistant human gastric adenocarcinoma cells.
