This study, we present evidence for a negatively acting control mechanism that
coordinately suppresses the synthesis of the Th2 lymphokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6.
This control mechanism operates in the murine thymoma cell line BW 5147. When
cells of this line were fused to four independently established, well-defined Th2
cell clones, all resulting 74 lymphokine-secreting hybridomas secreted IL-2 which
was not secreted by any of the parental Th2 cell clones. Most interestingly,
however, none of the 74 hybridomas retained the capacity of the parental Th2
cells to express IL-4. Likewise, the secretion of IL-5 and IL-6 was also
suppressed. Obviously, BW 5147 cells dominated the pattern of lymphokines
produced, although the lymphokine pattern of Th2 cells was previously considered 
to be irreversibly fixed due to terminal differentiation of these cells.
Suppression of IL-4 production was also observed at the mRNA level, as tested in 
Northern blot assays. Putative DNA target sequences for suppression of IL-4 gene 
transcription were not part of the proximal IL-4 promotor regions. Remote DNA
control sequences may exist which coordinately regulate the proper,
stage-specific expression of the Th2 lymphokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6.
