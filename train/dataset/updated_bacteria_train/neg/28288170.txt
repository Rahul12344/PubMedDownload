OBJECTIVE: To clarify therapeutic effects of azithromycin, clarithromycin,
minocycline and tosufloxacin against macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae
(MRMP) pneumonia and against macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MSMP)
pneumonia in pediatric patients.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter observational study was conducted from July
2013 to August 2015. The therapeutic effects of azithromycin, clarithromycin,
minocycline and tosufloxacin were evaluated in 59 patients with pneumonia caused 
by MRMP and in 50 patients with pneumonia caused by MSMP. In vitro activities of 
antimicrobial agents against isolates of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were also
measured.
RESULTS: Mean durations of fever following commencement of treatment in patients 
infected with MRMP and MSMP were 5.2 and 1.9 days, respectively (log-rank test, P
< 0.0001). Among patients infected with MRMP, mean durations of fever were 4.6,
5.5, 1.0 and 7.5 days for patients treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin,
minocycline and tosufloxacin, respectively (log-rank test, P < 0.0001). Among
patients infected with MSMP, mean durations of fever were 2.5, 1.7, 0.9 and 4.3
days for patients treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, minocycline and
tosufloxacin, respectively (log-rank test, P = 0.0162). The MIC90s of
azithromycin and clarithromycin among the 27 isolates of MRMP were 64 and 256
μg/ml, respectively, and those among the 23 isolates of MSMP were <0.000125 and
0.001 μg/ml, respectively. The MIC90s of minocycline and tosufloxacin among the
27 isolates of MRMP were 1.0 and 0.25 μg/ml, respectively, and those among the 23
isolates of MSMP were 1.0 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Both minocycline and tosufloxacin showed good in vitro activities
against MRMP. Minocycline, but not tosufloxacin, shortened the duration of fever 
in pediatric patients infected with MRMP compared to the duration of fever in
patients treated with macrolides.
