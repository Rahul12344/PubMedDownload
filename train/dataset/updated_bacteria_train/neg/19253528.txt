OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical diagnosis, course and combined therapy of
aggressive rhinocerebral mucormycosis.
METHOD: The clinical feature, diagnosis and therapy were analyzed in 5 cases with
rhinocerebral mucormycosis throughout disease progress. Good treatments were
found by analyzing curative effect of different treatment.
RESULT: One patient died within three weeks in hospital three patients survived
from 2 months to 2 years; and one patient was alive over 3 years. The mortality
rate was 80% in this study.
CONCLUSION: Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is always secondary to patients with
severe diseases and bad immunologic function. The lesion can invade the orbit and
brain quickly, and the mortality rate is high. The cause of the disease can be
retarded by clearing up the focus early and removing the environment of fungi
thriving with combined therapy. It is effective of remodelling the necrotic
tissues by nasal endoscopy.
