Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was performed on 257 Phytophthora infestans
isolates belonging to four clonal lineages to study within-lineage diversity. The
four lineages used in the study were US-8 (n = 28), US-11 (n = 27), US-23 (n =
166), and US-24 (n = 36), with isolates originating from 23 of the United States 
and Ontario, Canada. The majority of isolates were collected between 2010 and
2014 (94%), with the remaining isolates collected from 1994 to 2009, and 2015.
Between 3,774 and 5,070 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified
within each lineage and were used to investigate relationships among individuals.
K-means hierarchical clustering revealed three clusters within lineage US-23,
with US-23 isolates clustering more by collection year than by geographic origin.
K-means hierarchical clustering did not reveal significant clustering within the 
smaller US-8, US-11, and US-24 data sets. Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were also
constructed for each lineage. All four NJ trees revealed evidence for pathogen
dispersal and overwintering within regions, as well as long-distance pathogen
transport across regions. In the US-23 NJ tree, grouping by year was more
prominent than grouping by region, which indicates the importance of
long-distance pathogen transport as a source of initial late blight inoculum. Our
results support previous studies that found significant genetic diversity within 
clonal lineages of P. infestans and show that GBS offers sufficiently high
resolution to detect sub-structuring within clonal populations.
