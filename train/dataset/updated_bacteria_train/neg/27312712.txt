BACKGROUND: Our microbial companions (the "microbiota") are extremely important
for the preservation of human health. Although changes in bacterial communities
(dysbiosis) are commonly associated with disease, such changes have also been
described in healthy pregnancies, where the microbiome plays an essential role in
maternal and child health outcomes, including normal immune and metabolic
function in later life. Nevertheless, this new understanding of the importance of
the microbiome has not yet influenced contemporary clinical practice regarding
antibiotic use during pregnancy.
DISCUSSION: Antibiotic treatment during pregnancy is widespread in Western
countries, and accounts for 80Â % of prescribed medications in pregnancy. However,
antibiotic treatment, while at times lifesaving, can also have detrimental
consequences. A single course of antibiotics perturbs bacterial communities, with
evidence that the microbial ecosystem does not return completely to baseline
following treatment. Antibiotics in pregnancy should be used only when indicated,
choosing those with the narrowest range possible. Bacteria are essential for
normal human development and, while antibiotic treatment during pregnancy has an 
important role in controlling and preventing infections, it may have undesired
effects regarding the maternal and fetoplacental microbiomes. We expect that
microbiota manipulation in pregnancy, through the use of probiotics and fecal
microbiota transplantation, will be the subject of increasing clinical interest.
