A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig was constructed across the
proximal part of the H2-M region from the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) 
of mouse strain 129 (H2bc). The contig is composed of 28 clones that span
approximately 1 megabasepair (Mb), from H2-T1 to Mog, and contains three H2-T
genes and 18 H2-M genes. We report the fine mapping of the H2-M class I gene
cluster, which includes the previously reported M4-M6, the M1 family, the M10
family, and four additional class I genes. All but two of the H2-M class I genes 
are conserved among haplotypes H2k, H2b, and H2bc, and only two genes are found
in polymorphic HindIII fragments. Six evolutionarily conserved non-class I genes 
were mapped to a 180 kilobase interval in the distal part of the class I region
in mouse, and their order Znf173-Rfb30-Tctex5-Tctex6- Tctex4-Mog was found
conserved between human and mouse. In this Znf173-Mog interval, three mouse class
I genes, M6, M4, and M5, which are conserved among haplotypes, occupy the same
map position as the human HLA-A class I cluster, which varies among haplotypes
and is diverged in sequence from the mouse genes. These results further support
the view that class I gene diverge and evolve independently between species.
