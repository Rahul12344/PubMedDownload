Mental health is becoming a public health priority worldwide. Anorexia nervosa
and autism spectrum disorders are 2 important types of childhood disorders with a
bad prognosis. They share cognitive impairments and, in both cases, the
microbiota appears to be a crucial factor. Alteration of the microbiota-gut-brain
axis is an appealing hypothesis to define new pathophysiological mechanisms.
Mucosal immunity plays a key role between the microbiota and the brain. The
mucosal immune system receives and integrates messages from the intestinal
microenvironment and the microbiota and then transmits the information to the
nervous system. Abnormalities in this sensorial system may be involved in the
natural history of mental diseases and might play a role in their maintenance.
This review aims to highlight data about the relationship between intestinal
mucosal immunity and these disorders. We show that shared cognitive impairments
could be found in these 2 disorders, which both present dysbiosis. This
literature review provides details on the immune status of anorexic and autistic 
patients, with a focus on intestinal mucosal factors. Finally, we suggest future 
research hypotheses that seem important for understanding the implication of the 
gut-brain-axis in psychiatric diseases.
