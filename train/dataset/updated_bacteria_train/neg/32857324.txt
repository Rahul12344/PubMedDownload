PURPOSE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological cancer
with limited therapeutic options for adult patients. Aurora kinases have drawn
attention as potential targets in hematological neoplasms due to their high
expression and biological functions. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and AURKB are
essential for a successful mitosis, acting in spindle mitotic organization and
cytokinesis. Reversine is a synthetic purine analog that acts as a multi-kinase
inhibitor with anti-neoplastic activity by targeting AURKA and AURKB.
METHODS: ALL patient gene expression data were retrieved from the Amazonia!
DATABASE: For functional assays, Jurkat (T-ALL) and Namalwa (B-ALL) cells were
exposed to increasing concentrations of reversine and submitted to various
cellular and molecular assays.
RESULTS: We found that AURKB expression was higher in ALL patient samples
compared to normal lymphocytes (p < 0.0001). The ALL cell lines tested displayed 
aberrant AURKA and AURKB expression. In Jurkat and Namalwa cells, reversine
reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Reversine
also significantly reduced the viability of primary ALL cells. Reversine induced 
apoptosis and autophagy, and reduced cell proliferation in both cell lines
(p < 0.05). Mitotic catastrophe markers, including cell cycle arrest at G2/M,
increased cell size and DNA damage, were observed upon reversine exposure. Short-
and long-term treatment with reversine inhibited autonomous clonogenicity
(p < 0.05). At the molecular level, reversine reduced AURKB activity, induced
SQSTM1/p62 consumption, and increased LC3BII and γ-H2AX levels. In Namalwa cells,
reversine modulated 25 out of 84 autophagy-related genes, including BCL2, BAD,
ULK1, ATG10, IRGM and MAP1LC3B, which indicates that reversine acts by initiating
and sustaining autophagy signals in ALL cells.
CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that reversine reduces the viability of
ALL cells by triggering multiple cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis,
mitotic catastrophe, and autophagy. Our findings highlight reversine as a
potential anticancer agent for ALL.
