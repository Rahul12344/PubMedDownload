17α-Methyltestosterone (MT), a synthetic anabolic androgenic steroid, is widely
used in aquafarming for the production of an all male fish population such as
Nile tilapia. This study isolated, identified and characterized MT-degrading
bacteria in the sediment and water from a masculinizing pond of Nile tilapia fry.
Based on the phylogeny, physiological properties and cell morphology, the three
isolated MT-degrading bacteria were related closely to Rhodococcus equi,
Nocardioides aromaticivorans, and Nocardioides nitrophenolicus. Growth of the
three isolated strains was found to be inhibited for MT concentrations in the
range of 1.0-10mg/L. The inhibition of cell growth was found to be modeled using 
the Haldane's substrate inhibition model. The kinetic constants ranged from 0.13 
to 0.19h(-1) for μ(max), 0.7-24.8mg/L for K(s) and 19.6-76.2mg/L for K(i).
Androgenic activity using β-galactosidase assay showed that all strains degraded 
MT to the products with no androgenic potency.
