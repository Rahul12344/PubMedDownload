The mountain river showed fecal water pollution at all sample sites studied. The 
arithmetic mean values of total coliforms ranged between 28 and 196/ml.
Campylobacters were isolated from all sample sites studied, with a maximum value 
of 1,100 Campylobacter/100 ml river water. The MCCD-medium resulted in
significantly higher isolation rates of Campylobacter from water samples than the
VTPRC-medium compared. Colony counts, total coliforms and Campylobacter showed
numerical relations of 3831:100:1 respectively.
