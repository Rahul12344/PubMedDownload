During an immune response, natural killer (NK) cells activate specific metabolic 
pathways to meet the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands associated with
effector functions. Here, we found in vivo activation of NK cells during Listeria
monocytogenes infection-augmented transcription of genes encoding
mitochondria-associated proteins in a manner dependent on the transcriptional
coactivator PGC-1α. Using an Ncr1Cre-based conditional knockout mouse, we found
that PGC-1α was crucial for optimal NK cell effector functions and bioenergetics,
as the deletion of PGC-1α was associated with decreased cytotoxic potential and
cytokine production along with altered ADP/ATP ratios. Lack of PGC-1α also
significantly impaired the ability of NK cells to control B16F10 tumor growth
in vivo, and subsequent gene expression analysis showed that PGC-1α mediates
transcription required to maintain mitochondrial activity within the tumor
microenvironment. Together, these data suggest that PGC-1α-dependent
transcription of specific target genes is required for optimal NK cell function
during the response to infection or tumor growth.
