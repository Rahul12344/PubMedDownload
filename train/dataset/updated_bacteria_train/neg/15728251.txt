Factors that regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton are critical in determining
cell behavior. Here we describe the function of a novel protein that we term
E-like based on its sequence similarity to the tubulin-specific chaperone
cofactor E. We find that upon overexpression, E-like depolymerizes microtubules
by committing tubulin to proteosomal degradation. Our data suggest that this
function is direct and is based on the ability of E-like to disrupt the tubulin
heterodimer in vitro. Suppression of E-like expression results in an increase in 
the number of stable microtubules and a tight clustering of endocellular
membranes around the microtubule-organizing center, while the properties of
dynamic microtubules are unaffected. These observations define E-like as a novel 
regulator of tubulin stability, and provide a link between tubulin turnover and
vesicle transport.
