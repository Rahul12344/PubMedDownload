BACKGROUND: Outbreaks caused by asexual lineages of fungal and oomycete pathogens
are a continuing threat to crops, wild animals and natural ecosystems (Fisher MC,
Henk DA, Briggs CJ, Brownstein JS, Madoff LC, McCraw SL, Gurr SJ, Nature
484:186-194, 2012; Kupferschmidt K, Science 337:636-638, 2012). However, the
mechanisms underlying genome evolution and phenotypic plasticity in asexual
eukaryotic microbes remain poorly understood (Seidl MF, Thomma BP, BioEssays
36:335-345, 2014). Ever since the 19th century Irish famine, the oomycete
Phytophthora infestans has caused recurrent outbreaks on potato and tomato crops 
that have been primarily caused by the successive rise and migration of pandemic 
asexual lineages (Goodwin SB, Cohen BA, Fry WE, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
91:11591-11595, 1994; Yoshida K, Burbano HA, Krause J, Thines M, Weigel D, Kamoun
S, PLoS Pathog 10:e1004028, 2014; Yoshida K, Schuenemann VJ, Cano LM, Pais M,

KL, Farrer RA, Gilroy EM, Goss EM, et al. PLoS Pathog 8:e1002940, 2012). However,
the dynamics of genome evolution within these clonal lineages have not been
determined. The objective of this study was to use a comparative genomics and
transcriptomics approach to determine the molecular mechanisms that underpin
phenotypic variation within a clonal lineage of P. infestans.
RESULTS: Here, we reveal patterns of genomic and gene expression variation within
a P. infestans asexual lineage by comparing strains belonging to the South
American EC-1 clone that has dominated Andean populations since the 1990s
(Yoshida K, Burbano HA, Krause J, Thines M, Weigel D, Kamoun S, PLoS Pathog
10e1004028, 2014; Yoshida K, Schuenemann VJ, Cano LM, Pais M, Mishra B, Sharma R,

BA, Doucett K, Fry WE, Phytopathology 87:375-380, 1997; Oyarzun PJ, Pozo A,
Ordonez ME, Doucett K, Forbes GA, Phytopathology 88:265-271, 1998). We detected
numerous examples of structural variation, nucleotide polymorphisms and loss of
heterozygosity within the EC-1 clone. Remarkably, 17 genes are not expressed in
one of the two EC-1 isolates despite apparent absence of sequence polymorphisms. 
Among these, silencing of an effector gene was associated with evasion of disease
resistance conferred by a potato immune receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the molecular changes underpinning the
exceptional genetic and phenotypic plasticity associated with host adaptation in 
a pandemic clonal lineage of a eukaryotic plant pathogen. We observed that the
asexual P. infestans lineage EC-1 can exhibit phenotypic plasticity in the
absence of apparent genetic mutations resulting in virulence on a potato carrying
the Rpi-vnt1.1 gene. Such variant alleles may be epialleles that arose through
epigenetic changes in the underlying genes.
