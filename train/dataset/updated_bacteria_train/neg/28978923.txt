Bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most common cancer worldwide. Radical cystectomy
(RC) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is recommended for muscle-invasive BC.
The challenge of the neoadjuvant approach relates to challenges in selection of
patients to chemotherapy that are likely to respond to the treatment. To date,
there are no validated molecular markers or baseline clinical characteristics to 
identify these patients. Different inflammatory markers, including tumor
associated macrophages with their plastic pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic
functions, have extensively been under interests as potential prognostic and
predictive biomarkers in different cancer types. In this immunohistochemical
study we evaluated the predictive roles of three immunological markers, CD68,
MAC387, and CLEVER-1, in response to NAC and outcome of BC. 41% of the patients
had a complete response (pT0N0) to NAC. Basic clinicopathological variables did
not predict response to NAC. In contrast, MAC387+ cells and CLEVER-1+ macrophages
associated with poor NAC response, while CLEVER-1+ vessels associated with more
favourable response to NAC. Higher counts of CLEVER-1+ macrophages associated
with poorer overall survival and CD68+ macrophages seem to have an independent
prognostic value in BC patients treated with NAC. Our findings point out that
CD68, MAC387, and CLEVER-1 may be useful prognostic and predictive markers in BC.
