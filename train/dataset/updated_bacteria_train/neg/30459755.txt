Background: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is a Gram-negative
coccobacillus recognized as a pathogen in periodontitis and infective
endocarditis. By producing a toxin (leukotoxin A, LtxA) that triggers global
hypercitrullination in neutrophils, Aa has been recently linked to rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. Although mechanistic and clinical association
studies implicate Aa infection in the initiation of autoimmunity in RA, direct
evidence in humans is lacking. Case:We describe a 59-year-old man with
anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive RA who presented for
evaluation of refractory disease. He was found to have Aa endocarditis. Following
antibiotic treatment, joint symptoms resolved and ACPAs normalized. Given the
implications for RA immunopathogenesis, we further investigated the bacterial,
genetic and immune factors that may have contributed to the patient's clinical
and autoimmune phenotypes. Methods:DNA was extracted from serum and used to
amplify the Aa leukotoxin (ltx) promoter region by PCR, which was further
analyzed by Sanger sequencing. High-resolution identification of HLA alleles was 
performed by sequenced based typing (SBT). TNF-α, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-21, and IL-22 were quantified in serum by a multiplex
immunoassay. IgG and IgA antibodies to Aa LtxA were assayed by ELISA. Results: Aa
genotyping confirmed infection with a highly leukotoxic strain carrying a 530-bp 
ltx promoter deletion, shown to result in 10- to 20-fold higher bacterial
expression of LtxA. Immuno-phenotyping showed high anti-LtxA antibodies, elevated
cytokines implicated in RA pathogenesis (Th1/Th17), and specific host
susceptibility conferred by three HLA alleles strongly linked to ACPAs and RA
(DRB1*04:04, DRB1*15:01, and DPB1*04:01). One year after eradication of Aa, the
patient remained free of arthritis and anti-CCP antibodies. Conclusion: In the
context of genetic risk for RA, systemic subacute infection with a leukotoxic
strain of Aa can drive ACPA production and a clinical phenotype similar to RA.
