Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells act at the crossroad between innate and adaptive
immunity and are important players in the defense against microbial pathogens.
iNKT cells can detect pathogens that trigger innate receptors (e.g., TLRs, Rig-I,
Dectin-1) within APCs, with the consequential induction of CD1d-mediated Ag
presentation and release of proinflammatory cytokines. We show that the cytosolic
peptidoglycan-sensing receptors Nod1 and Nod2 are necessary for optimal IFN-γ
production by iNKT cells, as well as NK cells. In the absence of Nod1 and Nod2,
iNKT cells had a blunted IFN-γ response following infection by Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. For Gram-negative
bacteria, we reveal a synergy between Nod1/2 and TLR4 in dendritic cells that
potentiates IL-12 production and, ultimately, activates iNKT cells. These
findings suggest that multiple innate pathways can cooperate to regulate iNKT
cell activation during bacterial infection.
