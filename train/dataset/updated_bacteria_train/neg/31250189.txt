RtcB, a highly conserved RNA ligase, is found in all three domains of life, and
demonstrated to be an essential tRNA splicing component in archaea and metazoans.
However, the biological functions of RtcB in bacteria, where there is no
splicing, remains to be clarified. We first performed bioinformatics analysis
which revealed highly conserved structures and presumably conserved functions of 
RtcB in bacteria. However, its orthologs only occur in ∼ 0.5% of bacterial
species across diverse phyla with significant signals of frequent horizontal
transfer, highlighting its non-essential role in bacteria. Next, by constructing 
an rtcB-knockout strain, we find that the removal of antibiotic stress induces a 
significant impact on rtcB expression in wild-type strain, and furthermore the
depletion of RtcB (ARtcB strain) delays the recovery process. Our transcriptomic 
analysis, comprising the 3'-end labeling of RNAs, highlights a significant
increase in unmapped reads and cleaved rRNAs in the Δ RtcB strain, particularly
during recovery. Our observations suggest that the conserved RNA ligase RtcB,
repairs damaged rRNAs following stress, which potentially saves energy and
accelerates recovery of its host. We propose that acquisition of RtcB by diverse 
bacterial taxa provides a competitive advantage under stressful conditions.
