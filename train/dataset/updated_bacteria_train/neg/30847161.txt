LI12542F6, a botanical extract composed of Sphaeranthus indicus and Mangifera
indica, was evaluated for mutagenicity in bacteria, clastogenicity in mouse bone 
marrow, acute oral and dermal toxicity in the rat, irritation (dermal, eye) in
rabbit, and subacute and subchronic toxicity (28 and 90 days) in the rat. All
studies followed standard OECD test protocols, in accordance with the principles 
of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). LI12542F6 did not induce mutations in the
bacterial assay using Salmonella and Escherichia coli strains, nor did it induce 
genotoxic effects in erythrocytes from mouse bone marrow. LI12542F6 was found to 
have oral and dermal LD 50 values greater than the limit dose of 2,000 mg/kg body
weight in the rat. In an eye irritation/corrosion test, LI12542F6 caused
conjunctival redness, corneal opacity, and chemosis and is classified as Category
2A ("irritating to eyes - reversible eye effect"). Doses in the 28-day and 90-day
rat oral toxicity studies were 0, 500, 1,000, and 1,500 and 0, 1,000, 1,500, and 
2,000 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively, administered by gavage. Both studies
featured a recovery period. Minor effects were random and not treatment related
except for local irritation of the forestomach in the 28-day study, evidenced by 
histopathologic examination, in mid- and high-dose animals. The frequency and
severity of these effects were reduced in the recovery group; irritation was not 
found in the forestomach of rats in the 90-day study. The no observed adverse
effect level (NOAEL) was greater than the highest dose tested, that is,
>2,000 mg/kg in the 90-day study. This botanical composition will be marketed
commercially for muscle health as Myotor™.
