The relation between oral microbes of mother and child encompasses several
aspects. It has been shown that a bad periodontal condition is a risk factor for 
low birth weight. The bacterium that is most specifically associated with dental 
caries, Streptococcus mutans, can be transmitted between mother and child; it has
been suggested that the age of colonization with this bacterium is a risk factor 
for caries in the child. Also periodontal bacteria can be transmitted between
mother and child. It remains to be elucidated whether this is an additional risk 
factor for the development of periodontal disease.
