mammalian viruses often use components host's cellular dna replication
machinery carry replication genomes, enables viruses 
to used tools characterizing factors involved cellular dna 
replication. human papillomavirus (hpv) e1 protein essential for
replication virus dna. identify cellular factor that
participates viral dna replication using two-hybrid assay yeast
saccharomyces cerevisiae e1 protein bait. using assay, isolated
inil/hsnf5, component swi/snf complex facilitates transcription by
altering structure chromatin. vitro binding immunoprecipitation
confirmed e1 interacts directly ini1/hsnf5. transient dna-replication
assay revealed hpv dna replication stimulated dose-dependent manner 
by addition ini1/hsnf5, ini1/hsnf5 antisense rna blocks the
replication hpv dna. amino-acid substitution residues conserved
among e1 proteins prevented e1-ini1/hsnf5 interaction reduced dna
replication hpv vivo. results indicate ini1/hsnf5 required 
the efficient replication papillomavirus dna therefore needed, either
alone complex swi/snf complex, mammalian dna replication well.
