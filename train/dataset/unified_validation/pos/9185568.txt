the restriction herpes virus latency mammalian sensory ganglia led a
search tissue-specific regulatory molecules neurons alter
viral gene expression. recently shown pou-domain transcriptional
regulator brn-3.0 abundantly expressed adult trigeminal ganglion. to
begin examine hypothesis brn-3.0 might participate regulation 
of hsv life-cycle, used brn-3.0 pou-domain protein affinity matrix, 
and biochemically screened entire hsv genome sites brn-3.0 binding.
this screen identified several sites form ta/ta n n ta/t, which
significantly include previously identified hsv octamer sequences. all
of selected sites occur <25% hsv genome been
assigned open reading frames, suggesting sites may be

with brn-3.0 sufficiently high affinity directly mediate transcriptional 
activation brn-3.0 alone transfection assays. experiments described
also provide effective general method exhaustive screening large viral 
genomes sub-genomic fragments eukaryotic dna sites interaction
