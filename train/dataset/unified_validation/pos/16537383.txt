reverse transcription retroviral rna genomes produce double-stranded linear 
cdna molecule. host degradation system prevents majority cdna
molecules completing obligatory genomic integration necessary for
pathogenesis. demonstrate human tfiih complex proteins xpb (ercc3)
and xpd (ercc2) play principal role degradation retroviral cdna. dna 
repair-deficient xpb xpd mutant cell lines exhibited increase in
transduction efficiency hiv- moloney murine leukemia virus-based
retroviral vectors. replicating moloney murine leukemia virus viral production
was greater xpb xpd mutant cells xpa mutant cells. quantitative pcr
showed increase total cdna molecules, integrated provirus, 2ltr circles
in xpb xpd mutant cells. presence reverse transcription
inhibitor, hiv cdna appeared stable mutant xpb xpd cells. these
studies implicate nuclear dna repair proteins xpb xpd cellular
defense retroviral infection.
