the m1 protein influenza virus multiple regulatory functions 
infectious cycle, include mediation nuclear export viral
ribonucleoproteins, inhibition viral transcription crucial role virus
assembly budding. known modification m1 protein by
phosphorylation yet-to-be-identified kinases. postulated least
some m1 functions exerted regulated interactions with
cellular components. screen cellular mediators, protein
receptor activated c-kinase (rack 1) identified interaction
with viral m1 protein yeast two hybrid system. physical m1-rack 1 
interaction confirmed glutathione-s-transferase-based coprecipitation
assays diverged m1 proteins avian, swine human influenza virus
strains. conservation suggests m1-rack 1 interaction general 
importance influenza virus infections. rack 1 previously been
identified specifically bind activated form protein kinase c (pkc) 
is assumed anchor kinase membranes vicinity substrates.
since m1 protein becomes phosphorylated influenza virus infection, 
examined pkc could catalyze phosphate transfer. demonstrate that
virion-derived recombinant m1 protein indeed efficiently
phosphorylated purified pkc. moreover, cell extracts, detected m1
phosphorylation activity strongly reduced presence the
pkc-specific inhibitor compound gf109203x. data suggest pkc the
main m1-phosphorylating activity cell. since both, m1 protein pkc 
have shown interact rack 1, suggest m1-rack 1
interaction involved m1 phosphorylation.
