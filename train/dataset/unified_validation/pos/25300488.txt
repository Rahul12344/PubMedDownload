transcription hepatitis b virus (hbv) covalently closed circular dna 
(cccdna) template essential replication. suppressing level and
transcriptional activity cccdna might anti-hbv effect. although cellular 
transcription factors, creb, mediate hbv transcription, been
well described, transcriptional coactivators facilitate process are
incompletely understood. study showed creb-regulated
transcriptional coactivator 1 (crtc1) required hbv transcription and
replication. steady-state levels crtc1 protein elevated in
hbv-positive hepatoma cells liver tissues. ectopic expression crtc1 its
homolog crtc2 crtc3 hepatoma cells stimulated activity pres2/s
promoter hbv, whereas overexpression dominant inactive form crtc1
inhibited hbv transcription. crtc1 interacts creb mutually
required recruitment pres2/s promoter cccdna the
activation hbv transcription. accumulation pregenomic rna (pgrna) and
cccdna observed crtc1 homologs overexpressed, whereas the
levels pgrna, cccdna secreted hbsag diminished crtc1 was
compromised. addition, hbv transactivator protein hbx stabilized crtc1 and
promoted activity hbv transcription. work reveals essential role of
crtc1 coactivator facilitating supporting hbv transcription and
replication.
