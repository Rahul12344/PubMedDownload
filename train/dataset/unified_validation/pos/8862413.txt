we demonstrated functional associations mouse adenovirus type 1 (mav-1)
early region 1a (e1a) protein mouse retinoblastoma protein (prb) and
the mouse prb-related protein, p107. interactions mav-1 e1a mouse prb
or mouse p107 proteins examined infected cell lysates using mouse
embryonic fibroblast cell line infected wild-type mutant mav-1 viruses. 
using polyclonal antibody mav-1 e1a, exogenously added mouse prb mouse
p107 coimmunoprecipitated wild-type, die105 (cr1 delta)-, die106
(cr3 delta)-infected cell lysates. coimmunoprecipitation seen cell
lysates die102 (cr2 delta) pme109, mutant virus produces no
detectable e1a protein due atg ttg point mutation initiator
methionine. introduction mouse prb saos-2 cells resulted flat and
enlarged cell phenotype, whereas cotransfection mouse prb mav-1 e1a
resulted significant reduction flat cells, presumably due e1a binding 
prb. cr1 delta cr2 delta e1a proteins less effective reducing the
number flat, enlarged cells induced prb expression cr3 delta 
or wild-type e1a proteins. reduced ability mutants inactivate prb
relative wild-type e1a correlated reduced ability bind prb in
the vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments. measure p107/mav-1 e1a
complex formation mav-1-infected cells, used mobility shift assays to
examine cell extracts presence p107-containing e2f protein-dna
complexes. mock-, die102-, pme109-infected cell extracts formed a
p107-containing complex, whereas wild-type-infected cell extracts not. thus
the formation p107-e2f complex wild-type- mutant-infected
extracts inversely correlated presence e1a-p107 complexes identified 
in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments. consistent e1a-p107 
complexes forming wild-type mav-1-infected cells.
