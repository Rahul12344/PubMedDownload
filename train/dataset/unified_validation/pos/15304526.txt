the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (car) plays role viral infection,
maintenance junction adhesion complex polarized epithelia, and
modulation cellular growth properties. viral receptor, c-terminus
appears play role indicating major function car tether
the virus cell. contrast, c-terminus known play role in
cellular localization probably significant function car-mediated
adhesion cell growth properties. hypothesized car pdz
(psd-95/disc-large/zo-1) binding motif interacts pdz-domain-containing
proteins modulate cellular phenotype. car modified deleting the
last four amino acids (cardeltagsiv) evaluated cell-cell adhesion in
polarized primary human airway epithelia growth characteristics stably
transfected l-cells. although ablation car pdz-binding motif not
affect adenoviral infection, significant effect cell-cell
adhesion cell growth. expression cardeltagsiv failed increase the
transepithelial resistance polarized epithelia degree wild-type
car failed act growth modulator l-cells. furthermore, provide
evidence three new car interacting partners, including magi-1b, pick1 and
psd-95. car appears interact several distinct pdz-domain-containing
proteins may exert biological function interactions.
