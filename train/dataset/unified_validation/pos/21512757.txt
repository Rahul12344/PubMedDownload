the ul14 protein herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) highly conserved in
herpesvirus family. however, exact function hsv-1 replication
cycle little known. present study, high throughput yeast two-hybrid
system employed screen cellular factors interacting ul14, and
five target candidates yielded: (1) tsc22 domain family protein 3 (tsc22d3);
(2) mediator rna polymerase ii transcription subunit 8 isoform 1(med8); (3)
runt-related transcription factor 3 (runx3); (4) arrestin beta-2 (arrb2); (5)
cereblon (crbn). indirect immunofluorescent assay showed tsc22d3 and
med8 co-localized ul14. co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated ul14 
could immunoprecipitated tsc22d3, suggesting ul14 interacted with
tsc22d3 physiological condition. summary, study opened new
avenues toward delineating function physiological significance ul14
during hsv-1 replication cycle.
