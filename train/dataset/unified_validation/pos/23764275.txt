foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) acute, highly contagious animal disease caused
by fmd virus (fmdv). although fmdv-induced immunosuppression host been
well established, exact molecular mechanism induction very
clear. report identification fmdv vp1 interferon-suppressor 
by interacting soluble resistance-related calcium binding protein (sorcin). 
we found vp1 suppressed tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α sendai virus
(sev)-induced type interferon response hek293t cells, this
suppression could completely abolished knockdown sorcin shrna.
furthermore, overexpression sorcin inhibited type interferon response.
conversely, tnf- sev-induced type interferon response increased sorcin 
knocked down, leading inhibition vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv)
replication. thus, vp1-induced suppression type interferon mediated by
interacting sorcin, protein appears regulate cell response to
viral infections.
