molecular mimicry cytokines cytokine receptors strategy used by
poxviruses herpesviruses modulate host immunity. human cytomegalovirus
(hcmv) ul144 gene, situated ul/b' region viral genome, has
amino-acid sequence similarity members tumour necrosis factor receptor 
superfamily. report ul144 potent activator nfkappab-induced
transcription traf6-dependent manner. nfkappab activation enhances
expression chemokine ccl22 nfkappab responsive elements found 
in promoter. contrast clinical hcmv isolates, extensively passaged 
laboratory strains lack ul/b' region hence encode ul144.
consistent this, infection viruses carry ul/b' causes nfkappab
activation ccl22 expression, phenotype observed after
infections strains lacking ul/b' region. moreover, knockdown ul144,
traf6 nfkappab specific sirna infections ul144-encoding hcmv
prevents activation ccl22 expression normally observed infection
with ul/b' positive hcmv. upregulation ccl22, attracts th2 and
regulatory cells, may help hcmv evade immune surveillance.
