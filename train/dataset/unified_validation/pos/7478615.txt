a function shared adenovirus e1a, papillomavirus e7 sv40 tag
oncoproteins ability interfere normal cell growth interacting
with members retinoblastoma protein family. study, show that
each oncoproteins also bind 921 amino acid tbp-associated
factor-110 (taf-110). significance binding underscored the
observation oncoprotein binds 77 amino acid carboxyl region
of taf-110. case e1a tag, finding consistent their
abilities stimulate transcription initiation, part, known
interactions tbp. clear whether e7 also activate
promoters protein:protein interactions components the
transcription initiation complex, demonstration e7 bind taf-110, 
as well tbp, suggests e7 may modulate expression specific
promoters could contribute pathogenesis human papillomavirus.
