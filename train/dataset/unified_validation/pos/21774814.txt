background: hepatitis delta virus (hdv) considered satellite virus 
the hepatitis b virus. genome consists 1679 nt ssrna molecule a
single orf identified. orf codes unique protein, delta antigen
(hdag). transcription, two forms, small (s-hdag; p24) large (l-hdag;
p27) antigen derived result editing mechanism catalyzed by
cellular adenosine deaminase 1. despite simplicity, little still known
about host factors interact virus rna antigens to
modulate virus replication.
methods: yeast two-hybrid screening human liver cdna library, using the
hepatitis delta virus (hdv) small antigen (s-hdag) bait, performed. blot
overlay co-immunoprecipitation assays used attempt confirm 
interaction hnrnpc s-hdag. sirna knockdown assays hnrnpc performed
to assess effect hdv antigen expression.
results: thirty known proteins identified s-hdag interactors yeast
two-hybrid screening. one identified proteins, hnrnpc, found to
interact s-hdag vitro vivo human liver cells. interaction
of two proteins mediated c-terminal half s-hdag which
contains rna-binding domain (aa 98-195). hdv rna, s-hdag, hnrnpc, also
found co-localize nucleus human liver cells. knockdown hnrnpc
mrna using sirnas resulted marked decreased expression hdv antigens.
conclusions: s-hdag found interact human liver proteins previously
assigned different functional categories. among involved nucleic acid
metabolism, hnrnpc found interact vitro vivo human liver
cells. similar rna viruses, seems plausible hnrnpc may also be
involved hdv replication. however, investigation mandatory to
clarify question.
