the epstein-barr virus (ebv) bamhi-a rightward transcripts (barts) expressed 
in ebv-associated tumors well latently infected b cells vivo 
cultured b-cell lines. one bart family transcripts contains open
reading frame, rpms1, encodes nuclear protein termed rpms. reverse
transcription-pcr analysis revealed bart transcripts splicing
pattern generates rpms1 open reading frame commonly expressed in
ebv-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines also detected hodgkin's disease
tissues. experiments undertaken determine function rpms revealed that
rpms interacts cbf1 components cbf1-associated corepressor
complex. rpms interaction cbf1 demonstrated glutathione
s-transferase (gst) affinity assay ability rpms alter the
intracellular localization mutant cbf1. gal4-rpms fusion protein mediated 
transcriptional repression, suggesting additional interaction rpms and
corepressor proteins. gst affinity assays revealed interaction rpms and
the corepressor sin3a cir. rpms-cir interaction substantiated
in mammalian two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, colocalization experiments.
rpms shown interfere notchic ebna2 activation of
cbf1-containing promoters reporter assays. consistent function,
immunofluorescence assays performed cotransfected cells showed 
colocalization rpms notchic ebna2 intranuclear punctate
speckles. effect rpms notchic function examined muscle
cell differentiation assay rpms found partially reverse
notchic-mediated inhibition differentiation. mechanism rpms action 
examined cotransfection mammalian two-hybrid assays. results revealed 
that rpms blocked relief cbf1-mediated repression interfered skip-cir
interactions. conclude rpms acts negative regulator ebna2 and
notch activity interactions cbf1-associated corepressor
complex.
