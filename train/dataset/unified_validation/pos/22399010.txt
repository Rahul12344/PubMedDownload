l-ficolin, one complement lectins found human serum, novel pattern
recognition molecule specifically bind microbial carbohydrates,
thereby activating lectin complement pathway mounting protective innate
immune response. however, little known role l-ficolin during
viral infections vivo. present study, used mouse model of
influenza virus infection demonstrate administration exogenous
l-ficolin ficolin (fcna - l-ficolin-like molecule mouse) is
protective virus. furthermore, fcna-null mice greatly
increased susceptibility infection influenza virus. moreover, we
found recombinant human l-ficolin inhibited influenza virus entry into
madin-darby canine kidney cells. importantly, l-ficolin recognize and
bind hemagglutinin (ha) neuraminidase (na) glycoproteins different
subtypes influenza virus, interactions competitively
inhibited n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. addition, binding l-ficolin and
fcna may lead activation lectin complement pathway. our
knowledge, first report demonstrating l-ficolin block
influenza virus infections vitro vivo using fcna-knockout mice,
possibly interacting carbohydrates ha na. therefore, these
data may provide new immunotherapeutic strategies based innate immune
molecule l-ficolin influenza virus.
