most poxviruses express multiple proteins containing ankyrin (ank) repeats
accounting large superfamily related unique determinants poxviral
tropism. recently, select members novel family poxvirus proteins 
drawn considerable attention potential roles modulating
intracellular signaling networks viral infection. rabbit-specific
poxvirus, myxoma virus (myxv), encodes four unique ank repeat proteins, termed
m-t5, m148, m149, m150, include carboxy-terminal pranc domain 
which closely resembles cellular protein motif called f-box domain. here,
we show myxv-encoded ank repeat protein, including m-t5, interacts
directly skp1 component host scf ubiquitin ligase complex, and
that binding m-t5 cullin 1 indirect via binding skp1 host 
scf complex. understand significance virus-host protein
interactions, various binding domains m-t5 mapped. n-terminal ank
repeats ii identified important interaction akt,
whereas c-terminal pranc/f-box-like domain essential binding skp1.
we also report m-t5 bind akt host scf complex (via skp1)
simultaneously myxv-infected cells. finally, report m-t5 specifically 
mediates relocalization akt nucleus cytoplasm during
infection wild-type myxv, m-t5 knockout version the
virus. results indicate ank/pranc proteins play critical role in
reprogramming disparate cellular signaling cascades establish new cellular
environment favorable virus replication.
