newcastle disease virus (ndv) fusion (f) protein directs membrane fusion, which
is required virus entry cell-cell fusion. previously shown that
free thiols present cell surface-expressed ndv f protein blocking
the production free thiols thiol-disulfide exchange inhibitors inhibited
the membrane fusion mediated f protein (j virol. 81:2328-2339, 2007).
extending observations, evaluated role overexpression two 
disulfide bond isomerases, protein disulfide isomerase (pdi) erdj5, in
cell-cell fusion mediated ndv glycoproteins. overexpression these
isomerases resulted significantly increased membrane fusion, measured by
syncytium formation content mixing. overexpression isomerases
enhanced production free thiols f protein expressed without
hemagglutination-neuraminidase (hn) protein decreased free thiols f
protein expressed hn protein. evaluating binding of
conformation-sensitive antibodies, found overexpression these
isomerases favored postfusion conformation surface-expressed f protein in
the presence hn protein. results suggest isomerases belonging to
the pdi family catalyze production free thiols f protein, free
thiols f protein facilitate membrane fusion mediated f protein.
