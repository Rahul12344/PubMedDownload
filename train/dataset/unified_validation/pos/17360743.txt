human papillomavirus (hpv) infections squamous epithelium associated
with high-level expression e1circumflexe4 protein productive
phase infection. however, precise mechanisms e1circumflexe4
contributes replication cycle virus poorly understood. here, we
show serine-arginine (sr)-specific protein kinase srpk1 novel
binding partner hpv type 1 (hpv1) e1circumflexe4. map critical residues
within arginine-rich domain hpv1 e1circumflexe4, region known to
facilitate e1circumflexe4 oligomerization, requisite srpk1 binding. 
in vitro kinase assays show srpk1 binding associated phosphorylation
of hpv1 e1circumflexe4 polypeptide modulates autophosphorylation the
kinase. show srpk1 sequestered e4 inclusion bodies terminally 
differentiated cells within hpv1 warts colocalization between
e1circumflexe4 srpk1 dependent additional hpv1 factors. moreover,
we also identify srpk1 binding e1circumflexe4 proteins hpv16 hpv18. our
findings indicate srpk1 binding conserved function e1circumflexe4
proteins diverse virus types. srpk1 influences important biochemical processes
within cell, including nuclear organization rna metabolism. while
phosphorylation hpv1 e4 srpk1 may directly influence hpv1 e4 function
during infectious cycle, modulation sequestration srpk1 by
e1circumflexe4 may affect ability srpk1 phosphorylate cellular
targets, thereby facilitating productive phase hpv replication cycle.
