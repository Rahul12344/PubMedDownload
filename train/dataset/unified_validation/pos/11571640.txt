it recently shown high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) e6
proteins target pdz-domain containing proteins, dlg, mupp-1, magi-1 and
hscrib proteasome-mediated degradation. however, e6 proteins hpv-16 
and hpv-18 (the two common high-risk virus types) differ ability to
target proteins manner correlates malignant potential.
to investigate underlying mechanisms this, mutated hpv-16 and
hpv-18 e6s give protein other's pdz-binding motif. analysis 
mutants shows greater ability hpv-18 e6 bind proteins and
to target degradation indeed due single amino acid difference.
using number assays, show e6 proteins interact specifically with
only one five pdz domains magi-1, first interaction
described particular pdz domain. also show guanylate kinase 
homology domain regions magi-1 downstream amino acid 733 not
required degradation magi-1. finally, series comparative
analyses, show degradation magi-1 occurs different
mechanism used e6 protein induce degradation dlg and
p53.
