background: isolate cellular proteins interacting hepatitis b virus x
protein (hbx), hepg2 cells infected hepatitis b virus (hbv).
results: hbv particles produced culture medium hepg2 cells transfected
with mammalian expression vector containing linear hbv genome, as
assessed commercially available elisa assay. cdna library made from
these cells exposed hbv. yeast two hybrid screening hbx bait,
human guanine nucleotide binding protein beta subunit 5l (gnbeta5) isolated
from cdna library constructed study new hbx-interacting protein.
the hbx-gnbeta5 interaction supported mammalian two hybrid assay.
conclusion: use cdna library constructed hbv-transfected hepg2
cells resulted isolation new cellular proteins interacting with
hbx.
