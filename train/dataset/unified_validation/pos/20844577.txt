influenza viruses (iav) bind sialic-acids cellular surfaces enter
cells using endocytotic routes. evidence process not
occur constitutively requires induction specific cellular signals,
including activation pi3k promotes virus internalization. implies
engagement cellular signaling receptors viral entry. here, present
first indications interplay iav receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks). 
as representative rtk family-members epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) 
and c-met receptor studied. modulation expression activity both
rtks resulted altered uptake iav, showing receptors transmit
entry relevant signals upon virus binding. detailed studies egfr function
revealed virus binding lead clustering lipid-rafts, suggesting that
multivalent binding iav cells induces signaling platform leading to
activation egfr rtks turn facilitates iav uptake.
