human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) regulates nf-kappab infection variety of
mechanisms. example, hcmv gene product, ul144, known activate
nf-kappab tumor necrosis factor receptor (tnfr)-associated factor 6
(traf6)-dependent manner, causing upregulation chemokine ccl22 (mdc). 
viral ul144 expressed ul/b' region hcmv genome early times 
postinfection tnfr1-like homologue. despite homology tnfr1
receptor superfamily, ul144 bind members tnf ligand
superfamily. show upregulation nf-kappab ul144 is
dependent upon cellular tripartite motif 23 (trim23) protein. propose a
mechanism ul144 activates nf-kappab direct interaction with
the cellular protein trim23 complex containing traf6. contrast, trim23 is
not involved conventional double-stranded rna signaling via nf-kappab.
therefore, present novel role trim23 specific ul144-mediated 
activation nf-kappab course virus infection.
