initiation translation genomic rna (grna) hepatitis c virus (hcv) is
provided highly structured fragment 5'-untranslated region, the
so-called internal ribosome entry site (ires). work, exposed
nh2-groups proteins 40s subunit human ribosome binary
complexes rna transcripts corresponding full-size hcv ires its
fragments probed using n-hydroxysuccinimide derivative the
fluorescent dye cy3. comparison efficiencies modification ribosomal
proteins free subunits binary complexes rna transcripts 
revealed ribosomal proteins involved hcv ires binding. found that
binding 40s subunits rna transcript corresponding full-size
hcv ires results decrease modification levels ribosomal protein (rp)
s27 and, lesser extent rps10; also, noticeable decrease the
efficiency labeling proteins rack1/s2/s3a observed. fragment 
hcv ires containing initial part open reading frame (orf) viral
grna deleted, level rps10 modification became free
subunits, whereas levels modification rps27 rack1/s2/s3a group 
remained virtually unchanged compared observed complex 40s
subunit full-size hcv ires. binding 40s subunits fragment the
hcv ires lacking orf domain ii increased modification level the
rack1/s2/s3a proteins, efficiencies labeling rps10 rps27
remained upon deletion orf fragment. comparison these
results known structural biochemical data organization 40s
subunit location hcv ires revealed structural elements of
the ires contacting exposed lysine residues above-mentioned ribosomal
proteins. thus, found majority exposed lysine residues of
rps27 involved binding hcv ires region formed junction
of subdomains iiia, iiib, iiic central stalk domain iii, that
several lysine residues rps10 participate binding hcv ires
region corresponding initial part orf viral grna. in
addition, concluded lysine residues rps3a involved binding 
of domains ii iii hcv ires.
