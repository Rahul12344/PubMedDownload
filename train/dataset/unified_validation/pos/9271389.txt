the human host cell factor (hcf) expressed variety adult fetal
tissues, gene conserved animals diverse mammals insects. 
however, known function stabilize herpes simplex virus virion 
transactivator vp16 complex cellular pou domain protein oct-1 and
cis-acting regulatory elements promoters immediate-early viral genes. to
identify cellular function hcf, used yeast two-hybrid system to
identify cellular ligand hcf. protein, luman, appears cyclic
amp response element (cre)-binding protein/activating transcription factor 1
protein basic leucine zipper superfamily. binds cres vitro and
activates cre-containing promoters transfected cos7 cells. this
activation transcription synergistically enhanced presence of
ccaat/enhancer-binding protein elements inhibited ap-1 elements the
promoter. addition basic dna binding domain, luman possesses unusually
long leucine zipper acidic amino-terminal activation domain. these
features luman also present appear homologs mouse,
drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans. luman vp16 appear to
have similar mechanisms binding hcf, vitro competitively inhibited
the binding hcf. transfected cells, however, vp16
strongly inhibited ability gal-luman activate transcription gal4
upstream activation sequence-containing promoter, luman unable inhibit the
activity gal-vp16. luman appears ubiquitous transcription factor, 
its mrna detected human adult fetal tissues examined. possible
role hcf regulating function ubiquitous transcription factor is
discussed.
