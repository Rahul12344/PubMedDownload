the 86-kda immediate-early 2 (ie2) protein human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) a
promiscuous transactivator essential viral gene expression. ie2 covalently
modified sumo two lysine residues (k175 k180) also interacts
noncovalently sumo. although sumoylation ie2 shown enhance
its transactivation activity, role sumo binding clear. we
showed sumo binding ie2 necessary efficient transactivation
function viral growth. ie2 bound physically sumo-1 a
sumo-interacting motif (sim). mutations sim (msim) sumoylation
sites sim (kr/msim), significantly reduced ie2 transactivation effects on
viral early promoters. replication ie2 sim mutant viruses (msim or
kr/msim) severely depressed normal human fibroblasts. analysis viral
growth curves revealed replication defect msim virus correlated
with low-level accumulation sumo-modified ie2 viral early late
proteins. importantly, formation viral transcription domains 
association ie2 viral promoters infected cells significantly
reduced ie2 sim mutant virus infection. furthermore, ie2 found interact
with sumo-modified form tata-binding protein (tbp)-associated factor 12
(taf12), component tfiid complex, sim-dependent manner, this
interaction enhanced transactivation activity ie2. data demonstrate
that interaction ie2 sumo-modified proteins plays important role
for progression hcmv lytic cycle, suggest novel viral
mechanism utilizing cellular sumo system.
