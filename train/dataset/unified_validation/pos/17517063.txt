the host-virus interactions leading cell infection hepatitis c virus
(hcv) fully understood. tetraspanin cd-81 human scavenger
receptor sr-bi/cla1 major receptors mediating virus cell entry. however, hcv 
in patients' sera associated lipoproteins infectious potential the
virus depends lipoproteins associated virus particles. show that
lipoprotein lipase (lpl), targeting triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (trl) the
liver, mediates binding internalization hcv different types cells,
acting bridge virus-associated lipoproteins cell surface heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (hspg). dimeric structure catalytic activity lpl
are required lpl-mediated hcv uptake cells. unexpectedly, exogenous lpl
significantly inhibits hcvcc infection vitro. effect prevented by
anti-lpl antibodies tetrahydrolipstatin (thl) specific inhibitor lpl 
enzymatic activity. addition, show antibodies directed to
apolipoprotein b (apob)-containing lipoproteins efficiently inhibits hcvcc
infection. findings suggest lpl mediates hcv cell entry mechanism
similar hepatic clearance trl circulation, promoting a
non-productive virus uptake. data provide new insight mechanisms of
hcv cell entry suggest lpl could modulate hcv infectivity vivo.
