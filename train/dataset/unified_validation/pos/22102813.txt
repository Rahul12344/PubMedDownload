herpesviruses evolved numerous immune evasion strategies facilitate
establishment lifelong persistent infections. many herpesviruses encode gene
products devoted preventing viral antigen presentation means escaping 
detection cytotoxic lymphocytes. human herpesvirus-7 (hhv-7) u21 gene
product, example, immunoevasin binds class major
histocompatibility complex molecules redirects lysosomal
compartment. virus infection also induce upregulation surface ligands 
that activate nk cells. accordingly, herpesviruses evolved diverse
array mechanisms prevent nk cell engagement nk-activating ligands on
virus-infected cells. demonstrate hhv-7 u21 gene product
interferes nk recognition. u21 bind nk activating ligand ulbp1
and reroute lysosomal compartment. addition, u21 downregulates the
surface expression nk activating ligands mica micb, resulting a
reduction nk-mediated cytotoxicity. results suggest single
viral protein may interfere ctl-mediated recognition the
downregulation class mhc molecules well nk-mediated recognition
through downregulation nk activating ligands.
