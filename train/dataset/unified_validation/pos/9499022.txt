the hepatitis b virus mammalian hepadnavirus genomes encode short
open reading frame called x. expression protein product (hbx) appears
necessary establishment natural infection. however, vitro studies 
suggested multifunctional role hbx indirect transcriptional
transactivator variety different viral cellular promoters. indeed,
hbx known direct dna binding properties may interact with
transcription factors well activate intracellular signaling pathways
associated cell growth. address possible functional role of
hbx life cycle hepatitis b virus, performed analysis using the
yeast two-hybrid system screen cdna library derived hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line hbx fusion bait attempt identify cellular
partners may bind alter biologic properties hbx. a
hbx-interacting protein specifically complexes carboxy terminus 
wild-type hbx identified designated xip. 9.6-kda protein capable 
of binding hbx vitro, transient stable expression hepatocellular
carcinoma cells abolishes transactivation properties hbx luciferase
constructs driven ap-1 endogenous hepatitis b virus enhancer/promoter
elements. investigation role xip hepatitis b virus replication in
differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma cells revealed xip expression
reduces wild-type hepatitis b virus replication levels observed following
transfection hbx-minus virus. contrast, replication levels 
duck hepatitis b virus, hepadnavirus lacks x open reading frame, 
unchanged context xip expression. propose one the
physiologic functions cellular protein xip negatively regulate hbx
activity thus alter replication life cycle virus.
