more 120 human papillomaviruses (hpvs) identified have
been associated variety clinical lesions. understand molecular
differences among viruses result lesions distinct pathologies,
we begun ms-based proteomic analysis hpv-host cellular protein
interactions created plasmid cell line libraries required for
these studies. validate system, characterized host cellular
proteins bind e7 proteins expressed 17 different hpv types.
these studies reveal number interactions, conserved across
hpv types others unique single hpv species hpv genus.
binding e7 ubr4/p600 conserved across virus types, whereas the
cellular protein enc1 binds specifically e7s hpv18 hpv45, both
members genus alpha, species 7. identify specific interaction hpv16 e7
with zer1, substrate specificity factor cullin 2 (cul2)-ring ubiquitin
ligase, show zer1 required binding hpv16 e7 cul2. we
further show zer1 required destabilization retinoblastoma 
tumor suppressor rb1 hpv16 e7-expressing cells propose cul2-zer1
complex functions target rb1 degradation hpv16 e7-expressing cells.
these studies refine current understanding hpv e7 functions establish 
a platform rapid identification virus-host interactions.
