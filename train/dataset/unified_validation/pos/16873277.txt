cytoplasmic dynein,together cofactor dynactin, transports incoming
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) capsids along microtubules (mt) the
mt-organizing center (mtoc). mtoc, capsids move nuclear
pore, viral genome released nucleoplasm. small capsid
protein vp26 interact dynein light chains tctex1 (dynlt1) rp3
(dynlt3) may recruit dynein capsid. therefore, analyzed nuclear
targeting incoming hsv1-deltavp26 capsids devoid vp26 hsv1-gfpvp26
capsids expressing gfpvp26 fusion instead vp26. compare cell entry of
different strains, characterized inocula respect infectivity,
viral genome content, protein composition, particle composition. preparations
with low particle-to-pfu ratio showed efficient nuclear targeting were
considered higher quality containing many defective
particles, unable induce plaque formation. cells infected
with hsv-1 wild type, hsv1-deltavp26, hsv1-gfpvp26, viral capsids were
transported along mt nucleus. moreover, dynein function inhibited
by overexpression dynactin subunit dynamitin, fewer capsids hsv-1 wild 
type, hsv1-deltavp26, hsv1-gfpvp26 arrived nucleus. thus, even 
absence potential viral dynein receptor vp26, hsv-1 used mt dynein for
efficient nuclear targeting. data suggest besides vp26, hsv-1 encodes 
other receptors dynein dynactin.
