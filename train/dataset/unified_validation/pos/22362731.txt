coronaviruses rna synthesis occurs cytoplasm regulated host cell
proteins. screen based yeast three-hybrid system using the
5'-untranslated region (5'-utr) sars coronavirus (sars-cov) rna bait
against human cdna library derived hela cells, found positive
candidate cellular protein, zinc finger cchc-type rna-binding motif 1
(madp1), able interact region sars-cov genome. this
interaction subsequently confirmed coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus
(ibv). specificity interaction madp1 5'-utr ibv was
investigated confirmed using rna pull-down assay. rna-binding
domain mapped n-terminal region madp1 protein binding
sequence stem-loop ibv 5'-utr. madp1 found translocated 
cytoplasm partially co-localized viral replicase/transcriptase
complexes (rtcs) ibv-infected cells, deviating usual nuclear
localization normal cell using indirect immunofluorescence. using small
interfering rna (sirna) madp1, defective viral rna synthesis observed
in knockdown cells, therefore indicating importance protein in
coronaviral rna synthesis.
