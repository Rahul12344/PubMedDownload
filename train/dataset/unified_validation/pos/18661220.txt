human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causative agent adult t-cell 
leukemia. htlv-1 tax1 transforming protein interacts several pdz
domain-containing proteins, interaction associated the
transforming activities tax1 well persistent htlv-1 infection. this
study, show tax1 interacts tumor suppressor scribble containing 
pdz domains. unlike tax1-interacting pdz domain proteins, pdz
domain-binding motif (pbm) tax1 required interaction with
transiently expressed scribble 293t cells, essential the
interaction endogenous scribble. endogenous scribble 293t cells was
primarily localized plasma membrane colocalized tax1 not
tax1c lacking pbm, whereas transiently expressed scribble localized the
cytoplasm colocalized tax1c well tax1, thus suggesting tax1
is recruited site endogenous scribble, plasma membrane, 
a pbm-dependent manner, thereafter interacts scribble a
pbm-independent pbm-dependent manner. endogenous scribble diffusely
localized plasma membrane htlv-1-uninfected t-cell lines, whereas it
colocalized tax1 small large aggregate plasma membranes. these
results suggest tax1 two binding sites induce aberrant clustering of
scribble, thereby altering functions htlv-1-infected cells, may thus
play role persistent htlv-1 infection pathogenesis.
