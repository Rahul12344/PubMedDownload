a precise mapping pathogen-host interactions essential comprehensive
understanding processes infection pathogenesis. frequently
used techniques interactomics yeast two-hybrid binary methodologies, 
which recapitulate pathogen life cycle, tandem affinity
purification mass spectrometry co-complex methodologies, cannot distinguish
direct indirect interactions. new technologies thus needed improve
the mapping pathogen-host interactions. current study, detected
binary interactions influenza virus polymerase host proteins during
the course actual viral infection, using new strategy based on
trans-complementation gluc1 gluc2 fragments gaussia princeps
luciferase. infectious recombinant influenza viruses encode gluc1-tagged
polymerase subunit engineered infect cultured cells transiently
expressing selected set gluc2-tagged cellular proteins involved in
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways. random set literature-curated set
of gluc2-tagged cellular proteins tested parallel. assay allowed 
sensitive accurate recovery previously described interactions, it
revealed 30% positive, novel viral-host protein-protein interactions within
the exploratory set. addition cellular proteins involved nuclear
import pathway, components nuclear pore complex nup62 mrna
export factors nxf1, rmb15b, ddx19b identified first
time interactors viral polymerase. gene silencing experiments further
showed nup62 required efficient viral replication. findings give 
new insights regarding subversion host nucleocytoplasmic trafficking
pathways influenza viruses. also demonstrate potential our
infectious protein complementation assay high-throughput exploration of
influenza virus interactomics infected cells. infectious reverse
genetics systems becoming available, strategy widely applicable to
numerous pathogens.
