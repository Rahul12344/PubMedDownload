the herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1)-encoded icp22 protein plays important role 
in viral infection affects expression host cell genes. icp22 known to
reduce global level serine (ser)2 phosphorylation the
tyr1ser2pro3thr4ser5pro6ser7 heptapeptide repeats comprising carboxy-terminal
domain (ctd) large subunit rna polymerase (pol) ii. accordingly, icp22 
is thought associate inhibit activity the
positive-transcription elongation factor b (p-tefb) pol ii ctd ser2 kinase. we
show icp22 causes loss ctd ser2 phosphorylation pol ii engaged 
in transcription protein-coding genes following ectopic expression hela
cells recombinant icp22 interacts cdk9 subunit recombinant
p-tefb. icp22 also interacts pol ii vitro. residues 193 256 icp22
are sufficient interaction cdk9 inhibition pol ii ctd ser2
phosphorylation interact pol ii. results indicate that
discrete regions icp22 interact either cdk9 pol ii icp22
interacts directly cdk9 inhibit expression host cell genes.
