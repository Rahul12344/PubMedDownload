ligand activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma)
has reported induce growth inhibition apoptosis various cancers
including hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). however, effect hepatitis b
virus x protein (hbx) ppargamma activation characterized in
hepatitis b virus (hbv)-associated hcc. herein, demonstrated hbx
counteracted growth inhibition caused ppargamma ligand hbx-associated hcc
cells. found hbx bound dna binding domain ppargamma and
hbx/ppargamma interaction blocked nuclear localization binding recognition
site ppargamma. hbx significantly suppressed ppargamma-mediated
transactivation. results suggest hbx modulates ppargamma function
through protein-protein interaction.
