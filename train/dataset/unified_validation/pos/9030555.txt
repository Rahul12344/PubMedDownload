we previously shown parathyroid hormone-related protein (pthrp)
promoter contains binding sites transcription factors ets1 sp1 that
human t-cell lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i) tax cooperates ets1 to
transactivate pthrp p2 promoter. using yeast two-hybrid interaction
system, provide evidence tax interacts ets1. moreover, double 
mutation (d22a,c23s) tax protein abrogated tax/ets1 interaction
also inhibited tax/ets1 cooperative effect, suggesting interaction
between tax ets1 important transactivation pthrp promoter. in
coimmunoprecipitation assays, find tax facilitates interaction
between ets1 sp1, forming ternary complex. sp1 site pthrp
promoter mutated, tax/ets1 cooperative effect dramatically decreased.
this suggests sp1 plays important role ets1-dependent tax
transactivation pthrp p2 promoter. finally, demonstrate gal4-tax
is strong activator gal pthrp promoter, implying tax contributes
directly transcriptional activation promoter. propose model in
which tax/ets1 cooperative effect pthrp p2 promoter based the
ability tax, ets1, sp1 form ternary complex template dna. tax 
facilitates interaction ets1/sp1 participates directly the
transcription initiation process.
