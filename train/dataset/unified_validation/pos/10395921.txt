the hepatitis b virus (hbv) enhancer contains multiple active elements, one of
which ep element, 15 bp site important regulation acting on
other functional elements like e site. ep element, hbv enhancer
context, contains two putative binding sites c-myb family gene products.
electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed minimal c-myb dna-binding
domain binds ep sequence. dnase footprinting experiments revealed that
only one consensus binding site effectively protected. found c-myb
down-regulates transcription driving hbv enhancer cat assays performed 
in haematopoietic (k562) hepatic (hepg2) cell line. interestingly,
co-expression c-myb nf-m, c/ebpbeta homologue recognises 
e element hbv enhancer, showed synergistic transactivation hbv
enhancer while, separately, inhibitory effect on
transcription hepg2 k562 cell lines, two cell types potentially infected
by hepatitis b virus.
