herpesviruses cytomegaloviruses encode functions modulate innate
response diverse ways counteract host sensing delay host clearance
during infection. murine cytomegalovirus m45 protein interacts with
receptor-interacting protein (rip) 1 rip3 via rip homotypic interaction
motif. cell death suppression m45 requires rip homotypic interaction
motif-dependent interaction rip1. interaction also underlies cell
tropism role m45 preventing premature death endothelial cells during
murine cytomegalovirus infection. thus, m45 viral inhibitor rip
activation provides direct cell type-dependent replication benefit 
virus modulating biological processes signaling via rip1 adaptor 
such activation toll-like receptor (tlr)3 well mediators of
cell death.
