double-stranded rnas suppress expression homologous genes an
evolutionarily conserved process called rna interference (rnai) or
post-transcriptional gene silencing. bidentate nuclease called dicer been
implicated protein responsible production short interfering
rnas (sirnas). experiments, rex overexpression reduced efficiency of
short hairpin rna (shrna)-mediated rnai. interaction dicer rex
inhibited conversion shrna sirna. results suggest the
interaction dicer htlv-i rex inhibits dicer activity thereby reduces 
the efficiency conversion shrna sirna.
