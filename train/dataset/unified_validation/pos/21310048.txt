background: cellular transmembrane protein cd317/bst-2/hm1.24/tetherin
restricts hiv-1 infection physically tethering mature virions surface
of infected cells. hiv-1 counteracts restriction expressing accessory
protein vpu, yet mechanism antagonism incompletely understood.
β-trcp substrate recognition domain e3 ubiquitin ligase complex that
interacts di-serine motif s52/s56 cytoplasmic tail vpu to
target cd4 receptor proteasomal degradation. recently, been
suggested β-trcp also critically involved vpu's ability overcome
the cd317-mediated virion release block.
results: test model, analyzed consequences several experimental
strategies interfere vpu-β-trcp protein-protein interaction. under
these conditions, studied effects vpu expression localization of
cd317 cd4, well ability promote hiv-1 release. results
demonstrate strict requirement vpu's di-serine motif degradation cd4
and also cd317, reduction cell surface exposure cd317, hiv-1 release
enhancement. show critical role β-trcp2, the
structurally related β-trcp1 isoform, vpu-mediated degradation both
receptors. importantly, vpu remained active downregulating cd317 the
cell surface overcoming hiv-1 release restriction β-trcp-depleted
cells.
conclusions: results demonstrate β-trcp strictly required for
vpu's ability counteract cd317-imposed virion release block support
the relevance cell surface down-modulation restriction factor a
central mechanism vpu antagonism. moreover, propose existence a
critical, yet identified cellular factor interacts vpu via its
di-serine motif alter trafficking restriction factor.
