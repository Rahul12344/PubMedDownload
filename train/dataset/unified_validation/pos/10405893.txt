background: chronic hepatitis resulting hepatitis c virus (hcv)
infection leads cirrhosis least half infected patients increases
the risk hepatocellular carcinoma. indications pathogenic 
effect may result disturbance intracellular signal cascades caused by
the interaction viral antigens. although great amount data been
accumulated functional regions hcv proteins, relatively little known 
about intracellular targets. previously, demonstrated the
full-length non-structural protein 3 hcv (ns3) (borowski p, heiland m, feucht 
h, laufs r. characterisation non-structural protein 3 hepatitis c virus 
modulator protein phosphorylation mediated pka pkc. evidences for

the changes properties histones substrate camp-dependent protein
kinase (pka) protein kinase c (pkc) found direct consequence the
interaction.
objective: present study observations, localize the
histone binding domain ns3 investigate mechanisms ns3 affects
the functions histones vitro.
study design: hcv protein exhibiting mentioned histone binding activity was
produced bacterial expression system, purified binding histones was
biochemically characterized. region ns3 involved interaction with
histones defined proteolytic fragmentation, microsequencing specific
histone binding assay. furthermore, functional test quantify interaction
of histones dna established binding dna histone a
function ns3 concentration analysed means graphical methods.
results: investigated fragment hcv polyprotein consisting amino acid
residues 1189-1525 (hcv-polyprotein-(1189-1525)) displayed significant histone
binding activity. binding occurred molar ratio 1:1 histone to
hcv-polyprotein-(1189-1525) mediated linear stretch amino acids
located residues 1343 1379 hcv polyprotein. demonstrate
that hcv-polyprotein-(1189-1525) affects binding dna histones used
two independent methods: overlay assay binding assay sepharose beads.
graphic analysis binding kinetics revealed uncompetitive type of
inhibition.
conclusions: results provide first evidence ns3 binds affects
the functions core histones. mechanism ns3 interferes with
the histone functions involves conformational changes histone molecule.
