in primate cells, assembly single hiv-1 capsid involves multimerization of
thousands gag polypeptides, typically plasma membrane. although studies
support model hiv-1 assembly proceeds complexes containing gag
and cellular adenosine triphosphatase abce1 (also termed hp68 ribonuclease
l inhibitor), whether complexes constitute true assembly intermediates
remains controversial. demonstrate pulse labeling primate cells
that population gag associates endogenous abce1 within minutes of
translation. next approximately 2 h, gag-abce1 complexes increase size 
to approximately immature capsids. dissociation abce1 gag
correlates closely gag processing virion maturation occurs much
less efficiently hiv-1 protease inactivated. finally, quantitative
double-label immunogold electron microscopy reveals abce1 recruited to
sites assembling wild-type gag plasma membrane sites an
assembly-defective gag mutant plasma membrane. together findings
demonstrate population gag present plasma membrane sites assembly
associates abce1 throughout capsid formation onset virus
maturation, followed virus release. moreover, data suggest a
linkage gag-abce1 dissociation subsequent events virion
production.
