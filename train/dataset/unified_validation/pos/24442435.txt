ribavirin proven key component hepatitis c therapies both
involving ifns new direct-acting antivirals. hepatitis c virus-mediated
interference intrahepatic immunity cleavage mitochondrial antiviral
signaling protein (mavs) cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (tcptp) suggests
an avenue compounds may counteract effects. therefore studied
the effects ribavirin, without inhibition nonstructural
(ns)3/4a protease, intrahepatic immunity. intrahepatic immunity of
wild-type ns3/4a-transgenic mice determined western blot, elisa, flow 
cytometry, survival analysis. various mavs tcptp constructs injected 
hydrodynamically study relevance. ribavirin pretreatment performed
in mice expressing functional inhibited ns3/4a protease analyze its
effect ns3/4a-mediated changes. intrahepatic ns3/4a expression made mice
resistant tnf-α-induced liver damage caused alteration the
intrahepatic cytokine (ifn-γ il-10) chemokine (ccl3, ccl17, ccl22, cxcl9,
and cxcl11) profiles toward anti-inflammatory state. consistent this, the
number intrahepatic th1 cells ifn-γ(+) cells ns3/4a-transgenic mice
decreased, whereas amount th2 cells increased. effects could be
reversed injection uncleavable tcptp uncleavable mavs were
absent mouse expressing nonfunctional ns3/4a protease. importantly, the
ns3/4a-mediated effects reversed ribavirin treatment. thus, cleavage of
tcptp ns3/4a induces shift intrahepatic immune response toward a
nonantiviral th2-dominated immunity. effects reversed ribavirin,
supporting ribavirin complements effects direct-acting antivirals 
an immunomodulatory compound.
