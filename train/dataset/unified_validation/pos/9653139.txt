we previously shown degradation c-myc n-myc vitro is
mediated ubiquitin system. however, role system targeting
the myc proteins vivo identity conjugating enzymes possible
ancillary proteins involved remained obscure. report the
degradation myc proteins cells inhibited lactacystin mg132,
two inhibitors 20s proteasome. inhibition accompanied accumulation
of myc-ubiquitin conjugates. dissection ancillary proteins involved
revealed high-risk human papillomavirus oncoprotein e6-16 stimulates
conjugation subsequent degradation myc proteins vitro. expression
of e6-16 cells results significant shortening t1/2 myc
proteins subsequent decrease cellular level. analysis the
conjugating enzymes revealed basal conditions proteins be
conjugated two pairs e2s e3s-e2-14 kda e3alpha involved the
"n-end rule" pathway, e2-f1 (ubch7) e3-fos involved also conjugation
of c-fos. presence e6-16, third pair, e2-f1 e6-ap mediate
conjugation myc means mechanism appears similar that
involved targeting p53, formation myc. e6.e6-ap targeting complex.
it possible certain cells e6-mediated targeting myc prevents
myc-induced apoptosis thus ensures maintenance viral infection.
