the origin recognition complex (orc) important function determining the
initiation sites dna replication. higher eukaryotes, orc lacks
sequence-specific dna binding, mechanisms orc recruitment origin
determination poorly understood. orc recruited high efficiency the
epstein-barr virus origin plasmid replication (orip) complex
mechanism involving interactions virus-encoded ebna1 protein. present
evidence orc recruitment orip dna replication function depends on
rgg-like motifs, referred lr1 lr2, ebna1 amino-terminal domain. 
moreover, show lr1 lr2 recruitment orc rna dependent. hmga1a,
which functionally substitute lr1 lr2 domain, also recruit orc in
an rna-dependent manner. ebna1 hmga1a rgg motifs bound structured g-rich
rna, orc1 peptides, interact ebna1. rnase treatment of
cellular chromatin released fraction total orc, suggesting orc
association chromatin, possibly cellular origins, stabilized rna. 
we propose structural rna molecules mediate orc recruitment cellular
and viral origins, similar orip.
