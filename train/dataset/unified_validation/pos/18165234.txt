ns1 (nonstructural protein 1) important virulence factor influenza a
virus. observed ns1 proteins 1918 pandemic virus (a/brevig
mission/1/18) many avian influenza viruses contain consensus src homology
3 (sh3) domain-binding motif. screening comprehensive human sh3 phage
library revealed n-terminal sh3 crk crkl preferred binding
partners. studies recombinant proteins confirmed avid binding ns1
proteins 1918 virus representative avian h7n3 strain crk/crkl sh3
but sh3 domains tested, including p85alpha p85beta. endogenous
crkl readily co-precipitated ns1 cells infected h7n3 virus. in
transfected cells association crkl observed ns1 1918 h7n3
viruses a/udorn/72 a/wsn/33 ns1 lacking sequence motif. sh3
binding dispensable suppression interferon-induced gene expression 
ns1 associated enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, 
evidenced increased akt phosphorylation. thus, spanish flu virus resembles
avian influenza viruses ability recruit crk/crkl modulate host
cell signaling.
