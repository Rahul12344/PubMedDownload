in work shown astrovirus infection induces apoptosis caco-2 
cells, since fragmentation cellular dna, cleavage cellular proteins which
are substrate activated caspases, change mitochondrial
transmembrane potential occur upon virus infection. human astrovirus yuc8
polyprotein capsid precursor vp90 initially processed yield vp70, we
have shown processing trypsin independent occurs intracellularly
through four cleavages carboxy-terminal region. showed that
vp90-vp70 processing mediated caspases, since blocked the
pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-val-ala-asp fluoromethylketone
(z-vad-fmk), promoted apoptosis inducer tnf-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail). although cell-associated virus produced in
the presence compounds affected, release infectious virus
to cell supernatant drastically reduced presence z-vad-fmk 
increased trail, indicating vp90-vp70 cleavage important virus
particles released cell. first report describes
the induction utilization caspase activity virus promote
processing capsid precursor dissemination viral particles.
