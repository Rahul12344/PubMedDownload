rnasel 2-5a-dependent endoribonuclease component the
interferon-induced 2-5a system, plays crucial role antiviral and
apoptotic activities interferons. humans, many polymorphic sites within the
rnasel gene associated increased risk developing prostate
cancer. here, obtained coding sequences rnasel gene 11 primates
and found evidence positive selection operated c-terminal
endoribonuclease domain n-terminal ankyrin repeats domain protein,
domains directly interact virus (i.e., ankyrin repeats responsible 
for receiving environmental signals, endoribonuclease catalyses the
destruction pathogenic viral rna). extend finding, studied
variation within gene modern human populations resequencing alleles
from 144 individuals representing four separate populations. interestingly, the
frequency 541d allele shows negative association incidence rate
of prostate cancer worldwide populations, haplotypes containing 541d
polymorphisms demonstrate signatures positive selection. rnasel variants
having 541d haplotype likely greater ability defend against
infections viruses, thus loss activity may associated 
development prostate cancer. provide evidence positive selection has
operated rnasel gene, evolution correlated function in
pathogen defense cancer association.
