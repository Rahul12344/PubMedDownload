simian virus 40 large antigen (t ag) capable immortalizing and
transforming rodent cells. transforming activity ag due large part
to perturbation tumor suppressor proteins p53 retinoblastoma (prb)
family members. inactivation tumor suppressors may sufficient for
t ag-mediated cellular transformation. shown ag associates
with scf-like complex contains member cullin family e3
ubiquitin ligases, cul7, well skp1, rbx1, f-box protein, fbxw8. we
identified ag residues 69 83 required ag binding cul7
complex. demonstrate delta69-83 ag, lost ability to
associate cul7, retained binding p53 prb family members. the
presence cul7, wild-type (wt) ag delta69-83 ag able induce 
proliferation mouse embryo fibroblasts, indication cellular
transformation. contrast, wt delta69-83 ag enabled mouse embryo
fibroblasts proliferate similarly high densities absence cul7.
our data suggest that, addition p53 prb family members, ag serves
to bind inactivate growth-suppressing properties cul7. addition,
these results imply that, least presence ag, cul7 may function 
a tumor suppressor.
