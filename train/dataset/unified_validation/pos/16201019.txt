herpes simplex virus (hsv) number genes devoted immune evasion. one
such gene, icp47, binds transporter associated antigen presentation
(tap) 1/2 thereby preventing transport viral peptides endoplasmic
reticulum, loading peptides onto nascent major histocompatibility complex
(mhc) class molecules, presentation peptides cd8 cells. however,
icp47 binds poorly murine tap1/2 inhibits antigen presentation mhc
class mice much less efficiently humans, limiting utility of
murine models address importance mhc class inhibition hsv
immunopathogenesis. address limitation, generated recombinant hsvs
that efficiently inhibit antigen presentation murine mhc class i. these
recombinant viruses prevented cytotoxic lymphocyte killing infected cells in
vitro, replicated higher titers central nervous system, induced
paralysis frequently control hsv. increase virulence due to
inhibition antigen presentation cd8 cells, since differences were
not evident mhc class i-deficient mice mice cd8 cells were
depleted. inhibition mhc class recombinant viruses impair the
induction hsv-specific cd8 t-cell response, indicating that
cross-presentation principal mechanism hsv-specific cd8 cells
are induced. inhibition turn facilitates greater viral entry,
replication, and/or survival central nervous system, leading an
increased incidence paralysis.
