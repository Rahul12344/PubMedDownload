in cells infected kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv),
csl/cbf1 signaling essential viral replication promotes survival
of kshv-infected cells. csl/cbf1 dna adaptor molecule recruits
coactivator corepressor complexes regulate viral cellular gene
transcription major downstream effector molecule activated
notch. interaction kshv rta lana csl/cbf1 shown to
balance lytic latent viral life cycle. report third kshv
protein, viral interferon regulatory factor 4 (virf4/k10), none three 
other kshv-encoded virfs, interacts csl/cbf1. two regions virf4 with
dissimilar affinities contribute csl/cbf1 binding. similar notch, virf4
targets hydrophobic pocket beta trefoil domain csl/cbf1 a
short peptide motif closely resembles motif found notch not
strictly follow φwφp consensus conserved human mouse notch proteins.
our results suggest virf4 might compete notch csl/cbf1 binding 
signaling.
