hbx, transcriptional transactivating protein hepatitis b virus (hbv), is
required viral infection implicated virus-mediated liver
oncogenesis. however, molecular mechanism influence cell remains
largely unknown. proved hbx need help host cell proteins to
exert function binding them. purifying gstx (fusion protein
of gst hbx) expressed e. coli, found bind specifically with
grpe (hsp60) dnak (hsp70) e. coli gst cannot. using gst pull-down,
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrum, found gstx can
also bind human mitochondrial hsp60 hsp70, homologues grpe
and dnak. interactions hbx mitochondrial hsp60 hsp70 are
supported result co-immunoprecipitation experiment. means hbx
can form complex e. coli human hsp60 hsp70. implication hbx, 
hsp60 hsp70 complex molecular mechanism virus infection discussed.
