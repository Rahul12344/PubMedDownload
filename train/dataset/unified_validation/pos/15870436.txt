background: kaposi sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus (kshv) encodes k-cyclin, 
a homologue d-type cellular cyclins, binds cyclin-dependent kinases to
phosphorylate various substrates. k-cyclin/cdk phosphorylates subset of
substrates normally targeted cyclins d, e, a. used cells naturally
infected kshv characterize biochemical features k-cyclin.
methods: used immunoprecipitation k-cyclin antibodies examine the
association k-cyclin cdk2, cdk6, p21cip1, p27kip1 proteins bc3
cells. separated populations bc3 cells enriched cells g1, s, g2/m 
phases elutriation measured k-cyclin protein kinase activity of
k-cyclin/cdk6 complexes. half-life k-cyclin cyclin d2 proteins was
determined blocking protein synthesis cycloheximide measuring
proteins cell lysates western blot analysis. fused entire k-cyclin
sequence carboxyl-terminal sequence cellular cyclin contains the
pest degradation sequence produce k-cyclin/d2 transfected k-cyclin/d2 into
k-cyclin-negative cells investigate effect pest sequence on
k-cyclin's stability.
results: viral k-cyclin interacted cyclin-dependent kinases cdk2, cdk4, 
cdk6 cyclin/cdk inhibitory proteins p21cip1 p27kip1 bc3 cell 
lysates. unlike d-type cyclins, whose expression cell cycle dependent, the
level k-cyclin stable throughout cell cycle, kinase associated
with k-cyclin/cdk6 complex constitutively active. half-life of
k-cyclin (6.9 hours) much longer cellular cyclin d2 (0.6 hour)
and k-cyclin/d2 (0.5 hour), probably k-cyclin lacks pest
degradation sequence present d-type cyclins.
conclusion: constitutive activation k-cyclin/cdk complexes in
kshv-infected cells appears result extended half-life k-cyclin and
may explain role kaposi sarcoma.
