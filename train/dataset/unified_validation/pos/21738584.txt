virus proteins alter protein pathways host toward synthesis viral
particles breaking making edges via binding host proteins. this
study, developed computational approach predict viral sequence hotspots
for binding host proteins based sequences viral host proteins and
literature-curated virus-host protein interactome data. use motif discovery 
algorithm repeatedly collections sequences viral proteins immediate 
binding partners host targets choose motifs are
conserved viral sequences highly statistically enriched among binding
partners virus protein targeted host proteins. results match experimental 
data binding sites nef host proteins mapk1, vav1, lck, hck,
hla-a, cd4, fyn, gnb2l1 high statistical significance poor
predictor nef binding sites highly flexible, hoop-like regions. predicted
hotspots recapture cd8 cell epitopes hiv nef highlighting importance 
modulating virus-host interactions. host proteins potentially targeted or
outcompeted nef appear crowding cell receptor, natural killer cell
mediated cytotoxicity, neurotrophin signaling pathways. scanning hiv nef
motifs multiple alignments hepatitis c protein ns5a produces results
consistent literature, indicating potential value hotspot
discovery advancing understanding virus-host crosstalk.
