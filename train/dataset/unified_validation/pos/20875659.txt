htlv-1 pathogenic htlv-2 despite similar genome closely
related transactivating oncoproteins. tax-1 protein htlv-1 tax-2
from htlv-2 activate nf-κb pathway. mechanisms involved tax-1
deregulation signalling pathway thoroughly investigated, but
little known regulation tax-2. compared interaction of
tax-1 tax-2 two key nf-κb signalling factors: tak1-binding protein 2
(tab2), adaptor involved activation tak1 kinase, rela, the
active subunit canonical rela/p50 nf-κb transcription factor. tax-2 formed
stable complexes rela tab2. two nf-κb factors colocalized
with tax proteins dotted cytoplasmic structures targeted calreticulin, a
multi-process calcium-buffering chaperone. co-expression rela and/or tab2
markedly increased tax-mediated nf-κb activation. findings provide new
insights role rela, tab2 tax deregulation nf-κb
pathway.
