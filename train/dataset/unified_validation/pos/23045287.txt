human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causative agent adult
t-cell leukemia (atl). htlv-1 bzip factor (hbz), viral gene transcribed 
the antisense strand, consistently expressed atl cells promotes their
proliferation. study, found wnt pathway-related protein,
disheveled-associating protein high frequency leucine residues (daple),
interacts htlv-1 tax hbz. presence daple, tax activated
canonical wnt signaling. conversely, hbz markedly suppressed canonical wnt
activation induced either tax/daple β-catenin. mechanism of
hbz-mediated wnt suppression, found hbz targets lymphoid enhancer-binding
factor 1, one key transcription factors pathway, impairs its
dna-binding ability. also observed canonical wnt pathway not
activated htlv-1-infected cells, whereas representative noncanonical
wnt ligand, wnt5a, antagonizes canonical wnt signaling, overexpressed. 
hbz able induce wnt5a transcription enhancing promoter activity
through tgf-β pathway. importantly, knocking wnt5a atl cells
repressed cellular proliferation migration. results implicate novel roles
of hbz atl leukemogenesis dysregulation canonical and
noncanonical wnt pathways.
