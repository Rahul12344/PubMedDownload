localization vp40 marburg virus (mbgv)-infected cells studied using 
immunofluorescence immunoelectron microscopic analysis. vp40 detected 
association nucleocapsid structures, present viral inclusions at
sites virus budding. additionally, vp40 identified foci of
virus-induced membrane proliferation intracellular membrane clusters which
had appearance multivesicular bodies (mvbs). vp40-containing mvbs were
free nucleocapsids. analyzed immunogold labeling, concentration of
vp40 mvbs six times higher nucleocapsid structures. biochemical
studies showed recombinant vp40 represented peripheral membrane protein
that stably associated membranes hydrophobic interaction. recombinant
vp40 also found association membranes mvbs filopodia- or
lamellipodia-like protrusions cell surface. antibodies marker
proteins various cellular compartments showed vp40-positive membranes
contained lamp-1 transferrin receptor, confirming belong the
late endosomal compartment. vp40-positive membranes also associated with
actin. western blot analysis purified mbgv structural proteins demonstrated
trace amounts actin, lamp-1, rab11 (markers recycling endosomes), while
markers cellular compartments absent. data indicate mbgv 
vp40 able interact membranes late endosomes course viral
infection. capability independent mbgv proteins.
