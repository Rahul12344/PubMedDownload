epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (ebna 2) activates transcription specific
genes essential b-lymphocyte transformation. ebna 2 acidic
activation domain interacts general transcription factors tfiib,
tfiih, taf40. show ebna 2 specifically bound novel
nuclear protein, p100, p100 coactivate gene expression mediated by
the ebna 2 acidic domain. ebna 2 acidic domain used affinity purify
p100. cdna clones encoding p100 open reading frame identified the
basis peptide sequences purified protein. antibody p100
coimmunoprecipitated p100 ebna 2 epstein-barr virus-transformed
lymphocyte extracts, indicating ebna 2 p100 complexed vivo. p100 
overexpression cells specifically augmented ebna 2 acidic domain-mediated
activation. coactivating effect probably mediated p100 interaction with
tfiie. bacterially expressed p100 specifically adsorbs tfiie nuclear
extracts, vitro-translated p56 p34 tfiie subunit independently bind
to p100. p100 also appears essential normal cell growth, since cell
viability reduced antisense p100 rna restored sense p100 rna
expression.
