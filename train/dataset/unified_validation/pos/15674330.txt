epigenetic regulation gene expression critical maintenance of
cellular homeostasis. dysregulation normal epigenetic transcription occurs 
abnormal physiological conditions, seen cancer cells cells
infected parasites, making mechanism underlying abnormal epigenetic
transcription great interest. gene expression human t-cell leukemia virus
type 1 (htlv-1) regulated viral transcriptional stimulator, tax. we
herein report novel mechanism transcription htlv-1 long terminal
repeat (ltr) regulated tax. study, determined tax is
able activate transcription ltr, even heavily methylated.
in addition, methyl-cpg-binding domain 2 (mbd2) protein played important
role tax-mediated transcriptional activation. demonstrated importance
of physical interaction tax mbd2 enhancing transcriptional
activity tax methylated ltr. furthermore, identified the
formation protein complex composed mbd2 tax bound methylated
ltr. propose new model epigenetic regulation mbd2 acting concert
with virally encoded transactivator, tax. observation provides insight into
the epigenetic regulation gene expression diverse mechanisms of
transcriptional regulation using methylated promoters.
