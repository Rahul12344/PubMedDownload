we show first time actin, troponin c, alzheimer amyloid
precursor protein (aap), pro-interleukin 1 beta (pro-il-1 beta), are
substrates protease encoded human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
type-1. seen non-viral protein substrates hiv
protease, presence glu residues p2' position appears play an
important role substrate recognition. three four bonds cleaved in
actin, two three troponin c, bonds hydrolyzed aap and
pro-il-1 beta p2' glu residue. fact, glu residues accommodated in
all positions p4 p4' surrounding scissile bond substrates the
hiv proteases, many 4 adjacent glu residues seen one the
bonds cleaved aap. study non-viral protein substrates also
revealed unexpected amino acids gly, arg, glu scissile bond
itself rather conventional hydrophobic amino acids. hiv-2
protease hydrolyzed actin manner similar hiv-1 enzyme, but
its cleavage troponin c distinct split bond adjacent a
triplet glu residues p2, p3, p4 refractory hiv-1
enzyme. documentation cleavage sites several important cellular
proteins noted extended understanding features a
substrate recognized multi sub-site proteases retroviral
maturation. moreover, present work adds accumulating body evidence
which demonstrates enzymes damage crucial structural and
regulatory cellular proteins ever activity expressed outside the
viral particle itself.
