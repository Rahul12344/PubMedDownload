viral attachment specific host receptors first step viral infection 
and serves essential function selection target cells. mammalian
reoviruses highly useful experimental models studies viral
pathogenesis show promise vectors oncolytics vaccines. reoviruses 
engage cells binding carbohydrates immunoglobulin superfamily
member, junctional adhesion molecule-a (jam-a). jam-a exists cell surface 
as homodimer formed extensive contacts n-terminal
immunoglobulin-like domains. report crystal structure reovirus
attachment protein sigma1 complex soluble form jam-a. sigma1
protein disrupts jam-a dimer, engaging single jam-a molecule via virtually 
the interface used jam-a homodimerization. thus, reovirus takes 
advantage adhesive nature immunoglobulin-superfamily receptor by
usurping ligand-binding site molecule attach cell surface. 
the dissociation constant (k(d)) interaction sigma1 jam-a is
1,000-fold lower homophilic interaction jam-a molecules,
indicating jam-a strongly prefers sigma1 ligand. analysis reovirus
mutants engineered plasmid-based reverse genetics revealed residues sigma1 
required binding jam-a infectivity cultured cells. studies
define biophysical mechanisms reovirus cell attachment provide platform 
for manipulating reovirus tropism enhance vector targeting.
