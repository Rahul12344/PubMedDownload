objective: identify interaction influenza virus pb1-f2 human
modulator apoptosis 1 (moap-1).
methods: recombinant plasmid pact2-moap-1 constructed co-transformed 
into yeast ah109 pgbkt7-pb1-f2. growth co-transformants on
quadruple dropout medium beta-galactosidase activity reporter gene
were tested. confirmed interaction cellular protein moap-1 
pb1-f2 glutathione s-transferase (gst) pull-down co-immunoprecipitation
(co-ip) assays. addition, investigated effect pb1-f2 moap-1
protein level western blot.
results: results yeast two-hybrid assay showed moap-1 specifically
interacted pb1-f2 yeast cells. furthermore, binding moap-1 with
pb1-f2 demonstrated glutathione s-transferase pull-down co-ip assays. 
pb1-f2 could upregulate exogenous moap-1 protein level.
conclusion: results suggested influenza virus pb1-f2 interacted with
moap-1 might involved regulation cell growth apoptosis
via association moap-1.
