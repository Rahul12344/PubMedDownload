the large tumor antigen (tag) simian virus 40 regulates transcription the
viral genes. early promoter repressed tag binds origin dna
replication begins, whereas late promoter activated tag both
replication-dependent -independent mechanisms. previously shown that
activation diminished site viral enhancer factor
tef-1 binds disrupted. show nh2-terminal region tag binds 
to tea domain tef-1, dna binding domain also found drosophila
scalloped saccharomyces cerevisiae tec1 proteins. interaction
inhibits dna binding tef-1 activates transcription vitro subset 
of naturally occurring late start sites. sites also activated by
mutations dna motifs tef-1 binds. therefore, tef-1 appears to
function repressor late transcription, involvement the
early-to-late shift viral transcription discussed. mutation ser-189 
in tag, reduces transformation efficiency certain assays, disrupts the
interaction tef-1. thus, tef-1 might also regulate genes involved growth 
control.
