simian virus 40 (sv40) large antigen (lt) multifunctional protein 
important viral replication oncogenic transformation. previously,
infection monkey human cells sv40 shown lead induction
of dna damage response signaling, required efficient viral
replication. however, clear lt sufficient induce damage
response and, so, genetic requirements functional consequences
might be. here, show expression lt alone, without replication
origin, induce key dna damage response markers including accumulation 
gamma-h2ax 53bp1 nuclear foci. dna damage-signaling components
downstream atm/atr kinases induced, including chk1 chk2. lt also
bound claspin mediator protein, normally facilitates atr activation
of chk1 monitors cellular replication origins. stimulation damage
response lt depends mainly binding bub1 rather the
retinoblastoma protein. lt long known stabilize p53 despite
functionally inactivating it. show activation dna damage
response lt via bub1 appears play major role p53 stabilization by
promoting phosphorylation p53 ser15. accompanying dna damage
response, lt induces tetraploidy, also dependent bub1 binding. taken 
together, data suggest lt, via bub1 binding, breaches genome integrity
mechanisms, leading dna damage responses, p53 stabilization, tetraploidy.
