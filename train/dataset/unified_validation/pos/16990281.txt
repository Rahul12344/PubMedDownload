the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, tat protein plays key role virus
multiplication. apoptotic property, production highly
controlled. depends upon a3 splicing site utilization. key control of
site a3 activity ess2 splicing silencer, located within long 
stem-loop structure 3 (sls3), far downstream site a3. here, enzymatic
footprints, demonstrate presence several heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (hnrnp) a1-binding sites sls3 show importance the
c-terminal gly domain hnrnp a1 formation stable complexes containing
several hnrnp a1 molecules bound sls3. mutations uag triplets
in ess2 strongly reduce overall hnrnp a1 binding, showing central role of
ess2 hnrnp a1 assembly sls2-sls3. using nmr spectroscopy, demonstrate
the direct interaction ess2 rna recognition motifs domains hnrnp
a1. interaction limited effect rna two-dimensional structure. the
sr proteins sc35 srp40 found previously strong activators site 
a3 utilization. enzymatic chemical footprints, delineate their
respective binding sites sls2 sls3 find strong similarity between
the hnrnp a1-, sc35-, srp40-binding sites. strongest sc35-binding site
only modest contribution site a3 activation. hence, main role sr 
proteins site a3 counteract hnrnp a1 binding ess2 ese2. indeed,
we found ese2 inhibitory properties ability bind hnrnp
a1.
