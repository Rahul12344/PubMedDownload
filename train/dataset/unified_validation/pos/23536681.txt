the arenaviruses important family emerging viruses includes
several causative agents severe hemorrhagic fevers humans represent
serious public health problems. crucial step arenavirus life cycle is
maturation envelope glycoprotein precursor (gpc) cellular
subtilisin kexin isozyme 1 (ski-1)/site 1 protease (s1p). comparison the
currently known sequences arenavirus gpcs revealed presence highly
conserved aromatic residue position p7 relative ski-1/s1p cleavage side
in old world clade c new world arenaviruses new world viruses of
clades b cellular substrates ski-1/s1p. using combination of
molecular modeling structure-function analysis, found residue y285 of
ski-1/s1p, distal catalytic triad, implicated molecular
recognition aromatic "signature residue" p7 gpc old world
lassa virus. using quantitative biochemical approach, show y285 of
ski-1/s1p crucial efficient processing peptides derived old
world clade c new world arenavirus gpcs clade b
new world arenavirus gpcs. data suggest coevolution their
mammalian hosts, gpcs old world clade c new world viruses expanded the
molecular contacts ski-1/s1p beyond classical four-amino-acid
recognition sequences currently occupy extended binding pocket.
