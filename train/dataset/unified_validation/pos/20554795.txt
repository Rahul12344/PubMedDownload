the non-structural protein ns2, also called nuclear export protein, influenza 
a virus contains leucine-rich nuclear-export signal could guide viral
ribonucleoproteins cross nuclear pore complex (npc) complete
directional nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. study, human nucleoporin 98
(hnup98), npc protein, identified ns2-binding protein using yeast
two-hybrid screening human cdna library. interaction ns2 hnup98 
was confirmed yeast mammalian cells. mapping tests demonstrated
that aa 22-53 n-terminal region ns2 the
glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine (glfg) repeat domain (aa 1-511) hnup98
are crucial interaction two proteins. confocal microscopy showed
that hnup98 could specifically recruit ns2 nucleoli process 
was inhibited leptomycin b, specific inhibitor human chromosomal region
maintenance 1 protein. ns2 recruitment nucleoli n-terminal
glfg repeat domain hnup98, c-terminal domain. moreover,
influenza virus infection downregulated nup98 levels significantly 293t and
madin-darby canine kidney cells. overexpression glfg repeat domain of
hnup98 apparently inhibited virus propagation. together, findings reveal
the interaction hnup98 ns2. glfg repeat domain hnup98 might
competitively inhibit interaction ns2 endogenous hnup98,
consequently inhibiting virus propagation.
