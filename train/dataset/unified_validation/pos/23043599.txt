the influenza virus (iav) protein pb1-f2, encoded alternative
orf pb1 polymerase gene, implicated important virulence
factor apoptosis inducer. however, molecular mechanism pb1-f2 function
remains elusive. study, eight cellular proteins identified as
potential pb1-f2 interacting partners using yeast two-hybrid system. two
positive candidate proteins, guanine nucleotide binding protein (g protein) beta 
polypeptide 2 (gβ2) macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif), were
selected characterized. interaction mif gβ2 pb1-f2 
was confirmed gst pull-down co-immunoprecipitation assays. confocal
laser microscopy showed interaction pb1-f2 two cellular 
proteins occurred cytoplasm. novel interactions pb1-f2 and
host proteins provide pieces evidence investigation the
pathogenic mechanism iav.keywords: influenza virus; pb1-f2; yeast
two-hybrid; protein-protein interaction.
