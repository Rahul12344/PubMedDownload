hepatitis c virus (hcv) f protein encoded +1 reading frame viral
genome. overlaps core protein coding sequence, multiple
mechanisms expression proposed. full-length f protein 
is synthesized translational ribosomal frameshift codons 9 11 the
core protein sequence labile protein. using combination genetic,
biochemical, cell biological approaches, demonstrate hcv f
protein bind proteasome subunit protein alpha3, reduces the
f-protein level cells dose-dependent manner. deletion-mapping analysis
identified amino acids 40 60 f protein alpha3-binding domain.
this alpha3-binding domain f protein together upstream sequence
could significantly destabilize green fluorescent protein, otherwise
stable protein. analyses using f-protein mutant lacking lysine a
cell line contained temperature-sensitive e1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme
indicated degradation f protein ubiquitin independent. based 
on observations well observation f protein could be
degraded directly 20s proteasome vitro, propose full-length
hcv f protein well f protein initiating codon 26 degraded an
ubiquitin-independent pathway mediated proteasome subunit alpha3. 
the ability f protein bind alpha3 raises possibility the
hcv f protein may regulate protein degradation cells.
