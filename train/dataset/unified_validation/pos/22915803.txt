dnajc14 hsp40 family member broadly modulates flavivirus replication. 
the mechanism dnajc14 stoichiometrically participates flavivirus
replication complex (rc) formation unknown; reduced elevated levels
result replication inhibition. using yellow fever virus (yfv), demonstrate 
that dnajc14 redistributes clusters yfv nonstructural proteins via a
transmembrane domain newly identified membrane-binding domain (mbd), 
both mediate targeting detergent-resistant membranes. furthermore, rc 
dnajc14 reside part protein interaction network remains 1%
triton solubilization. mutagenesis studies demonstrate entry this
protein interaction network requires dnajc14 c-terminal self-interaction
domain. fusion dnajc14 mbd self-interaction domain another hsp40 
family protein sufficient confer yfv-inhibitory activity. findings
support novel model dnajc14 action includes specific membrane targeting
of dnajc14 yfv replication proteins, formation protein
interactions, microdomain-specific chaperone event leading rc formation.
this process alters properties rc membrane results the
formation protein scaffold maintains rc.
