we shown human t-cell leukemia virus type (htlv-i) gene expression is
negatively regulated u5 repressive element (u5re) long terminal
repeat (ltr). isolate factors binding u5re, screened cdna expression
library south-western blotting u5re probe. screening 2 x10(6) clones
gave positive clone 3.8 kb insert encoding novel 671 residue
polypeptide, named htlv-i u5re binding protein 1 (hub1), five zinc finger
domains kr端ppel-associated box like domain; hub1 may related a
repressor belonging kr端ppel type zinc finger protein. 4.0 kb mrna for
hub1 ubiquitously expressed among human tissues tested. hub1 recognizes
the tccacccc sequence core motif exerts strong repressive effect on
htlv-i ltr-mediated expression. new repressive domain, named hub1 repressive
(hur) domain, identified, rather kr端ppel-associated box like domain.
the n-terminal region upstream hur domain seemed also indispensable to
the repression. thus, propose hub1 new type repressor plays an
important role htlv-i u5-mediated repression.
