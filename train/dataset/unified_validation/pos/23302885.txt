the adenovirus large e1a (l-e1a) protein prototypical transcriptional
activator, functions action conserved transcriptional
activation domain, cr3. cr3 interacts mediator subunit, med23, has
been linked transcriptional activity cr3. unbiased proteomic
analysis revealed human adenovirus 5 (hadv5) l-e1a associated many 
mediator subunits. med23-depleted cells med23 knockout (ko) cells,
l-e1a deficient association mediator subunits, suggesting 
med23 links cr3 mediator complex. short interfering rna (sirna)-mediated
depletion several mediator subunits suggested differential effects various 
subunits transcriptional activation hadv5 early genes. addition to
med23, mediator subunits med14 med26 also essential the
transcription hadv5 early genes. l-e1a proteome contained med26-associated
super elongation complex. catalytic component elongation complex,
cdk9, important transcriptional activity l-e1a hadv5
replication. results suggest l-e1a-mediated transcriptional activation
involves transcriptional elongation step, like hiv tat, constitutes a
therapeutic target inhibition hadv replication.
