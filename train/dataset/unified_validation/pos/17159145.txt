epstein-barr nuclear antigen (ebna) leader protein (ebnalp) coactivates promoters
with ebna2 important epstein-barr virus immortalization b cells.
investigation role histone deacetylases (hdacs) ebnalp ebna2
promoter regulation identified ebnalp ebna2 associated with
hdac4 lymphoblastoid cell line. furthermore, transcription-deficient
ebnalp point mutant associate hdac4. hdac4 5 overexpression
repressed ebna2 activation ebnalp coactivation, whereas hdacs had
little effect. moreover, ebnalp expression decreased nuclear hdac4. expression of
14-3-3 anchors hdac4 cytoplasm, increased ebnalp effects, reversed
hdac4 5 repression. hdac4 reversal depended hdac4 nuclear export
sequence. consistent ebnalp coactivation mediated nuclear hdac4
depletion, hdac4 overexpression increased nuclear hdac4 specifically
repressed ebna2-dependent activation well ebnalp-dependent coactivation.
also, ebnalp, hdac4, 14-3-3 could immunoprecipitated single complex. 
thus, data strongly support model ebnalp coactivates
transcription relocalizing hdac4 5 ebna2 activated promoters the
cytoplasm. observed ebnalp effects likely also part hdac5,
which highly homologous hdac4.
