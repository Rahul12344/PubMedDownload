in murine fibroblasts, efficient proteolysis reovirus outer capsid protein
sigma3 cell entry virions requires acid-dependent lysosomal
cysteine protease cathepsin l. importance cathepsin l infection of
other cell types unknown. report acid-independent lysosomal
cysteine protease cathepsin mediates outer capsid processing macrophage-like
p388d cells. p388d cells supported infection virions strain lang, not
strain c43. genetic studies revealed difference determined s4,
the viral gene segment encodes sigma3. c43-derived subvirion particles 
lack sigma3 replicated normally p388d cells, suggesting difference in
infectivity lang c43 virions level sigma3 processing.
infection p388d cells lang virions inhibited broad spectrum
cysteine protease inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane
but nh(4)cl, raises endocytic ph thereby inhibits
acid-dependent proteases cathepsins l b. outer capsid processing 
infection p388d cells lang virions also inhibited cathepsin
s-specific inhibitor. furthermore, presence nh(4)cl, cell lines
engineered express cathepsin supported infection lang, c43,
virions. results thus indicate differences susceptibility to
cathepsin s-mediated sigma3 processing responsible strain differences 
reovirus infection macrophage-like p388d cells cathepsin
s-expressing cells. additionally, data suggest acid dependence of
reovirus infections cell types may reflect low ph requirement
for activities lysosomal proteases rather, other
acid-dependent aspect cell entry.
