the matrix (m1) protein influenza virus conserved multifunctional
protein plays essential roles regulating viral life cycle. study
demonstrated m1 able interact complement c1qa plays an
important inhibitory function classical complement pathway. n-terminal
domain m1 protein required binding globular region c1qa.
as consequence, m1 blocked interaction c1qa heat-aggregated igg
in vitro inhibited haemolysis. shown m1 protein prevented the
complement-mediated neutralization influenza virus vitro. addition,
studies mice indicated administration m1 could promote higher
virus propagation rate lung shortened survival mice infected the
virus. taken together, results suggest strongly m1 protein plays a
critical role protecting influenza virus host innate immune system.
