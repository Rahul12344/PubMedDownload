epstein-barr virus (ebv; human herpesvirus 4) poses major clinical problems
worldwide. following primary infection, ebv enters form long-lived latency
in b lymphocytes, expressing viral genes, persists lifetime of
the host sporadic bursts viral replication. switch latency
and replication governed action multifunctional viral protein zta 
(also called bzlf1, zebra, z). using global proteomic approach, we
identified host dna damage repair protein specifically interacts zta:
53bp1. 53bp1 intimately connected atm signal transduction pathway,
which activated ebv replication. interaction 53bp1 zta
requires c-terminal ends proteins. series zta mutants show 
a wild-type ability perform basic functions zta, dimer formation,
interaction dna, transactivation viral genes, shown 
lost ability induce viral lytic cycle. mutants also is
compromised c-terminal region interaction 53bp1. addition, the
knockdown 53bp1 expression reduced viral replication, suggesting the
association zta 53bp1 involved viral replication cycle.
