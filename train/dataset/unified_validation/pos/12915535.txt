the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) us11 gene encodes multifunctional
double-stranded rna (dsrna)-binding protein expressed late infection
and packaged tegument layer virus particle. tegument
component, us11 associates nascent capsids synthesis late the
infectious cycle delivered newly infected cells times prior the
expression viral genes. us11 also abundant late protein regulates
translation association host components contains overlapping
nucleolar retention nuclear export signals, allowing accumulation both
nucleoli cytosol. thus, various times viral life cycle 
in different intracellular compartments, us11 potential execute
discrete tasks. analysis functions, however, complicated the
fact us11 essential viral replication cultured cells. to
discover new host targets us11 protein, searched cellular proteins
that interact us11 identified pat1 us11-binding protein
according multiple, independent experimental criteria. pat1 binds
microtubules, participates amyloid precursor protein trafficking, has
homology kinesin light chain (klc) carboxyl terminus. the
carboxyl-terminal dsrna-binding domain us11, also contains nucleolar
retention nuclear export signals, binds pat1, whereas 149 residues derived
from klc homology region pat1 important binding us11. pat1
and us11 colocalize within perinuclear area transiently transfected and
hsv-1-infected cells. 149 amino acids derived klc homology region
are required colocalization two polypeptides. furthermore, although
pat1 normally accumulates nuclear compartment, us11 expression results 
the exclusion pat1 nucleus accumulation perinuclear
space. similarly, us11 accumulate nucleoli infected cells that
overexpress pat1. results establish us11 pat1 associate,
resulting altered subcellular distribution polypeptides. the
association pat1, cellular trafficking protein homology klc,
and us11, along recent report demonstrating interaction us11
and ubiquitous kinesin heavy chain (r. j. diefenbach et al., j. virol.
76:3282-3291, 2002), suggests associations may important the
intracellular movement viral components.
