yaba-like disease virus (yldv) gene 7l encodes seven-transmembrane g
protein-coupled receptor 53 % amino acid identity human cc chemokine
receptor 8 (ccr8). initial characterization 7l showed 56 kda
cell-surface glycoprotein binds human ccl1 high affinity (kd=0.6 nm) and
induces signal transduction activation heterotrimeric g proteins and
downstream protein kinases. characterization yldv 7l presented here
and shows murine cc chemokines induce g-protein activation via 7l
receptor, despite low binding affinity receptor. addition,
when expressed recombinant vaccinia virus (vacv), yldv 7l found the
outer envelope vacv extracellular enveloped virus. contribution 7l to
poxvirus pathogenesis investigated infection mice recombinant
vacv expressing 7l (vdeltab8r-7l) compared outcome infection 
by parental revertant control viruses. intranasal intradermal
models, expression 7l caused attenuation vacv. role protein 
viral virulence discussed.
