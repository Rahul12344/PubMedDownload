the replication simian virus 40 (sv40) dna vitro requires trimeric
single-stranded dna (ssdna)-binding protein called hssb rpa. hssb supports the
unwinding dna containing sv40 origin presence viral-encoded 
t antigen required initiation rna primer synthesis well as
processive elongation dna catalyzed dna polymerase delta holoenzyme. in
this report show transcription positive cofactor 4 (pc4), a
ssdna-binding protein, forms complexes hssb ssdna markedly affects
the replication functions hssb. pc4 supports antigen-catalyzed unwinding 
sv40 origins lieu hssb inhibits rna primer synthesis and
polymerase delta-catalyzed dna chain elongation reactions. inhibitory
effects reversed addition excess hssb. depending the
concentration hssb, pc4 capable either inhibiting activating sv40 dna
replication measured mono- dipolymerase systems. possible role of
pc4 initiation dna replication discussed.
