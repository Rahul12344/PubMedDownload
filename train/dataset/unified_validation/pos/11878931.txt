poxviruses encode soluble cytokine receptors interfere host immune
functions. cells infected vaccinia virus (vv) strains ussr, lister, and
evans express soluble cell surface tumor necrosis factor receptors (vtnfrs). 
we characterized vtnfr activity vv ussr identified open reading
frame encodes soluble cell surface activity, hereafter referred 
as vv cytokine response modifier e (vv crme). expression characterization
from recombinant vv baculovirus showed vv crme 18-kda protein that
bound human, mouse, rat tnf-alpha, human lt alpha. vv crme inhibited 
the cytotoxic apoptotic activities human, mouse rat, tnf in
vitro. nonetheless, murine intranasal model, ussr recombinants lacking crme 
were attenuated, demonstrating role vivo. furthermore, expression vv or
cowpox virus vtnfrs vv strain wr (which express vtnfr) was
shown enhance virulence murine model.
