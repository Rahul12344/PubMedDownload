the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (ltr) potent
transcriptional enhancer. identified several putative binding sites the
tef-1 family transcription factors (tef-1, rtef-1, dtef-1, etf) the
proximal negative regulatory element ltr. gel mobility shift assays
revealed strong tef-1 factor binding one site using nuclear extracts cv-1
cells human breast cancer cell line mcf-7. mutation site
increased basal activity ltr. transient transfection assays, tef-1
squelched basal ltr activity completely abrogated response the
glucocorticoid dexamethasone. rtef-1 dtef-1 little effect basal
activity, whereas etf activated ltr. tef-1 factors also interfered with
the response dexamethasone. taken together, results reveal important
new role tef-1 factors regulating mmtv ltr activity suggest tef-1
factors might participate mammary tumorigenesis.
