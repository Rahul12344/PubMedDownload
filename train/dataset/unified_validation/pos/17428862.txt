the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) 7a protein, is
not expressed known coronaviruses, induce apoptosis various cell 
lines. study, show overexpression bcl-xl, prosurvival
member bcl-2 family, blocks 7a-induced apoptosis, suggesting the
mechanism apoptosis induction 7a level upstream the
bcl-2 family. coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed 7a interacts with
bcl-xl prosurvival proteins (bcl-2, bcl-w, mcl-1, a1) 
the proapoptotic proteins (bax, bak, bad, bid). good correlation between
the abilities 7a deletion mutants induce apoptosis interact with
bcl-xl observed, suggesting 7a triggers apoptosis interfering
directly prosurvival function bcl-xl. interestingly, amino acids 224 
and 225 within c-terminal transmembrane domain bcl-xl essential for
the interaction 7a protein, although bh3 domain bcl-xl also
contributes interaction. addition, fractionation experiments showed
that 7a colocalized bcl-xl endoplasmic reticulum well the
mitochondria, suggesting may form complexes different membranous
compartments.
