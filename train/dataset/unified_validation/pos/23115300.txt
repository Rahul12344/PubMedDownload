autophagy known essential component host innate adaptive
immunity. several herpesviruses developed various strategies evade this
antiviral host defense. herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) blocks autophagy in
fibroblasts neurons, icp34.5 protein important the
resistance hsv-1 autophagy interaction autophagy
machinery protein beclin 1. icp34.5 also counteracts shutoff protein
synthesis mediated double-stranded rna (dsrna)-dependent protein kinase
pkr inhibiting phosphorylation eukaryotic translation initiation factor
2α (eif2α) pkr/eif2α signaling pathway. us11 late gene product of
hsv-1, also able preclude host shutoff direct inhibition of
pkr. present study, unveil previously uncharacterized function of
us11 demonstrating antiautophagic activity. show expression of
us11 able block autophagy autophagosome formation hela cells
and fibroblasts. furthermore, immediate-early expression us11 icp34.5
deletion mutant virus sufficient render cells resistant pkr-induced 
and virus-induced autophagy. pkr expression pkr binding domain us11
are required antiautophagic activity us11. however, unlike icp34.5,
us11 interact beclin 1. suggest inhibition autophagy 
observed cells infected hsv-1 results activity only
icp34.5 beclin 1 also us11 direct interaction pkr.
