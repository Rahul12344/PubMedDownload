hiv-1 integrase (in) key enzyme catalyzing proviral dna integration
step. although enzyme catalyzes integration step accurately vitro,
whether sufficient vivo integration interacts the
cellular machinery remains unclear. set yeast cellular integration system
where integrase expressed sole hiv-1 protein targeted the
chromosomes. simple eukaryotic model, integrase necessary and
sufficient insertion dna containing viral ltrs genome,
thereby allowing study isolated integration step independently of
other viral mechanisms. furthermore, yeast system used identify
cellular mechanisms involved integration step allowed us show the
role homologous recombination systems. demonstrated physical interactions
between hiv-1 rad51 protein showed hiv-1 integrase activity could
be inhibited cell vitro rad51 protein. data allowed the
identification rad51 novel vitro cofactor able regulate the
activity retroviral enzyme, thereby acting potential cellular
restriction factor hiv infection.
