bel1, transactivator prototype foamy virus (pfv), plays pivotal roles the
replication pfv. previous studies shown bel1 bears nuclear
localization signal (nls), amino acid sequence remains unclear the
corresponding importins identified. report, inserted
various fragments bel1 egfp-gst fusion protein investigated 
subcellular localization fluorescence microscopy. found the
215prqkrpr221 fragment could direct nuclear localization, accords 
consensus sequence k(k/r)x(k/r) monopartite nls. point mutation experiments
revealed k218, r219, r221 essential nuclear localization 
bel1. results gst-pulldown showed bel1 fragment residues
215-223, bears nls, interacts kpna1, kpna6, kpna7. result
suggests kpna1, kpna6, kpna7 maybe involved bel1 nuclear
translocation.
