protein nuclear import generally mediated basic nuclear localization
signals (nlss) serve targets importin alpha (imp alpha) nls
receptor. imp alpha turn bound importin beta (imp beta), targets
the resultant protein complex nucleus. here, report the
arginine-rich nls sequences present human immunodeficiency virus type 1
regulatory proteins tat rev fail interact imp alpha instead bind 
directly imp beta. using vitro nuclear import assays, demonstrate that
imp alpha entirely dispensable tat rev nuclear import. contrast,
imp beta proved sufficient necessary, beta-like import
factors, transportin, unable support tat rev nuclear import.
using vitro competition assays, demonstrated target sites on
imp beta imp alpha, tat, rev binding either identical least
overlap. interaction tat rev imp beta also similar imp
alpha binding inhibited rangtp rangdp, finding that
may part explain interaction rev nuclear rna export factor with
target rna species efficient cell nucleus yet released the
cytoplasm. together, studies define novel class arginine-rich nls
sequences direct targets imp beta therefore function
independently imp alpha.
