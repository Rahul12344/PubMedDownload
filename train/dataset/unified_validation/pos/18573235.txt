flavivirus pre-membrane (prm) protein important proper folding and
secretion envelope (e) protein. however, non-structural functions prm
protein context virus life-cycle poorly known. study, we
aimed elucidate dengue virus (dv) prm protein interacts host proteins 
and contributes viral pathogenesis screening human liver cdna
yeast-two-hybrid library. study identified vacuolar atpase (v-atpase) a
novel interacting partner dv prm protein aminoacid residues 76 80 
of prm protein crucial mediate v-atpase binding. showed v-atpase
plays important role mediating low-ph dependent entry dv. biological
significance prm-v-atpase interaction also elucidated shown
that association critical influence efficient virus egression. this
study highlighted first time flavivirus prm protein interacts with
v-atpase v-atpase mediates entry egression dv.
