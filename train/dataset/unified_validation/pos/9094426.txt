the intracellular proteolytic processing hiv envelope glycoprotein gp160 
gp120/gp41 essential step virus infectivity. several convertases,
belonging pro-protein convertase family, proposed candidate
gp160 processing enzymes. demonstrate using rt-pcr resting human t4 
lymphocytes weakly express pc7, furin, pc5 mrna whereas lymphocytes activated
under conditions favoring hiv replication express 5-10-fold higher levels of
furin pc7. report, examined capability newly cloned
convertase pc7 cleave gp160 gp120/gp41 compared furin. was
carried cell-based assay whereby gp160 cognate convertase
were co-expressed constitutively secreting bsc40 cells the
regulated att20 cells, well using two vitro assays examined the
cleavage gp160 synthetic peptide spanning cleavage site. data 
demonstrate pc7 cleave specifically cell-type specific manner
gp160 gp120gp41, suggesting furin pc7 far major
pc-like candidate gp160 convertase t4 lymphocytes.
