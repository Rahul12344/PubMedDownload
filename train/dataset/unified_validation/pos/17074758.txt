vaccinia virus, prototypic member orthopoxvirus genus, encodes the
mitochondrial-localized protein f1l functions protect cells from
apoptotic death inhibits cytochrome c release. previously showed f1l 
interacts pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family member bak inhibits activation 
of bak following apoptotic stimulus (wasilenko, s. t., banadyga, l., bond, d.,
and barry, m. (2005) j. virol. 79, 14031-14043). addition bak, the
pro-apoptotic protein bax also capable initiating cytochrome c release
suggesting vaccinia virus infection could also inhibit bax activity. we
show f1l inhibits activity pro-apoptotic protein bax by
inhibiting oligomerization n-terminal activation bax. f1l expression also 
inhibited subcellular redistribution bax mitochondria the
insertion bax outer mitochondrial membrane. ability f1l to
inhibit bax activation require bak, f1l expression inhibited
cytochrome c release bax activation bak-deficient cells. interaction
between bax f1l detected infection, suggesting f1l functions 
upstream bax activation. notably, f1l capable interacting the
bh3-only protein biml shown co-immunoprecipitation, f1l expression
inhibited apoptosis induced biml. studies suggest that, addition to
interacting pro-apoptotic protein bak, f1l also functions indirectly 
inhibit activation bax, likely interfering pro-apoptotic
activity bh3-only proteins biml.
