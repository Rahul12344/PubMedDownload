immunomodulators pathogens frequently affect multiple cellular targets, thus
preventing recognition different immune cells. instance, k5 modulator 
of immune recognition (mir2) kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus prevents 
activation cytotoxic cells, natural killer cells, natural killer cells
by downregulating major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class molecules, the
mhc-like molecule cd1, cell adhesion molecules icam-1 pecam, the
co-stimulatory molecule b7.2. k5 belongs family viral- and
cellular-membrane-spanning ring ubiquitin ligases. limited number of
transmembrane proteins shown targeted degradation this
family, unknown whether additional targets exist. describe a
quantitative proteomics approach identify novel targets protein
family. using stable isotope labeling amino acids, compared proteome of
plasma, golgi, endoplasmic reticulum membranes presence absence of
k5. mass spectrometric protein identification revealed four proteins were
consistently underrepresented plasma membrane k5 expression cells: mhc 
i (as expected), bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (bst-2, cd316), activated
leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (alcam, cd166) syntaxin-4. downregulation of
each proteins independently confirmed immunoblotting with
specific antibodies. demonstrate alcam bona fide target of
both k5 myxomavirus homolog m153r. upon exiting endoplasmic
reticulum, alcam ubiquitinated presence wild-type, not
ring-deficient acidic motif-deficient, k5, targeted lysosomal
degradation via multivesicular body pathway. since alcam ligand for
cd6, member immunological synapse cells, removal viral
immune modulators implies role cd6 recognition pathogens t
cells. unbiased global proteome analysis therefore revealed novel
immunomodulatory functions pathogen proteins.
