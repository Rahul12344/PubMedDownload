previous examination effect tcf-4 transcription human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) promoter human astrocytic cells found
that tcf-4 affects hiv-1 promoter gc-rich domain (nt -80 nt
-68). here, physical interaction functional consequence tcf4-sp1
contact characterized. shown expression tcf-4 u-87 mg
(human astrocytic) cells decreased basal sp1-mediated transcription the
hiv-1 promoter. results gst pull-down assay, well combined
immunoprecipitation western blot analysis protein extracts u-87 mg
cells, revealed interaction sp1 tcf-4. using vitro protein
chromatography, region sp1 contacts tcf-4 mapped aa 266-350.
it also found that, cell-free extracts, tcf-4 prevented dsdna-dependent
protein kinase (dna-pk)-mediated sp1 phosphorylation. surprisingly, tcf-4 failed 
to decrease sp1-mediated transcription hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr)
and sp1 phosphorylation cells expressing hiv-1 tat. results from
immunoprecipitation/western blotting demonstrated tcf-4 lost ability 
interact sp1, tat, tat-transfected cells. taken together,
these findings suggest activity hiv-1 promoter influenced by
phosphorylation sp1, affected tat dna-pk. interactions among
tcf-4, sp1 and/or tat may determine level viral gene transcription in
human astrocytic cells.
