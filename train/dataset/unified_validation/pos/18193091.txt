accurate chromosomal segregation monitored mitotic checkpoint, an
increased rate chromosomal missegregation leads chromosomal instability
(cin). here, demonstrate hbv x protein (hbx) binds bubr1, component
of mitotic checkpoint complex co-localizes bubr1 the
kinetochores. hbx binding bubr1 attenuates association bubr1 and
cdc20, activator anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c) and
induces slippage mitotic arrest presence microtubule poisons. in
addition, hbx binding bubr1 results accumulation lagging chromosomes
and chromosome bridges. contrast, c-terminally truncated hbx mutant
(hbx(1-100)) fails bind bubr1 cause aberrant chromosomal
segregation. provides novel mechanism dysregulation mitotic
checkpoint viral pathogen linking accumulation chromosomal
instability hbv-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.
