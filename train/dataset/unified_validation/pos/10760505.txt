the nh(2)-terminal end protein, named smcp, contains arid (a/t rich
interaction domain) dna binding domain similar mammalian smcy/smcx 
proteins retinoblastoma binding protein 2, shown bind african
swine fever virus encoded ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (ubcv1) using yeast
two hybrid system vitro binding assays. antisera raised the
smcp protein used show protein present cell nucleus.
immunofluorescence showed although ubcv1 present nucleus most
cells, cells cytoplasm, suggesting shuttles 
the nucleus cytoplasm. interaction co-localisation ubcv1 smcp
suggest smcp may substrate vivo enzyme.
