the n-terminal domain e3l protein vaccinia virus sequence
similarity family z-dna binding proteins defined three-dimensional
structure necessary pathogenicity mice. z-dna-binding
domains substituted similar e3l domain, virus retains its
lethality intracranial inoculation. mutations decreasing z-dna binding in
the chimera correlate decreases viral pathogenicity, analogous
mutations wild-type e3l. chimeric virus incorporating related protein that
does bind z-dna pathogenic, mutation creates z-dna binding 
makes lethal virus. ability bind z conformation thus essential to
e3l activity. finding may allow design class antiviral agents,
including agents variola (smallpox), almost identical e3l.
