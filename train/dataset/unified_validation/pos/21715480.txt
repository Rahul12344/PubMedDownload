latent hiv proviruses silenced result deacetylation methylation
of histones located viral long terminal repeat (ltr). inhibition of
histone deacetylases (hdacs) leads reemergence hiv-1 latency, 
the contribution histone lysine methyltransferases (hkmts) maintaining hiv 
latency remains uncertain. chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using
latently infected jurkat t-cell lines demonstrated hkmt enhancer of
zeste 2 (ezh2) present high levels ltr silenced hiv proviruses
and rapidly displaced following proviral reactivation. knockdown ezh2, a
key component polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2) silencing machinery,
and enzyme required trimethyl histone lysine 27 (h3k27me3)
synthesis induced 40% latent hiv proviruses. contrast, 
less 5% induction latent proviruses following knockdown suv39h1, which
is required h3k9me3 synthesis. knockdown ezh2 also sensitized latent
proviruses external stimuli, t-cell receptor stimulation, slowed
the reversion reactivated proviruses latency. similarly, cell populations
that responded poorly external stimuli carried hiv proviruses were
enriched h3k27me3 relatively depleted h3k9me3. treating latently
infected cells hkmt inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin a, targets ezh2,
led reactivation silenced proviruses, whereas chaetocin bix01294
showed minimal reactivation activities. findings suggest that
prc2-mediated silencing important feature hiv latency that
inhibitors histone methylation may play useful role induction strategies 
designed eradicate latent hiv pools.
