vpr, accessory gene product human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1),
affects viral cellular proliferation mediating long terminal repeat
activation, cell cycle arrest g2 phase, apoptosis. previously found
that vpr plays novel role regulator pre-mrna splicing vivo 
in vitro. however, cellular target vpr, well mechanism of
cellular pre-mrna splicing inhibition vpr, unknown. here, show clearly
that vpr inhibits splicing cellular pre-mrna, beta-globin pre-mrna
and immunoglobulin (ig) pre-mrna third alpha-helical domain and
arginine-rich region important ability inhibit splicing. additionally,
using mutants specific substitutions two domains vpr, demonstrated 
that interaction vpr sap145, essential splicing factor, was
indispensable splicing inhibition. finally, co-immunoprecipitation in
vitro competitive binding assays indicated vpr associates sap145 and
interferes sap145-sap49 complex formation. thus, results suggest 
cellular expression vpr may block spliceosome assembly interfering the
function sap145-sap49 complex host cells.
