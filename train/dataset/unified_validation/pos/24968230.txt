the primary role cytoplasmic viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) is
viral genome replication cellular cytoplasm. however, picornaviral rdrp
denoted 3d polymerase (3d(pol)) also enters host nucleus, function 
remains unclear. study, describe novel mechanism viral attack 
which 3d(pol) enters nucleus nuclear localization signal (nls)
and targets pre-mrna processing factor 8 (prp8) block pre-mrna splicing
and mrna synthesis. fingers domain 3d(pol) associates c-terminal 
region prp8, contains jab1/mpn domain, interferes second 
catalytic step, resulting accumulation lariat form splicing 
intermediate. endogenous pre-mrnas trapped prp8-3d(pol) complex in
enterovirus-infected cells identified classed groups associated
with cell growth, proliferation, differentiation. results suggest that
picornaviral rdrp disrupts pre-mrna splicing processes, differs viral
protease shutting cellular transcription translation contributes to
the pathogenesis viral infection.
