the e6 protein high-risk human papillomavirus types interacts and
degrades several pdz domain-containing proteins localize adherens
junctions tight junctions polarized epithelial cells. identified
the tight junction-associated multi-pdz protein patj (pals1-associated tj
protein) novel binding partner degradation target high-risk types 16 
and 18 e6. patj functions assembly evolutionarily conserved
crb-pals1-patj par6-apkc-par3 complexes critical formation 
tight junctions polarized cells. ability type 18 e6 full-length bind
to, subsequent degradation of, patj dependent c-terminal pdz
binding motif. demonstrate spliced 18 e6* protein, lacks a
c-terminal pdz binding motif, associates degrades patj independently 
full-length 18 e6. thus, patj first binding partner degraded in
response isoforms 18 e6. ability e6 utilize non-e6ap
ubiquitin ligase degradation several pdz binding partners been
suggested. also demonstrate 18 e6-mediated degradation patj not
inhibited cells e6ap silenced shrna. suggests the
e6-e6ap complex required degradation protein target.
