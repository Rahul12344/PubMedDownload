measles, caused measles virus (mev) infection, leading cause death
in children secondary infections attributable mev-induced immune
suppression. recently, shown wild-type mevs induce suppression
of protein synthesis host cells (referred "shutoff") viral
mrnas preferentially translated shutoff conditions infected cells.
to determine mechanism behind preferential translation viral mrna, 
focused 5' untranslated region (utr) nucleocapsid (n) mrna. la/ssb 
autoantigen (la) found specifically bind n-5'utr probe. recombinant 
la enhanced translation luciferase mrna containing n-5'utr (n-fluc),
and rna interference la suppressed n-fluc translation. furthermore,
recombinant mev lacking la-binding motif n-5'utr displayed delayed
viral protein synthesis growth kinetics early phase infection. these
results suggest la induced predominant translation n mrna via binding 
its 5'utr shutoff conditions. first report cellular factor
that specifically regulates paramyxovirus mrna translation.
