cd8+ cells play key role vivo control hiv-1 replication via
their cytolytic activity well ability secrete non-lytic soluble
suppressive factors. although chemokines naturally bind ccr5
(ccl3/mip-1α, ccl4/mip- 1β, ccl5/rantes) major components cd8-derived 
anti-hiv activity, evidence indicates existence additional, still
undefined, cd8-derived hiv-suppressive factors. here, report the
characterization novel anti-hiv chemokine, xcl1/lymphotactin, member of
the c-chemokine family produced primarily activated cd8+ cells and
behaves metamorphic protein, interconverting two structurally
distinct conformations (classic alternative). found xcl1 inhibits a
broad spectrum hiv-1 isolates, irrespective coreceptor-usage
phenotype. experiments stabilized variants xcl1 demonstrated hiv-1
inhibition requires access alternative, all-β conformation, which
interacts proteoglycans bind/activate specific xcr1
receptor, classic xcl1 conformation inactive. hiv-1 inhibition by
xcl1 shown occur early stage infection, via blockade viral
attachment entry host cells. analogous recently described
anti-hiv effect cxc chemokine cxcl4/pf4, xcl1-mediated inhibition is
associated direct interaction chemokine hiv-1 envelope.
these results may open new perspectives understanding mechanisms hiv-1
control reveal new molecular targets design effective therapeutic 
and preventive strategies hiv-1.
