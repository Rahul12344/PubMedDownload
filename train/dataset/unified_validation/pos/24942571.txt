enterovirus 71 (ev71) causes hand, foot, mouth disease young children 
infants. severe infection ev71 lead various neurological
complications fatal diseases. however, mechanism ev71 pathogenesis is
poorly understood. emerging evidence suggests ev71 modulates type i
interferon (ifn) cytokine responses. here, show ev71 disables
components tab2 complex 3c protein. expressed in
mammalian cells, ev71 3c interacts tab2 tak1, inhibits nf-κb
activation. furthermore, 3c mediates cleavage tab2 partners, which
requires protease activity. h40d c147s substitution 3c active sites
abolishes activity, whereas r84q v154s substitution rna binding
domain effect. 3c protein targets tab2 q113-s114, tak1 at
q360-s361, tab1 q414-g415 q451-s452, tab3 q173-g174 and
q343-g344. importantly, overexpression tab2 inhibits ev71 replication, whereas
addition cleaved fragments effect. thus, equilibrium the
tab2 complex ev71 3c represents control point viral infection. these
results suggest tak1/tab1/tab2/tab3 cleavage mediated ev71 may a
mechanism interfere inflammatory responses.importance: tak1 complex
plays critical role activation nf-κb cytokine production.
however, little known connection enterovirus 71 (ev71). we
demonstrate ev71 3c suppresses cytokine expression via cleavage tak1 
complex proteins. ev71 3c interacts tab2 tak1. furthermore,
overexpression tab2 inhibits ev71 replication, whereas addition cleaved
fragment effect. results suggest interplay ev71 
tak1 complex influences outcome viral infection.
