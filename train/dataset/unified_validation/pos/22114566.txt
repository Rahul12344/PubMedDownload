the influenza virus rna polymerase heterotrimeric complex responsible 
viral genome transcription replication nucleus infected cells. we
recently carried proteomic analysis purified polymerase expressed in
human cells identified number polymerase-associated cellular proteins.
here characterise role one host factors, sfpq/psf, virus
infection. down-regulation sfpq/psf silencing two independent sirnas
reduced virus yield 2-5 log low-multiplicity infections, the
replication unrelated viruses vsv adenovirus almost unaffected. as
the sfpq/psf protein frequently associated nono/p54, tested the
potential implication latter influenza virus replication. however,
down-regulation nono/p54 silencing two independent sirnas not
affect virus yields. down-regulation sfpq/psf sirna silencing led a
reduction delay influenza virus gene expression. immunofluorescence
analyses showed good correlation sfpq/psf np levels infected
cells. analysis virus rna accumulation silenced cells showed that
production mrna, crna vrna reduced 5-fold splicing 
not affected. likewise, accumulation viral mrna cicloheximide-treated
cells reduced 3-fold. contrast, down-regulation sfpq/psf a
recombinant virus replicon system indicated that, accumulation viral
mrna reduced 5-fold, vrna levels slightly increased. vitro
transcription recombinant rnps generated sfpq/psf-silenced cells indicated 
a 4-5-fold reduction polyadenylation alteration cap snatching. these
results indicate sfpq/psf host factor essential influenza virus
transcription increases efficiency viral mrna polyadenylation and
open possibility develop new antivirals targeting accumulation of
primary transcripts, early step infection.
