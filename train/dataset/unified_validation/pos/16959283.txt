ledgf/p75 binding-defective mutant viruses previously characterized as
replication-defective, yet rnai reveal essential role host
factor hiv-1 replication. correlative analyses protein binding viral
fitness expanded targeting 12 residues in-ledgf/p75 binding
interface. whereas many resultant viruses defective, majority 
the ins displayed wild-type vitro integration activities. though overall
trend parallel loss ledgf/p75 binding hiv-1 infectivity observed, a
strict correlation not. his-tagged in(a128q), derived phenotypically
wild-type virus, failed pull-down ledgf/p75, in(a128q) effectively
recovered reciprocal gst pull-down assay. conditions, in(h171a),
also derived phenotypically wild-type virus, interacted less efficiently
than previously described interaction-defective mutant, in(q168a). thus, the
relative affinity vitro in-ledgf/p75 interaction universal
predictor mutant viral fitness.
