human coronavirus nl63 (hcov-nl63), common human respiratory pathogen, is
associated upper lower respiratory tract disease children and
adults. currently, antiviral drugs available treat cov infections;
thus, potential drug targets need identified characterized. here, we
identify hcov-nl63 replicase gene products characterize two viral papain-like
proteases (plps), plp1 plp2, process viral replicase polyprotein.
we generated polyclonal antisera directed two predicted replicase 
nonstructural proteins (nsp3 nsp4) detected replicase proteins from
hcov-nl63-infected llc-mk2 cells immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, 
western blot assays. found hcov-nl63 replicase products detected
at 24 h postinfection proteins accumulate perinuclear sites,
consistent membrane-associated replication complexes. determine which
viral proteases responsible processing products, generated
constructs representing amino-terminal end hcov-nl63 replicase gene
and established protease cis-cleavage assays. found plp1 processes
cleavage site 1 release nsp1, whereas plp2 responsible processing 
cleavage sites 2 3 release nsp2 nsp3. expressed purified plp2
and used peptide-based assay identify cleavage sites recognized 
enzyme. furthermore, using k48-linked hexa-ubiquitin substrate and
ubiquitin-vinylsulfone inhibitor specific deubiquitinating enzymes (dubs), we
confirmed that, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) cov plpro,
hcov-nl63 plp2 dub activity. identification replicase products and
characterization hcov-nl63 plp dub activity facilitate comparative
studies cov proteases aid development novel antiviral reagents
directed human pathogens hcov-nl63 sars-cov.
