the m3 protein encoded murine gamma herpesvirus68 (gamma hv68) functions an
immune system saboteur engagement chemoattractant cytokines, thereby
altering host antiviral inflammatory responses. report crystal

two-domain beta sandwich protein unique sequence topology, forming a
tightly packed anti-parallel dimer. stoichiometry mcp-1:m3 complex 
2:2, two monomeric chemokines embedded distal ends preassociated

used m3 achieve high-affinity broad-spectrum chemokine engagement. m3
also employs structural mimicry promiscuously sequester chemokines, engaging
conservative structural elements associated chemokine homodimerization 
and binding g protein-coupled receptors.
