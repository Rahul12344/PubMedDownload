the hiv-1 nef virulence factor interacts multiple host cell-signaling
proteins. nef binds src homology 3 domains src family kinases,
resulting kinase activation important viral infectivity, replication, 
mhc-i down-regulation. itk tec family kinases also present hiv
target cells, itk linked hiv-1 infectivity replication.
however, molecular mechanism linking itk hiv-1 unknown. study, 
we explored interaction nef tec family kinases using cell-based
bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. approach, interaction 
nef partner kinase juxtaposes nonfluorescent yfp fragments fused c 
terminus protein, resulting yfp complementation bright
fluorescent signal. using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, observed
that nef interacts tec family members bmx, btk, itk tec or
txk. interaction nef occurs kinase src homology 3 domains and
localizes plasma membrane. allelic variants nef major hiv-1
subtypes interacted strongly itk assay, demonstrating highly
conserved nature interaction. selective small molecule inhibitor itk
kinase activity (bms-509744) potently blocked wild-type hiv-1 infectivity and
replication, nef-defective mutant. nef induced constitutive itk
activation transfected cells sensitive inhibitor treatment. taken 
together, results provide first evidence nef interacts with
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases tec family suggest nef provides a
mechanistic link hiv-1 itk signaling viral life cycle.
