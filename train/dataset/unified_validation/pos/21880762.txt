the barrier autointegration factor (baf) essential cellular protein with
functions mitotic nuclear reassembly, retroviral preintegration complex
stability, transcriptional regulation. molecular properties baf include
the ability bind double-stranded dna sequence-independent manner,
homodimerize, bind proteins containing lem domain. capabilities allow
baf compact dna assemble higher-order nucleoprotein complexes, nature 
of poorly understood. recently, revealed baf also acts 
potent host defense poxviral dna replication cytoplasm. here, we
extend observations examining molecular mechanism baf 
acts host defense vaccinia virus replication cytoplasmic dna 
general. interestingly, baf rapidly relocalizes transfected dna variety
of sources, demonstrating baf's activity host defense factor not
limited poxviral infection. baf's relocalization cytoplasmic foreign dna is
highly dependent upon dna binding dimerization properties not
appear require lem domain binding activity. however, lem domain
protein emerin recruited cytoplasmic dna baf-dependent manner during
both transfection vaccinia virus infection. finally, demonstrate 
dna binding dimerization capabilities baf essential function
as antipoxviral effector, presence emerin required.
together, data provide mechanistic insight baf's
molecular properties employed cells impair replication of
poxviruses respond foreign dna general.
