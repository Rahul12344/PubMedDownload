human herpes virus 8 (hhv-8) kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus the
etiologic agent kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, plasma
cell-type multicentric castleman disease (mcd). hhv-8 encodes viral homolog 
human il-6, called viral il-6 (vil-6), require cellular il-6
receptor binding ubiquitously expressed gp130 receptor subunit and
subsequent jak-stat signaling. thus, contrast il-6, vil-6 stimulate
virtually cells body. elucidate mechanism vil-6 drives
human diseases, generated transgenic mice constitutively express vil-6
under control mhc class promoter. mice found exhibit vil-6
serum levels comparable observed hhv-8-infected patients, to
contain elevated amounts phosphorylated stat3 spleen lymph nodes, where
vil-6 produced, spontaneously develop key features human plasma
cell-type mcd, including splenomegaly, multifocal lymphadenopathy,
hypergammaglobulinemia, plasmacytosis. transfer vil-6 transgene onto
an il-6-deficient genetic background abrogated mcd-like phenotypes, indicating
that endogenous mouse il-6 crucial cofactor natural history the
disease. results mice suggest human il-6 plays important role in
the pathogenesis hhv-8-associated mcd.
