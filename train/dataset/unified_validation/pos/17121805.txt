in cervical cancers, dnas high-risk mucosotropic human papillomaviruses
(hpvs), types 16 18, maintained express two viral
proteins, e6 e7, suggesting play important roles carcinogenesis.

e6-transgenic mouse skin. date, seven pdz domain-containing proteins,
including dlg1/hdlg, human homologue drosophila discs large
tumor suppressor (dlg), identified targets high-risk hpv e6
proteins. here, describe dlg4/psd95, another human homologue dlg, a
novel e6 target. dlg4 found expressed normal human cells, including 
cervical keratinocytes, limited extent hpv-positive and
hpv-negative cervical cancer cell lines. expression hpv18 e6 hck1t

levels restored expression either e6ap-specific short hairpin rna or

downregulation dlg4 mrna opposed protein hpv-independent mechanism
in hpv16-positive cancer lines. tumorigenicity caski cells strongly
inhibited forced expression dlg4, growth culture inhibited
