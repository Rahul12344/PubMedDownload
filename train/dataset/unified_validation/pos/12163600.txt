kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) plays significant role the
development kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, forms of
multicentric castleman's disease. kshv open reading frame k9 encodes the
viral interferon (ifn) factor 1 (virf1), downregulates ifn- and
irf-mediated transcriptional activation, leads cellular transformation 
rodent fibroblasts induction tumors nude mice. using yeast
two-hybrid assay, identified genes associated retinoid-ifn-induced
mortality-19 (grim19), interacts directly virf1, vivo in
vitro. n-terminal region virf1 required binding grim19.
colocalization virf1 grim19 observed 293t cells. virf1 protein 
deregulates grim19-induced apoptosis presence ifn/all-trans-retinoic
acid (ra) inhibits ifn/ra-induced cell death. another dna tumor viral
protein, human papillomavirus type 16 e6, also binds grim19, suggesting this
is general target viral proteins. results collectively indicate that
virf1 modulates ifn/ra-cell death signals via interactions grim19.
