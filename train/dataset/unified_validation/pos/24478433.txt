kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) human gammaherpesvirus
casually linked kaposi's sarcoma (ks), multicentric castleman's disease (mcd),
and primary effusion lymphoma (pel). previously, showed lana encoded by
kshv upregulates expression survivin, member inhibitor apoptosis
(iap) family. leads increase rate cell proliferation of
kshv-infected b cells. lana required tethering kshv episome 
host chromosomes efficiently segregates viral genomes dividing tumor
cells. show lana interacts aurora kinase b (ak-b) induces
phosphorylation survivin residue t34. phosphorylation survivin
specifically residue t34 enhances activity p300 inhibits the
activity histone deacetylase 1 (hdac-1), leads increase in
acetylation histone h3 viral genome. phosphorylation survivin
specifically residue t34 upregulates activities histone
acetyltransferases deacetylases, leads increase viral
copy number kshv-infected b cells. results boost kshv replication
in latently infected b-lymphoma cells. studies showed lana also
function regulate viral replication prior mitosis latently infected 
cells, suggesting lana possesses novel role regulating kshv replication
in infected b cells.importance: work represents report kshv latent
protein lana interactions ak-b leading induction of
phosphorylation oncoprotein survivin residue t34. phosphorylation of
survivin specifically residue t34 upregulates activities histone
acetyltransferases deacetylases. leads increase viral copy
number kshv-infected b cells. studies support role lana in
regulating kshv replication posttranslation modification kshv-infected
b cells.
