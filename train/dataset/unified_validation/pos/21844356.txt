the u(s)3 protein kinase herpes simplex virus 1 plays key role blocking
apoptosis induced viral gene products exogenous agents. u(s)3 protein
kinase similar protein kinase respect substrate range and
specificity. report yeast two-hybrid system domain u(s)3
essential antiapoptotic activity reacted programmed cell death protein 4
(pdcd4). report u(s)3 interacts pdcd4, pdcd4 is
posttranslationally modified infected cells u(s)3-dependent and
-independent fashion, depletion pdcd4 sirna blocked apoptosis
induced δα4 mutant virus. infected cells, pdcd4 accumulates the
nucleus, whereas u(s)3 accumulates cytoplasm. studies designed to
elucidate convergence proteins led discovery u(s)3
protein kinase cycles nucleus cytoplasm u(s)3 retains
pdcd4 infected cell nuclei.
