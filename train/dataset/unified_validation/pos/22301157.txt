the hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna replicates hepatic cells forming a
replication complex lipid raft (detergent-resistant membrane [drm]).
replication complex formation requires various viral nonstructural (ns) proteins 
as well host cellular proteins. previous study (c. k. lai, k. s. jeng, 
k. machida, m. m. lai, j. virol. 82:8838-8848, 2008), found a
cellular protein, annexin a2 (anxa2), interacts ns3/ns4a. since ns3/ns4a 
a membranous protein anxa2 known lipid raft-associated scaffold
protein, postulate anxa2 helps formation hcv replication
complex lipid raft. studies showed anxa2 localized the
hcv-induced membranous web interacted ns4b, ns5a, ns5b and
colocalized perinuclear region. silencing anxa2 decreased
the formation membranous web-like structures viral rna replication.
subcellular fractionation bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis
revealed anxa2 partially associated hcv lipid raft enriched 
with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (pi4p) caveolin-2. further, the
overexpression anxa2 hcv-nonsusceptible hek293 cells caused enrichment 
of hcv ns proteins drm fraction increased colony-forming ability
of hcv replicon. since anxa2 known induce formation lipid
raft microdomain, propose anxa2 recruits hcv ns proteins enriches
them lipid raft form hcv replication complex.
