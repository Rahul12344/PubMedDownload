dendritic cells (dcs) play important role viral infections as
initiators immunity viral targets. interaction dcs the
innate-like cd1d-restricted natural killer (nkt) cells results mutual
activation cells subsequent initiation cellular immune
responses. here, show hiv-1 inhibits surface expression cd1d in
productively infected dcs identify novel activity hiv-1 vpu 
gene product. interestingly, viral protein u (vpu) enhance
constitutive cd1d endocytosis induce rapid cd1d degradation. instead, vpu 
protein interacts cd1d suppresses recycling endosomal
compartments cell surface retaining cd1d early endosomes. this
interference cd1d antigen presentation pathway strongly inhibits the
ability infected dcs activate cd1d-restricted nkt cells. given the
interaction cd1d-expressing dcs central ability nkt cells to
regulate immunity, data suggest interference cd1d antigen
presentation pathway represents hiv-1 strategy evade innate cellular immune
responses imply role innate-like cd1d-restricted nkt cells the
host defense hiv-1.
