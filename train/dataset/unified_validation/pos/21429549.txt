dengue virus (denv) ns1 versatile non-structural glycoprotein is
secreted hexamer, binds cell surface infected uninfected
cells, immune evasive functions. denv ns1 displays two conserved n-linked
glycans n130 n207. study, examined role two
n-linked glycans ns1 secretion, stability, function. groups
have reported reduced yields infectious denv n130 n207 changed,
we analyzed glycosylation-deficient ns1 phenotypes using transgenic expression 
system. show n-linked glycan position 130 required for
stabilization secreted hexamer whereas n-linked glycan residue 207 
facilitates secretion extracellular protein stability. moreover, ns1 mutants 
lacking n-linked glycan n130 interact efficiently complement
components c1s c4. summary, results elucidate contribution of
n-linked glycosylation function denv ns1.
