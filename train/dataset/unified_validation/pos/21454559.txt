merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv) recently described cause 
human merkel cell carcinomas. mcv similar simian virus 40 (sv40) and
encodes nuclear large (lt) oncoprotein usually mutated eliminate
viral replication among tumor-derived mcv. identified hvam6p cytoplasmic
protein involved lysosomal processing novel interactor mcv lt but
not sv40 lt. hvam6p binds clathrin heavy chain homology domain a
unique region mcv lt adjacent retinoblastoma binding site. mcv lt
translocates hvam6p nucleus, sequestering involvement lysosomal
trafficking. naturally occurring, tumor-derived mutant lt (mcv350) lacking a
nuclear localization signal binds hvam6p fails inhibit hvam6p-induced
lysosomal clustering. mcv evolved novel mechanism target hvam6p may
contribute viral uncoating egress lysosomal processing virus
replication.
