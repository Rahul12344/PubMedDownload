integration, one hallmarks retrovirus replication, mediated a
nucleoprotein complex called preintegration complex (pic), viral dna
is associated many protein components required completion of
the early phase infection. striking feature pic powerful
integration activity vitro. pics freshly isolated cytoplasmic
extract infected cells able insert viral dna exogenously added
target dna vitro. therefore, pic-based vitro assay reliable system
for assessing protein factors influencing retroviral integration. study, 
we applied microtiter plate-based vitro assay screening study using a
protein library produced wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis
system. using library human e3 ubiquitin ligases, identified rfpl3 a
potential stimulator human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (hiv-1) pic
integration activity vitro. enhancement pic activity rfpl3 was
likely attributed n-terminal ring domain. understand 
functional role rfpl3 hiv infection, created human cell line
overexpressing rfpl3. immunoprecipitation analysis revealed rfpl3 was
associated human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 pics infected cells. 
more importantly, single-round hiv-1 infection enhanced significantly by
rfpl3 expression. proteomic approach displays advantage the
identification new cellular proteins affecting integration activity the
pic and, therefore, contributes understanding functional interaction
between retroviral integration complexes host factors.
