objectives: viral oncogenes e6 e7 selectively retained expressed in
carcinoma cells infected human papillomavirus type 16 cooperated with
each immortalization transformation primary keratinocytes. this
study performed identify proteins bound modulated high risk
hpv e7 oncogene using proteomics.
methods: hacat normal keratinocyte prepared establish stable cell line
expressing e7. e7-affinity column also prepared obtain e7-interacting 
proteins. order search target molecules modulated e7 expression, 
used 2-dimensional electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time flight (maldi/tof) mass spectrometry. pull down
assay also performed order confirm e7-interacting proteins.
results: identified 28 spots modulated e7 hacat/e7 using
2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-de) maldi/tof mass spectrometry. proteomics 
analyses showed actin leukocyte elastase inhibitor down-regulated, 
whereas stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, cd2 binding protein 1, catalase,
t-complex protein 1, ku70-binding protein, heat shock 60 kda protein 1,
g1/s-specific cyclin e1 peroxiredoxin 2 up-regulated. western blot
revealed heat shock 60 kda protein, catalase peroxiredoxin 2 also
up-regulated. pull assay also showed leukocyte elastase inhibitor (lei)
and ku70-binding protein bound e7 oncoprotein. using e7-affinity
column 2-de/maldi-tof, 22 spots found interact e7 recombinant
protein. mg11-like proteins, livin inhibitor-of-apoptosis, protein serine kinase 
c17, cd2 binding protein 1, cyclin e1, tata box binding protein-associated factor
and uridine-cytidine kinase 2 up-regulated e7 oncogene also bound 
e7 oncoprotein.
conclusions: presumed e7 influence cell status modulating the
factors related cell signaling, apoptosis cell cycle regulation.
