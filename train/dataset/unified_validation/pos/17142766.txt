this study examined ability nine human defensins (hd) protect against
herpes simplex virus infection. noncytotoxic concentrations six
alpha-defensins (hnp1-4, hd5, hd6) human beta-defensin (hbd) 3 inhibited 
hsv infection. two beta-defensins, hbd1 2, lacked protective
activity. synchronized assays revealed hnp-4, hd6, hbd3 acted primarily 
by preventing binding entry, whereas hnp1-3 hd5 also inhibited postentry 
events. even added several hours entry, substantial reduction viral
gene expression ensued. human cervical epithelial cells incubated hnp-1 or
hd5 accumulated peptides intracellularly. surface plasmon resonance studies
revealed hnps 1, 2, 3, hd5 bound hsv glycoprotein b (gb) high
affinity, showed minimal binding heparan sulfate, receptor for
attachment. contrast, hnp-4 hd6 bound heparan sulfate, gb. hbd3
bound gb heparan sulfate, hbd1 hbd2 bound neither. admixture 
hd5 hydroxyethylcellulose significantly protected mice viral
challenge lethal controls receiving inactive peptide or
hydroxyethylcellulose alone. findings demonstrate hds act multiple 
steps hsv life cycle support development defensins or
defensin-like peptides microbicides.
