the ability adenovirus early region proteins, e1b-55k e4orf6, usurp
control cellular ubiquitin ligases target proteins for
proteasome-dependent degradation infection well established. we
show e4 gene product, e4orf3 can, independently e1b-55k e4orf6,
target transcriptional corepressor transcriptional intermediary factor 1γ
(tif1γ) proteasome-mediated degradation infection. initial mass
spectrometric studies identified tif1 family members-tif1α, tif1β, tif1γ-as
e1b-55k-binding proteins transformed infected cells, analyses
revealed that, akin tif1α, tif1γ reorganized e4orf3-dependent manner 
to promyelocytic leukemia protein-containing nuclear tracks infection. the
use number different adenovirus early region mutants identified the
specific sole requirement e4orf3 mediating tif1γ degradation. 
analyses revealed tif1γ targeted degradation number divergent
human adenoviruses, suggesting ability e4orf3 regulate tif1γ
expression evolutionarily conserved. also determined e4orf3 not
utilize cullin-based ubiquitin ligases, crl2 crl5, tif1α ubiquitin
ligase order promote tif1γ degradation. studies suggested that
tif1γ possesses antiviral activity limits adenovirus early late gene
product expression infection. indeed, tif1γ knockdown accelerates the
adenovirus-mediated degradation mre11, tif1γ overexpression delays the
adenovirus-mediated degradation mre11. taken together, studies have
identified novel adenovirus targets established new role the
e4orf3 protein infection.
