infections ebola marburg filoviruses cause rapidly fatal
haemorrhagic fever humans approved antivirals available.
filovirus entry mediated viral spike glycoprotein (gp), attaches 
viral particles cell surface, delivers endosomes catalyses
fusion viral endosomal membranes. additional host factors the
endosomal compartment probably required viral membrane fusion; however,
despite considerable efforts, critical host factors defied molecular
identification. describe genome-wide haploid genetic screen human
cells identify host factors required ebola virus entry. screen
uncovered 67 mutations disrupting six members homotypic fusion and
vacuole protein-sorting (hops) multisubunit tethering complex, involved 
in fusion endosomes lysosomes, 39 independent mutations that
disrupt endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein niemann-pick c1
(npc1). cells defective hops complex npc1 function, including primary 
fibroblasts derived human niemann-pick type c1 disease patients, are
resistant infection ebola virus marburg virus, remain fully
susceptible suite unrelated viruses. show membrane fusion
mediated filovirus glycoproteins viral escape vesicular
compartment require npc1 protein, independent known function in
cholesterol transport. findings uncover unique features entry pathway 
used filoviruses indicate potential antiviral strategies combat these
deadly agents.
