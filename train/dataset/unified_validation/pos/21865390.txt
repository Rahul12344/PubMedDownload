cellular inhibitor apoptosis protein 2 (ciap2) potent suppressor of
apoptotic cell death. shown previously ciap2 involved the
tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-Î±)-induced anti-hepatitis b virus (hbv)
response; however, mechanism antiviral effect remains unclear. in
the present study, demonstrate ciap2 significantly reduce levels 
of hbv dna replication intermediates total viral rna core protein 
levels. domain-mapping analysis revealed carboxy-terminal domains of
ciap2 indispensable anti-hbv ability e3
ligase-deficient mutant ciap2 (termed ciap2*) completely lost antiviral
activity. identified hbv polymerase target ciap2.
overexpression ciap2 ciap2* reduced polymerase protein levels, while
ciap2 knockdown increased polymerase expression. addition, observed that
ciap2 promoted degradation viral polymerase a
proteasome-dependent pathway. experiments demonstrated ciap2 can
bind polymerase promote polyubiquitylation. finally, found that
ciap2 downregulated encapsidation hbv pregenomic rna. taken together,
these data reveal novel mechanism inhibition hbv replication by
ciap2 via acceleration ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated decay polymerase
and reduction encapsidation hbv pregenomic rna, making mechanism a
novel strategy hbv therapy.
