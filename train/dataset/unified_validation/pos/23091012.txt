infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) promotes development hepatitis,
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) leading cause morbidity
and mortality worldwide. hbv x protein (hbx) important effector hbv
pathogenesis, cellular targets acting mechanisms remain elusive. we
show hbx interacts anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 bcl-xl
through bcl-2 homology 3 (bh3)-like motif mammalian cells. importantly,
mutations bh3-like motif prevent hbx binding bcl-2 bcl-xl
abrogate cytosolic calcium elevation cell death induced hbx expression 
hepatocytes severely impair hbv viral replication, substantially
rescued restoring cytosolic calcium. results suggest hbx binding to
bcl-2 family members subsequent elevation cytosolic calcium important 
for hbv viral replication. consistently, rnai knockdown bcl-2 bcl-xl
results reduced calcium elevation hbx decreased viral replication in
hepatocytes. results suggest hbx targets bcl-2 proteins its
bh3-like motif promote cytosolic calcium elevation, cell death, viral
replication hbv pathogenesis, presents excellent therapeutic
intervention point treating patients chronic hbv.
