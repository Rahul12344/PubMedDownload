not individuals exposed hiv-1 become infected, evidence hiv-1
highly exposed seronegative women (hiv-1-resistant) suggests mucosal factors
in female genital tract, first site contact virus, playing
a role. better understand factors mediating protection hiv-1, we
performed large clinical study using tools systems biology fully
characterize cervicovaginal mucosa proteome hiv-1-resistant women.
cervicovaginal lavage fluid collected 293 hiv-1-resistant, uninfected,
and infected sex workers analyzed 2d-lc ltq-ft-ms. 360
unique proteins identified, 41 differentially abundant (>3-fold cutoff) in
hiv-1-resistant women. majority over-abundant proteins antiproteases 
(>40%), described anti-inflammatory anti-hiv-1 activity.
quantification specific anti-hiv-1 antiproteases serpin a1, serpin a3, and
cystatin b epithelial antiprotease a2ml1 found significantly
over-abundant hiv-1-resistant women (p = 0.004; p = 0.046; p = 0.0003; p =
0.04, respectively). expression levels correlated sexual practices or
other epidemiological factors. mucosal antiprotease levels correlated with
pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration (p = <0.0001), independently of
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels hiv-1-resistant women including tnf-alpha,
il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, il-8. comprehensive systems biology
approach identifies mucosal serpins cystatins novel correlates of
hiv-1-resistance. represents first study characterizing factors in
the female genital tract.
