the epstein-barr virus (ebv) c promoter (cp) regulates several genes required for
b-cell proliferation latent ebv infection. family repeats (fr) region
of latent origin plasmid replication (orip) functions epstein-barr
nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1)-dependent distant enhancer cp activity, the
enhancer-promoter interaction mediated higher-order multi-protein complex
containing several copies ebna1. using dna-affinity purification 170 bp
region cp combination mass spectrometry, identified cell
cycle-regulatory protein e2f1, e2f-binding protein arid3a, the
b-cell-specific transcription factor oct-2 components multi-protein
complex. binding three factors fr region orip determined 
dna-affinity immunoblot analysis. co-immunoprecipitation proximity
ligation analysis revealed three factors, e2f1, arid3a oct-2,
interact well ebna1 nuclei ebv-positive
cells. using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, showed e2f1 and
oct-2 interacted fr part orip cp, arid3a interaction 
was, however, detected cp. findings support hypothesis that
ebna1 initiates transcription cp via interactions multiple ebna1
homodimers cellular transcription factors large molecular machinery that
forms dynamic interaction cp fr.
