human papillomaviruses (hpvs) cause benign malignant epithelial tumors the
respiratory genital mucosa. previously reported recurrent respiratory
papillomas caused hpv 6/11 express low levels antibody-detectable tap-1,
the protein transports peptides endoplasmic reticulum assembly 
and presentation mhc class i, extent tap-1 immunostaining is
inversely related frequency disease recurrence. determined 
a mechanism reduction tap-1 detection. anti-tap-1 antibody
immunoprecipitated low amounts protein papilloma cells. however,
immunoprecipitation calreticulin, another member mhc assembly
complex, coprecipitated tap-1 levels comparable uninfected cells. 
immunoprecipitation hpv-positive cell line either anti-tap-1 or
anti-calreticulin coprecipitated hpv e7 protein. finally, purified hpv 11 e7
protein inhibited atp-dependent peptide transport vitro. propose the
interaction e7 tap-1 prevents tap-1 antibody detection efficient
peptide transport, resulting poor presentation viral antigen on
hpv-infected cells thus failure mount effective immune-mediated
prevention disease recurrence.
