sindbis virus (sinv) prototype member alphavirus genus, whose
members cause severe human diseases specific treatment. 
ascertain host factors important replication sinv rna genome, we
generated sinv expressing nsp4, viral rna-dependent rna polymerase, an
in-frame 3xflag epitope tag. proteomic analysis nsp4-containing complexes
isolated cells infected tagged virus revealed 29 associated host
proteins. these, 10 proteins associated later time infection
(12 h), 14 associated early late, five isolated at
the earlier time (6 h postinfection). results demonstrate dynamic
nature virus-host interaction occurs course infection and
suggest different host proteins may required multiple functions
carried nsp4. two related proteins found association nsp4 
times infection, gtpase-activating protein (sh3 domain) binding protein 1
(g3bp1) g3bp2 also previously identified associated sinv nsp2
and nsp3. demonstrate likely overlapping role host factors in
limiting sinv replication events. present study also identifies 10 host
factors associated nsp4 6 h infection found be
associated nsp2 nsp3. factors candidates playing important 
roles rna replication process. identifying host factors essential for
replication lead new strategies interrupt alphavirus replication.
