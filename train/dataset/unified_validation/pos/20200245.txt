the role epigenetic modifications regulation gammaherpesvirus
latency subject active study 20 years. dna
methylation, associated transcriptional silencing mammalian genomes, 
been shown important mechanism transcriptional control several
key gammaherpesvirus genes. particular, dna methylation functionally
conserved immediate-early replication transcription activator (rta) 
shown regulate epstein-barr virus kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus 
rta expression. demonstrate murine gammaherpesvirus (mhv68)
homolog, encoded gene 50, also subject direct repression dna
methylation, vitro vivo. observed treatment of
latently mhv68-infected b-cell lines methyltransferase inhibitor induced
virus reactivation. addition, show methylation recently
characterized distal gene 50 promoter represses activity murine macrophage
cell line. evaluate role de novo methyltransferases (dnmts) the
establishment methylation marks, infected mice conditional
dnmt3a dnmt3b alleles selectively deleted b lymphocytes.
dnmt3a/dnmt3b-deficient b cells phenotypically normal, displaying obvious
compromise cell surface marker expression antibody production either in
na√Øve mice context nonviral viral immunogens. however, mice
lacking functional dnmt3a dnmt3b b cells exhibited hallmarks of
deregulated mhv68 lytic replication, including increased splenomegaly the
presence infectious virus spleen day 18 following infection. in
addition, total gene 50 transcript levels elevated spleens these
mice day 18, correlated hypomethylation distal gene 50
promoter. however, day 42 postinfection, aberrant virus replication was
resolved, observed wild-type frequencies viral genome-positive
splenocytes mice lacking functional dnmt3a dnmt3b b lymphocytes. the
latter correlated increased cpg methylation distal gene 50 promoter, 
which restored levels similar littermate controls harboring
functional dnmt3a dnmt3b alleles b lymphocytes, suggesting existence
of alternative mechanism de novo methylation mhv68 genome.
importantly, dnmt3a/dnmt3b-independent methylation appeared targeted
specifically gene 50 promoter, observed promoters mhv68
gene 72 (v-cyclin) m11 (v-bcl2) remained hypomethylated day 42
postinfection. taken together, data provide first evidence the
importance dna methylation regulating gammaherpesvirus rta/gene 50
transcription virus infection vivo provide insight the
hierarchy host machinery required establish modification.
