influenza virus rna polymerase composed three virus-coded proteins, 
involved transcription replication negative-strand genome rna.
subunit pb1 plays key roles rna polymerase assembly catalytic
function rna polymerization. using yeast two-hybrid screening, hela cell
protein molecular mass 45 kda identified. cloning and
sequencing, protein identified ebp1, erbb3-binding protein. epb1
specifically interacts pb1 vitro vivo, epb1 contact site 
on pb1 mapped binding site transcription primers. ebp1 found to
interfere vitro rna synthesis influenza virus rna polymerase (3p
complex), inhibition observed capped rna endonuclease rna-cap 
binding, intrinsic activities rna polymerase. since inhibition not
observed nucleic acid polymerases tested, propose ebp1 a
selective inhibitor influenza viral rna polymerase. accordingly
over-expression ebp1 interfered virus production. pb1-contact site on
ebp1 overlaps interaction site erbb3 (epidermal receptor tyrosine
kinase), androgen receptor (ar) retinoblastoma gene product (rb), are
involved controlling cell proliferation differentiation.
