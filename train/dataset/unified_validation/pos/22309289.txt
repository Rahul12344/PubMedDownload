hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) putative viral oncoprotein plays an
important role various cellular processes, including modulation the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt signalling pathway. however, molecular
mechanism akt activation remains elusive. show hbx interacts with
akt1 kinase phosphorylated serine 31 indicated mutational
analysis akt recognition motif (creating hbxs31a mutant) or
immunoblotting hbx immunoprecipitates using akt motif-specific antibody. the
akt-dependent phosphorylation hbx abrogated presence the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor ly294002 akt1 gene silencing by
specific sirna. co-immunoprecipitation studies provided evidence hbx-akt
interaction cellular environment. interaction also confirmed in
hepatoma hepg2.2.15 cells hbx expressed physiological levels from
the integrated hepatitis b viral genome. hbx-akt interaction essential
for akt signalling, involved displacement akt-bound negative regulator
'c-terminal modulator protein' hbx. hbx-activated akt phosphorylated its
downstream target glycogen synthase kinase 3β, leading stabilization of
β-catenin, p65 phosphorylation resulted enhanced promoter recruitment
and expression target genes encoding cyclin d1 bcl-xl. further, the
oncogenic potential hbx significantly augmented presence akt 
a soft agar colony formation assay. together, results suggest that
oncogenic co-operation hbx akt may important cell
proliferation, abrogation apoptosis tumorigenic transformation cells.
