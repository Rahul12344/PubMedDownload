all gammaherpsviruses encode least one gene related cellular
formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (fgarat) enzyme their
biological roles relatively unknown. murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (mhv68)
vfgarat, orf75c, mediates proteasome-dependent degradation antiviral
promyelocytic leukemia (pml) protein unknown mechanism, addressed 
in study. found orf75c interacts weakly pml sumo-modified
forms pml important degradation orf75c. orf75c-mediated pml
degradation dependent two known cellular regulators pml stability, 
casein kinase ii (ck2) human papilloma virus e6-associated protein (e6ap).
finally, orf75c self-ubiquitination activity vitro expression
increased levels ubiquitinated pml transfected cells. taken together, the
evidence accumulated study provides new insights function a
vfgarat consistent model orf75c could mediate direct
ubiquitination pml resulting degradation proteasome.
