adenovirus (ad) replicative complexes form discrete sites nuclear
matrix (nm) via interaction mediated precursor terminal protein 
(ptp). identities cellular proteins involved complexes have
remained obscure. present evidence ptp binds multifunctional
pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme found replication domains nm.
far-western blotting identified proteins 150 240 kda ptp binding 
activity. amino acid sequencing 150-kda band revealed sequence identity to
carbamyl phosphate synthetase (cps i) high degree homology the
related trifunctional enzyme known cad (for carbamyl phosphate synthetase,
aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase). western blotting an
antibody directed cad detected 240-kda band comigrated that
detected ptp far-western blotting. binding experiments showed ptp-cad
complex immunoprecipitable cell extracts ptp expressed a
vaccinia virus recombinant. additionally, vitro-translated epitope-tagged ptp 
and cad immunoprecipitable complex, indicating occurrence a
protein-protein interaction. confocal fluorescence microscopy ad-infected nm
showed ptp cad colocalized nuclear foci. ptp cad were
confirmed colocalize active sites replication detected by
bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. data support concept ptp-cad 
interaction may allow anchorage ad replication complexes proximity of
required cellular factors may help segregate replicated unreplicated
viral dna.
