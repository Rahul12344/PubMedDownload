background: primary infection human host, herpes simplex virus
type-1 (hsv-1) establishes latency neurons viral genome is
maintained circular form associated nucleosomes chromatin
configration. latency, viral genes silenced, although the
molecular mechanisms responsible unclear. hypothesized that
neuronal factors repress hsv-1 gene expression latency. search the
hsv-1 dna sequence potential regulatory elements identified repressor
element-1/neuronal restrictive silencer element (re-1/nrse) located hsv-1
genes icp22 icp4. predicted repressor element silencing
transcription factor/neuronal restrictive silencer factor (rest/nrsf) regulates
expression icp22 icp4.
results: transient cotransfection indicated rest/nrsf inhibited activity
of promoters. contrast, cotransfection mutant form rest/nrsf
encoding dna-binding domain protein resulted less inhibition. 
stably transformed cell lines containing episomal reporter plasmids a
chromatin structure showed rest/nrsf specifically inhibited icp4
promoter, icp22 promoter. rest/nrsf inhibition icp4 promoter
was reversed histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor trichostatin (tsa).
additionally, chromatin immuno-precipitation (chip) assays indicated the
corepressor corest recruited proximity icp4 promoter that
acetylation histone h4 reduced presence rest/nrsf.
conclusion: since icp4 protein key transactivator hsv-1 lytic cycle
genes, results suggest rest/nrsf may important role the
establishment and/or maintenance hsv-1 gene silencing latency by
targeting icp4 expression.
