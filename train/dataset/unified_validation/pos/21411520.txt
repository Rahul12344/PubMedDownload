bluetongue virus (btv), member reoviridae family, insect-borne
animal pathogen. virus release infected cells predominantly cell
lysis, btv particles also released plasma membrane. the
nonstructural protein ns3 implicated process. using alternate
initiator methionine residues, ns3 expressed full-length protein a
truncated variant lacks initial 13 residues, which, yeast-two hybrid 
analyses, shown interact cellular trafficking protein

virus-infected cells, used reverse genetics investigate roles of

virus expressing ns3a severely attenuated, although protein expression, 
replication, double-stranded rna (dsrna) synthesis, particle assembly

however, wild-type particles found within cytoplasmic vesicles in
insect cells, mutant viruses scattered throughout cytoplasm not
confined vesicles. results provide support role extreme

plausibly egress. however, ns3 ns3a required efficient btv
