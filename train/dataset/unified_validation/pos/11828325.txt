cyclin herpesvirus saimiri (vcyclin) preferentially forms complexes with
cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (cdk6) primate host cells. complexes show
higher kinase activity host cell cdks complex cellular cyclins and
are resistant cyclin-dependent inhibitory proteins (cdkis). crystal
structure human cdk6--vcyclin active state determined 3.1 a
resolution better understand structural basis cdk6 activation viral 
cyclins. unphosphorylated cdk6 complex vcyclin many features
characteristic cyclina-activated, phosphorylated cdk2. are, however,
differences conformation tip t-loop interactions
with vcyclin. residues n-terminal extension vcyclin wrap around tip
of cdk6 t-loop form short beta-sheet t-loop backbone. these
interactions lead 20% larger buried surface cdk6--vcyclin interface
than cdk2--cyclina complex probably largely responsible the
specificity vcyclin cdk6 resistance complex inhibition by
ink-type cdkis.
