repulsive signaling semaphorins plexins crucial development and
homeostasis nervous, immune, cardiovascular systems. sema7a acts as
both immune neural semaphorin plexinc1, a39r sema7a
mimic secreted smallpox virus. report structures sema7a a39r
complexed semaphorin-binding module plexinc1. structures show
two plexinc1 molecules symmetrically bridged semaphorin dimers, the
semaphorin plexinc1 beta propellers interact edge-on, orthogonal
orientation. binding interfaces dominated insertion the
semaphorin's 4c-4d loop deep groove blade 3 plexinc1 propeller. 
a39r appears achieve sema7a mimicry preserving key plexin-binding
determinants seen mammalian sema7a complex evolved achieve
higher affinity binding host-derived plexinc1. complex structures
support conserved semaphorin-plexin recognition mode suggest plexins
are activated dimerization.
