the adenovirus e1a proteins activate c-jun promoter two
jun/atf-binding sites, jun1 jun2. p300, transcriptional coactivator of
several ap1 atf transcription factors postulated play role in
this activation. here, present evidence p300 control c-jun
transcription acting cofactor atf2: (1) over-expression p300 was
found stimulate c-jun transcription presence absence e1a.
(2) like e1a, p300 activates c-jun promoter junl jun2
elements preferentially activates n-terminal domain atf2. (3)
co-immunoprecipitation assays crude cell extracts indicate endogenous
p300/cbp(-like) proteins atf2 proteins present multiprotein complex 
that bind specifically jun2 element. demonstrate the
stress-activated-protein-kinase (sapk) target sites atf2, thr69 thr71 
not required formation p300/cbp-atf2 multiprotein complex. these
data indicate e1a inhibit transcription activation functions of
p300, and, fact, cooperates p300 activation atf2
n-terminus.
