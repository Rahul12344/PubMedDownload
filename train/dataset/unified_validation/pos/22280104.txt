in earlier studies provided evidence vaccinia virus (vacv)
phosphorylation-activation host cell signaling effectors critical for
subsequent viral replication. report, using mass spectrometry-based
proteomics, identified 387 host cell proteins co-immunoprecipitate
with vacv infected, permissive pm1.ccr5 human cells. among these, glomulin
was distinguishable based known interaction tyrosine kinase
receptor, c-met, ability become tyrosine-phosphorylated, its
association signaling effectors. sirna knockdown glomulin expression in
pm1.ccr5 cells reduces vacv infection. glomulin interacts inactive,
nonphosphorylated form c-met. demonstrate treatment pm1.ccr5 t
cells c-met phosphorylation inhibitor leads significant reduction 
vacv infectivity. additionally, inhibition phosphorylation c-met abrogates 
vacv-inducible phosphorylation erk 1/2 irs-2, signaling effectors
identified critical vacv infection. data identify glomulin a
permissivity factor vacv infection potential therapeutic target 
inhibition vacv infection.
