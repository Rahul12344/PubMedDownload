in light scarcity reports interaction hsv-1 nucleocapsid
protein ul25 host cell proteins, purpose study use
yeast two-hybrid screening search cellular proteins interact with
the ul25 protein. c9orf69, protein unknown function identified. the
interaction two proteins physiological conditions also
confirmed biological experiments including co-localization fluorescence and
immunoprecipitation. preliminary study function c9orf69 showed that
it promotes viral proliferation. studies showed c9orf69 not
influence viral multiplication efficiency transcriptional regulation viral 
genes, indirectly promoted proliferation via interaction ul25.
