epstein-barr virus (ebv) bglf4 member conserved herpesvirus kinases
that regulate multiple cellular viral substrates play important role
in viral lytic cycles. bglf4 found phosphorylate several cellular
and viral transcription factors, modulate activities, regulate
downstream events. study, identify nf-κb coactivator, uxt, a
substrate bglf4. bglf4 downregulates nf-κb transactivation in
reporter assays response tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) poly(i·c) 
stimulation, also nf-κb-regulated cellular gene expression. furthermore,
bglf4 attenuates nf-κb-mediated repression ebv lytic transactivators, zta 
and rta. ebv-positive na cells, knockdown bglf4 lytic progression
elevates nf-κb activity downregulates activity ebv orilyt bhlf1
promoter, first promoter activated upon lytic switch. show that
bglf4 phosphorylates uxt thr3 residue. modification interferes with
the interaction uxt nf-κb. data also indicate bglf4 reduces 
the interaction uxt nf-κb attenuates nf-κb enhanceosome activity.
upon infection short hairpin rna (shrna) lentivirus knock uxt, a
spontaneous lytic cycle observed na cells, suggesting uxt required 
maintenance ebv latency. overexpression wild-type, not
phosphorylation-deficient, uxt enhances expression lytic proteins 
control uxt knockdown cells. taking data together, transcription
involving uxt may also important ebv lytic protein expression, whereas
bglf4-mediated phosphorylation uxt thr3 plays critical role promoting 
the lytic cycle.
