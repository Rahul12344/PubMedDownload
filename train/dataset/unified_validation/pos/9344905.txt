hiv-1 nef protein important pathogenicity, biochemical function
remains obscure. clarify role, yeast two-hybrid system (ths) screening
was utilized identify nef cellular partners. 79 yeast clones harboring
cdnas putative nef binding proteins, 27 (34%) contained coding region for
hsn3 proteasomal subunit. hsn3 behaved bona fide nef partner ths control
crosses. nef-hsn3 interaction confirmed vitro binding experiments. in
particular, recombinant nef able capture hsn3 subunit natural
proteasome preparation. nef, interacting region mapped within aa
34-143, span structured portion protein, including the
sh3-binding domain. hsn3, nef-binding portion restricted aa 73-249, and
the tract 219-249-reminiscent sh3 domain n-terminal 3/5ths-was shown be
essential, though sufficient. attempts purify nef-hsn3 complex from
transfected cos7 cells unsuccessful. however, nef found markedly
downregulate intracellular levels coexpressed hsn3 endogenous
simian homologue. results suggest nef, binding subunit, might 
alter proteasome function infected cells.
