it well established hcv ns5a protein expressed mammalian cells
perturbs extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk) pathway. protein
serine/threonine phosphatase 2a controls phosphorylation numerous proteins
involved cell signaling one characterized function regulation of
ras-raf mitogen activated protein (map) kinase signaling pathways. results
showed expression hcv ns5a protein stimulates phosphatase 2a (pp2a)
activity cells, indicating relevance ns5a regulator pp2a in
vivo. found transient expression full length ns5a protein in
different cell lines leads significant increase pp2a activity and
this activity specifically inhibited addition okadaic acid, pp2a
inhibitor, living cells. investigation showed ns5a protein
interacts vivo vitro scaffolding catalytic c
subunits pp2a. propose hcv ns5a represents viral pp2a regulatory
protein. novel function ns5a protein may key role 
in ability virus deregulate cell growth survival.
