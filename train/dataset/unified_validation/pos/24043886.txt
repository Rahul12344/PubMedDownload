although women constitute half hiv-1-infected people worldwide (unaids
world aids day report, 2011), earliest events female reproductive
tract (frt) heterosexual hiv-1 transmission poorly understood.
recently, demonstrated hiv-1 could directly impair mucosal epithelial
barrier frt. suggested hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 was
being recognized membrane receptor genital epithelial cells, leading to
innate immune activation. study, report pattern-recognition
receptors tlr2 -4 bind hiv-1 gp120 trigger proinflammatory cytokine
production via activation nf-Îºb. gp120-tlr interaction also required the
presence heparan sulfate (hs). bead-binding assays showed gp120 bind 
to hs, tlr2, tlr4, studies transfected hek293 cells demonstrated 
hs tlr2 -4 necessary mediate downstream signaling. exposure to
seminal plasma hiv-1-infected uninfected men gp120 added it
induced significant proinflammatory cytokine response genital epithelial
cells disruption tight junctions, indicating role gp120 mucosal
barrier disruption hiv-1 heterosexual transmission. studies provide,
for first time knowledge, possible mechanism hiv-1 gp120
could directly initiate innate immune activation frt heterosexual
transmission.
