the role glutathione (gsh) vitro infection replication human 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) investigated. intracellular endogenous
gsh levels dramatically decreased first 24 h virus adsorption,
starting immediately virus challenge. addition exogenous gsh not
only able restore intracellular levels almost found in
uninfected cells, also inhibit > 99% replication hsv-1. this
inhibition concentration-dependent, related toxic effects host
cells also maintained exogenous gsh added late 24 h after
virus challenge, i.e. virus infection fully established. electron
microscopic examination hsv-1-infected cells showed gsh dramatically
reduced number extracellular intracytoplasmic virus particles, whereas
some complete nucleocapsids still detected within nuclei gsh-treated 
cells. consistent observation, immunoblot analysis showed the
expression hsv-1-glycoprotein b, crucial release infectivity
of virus particles, significantly decreased. data suggest exogenous gsh 
inhibits replication hsv-1 interfering late stages the
virus life cycle, without affecting cellular metabolism.
