the human scavenger receptor gp340 identified binding protein for
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope expressed the
cell surface female genital tract epithelial cells. interaction allows
such epithelial cells efficiently transmit infective virus susceptible
targets maintain viral infectivity several days. within context of
vaginal transmission, hiv must first traverse normally protective mucosa
containing cell barrier reach underlying cells dendritic cells,
which propagate spread infection. mechanism hiv-1 bypass
an otherwise healthy cellular barrier remains important area study. here,
we demonstrate genital tract-derived cell lines primary human
endocervical tissue support direct transcytosis cell-free virus the
apical basolateral surfaces. further, transport virus blocked
through addition antibodies peptides directly block the
interaction gp340 hiv-1 envelope, added prior viral pulsing 
the apical side cell tissue barrier. data support role the
previously described heparan sulfate moieties mediating transcytosis 
add gp340 important facilitator hiv-1 transcytosis across genital tract 
tissue. study demonstrates hiv-1 actively traverses protective
barriers human genital tract presents second mechanism whereby gp340
can promote heterosexual transmission.
