papillomavirus dna replication occurs nucleus infected cells and
requires viral e1 protein, enters nuclei host epithelial cells
and carries enzymatic functions required initiation viral dna
replication. study, investigated pathway regulation the
nuclear import e1 protein bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv1). using 
an vitro binding assay, determined e1 protein interacted with
importins alpha3, alpha4, alpha5 via nuclear localization signal (nls)
sequence. agreement result, purified e1 protein effectively
imported nucleus digitonin-permeabilized hela cells incubation 
with importin alpha3, alpha4, alpha5 necessary import factors. we
also observed vitro binding e1 protein three alpha importins
was significantly decreased introduction pseudophosphorylation
mutations nls region. consistent binding defect,
pseudophosphorylated e1 protein failed enter nucleus of
digitonin-permeabilized hela cells vitro. likewise, pseudophosphorylation 
mutant showed aberrant intracellular localization vivo accumulated
primarily nuclear envelope transfected hela cells, the
corresponding alanine replacement mutant displayed cellular location
pattern wild-type e1 protein. collectively, data demonstrate bpv1 e1 
protein transported nucleus one importin alpha and
suggest e1 phosphorylation host cell kinases plays regulatory role in
modulating e1 nucleocytoplasmic localization. phosphoregulation nuclear
e1 protein uptake may contribute coordination viral replication with
keratinocyte proliferation differentiation.
