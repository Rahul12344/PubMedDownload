the mechanism budding influenza virus revealed important deviation from
the consensus mechanism budding retroviruses growing number of
negative-strand rna viruses. study focused role influenza a
virus matrix protein m1 virus release. found mutation proline
residue position 16 matrix protein induces inhibition virus
detachment cells. depletion m1-binding protein rack1 also impairs
virus release rack1 binding requires proline residue position 16 of
m1. impaired m1-rack1 interaction affect plasma membrane binding
of m1; contrast, rack1 recruited detergent-resistant membranes a
m1-proline-16-dependent manner. proline-16 mutation m1 depletion of
rack1 impairs pinching-off budding virus particles. findings
reveal active role viral matrix protein release influenza 
virus particles involves cross-talk rack1-mediated pathway.
