positive-sense rna viruses, dengue virus (denv), hijack intracellular
membrane machinery replication. rab18 protein, member 
rab gtpase family, key regulators membrane trafficking, located the
organelles involved denv infection, endoplasmic reticulum (er) and
lipid droplets (lds). study, addressed potential involvement of
rab18 denv infection using cells overexpressing wild-type, gtp-bound
active form, gdp-bound inactive form rab18 cells rab18 knockdown. 
denv replication, measured viral protein, viral rna, viral progeny
production, well ld induction, reduced cells inactive rab18 and
in cells deprived rab18 expression, suggesting positive role rab18 the
denv life cycle. interestingly, interaction fatty acid synthase (fasn), 
key lipogenic enzyme lipid biosynthesis, denv ns3 protein relied the
conversion gdp-bound gtp-bound form rab18. furthermore, the
targeting fasn sites participating denv infection, er and
lds, depends functional rab18. thus, rab18-mediated membrane trafficking of
fasn ns3 facilitates denv replication, probably ensuring sufficient 
coordinated lipid supply membrane proliferation arrangement.importance:
infection dengue virus (denv), important mosquito-borne virus threatening
∼40% world's population, cause mild dengue fever severe dengue
hemorrhagic fever dengue shock syndrome. pathogenesis mechanisms of
denv-related diseases clear, high viral replication believed be
a risk factor severe form denv infection. thus, understanding the
detailed mechanism denv replication might help address devastating virus.
here, found rab18, small gtpase involved vesicle trafficking and
located endoplasmic reticulum network surfaces lipid
droplets, positively regulates denv replication. functional machinery of
rab18 required recruit enzyme fatty acid synthase sites denv
replication interact denv ns3 protein promote fatty acid
biosynthesis. thus, denv usurps rab18 facilitate replication.
