kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) cause kaposi's sarcoma
and body cavity lymphomas. kshv lytic infection produces pan rna, highly
abundant noncoding polyadenylated transcript retained nucleus. 
recently demonstrated pan rna interacts several viral cellular
factors disregulate expression genes modulate immune
response. effort define role pan rna context virus 
genome generated recombinant bacmid deleted pan rna locus. 
of apparent duplication pan rna locus bac36, generated bac36cr, 
a recombinant bacmid removes duplicated region. bac36cr used a
template delete pan rna locus generate bac36crδpan. bac36crδpan
failed produce supernatant virus displayed general decrease mrna
accumulation representative immediate early, early late genes. most
strikingly, k-rta expression decreased lytically induced
bac36crδpan-containing cell lines early late time points post induction.
expression pan rna trans bac36crδpan containing cells resulted an
increase k-rta expression, however k-rta expression failed rescue
bac36crδpan, suggesting pan rna plays wider role virus replication. 
investigate role pan rna activation k-rta expression, we
demonstrate pan rna physically interacts orf50 promoter. rna
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show pan rna interacts with
demethylases jmjd3 utx, histone methyltransferase mll2. consistent
with interaction demethylases, expression pan rna results a
decrease repressive h3k27me3 mark orf50 promoter. data
support model pan rna multifunctional regulatory transcript that
controls kshv gene expression mediating modification chromatin by
targeting kshv repressed genome.
