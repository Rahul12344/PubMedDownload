we demonstrated previously core protein hepatitis c virus (hcv) 
exhibits suppression activity gene expression replication hepatitis b
virus (hbv). elucidated suppression mechanism hcv core
protein. demonstrated hcv core protein retained inhibitory effect 
hbv gene expression replication expressed part full length 
hcv polyprotein. based substitution mutational analysis, results
suggested mutation introduced bipartite nuclear localization signal
of hcv core protein resulted cytoplasmic localization core protein 
but affect suppression ability hbv gene expression. mutational
studies also indicated almost dibasic residue mutations within the
n-terminal 101-amino acid segment hcv core protein (except
arg(39)-arg(40)) impaired suppression activity hbv replication hbv
gene expression. integrity arg residues positions 101, 113, 114, and
115 found essential suppressive effects, whereas arg
residue position 104 important suppression hbv gene
expression. moreover, results indicated suppression hbv gene
expression mediated direct interaction hcv core protein with
the trans-activator hbx protein, whereas suppression hbv replication
involved complex formation hbv polymerase (pol) hcv core
protein, resulting structural incompetence hbv pol bind the
package signal consequently abolished formation hbv virion.
altogether, study suggests two suppression effects hbv
elicited hcv core protein likely depend different structural context
but nuclear localization core protein, two effects be
decoupled revealed differential targets (hbx hbv pol) two
processes hbv life cycle.
