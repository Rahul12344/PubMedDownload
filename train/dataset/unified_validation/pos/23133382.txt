genomic dna replication universal essential process herpesvirus 
including human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). hcmv ul70 protein, believed to
encode primase activity viral dna replication machinery highly 
conserved among herpesviruses, needs localized nucleus, site 
viral dna synthesis. host factors facilitate nuclear import ul70
have reported. study, provided first direct evidence that
ul70 specifically interacts highly conserved ubiquitously expressed
member heat shock protein hsp40/dnaj family, dnajb6, expressed as
two isoforms, b, result alternative splicing. interaction of
ul70 common region dnajb6a b identified two hybrid
screen yeast coimmunoprecipitation human cells. transfected cells,
ul70 primarily co-localized dnajb6a nuclei dnajb6b in
the cytoplasm, respectively. nuclear import ul70 increased cells in
which dnajb6a up-regulated dnajb6b down-regulated, reduced 
cells dnajb6a down-regulated dnajb6b up-regulated.
furthermore, level viral dna synthesis progeny production was
increased cells dnajb6a up-regulated dnajb6b was
down-regulated, reduced cells dnajb6a down-regulated or
dnajb6b up-regulated. thus, dnajb6a b appear enhance nuclear
import cytoplasmic accumulation ul70, respectively. results also
suggest relative expression levels dnajb6 isoforms may play key
role regulating cellular localization ul70, leading modulation of
hcmv dna synthesis lytic infection.
