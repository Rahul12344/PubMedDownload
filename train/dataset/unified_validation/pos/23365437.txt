it generally accepted that, following primary infection, human cytomegalovirus
(hcmv) establishes lifelong latency cd34(+) progenitor cells other
derivative cells myeloid lineage. study, show viral
ul144 gene expressed latent infection two cell types myeloid 
lineage, cd34(+) cd14(+) monocytes, ul144 protein functional 
in latently infected monocytes. however, latency-associated expression of
ul144 occurs certain isolates hcmv depends presence of
functional gata-2 transcription factor binding sites ul144 promoter, in
contrast viral latency-associated gene luna, also show is
regulated gata-2 expressed uniformly latent infection independent
of virus isolate. taken together, data suggest hcmv
latency-associated transcriptome may virus isolate specific dependent on
the repertoire transcription factor binding sites promoters of
latency-associated genes.
