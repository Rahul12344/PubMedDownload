precise regulation innate immunity crucial maintaining optimal immune
responses infections. whereas positive regulation ifn signaling
elicits rapid type ifns, negative regulation equally important preventing
the production superfluous ifns hazardous host. the
positive regulators ifn pathway known main targets viruses to
antagonize innate immune system. whether viruses target negative
regulators ifn pathway remains fully investigated. study, we
report structural protein vp2 human bocavirus modulates ifn pathway
by targeting ring finger protein 125 (rnf125), negative regulator type i
ifn signaling, conjugates lys(48)-linked ubiquitination retinoic
acid-inducible gene-i (rig-i) subsequently leads proteasome-dependent 
degradation rig-i. vp2 upregulated sendai virus (sev)-induced ifnb
promoter activity, also enhanced sev-induced ifn-β production mrna
and protein levels. agreement, level ser(396)-phosphorylated ifn
regulatory factor 3 stimulated sev enhanced presence vp2.
furthermore, vp2 demonstrated physically interact rnf125, resulting
in reduction rnf125-mediated ubiquitination proteasome-dependent
degradation rig-i. additional study indicated endogenous rig-i
degradation decreased vp2-expressing cells. study delineates unique 
phenomenon aberrant activation ifn regulatory factor 3 pathway may
represent new mechanism underlying viral manipulation host immune
system.
