tax1, potent activator human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1)
transcription, shown modulate expression many cellular genes. tax1
does bind dna directly regulates transcription protein-protein
interactions sequence-specific transcription factors. using yeast
two-hybrid system screen proteins interact tax1, isolated
the b subunit ccaat binding protein nf-y hela cdna library. the
interaction tax1 nf-yb specific nf-yb interact a
variety transcription factors, including human immunodeficiency virus
tat, human papillomavirus e6, bicoid, m7 (amino acids 29cp-as)
tax1 mutant. however, nf-yb interact c-terminal tax1 mutants m22
(130tl-as) m47 (319ll-rs). also show vitro-translated nf-yb
specifically bound glutathione s-transferase-tax1 fusion protein. further,
tax1 coimmunoprecipitated nf-y nuclear extracts htlv-1-transformed
cells, providing evidence vivo interaction tax1 nf-yb. further
demonstrate tax1 specifically activated nf-y-responsive dqbeta promoter,
as well minimal promoter contains y-box element. addition,
mutation y-box element alone abrogated tax1-mediated activation. taken
together, data indicate tax1 interacts nf-y b subunit
and interaction results activation major histocompatibility
complex class ii promoter. activation nf-y driven
promoters, tax1-nf-y interaction may play critical role causing cellular
transformation htlv-1 pathogenesis.
