damage-specific recognition incision dna nucleotide excision repair
in yeast mammalian cells requires multiple gene products. amino-acid sequence
homology several yeast mammalian genes suggests mechanism of
nucleotide excision repair conserved eukaryotes, little known
about biochemistry. yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae least 6 genes
are needed process, including rad1 rad10 (ref. 1). mutations 
two genes inactivate nucleotide excision repair result reduced
efficiency mitotic recombinational events repeated sequences. the
rad10 protein stable specific interaction rad1 protein also
binds single-stranded dna promotes annealing homologous single-stranded
dna. amino-acid sequence yeast rad10 protein homologous that
of human excision repair gene ercc1 (ref. 3). demonstrate a
complex purified rad1 rad10 proteins specifically degrades single-stranded
dna endonucleolytic mechanism. endonuclease activity presumably
required remove non-homologous regions single-stranded dna mitotic
recombination repeated sequences previously suggested, may also be
responsible specific incision damaged dna nucleotide excision
