a critical regulatory element many promoters transcribed rna polymerase ii 
is "tata" box, located 25-30 nucleotides upstream the
transcription initiation site. tfiid biochemically defined hela cell nuclear
fraction containing transcription factor activity binds specifically to
the tata box critical determining basal regulated promoter
activity. recently, gene tata-binding protein cloned found to
bind various tata elements substitute tfiid stimulating basal
gene expression vitro transcription systems. however, possible that
additional cellular factors bind tata element influence level 
of gene expression. using lambda gt11 expression cloning oligonucleotides
corresponding human immunodeficiency virus 1 tata element, report the
identification cellular protein calculated molecular mass 123 kda 
that designate tata element modulatory factor (tmf). tmf binds human
immunodeficiency virus 1 tata element gel-retardation assays inhibits
activation viral long terminal repeat tata-binding protein in
vitro transcription assays. tmf contains leucine-zipper amino acid motifs and
exhibits homology dna binding domain phage-encoded dna binding
protein ner. chromosomal mapping localizes tmf gene human chromosome
3p12-p21, site frequent rearrangements lung renal
carcinomas. thus, tmf transcription factor likely regulates the
expression viral cellular genes.
