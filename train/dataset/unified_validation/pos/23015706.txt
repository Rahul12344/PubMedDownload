we begun define human papillomavirus (hpv)-associated proteome 
subset 120 hpv types identified date. our
approach uses mass spectrometry-based platform systematic
identification interactions human papillomavirus host cellular
proteins, report proteomic analysis e6 proteins 16
different hpv types. viruses included represent high-risk, low-risk, and
non-cancer-associated types genus alpha well viruses four
different species genus beta. e6 interaction data set consists 153
cellular proteins, including several previously reported hpv e6 interactors 
as p53, e6ap, maml1, p300/cbp proteins containing pdz domains. report 
the genus-specific binding e6s either e6ap maml1, define specific
hpv e6s bind p300, demonstrate several new features interactions
involving beta hpv e6s. particular, report several beta hpv e6s bind
to proteins containing pdz domains least two beta hpv e6s bind to
p53. finally, report newly discovered interaction proteins e6 of
beta genus, species 2, ccr4-not complex, first report viral
protein binding complex. data set represents comprehensive survey 
of e6 binding partners provides resource hpv field allow 
continued studies diverse biology human papillomaviruses.
