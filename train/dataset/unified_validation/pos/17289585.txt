although proteasome facilitates transcription several yeast promoters,
it unclear role proteolytic subunits involved. show 
that proteasome regulates hiv-1 promoter proteolytic and
nonproteolytic modes. absence transcription factor, tat, proteasome was
associated promoter coding regions, proteolytic activity
regulated level basal transcription emanating promoter. tat
switched proteasome nonproteolytic mode recruiting a
proteasome-associated protein, paaf1, favors proteasome dissociation into
19s 20s particles. gel filtration chromatography showed expression of
both tat paaf1 enhanced abundance 19s-like complex nuclear
extracts. 19s, 20s, subunits strongly recruited promoter in
the presence tat paaf1 coactivated tat-dependent transcription. 19s
components facilitated transcriptional elongation may involved in
clearance paused transcriptional elongation complexes promoter.
