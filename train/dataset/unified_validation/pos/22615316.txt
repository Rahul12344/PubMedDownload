we previously reported hepatitis b virus (hbv) e antigen (hbeag) inhibits
production interleukin 6 suppressing nf-κb activation. nf-κb known be
activated receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (ripk2),
and examined mechanisms interleukin 6 regulation hbeag. hbeag
inhibits ripk2 expression interacts ripk2, may represent 2
mechanisms hbeag blocks nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain-containing protein 1 ligand-induced nf-κb activation hepg2 cells. our
findings identified novel molecular mechanisms whereby hbeag modulates
intracellular signaling pathways targeting ripk2, supporting concept 
hbeag could impair innate adaptive immune responses promote chronic
hbv infection.
