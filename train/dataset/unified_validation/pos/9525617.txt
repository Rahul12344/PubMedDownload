host proteins incorporated retroviral virions assembly and
budding. examined three retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1), simian immunodeficiency virus (siv), moloney murine leukemia virus
(mo-mulv), presence ubiquitin inside virions. a
protease treatment remove exterior viral well contaminating cellular
proteins, proteins remaining inside virion analyzed. results
presented show three virions incorporate ubiquitin molecules at
approximately 10% level gag found virions. addition free
ubiquitin, covalent ubiquitin-gag complexes detected, isolated, and
characterized three viruses. immunoblot protein sequencing
results treated virions showed approximately 2% either hiv-1 siv
p6gag covalently attached single ubiquitin molecule inside the
respective virions approximately 2 5% p12gag mo-mulv
virions monoubiquitinated. results show ubiquitination gag is
conserved among retroviruses occurs p6gag portion gag
polyprotein, region likely involved assembly budding.
