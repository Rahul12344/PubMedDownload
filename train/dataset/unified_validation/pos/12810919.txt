translation hepatitis c genome mediated internal ribosome entry on
the structurally complex 5' untranslated region large viral rna.
initiation protein synthesis mechanism independent the
cap-binding factor eif4e, activity initiator met-trna(f)-binding
factor eif2 still required. hcv protein synthesis thus potentially
sensitive inhibition eif2 activity result the
phosphorylation latter interferon-inducible, double-stranded
rna-activated protein kinase pkr. two virally encoded proteins, ns5a e2, have
been shown reduce inhibitory effect pkr impairing activation of
the kinase. present evidence third viral strategy pkr
inhibition. region viral rna comprising part internal ribosome
entry site (ires) able bind pkr competition double-stranded rna

hcv ires pkr-activating ability. consistent findings,
cotransfection experiments employing bicistronic reporter construct and
wild-type pkr indicate expression protein kinase less inhibitory
towards hcv ires-driven protein synthesis towards cap-dependent protein
synthesis. data suggest dual function viral ires, a
structural role promoting initiation complex formation regulatory role
in preventing inhibition initiation pkr.
