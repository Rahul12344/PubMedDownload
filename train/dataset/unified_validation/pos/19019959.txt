decisive step virus entry. showed previously er-resident factor
erp29 induces local unfolding pyv initiate er membrane penetration 
process. erp29 contains n-terminal thioredoxin domain (ntd) mediates 
dimerization novel c-terminal all-helical domain (ctd) whose function is
unclear. ntd-mediated dimerization erp29 critical unfolding
activity; whether ctd plays role pyv unfolding unknown. show
that three hydrophobic residues within last helix erp29 ctd 
individually mutated either lysine alanine abolished erp29's ability to
stimulate pyv unfolding infection. effect due global
misfolding mutant proteins, dimerize form aggregates or
display increased protease sensitivity. moreover, mutant proteins stimulated 
secretion secretory protein thyroglobulin efficiency similar to
that wild-type erp29. using cross-linking coimmunoprecipitation assay, we
found physical interaction erp29 ctd mutants pyv is
inefficient. data thus demonstrate erp29 ctd plays crucial role in
pyv unfolding infection, likely serving part substrate-binding
domain.
