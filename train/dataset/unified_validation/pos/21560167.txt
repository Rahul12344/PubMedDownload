the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) genome encodes 18 proteins 2 
peptides. four proteins encode high-affinity calmodulin-binding sites
for direct interactions calmodulin already described. in
this study, hiv-1 proteome queried using algorithm predicts
calmodulin-binding sites revealing seven new putative calmodulin-binding sites
including residues 34-56 transactivator transcription (tat). tat a
101-residue intrinsically disordered rna-binding protein plays central
role regulation hiv-1 replication. interactions tat peptide
(residues 34-56), melittin, well-characterized calmodulin-binding peptide, 
calmodulin examined direct binding studies, mass spectrometry, and
fluorescence. tat peptide binds calcium-saturated apo-calmodulin 
with low micromolar affinity. conformational changes induced tat peptide
were determined circular dichroism, residues calmodulin interact
with peptide identified hsqc nmr spectroscopy. multiple interactions 
between hiv-1 proteins calmodulin, highly promiscuous signal transduction
hub protein, may important mechanism virus controls cell
physiology.
