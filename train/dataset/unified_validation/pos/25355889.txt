simian hemorrhagic fever virus (shfv) causes severe almost uniformly fatal 
viral hemorrhagic fever asian macaques thought nonpathogenic 
humans. date, shfv life cycle almost completely uncharacterized 
molecular level. here, describe first steps shfv life cycle. our
experiments indicate shfv enters target cells low-ph-dependent
endocytosis. dynamin inhibitors, chlorpromazine, methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
chloroquine, concanamycin dramatically reduced shfv entry efficiency,
whereas macropinocytosis inhibitors eipa, blebbistatin, wortmannin and
the caveolin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors nystatin filipin iii no
effect. furthermore, overexpression knockout study electron microscopy
results indicate shfv entry occurs dynamin-dependent clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis-like pathway. experiments utilizing latrunculin b, cytochalasin b,
and cytochalasin indicate shfv hijack actin polymerization
pathway. treatment target cells proteases (proteinase k, papain,
α-chymotrypsin, trypsin) abrogated entry, indicating shfv cell
surface receptor protein. phospholipases a2 effect shfv
entry. finally, treatment cells antibodies targeting cd163, cell
surface molecule identified entry factor shfv-related porcine
reproductive respiratory syndrome virus, diminished shfv replication,
identifying cd163 important shfv entry component.importance: simian
hemorrhagic fever virus (shfv) causes highly lethal disease asian macaques
resembling human illness caused ebola lassa virus. however, little known
about shfv's ecology molecular biology mechanism causes
disease. results study shed light shfv enters target
cells. using electron microscopy inhibitors various cellular pathways, we
demonstrate shfv invades cells low-ph-dependent, actin-independent
endocytosis, likely help cellular surface protein.
