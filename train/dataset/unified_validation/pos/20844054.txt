viruses obligate intracellular parasites depend cellular machinery
for efficient transcription replication. previous study we
reported bovine foamy virus (bfv) able activate nuclear factor κb 
(nf-κb) pathway action transactivator btas enhance viral
transcription. however, mechanism used nf-κb enhance bfv transcription 
remains elusive. address question, employed yeast two-hybrid assay
to screen btas-interacting proteins. found relb, member nf-κb
protein family, interacts btas. confirmed putative relb-btas
interaction vitro vivo identified protein regions responsible
for relb-btas interaction. using luciferase reporter assay, next showed 
that relb enhances bfv transcription (btas-induced long terminal repeat [ltr]
transactivation) process requires localization the
relb-btas interaction nucleus rel homology domain relb. the
knockdown cellular endogenous relb protein using small interfering rna
(sirna) significantly attenuated btas-induced ltr transcription. results of
chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) analysis showed endogenous relb binds
to viral ltr bfv-infected cells. together, results suggest bfv 
engages relb protein cotransactivator btas enhance viral
transcription. addition, findings indicate bfv infection upregulates 
cellular relb expression btas-induced nf-κb activation. thus, study 
demonstrates existence positive-feedback circuit bfv utilizes
the host's nf-κb pathway relb protein efficient viral
transcription.
