viral infection initiates series signaling cascades lead the
transcription interferons (ifns), finally inducing interferon-stimulated genes
(isgs) eliminate viruses. viruses evolved variety strategies to
modulate host ifn-mediated immune responses. herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) us3, 
a ser/thr kinase conserved alphaherpesviruses, previously reported to
counteract host innate immunity; however, molecular mechanism elusive. 
this study, report us3 blocks ifn-β production hyperphosphorylating
ifn regulatory factor 3 (irf3). ectopic expression us3 protein significantly
inhibited sendai virus (sev)-mediated activation ifn-β ifn-stimulated
response element (isre) promoters transcription ifn-β, isg54, and
isg56. us3 also shown block sev-induced dimerization nuclear
translocation irf3. kinase activity indispensable inhibitory
function, kinase-dead (kd) us3 mutants k220m d305a could inhibit ifn-β
production. furthermore, us3 interacted hyperphosphorylated irf3 at
ser175 prevent irf3 activation. finally, us3 kd mutant viruses were
constructed denoted k220m d305a hsv-1, respectively. cells mice
infected mutant viruses produced remarkably larger amounts ifn-β
than infected wild-type hsv-1. first time, findings
provide convincing evidence us3 hyperphosphorylates irf3, blocks the
production ifn-β, subverts host innate immunity.
