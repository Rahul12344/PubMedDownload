human mcp-1-induced protein 1 (mcpip1, also known zc3h12a regnase-1) plays
important roles negatively regulating cellular inflammatory response.
recently, found rnase, mcpip1 broad-spectrum antiviral effects 
by targeting viral rna. study, demonstrated mcpip1 expression was
induced hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection huh7.5 hepatoma cells. mcpip1
expression higher liver tissue patients chronic hcv infection
compared without chronic hcv infection. knockdown mcpip1 increased 
hcv replication hcv-mediated expression proinflammatory cytokines, as
tnf-α, il-6, mcp-1. however, overexpression mcpip1 significantly inhibited
hcv replication hcv-mediated expression proinflammatory cytokines. various
mutants functional domains mcpip1 showed disruption rna binding 
oligomerization abilities, well rnase activity, deubiquitinase
activity, impaired inhibitory activity hcv replication. on
immunocytochemistry, mcpip1 colocalized hcv rna. use a
replication-defective hcv john cunningham 1/aag mutant vitro rna cleavage 
assay demonstrated mcpip1 could directly degrade hcv rna. mcpip1 may
suppress hcv replication hcv-mediated proinflammatory responses with
infection, might contribute regulation host defense the
infection virus-induced inflammation.
