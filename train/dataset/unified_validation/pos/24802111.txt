influenza virus (iav), similar viruses, exploits machinery of
human host cells survival replication. identified α-actinin-4, a
host cytoskeletal protein, interacting partner iav nucleoprotein (np).
we confirmed interaction using co-immunoprecipitation studies, first a
coupled vitro transcription-translation assay cells either
transiently co-expressing two proteins infected whole iav.
importantly, np-actinin-4 interaction observed several iav subtypes,
including 2009 h1n1 pandemic virus. moreover, immunofluorescence studies
revealed np actinin-4 co-localized largely around nucleus and
also cytoplasmic region virus-infected a549 cells. silencing of
actinin-4 expression resulted significant decrease np, m2 and
ns1 viral protein expression, also reduction np mrna viral rna 
levels, well viral titers, 24 h post-infection iav, suggesting that
actinin-4 critical viral replication. furthermore, actinin-4 depletion
reduced amount np localized nucleus. treatment infected cells
with wortmannin, known inhibitor actinin-4, led decrease np mrna
levels also caused nuclear retention np, strengthening our
previous observations. taken together, results present study indicate 
that actinin-4, novel interacting partner iav np, plays crucial role in
viral replication interaction may participate nuclear localization of
np and/or viral ribonucleoproteins.
