tanapox virus (tpv) encodes expresses secreted tnf-binding protein, tpv-2l 
or gp38, displays inhibitory properties tnf diverse mammalian
species, including human, monkey, canine rabbit. tpv-2l also sequence
similarity mhc-class heavy chain interacts differently human 
tnf compared known cellular tnf receptors known
virus-encoded tnf receptor homologs derived many poxviruses. order to
determine tnf binding region tpv-2l, various tpv-2l c-terminal truncations
and internal deletions created muteins expressed using
recombinant baculovirus vectors. c-terminal deletions tpv-2l resulted in
reduced binding affinity human tnf specific mutants tnf that
discriminate tnf-r1 tnf-r2. however, deletion c-terminal 42 amino 
acid residues totally abolished binding human tnf mutants. removal
of predicted internal domains resulted mutant tpv-2l protein
incapable binding human tnf. deletion c-terminal residues also affected 
the ability tpv-2l block tnf-induced cellular cytotoxicity. addition 
tnf, tpv-2l also form complexes human beta2-microglobulin form a
novel macromolecular complex. summary, tpv-2l protein bona fide mhc-1
heavy chain family member binds inhibits human tnf fashion very
distinct known poxvirus-encoded tnf inhibitors, also form a
novel complex human mhc-1 light chain, beta2-microglobulin.
