expression e6 e7 oncogenes high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpv)
is controlled cellular transcription factors viral e2 e8--e2c
proteins, derived hpv e2 gene. proteins bind 
repress hpv e6/e7 promoter. promoter inhibition suggested due 
to binding site competition cellular transcription factors to
interactions different cellular transcription modulators different
amino termini e2 e8--e2c. identified cellular chromodomain
helicase dna binding domain 6 protein (chd6) novel interactor hpv31
e8--e2c using yeast two-hybrid screening. pull-down coimmunoprecipitation 
assays indicate chd6 interacts hpv31 e8--e2c protein via e2c
domain. interaction conserved, occurs also e8--e2c
proteins expressed hpv16 -18 hpv31 e2 protein. rna
knockdown experiments mutational analyses e2c domain suggest that
binding chd6 e8--e2c contributes transcriptional repression the
hpv e6/e7 oncogene promoter. provide evidence chd6 also involved in
transcriptional repression activation e2. taken together results
indicate e2c domain mediates specific dna binding also 
an additional role transcriptional repression recruitment chd6
protein. suggests repression e6/e7 promoter e2 e8--e2c
involves multiple interactions host cell proteins different protein 
domains.
