vaccinia virus intracellular mature virus (imv) binds glycosaminoglycans
(gags) cells via three virion proteins, h3l, a27l, d8l. study, 
demonstrated binding imv bsc40 cells competitively inhibited by
soluble laminin fibronectin collagen v, suggesting cell
surface extracellular matrix (ecm) protein may play role vaccinia virus
entry. moreover, imv infection gag(-) sog9 cells also inhibited by
laminin, demonstrating virion binding laminin involve prior
interaction gags. furthermore, comparative envelope protein analyses of
wild-type vaccinia virus strain western reserve, binds laminin, a
mutant virus, ia27l, not, showed a26l open reading frame
(orf), encoding envelope protein, mutated ia27l, resulting a26l
being absent imv. expression wild-type a26l orf ia27l resulted
in laminin binding activity. moreover, recombinant a26l protein bound laminin 
in vitro high affinity, providing direct evidence a26l laminin
binding protein imv. summary, results reveal novel role the
vaccinia viral envelope protein a26l binding ecm protein laminin, an
association proposed facilitate imv entry.
