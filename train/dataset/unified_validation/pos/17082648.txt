chemokines receptors play key role immune homeostasis regulating
leukocyte migration, differentiation, function. viruses acquired and
optimized molecules interact chemokine system. virus-encoded 
molecules promote cell entry, facilitate dissemination infected cells, and
enable virus evade immune response. one molecule murine
gammaherpesvirus 68 genome m3 gene, encodes secreted 44-kda
protein binds high affinity certain murine human chemokines 
blocks chemokine signaling vitro. test hypothesis m3 directly
interferes diverse chemokines vivo, examined interaction m3
with ccl2 cxcl13 expressed pancreas transgenic mice. ccl2
expression pancreas promoted recruitment monocytes dendritic cells;
cxcl13 promoted recruitment b lymphocytes. coexpression m3 the
pancreas blocked cellular recruitment induced ccl2 cxcl13. these
results define m3 multichemokine blocker demonstrate use powerful
tool analyze chemokine biology.
