immunity optimal priming adaptive immunity west nile virus (wnv), 
an emerging vector-borne virus, depend recognition rig-i mda5, two
cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (prrs) rig-i-like receptor (rlr)
protein family recognize viral rna activate defense programs that
suppress infection. evaluated individual functions rig-i mda5

incoming virion rna display least two distinct pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (pamps) containing 5' triphosphate double-stranded rna are
temporally distributed sensed rig-i mda5 infection. thus, rig-i

wnv replication. collectively, experiments highlight necessity and
function multiple related, cytoplasmic host sensors orchestrating an
effective immune response acute viral infection.
