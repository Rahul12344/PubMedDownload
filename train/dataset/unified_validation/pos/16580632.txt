severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) 7a accessory
protein known homologues. study, report interaction a
sars-cov 7a small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein 
(sgt). sars-cov 7a human sgt interaction identified using two-hybrid
system screen confirmed interaction screens cell culture cellular
co-localization studies. sgt domain interaction mapped deletion
mutant analysis results indicated tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (aa
125-158) essential interaction. also showed 7a interacted with
sars-cov structural proteins (membrane) e (envelope), shown
to essential virus-like particle formation. taken together, results
coupled data studies interaction sgt hiv-1 vpu
indicated sgt could involved life-cycle, possibly assembly of
sars-cov.
