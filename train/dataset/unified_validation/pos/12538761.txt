cellular well viral rnas usually found complexed proteins. an
attempt identify proteins interact transcripts hepatitis b virus 
(hbv), dna virus replicates reverse transcription, partial cdna 
was isolated human cdna expression library whose gene product bound 
hbv-derived rna. using overlapping clone molecular hybridization screen
a full-length cdna assembled. contained large open reading frame a
1208 amino-acid protein 138 kda identical hypothetical product the
kiaa0675 clone. closely related sequences present mouse cdna libraries but
not genomes lower organisms. protein sequence contained known
rna-binding domain and, apart probable coiled-coil domain, only
significant homology involved complete ring-h2 motif. suggested the
protein might novel rna-binding ring-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligase or
e3 enzyme. motif critical rna binding experimentally mapped a
central lys-rich region. binding specificity either broad protein has
as yet unknown physiological targets; hence, present, potential importance
for hbv biology remains open. ring-h2 domain functional essential 
for self- trans-ubiquitylation vitro proteasome-mediated turnover 
of protein vivo. therefore termed hrul138 human rna-binding
ubiquitin ligase 138 kda. hrul138 mrnas expressed low levels most
tissues. gfp-tagged hrul138 derivatives found associated cytoplasmic
structures, possibly er, excluded nucleus. combined presence
of rna binding e3 activity hrul138 raises possibility are
mechanistically linked.
