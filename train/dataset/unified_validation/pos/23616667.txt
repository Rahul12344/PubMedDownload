human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) etiologic agent adult
t-cell leukemia (atl). viral regulatory protein tax1 plays pivotal role 
t-cell transformation atl development. previous studies laboratory,
using yeast 2-hybrid approach screen t-cell library tax1-interacting
partners, identified cellular four half lim domain protein 3 (fhl3) 
a possible tax1-interacting candidate. fhl3 member fhl family of
proteins, function transcriptional coactivators cytoskeleton
regulators role cancer progression development. aim this
study investigate physical functional interaction tax1 and
members fhl family proteins. show tax1 fhl3 interact both
in vitro vivo. furthermore, fhl1 -2 also interact tax1. we
have demonstrated fhl3 enhances tax1-mediated activation viral long
terminal repeat (ltr) without affecting basal activity fhl1 -3
regulate nf-κb activation tax1 cell-specific manner. addition, have
found interaction tax1 fhl1 -3 affects localization
of proteins, leading redistribution cells. tax1 also affected
fhl3 cytoskeleton function increasing fhl3-mediated cell spreading. overall,
our results suggest interaction tax1 fhl family alters
both transactivating activity subcellular localization tax1 and
provide new insights molecular mechanisms underlie oncogenic nature
of htlv-1 protein.
