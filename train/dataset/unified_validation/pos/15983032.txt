previously, reported brca1 strongly represses transcriptional
activity estrogen receptor-alpha (er-alpha) human breast prostate
cancer cells weakly inhibits er-alpha cervical cancer cells. now
report introduction human papillomavirus e7 e6 oncogenes into
human papillomavirus-negative cells rescues brca1 repression er-alpha
activity e7 e6 oncoproteins interact directly brca1 in
vitro associate brca1 vivo cultured cells. interaction
involves least two contact points brca1, one within n-terminal site
shown previously interact er-alpha c-terminal region
of brca1 containing first brca1 c-terminal domain. point mutations within the
zinc finger domains e7 e6 inactivated binding n terminus of
brca1 reduced ability rescue brca1 inhibition er-alpha. e6 e7
also antagonized ability brca1 inhibit c-myc e-box-mediated
transactivation human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter activity, 
a manner dependent upon zinc finger domains. finally, ability e6 and
e7 antagonize brca1 involve proteolytic degradation brca1. these
findings suggest functional interactions brca1 e7 e6. potential
significance findings discussed.
