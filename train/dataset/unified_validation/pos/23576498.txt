foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv), causative agent foot-and-mouth
disease, aphthovirus within picornaviridae family. infection
with fmdv, several host cell membrane rearrangements occur form sites viral
replication. fmdv protein 2c part replication complex thought to
have multiple roles virus replication. better understand role 2c
in process virus replication, using yeast two-hybrid
approach identify host proteins interact 2c. recently reported
that cellular beclin1 natural ligand 2c involved the
autophagy pathway, shown important fmdv replication. here, we
report cellular vimentin also specific host binding partner 2c. the
2c-vimentin interaction confirmed coimmunoprecipitation and
immunofluorescence staining occur fmdv-infected cells. shown that
upon infection vimentin structure forms around 2c structure is
later resolved disappears. interestingly, overexpression vimentin no
effect virus replication; however, overexpression truncated
dominant-negative form vimentin resulted significant decrease viral
yield. acrylamide, causes disruption vimentin filaments, also inhibited 
viral yield. alanine scanning mutagenesis used map specific amino acid
residues 2c critical vimentin binding. using reverse genetics, we
identified 2c residues necessary virus growth, suggesting the
interaction fmdv 2c cellular vimentin essential virus
replication.
