in contrast rna viruses, influenza viruses replicate genome 
nucleus infected cells. result, newly-synthesized vrna genomes, the
form viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vrnps), must exported the
cytoplasm productive infection. characterize composition vrnp
export complexes interplay nucleus infected cells, we
affinity-purified tagged vrnps biochemically fractionated infected nuclei.
after treatment infected cells leptomycin b, potent inhibitor of
crm1-mediated export, isolated vrnp export complexes which, unexpectedly, were
tethered host-cell chromatin high affinity. late time points 
of infection, cellular export receptor crm1 also accumulated same
regions chromatin vrnps, led decrease export other
nuclear crm1 substrates nucleus. interestingly, chromatin targeting of
vrnp export complexes brought association rcc1, ran guanine
exchange factor responsible generating rangtp driving crm1-dependent
nuclear export. thus, influenza viruses gain preferential access to
newly-generated host cell export machinery targeting vrnp export complexes
