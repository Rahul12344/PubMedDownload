for outcome hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, viral l envelope
protein pre-s domain performs pivotal functions mediating attachment 
of hbv liver cells, envelopment viral capsids, release (sub)viral
particles, regulation supercoiled dna amplification, transcriptional
transactivation. assess multiple functions host-protein assistance
involved, initiated two-hybrid screen using l-specific pre-s1 domain 
bait. approach, identified gamma2-adaptin, putative member of
the clathrin adaptor proteins responsible protein sorting trafficking, as
a specific binding partner l protein. evidence physical interaction
between l protein gamma2-adaptin also demonstrated affinity
chromatography coimmunoprecipitation, binding sites mapped to
the l-specific pre-s1 domain gamma2-adaptin-specific ear domain. the
specificity interaction sustained failure of
gamma1-adaptin, closely related gamma2-adaptin homologue, associate l
protein. analysis l mutant protein indicates l-gamma2-adaptin
interaction strictly depends pre-s1 domain transmembrane l protein
oriented cytosol thus appears occur cytosolic environment.
interestingly, coexpression two interacting partners transfected cells 
resulted recruitment gamma2-adaptin l protein onto cis-golgi-like
structures, strongly indicating association physiologically relevant.
together, results suggest role gamma2-adaptin l-mediated processes
of viral biogenesis and/or pathogenesis, facilitating guiding hbv
assembly.
