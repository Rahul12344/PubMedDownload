the adenovirus type 12 (ad12) e1a12s oncoprotein utilizes camp/protein kinase
a (pka) signal transduction pathway activate expression viral e2 gene, 
the products essential viral replication. central unsolved
question is, however, whether e1a12s interacts directly pka process
of promoter activation. show e1a12s binds regulatory subunits
(r) pka vitro vivo. interaction depends n-terminus the
conserved region 1 (cr1) e1a12s. domains also essential the
activation viral e2 gene expression. infection cells ad12 leads the
cellular redistribution riialpha cytoplasm nucleus.
furthermore, riialpha also located nucleus cells transformed e1
of ad12 transient expression e1a12s leads redistribution of
riialpha nucleus n-terminus- cr1-dependent manner.
cotransfection e1a12s riialpha results strong activation e2
promoter. based results conclude e1a12s functions viral
a-kinase anchoring protein redistributing riialpha cytoplasm the
nucleus involved e1a12s-mediated activation e2 promoter.
