the envelope glycoprotein (env) human immunodeficiency virus type-1
(hiv-1) critical determinant viral infectivity, tropism main
target humoral immunity; however, little known cellular
machinery directs env trafficking incorporation nascent
virions. identify mammalian retromer complex novel important
cellular factor regulating env trafficking. retromer mediates endosomal sorting
and closely associated endosome-to-golgi transport. consistent 
this function, inactivating retromer using rnai targeting cargo selective
trimer complex inhibited retrograde trafficking endocytosed env golgi. 
notably, hiv-1 infected cells, inactivating retromer modulated plasma membrane
expression env, along env incorporation virions particle
infectivity. mutagenesis studies coupled coimmunoprecipitations revealed
that retromer-mediated trafficking requires env cytoplasmic tail show
binds directly retromer components vps35 vps26. taken together these
results provide novel insight regulation hiv-1 env trafficking and
infectious hiv-1 morphogenesis show first time role retromer in
the late-steps viral replication assembly virus.
