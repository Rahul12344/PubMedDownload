background: genetic basis avian mammalian host switching influenza 
a virus largely unknown. human a/hk/156/1997 (h5n1) virus transmitted
from poultry possesses ns1 gene mutations f103l + m106i virulence
determinants mouse model pneumonia; however individual roles have
not determined. emergent a/shanghai/patient1/2013(h7n9)-like viruses
also possess mutations may contribute virulence ability 
to switch species.
methods: ns1 mutant viruses constructed reverse genetics site
directed mutagenesis human mouse-adapted backbones. mouse infections
assessed virulence, virus yield, tissue infection, ifn induction. ns1 protein
properties assessed subcellular distribution, ifn antagonism (mouse 
human), cpsf30 rig-i domain binding, host transcription (microarray); the
natural prevalence 103l 106i mutants assessed.
results: f103l m106i mutations contributes additively to
virulence reduce lethal dose >800 >3,200 fold respectively by
mediating alveolar tissue infection >100 fold increased infectious yields.
the 106i ns1 mutant lost cpsf binding 103l mutant maintained binding that
correlated increased general decrease host gene expression human
but mouse cells. mutation positively modulated inhibition ifn
induction mouse cells activation ifn-Î² promoter human cells 
not combination human cells indicating negative epistasis. the
f103l m106i mutations restored defect cytoplasmic localization h5n1
ns1 mouse cells. human h1n1 h3n2 ns1 proteins bound card, helicase 
and rd rig-i domains, whereas h5n1 ns1 consensus 103f 106m 
mutations bind domains, totally partially restored 
the m106i f103l mutations respectively.
conclusions: f103l m106i mutations h5n1 ns1 protein increased
ifn antagonism mediated interstitial pneumonia mice associated
with increased cytoplasmic localization altered host factor binding. these
mutations may contribute ability previous hpai h5n1 recent lpai
h7n9 h6n1 (ns1-103l+106m) viruses switch hosts cause disease in
humans.
