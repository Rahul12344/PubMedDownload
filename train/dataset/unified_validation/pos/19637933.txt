vaccinia virus, large double-stranded dna virus, prototype the
orthopoxvirus genus, includes several pathogenic poxviruses humans, such
as monkeypox virus variola virus. here, report comprehensive yeast
two-hybrid (y2h) screening protein-protein interactions vaccinia 
and human proteins. total 109 novel vaccinia-human protein interactions were
detected among 33 viral proteins. validate subsets interactions, we
constructed orfeome library vaccinia virus strain wr using gateway
plasmid cloning system. co-expressing selected vaccinia host proteins a
variety expression systems, found least 17 y2h hits
identified vaccinia human proteins verified independent
methods using gst pull-down assays, representing 63% validation rate the
y2h hits examined (17/27). cloned orfs conveniently transferable 
from entry vectors various destination expression vectors, vaccinia
orfeome library useful resource future high-throughput functional
proteomic experiments.
