elsewhere laboratory reported (i) icp0 interacts cyclin d3 not
d1 d2. 3 cyclins independently partially rescue deltaicp0 mutants. (ii)
interaction cyclin d3 required switch nuclear cytoplasmic
accumulation icp0. (iii) infected cells cdk4 activated whereas cdk2 is
not. inhibition cdk4 results nuclear retention icp0. overexpression of
cyclin d3 reverses effect inhibitor. report following. (i)
cdk4 interacts icp0, icp4, possibly icp8. interaction is
required recruit cdk4 initially nd10 later viral replication
compartments. (ii) cdk4 inhibitor reduced delayed transcription and
ultimately translation mrnas icp4, icp27, icp8 lesser extent
that icp0 gene wild-type virus-infected cells. (iii) overexpression 
cyclin d3 resulted rapid transcription genes. presence 
of inhibitor, rates accumulation products genes resemble
those wild-type virus absence inhibitor. (iv) overexpression of
cyclin d3 also results mobilization cdk6 nuclei infected cells. we
conclude icp0 encodes function enhances recruitment cyclin d3 
to nd10 structures activate cdk4 icp0 along viral proteins
recruits cdk4 nd10 structures ultimately replication compartments for
enhanced expression viral genes viral dna synthesis.
