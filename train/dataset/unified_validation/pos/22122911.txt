background: hiv surface glycoprotein gp120 (su, gp120) plasmodium
vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp) bind chemokine receptors infection 
and site amino acid sequence similarity binding domains that
often includes heparin binding motif (hbm). infection either pathogen has
been found inhibited polyanions.
results: specific polyanions inhibit hiv infection bind v3 loop
of x4 strains also inhibited dbp-mediated infection erythrocytes dbp
binding duffy antigen receptor chemokines (darc). peptide including 
the hbm pvdbp similar affinity heparin rantes v3 loop peptides,
and could specifically inhibited heparin binding polyanions
that inhibit dbp binding darc. however, v3 peptides competitively
inhibit rantes binding heparin, pvdbp hbm peptide. three other
members dbp family hbm sequence necessary erythrocyte 
binding, however protein binds darc, p. knowlesi alpha
protein, inhibited heparin binding erythrocytes. heparitinase
digestion affect binding dbp erythrocytes.
conclusion: hbms dbps bind darc similar heparin binding
affinities v3 loop peptides chemokines, responsible specific 
sulfated polysaccharide inhibition parasite binding invasion red blood 
cells, likely bind negative charges receptor cell 
surface glycosaminoglycans.
