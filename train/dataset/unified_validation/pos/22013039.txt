tankyrase 1 poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) localizes multiple
subcellular sites, including telomeres mitotic centrosomes.
poly(adp-ribosyl)ation nuclear mitotic apparatus (numa) protein by
tankyrase 1 mitosis essential sister telomere resolution and
mitotic spindle pole formation. interphase cells, tankyrase 1 resides the
cytoplasm, role therein well understood. study, found
that herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection induced extensive modification of
tankyrase 1 tankyrase 2. modification dependent extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (erk) activity triggered hsv infection. following
hsv-1 infection, tankyrase 1 recruited nucleus. early phase 
infection, tankyrase 1 colocalized icp0 thereafter localized within 
hsv replication compartment, blocked cells infected hsv-1
icp0-null mutant r7910. absence infection, icp0 interacted with
tankyrase 1 efficiently promoted nuclear localization. hsv not
replicate efficiently cells depleted tankyrases 1 2. moreover,
xav939, inhibitor tankyrase parp activity, decreased viral titers 2 to
5% control values. concluded hsv targets tankyrase 1 icp0- and
erk-dependent manner facilitate replication.
