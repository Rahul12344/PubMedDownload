although spleen tyrosine kinase (syk) known important hematopoietic
cell development, roles syk epithelial cells well
studied. limited data suggest syk plays alternate roles carcinogenesis
under different circumstances. breast cancer, syk suggested a
tumor suppressor. contrast, syk essential murine mammary tumor
virus-mediated transformation. however, roles syk tumor migration are
still largely unknown. nasopharyngeal carcinoma, unusually highly metastatic
tumor, expresses epstein-barr virus lmp2a (latent membrane protein 2a) most
clinical specimens. previously, demonstrated lmp2a triggers epithelial cell
migration. lmp2a contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif,
which important syk kinase activation b cells. study, we
explored whether syk important lmp2a-mediated epithelial cell migration.
we demonstrate lmp2a expression activate endogenous syk activity. the
activation requires tyrosine residues lmp2a itam yeea motif, which
is important syk activation lyn b cells. lmp2a interacts syk as
demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation confocal microscopy. furthermore,
lmp2a-induced cell migration inhibited syk inhibitor short
interfering rna. tyrosines 74 85 lmp2a immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motif essential syk activation lmp2a-mediated cell
migration, indicating involvement syk lmp2a-triggered cell migration.
the lmp2a-syk pathway may provide suitable drug targets treatment of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
