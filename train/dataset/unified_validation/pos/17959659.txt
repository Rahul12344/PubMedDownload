the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vpu accessory protein a
transmembrane protein regulates cd4 expression promotes release
of new virions. screened human leukocyte-specific yeast two-hybrid
expression library discover novel vpu-interacting cellular proteins. major
histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc ii) invariant chain, also called ii or
cd74, found one protein. show direct binding vpu cd74 by
using yeast two-hybrid assay coimmunoprecipitation hiv-1-infected
cells. cytoplasmic region vpu found interact 30-amino-acid
cytoplasmic tail cd74. human monocytic u937 cells infected wild-type or
vpu-defective hiv-1 transfected cells showed vpu modulated the
surface expression mature mhc ii molecules. reduction cell surface
mature mhc ii molecules correlated decreased antigen presentation cells
in culture. thus, vpu protein also contributes viral persistence by
attenuating immune responses hiv infection. report further
exemplifies rich diversity redundancy shown hiv immune evasion.
