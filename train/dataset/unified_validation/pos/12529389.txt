cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cdkis) shown block human
immunodeficiency virus herpes simplex virus. hypothesized cdkis
block viral replication inhibiting transcription specific cellular genes.
here find three cdkis, flavopiridol, purvalanol a, and
methoxy-roscovitine, block moloney murine leukemia virus (mlv) transcription
events. using gene expression microarray technology examine inhibitory
effects cdkis, observed cellular gene, pre-b-cell leukemia
transcription factor 1 (pbx1) gene, down-regulated cdki treatment. pbx
consensus element (pce), tgattgac, conserved long terminal repeats of
several murine retroviruses, including moloney mlv. mutations pce
completely inhibited viral transcription whereas overexpression pbx1 a
pbx1-associated protein, prep1, enhanced viral transcription. interaction
between pce pbx1-prep1 proteins confirmed gel shift experiments.
blocking pbx1 protein synthesis resulted significant decrease viral
transcription. collectively, results represent first work demonstrating
that homeodomain proteins pbx1 prep1 cellular factors involved in
moloney mlv transcription regulation.
