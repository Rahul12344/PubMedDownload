epstein-barr virus (ebv), like dna tumor viruses, induces s-phase the
natural host cell, human b lymphocyte. linked blast
transformation. believed ebv-encoded nuclear antigen 6 (ebna-6) is
involved regulation cell cycle entry. however, possible mechanism
of regulation approached. current study, found ebna-6 
binds mrps18-2 protein, targets nucleus. found that
mrps18-2 binds hypo- hyperphosphorylated forms rb protein
specifically. binding targets small pocket prb, site of
interaction e2f1. mrps18-2 competes binding e2f1 prb,
thereby raising level free e2f1. experimental data suggest ebna-6
may play major role entry ebv infected b cells phase by
binding raising level nuclear mrps18-2, protein. would inhibit
prb binding e2f1 competitively lift block preventing s-phase entry.
