previously reported nuclear export unspliced spliced murine
leukemia virus (mlv) transcripts depends nuclear export factor (nxf1)
pathway. although mrna export complex trex, contains aly/ref, uap56,
and tho complex, involved nxf1-mediated nuclear export cellular 
mrnas, contribution export mlv mrna transcripts remains poorly
understood. here, studied involvement trex components export 
mlv transcripts. depletion uap56, aly/ref, reduced level both
unspliced spliced viral transcripts cytoplasm. interestingly,
depletion tho components, including thoc5 thoc7, affected unspliced
viral transcripts cytoplasm. moreover, rna immunoprecipitation assay
showed unspliced viral transcript interacted thoc5. these
results imply mlv requires uap56, thoc5 thoc7, addition nxf1, 
nuclear export viral transcripts. given naturally intronless mrnas, but
not bulk mrnas, require thoc5 nuclear export, plausible thoc5
plays key role export unspliced mlv transcripts.
