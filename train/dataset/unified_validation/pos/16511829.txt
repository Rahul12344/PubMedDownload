transcription hiv-1 genome complex event requires functional and
physical communication cellular proteins recognize ltr sequence 
viral proteins, notably, tat. moreover, studies revealed ability of
tat induce transcription variety cellular genes whose products can
affect status cells, thus contributing pathogenesis aids.
recently, demonstrated expression tat astrocytes neural
cells leads upregulation rad51, major component dna repair via
homologous recombination. unscheduled upregulation rad51, turn, 
impact upon extent chromosomal abnormalities seen in
tat-producing cells. here, asked whether elevation rad51 levels
influences extent viral gene transcription astrocytic cells. our
results demonstrate ectopic expression rad51 enhances basal- 
tat-induced transcription ltr promoter. event requires cooperativity 
from c/ebp family transcription factors including c/ebpbeta c/ebpbeta 
homologous protein (chop). similar tat, showed rad51 interacts with
c/ebpbeta augments interaction dna motif spanning nucleotides
-120 -94 ltr. interestingly, tat exhibited capacity augment 
synergism rad51 c/ebpbeta. results also demonstrate the
level activation ltr chop tat, either alone together, is
elevated presence sw1/snf1 chromatin remodeling complex. these
observations unravel new pathway tat activation ltr includes
the positive feedback loop involving rad51 c/ebpbeta family proteins.
