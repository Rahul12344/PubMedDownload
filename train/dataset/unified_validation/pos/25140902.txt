mitochondria contribute cellular innate immunity rna viruses.
mitochondrial-mediated innate immunity regulated signalling molecules 
are recruited mitochondrial membrane, depends mitochondrial
inner membrane potential (δψm). examine physiological relevance of
δψm mitochondrial-associating influenza viral protein pb1-f2 innate 
immunity. expressed host cells, pb1-f2 completely translocates the
mitochondrial inner membrane space via tom40 channels, accumulation
accelerates mitochondrial fragmentation due reduced δψm. contrast, pb1-f2
variants lacking c-terminal polypeptide, frequently found low
pathogenic subtypes, affect mitochondrial function. pb1-f2-mediated
attenuation δψm suppresses rig-i signalling pathway activation of
nlrp3 inflammasomes. pb1-f2 translocation mitochondria strongly correlates
with impaired cellular innate immunity, making translocation event a
potential therapeutic target.
