background & aims: α-taxilin identified binding partner syntaxins and
is supposed regulate vesicular trafficking. however, physiological
functions α-taxilin potential relevance life cycle of
hepatitis b virus (hbv) still poorly understood.
methods: transfected hepatoma cells, infected primary human hepatocytes, and
liver tissue hbv-infected patients used study expression of
α-taxilin. subcellular localization colocalization analyzed confocal 
laser scanning microscopy (clsm). protein-protein interactions further
investigated co-immunoprecipitations. silencing α-taxilin expression was
performed lentiviral gene transfer.
results: hbv producing cells show significant higher level α-taxilin. hbv
induces α-taxilin expression, regulatory proteins hbx lhbs via c-raf. 
this indicates α-taxilin essential release hbv particles. clsm
and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated pres1pres2 domain lhbs
interacts α-taxilin. α-taxilin harbors yxxl motif represents a
classic late domain. accordance this, found by
co-immunoprecipitations α-taxilin interacts escrt component
tsg101. clsm revealed fraction α-taxilin colocalizes lhbs and
tsg101.
conclusions: α-taxilin plays essential role release hbv-dna containing 
particles. might act adapter binds, one hand, lhbs and,
on hand, tsg101 thereby helps recruit escrt machinery the
viral envelope proteins.
