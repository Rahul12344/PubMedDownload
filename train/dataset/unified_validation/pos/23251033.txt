the hiv-1 tat protein stimulates viral gene expression recruiting human
transcription elongation complexes containing p-tefb, aff4, ell2, enl af9 
to viral promoter, molecular organization complexes remains 
unknown. establish overall architecture hiv-1 tat elongation
complex, mapped binding sites mediate complex assembly vitro and
in vivo. aff4 protein emerges central scaffold recruits other
factors direct interactions short hydrophobic regions along its
structurally disordered axis. direct binding partners cyct1, ell2, enl af9
act bridging components link complex two major elongation
factors, p-tefb paf complex. unique scaffolding properties aff4
allow dynamic flexible assembly multiple elongation factors connect
the components also larger network of
transcriptional regulators.
