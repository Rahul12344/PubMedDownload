nonenveloped viruses undergo conformational changes enable bind to, 
disrupt, penetrate biological membrane leading successful infection. 
assessed whether cytosolic factors play role endoplasmic reticulum
(er) membrane penetration nonenveloped sv40. find cytosolic
sgta-hsc70 complex interacts er transmembrane j-proteins dnajb14 (b14)
and dnajb12 (b12), two cellular factors previously implicated sv40 infection. 
sgta binds directly sv40 completes er membrane penetration. during
er-to-cytosol transport sv40, sgta disengages b14 b12. concomitant
with this, sv40 triggers b14 b12 reorganize discrete foci within 
er membrane. b14 must retain ability form foci interact with
sgta-hsc70 promote sv40 infection. results identify novel role a
cytosolic chaperone membrane penetration nonenveloped virus raise
the possibility sv40-induced foci represent cytosol entry sites.
