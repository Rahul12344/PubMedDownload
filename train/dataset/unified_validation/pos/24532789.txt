interferon regulatory factor (irf) family members implicated as
critical transcription factors function immune responses, hematopoietic
differentiation, cell growth regulation. activation irf5 results the
production pro-inflammatory cytokines tnfα, il6, il12, well 
type interferons. study, demonstrate hiv-2 vpx interacts with
irf5, vpx inhibits irf5-mediated transactivation. expression vpx thp-1 
cells reduced mrna levels protein production toll-like receptor-dependent 
il6, il12p40, tnfα induced lipopolysaccharide, r848, odn2216.
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show vpx expression results in
decreased promoter binding activity irf5. study provides new insights
into mechanisms employed hiv-2 counteract innate immune defenses against
viral infection.
