kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (kshv) encodes d-like cyclin (k-cyclin) 
that thought contribute viral oncogenicity. k-cyclin activates
cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 4 6, generating enzymes a
substrate selectivity deviant cdk4 cdk6 activated d-type cyclins,
suggesting different biochemical biological functions. report the
identification actin- calmodulin-binding protein caldesmon (cald1) 
a novel k-cyclin.cdk substrate, phosphorylated d.cdk. cald1 plays
a central role regulation microfilament organization, consequently
controlling cell shape, adhesion, cytokinesis motility. k-cyclin.cdk6
specifically phosphorylates four ser/thr sites human cald1 carboxyl
terminus, abolishing cald1 binding effector protein, actin, its
regulator protein, calmodulin. cald1 hyperphosphorylated cells following
k-cyclin expression kshv-transformed lymphoma cells. moreover, expression 
of exogenous k-cyclin results microfilament loss changes cell
morphology; effects reliant cdk catalysis reversed 
expression phosphorylation defective cald1. together, data strongly
suggest k-cyclin expression modulates activity caldesmon 
this microfilament functions cells. results establish novel link
between kshv infection regulation actin cytoskeleton.
