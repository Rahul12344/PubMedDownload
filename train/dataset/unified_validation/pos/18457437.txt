epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 5 (ebna5) one first viral proteins
detected primary ebv infection shown required for
efficient transformation b lymphocytes. ebna5 protein many
suggested functions underlying biology remains clarified. gain
further insight biological roles proposed multifunctional ebna5, 
we isolated ebna5 containing protein complexes using modified tandem affinity
purification (tap) method identified protein components lc-ms/ms
analysis tryptic digests ltq-ft-icr mass spectrometer. modified tap
tag contained protein domain streptagii sequence separated two
tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sites fused c-terminus of
ebna5. results confirmed wide applicability two-step affinity
purification strategy purification protein complexes mammalian cells. a
total 147 novel putative ebna5 interaction partners identified, 37 of
which validated lc-ms/ms split-tag experiments co-immuno
precipitates hek293 cell extracts. subgroup included the
bcl2-associated athanogene 2 (bag2) co-chaperone involved protein folding 
renaturation, 26s proteasome subunit 2 involved regulation of
ubiquitin/proteasome protein degradation, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein
m (hnrnp m) involved pre-mrna processing. ebna5 interactors further
verified co-immunoprecipitations cell extracts three ebv-positive
lymphoblastoid lines. combination hsp70, hsc70, bag2 26s
proteasome subunit 2 interactors suggests ebna5 might functional
relationship protein quality control systems recognize proteins with
abnormal structures either refold normal conformation target 
for degradation. study also confirms previously identified interactors
including ha95, hsp70, hsc70, hsp27, hax-1, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, s3a, alpha-
and beta-tubulin.
