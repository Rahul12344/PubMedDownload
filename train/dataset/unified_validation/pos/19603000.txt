the binding coagulation factor x (fx) hexon adenovirus (ad) 5 is
pivotal hepatocyte transduction. however, vectors based ad35, subspecies
b ad, development cancer gene therapy, ad35 utilizes cd46 (which is
upregulated many cancers) transduction. investigated whether
interaction ad35 fx influenced vector tropism using ad5, ad35, and
ad5/ad35 chimeras: ad5/fiber(f)35, ad5/penton(p)35/f35, ad35/f5. surface
plasmon resonance (spr) revealed ad35 ad35/f5 bound fx with
approximately tenfold lower affinities ad5 hexon-containing viruses, and
electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-em) demonstrated direct ad35 hexon:fx
interaction. presence physiological levels fx significantly inhibited
transduction vectors containing ad35 fibers (ad5/f35, ad5/p35/f35, ad35)
in cd46-positive cells. vectors intravenously administered cd46
transgenic mice presence absence fx-binding protein (x-bp),
resulting reduced liver accumulation vectors. moreover, ad5/f35 and
ad5/p35/f35 efficiently accumulated lung, whereas ad5 demonstrated poor
lung targeting. additionally, x-bp significantly reduced lung genome accumulation
for ad5/f35 ad5/p35/f35, whereas ad35 significantly enhanced. summary,
vectors based full ad35 serotype useful vectors selective gene
transfer via cd46 due weaker fx interaction compared ad5.
