the collectins shown role host defense influenza a
virus (iav) significant viral pathogens (e.g., hiv). ficolins a
related group innate immune proteins present relatively high
concentrations serum, also respiratory secretions; however, has
been little study role ficolins viral infection. study, we
demonstrate purified recombinant human h-ficolin h-ficolin human
serum bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bind iav inhibit viral infectivity 
and hemagglutination activity vitro. removal ficolins human serum or
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid reduces antiviral activity. inhibition iav 
did involve calcium-dependent lectin activity h-ficolin. we
demonstrate h-ficolin sialylated removal sialic acid
abrogates iav inhibition, addition neuraminidase inhibitor
oseltamivir potentiates neutralization, hemagglutinin inhibition, viral
aggregation caused h-ficolin. pandemic mouse-adapted strains iav are
generally inhibited collectins surfactant protein mannose binding
lectin paucity glycan attachments hemagglutinin these
strains. contrast, h-ficolin inhibited mouse-adapted pr-8 h1n1 strain
and pandemic h1n1 strain 2009. h-ficolin also fixed complement a
surface coated iav. findings suggest h-ficolin contributes to
host defense iav.
