adeno-associated virus encodes four nonstructural proteins, known as
rep78, rep68, rep52, rep40. expression nonstructural proteins
affects cell growth gene expression processes yet 
characterized. using yeast two-hybrid screen, demonstrated a
stable interaction occurs viral proteins rep78 rep52 the
putative protein kinase prkx, encoded x chromosome. stability
and specificity rep-prkx interaction confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation complexes assembled vitro vivo. overexpressed 
prkx, purified cos cells, shown phosphorylate synthetic
protein kinase (pka) substrate. however, activity dramatically
inhibited stoichiometric amounts rep52 weakly inhibited rep68,
which lacks carboxy-terminal sequence contained rep52. similarly, stable
interaction observed rep78, also contains carboxy-terminal
sequence rep52. stable interaction inhibition also observed between
rep52 catalytic subunit pka. using surface plasmon resonance and
kinetic studies, kis approximately 300 167 nm calculated rep52
with pka prkx, respectively. thus, rep52 rep68 significantly
inhibit trans- autophosphorylation activities kinases. the
biological effects rep78-specific inhibition pka-responsive genes are
illustrated reduction steady-state levels cyclic
amp-responsive-element-binding protein cyclin protein.
