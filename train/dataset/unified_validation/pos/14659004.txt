background: retroviral gag protein central player process of
virion assembly plasma membrane, sufficient induce formation
and release virus-like particles. recent evidence suggests gag may co-opt
the host cell's endocytic machinery facilitate retroviral assembly and
release.
results: search novel partners interacting gag protein the
moloney murine leukemia virus (mo-mulv) via yeast two-hybrid protein-protein 
interaction assay resulted identification endophilin 2, component 
the machinery involved clathrin-mediated endocytosis. demonstrate that
endophilin interacts matrix domain gag protein mo-mulv, 
but human immunodeficiency virus, hiv. exogenously expressed and
endogenous endophilin incorporated mo-mulv viral particles. titration
experiments suggest binding sites inclusion endophilin viral
particles limited saturable. knock-down endophilin small
interfering rna (sirna) effect virion production, overexpression of
endophilin and, lesser extent, several fragments protein, result
in inhibition mo-mulv virion production, hiv virion production.
conclusions: study shows endophilins interact mo-mulv gag and
affect virion production. findings imply endophilin another component
of large complex hijacked retroviruses promote virion
production.
