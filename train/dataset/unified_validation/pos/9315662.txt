maximal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gene expression requires
specific cellular factors addition virus-encoded trans-activator
protein tat rna element tar. developed functional assay, based on
transcriptional activation vitro, identify cellular factors. here, we
describe purification molecular cloning ca150, nuclear protein 
is associated human rna polymerase ii holoenzyme involved in
tat-dependent hiv-1 transcriptional activation. sequence ca150 contains an
extensive glutamine- alanine-rich repeat found transcriptional
modulators gal11 ssn6 saccharomyces cerevisiae zeste in
drosophila melanogaster. immunodepletion ca150 abolished tat trans activation 
in vitro. moreover, overexpression mutant ca150 protein specifically and
dramatically decreased tat-mediated activation hiv-1 promoter vivo,
strongly suggesting role ca150 hiv-1 gene regulation.
immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated ca150 tat associate
with rna polymerase ii holoenzyme. furthermore, found functional tat 
associates holoenzyme whereas activation-deficient tat mutants not.
thus, propose tat action transduced via rna polymerase ii
holoenzyme contains ca150.
