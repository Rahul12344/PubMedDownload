dengue virus (denv) causes fever severe haemorrhagic symptoms humans. 
den2 16681 strain, derived dengue haemorrhagic fever patient, been
widely used studies related denv pathogenesis, mouse non-human 
primate haemorrhagic models human vascular endothelial-cell permeability. 
clarify entry mechanism 16681 strain, characterized novel cell
receptor strain. two major findings follows: firstly, the
sdc2 membrane protein effective den2 16681 receptor cloned k562 cell 
line. secondly, heparan sulfate (hs) glycochain (of four glycochains sdc2)
is specific binding site denv seems involved tissue-culture
adaptation. findings present entry mechanism could implicated 
denv adaptation hs-mediated denv infection.
