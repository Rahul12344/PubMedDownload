epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear antigen leader protein (ebna-lp) consists of
w1w2 repeats unique c-terminal y1y2 domain plays critical role in
ebv-induced transformation. identify cellular proteins associating with
ebna-lp, performed yeast two-hybrid screen using ebna-lp cdna containing a
single w1w2 domain bait ebv-transformed human peripheral blood
lymphocyte cdna library source cellular genes. results as
follows. (i) cdna positive yeast colony found encode cellular
protein, human oestrogen-related receptor 1 (herr1), constitutive
transcriptional activator various types oestrogen response elements.
(ii) purified chimeric protein consisting glutathione s-transferase (gst)
fused herr1 specifically formed complexes ebna-lps containing one
(ebna-lpr1), two (ebna-lpr2) four w1w2 repeats (ebna-lpr4) transiently
expressed cos-7 cells. reciprocally, gst fused ebna-lpr1 ebna-lpr2
pulled herr1 transiently expressed cos-7 cells. (iii) mutational analyses
of ebna-lp revealed y2 domain ebna-lp responsible the
interaction herr1 two leucines y2 domain (leu-78 -82), 
are conserved among subset primate gammaherpesviruses, interactive sites
for herr1. far, reported domain ebna-lp critical 
for ebv-induced transformation y1y2 domain. potential roles herr1 in
ebv-induced transformation discussed.
