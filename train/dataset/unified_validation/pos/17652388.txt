cells infected wild-type herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) show disruption
of organization nuclear lamina underlies nuclear envelope.
this disruption reflected changes localization phosphorylation
of lamin proteins. here, show hsv-1 infection causes relocalization of
the lem domain protein emerin. cells infected wild-type virus, emerin
becomes mobile nuclear membrane, cells infected viruses
that fail express ul34 protein (pul34) us3 protein (pus3), emerin no
longer colocalizes lamins, suggesting infection causes loss of
connection emerin lamina. infection causes hyperphosphorylation
of emerin manner dependent upon pul34 pus3. emerin
hyperphosphorylation inhibited protein kinase cdelta (pkcdelta)
inhibitor rottlerin. emerin pul34 interact physically, shown pull-down 
and coimmunoprecipitation assays. emerin expression not, however, necessary
for infection, since virus growth impaired cells derived from
emerin-null transgenic mice. results suggest model pus3 and
pkcdelta recruited pul34 hyperphosphorylate emerin, leading to
disruption connections lamin proteins contributing the
disruption nuclear lamina. changes emerin localization, nuclear shape, 
and lamin organization characteristic cells infected wild-type hsv-1 also
occur cells infected recombinant virus make viral capsids, 
suggesting changes occur independently capsid envelopment.
