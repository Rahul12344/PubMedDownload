persistent infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) lead high risk for
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). hcv core protein plays important roles in
hcv-related hepatocarcinogenesis, mice carrying core protein exhibit 
multicentric hccs without hepatic inflammation fibrosis. however, precise
mechanism hepatocarcinogenesis transgenic mice remains unclear. to
evaluate whether core protein modulates hepatocyte proliferation and
apoptosis vivo, examined parameters 9- 22-month-old transgenic
mice. although numbers apoptotic hepatocytes hepatic caspase 3
activities similar transgenic nontransgenic mice, numbers of
proliferating hepatocytes levels numerous proteins cyclin d1, 
cyclin-dependent kinase 4 c-myc, markedly increased age-dependent 
manner transgenic mice. increase correlated activation
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (pparalpha). these
transgenic mice, spontaneous persistent pparalpha activation occurred
heterogeneously, different observed mice treated with
clofibrate, potent peroxisome proliferator. demonstrated that
stabilization pparalpha possible interaction hcv core protein
and increase nonesterified fatty acids, may serve endogenous
pparalpha ligands, hepatocyte nuclei contributed core protein-specific 
pparalpha activation. conclusion, results offer first suggestion
that hcv core protein induces spontaneous, persistent, age-dependent and
heterogeneous activation pparalpha transgenic mice, may contribute to
the age-dependent multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis mediated core
protein.
