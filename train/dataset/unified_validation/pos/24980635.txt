background: chemokine receptors (ckrs), mainly ccr5 cxcr4 function as
major coreceptors infections caused human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
simian immunodeficiency virus (siv). approximately 20 g protein-coupled receptors
(gpcrs) identified minor coreceptors, alike ccr6 reported
recently. since ckr-l3 indentified natural isoform ccr6, attempted 
in study explore coreceptor function ckr-l3.
methods: np-2 cells transduced cd4-receptor (np-2/cd4) normally remain
resistant hiv siv infection. however, introduction functional
coreceptors make cells susceptible viruses. np-2/cd4/ckr-l3
cells produced examine coreceptor activity ckr-l3. likely,
ccr6-isoform major coreceptors, ccr5 cxcr4 also examined in
parallel. presence viral antigen infected np-2/cd4/coreceptor cells was
detected indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa). results validated
by detection syncytia, proviral dna measuring reverse transcriptase
(rt) activities.
results: hiv-2mir sivsme660 found infect np-2/cd4/ckr-l3 cells,
indicative coreceptor function ckr-l3. viral antigens appeared faster
in np-2/cd4/ckr-l3 cells np-2/cd4/ccr6, indicating ckr-l3 
efficient coreceptor. moreover, syncytia formation rapid rt release 
evidenced earlier higher levels ckr-l3 ccr6. sequence
analysis c2-v3 envelope region hiv-2mir replicated ckr-l3 and
ccr6 coreceptor showed two three amino acid substitutions respectively, in
the c2 region compared ccr5-variant. sivsme660-ckrl3 variant showed
three amino acid substitutions v1 region, one change v2 two
changes c2 region. sivsme660-ccr6 variant produced two changes 
v1 region, three c2 region.
conclusions: isoform ckr-l3 exhibited coreceptor activity limited primary hiv
and siv isolates better efficiency parent ccr6-isoform. amino acid 
substitutions envelope region viruses may confer selective
pressure towards ckr-l3-use. ckr-l3 minor coreceptors may contribute
to hiv siv pathogenesis including dissemination, trafficking latency
especially major coreceptors become compromised. however, works will
be required determine clinical significance hiv siv infection.
