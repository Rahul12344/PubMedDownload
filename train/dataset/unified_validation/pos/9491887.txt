the hiv-1 tat protein regulates transcription elongation binding the
viral tar rna stem-loop structure. isolated novel 87 kda cyclin
c-related protein (cyclin t) interacts specifically transactivation
domain tat. cyclin partner cdk9, rnapii transcription elongation
factor. remarkably, interaction tat cyclin strongly enhances the
affinity specificity tat:tar rna interaction, confers a
requirement sequences loop tar recognized tat
alone. moreover, overexpression human cyclin rescues tat activity in
nonpermissive rodent cells. propose tat directs cyclin t-cdk9 rnapii
through cooperative binding tar rna.
