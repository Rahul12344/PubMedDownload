latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1), encoded epstein-barr virus, required 
ebv-mediated b cell transformation plays significant role the
development posttransplant b cell lymphomas. lmp1 also implicated 
exacerbation autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus. lmp1 is
a constitutively active functional mimic tumor necrosis factor receptor
superfamily member cd40, utilizing tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
factor (traf) adaptor proteins induce signaling. however, lmp1-mediated b cell
activation amplified sustained compared cd40. previously
shown lmp1 cd40 use trafs 1, 2, 3, 5 differently. traf6 important
for cd40 signaling, role traf6 lmp1 signaling b cells not
clear. although traf6 binds directly cd40, traf6 interaction lmp1 b
cells characterized. tested hypothesis traf6 a
critical regulator lmp1 signaling b cells, either part a
receptor-associated complex and/or cytoplasmic adaptor protein. using
traf6-deficient b cells, determined traf6 critical lmp1-mediated 
b cell activation. although cd40-mediated traf6-dependent signaling not
require traf6 receptor-binding domain, found lmp1 signaling required 
the presence domain. furthermore, traf6 recruited lmp1
signaling complex via traf1/2/3/5 binding site within cytoplasmic domain 
of lmp1.
