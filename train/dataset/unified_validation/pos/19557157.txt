human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) persists latent state within
resting cd4+ cells infected persons treated highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart). reservoir must eliminated the
clearance infection. using cdna library screen, identified
methyl-cpg binding domain protein 2 (mbd2) regulator hiv-1 latency. two
cpg islands flank hiv-1 transcription start site methylated in
latently infected jurkat cells primary cd4+ cells. mbd2 histone
deacetylase 2 (hdac2) found one cpg islands latency.
inhibition cytosine methylation 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (aza-cdr) abrogates
recruitment mbd2 hdac2. furthermore, aza-cdr potently synergizes 
nf-kappab activators prostratin tnf-alpha reactivate latent hiv-1. these
observations confirm cytosine methylation mbd2 epigenetic regulators
of hiv-1 latency. clearance hiv-1 infected persons may enhanced by
inclusion dna methylation inhibitors, aza-cdr, nf-kappab
activators current antiviral therapies.
