the molecular mechanisms mediating herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) gene
silencing latent infection clear. five copies early growth
response gene 1 (egr-1) binding elements identified intron hsv-1
icp22 (infected cell protein no. 22) gene, leading hypothesis egr-1
binds viral genome regulates viral gene expression. transient
co-transfection assays indicated egr-1 negatively regulated the
transcription full-length intron-removed icp22 promoters. same
assays also revealed egr-1 repressed icp4 (infected cell protein no. 4)
promoter activity dose-dependent manner showed less inhibition 
intron removed. histone deacetylation involved regulation
since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin exhibit effect 
egr-1-mediated repression. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed egr-1
reduced binding sp1 promoters co-repressor nab2
(ngfi-a/egr1-binding protein) recruited proximity icp4 the
presence egr-1. results suggested multifunctional transcription
factor egr-1 repress hsv-1 immediate-early gene expression the
recruitment co-repressor nab2 reduction sp1 occupancy, thus may
play critical role hsv-1 gene silencing latency.
