cellular ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases (ephrin receptors, ephs) found 
interact efficiently gh/gl glycoprotein complex rhesus monkey
rhadinovirus (rrv). since epha2 recently identified receptor the
kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) (hahn et al., nature medicine
2012), analyzed rrv kshv parallel respect eph-binding and
eph-dependent entry. ten 14 eph proteins, including a- b-type,
interacted rrv gh/gl. two rrv strains markedly different gh/gl
sequences exhibited similar slightly different binding patterns ephs.
gh/gl kshv displayed high affinity towards epha2 substantially weaker
binding ephs a-type. productive entry rrv 26-95
into b cells endothelial cells essentially completely dependent upon
ephs since expression gfp reporter cassette recombinant virus could 
blocked greater 95% soluble eph decoys using cells. contrast,
entry rrv fibroblasts epithelial cells independent ephs by
these criteria. even high concentrations mixtures soluble eph decoys 
were able reduce appreciable extent number fibroblasts and
epithelial cells productively entered rrv. thus, rrv similar close
relative kshv use eph family receptors productive entry b
cells endothelial cells. however, rrv uses separate, distinct,
eph-independent pathway productive entry fibroblasts epithelial
cells. whether kshv also uses eph-independent pathway circumstances or
to extent remains determined.
