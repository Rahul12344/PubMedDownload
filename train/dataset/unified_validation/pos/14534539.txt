the adenovirus e4orf6 viral oncoprotein known cooperate e1a gene
product transforming primary murine cells. shown inhibit the
apoptotic activities p53 p73 direct binding proteins.
here, demonstrate adenovirus e4orf6 protein inhibits apoptosis
mediated bnip3 bik, bh3-only proteins bcl-2 family. 
activity mediated p53 p73 e4orf6 effect on
the apoptosis saos-2 cells express p53-related genes. also 
ascertained e4orf6 could change mitochondrial localization bnip3 
bik. mutant lacking nuclear export signal e4orf6 failed inhibit
apoptosis translocate bnip3 protein mitochondria. moreover, it
was also established e4orf6 able interact bnip3 bik. in
bnip3 protein, region required interaction included transmembrane
domain, required localization bnip3 mitochondria.
these results suggest e4orf6 exported nucleus cytoplasm, 
enabling interact bh3-only proteins, eventually leading the
inhibition apoptotic activity.
