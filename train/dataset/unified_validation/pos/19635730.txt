va rna(i) non-coding adenoviral transcript counteracts host cell
anti-viral defenses immune responses mediated via pkr. investigated
potential alternate secondary structure conformations within pkr-binding
domain va rna(i) using site-directed mutagenesis, rna uv-melting analysis 
enzymatic rna secondary structure probing. latter data clearly indicated that
the wild-type va rna(i) apical stem adopt two different conformations and
that exists mixed population two structures. contrast, two
sequence variants designed eliminate one possible structures, 
leaving intact, formed unique secondary structure. this
clarification apical stem pairing also suggests small alteration 
apical stem-loop secondary structure. relative ability two apical stem
conformations bind pkr inhibit kinase activity measured isothermal 
titration calorimetry pkr autophosphorylation inhibition assay. found that
the two sequence variants displayed markedly different activities, one being
a significantly poorer binder inhibitor pkr. whether presence the
va rna(i) conformation reduced pkr inhibitory activity directly
beneficial virus cell function requires further
investigation.
