we report mdm2, negative regulator p53, bind ebna-5. using gst
pull-down assay, immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance and
immunostaining lymphoblastoid cells, found trimolecular complexes 
formed ebna-5, mdm2 p53, mdm2 serves bridge. ebna-5
binding mdm2 counteracted destabilizing effect latter p53. in
ubiquitination degradation assays vitro, ebna-5 inhibited p53
polyubiquitination (but monoubiquitination) concentration-dependent
manner. resembles effect p14arf p53. moreover, ebna-5 found to
inhibit degradation p53 vitro. high levels p53 expression were
maintained lcls. binding ebna-5 mdm2 also could impair the
functional activity p53. p53-dependent genes p21 vdr induced 
in ebv-infected, contrast mitogen-activated cells. may explain the
tolerance established lcls high levels p53 without undergoing apoptosis.
