apoptosis plays important roles host defense, including elimination of
virus-infected cells. executioners apoptosis caspase family proteases.
we report vaccinia virus-encoded f1l protein, previously recognized as
anti-apoptotic viral bcl-2 family protein, caspase-9 inhibitor. f1l binds to
and specifically inhibits caspase-9, apical protease mitochondrial
cell death pathway failing inhibit caspases. cells, f1l
inhibits apoptosis proteolytic processing caspases induced by
overexpression caspase-9 caspase-8. n-terminal region f1l
preceding bcl-2-like fold accounts caspase-9 inhibition significantly
contributes anti-apoptotic activity f1l. viral f1l thus provides the
first example caspase inhibition bcl-2 family member; functions both
as suppressor proapoptotic bcl-2 family proteins inhibitor of
caspase-9, thereby neutralizing two sequential steps mitochondrial cell
death pathway.
