background: hepatitis b virus-encoded x protein shown capable of
activating many different viral cellular promoters protein-protein
interactions contribute development hepatocellular carcinoma. as
its mechanism yet identified unequivocally, aim present
study screen cellular proteins interact x protein.
methods: yeast two-hybrid system used screen x-interactive
protein. false positive clones eliminated segregation analysis, 
putative positive clones amplified, sequenced analyzed with
bioinformatics. mating experiment performed confirm binding of
putative proteins x protein yeast cells. specific interaction
between x protein putative proteins mammalian cells verified by
coimmunoprecipitation.
results: hepatitis b virus x-interactive protein recovered human liver
cdna library cytochrome c oxidase iii. specific interaction between
protein x cytochrome c oxidase iii verified mating experiment and
coimmunoprecipitation cos7 cell lysates expressing proteins.
conclusion: data support speculation cytochrome c oxidase iii a
novel functional target hepatitis b virus x protein cells.
