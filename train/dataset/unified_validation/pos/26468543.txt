multiple receptors may exist. lec2 chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells sia
deficient resistant iav infection. demonstrate expression
of c-type lectin receptor langerin lec2 cells (lec2-lg) rendered them
permissive iav infection, measured replication viral genome,
transcription viral mrna, synthesis viral proteins. unlike
sia-dependent infection parental cho cells, iav attachment infection of
lec2-lg cells mediated via lectin-mediated recognition mannose-rich
glycans expressed viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein. lec2 cells expressing 
endocytosis-defective langerin bound iav efficiently remained resistant to
iav infection, confirming internalization via langerin essential for
infectious entry. langerin-mediated infection lec2-lg cells ph dynamin
dependent, occurred via clathrin- caveolin-mediated endocytic pathways, and
utilized early (rab5(+)) late (rab7(+)) endosomes. study the

the major attachment factor influenza viruses (iav). however, studies
have identified specific transmembrane receptors bind internalize iav to
facilitate infection. identify human langerin transmembrane

resistant iav rendered cells permissive infection. langerin represented 
the sole receptor iav infection system, defined pathways 
and compartments involved infectious entry iav cells following
recognition langerin.
