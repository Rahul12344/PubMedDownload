chikungunya virus (chikv) mosquito-transmitted alphavirus been
responsible epidemic outbreak unprecedented magnitude recent years. 
since then, significant efforts made better understand biology
of virus, still poor knowledge chikv interactions host
cell components molecular level. describe extensive use of
high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (ht-y2h) assays characterize interactions
between chikv human proteins. total 22 high-confidence interactions,
which essentially involved viral nonstructural protein nsp2, identified 
and validated protein complementation assay (pca). results 
integrated larger network obtained extensive mining literature for
reports alphavirus-host interactions. investigate role cellular
proteins interacting nsp2, gene silencing experiments performed in
cells infected recombinant chikv expressing renilla luciferase a
reporter. collected data showed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein k
(hnrnp-k) ubiquilin 4 (ubqln4) participate chikv replication vitro. 
addition, showed chikv nsp2 induces cellular shutoff, previously
reported old world alphaviruses, determined among binding
partners identified yeast two-hybrid methods, tetratricopeptide repeat
protein 7b (ttc7b) plays significant role activity. altogether, this
report provides first interaction map chikv human proteins and
describes new host cell proteins involved replication cycle virus.
