the tax protein human t-cell leukemia virus (htlv) activates the
expression viral mrna three 21 bp repeat enhancer located within the
htlv-1 ltr. since tax bind 21 bp dna repeats directly, has
been speculated tax interacts cellular protein(s) mediate binding
to enhancer. employed yeast two hybrid system identify host
proteins potentially relevant tax transactivation. identified a
tax binding protein encoded cdna expression library derived from
peripheral blood lymphocytes. corresponding cdna sequence identity a
known transcription factor, activating factor-4 (atf-4). atf-4 also binds to
gst-tax fusion protein vitro. tax mutants transactivate the
htlv-1 ltr also failed bind atf-4. critical domain tax binding resides
in 85 amino acid stretch c-terminus atf-4, contains basic
domain leucine zipper. demonstrated full length and
n-terminal truncated atf-4 able enhance tax transactivation. thus, atf-4 
may act adapter tax tre (tax responsive element), play 
an important role tax-mediated transactivation.
