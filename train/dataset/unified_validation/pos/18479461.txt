human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv16) dna replication, requires two viral
proteins e1 e2, occurs differentiating epithelium. besides the
general factors necessary cellular dna synthesis, unidentified cellular
factors assumed involved regulation hpv dna replication. in
the present study, found pou-domain transcription factor human
skn-1a, induces terminal differentiation keratinocytes activates
the hpv16 late promoter, enhanced transient replication plasmid
containing hpv16 replication origin hek293 cells co-transfected 
a plasmid expressing e1 e2. electrophoretic mobility shift assay a
bacterially expressed human skn-1a extract hela cells over-expressing
human skn-1a revealed presence two human skn-1a binding sites are
distinct known three sites, near replication origin. chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis showed human skn-1a bound sites in
cells. nucleotide substitutions sites abolished binding human
skn-1a human skn-1a-mediated replication enhancement. data strongly
suggest that, binding two sites, human skn-1a enhances hpv dna
replication.
