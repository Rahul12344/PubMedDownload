hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns5a protein transcriptionally modulates number of
cellular genes. since evidence binding ns5a protein dna, 
is likely exert activity concert cellular factor(s). this
study, identified specific interaction hcv ns5a homeodomain
protein ptx1 human origin yeast two-hybrid interacting cloning system.
the authenticity interaction verified mammalian two-hybrid assay, 
in vivo co-immunoprecipitation analysis, colocalization study.
recently, murine ptx1 (mptx1) shown repress virus-induced murine
interferona4 promoter activity. interferon-à alone together ribavirin 
the available therapy hcv-infected patients. therefore, examined
whether coexpression ns5a human ptx1 (hptx1) proteins modulate human ifn-à
promoter activity. vitro reporter assay transfection hepg2 cells with
ns5a suggested activation ifn-à promoter approximately 20-fold upon
newcastle disease virus (ndv) infection. similar experimental conditions,
hptx1-activated ifn-à prompter approximately sevenfold, unlike mptx1. however,
cotransfection ns5a hptx1 displayed lower interferon promoter activity, 
probably physical association two proteins. subsequent study
demonstrated activation ifn promoter ns5a associated an
increased expression irf-3. analysis revealed ectopic expression 
of ns5a hepg2 cells enhances endogenous ifn-à secretion mxa expression
upon induction ndv. however, exogenous expression hptx1 not
significantly alter ns5a-mediated function stable transfectants. taken
together, results suggested level endogenous hptx1 not
sufficient block function ns5a augmentation virus-mediated ifn
activity hepg2 cells.
