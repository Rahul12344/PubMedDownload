cervical carcinoma predominant cancer among malignancies women
throughout world, human papillomavirus (hpv) 16 common agent 
linked human cervical carcinoma. present study performed to
investigate mechanisms immune escape hpv-induced cervical cancer cells.
the presence hpv oncoproteins e6 e7 extracellular fluids of
hpv-containing cervical cancer cell lines siha caski demonstrated by
elisa. effect hpv 16 oncoproteins e6 e7 production ifn-gamma
by il-18 assessed. e6 e7 proteins reduced il-18-induced ifn-gamma
production primary pbmcs nk0 cell line. facs analysis revealed
that viral oncoproteins reduced binding il-18 cellular surface 
receptors nk0 cells, whereas effect oncoproteins il-1
binding surface il-1 receptors d10s, subclone murine th cell
d10.g4.1. vitro pull-down assays also revealed viral oncoproteins and
il-18 bound il-18r alpha-chain competitively. results suggest the
extracellular hpv 16 e6 e7 proteins may inhibit il-18-induced ifn-gamma
production locally hpv lesions inhibition il-18 binding its
alpha-chain receptor. down-modulation il-18-induced immune responses hpv
oncoproteins may contribute viral pathogenesis carcinogenesis.
