reactivation epstein-barr virus (ebv) latency dependent expression 
of viral transactivator bzlf1 protein, whose promoter (zp) normally exhibits 
only low basal activity activated response chemical biological
inducers. using reporter assay system, screened factors can
activate zp isolated genes, including encoding mef2b, klf4, some
cellular b-zip family transcription factors. confirming importance
and functional binding sites reporter assays, prepared recombinant ebv-bac,
in binding sites mutated. interestingly, mef2 mutant virus
produced low levels brlf1, another transactivator ebv, addition 
bzlf1 hek293 cells. virus failed induce subset early genes, such
as encoding balf5, upon lytic induction, accordingly, could not
replicate produce progeny viruses hek293 cells, restriction could 
be completely lifted exogenous supply brlf1, together bzlf1. b
cells, induction bzlf1 chemical inducers inhibited point mutations
in zii three sp1/klf binding sites ebv-bac zp, leaky bzlf1
expression less affected. mutation mef2 sites severely impaired both
spontaneous induced expression bzlf1, also brlf1 in
comparison wild-type revertant virus cases. also observed mef2
mutant ebv featured relatively high repressive histone methylation, as
h3k27me3, cpg dna methylation levels comparable around zp brlf1 
promoter (rp). findings shed light bzlf1 expression ebv reactivation
from latency.
