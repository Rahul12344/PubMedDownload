tat may stimulate transcriptional elongation recruitment complex
containing tat-sf1 kinase human immunodeficiency virus-type 1
(hiv-1) promoter tat-tar interaction. complementary dna the
cellular activity, tat-sf1, isolated. factor required tat
trans-activation substrate associated cellular kinase.
cotransfection complementary dna tat-sf1 specifically modulates tat 
activation. tat-sf1 contains two rna recognition motifs highly acidic
carboxyl-terminal half. distantly related ews fus/tls, members 
family putative transcription factors rna recognition motifs are
associated sarcomas.
