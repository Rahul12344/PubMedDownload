background: hepatitis e virus (hev) major causative agent acute clinical 
hepatitis adults throughout much asia, middle east, africa. the
lack efficient cell culture system hev greatly limited our
understanding mechanisms infection, replication, pathogenicity of
this virus. yeast two-hybridization system considered efficient
method determining protein-protein interactions screening interactive
proteins associated host cells.
objectives: order identify host-cell proteins interacting the
hev-capsid proteins, fragment hev-capsid protein p239 (amino acids
368-606) used bait; human liver cdna library used source of
host-cell proteins, screening performed using cytotrap yeast
two-hybrid system.
materials methods: cytotrap yeast two-hybrid system, also called
sos recruitment system (srs), used analyze interaction p239
fragment host-cell proteins.
results: isolated 2 proteins, cytochrome p4502c8 (cyp4502c8) and
retinol-binding protein 4 (rbp4) 2 rounds screening.
co-immunoprecipitation assays showed proteins could bind vitro
to hev virion hepg2 cells.
conclusions: cyp4502c8 rbp4 screened liver cdna library using the
cytotrap yeast two-hybrid system interact hev capsid vitro.
