interference vp16-mediated activation herpes virus immediate-early (or
alpha) genes thought major cause establishing viral latency in
sensory neurons. could brought lack key activating
transcription factor(s) active repression. study find sensory 
neurons express important components vp16-mediated alpha gene induction, 
such pou transcription factor oct-1, host cell factor (hcf) gabp
alpha/beta. however, oct-1 gabp alpha/beta present low levels and
the vp16-induced complex (vic) appears different. find protein
expression transcription factor oct-2, implicated others alpha
gene repressor. pou factor n-oct3 (brn 2 pou3f2) also present in
sensory neurons binds viral taatgarat motifs higher affinity oct-1,
indicating may candidate repressor competitive binding to
taatgarat motifs. transfected hela cells, oct-1 gabp
alpha/beta highly abundant, n-oct3 represses model promoters with
multimerized taatgarat motifs, fails repress complete alpha gene
promoters. taken together findings suggest modulation alpha gene
promoters could contribute viral latency low concentrations the
activating transcription factors oct-1 gabp alpha/beta prevail. data,
however, refute notion competing oct factors able block alpha
gene transcription achieve viral latency.
