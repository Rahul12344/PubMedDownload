this study describes physical functional interactions icp0 of
herpes simplex virus type 1 class ii histone deacetylases (hdacs) 4, 5, and
7. class ii hdacs mainly known participation control cell
differentiation regulation activity transcription
factor mef2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2), implicated muscle development and
neuronal survival. immunofluorescence experiments performed transfected cells 
showed icp0 colocalizes reorganizes nuclear distribution of
ectopically expressed class ii hdacs. addition, endogenous hdac4 
least one binding partners, corepressor protein smrt (for silencing
mediator retinoid thyroid receptor), undergo changes nuclear
distribution icp0-transfected cells. result, infection endogenous 
hdac4 colocalizes icp0. coimmunoprecipitation glutathione s-transferase 
pull-down assays confirmed class ii class hdacs specifically
interacted icp0 amino-terminal regions. region, 
not conserved class hdacs homologous mitr (mef2-interacting
transcription repressor) protein, responsible repression, a
deacetylase-independent manner, mef2 sequestering inactive form
in nucleus. consequently, show icp0 able overcome hdac5
amino-terminal- mitr-induced mef2a repression gene reporter assays. this
is first report viral protein interacting controlling the
repressor activity class ii hdacs. discuss putative consequences of
such interaction biology virus lytic infection 
reactivation latency.
