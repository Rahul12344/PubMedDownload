hepatitis b virus (hbv) core protein (hbc) major component viral
nucleocapsid multifunctional protein involved viral maturation and
release. unstable present cells low level k96 lysine
residue, ubiquitin acceptor site. np95/icbp90-like ring finger protein
(nirf) auto-ubiquitination activity hallmark ubiquitin
ligase. present study, ubiquitin ligase, nirf, binds hbc leads to
the proteasome-mediated degradation hbc vivo. nirf down-regulates hbc
protein level, resulting decrease amount hbv particles in
supernatant hepg2.2.15 cells. however knockdown nirf significantly
increases endogenous hbc protein level, leading hbv release. results
reveal nirf interacts hbc promotes degradation hbc vivo. 
the pathway nirf-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome affects release hbv
particles controlling amounts hbc. indicates nirf may
participate maturation hbv.
