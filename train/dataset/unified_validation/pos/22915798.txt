severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) etiological agent
of sars, fatal pulmonary disorder effective treatment. found that
sars-cov spike glycoprotein (s protein), key molecule viral entry, binds to
calnexin, molecular chaperone endoplasmic reticulum (er), to
calreticulin, homolog calnexin. calnexin bound truncated mutants 
s protein, protein bound mutants calnexin. pseudotyped virus
carrying protein (s-pseudovirus) produced human cells treated with
small interfering rna (sirna) calnexin expression (calnexin sirna-treated
cells) showed significantly lower infectivity s-pseudoviruses produced by
untreated control sirna-treated cells. s-pseudovirus produced calnexin
sirna-treated cells contained protein modified n-glycan side chains
differently two proteins consisted two kinds viral
particles: normal density little protein high
density abundant protein. treatment peptide-n-glycosidase f (pngase
f), removes types n-glycan side chains glycoproteins,
eliminated infectivity s-pseudovirus. s-pseudovirus sars-cov produced 
in presence Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, disrupt interaction
between calnexin substrates, showed significantly lower infectivity 
each virus produced absence compounds. s-pseudovirus, the
incorporation protein viral particles obviously inhibited. in
sars-cov, viral production obviously inhibited. findings demonstrated
that calnexin strictly monitors maturation protein direct
binding, resulting conferring infectivity sars-cov.
