background: concurrent sexually transmitted infections (stis) increase the
likelihood hiv transmission. levels defensins frequently elevated
in genital fluids individuals stis. previously shown human
defensins 5 6 (hd5 hd6) promote hiv entry contribute neisseria
gonorrhoeae-mediated enhancement hiv infectivity vitro. study, we
dissect molecular mechanism hiv enhancing effect defensins.
results: hd5 hd6 primarily acted virion promote hiv infection. both
hd5 hd6 antagonized anti-hiv activities inhibitors hiv entry (tak
779) fusion (t-20) inhibitors present viral
attachment; however, inhibitors added back viral infection
they overrode hiv enhancing effect defensins. hd5 hd6 enhanced hiv
infectivity promoting hiv attachment target cells. studies using
fluorescent hiv containing vpr-gfp indicated defensins enhanced hiv
attachment concentrating virus particles target cells. hd5 hd6
blocked anti-hiv activities soluble glycosaminoglycans including heparin,
chondroitin sulfate, dextran sulfate. however, heparin, high
concentration, diminished hiv enhancing effect hd5, hd6.
additionally, degree hiv enhancing effect hd5, hd6, was
increased heparinase-treated cells. results suggest hd5 and
haparin/heparan sulfate compete binding hiv.
conclusions: hd5 hd6 increased hiv infectivity concentrating virus 
target cells. defensins may negative effect efficacy of
microbicides, especially setting stis.
