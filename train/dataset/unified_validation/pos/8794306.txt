it well established human immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1) nef
contributes substantially disease pathogenesis augmenting virus replication
and markedly perturbing t-cell function. effect nef host cell
activation could explained part interaction specific cellular
proteins involved signal transduction, including least member src 
family kinase, lck, serine/threonine kinase, mitogen-activated protein
kinase (mapk). recombinant nef directly interacted purified lck mapk

conserved bears strong resemblance defined consensus sequence identified
as sh3 binding domain present several proteins interact

cascades, including emanating t-cell receptor, hiv-1 nef
protein undoubtedly alters ability infected cell respond to

hiv-1-induced disease pathogenesis.
