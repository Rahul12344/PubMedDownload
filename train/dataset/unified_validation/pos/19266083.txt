host signal-transduction pathways intimately involved switch between
latency productive infection herpes viruses. herpes viruses,
infection kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (kshv) displays two phases.
during latency viral genes expressed, productive
infection virus reactivated initiation extensive viral dna
replication gene expression, resulting production new viral particles. 
viral reactivation crucial kshv pathogenesis contributes the
progression ks. recently identified pim-1 kinase reactivating
kshv upon over-expression. show another pim family kinase, pim-3,
also induces viral reactivation. demonstrate expression pim-1 and
pim-3 induced response physiological chemical reactivation in
naturally kshv-infected cells, show required kshv
reactivation conditions. furthermore, data indicate pim-1
and pim-3 contribute viral reactivation phosphorylating kshv
latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) serine residues 205 206. this
counteracts lana-mediated repression kshv lytic gene transcription.
the identification pim family kinases novel cellular regulators the
gammaherpesvirus life cycle facilitates deeper understanding virus-host
interactions reactivation may represent potential novel targets for
therapeutic intervention.
