the hepatitis e virus causes acute viral hepatitis endemic much the
developing world serious public health problem. however, due lack
of vitro culture system small animal model, biology and
pathogenesis poorly understood. shown earlier orf3 protein
(porf3) hepatitis e virus activates erk, member mapk superfamily.
here explored mechanism porf3-mediated erk activation and
demonstrated independent raf/mek pathway. using biochemical
assays, yeast two-hybrid analysis, intracellular fluorescence resonance
energy transfer showed porf3 binds pyst1, prototypic member the
erk-specific mapk phosphatase. binding regions two proteins were
mapped n terminus porf3 central portion pyst1. expression of
porf3 protected erk inhibitory effects ectopically expressed pyst1.
this first example viral protein regulating erk activation by
inhibition cognate dual specificity phosphatase.
