the mechanism cd4+ cell depletion hiv-infected patients poorly
understood. study investigated whether rgp120 activate the
complement system absence anti-gp120 abs. found complement 
proteins c4, c3d, c5b-9, properdin bind rgp 120-coated cd4+ cells of
healthy individuals incubated autologous serum. activation the
complement system occurred primarily via classical pathway abolished 
in sera deficient c1q c4 well presence edta. cell lysis
was observed lymphocytotoxicity assay using human serum, possibly of
homologous restriction complement lysis. contrast, addition rabbit sera 
induced lysis rgp 120-precoated cells. cell lysis rabbit serum was
found naturally occurring igm anti-gp 120 abs. rgp 120,
which immobilized surface microtiter plates activated complement in
the absence lymphocytes. complement activation cell-bound hiv-1 envelope
glycoprotein gp120 subsequent opsonization may relevant the
elimination noninfected cd4+ cells hiv-infected patients.
