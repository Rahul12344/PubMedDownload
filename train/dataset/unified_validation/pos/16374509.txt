we determined human genome contain 296 different src homology-3 (sh3)
domains cloned phage-display vector. provided powerful and
unbiased system simultaneous assaying complete human sh3 proteome 
the strongest binding target proteins interest, without limitations
posed short linear peptide ligands confounding variables indirect
methods protein interaction screening. studies involving three ligand
proteins, human immunodeficiency virus-1 nef, p21-activated kinase (pak)2 and
adam15, showed previously reported well novel sh3 partners nanomolar
affinities specific them. argues sh3 domains may more
dominant role directing cellular protein interactions assumed.
besides showing potentially important new sh3-directed interactions, these
studies also led discovery novel signalling proteins, the
pak2-binding adaptor protein posh2 adam15-binding sorting nexin family
member snx30.
