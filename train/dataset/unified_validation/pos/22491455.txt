ebna1 nuclear epstein-barr virus (ebv) protein expressed both
latent lytic modes infection. ebna1 known play several
important roles latent infection, reason continued expression in
lytic infection unknown. identified two roles ebna1 the
reactivation latent ebv lytic cycle epithelial cells. first, ebna1
depletion latently infected cells shown positively contribute to
spontaneous ebv reactivation, showing ebna1 role suppressing
reactivation. second, lytic cycle induced, ebna1 depletion decreased
lytic gene expression dna amplification, showing positively
contributed lytic infection. since previously shown ebna1
disrupts promyelocytic leukemia (pml) nuclear bodies, investigated whether
this function could account effects ebna1 lytic infection by
repeating experiments cells lacking pml proteins. absence pml,
ebna1 promote lytic infection, indicating ebna1-mediated pml
disruption responsible promoting lytic infection. keeping this
conclusion, pml silencing found sufficient induce ebv lytic
cycle. finally, generating cells single pml isoforms, showed that
individual pml isoforms sufficient suppress ebv lytic reactivation,
although pml isoform iv (pml iv) ineffective efficiently 
degraded ebna1. results provide first function ebna1 lytic
infection show ebna1 interactions pml iv lead loss pml
nuclear bodies (nbs) promotes lytic infection.
