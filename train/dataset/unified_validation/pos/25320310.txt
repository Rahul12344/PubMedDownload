influenza viruses (iavs) rely host factors support life cycle, as
viral proteins hijack interact cellular proteins execute their
functions. identification understanding factors would increase our
knowledge molecular mechanisms manipulated viruses. study, 
we searched novel binding partners influenza virus ns2 protein, 
nuclear export protein responsible overcoming host range restriction, a
yeast two-hybrid screening assay glutathione s-transferase-pulldown and
coimmunoprecipitation assays identified aimp2, potent tumor suppressor that
usually functions regulate protein stability, one major ns2-binding 
candidates. found presence ns2 protected aimp2 from
ubiquitin-mediated degradation ns2-transfected cells aimp2 functioned a
positive regulator iav replication. interestingly, aimp2 significant
effect ns2 enhanced stability matrix protein m1. further, we
provide evidence aimp2 recruitment switches modification m1 from
ubiquitination sumoylation, occurs attachment site (k242) on
m1 thereby promotes m1-mediated viral ribonucleoprotein complex nuclear
export increase viral replication. collectively, results reveal new
mechanism aimp2 mediation influenza virus replication.importance: although 
the ubiquitination m1 iav infection observed, precise
modification site molecular consequences modification remain
obscure. here, demonstrate first time ubiquitin sumo compete 
for lysine (k242) m1 interaction ns2 aimp2
facilitates switch m1 modification ubiquitination sumoylation,
thus increasing viral replication.
