double-stranded rna (dsrna), frequent byproduct virus infection, is
recognized toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) mediate innate immune response to
virus infection. tlr3 signaling activates transcription factor irf-3 its
ser/thr phosphorylation, accompanied dimerization nuclear
translocation. reported ser/thr kinase tbk-1 essential
for tlr3-mediated activation phosphorylation irf-3. report that
dsrna-activated phosphorylation two specific tyrosine residues tlr3 is
essential initiating two distinct signaling pathways. one involves activation
of tbk-1 recruits activates pi3 kinase downstream
kinase, akt, leading full phosphorylation activation irf-3. pi3
kinase recruited tlr3 activity blocked, irf-3 only
partially phosphorylated fails bind promoter target gene in
dsrna-treated cells. thus, pi3k-akt pathway plays essential role in
tlr3-mediated gene induction.
