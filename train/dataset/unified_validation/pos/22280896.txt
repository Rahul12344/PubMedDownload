picornavirus infection lead disruption nuclear pore traffic, shut-off
of cell translation machinery, cleavage proteins involved cellular
signal transduction innate response infection. here, demonstrated
that fmdv 3c(pro) induced cleavage nuclear rna-binding protein sam68
c-terminus containing nuclear localization sequence (nls). consequently, it
stimulated redistribution sam68 cytoplasm. sirna knockdown of
sam68 resulted 1000-fold reduction viral titers, prompted us to
study effect sam68 fmdv post-entry events. interestingly, sam68
interacts internal ribosomal entry site within 5' non-translated
region fmdv genome, sam68 knockdown decreased fmdv ires-driven
activity vitro suggesting could modulate translation viral
genome. results uncover novel role sam68 context of
picornaviruses proteolysis new cellular target fmdv 3c(pro).
