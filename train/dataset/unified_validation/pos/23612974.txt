a critical step influenza virus replication cycle cleavage
activation ha precursor. cleavage activation influenza ha enables
fusion host endosome, allowing release viral genome 
host cell. date, studies determined ha activation driven by
trypsin-like host cell proteases, well yet identified bacterial
proteases. although number host proteases activate ha growing,
there still uncertainty regarding secreted proteases able support
multicycle replication influenza. study, determined the
kallikrein-related peptidases 5 12 secreted human respiratory
tract ability cleave activate ha h1, h2, h3
subtypes. peptidase appears preference particular influenza
subtypes, kallikrein 5 cleaving h1 h3 subtypes efficiently 
kallikrein 12 cleaving h1 h2 subtypes efficiently. cleavage analysis
using ha cleavage site peptide mimics revealed amino acids neighboring
the arginine cleavage site affect cleavage efficiency. additionally, the
thrombolytic zymogens plasminogen, urokinase, plasma kallikrein been
shown cleave activate influenza found circulating mainly as
inactive precursors. kallikrein 5 kallikrein 12 examined their
ability activate thrombolytic zymogens, resulted activation of
each zymogen, kallikrein 12 potent activator. activation the
thrombolytic zymogens may therefore allow direct indirect activation
of ha human-adapted influenza viruses kallikrein 5 kallikrein 12.
