the covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) hepatitis b virus (hbv) plays 
an essential role chronic hepatitis. cellular repair system proposed to
convert cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (nc) dna (partially double-stranded dna) into
cccdna nucleus. recently, antiviral cytidine deaminases, aid/apobec
proteins, shown generate uracil residues nc-dna through
deamination, resulting cytidine-to-uracil (c-to-u) hypermutation viral 
genome. investigated whether uracil residues hepadnavirus dna excised 
by uracil-dna glycosylase (ung), host factor base excision repair (ber).
when ung activity inhibited expression ung inhibitory protein
(ugi), hypermutation nc-dna induced either apobec3g interferon treatment
was enhanced human hepatocyte cell line. assess effect ung 
cccdna viral intermediate, used duck hbv (dhbv) replication model.
sequence analyses dhbv dnas showed cccdna accumulated g-to-a c-to-t
mutations apobec3g-expressing cells, extensively enhanced ung 
inhibition. cccdna hypermutation generated many premature stop codons 
p gene. ung inhibition also enhanced apobec3g-mediated suppression viral
replication, including reduction nc-dna, pre-c mrna, secreted viral
particle-associated dna prolonged culture. enhancement apobec3g-mediated
suppression ung inhibition observed catalytic site of
apobec3g mutated. transfection experiments recloned cccdnas revealed 
the combination ung inhibition apobec3g expression reduced replication
ability cccdna. taken together, data indicate ung excises uracil
residues viral genome cccdna formation nucleus
and imply ber pathway activities decrease antiviral effect of
apobec3-mediated hypermutation.
