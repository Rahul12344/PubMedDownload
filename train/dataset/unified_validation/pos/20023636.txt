human cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) lymphotropic retrovirus whose
cell-to-cell transmission requires cell contacts. htlv-1-infected lymphocytes
form 'virological synapses', mechanism htlv-1 transmission remains
poorly understood. show htlv-1-infected lymphocytes transiently
store viral particles carbohydrate-rich extracellular assemblies held
together attached cell surface virally-induced extracellular matrix
components, including collagen agrin, cellular linker proteins, as
tetherin galectin-3. extracellular viral assemblies rapidly adhere other
cells upon cell contact, allowing virus spread infection target cells.
their removal strongly reduces ability htlv-1-producing cells infect
target cells. findings unveil novel virus transmission mechanism based on
the generation extracellular viral particle assemblies whose structure,
composition function resemble bacterial biofilms. htlv-1
biofilm-like structures represent major route virus transmission cell 
to cell.
