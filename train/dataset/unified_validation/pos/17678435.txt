human papillomaviruses (hpvs), associated majority cervical
cancers, encode transforming protein, e6, interacts p53 tumor
suppressor protein. wide effort focused searching target of
the involvement p53-independent hpv 16 e6-interacting proteins. identified 
breast cancer 1 gene (brca1)-associated ring domain protein 1 (bard1) a
binding partner e6 investigated biological function cervical cancer
cells. vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay performed determine whether
e6-bard1 interaction occurred. used degradation assay determine
whether e6-mediated inactivation bard1 transactivation function associated
with bard1 degradation. mutation assay revealed site interaction e6
with bard1. effect bard1 p53 transcriptional activity tested using 
bard1 knockdown overexpression systems. bard1 degraded e6, and,
instead, formed physical complex e6. moreover, mutations metal 
motif zinc-finger region decreased ability e6 interact bard1.
transient transfection bard1 increased p53-mediated activation of
p21(waf1) promoter despite presence e6. additionally, existence of
bard1 inactivated expression e6 cervical cancer cells. findings
suggest bard1 may regulate transcriptional activities p53 tumor
suppressors.
