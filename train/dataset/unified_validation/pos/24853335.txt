pathogens interfere vital biological processes host by
mimicking host proteins. ns1 protein influenza h3n2 subtype
possesses histone h3k4-like sequence carboxyl terminus been
reported use mimic hijack host proteins. however, mimic lacks a
free n-terminus essential binding many known h3k4 readers. we
show double chromodomains chd1 adopt 'open pocket' interact
with free n-terminal amine h3k4, open pocket permits ns1 mimic
to bind distinct conformation. also explored possibility ns1
hijacks cellular proteins found ns1 mimic access a
subset chromatin-associated factors, wdr5. moreover, methylation of
the ns1 mimic reversed h3k4 demethylase lsd1. overall, thus 
conclude ns1 mimic imperfect histone mimic.
