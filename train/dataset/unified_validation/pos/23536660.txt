phosphorylation viral proteins plays important roles influenza virus 
(iav) life cycle. using mass spectrometry, identified tyrosine 132 (y132)
as phosphorylation site matrix protein (m1) influenza virus
a/wsn/1933(h1n1). phosphorylation site essential process of
virus replication controlling nuclear import m1. further
demonstrated phosphorylated tyrosine crucial binding m1 to
the nuclear import factor importin-α1, since substitutions site
severely reduce protein-protein interaction damage the
importin-α1-mediated nuclear import m1. additionally, tyrosine
phosphorylation leads nuclear import m1 blocked janus
kinase inhibitor. present study reveals pivotal role tyrosine
phosphorylation intracellular transportation m1, controls the
process viral replication.
