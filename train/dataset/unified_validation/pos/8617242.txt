the e7 gene product human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv16) binds the
retinoblastoma gene product (prb) dissociates prb-e2f complexes. however, the
observation ability e7 bind prb required the
hpv16-induced immortalization primary keratinocytes prompted search for
other cellular factors bound e7. using glutathione-s-transferase (gst)
fusion protein system, show e7 complexes ap1 transcription factors
including c-jun, junb, jund c-fos. ability e7 complex c-jun in
vivo demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation yeast two-hybrid system.
an analysis e7 point mutants gst system indicates e7
zinc-finger motif, prb binding domain, involved these
interactions. using c-jun deletion mutants, e7 binding maps amino acids
224 286 c-jun. e7 trans-activates c-jun-induced transcription jun
responsive promoter, activity correlates ability e7 mutants 
to bind jun proteins. finally, transcriptionally inactive c-jun deletion, which
can bind e7, interferes e7-induced transformation rat embryo
fibroblasts cooperation activated ras, indicating jun-e7
interaction physiologically relevant jun factors may targeted in
the e7 transformation pathway.
