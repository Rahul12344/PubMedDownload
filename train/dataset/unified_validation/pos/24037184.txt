in eukaryotes, least 60 members dexd/h helicase family, many 
of able sense viral nucleic acids. screening known family
members, identified helicase dhx33 novel double-stranded rna (dsrna) 
sensor myeloid dendritic cells (mdcs). knockdown dhx33 using small
heteroduplex rna (shrna) blocked ability mdcs produce type interferon
(ifn) response poly i:c reovirus. helicc domain dhx33 shown 
to bind poly i:c. interaction dhx33 ips-1 mediated the
helicc region dhx33 c-terminal domain ips-1 (also referred mavs 
and visa). inhibition dhx33 expression rna interference blocked the
poly i:c-induced activation map kinases, nf-Îºb irf3. interaction
between helicase dhx33 ips-1 independent rig-i/mda5 may a
novel pathway sensing poly i:c rna viruses mdcs.
