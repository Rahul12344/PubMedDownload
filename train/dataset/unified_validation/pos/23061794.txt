epstein-barr virus (ebv), like many persistent herpes viruses, acquired
numerous mechanisms subverting evading immune surveillance. study
investigates role secreted ebv-encoded barf1 protein (sbarf1) creating 
an immune evasive microenvironment. wild-type consensus barf1 expressed in
the human 293 cell line purified. native hexameric sbarf1 inhibitory
capacity macrophage colony stimulating factor (m-csf)-stimulated, on
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (gm-csf)-stimulated growth and
differentiation myeloid cells. antibodies specific hexameric sbarf1 were
able block effect. m-csf shown interact sbarf1 via the
protruding n-terminal loops involving val38 ala84. barf1 hexamer was
capable binding three m-csf dimers. mutations barf1 loops greatly
affected m-csf interaction, showed loss growth inhibition. analysis the
activation state m-csf receptor c-fms downstream kinase pathways
showed sbarf1 prevented m-csf-induced downstream phosphorylation. since
m-csf important factor macrophage differentiation, effect sbarf1 
on function monocyte-derived macrophages evaluated. sbarf1 affected
overall survival morphology significantly reduced expression of
macrophage differentiation surface markers cd14, cd11b, cd16, cd169. 
macrophages differentiating presence sbarf1 showed impaired responses
to lipopolysaccharide decreased oxygen radical formation well reduced
phagocytosis apoptotic cells. conclusion, ebv sbarf1 protein potent
decoy receptor m-csf, hampering function differentiation of
macrophages. results suggest sbarf1 contributes modulation of
immune responses microenvironment ebv-positive carcinomas.
