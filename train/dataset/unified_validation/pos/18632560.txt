nipah virus (niv) hendra virus type species highly pathogenic 
paramyxovirus genus henipavirus, cause severe respiratory disease and
fatal encephalitis infections humans, case fatality rates approaching
75%. niv contains two envelope glycoproteins, receptor-binding g glycoprotein
(niv-g) facilitates attachment host cells fusion (f) glycoprotein
that mediates membrane merger. henipavirus g glycoproteins lack both
hemagglutinating neuraminidase activities and, instead, engage highly
conserved ephrin-b2 ephrin-b3 cell surface proteins entry receptors.
here, report crystal structures niv-g receptor-unbound 
state complex ephrin-b3, providing, knowledge, first view 
of paramyxovirus attachment complex cellular protein used 
virus receptor. complex formation generates extensive protein-protein
interface around protruding ephrin loop, inserted central
cavity niv-g beta-propeller. analysis structural data reveals the
molecular basis highly specific interactions henipavirus g
glycoproteins two members (ephrin-b2 ephrin-b3) large
ephrin family suggests mediate unique fashion cell
attachment initiation membrane fusion virus infection
processes. structures suggest niv-g/ephrin interactions 
be effectively targeted disrupt viral entry provide foundation for
structure-based antiviral drug design.
