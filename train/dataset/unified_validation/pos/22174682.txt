autophagy conserved degradative pathway used host defense mechanism
against intracellular pathogens. however, several viruses evade subvert
autophagy insure replication. nevertheless, molecular details of
viral interaction autophagy remain largely unknown. determined the
ability 83 proteins several families rna viruses (paramyxoviridae,
flaviviridae, orthomyxoviridae, retroviridae togaviridae), interact with
44 human autophagy-associated proteins using yeast two-hybrid bioinformatic
analysis. found autophagy network highly targeted rna viruses. 
although central autophagy, targeted proteins also high number of
connections proteins cellular functions. interestingly,
immunity-associated gtpase family (irgm), targeted protein, found 
to interact autophagy-associated proteins atg5, atg10, map1cl3c and
sh3glb1. strikingly, reduction irgm expression using small interfering rna
impairs measles virus (mev), hepatitis c virus (hcv) human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1)-induced autophagy viral particle production.
moreover found expression irgm-interacting mev-c, hcv-ns3 or
hiv-nef proteins per se sufficient induce autophagy, irgm
dependent pathway. work reveals unexpected role irgm virus-induced
autophagy suggests several different families rna viruses may use
common strategies manipulate autophagy improve viral infectivity.
