the hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns3-4a protease essential component of
the viral replication complex prime target antiviral intervention but
also key player persistence pathogenesis hcv. cleaves and
thereby inactivates two crucial adaptor proteins viral rna sensing innate 
immunity, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (mavs) trif, a
phosphatase involved growth factor signaling, t-cell protein tyrosine
phosphatase (tc-ptp), e3 ubiquitin ligase component uv-damaged
dna-binding protein 1 (ddb1). explored quantitative proteomics to
identify novel cellular substrates ns3-4a protease. cell lines inducibly
expressing ns3-4a protease analyzed stable isotopic labeling using
amino acids cell culture (silac) coupled protein separation mass
spectrometry. approach identified membrane-associated peroxidase gpx8 as
a bona fide cellular substrate hcv ns3-4a protease. cleavage ns3-4a
occurs cys 11, removing cytosolic tip gpx8, observed in
different experimental systems well liver biopsies patients with
chronic hcv. overexpression rna silencing studies revealed gpx8 is
involved viral particle production hcv entry rna
replication.conclusion: provide proof-of-concept use quantitative
proteomics identify cellular substrates viral protease describe gpx8 
as novel proviral host factor targeted hcv ns3-4a protease.
