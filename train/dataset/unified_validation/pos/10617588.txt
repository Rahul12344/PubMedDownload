herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) establishes life-long latent infection in
sensory neurons infected individuals. infected cell protein 0 (icp0) is
important productive infection reactivation latency. thus,
activation icp0 expression neurons likely important for
reactivation latency. mouse neuroblastoma cell line, icp0 promoter
activity high compared strong viral promoters. contrast,
promoter activity low non-neuronal cells. dnase footprinting assays
indicated three distinct motifs icp0 promoter bound nuclear
factors. one motifs contains binding site novel helix-loop-helix
olfactory neuron-specific transcription factor (olf-1). gel shift assays and
supershift assays using olf-1-specific antibody demonstrated mouse
neuroblastoma cells express olf-1, bound olf-1-like site the
icp0 promoter. deletion putative olf-1 motif reduced icp0 promoter
activity 5-fold mouse neuroblastoma cells prevented
trans-activation olf-1 expression vector. hypothesize the
olf-1-binding site activates icp0 promoter activity neurons during
reactivation latency.
