the latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) central maintenance of
kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) survival of
kshv-carrying tumor cells. effort identify interaction partners lana,
we purified authentic high-molecular-weight complexes lana conventional
chromatography followed immunoprecipitation bc-3 cell line. is
the first analysis lana-interacting partners based forced
ectopic expression lana. subsequent tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) analysis 
identified many known lana-interacting proteins. confirmed lana's
interactions histones. three classes proteins survived stringent
four-step purification procedure (size, heparin, anion, immunoaffinity
chromatography): two heat shock proteins (hsp70 hsp96 precursor), signal
recognition particle 72 (srp72), 10 different ribosomal proteins. these
proteins likely involved structural interactions within lana
high-molecular-weight complexes. here, show ribosomal protein s6 (rps6)
interacts lana. interaction mediated n-terminal domain of
lana require dna rna. depletion rps6 primary effusion
lymphoma (pel) cells dramatically decreases half-life full-length lana.
the fact rps6 well-established nuclear function beyond role in
ribosome assembly suggests rps6 (and extension ribosomal proteins) 
contributes extraordinary stability lana.
