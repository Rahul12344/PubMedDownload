the hepatitis c virus (hcv) genome contains numerous rna elements are
required replication. identified rna structures located
within 5' 3' untranslated regions (utrs). one prominent rna structure,
termed cis-acting replication element (cre), located within ns5b
coding region. mutation part cre, 5bsl3.2 stem-loop, impairs hcv
rna replication. loop implicated kissing interaction a
complementary stem-loop structure 3' utr. although clear this
interaction required viral replication, function interaction,
and regulation unknown. order gain insight cre function,
we isolated cellular proteins preferentially bind cre identified
them using mass spectrometry. approach identified ewsr1 cre-binding
protein. silencing ewsr1 expression impairs hcv replication infectious virus 
production translation. ewrs1 shuttling protein is
extensively nuclear hepatocytes, substantial amounts ewsr1 localize 
cytosol hcv-infected cells colocalize sites hcv replication. a
subset ewrs1 translocates detergent-resistant membrane fractions, which
contain viral replicase proteins, cells replicating hcv. ewsr1
directly binds cre, dependent intact cre structure.
finally, ewsr1 preferentially interacts cre absence the
kissing interaction. study implicates ewsr1 novel modulator cre
function hcv replication.
