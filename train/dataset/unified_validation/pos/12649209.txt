by means yeast two-hybrid system, discovered novel physical
interaction adenovirus e1a oncoprotein ran, small gtpase 
regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell cycle progression, mitotic
spindle organization. expression e1a elicits induction phase and
centrosome amplification variety rodent cell lines. induction of
supernumerary centrosomes requires functional rcc1, nucleotide exchange
factor ran and, hence, functional ran network. e1a portion responsible 
for interaction ran extreme nh(2)-terminal region (amino acids
1-36), also required induction centrosome amplification. in
an vitro assay recombinant proteins, wild-type e1a interferes with
nucleotide exchange ran, whereas e1a mutant, deleted extreme
nh(2)-terminal region, not. addition, detected vitro interaction
between ran hpv-16 e7 sv40 large antigen, two oncoproteins functionally
related e1a. findings suggest common pathway oncoproteins 
eliciting virus-induced genomic instability.
