latent epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection causes human lymphomas carcinomas. 
ebv usually persists episome malignant cells. ebv episome persistence,
replication, gene expression dependent ebna1 binding multiple
cognate sites orip. search inhibitors ebna1- orip-dependent
episome maintenance transcription, library 40,550 small molecules was
screened compounds inhibit ebna1- orip-dependent transcription and
do inhibit ebna1- orip-independent transcription. screening
identified roscovitine, selective inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase 1
(cdk1), cdk2, cdk5, cdk7. based motif predictions ebna1 serine 393 a
cdk phosphorylation site (486)rall(489) (580)kdlvm(584) potential
cyclin binding domains, hypothesized cyclin binding ebna1 may enable
cdk1, -2, -5, -7 phosphorylate serine 393. found escherichia
coli-expressed ebna1 amino acids 387 641 phosphorylated vitro by
cdk1-, -2-, -5-, -7/cyclin complexes serine 393 phosphorylation was
roscovitine inhibited. further, s393a mutation abrogated phosphorylation. s393a
mutant ebna1 deficient supporting ebna1- orip-dependent transcription 
and episome persistence, roscovitine little effect the
diminished s393a mutant ebna1-mediated transcription episome persistence.
immunoprecipitated flag-ebna1 phosphorylated vitro, roscovitine
inhibited phosphorylation. moreover, roscovitine decreased nuclear ebna1 and
often increased cytoplasmic ebna1, whereas s393a mutant ebna1 localized
equally nucleus cytoplasm unaffected roscovitine treatment.
these data indicate roscovitine effects serine 393 specific that
serine 393 important ebna1- oripcp-dependent transcription episome 
persistence.
