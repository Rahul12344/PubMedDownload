encephalomyocarditis virus (emcv), cardiovirus, initiates polyprotein 
a short 67 amino acid leader (l) sequence. protein acts unique
pathogenicity factor, anti-host activities include triggering of
nuclear pore complex hyperphosphorylation direct binding inhibition the
active cellular transport protein, ran gtpase. chemical modifications protein
mutagenesis map ran binding domain l hinge-linker region, in
particular, amino acids 35-40. large deletions affecting region were
shown previously diminish ran binding. new point mutations, especially k35q,
d37a w40a, preserve intact l structure, abolish ran binding are
deficient nucleoporin (nup) hyperphosphorylation. ran morphs through
multiple configurations, reacts effectively l gdp
format, preferably empty nucleotide binding pocket. therefore, l:ran
binding, mediated linker-hinge, required step l-induced nuclear
transport inhibition.
