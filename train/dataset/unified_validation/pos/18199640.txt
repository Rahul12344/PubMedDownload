herpesvirus lytic dna replication requires cis-acting element, the
origin, trans-acting factors, including virally encoded origin-binding
protein, dna replication enzymes, auxiliary factors. two lytic dna
replication origins (ori-lyt) kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv)
have identified, two virally encoded proteins, namely, rta k8, 
been shown bind origins. study, sought identify cellular 
factors associate ori-lyt using dna affinity purification mass
spectrometry. approach led identification several cellular proteins
that bind kshv ori-lyt. include topoisomerases (topo) ii, msh2/6,
recql, poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp-1), dna-pk, ku86/70 autoantigens, 
scaffold attachment factor (saf-a). recql appears associate with
prereplication complexes recruited ori-lyt rta k8.
topoisomerases, msh2, parp-1, dna-pk, ku86 detected in
prereplication complexes present replication initiation complexes 
ori-lyt. cellular proteins accumulate viral replication compartments
in nucleus, indicating proteins may role viral
replication. topo ii appear essential viral dna replication as
inhibition activities specific inhibitors (camptothecin and
ellipticine) blocked ori-lyt-dependent dna replication. furthermore, inhibition
of parp-1 chemical inhibitors (3-aminobenzamide niacinamide) resulted in
decreased ori-lyt-dependent dna replication, whereas hydroxyurea, raises
parp-1 activity, caused increase dna replication, suggesting positive
role parp-1 kshv lytic dna replication.
