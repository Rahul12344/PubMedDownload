among hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis c virus (hcv) considered the
leading cause liver disease humans, affecting approximately 2% world
population. hcv-encoded nonstructural protein 5a (ns5a) 56-58-kda
phosphoprotein, produced processing viral polyprotein. the
potential mechanism(s) ns5a able influence key cellular processes 
are largely unknown. study, investigated functional properties 
ns5a. vivo co-immunoprecipitation pull-down assays demonstrated ns5a 
forms heteromeric complex tata box binding protein (tbp) tumor
suppressor protein p53. mutants tbp p53 showed reduced binding ns5a. to
determine functional relevance associations, found ns5a
inhibits binding p53 tbp dna consensus binding sequences
in vitro. ns5a also inhibited p53-tbp p53-excision repair cross
complementing factor 3 (ercc3) protein-protein complex formation. furthermore,
ns5a repressed p53 regulated p21 (waf1) promoter synthetic promoter
containing multiple p53 responsive dna elements binding sites hct116 p53(+/+) 
cell line. p53-mediated transcriptional activation promoters was
reduced approximately 3-5-fold following expression ns5a. taken together,
these results suggest ns5a may exert influence key cellular processes
by functional associations p53 tbp. could explain one the
possible mechanism(s) ns5a able exert effect cellular gene 
expression cell growth regulation.
