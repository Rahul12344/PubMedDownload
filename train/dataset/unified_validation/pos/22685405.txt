viral replication efficiency large part governed ability viruses 
to counteract pro-apoptotic signals induced infection host cells. for
hhv-8, viral interferon regulatory factor-1 (virf-1) contributes process 
in part via inhibitory interactions bh3-only protein (bop) bim, recently
identified interaction partner virf-1. recognize the
bim-binding domain (bbd) virf-1 resembles region (bh3-b) bid, another
bop, interacts intramolecularly functional bh3 domain bid to
inhibit pro-apoptotic activity. indeed, virf-1 found target bid in
addition bim interact, via bbd region, bh3 domain each.
in functional assays, bbd could substitute bh3-b context bid, to
suppress bid-induced apoptosis bh3-binding-dependent manner, virf-1 
able protect transfected cells apoptosis induced bid. virf-1 can
mediate nuclear sequestration bim, case bid, and
inhibition bid bim virf-1 could occur independently nuclear
localization viral protein. consistent finding, direct
bbd-dependent inactivation virf-1 bid-induced mitochondrial
permeabilization demonstrable vitro isolated bbd sequences also
active assay. addition bim bid bh3 domains, bh3s bops bik,
bmf, hrk, noxa also found bind bbd, pro- and
anti-apoptotic multi-bh domain bcl-2 proteins not. finally, significance
of bid virus replication demonstrated via bid-depletion hhv-8 infected 
cells, enhanced virus production. together, data demonstrate and
characterize bh3 targeting associated inhibition bop pro-apoptotic
activity virf-1 via bid bh3-b mimicry, identifying novel mechanism viral 
evasion host cell defenses.
