we recently identified np9 novel nuclear protein produced human 
endogenous retrovirus k able document exclusive presence np9
transcript tumors transformed cells. aim studying whether np9 
has role tumorigenesis, systematic search interacting proteins was
performed. here, identify ring-type e3 ubiquitin ligase lnx (ligand of
numb protein x) np9-interacting partner. furthermore show the
interaction involves n- c-terminal domains proteins affect
the subcellular localization lnx. lnx reported target cell
fate determinant notch antagonist numb proteasome-dependent degradation, 
thereby causing increase transactivational activity notch. document
that lnx-interacting np9, like numb, unstable degraded via proteasome 
pathway ectopic numb stabilize recombinant np9. combined, these
findings point possibility np9 affects tumorigenesis the
lnx/numb/notch pathway.
