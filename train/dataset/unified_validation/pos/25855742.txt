multiple host molecules known involved cellular entry of
filoviruses, including ebola virus (ebov); t-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain
1 (tim-1) niemann-pick c1 (npc1) identified attachment and
fusion receptors, respectively. however, molecular mechanisms underlying 
entry process fully understood. found tim-1 npc1
colocalized interacted intracellular vesicles ebov glycoprotein 
(gp)-mediated membrane fusion occurred. interestingly, tim-1-specific
monoclonal antibody (mab), m224/1, prevented gp-mediated membrane fusion also
interfered binding tim-1 npc1, suggesting interaction
between tim-1 npc1 important filovirus membrane fusion. moreover, mab 
m224/1 efficiently inhibited cellular entry viruses known
filovirus species. data suggest novel mechanism underlying filovirus
membrane fusion provide potential cellular target antiviral compounds
that universally used filovirus infections.importance:
filoviruses, including ebola marburg viruses, cause rapidly fatal diseases in
humans nonhuman primates. currently approved vaccines or
therapeutics filovirus diseases. general, cellular entry step of
viruses one key mechanisms develop antiviral strategies. however,
the molecular mechanisms underlying entry process filoviruses not
been fully understood. study, demonstrate tim-1 npc1, which
serve attachment fusion receptors filovirus entry, interact the
intracellular vesicles ebola virus gp-mediated membrane fusion occurs and
that interaction important filovirus infection. found that
filovirus infection gp-mediated membrane fusion cultured cells were
remarkably suppressed treatment tim-1-specific monoclonal antibody that
interfered interaction tim-1 npc1. data provide new
insights development antiviral compounds universally used 
against filovirus infections.
