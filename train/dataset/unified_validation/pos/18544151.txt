reverse transcription genetic material human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) critical step replication cycle virus. this
process, catalyzed reverse transcriptase (rt), well characterized the
biochemical level. however, infected cells, reverse transcription occurs 
multiprotein complex - reverse transcription complex (rtc) - consisting of
viral genomic rna associated viral proteins (including rt) and, presumably, 
as yet uncharacterized cellular proteins. little known cellular
proteins interacting rtc, reverse transcriptase particular. 
we report hiv-1 reverse transcription affected levels a
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein - rna-binding protein hur. direct
protein-protein interaction rt hur observed yeast two-hybrid
screen confirmed vitro homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (htrf). we
mapped domain interacting hur rnase h domain rt, the
binding domain rt c-terminus hur, partially overlapping third
rrm rna-binding domain hur. hur silencing specific sirnas greatly
impaired early late steps reverse transcription, significantly inhibiting 
hiv-1 infection. moreover, mutagenesis immunoprecipitation studies, we
could detect binding hur viral rna. results suggest 
hur may involved may modulate reverse transcription reaction of
hiv-1, yet unknown mechanism involving protein-protein interaction
with hiv-1 rt.
