autonomously replicating dna viruses must evade mitotic checkpoints actively 
partition genomes maintain persistent infection. e2 protein serves
these functions tethering papillomavirus episomes mitotic chromosomes;
however, mechanism remains unresolved. show e2 binds chlr1, dna
helicase plays role sister chromatid cohesion. e2 mutation w130r
fails bind chlr1 correspondingly associate mitotic
chromosomes. viral genomes encoding e2 mutation episomally
maintained cell culture. notably, e2 w130r binds brd4, reportedly acts
as mitotic tether, indicating interaction insufficient e2
association mitotic chromosomes. rnai-induced depletion chlr1
significantly reduced e2 localization mitotic chromosomes. studies
provide compelling evidence chlr1 association required loading the
papillomavirus e2 protein onto mitotic chromosomes represents a
kinetochore-independent mechanism viral genome maintenance segregation.
