background: upon hiv entry target cells, viral cores released and
rearranged reverse transcription complexes (rtcs), support reverse
transcription also protect transport viral cdna site of
integration. rtcs composed viral cellular proteins originate from
both target producer cells, latter entering target cell within the
viral core. however, proteome hiv-1 viral cores context type
of producer cells yet characterized.
results: examined proteomic profiles cores purified hiv-1
nl4-3 virions assembled sup-t1 cells (t lymphocytes), pma vitamin d3
activated thp1 (model macrophages, mmφ), non-activated thp1 cells (model
of monocytes, mmn) assessed potential involvement identified proteins in
the early stages infection using gene ontology information data from
genome-wide screens proteins important hiv-1 replication. identified
202 cellular proteins incorporated viral cores (t cells: 125, mmφ: 110,
mmn: 90) overlap sets limited 42 proteins. groups
of rna binding (29), dna binding (17), cytoskeleton (15), cytoskeleton regulation
(21), chaperone (18), vesicular trafficking-associated (12) and
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-associated proteins (9) numerous. cores of
the virions supt1 cells contained twice many rna binding proteins as
cores thp1-derived virus, whereas cores virions mmφ mmn were
enriched components cytoskeleton vesicular transport machinery, most
probably due differences virion assembly pathways cells.
spectra chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
components similar viral cores different cell types, whereas
dna-binding especially rna-binding proteins highly diverse. western blot
analysis showed within group overlapping proteins, level of
incorporation rna binding (rha helic2) dna binding proteins (mcm5
and ku80) viral cores cells higher cores 
mmφ mmn correlate abundance proteins virus

conclusions: profiles host proteins packaged cores hiv-1 virions
depend type virus producing cell. pool proteins present the
cores virions likely contain factors important viral functions.
