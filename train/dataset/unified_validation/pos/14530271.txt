t-cell leukemia htlv-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.
tax, 40-kda protein, regulates viral cellular transcription, host signal
transduction, cell cycle, apoptosis. tax shown modulate
cellular creb nfkappab pathways; however, date, role binding to
various host cellular proteins involved tumorigenesis fully
described. study, describe tax-associated proteins their
functions cells using several approaches. tax eluted sizing column
mostly apparent molecular mass 1800 kda. following tax
immunoprecipitation, washes high salt buffer, two-dimensional gel
separation, mass spectrometric analysis, total 32 proteins was
identified. many proteins belong signal transduction and
cytoskeleton pathways transcription/chromatin remodeling. these
proteins, including txbp151, shown previously bind tax. the
interaction tax small gtpase-cytoskeleton proteins, ras gap1m,
rac1, cdc42, rhoa, gelsolin, indicates tax may regulate migration,
invasion, adhesion t-cell cancers. finally, physical functional
association tax chromatin remodeling swi/snf complex assessed
using vitro chromatin remodeling assays, chromatin remodeling factor brg1
mutant cells, rna interference experiments. collectively, tax able bind
and regulate many cellular proteins regulate transcription cytoskeletal 
related pathways, might explain pleiotropic effects tax leading to
t-cell transformation leukemia htlv-1-infected patients.
