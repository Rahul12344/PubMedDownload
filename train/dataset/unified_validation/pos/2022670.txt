at least two different types proteins, nf-kappa b/kbf1 and
hiv-ep1/prdii-bf1/mbp-1, members family rel oncoproteins and
metal-finger proteins, respectively, bind human immunodeficiency virus
type (hiv-1) enhancer. new member hiv-ep1 family expressed a
high level cells, isolated cdna clones hiv-ep2 by
cross-hybridization hiv-ep1 cdna. hiv-ep2 protein consists 1,833 amino
acids molecular weight 211,000. hiv-ep2 protein highly homologous
with hiv-ep1/prdii-bf1/mbp-1 three regions. three regions contain the
potential nuclear localization signal followed ser/thr-rich region, the
dna-binding domain consisting metal-finger structure, cluster of
acidic amino acids. dna-binding property hiv-ep2 similar of
hiv-ep1. northern blot analysis hiv-ep2 mrna indicated relatively high
expression cell line molt-4 tumor cell lines. furthermore,
like hiv-ep1, expression hiv-ep2 mrna greatly induced mitogen and
phorbol ester treatment jurkat cells, suggesting hiv-ep2 acts hiv
production latently infected cells.
