using yeast two-hybrid screen t-cell cdna library identify cellular
proteins bind human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (hiv-2) gag
polyprotein, identified prp4, serine-threonine protein kinase. specific
interaction prp4 hiv-2 gag confirmed vitro vivo assays.
the interacting region hiv-2 gag located conserved matrix capsid
domains, rs (arginine-serine-rich) domain ks (kinase)
domain prp4 able bind hiv-2 gag. prp4 incorporated virus
particles. hiv-2 gag able inhibit prp4-mediated phosphorylation the
splicing factor sf2. also observed gag simian immunodeficiency 
virus, closely related virus, gag human t-cell lymphotropic
virus type 1. results provide evidence novel interaction gag
and cellular protein kinase involved control constitutive splicing in
two closely related retroviruses. hypothesize gag accumulates the
cell, regulation splicing occurs reduced phosphorylation sf2. 
at late stages infection, interaction may replace function the
early viral regulatory protein rev.
