when ectopically expressed animal cells, cytokine response modifier (crma), 
a product cowpox virus, prevents programmed cell death initiated a
variety stimuli. since crma proteinase inhibitor, target probably 
a protease promotes cell death. identification target crucial
in delineating essential regulation points modulate apoptotic program.
we compared kinetics interaction crma five proteases may
play role apoptosis. four proteases, members caspase
family, inhibited widely different rates affinities ranging 5
orders magnitude. one inhibited experimental
conditions. crma quite selective ability inhibit caspases, showing
the highest affinity interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme second
highest caspase flice (ki = 0.95 nm), identified component the
intracellular signaling complex recruited ligation death receptor fas. 
on basis comparative inhibitor kinetics, propose crma unlikely 
to inhibit caspases yama, mch2, lap3 vivo inhibition of
flice magnitude protease key target crma during
fas-mediated apoptosis. therefore, results support hypothesis flice 
catalyzes crucial step promotion cell death.
