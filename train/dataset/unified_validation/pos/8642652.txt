the serine/threonine protein kinase raf-1 component conserved
intracellular signaling cascade controls responses various extracellular 
stimuli. transcription several promoters, including oncogene-responsive 
element polyomavirus enhancer, c-fos promoter, well ap-1- 
and ets-dependent promoters, induced raf-1 kinase. previously, 
shown activated raf-1 kinase transactivates human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) long terminal repeat identified nf-kappab binding
motif raf-1-responsive element (rafre). report raf-1
kinase-induced transactivation hiv rafre involves the
purine-rich-repeat-binding protein (gabp), composed two distinct
subunits (alpha beta). gabp alpha ets oncogene-related dna-binding
protein, gabp beta contains four ankyrin-like repeats shown to
be essential protein-protein interactions. electrophoretic mobility shift
assays using nuclear extracts human jurkat cells, protein-dna complex
which supershifted antiserum gabp alpha gabp beta was
observed. purified recombinant gabp alpha beta interact hiv rafre as
judged dna binding assays. cotransfection experiments gabp alpha and
beta raf-1 kinase demonstrate synergistic transactivation hiv-1
promoter. point mutations hiv rafre abolished raf-1 kinase well 
gabp alpha- beta-induced transactivation. observed raf-1-gabp synergism
presumably involves phosphorylation gabp subunits, treatment cells 
raf-1 kinase activators serum 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increases 
phosphorylation gabp vivo. however, gabp target raf-1 kinase;
instead, substrate mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk/erk), since 
in vitro phosphorylation gabp alpha beta achieved reconstituted
protein kinase cascade purified raf-1 mek. results suggest 
that raf-1 kinase- induced activation hiv-1 promoter mediated the
classical cytoplasmic cascade resulting mapk/erk-mediated phosphorylation of
gabp alpha beta. hiv rafre corresponds region within the
promoter essential regulation hiv-1 expression, data indicate
that addition nk-kappab, gabp transcription factors important for
induced expression hiv.
