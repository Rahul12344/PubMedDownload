human papillomavirus replication initiator, e1 helicase, binds weakly 
origin dna replication. purified human chaperone proteins hsp70 hsp40
(hdj-1 hdj-2) independently additively enhanced e1 binding origin.
the interaction e1 hsp70 transient required atp hydrolysis,
whereas hsp40 bound e1 directly remained complex. peptide 20
residues spanning hpd loop helix ii j domain ydj-1 also
stimulated e1 binding origin, alone combination hsp70 hsp40.
a mutated peptide (h34q) reduced activity, adjacent an
overlapping peptide effect. neither hsp70 j peptide altered the
e1/dna ratio complex. electron microscopy showed e1 mainly bound to
dna hexamer. presence hsp40, e1 primarily bound dna a
dihexamer. preincubation chaperones viral e1 template shortened the
lag time increased replication cell-free system. since two helicases are
essential bidirectional replication human papillomavirus dna, these
results demonstrate that, prokaryotes, chaperones play important role in
the assembly preinitiation complexes origin.
