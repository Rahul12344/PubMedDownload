human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) etiological agent adult
t-cell leukemia (atl), viral oncoprotein tax plays key roles the
immortalization human cells, lifelong persistent infection, and
leukemogenesis. herein identify ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (usp10) 
a tax-interactor htlv-1-infected cells. usp10 antistress factor
against various environmental stresses, including viral infections oxidative 
stress. exposure arsenic, oxidative stress inducer, usp10 recruited
into stress granules (sgs), usp10-containing sgs reduce reactive oxygen
species (ros) production inhibit ros-dependent apoptosis. found that
interaction tax usp10 inhibits arsenic-induced sg formation, stimulates
ros production, augments ros-dependent apoptosis htlv-1-infected cells. 
these findings suggest usp10 host factor inhibits stress-induced
ros production apoptosis htlv-1-infected cells; however, activities 
are attenuated tax. clinical study showed combination therapy
containing arsenic effective forms atl. therefore, these
findings may relevant chemotherapy atl.
