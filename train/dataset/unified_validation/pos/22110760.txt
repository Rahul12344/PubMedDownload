the non-structural 1 (ns1) protein avian influenza (ai) viruses important
for pathogenicity. here, identify previously unrecognized tandem pdz-ligand 
(tpl) domain extreme carboxy terminus ns1 proteins subset of
globally circulating ai viruses. using protein arrays identified
several human pdz-cellular ligands novel domain, one ril 
protein, known regulator cellular tyrosine kinase src. found the
ai ns1 proteins bind stimulate human src tyrosine kinase, their
carboxy terminal src homology type 3-binding (shb) domain. physical
interaction ns1 src ability ai viruses modulate the
phosphorylation status src infection, found influenced
by tpl arrangement. results indicate potential novel
host-pathogen interactions mediated tpl shb domains ai ns1 protein.
