in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-coronavirus (cov) appeared a
novel human virus high similarity bat coronaviruses. however, while
sars-cov uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor for
cellular entry, coronavirus isolated bats appears use ace2. we
show signatures recurrent positive selection bat ace2 gene map
almost perfectly known sars-cov interaction surfaces. data indicate that
ace2 utilization preceded emergence sars-cov-like viruses bats.
