adeno-associated virus (aav) codes four related nonstructural rep proteins.
aav replicates assembles nucleus requires coinfection 
helper virus, either adenovirus (ad) herpesvirus, productive infection. 
like complex dna viruses, believed aav interacts or
modifies host cell proteins carry infection cycle. date, relatively
little known host proteins interact viral rep
proteins, known directly involved dna replication, control 
viral cellular transcription, splicing, protein translation. this
study, used affinity-tagged rep protein purify cellular protein complexes
that associated rep cells infected ad aav. in
all, identified 188 cellular proteins 16 functional categories, including
14 transcription factors, 6 translation factors, 15 potential splicing proteins, 
5 proteins involved protein degradation, 13 proteins involved dna
replication repair. dramatically increases number potential
interactions current number approximately 26. twelve novel
proteins found tested coimmunoprecipitation colocalization
using confocal immunomicroscopy. these, 10 confirmed proteins that
formed complexes rep, including proteins mcm complex (dna
replication), rcn1 (membrane transport), smc2 (chromatin dynamics), edd1
(ubiquitin ligase), irs4 (signal transduction), fus (splicing). computer
analysis suggested 45 28 188 proteins could placed a
pathway interacting proteins involved dna replication protein
synthesis, respectively. proteins involved dna replication, 
previously identified proteins involved aav dna replication found, except
ad dbp. ad protein found interact rep e1b55k protein. in
addition, confirmed rep interacts ku70/80 helicase. vitro dna
synthesis assays demonstrated although ku helicase activity could substitute
for mcm promote strand displacement synthesis, presence essential.
our study suggests interaction aav cellular proteins much
more complex previously suspected provides resource further
studies aav life cycle.
