double-stranded-rna (dsrna)-dependent protein kinase pkr induced interferon
and activated upon autophosphorylation. previously identified four
autophosphorylated amino acids elucidated participation pkr
activation. three sites central region protein, and
one kinase domain. describe identification four
additional autophosphorylated amino acids spacer region separates the
two dsrna-binding motifs rna-binding domain. eight amino acids, including 
these autophosphorylation sites, duplicated hepatitis c virus (hcv)
envelope protein e2. region e2 required inhibition pkr
although mechanism inhibition known. replacement four of
these residues pkr alanines dramatically affect kinase activity
in vitro yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. however, coupled with
mutations serine 242 threonines 255 258 central region, these
mutations increased pkr protein expression mammalian cells, consistent with
diminished kinase activity. synthetic peptide corresponding region of
pkr phosphorylated vitro pkr, phosphorylation strongly
inhibited pkr preincubated hcv e2. another synthetic peptide,
corresponding central region pkr containing serine 242, also
phosphorylated active pkr, e2 inhibit peptide efficiently.
neither pkr peptides able disrupt hcv e2-pkr interaction. taken
together, results show pkr autophosphorylated serine 83 and
threonines 88, 89, 90, autophosphorylation may enhance kinase
activation, inhibition pkr hcv e2 solely due to
duplication competition autophosphorylation sites.
