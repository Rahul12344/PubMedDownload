recombinant glycoprotein 120 (rgp120) human immunodeficiency virus type-1
(hiv-1) activates human complement system absence anti-gp120
antibodies. hiv-1 glycoprotein gp120 dissociate viral envelope
either spontaneously binding hiv-1 cd4 molecule. a
consequence, gp120 circulate patient's serum attach surface
of uninfected cd4+ cells. complement activation cell-bound hiv-1
glycoprotein gp120 subsequent opsonization may represent mechanism the
elimination uninfected cd4+ cells reticuloendothelial system, thereby
enhancing progression hiv disease. current study, complement
proteins c4,c3,c5,c9, properdin found bind synthetic peptide
covering positions 233-251 gp120bru sequence incubation normal
human serum. complement activation peptide comparable that
induced aggregated igg, complete rgp120, previously described
complement-activating gp41-peptide 609-623. activation occurred via classical
pathway abrogated presence edta, mg2+/egta, c4-deficient
human serum. peptides partly overlapping sequence 233-251 activated
complement lesser extent. complement-activating capacity gp120
sequence 233-251 restricted hiv-1bru isolate, peptide
from corresponding sequence hiv-1mn strain also capable of
activating complement. additional strong complement-activating site was
identified gp120 sequence 321-360 hiv-1mn strain. data
indicate distinct sites gp120 able activate human serum complement
via classical pathway absence anti-gp120 independent of
glycosylation.
