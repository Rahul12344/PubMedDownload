nef myristoylated protein 27 35 kda conserved primate
lentiviruses. vivo, nef required high viral load full pathological 
effects. vitro, nef least four activities: induction cd4 major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) class downregulation, enhancement viral
infectivity, alteration t-cell activation pathways. previously reported
that nef protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1 interacts a
novel human thioesterase (hte). present study, mutational analysis, 
identified region nef core, extending residues d108 w124,
that involved nef-hte interaction nef-induced cd4
downregulation. region nef located oligomer interface in
close proximity putative cd4 binding site. one mutants carrying a
mutation region, targeted conserved residue d123, also found
to defective two functions nef, mhc class downmodulation and
enhancement viral infectivity. furthermore, mutation residue affected 
the ability nef form dimers, suggesting oligomerization nef may
be critical multiple functions.
