hepatitis c virus (hcv) classical swine fever virus (csfv) messenger rnas
contain related (hcv-like) internal ribosome entry sites (iress) promote
5'-end independent initiation translation, requiring subset the
eukaryotic initiation factors (eifs) needed canonical initiation cellular 
mrnas. initiation hcv-like iress relies specific interaction the
40s subunit, places initiation codon p site, directly
base-pairs eif2-bound initiator methionyl transfer rna form 48s
initiation complex. however, hcv-like iress also specifically interact with
eif3 (refs 2, 5-7, 9-12), role interaction ires-mediated
initiation remained unknown. canonical initiation, eif3 binds the
40s subunit component 43s pre-initiation complex, comparison of
the ribosomal positions eif3 hcv ires revealed overlap, so
that rearrangement would required formation ribosomal complexes
containing components. present cryo-electron microscopy

remarkably, although position interactions csfv ires 40s 
subunit complex similar hcv ires 40s-ires
binary complex, eif3 completely displaced ribosomal position the
43s complex, instead interacts ribosome-binding surface
exclusively apical region domain iii ires. results suggest
a role specific interaction hcv-like iress eif3 preventing
ribosomal association eif3, could serve two purposes: relieving the
competition ires eif3 common binding site 40s
subunit, reducing formation 43s complexes, thereby favouring translation
of viral mrnas.
