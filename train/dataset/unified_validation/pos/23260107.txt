canine distemper virus (cdv) shown use dog nectin-4 receptor gain 
entry epithelial cells. rna dog placenta mdck kidney cells was
isolated cdnas prepared. two splice variants dog nectin-4 were
identified. deletion 25 amino acids found cytoplasmic domain of
dog nectin-4 mdck cells, corresponding splice variant also seen
in murine nectin-4, affect role receptor. dog nectin-4 
and human nectin-4 could function entry factor cdv containing egfp
reporter gene. inhibition dog nectin-4 expression rnai nectin-4
antibodies decreased cdv titers egfp fluorescence. finally, dog nectin-4 also
promotes syncytia formation, could inhibited sirna treatment. these
data confirm dog nectin-4 used cdv gain entry epithelial
cells, facilitate virus spread.
