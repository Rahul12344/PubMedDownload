kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) maintained stable episome 
in latently infected pleural effusion lymphoma (pel) cells. episome maintenance
is conferred binding kshv-encoded lana protein viral
terminal repeats (tr). here, show dna replication kshv tr is
coupled dna recombination mediated part cellular
replication fork protection factors timeless (tim) tipin. show by
two-dimensional (2d) agarose gel electrophoresis replication forks naturally
stall form recombination-like structures tr unperturbed cell
cycle. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays revealed tim tipin
are selectively enriched kshv tr phase lana-dependent
manner. tim depletion inhibited lana-dependent tr dna replication caused 
loss kshv episomes latently infected pel cells. tim depletion resulted in
the aberrant accumulation recombination structures arrested mcm helicase
at tr. tim depletion induce kshv lytic cycle apoptotic cell death.
we propose kshv episome maintenance requires tim-assisted replication fork
protection viral terminal repeats tim-dependent
recombination-like structures form tr promote dna repeat stability and
viral genome maintenance.
