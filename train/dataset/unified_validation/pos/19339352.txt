heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnrnp) a1 involved pre-mrna
splicing nucleus translational regulation cytoplasm. the
cytoplasmic redistribution hnrnp a1 regulated process viral
infection cellular stress. demonstrate hnrnp a1 an
internal ribosome entry site (ires) trans-acting factor binds specifically
to 5' untranslated region (utr) enterovirus 71 (ev71) regulates
ires-dependent translation also binds 5' utr sindbis virus (sv) and
facilitates translation. cytoplasmic relocalization hnrnp a1 in
ev71-infected cells leads enhancement ev71 ires-mediated translation,
and function substituted hnrnp a2, whereas cytoplasmic
relocalization hnrnp a1 following sv infection enhances sv translation,
but function cannot replaced hnrnp a2. study provides first
direct evidence cytoplasmic relocalization hnrnp a1 controls only
the ires-dependent also non-ires-dependent translation initiations rna
viruses.
