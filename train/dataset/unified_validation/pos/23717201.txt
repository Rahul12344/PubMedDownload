persistent infections hepatitis c virus (hcv) may result life-threatening
liver disease, including cirrhosis cancer, impose important burden 
human health. understanding virus capable achieving persistence 
the majority infected thus important goal. although hcv has
evolved multiple mechanisms disrupt block cellular signaling pathways
involved induction interferon (ifn) responses, ifn-stimulated gene
(isg) expression typically prominent hcv-infected liver. here, show 
that toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) expressed within uninfected hepatocytes is
capable sensing infection adjacent cells, initiating local antiviral
response partially restricts hcv replication. demonstrate is
dependent upon expression class scavenger receptor type 1 (msr1). msr1
binds extracellular dsrna, mediating endocytosis transport toward the
endosome engaged tlr3, thereby triggering ifn responses both
infected uninfected cells. rnai-mediated knockdown msr1 expression blocks 
tlr3 sensing hcv infected hepatocyte cultures, leading increased
cellular permissiveness virus infection. exogenous expression myc-msr1
restores tlr3 signaling msr1-depleted cells subsequent induction an
antiviral state. series conserved basic residues within carboxy-terminus
of collagen superfamily domain msr1 required binding transport
of dsrna, likely facilitate acidification-dependent release dsrna the
site tlr3 expression endosome. findings reveal msr1 a
critical component tlr3-mediated pattern recognition receptor response 
exerts antiviral state infected uninfected hepatocytes, thereby
limiting impact hcv proteins disrupt ifn signaling infected cells 
and restricting spread hcv within liver.
