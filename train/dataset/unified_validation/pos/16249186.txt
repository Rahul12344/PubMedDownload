the e7 oncoprotein human papillomavirus (hpv) mediates cell transformation
in part binding human prb tumor suppressor protein e2f
transcription factors, resulting dissociation prb e2f
transcription factors premature cell progression s-phase 
cell cycle. activity mediated lxcxe motif cr3 zinc binding
domain e7 protein. study report x-ray crystal structure 
the cr3 region hpv e7 structure-based mutational analysis investigate
its mode prb e2f binding e2f displacement prb. structure
reveals novel zinc-bound e7-cr3 obligate homodimer contains two surface
patches sequence conservation. mutation residues within patches
reveals one patch required prb binding, whereas required
for e2f binding. also show e7-mediated interactions required 
disrupt prb.e2f complexes. based studies present mechanistic model 
for e7 displaces e2f prb. cr3 region hpv e7 no
detectable homology human proteins, structure-function studies
presented provide avenue developing small molecule compounds that
inhibit hpv-e7-mediated cell transformation.
