positive transcription elongation factor b (p-tefb) complexes, composed of
cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) cyclin t1 t2, engaged many
cellular transcription regulators activate inhibit transcription from
specific promoters. related i-mfa (inhibitor myod family a) hic (human
i-mfa-domain-containing) proteins function myogenic differentiation and
embryonic development participating wnt signaling pathway. report
that i-mfa novel regulator p-tefb. hic i-mfa interact through
their homologous i-mfa domains cyclin t1 t2 two binding sites. one
site regulatory histidine-rich domain interacts cdk9 substrates 
including rna polymerase ii. second site contains lysine arginine-rich 
motif highly conserved two cyclins. site overlaps 
includes previously identified tat/tar recognition motif cyclin t1
required activation human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
transcription. hic i-mfa serve substrates p-tefb. i-mfa
domains also bind activation domain hiv-1 tat inhibit tat- and
p-tefb-dependent transcription hiv-1 promoter. transcriptional
repression cell-type specific operate via tat cyclin t1. genomic
and sequence comparisons indicate i-mf hic genes, well as
flanking genes, diverged duplicated chromosomal region. findings link 
i-mfa hic viral replication, suggest p-tefb modulated the
wnt signaling pathway.
