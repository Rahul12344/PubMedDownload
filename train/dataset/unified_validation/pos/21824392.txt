background: oncoprotein tax, encoded human t-cell leukemia virus type 1
(htlv1), persistently induces nf-κb activation, contributes to
htlv1-mediated t-cell transformation. recent studies suggest signaling
function tax requires ubiquitination, although tax ubiquitination 
is regulated remains unclear.
results: show deubiquitinase cyld physically interacts tax 
and negatively regulates ubiquitination viral protein. function 
of cyld associated inhibition tax-mediated activation ikk although 
not tak1. interestingly, cyld undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in
htlv1-transformed cells, mechanism known inactivate catalytic activity
of cyld. consistently, phospho-mimetic cyld mutant fails inhibit tax
ubiquitination.
conclusion: findings suggest cyld negatively regulates signaling
function tax inhibition tax ubiquitination. conversely, induction
of cyld phosphorylation may serve mechanism htlv1 overrides the
inhibitory function cyld, leading persistent activation nf-κb.
