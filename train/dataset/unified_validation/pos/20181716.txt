the papillomavirus e2 open reading frame encodes full-length e2 protein as
well alternatively spliced product called e8;e2c. e8;e2c best
studied high-risk human papillomaviruses, shown to
regulate viral genome levels and, like full-length e2 protein, repress
transcription viral promoter directs expression viral e6
and e7 oncogenes. repression function e8;e2c dependent the
12-amino-acid n-terminal sequence e8 open reading frame (orf). order 
to understand mechanism e8;e2c mediates transcriptional repression, 
we performed unbiased proteomic analysis identified six
high-confidence candidate interacting proteins (hcips) e8;e2c; top two
are ncor1 tblr1. established interaction e8;e2c ncor1/hdac3 
complex demonstrated interaction requires wild-type e8 open
reading frame. small interfering rna (sirna) knockdown studies demonstrated the
involvement ncor1/hdac3 e8;e2c-dependent repression viral long
control region (lcr) promoter. additional genetic work confirmed the
papillomavirus e2 e8;e2c proteins repress transcription distinct
mechanisms.
