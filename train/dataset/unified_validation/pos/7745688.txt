gene expression human t-cell leukemia virus type (htlv-i) long
terminal repeat (ltr) mediated three cis-acting regulatory elements known
as 21-bp repeats transactivator protein tax. 21-bp repeats be
subdivided three motifs known a, b, c, important for
maximal gene expression response tax. b motif contains nucleotide
sequences known cyclic amp response element (cre) tax-response element
which binds members atf/creb family transcription factors. though
mutations element htlv-i ltr eliminate tax activation, tax will
not activate promoters containing cre sites. study, we
investigated mechanism tax activates gene expression conjunction 
with members atf/creb family. found tax enhanced binding of
one member atf/creb family, creb 1, three htlv-i ltr 21-bp 
repeats another member designated cre-bp1 creb2. tax enhanced the
binding creb1 nonpalindromic cre binding sites found the
htlv-i ltr, tax enhance binding creb1 palindromic cre
binding sites found somatostatin promoter. finding may help
explain failure tax activate promoters containing consensus cre sites. 
these studies extended use mammalian two-hybrid system. tax was
demonstrated interact directly creb1 bzip proteins,
including creb2 jun. site-directed mutagenesis tax creb1
demonstrated amino terminus tax basic leucine
zipper regions creb1 required direct interactions these
proteins vivo vitro. interaction occurred vivo thus
did require presence htlv-i 21-bp repeats, previously
suggested. results define domains required interaction tax 
and creb likely critical activation htlv-i gene expression.
