through protein-protein binding assays, found hcv core protein interacted
with 14-3-3epsilon protein. interestingly, expression hcv core protein
induced apoptosis 293t cells. apoptosis induced core expression is
accompanied translocation bax cytosol mitochondria, disruption of
mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, activation of
caspase-9 caspase-3. furthermore, over-expression 14-3-3epsilon inhibited 
the core-induced apoptosis bax translocation mitochondria. results
indicate hcv core protein induces bax-mediated apoptosis interacting 
with 14-3-3epsilon protein 293t cells. mechanism apoptosis induction
by hcv core, propose interaction hcv core 14-3-3epsilon
causes dissociation bax bax/14-3-3epsilon complex cytosol, and
the free bax protein provokes activation mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
