friend spleen focus forming-virus (f-sffv) induces acute erythroleukemia in
susceptible mice. initiation erythroleukemia due binding the
env-related glycoprotein gp55 encoded f-sffv erythropoietin receptor
(epor). gp55/epor interaction induces prolonged growth factor independent
proliferation factor-dependent cell line. erythropoietin (epo) signaling,
the jak2/stat5 pathway shown activated downstream epor to
transmit signal cells. determine members jak family 
stat transcription factor family involved gp55/epor signaling, examined
tyrosine phosphorylation jaks stats f-sffv-infected erythroid or
erythroleukemic cells. jak1 stat5 constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated
but dna binding activity stat5 induced without epo stimulation 
erythroblastoid cells spleens f-sffv-infected mice erythroleukemia
cell lines derived gp55-transgenic mice. results indicate jak1 is
involved gp55/epor signaling stat5 playing essential role in
the growth erythroid cells.
