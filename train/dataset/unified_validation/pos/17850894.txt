ficolins collagenous lectins bind n-acetylated glycans participate
in innate immune responses, including phagocytosis complement activation.
related collagenous lectins mannan binding lectin (mbl) surfactant
proteins possess antiviral activity, activity been
demonstrated ficolins. studies, used purified porcine plasma
ficolin alpha recombinant ficolin alpha assess ability bind and
neutralize porcine reproductive respiratory virus (prrsv) various assays. 
recombinant ficolin alpha designed c-terminal 6-histidine tag using 
pcdna3.1 expression vector system cho k1 cells. plasma-purified and
recombinant ficolin alpha reduced cytopathic effect prrsv-infected marc-145
cells neutralization assays inhibited replication infectious viral
particles glcnac-dependent manner. vitro replication determined plaque
assay inhibited presence plasma-purified ficolin alpha and
recombinant ficolin. immunoreactive plasma ficolin alpha recombinant ficolin 
alpha also bound prrsv-coated wells glcnac-dependent manner. studies
indicate porcine ficolin bind neutralize common arterivirus that
is major pathogen swine.
