hepatitis c virus (hcv) positive-strand rna virus responsible chronic
liver disease hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). racgtpase-activating protein 1 
(racgap1) plays important role gtp hydrolysis gdp rac1 cdc42 
protein demonstrated upregulated several cancers, including
hcc. however, molecular mechanism leading upregulation racgap1
remains poorly understood. here, showed racgap1 levels enhanced in
hcv cell-culture-derived (hcvcc) infection. importantly, illustrated that
racgap1 interacts viral protein ns5b mammalian cells. small
interfering rna (sirna)-mediated knockdown racgap1 human hepatoma cell
lines inhibited replication hcv rna, protein, production infectious
particles hcv genotype 2a strain jfh1. conversely, reversed 
expression sirna-resistant racgap1 recombinant protein. addition, viral
protein ns5b polymerase activity significantly reduced silencing racgap1
and, vice versa, increased overexpression racgap1 cell-based
reporter assay. results suggest racgap1 plays crucial role hcv
replication affecting viral protein ns5b polymerase activity holds
importance antiviral drug development.
