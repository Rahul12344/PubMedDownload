the critical immortalizing activity human papillomavirus (hpv) type-16 e6 
oncoprotein induce expression htert, catalytic rate-limiting
subunit telomerase. additionally, e6 binds cellular protein called
e6-associated protein (e6-ap) form e3 ubiquitin ligase targets p53 for
proteasome-dependent degradation. although telomerase induction p53
degradation separable distinct functions e6, binding e6 e6-ap
strongly correlated induction htert. here, demonstrate using
shrnas reduce e6-ap expression e6-ap required e6-mediated
telomerase induction. yeast two-hybrid screen find new targets the
e6/e6-ap e3 ubiquitin ligase complex identified nfx1. two isoforms nfx1 were
found: nfx1-123, coactivated c-myc htert promoter, nfx1-91,
which repressed htert promoter. nfx1-91 highly ubiquitinated and
destabilized epithelial cells expressing e6. furthermore, knockdown nfx1-91
by shrna resulted derepression endogenous htert promoter elevated
levels telomerase activity. propose induction telomerase the
hpv-16 e6/e6-ap complex involves targeting nfx1-91, newly identified
repressor telomerase, ubiquitination degradation.
