when human adenovirus infects human cells disruption rrna biogenesis.
this report examines effect adenovirus infection nucleolar protein,
upstream binding factor (ubf) plays major role regulating rrna
synthesis. determined early infection, ubf associates the
replication viral dna, preferentially associating ends linear 
viral genome, addition anti-ubf serum vitro replication assays 
markedly reduced viral dna replication. regions ubf important these
observations also established. interestingly, sequestering majority of
ubf nucleolus lead ablation rrna synthesis the
sequestration rna pol i. infected cells bulk rna synthesis rna
pol associated distinct location detectable ubf. we
propose ubf plays role viral dna replication, strengthening the
role nucleolar antigens adenovirus life cycle.
