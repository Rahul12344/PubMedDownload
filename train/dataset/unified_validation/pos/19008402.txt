various g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) potential work as
co-receptors human simian immunodeficiency virus (hiv/siv). hiv/siv
co-receptors several tyrosines extracellular n-terminal region
(ntr) common feature. however, domain structure ntr is
critical gpcrs co-receptor activity identified.
comparative studies different hiv/siv co-receptors effective way to
clarify domain. studies carried major
co-receptors, ccr5 cxcr4. chemokine receptor, d6, shown mediate
infection astrocytes hiv-1. recently, also found orphan
gpcr, gpr1, formyl peptide receptor, fprl1, work potent hiv/siv
co-receptors addition ccr5 cxcr4. elucidate domain of
the ntr critical hiv/siv co-receptor activity, study analysed the
effects mutations ntr co-receptor activity d6, fprl1 gpr1
in addition ccr5. results identified number tyrosines are
indispensable activity co-receptors. number positions of
those tyrosines varied among co-receptors among hiv-1 strains. moreover, it
was found small domain amino acids containing tyrosine is
critical co-receptor activity gpr1. findings useful in
elucidating mechanism allows gpcrs potential act as
hiv/siv co-receptors.
