interferon-induced proteins (ifps) exert multiple functions corresponding to
diverse interferon signals. however, intracellular functions many ifps are
not fully characterized. here, report ifp35, member ifp family
with molecular mass 35 kda, interact bovine tas (btas)
regulatory protein bovine foamy virus (bfv). interaction involves nid2
(ifp35/nmi homology domain) ifp35 central domain btas. the
overexpression ifp35 disturbs ability btas activate viral-gene
transcription inhibits viral replication. depletion endogenous ifp35
by interfering rna promote activation bfv, suggesting inhibitory
function ifp35 viral-gene expression. addition, ifp35 interact 
the homologous regulatory protein prototype fv arrest viral replication
and repress viral transcription. study suggests ifp35 may represent a
novel pathway interferon-mediated antiviral activity host organisms that
plays role maintenance fv latency.
