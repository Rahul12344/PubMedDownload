herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection requires binding viral envelope
glycoprotein (gd) cell surface receptors. report x-ray structures 
a soluble, truncated ectodomain gd alone complex the
ectodomain cellular receptor hvea. two bound anions suggest possible
binding sites another gd receptor, 3-o-sulfonated heparan sulfate.
unexpectedly, structures reveal v-like immunoglobulin (ig) fold core
of gd closely related cellular adhesion molecules flanked large
n- c-terminal extensions. receptor binding segment gd, n-terminal
hairpin, appears conformationally flexible, suggesting conformational
change accompanying binding might part viral entry mechanism.
