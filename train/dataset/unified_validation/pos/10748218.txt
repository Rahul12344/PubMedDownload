hepatitis b virus (hbv) unique fourth open reading frame coding a
16.5-kda protein known hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx). importance of
hbx life cycle hbv well established, underlying
molecular function hbx remains controversial. previously identified a
proteasome subunit psma7 interacts specifically hbx the
saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system. demonstrate psmc1, an
atpase-like subunit 19 proteasome component, also interacts hbx and
psma7. analysis interacting domains among psma7, psmc1, hbx by
deletion site-directed mutagenesis suggested mutually competitive
structural relationship among polypeptides. competitive nature these
interactions demonstrated using modified yeast two-hybrid
dissociator system. crucial hbx sequences involved interaction psma7 
and psmc1 important function transcriptional coactivator. hbx,
while functioning coactivator ap-1 acidic activator vp-16 in
mammalian cells, effect transactivation function their
functional orthologs gcn4 gal4 yeast. overexpression psmc1 seemed to
suppress expression various reporters mammalian cells; effect,
however, overcome coexpression hbx. addition, hbx expression
inhibited cellular turnover c-jun ubiquitin-arg-beta-galactosidase,
two well known substrates ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. thus, interaction 
of hbx proteasome complex metazoan cells may underlie functional 
basis proteasome cellular target hbx.
