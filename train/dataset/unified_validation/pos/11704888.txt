we describe effect pretreatment alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2m) the
susceptibility human neuroblastoma sknmc cell line infection herpes 
virus type 1 (hsv-1). elisa co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed 
a2m-hsv-1 interaction vitro. indirect immunofluorescence shows a2m
exacerbated cytopathic effect induced hsv-1 infection. however,
a2m-pretreated sknmc cells notably produced fewer hsv-1 particles the
untreated cells, suggesting a2m could induce restrictive infection.
furthermore, high levels hsv-1 a2m induced production nitric oxide 
(no) sknmc. preliminary results suggest a2m might induce apoptosis in
hsv-1-infected cells. findings affirm conclusion a2m may interact 
directly hsv-1 modulate course infection sknmc human
neuroblastoma cells.
