several cellular polypeptides critical growth regulation interact dna
tumor virus oncoproteins. p400 cellular protein binds the
adenovirus e1a oncoprotein(s). biological function p400 yet known, 
but structurally immunologically closely related p300 and
creb-binding protein, two known e1a-binding transcription adapters. like p300,
p400 phosphoprotein binds simian virus 40 large tumor antigen
(t). anti-t coimmunoprecipitation experiments, staggered deletions spanning
the amino-terminal 250 amino acids abrogate binding either p400
or p300. species composed residues 251 708 bound p400 p300,
while species defective p53 binding unable bind either detectably. 
anti-p53 immunoprecipitates prepared cells containing wild-type also
contained p400 p300. hence, p400 p300 bind (directly or
indirectly) carboxyl-terminal fragment contains p53 binding
domain. since p53 binding domain contributes immortalizing and
transforming activities, t-p400 and/or t-p300 interactions may participate in
these functions.
