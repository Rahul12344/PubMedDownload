the adenoviral protein e1a associates multiple anticancer activities,
including stabilization p53 tumor suppressor, tested gene
therapy approaches clinical trials. identify potential e1a-binding proteins
involved e1a's anticancer activities, screened yeast two-hybrid library
and identified mdm4, mdm2-related p53-binding protein, novel e1a-binding 
protein. nh(2)-terminal region mdm4 cr1 domain e1a were
required interaction e1a mdm4. e1a preferentially bound to
mdm4 rather mdm2 formed complex p53 presence mdm4,
resulting stabilization p53 p14(arf)-independent manner. e1a
failed stabilize p53 absence mdm4, showing mdm4 required
for p53 stabilization e1a. moreover, e1a-mediated stabilization p53
occurred nucleus. although effect p53-mdm2 interaction, e1a
facilitated mdm4 binding p53 inhibited mdm2 binding mdm4, resulting 
decreased nuclear exportation p53. thus, findings highlighted novel
mechanism, whereby e1a stabilized p53 tumor suppressor mdm4.
