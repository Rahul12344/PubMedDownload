pkr (double-stranded rna-dependent protein kinase) important component of
host defense virus infection. binding dsrna two dsrbds (double-stranded 
rna binding domains) pkr modulates kinase activation. structural
features natural target rnas, bulges loops, effect 
binding two dsrbds pkr still remains unclear. using itc nmr, show
here bulge loop tar rna necessary high affinity 
binding dsrbd1-dsrbd2 pkr 1:1 stoichiometry. binding site 
dsrbd1-dsrbd2 spans upper bulge lower stem tar rna, based on
chemical shift mapping. backbone resonances 40 kda tar.dsrbd1-dsrbd2
were assigned. nmr chemical shift perturbation data suggest beta1-beta2 
loop dsrbd1 interacts tar rna, whereas dsrbd2 less
involved tar rna recognition. addition, residues interdomain
linker dsrbd1 dsrbd2 also show large chemical perturbations
indicating linker involved recognition tar rna. results
presented provide biophysical spectroscopic basis for
high-resolution structural studies, show local rna structural features
modulate recognition dsrbds.
