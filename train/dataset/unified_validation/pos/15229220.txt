epstein-barr virus (ebv) expresses immediate-early protein, rta, activate
the transcription ebv lytic genes lytic cycle. work identifies
ubc9 pias1 binding partners rta yeast two-hybrid screen. these
bindings verified glutathione s-transferase pull-down assay,
coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy. interactions appear cause 
rta sumoylation, rta sumoylated vitro also
sumoylated rta detected p3hr1 cells following lytic induction in
293t cells transfecting plasmids express rta sumo-1. moreover,
pias1 stimulates conjugation sumo-1 rta, thus acting e3 ligase.
furthermore, transfecting plasmids express ubc9, pias1, sumo-1 increases
the capacity rta transactivate promoter includes rta response
element, indicating modification sumo-1 increases transactivation
activity rta. study reveals rta sumoylated lys-19,
lys-213, lys-517 residues sumo-1 conjugation lys-19 residue
is crucial enhancing transactivation activity rta. results
indicate sumoylation rta may important ebv lytic activation.
