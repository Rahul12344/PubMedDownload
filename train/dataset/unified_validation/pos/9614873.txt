rep78 major regulatory protein adenoassociated virus (aav). rep78 is
able transcriptionally regulate three aav's promoters, well a
variety heterologous promoters. attempt understand mechanism of
action rep78 able regulate gene expression, investigating
rep78's possible protein-protein interaction basal transcription factors.
one critical basal transcription factor human tata binding protein,
tbp. tbp core factor required assemblage transcription
initiation complex, tfiid. report vitro interaction rep78
and tbp demonstrated three different assay systems, including
west(far)-western analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay-supershift, 
coimmunoprecipitation. furthermore, using yeast gal4 two-hybrid system, in
vivo interaction rep78 tbp also demonstrated. still, 
amino half rep78 shown needed rep78-tbp interaction. mutations
within region rep78 known defective transcriptional
regulatory ability, suggesting biological role interaction. thus,
rep78 may regulate transcription binding regulating tbp's numerous
interactions. furthermore, rep78 known bind least one other
transcription factor (sp 1) likely others, rep78 may function a
tbp-associated factor altered tfiid-like complex.
