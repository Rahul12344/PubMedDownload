the moloney murine leukemia virus (mmlv) belongs retroviridae family of
enveloped viruses, known acquire minute amounts host cellular
proteins surface inside virion. despite extensive use 
retroviral vectors experimental clinical applications, repertoire of
host proteins incorporated mmlv vector particles remains unexplored. we
report identification host proteins highly purified retroviral
vector preparations obtained rate-zonal ultracentrifugation. viral proteins
were fractionated one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, in-gel tryptic digested, subjected liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. immunogold electron microscopy 
studies confirmed presence several host membrane proteins exposed the
vector surface. studies led identification 27 host proteins on
mmlv vector particles derived 293 hek cells, including 5 proteins previously
described part wild-type mmlv. nineteen host proteins identified
corresponded intracellular proteins. total eight host membrane proteins
were identified, including cell adhesion proteins integrin beta1 (fibronectin
receptor subunit beta) hmfg-e8, tetraspanins cd81 cd9, late endosomal
markers cd63 lamp-2. identification membrane proteins retroviral
surface particularly attractive, since serve anchoring sites for
the insertion tags targeting purification purposes. implications of
our findings retrovirus-mediated gene therapy discussed.
