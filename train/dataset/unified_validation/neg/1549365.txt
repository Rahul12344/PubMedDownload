in earlier study found different forms v-myb oncogene transform
myeloid cells resemble either monoblasts [when v-myb avian
myeloblastosis virus (amv) used] promyelocytes [when point mutant in
v-myb amv used; introna, m., golay, j., frampton j., nakano, t., ness,
s.a. & graf, t. (1990). cell, 63, 1287-1297]. present study have
searched genes expressed amv mutant-transformed promyelocytes not
expressed amv-transformed monoblasts using differential screening approach. 
eight different genes identified among 500 differentially
expressed clones. abundant previously identified
myb-regulated mim-1 gene. others found encode small calcium-binding
(mrp-like) protein; p20k protein; goose-type lysozyme; ribonuclease
a/angiogenin-related protein; three non-identified proteins. although these
genes appear rather lineage restricted, expression varied in
different subtypes transformed myelomonocytic cells, two them
(goose lysozyme ribonuclease) showed similar expression pattern normal
promyelocytes macrophages, suggesting aberrant gene regulation the
transformed cells. co-transfection experiments reporter construct containing
the promoter ribonuclease a-related gene indicated promoter is
regulated v-myb oncoprotein without involvement myb-specific
binding sequences.
