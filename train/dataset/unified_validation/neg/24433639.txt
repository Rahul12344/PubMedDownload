two culicoides-borne diseases, bluetongue (btv) schmallenberg, emerged
in european cattle population since 2006. diseases transmitted these
vectors could emerge. justifies development syndromic surveillance
programs whereby one several indicators would routinely monitored the
early detection emerging diseases. aim study evaluate milk 
yield milk recording dairy cattle indicator included an
emerging disease surveillance system. hypothesized emergences would
result episodes low milk production clustered space time. 2007
btv epizootic france used case study. already emerged 
in neighbouring countries, disease emergence expected notification
was mandatory. herd-test-day milk productions predicted entire
country 2006 2007 herd historical data using linear mixed models.
the differences observed predicted milk productions averaged per
week per municipality used input space-time prospective scan
statistic. log likelihood ratios (llr) associated clusters used to
define alarms. threshold chosen trade-off detection timeliness 
and number false alarms per week. first four btv notifications
occurred 12th (two notifications), 13th 27th july 2007. 12th of
july considered date emergence. alarms occurring 1st 
of march 2007 considered false alarms. using llr 50, 
an average 1.7 false alarms per week btv emergence detected seven 
weeks emergence. using llr 100, average 0.8 false
alarms per week btv emergence detected 9 weeks emergence.
detection may delayed discontinuation milk recording
between mid-july mid-august. first cluster llr>100 located the
emergence area investigated. difference observed and
predicted production >1 kg/cow/day observed around time emergence. 
however, difference equal magnitude observed year preceding
the outbreak. milk production predicted herd history alone allow the
detection 2007 btv emergence france. research be
conducted improving prediction test-day milk yield combining 
with indicators based routinely collected data.
