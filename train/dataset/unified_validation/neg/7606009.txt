human plasma-derived protein concentrates intended clinical use must be
treated viral inactivation ensure patient safety. study explored 
use liquid iodine inactivation several lipid- nonlipid-enveloped
viruses antithrombin iii (at-iii) concentrate. iodine levels 0.01% to
0.02% caused 43% 94% loss at-iii activity, well degradation 
of at-iii shown sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(sds-page) western blot analysis. however, addition 0.1% human
albumin protected at-iii inactivation fragmentation. at
albumin levels sufficient retain greater 75% at-iii activity, greater 
than 6 logs sindbis, encephalomyocarditis, vesicular stomatitis viruses,
greater 4 logs pseudorabies, greater 3 logs human
immunodeficiency virus inactivated. except sindbis virus, this
represented complete inactivation viruses spiked at-iii
concentrate.
