cobalt(iii) schiff base complexes shown inhibit replication of
the ocular herpes virus. well known complexes high
affinity nitrogenous donors histidine residues, possible
that bind (and inhibit) enzyme crucial viral replication.
in model studies, found [co(acacen)(nh3)2]+ effective
irreversible inhibitor thermolysin millimolar concentrations; also
inhibits human alpha-thrombin. axial ligand exchange active-site
histidine proposed mechanism inhibition. activity thermolysin
and thrombin protected binding reversible inhibitor active
site addition cobalt(iii) complex.
