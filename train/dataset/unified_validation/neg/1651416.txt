in attempt distinguish simian virus 40 (sv40) large antigen (t) binding
to atp hydrolysis, specific mutations made atp-binding site t
according model site (m. k. bradley, t. f. smith, r. h. lathrop,
d. m. livingston, t. a. webster, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 84:4026-4030,
1987). two acidic residues predicted make contact magnesium phosphate
were changed alanines. mutated gene completely defective viral
dna synthesis virion production, dominant defective viral 
dna replication. defective gene encoded stable product (2905t) that
oncogenically transformed mouse cell lines. 2905t, immunoprecipitated from
transformed-cell extracts, bound sv40 origin dna specifically and, surprisingly, 
it active atpase. recombinant baculovirus constructed the
production purification mutant protein detailed biochemical
analyses. 2905t 10% atpase helicase wild-type t. km of
2905t atp atpase assays km wild-type t. atp
activated atpase activity wild-type t, 2905t. tested gel 
bandshift assay, 2905t bound sv40 origin dna individual sites ii 
with affinities similar wild type. however, atp modulate
the dna-binding activity mutant site ii. therefore, mutation 
atp-binding site resulted defects interaction protein 
and atp appeared responsible determination active state
of dna binding versus atpase.
