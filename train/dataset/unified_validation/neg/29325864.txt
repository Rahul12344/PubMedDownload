in autoimmune disease combination infection, genetic environmental
factors causes autoimmune response thyroid gland (characterized by
lymphocytic infiltrations), thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (tshr) and
different thyroid antigens. graves' hashimoto disease autoimmune
disorders genetic predisposition. cd40 stimulates proliferation and
differentiation lymphocytes essential immunomodulatory component for
follicular cells thyroid cell present antigen. cd40,
ptpn22 thyroid-specific genes immunomodulating genes tsh receptor
and thyroglobulin. cd40 used associated graves's disease positional
candidate basis graves' disease linkage study connecting 20q11
genome chromosomal region. ptpn22 gene gives rise substantial risk of
specific autoimmune phenotypes frequent disease mechanisms. infections have
been implicated pathogenesis aitd including coxsackie virus, yersinia
enterocolitica, borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori retroviruses
(htlv-1, hfv, hiv sv40). infectious hepatitis c agents strongest
proof supporting affiliation aitd. essential environmental triggers
of aitd iodine, drugs, infection, smoking perhaps stress. autoimmune
disease provide important facts genetic mechanisms influence the
prognosis treatment disease recent molecular techniques through
gene expression study quantitative real time-pcr microarray, can
identify novel genes responsible graves' hashimoto disease.
