background: rpb5-mediating protein (rmp) associated rna polymerase ii
subunit rpb5. protein functionally counteracts transcriptional
activation hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) competitively binding the
rpb5; however, effects rmp hepatitis b virus (hbv) transcription and
replication remain unknown.
objectives: purpose study investigate effect rmp on
viral transcription replication vivo using hydrodynamic-based hbv
replication mouse model.
materials methods: male balb/c mice transfected wild type (1.2 wt) 
or hbx minus hbv plasmids (1.2x (-)) without hbx rmp, to
establish hbv replication mouse model hydrodynamic injection the
tail vein. hbv rna hbv dna replication intermediates (ri) analyzed
in liver.
results: rpb5-mediating protein could inhibit hbv transcription replication
in groups transfected 1.2 wt hbx. inhibitory effect disappeared 
in 1.2x (-) groups, yet reappeared groups co-transfected 1.2x 
(-) hbx. inhibitory effect indicated low dose rmp (0.3 ug, 0.5
ug 0.7 ug) compared control group groups received high
doses rmp.
conclusions: study demonstrated low dose rmp could inhibit hbv
transcription replication, dependent appearance hbx in
vivo.
