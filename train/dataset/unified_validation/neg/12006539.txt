purpose: human papillomavirus (hpv) type-16 associated invasive
squamous cell carcinoma head neck. study examines role of
hpv-16 progression oral head neck cancer determining the
quantity hpv-16 dna premalignant malignant lesions, using real-time
quantitative pcr, accurately determine role hpv-16 oral head
and neck squamous cell carcinogenesis.
experimental design: examined 102 microdissected premalignant head neck
lesions (85 oral cavity), 34 invasive oral cavity squamous cell
carcinomas, well 18 invasive tumors known hpv positive traditional
molecular technology presence hpv-16 dna using real-time quantitative 
pcr.
results: hpv dna detected 1 102 premalignant lesions (0.98%), 1 34
(2.9%) invasive oral cavity carcinomas, 14 18 (78%) known hpv-positive
tumors.
conclusions: hpv-16 infection integration seldom found oral
premalignant lesions invasive carcinoma, therefore rarely contributes 
malignant progression oral cavity. furthermore, quantitative pcr a
useful technique reliably excludes contaminated samples with
minimal hpv dna content unlikely significant carcinogenesis.
