the morphological features spontaneous, multifocal vascular neoplasm of
chickens described. histologically, tumor characterized areas
consisting freely anastomosing vascular channels prominent papillary
appearance lined bland-looking endothelial cells, alternate with
areas resembling cavernous hemangioma. occasionally solid areas composed of
plump, pleomorphic cells also present. although clear evidence 
for metastatic spread, tumors obviously invasive. electron microscopy
and immunohistochemistry confirmed endothelial nature neoplastic cells,
demonstrating particular pinocytic vesicles, well developed junctional
complexes, fragmented basal lamina, occasional weibel-palade bodies, patchy
factor viii-related antigen immunoreactivity. overall appearance tumor
was cavernous hemangioma prominent papillary endothelial
hyperplasia. previously shown tumor induced newly
isolated strain avian hemangioma retrovirus study demonstrated 
typical type c retrovirus particles tumor electron microscopy. is
suggested retrovirus-induced avian tumor may serve useful model
for study transformed endothelia vascular tumorigenesis.
