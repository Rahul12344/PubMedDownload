the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) protease cleaved two autoprocessing
sites viral maturation, one shares amino acid identity its
substrate, icp35. similar autoprocessing sites observed within other
members herpesviridae. introduction point mutations within the
autoprocessing sites hsv-1 protease indicated specificity resides
within p4-p1' region cleavage sites.
