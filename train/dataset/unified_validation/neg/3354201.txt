rna-dependent rna polymerase activities detected purified particles of
white clover cryptic viruses 1 2. polymerases two viruses had
different requirements optimum activity. enzyme activity dependent upon
the presence virus particles, mg2+, four ribonucleoside triphosphates,
and insensitive actinomycin d, alpha-amanitin, rifampicin. labeled
reaction products dsrnas indicated cf 11 column chromatography 
their ionic-strength-dependent sensitivity hydrolysis rnase and
resistance s1 nuclease. dsrnas synthesized vitro same
electrophoretic mobilities corresponding viral templates.
