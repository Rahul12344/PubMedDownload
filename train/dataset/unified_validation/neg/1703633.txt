gtpase-activating protein (gap) cytosolic protein stimulates rate
of hydrolysis gtp (gtp gdp) bound normal p21ras, catalyze
the hydrolysis gtp bound oncogenic, activated forms ras protein.
transformation cells v-src activated transforming variants c-src or
stimulation cells epidermal growth factor resulted stable
association gap two tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins 64 kda
(p64) 190 kda (p190). analysis gap immune complexes isolated extracts
of metabolically labeled src-transformed cells epidermal growth
factor-stimulated cells indicated tyrosine phosphorylation p64 p190
appeared coincident stable association proteins gap.
quantitation amount p64 associated gap v-src-transformed cells,
however, indicated 15 25% tyrosine-phosphorylated p64 found
in complex gap. mutations within sh2 region pp60src render
activated pp60src defective transformation inhibited efficient formation 
of complexes gap tyrosine-phosphorylated forms p64 p190.
from data, suggest tyrosine phosphorylation stable association 
of p64 gap important step mediating cellular signaling 
p21ras-gap pathway.
