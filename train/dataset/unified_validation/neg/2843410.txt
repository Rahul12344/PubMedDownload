diabetogenic strains coxsackievirus b4 (cb4) produce diabetes syndrome in
susceptible mice resembles insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. assess
the possible role autoimmunity, expression 64,000-mr islet antigen in
sjl/j cd1 mice infected diabetogenic strain cb4 monitored in
early late infection. additionally, virus-induced abnormalities glucose
metabolism correlated several changes purified islets assess
beta-cell physiology. 80% mice exhibited subnormal blood glucose at
72 h postinfection (p.i.) hyperglycemic 6 8 wk p.i. islet yield
in infected mice decreased 29-47% 72 h 6 wk p.i. compared to
noninfected mice. insulin release stimulated 16.7 mm glucose increased greater
than twofold 72 h p.i. declined 6 wk well level of
noninfected mice. likewise, residual islet insulin content release also
increased 72 h declined. total protein synthesis islets
decreased 30% 72 h 60% 6 wk p.i. although synthesis five
proteins heterogeneous molecular weights, including tubulin, severely
depressed infected islets 72 h p.i. compared control islets or
islets 6 wk p.i., synthesis 64,000-mr component another protein 
36,000 mr increased two- threefold. possible cb4 infection may
initiate enhance autoimmune reaction increased expression the
64,000-mr antigen.
