the quantity receptors expressed specialized cells hormones, foreign
antigenic substances, chemical stimuli diminishes associate 
with ligands, correlating specific reduction responsiveness 
cell stimulation. ligand-induced adaptation membrane receptors may 
be akin antigenic modulation--the reversible disappearance of
membrane-associated determinants stimulated specific antibodies. antigenic
modulation studied extensively thymus-leukemia (tl) system of
mouse leukemias. antibody-induced changes quantities tl antigens
expressed asl-1 rada-1 cells, independently arising leukemia cell lines of
strain mice, outgrowths metabolic turnover. interacting with
tl antibodies, rate tl antigen disappearance membrane increases
while rate antigen synthesis remains unchanged. antiserum with

tumor-associated antigen, leads modulation tl antigens alone; tumor
antigen persists. selectivity modulation taken indication that

antiserum affects membrane antigen expression investigated. metabolic
half-lives three antigen determinants investigated distinct from

similarities antigenic modulation regulation exist, among 
are fate receptor-ligand complexes, changes metabolism after
binding ligand, dependence reactions upon continued sources
