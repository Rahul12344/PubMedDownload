the accessory recombination function (arf) gene bacteriophage p22 located
immediately upstream essential recombination function (erf) gene. three
mutant alleles arf constructed installed p22 place the
wild-type allele: out-of-frame internal deletion, in-frame internal
deletion, amber mutation. deletion mutant phages partially
defective homologous recombination plaque formation wild-type reca 
hosts; defects severe recb reca recb hosts. amber
mutant phage exhibits growth phenotypes nonsuppressing hosts, not
in amber-suppressor host. plasmids express arf complement growth
defect arf- phages. plasmids stimulate erf-mediated recombination; 
were also found cause small stimulation reca-recbcd-mediated homologous
recombination phage lambda.
