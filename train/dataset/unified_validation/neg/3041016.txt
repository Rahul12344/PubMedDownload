enhancer replication simian virus 40 core origin.

a number recent studies reported papovaviruses simian
virus 40 (sv40) polyomavirus, replication viral dna vivo is
activated viral transcriptional enhancer promoter sequences. viral
and cellular transcriptional enhancers well known ability to
activate transcription position- orientation-independent manner. 
present study, investigated effect position orientation 
sv40 72-base-pair (bp) repeat enhancer replication activation function. we
constructed plasmids containing one copy sv40 core origin and
enhancer placed either order orientation different distances from
each other. assayed replication efficiencies plasmids the
presence internal control plasmid cos-1 monkey kidney cells producing
the sv40 antigen required replication. found 72-bp repeat was
capable activating replication equally well either orientation placed 
8 9 bp core origin. activation replication totally
abolished, replication efficiencies instances found lower 
than obtained core origin alone, 72-bp repeat was
separated core origin distances 99 bp more. direct 
contrast situation polyomavirus, activation replication
by homologous enhancer sv40 72-bp repeat enhancer known be
position independent. also found sv40 core origin 72-bp 
repeat enhancer adjacent other, efficient activation replication 
was obtained end core origin containing 17-bp + block 
was linked enhancer. orientation core origin,
activation replication either diminished abolished. hypotheses 
alteration chromatin structure enhancer interaction between
trans-acting factors binding enhancer core origin mediating the
activation effect discussed.
