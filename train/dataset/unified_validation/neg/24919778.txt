background: previous cohort studies demonstrated beneficial effects of
antiretroviral therapy (art) viral load suppression. aimed examine the
factors associated virologic suppression hiv-infected patients art
receiving care evandro chagas clinical research institute, oswaldo cruz
foundation rio de janeiro, brazil.
methods: hiv-1 rna levels cd4+ t-cell counts date closest midyear
(1 july) evaluated 1,678 art-naïve patients ≥ 18 years age initiating
art 1997 2010. odds ratios (or) 95% confidence intervals (ci)
for undetectable viral load (≤ 400 copies/ml) estimated using
generalized estimating equations regression models adjusted clinical and
demographic factors. time-updated covariates included age, years since hiv
diagnosis, hepatitis c diagnosis art interruptions.
results: 1997 2011, proportion patients undetectable
viral load increased 6% 78% median [interquartile range] cd4+
t-cell count increased 207 [162, 343] 554 [382, 743] cells/μl.
pre-treatment median cd4+ t-cell count significantly increased the
observation period 114 [37, 161] 237 [76, 333] cells/μl (p < .001). the
per-year adjusted (aor) undetectable viral load 1.18 (95% ci = 
1.16-1.21). art interruptions >1 month per calendar significantly decreased the
odds [aor = 0.32 (95% ci = 0.27-0.38)] undetectable viral load.
patients initiating protease inhibitor (pi)-based first-line regimen were
less likely undetectable viral load [aor = 0.72 (95% ci = 0.63-0.83)]
compared initiating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(nnrti)-based regimen.
conclusions: results demonstrate significant improvements virologic
outcomes 1997 2011, persisted adjusting factors.
this may part due improvements care new treatment options. nnrti-
versus pi-based first-line regimens found associated increased
odds undetectable viral load, consistent previous studies.
treatment interruptions found important determinant not
having undetectable viral load. studies needed characterize reasons
for treatment interruptions develop subsequent strategies improving
adherence art.
