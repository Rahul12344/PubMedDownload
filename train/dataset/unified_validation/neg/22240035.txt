the protonation histidine acidic environments underpins role in
regulating function ph-sensitive proteins. ph-sensitive viral fusion
proteins, histidine protonation endosome leads activation 
membrane fusion function. hcv (hepatitis c virus) glycoprotein e1-e2
heterodimer mediates membrane fusion within endosome, roles of
conserved histidine residues formation functional heterodimer 
sensing ph changes unknown. examined functional roles conserved
histidine residues located within e1 e2. e1 mutations, h222a/r, h298r and
h352a, disrupted e1-e2 heterodimerization reduced virus entry. total of
five six histidine residues located within e2 rbd (receptor-binding
domain) important e2 fold, substitution arginine or
alanine caused aberrant heterodimerization and/or cd81 binding. distinct roles in
e1-e2 heterodimerization virus entry identified his691 his693
respectively within membrane-proximal stem region. viral entry cell-cell 
fusion neutral low ph values enhanced h445r, indicating the
protonation state his445 key regulator hcv fusion. however, h445r 
not overcome block virus entry induced bafilomycin a1, indicating a
requirement endosomal activation trigger addition acidic ph.
