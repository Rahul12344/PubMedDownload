since 2001, outbreaks nipah virus occurred almost every year in
bangladesh high case-fatality rates. epidemiological data suggest in
bangladesh, nipah virus transmitted natural reservoir, fruit bats, to
humans via consumption date palm sap contaminated bats, subsequent
human-to-human transmission. experimentally investigate epidemiological
association drinking date palm sap human cases nipah virus
infection, determined viability nipah virus (strain
bangladesh/200401066) artificial palm sap. 22°c virus titers remained
stable least 7 days, thus potentially allowing food-borne transmission.
next, modeled food-borne nipah virus infection supplying syrian hamsters
with artificial palm sap containing nipah virus. drinking 5×10⁸ tcid₅₀ of
nipah virus resulted neurological disease 5 8 hamsters, indicating
that food-borne transmission nipah virus indeed occur. comparison,
intranasal (i.n.) inoculation dose nipah virus resulted in
lethal respiratory disease animals. animals infected nipah virus
via drinking, virus detected respiratory tissues rather the
intestinal tract. using fluorescently labeled nipah virus particles, showed
that drinking, substantial amount virus deposited lungs,
explaining replication nipah virus respiratory tract these
hamsters. besides ability nipah virus infect hamsters via drinking 
route, syrian hamsters infected via route transmitted virus through
direct contact naïve hamsters 2 24 transmission pairs. although
these findings directly prove date palm sap contaminated nipah
virus bats origin nipah virus outbreaks bangladesh, provide 
the first experimental support hypothesis. understanding nipah virus
transmission cycle essential preventing mitigating future outbreaks.
