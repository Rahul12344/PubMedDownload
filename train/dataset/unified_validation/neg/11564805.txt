the hypervariable region 1 (hvr1) e2 protein hepatitis c virus (hcv) is
a highly heterogeneous sequence promiscuously recognized human sera
via binding amino acid residues conserved physicochemical properties. 
generated panel mabs mice immunized hvr1 surrogate peptides
(mimotopes) affinity-selected sera hcv-infected patients phage
display library. high number specific clones obtained immunization
with pool nine mimotopes, resulting mabs shown recognize
several 16- 27-mer peptides derived natural hvr1 sequences isolated from
patients acute chronic hcv infection, suggesting hvr1 mimotopes
were efficient antigenic immunogenic mimics naturally occurring hcv
variants. moreover, mabs shown bind hvr1 context a
complete soluble form e2 glycoprotein, indicating recognition correctly
folded hvr1. addition, highly promiscuous mab able specifically
capture bona fide viral particles (circulating hcv rna) well rhcv-like
particles assembled insect cells expressing structural viral polypeptides
derived hcv 1a isolate. findings demonstrate possible to
induce broadly cross-reactive clonal ab response multiple hcv variants. in
consideration potentially important role hvr1 virus binding to
cellular receptor(s), mechanism could exploited induction of
neutralizing abs specific large repertoire viral variants.
