objective: evaluate 3 different clinical management strategies for
patients cervical cytological atypical squamous cells undetermined
significance (asc-us) recommended guideline 2001 bethesda system
and 2001 american society colposcopy cervical pathology (asccp).
methods: 1394 patients cytopathological diagnosis asc-us use of
liquid-based thin-layer preparation managed three different clinical
strategies, evaluated percentage histological diagnosis > =
high-grade intraepithelial lesion (hsil), i.e., cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (cin2 3) standard. 421 patients group underwent
colposcopically directed cervical biopsy, 475 patients group b were
followed-up 6 months cytology, colposcopy biopsy performed if
the results > = asc-h asc-us hpv-dna (+). 498 patients group c:
underwent hc-ii test, colposcopy biopsy performed aged > =
30 hpv-dna (+), patients aged < 30 hpv-dna 
(+), hc-ii test cytology would performed 6 months; colposcopy and
biopsy performed results > = asc-h hpv-dna (+).
results: (1) results histological diagnosis > = cin2 found 27
cases (6.41%) group a, 26 cases (5.78%) group b, 34 cases (6.91%) of
group c. statistically significant difference among 3 groups
(all p > 0.05). (2) convenience significantly different among 3 groups 
(p < 0.01). workloads doctors discomfort resulting from
biopsy patients greatest group a. patient's compliance of
group b low necessity wait follow-up six months later. 
the cost group c relatively higher. (3) group c, 66% asc-us
patients hpv-dna (+) aged > = 30. percentage histological
diagnosis > = cin2 5.69% aged > = 30 1.22% those
aged < 30.
conclusion: protocols b c practical clinical management of
asc-us china. hpv infection necessary cause cervical carcinoma, so
the protocol c (cytology hc-ii test) better cervical lesion screening.
the asc-us patients aged > = 30 hpv-dna (+) high risk.
