an antiviral protein released mosquito cells persistently infected with
sindbis virus. differences sensitivity production this
virus-specific activity apparent three independently produced aedes
albopictus cell lines. activity inhibits total viral rna synthesis a
time-dependent manner. antiviral effect maximally realized cells 
treated activity 48 h infections. data suggest the
antiviral activity induces antiviral state treated cells prevents the
formation efficient function viral rna-synthesizing complexes.
