pcr is, date, available tool detection gb virus c (gbv-c) 
and hepatitis g virus (hgv) rnas. twenty-two french laboratories participated 
a quality control study assess sensitivity specificity their
procedures. panel included 13 positive controls 7 negative controls. 
laboratories used either in-house pcr techniques adapted literature or
partly standardized commercial tests. three laboratories performed faultlessly
with entire panel. laboratories excellent specificity (100% 20 of
22 laboratories). sensitivity acceptable (85 100%) 15 centers and
insufficient (38 77%) 7. nonstandardized in-house pcr, the
commercial assays gave discrepant performances different laboratories. these
results suggest laboratories willing use pcr detection gbv-c/hgv
rna research diagnostic purposes participate multicenter quality
control trials.
