the beta-subunit insulin receptor possesses tyrosine-specific protein
kinase activity may play role coupling insulin binding insulin
action. previously, identified substrate receptor-associated
protein kinase cell-free system. endogenous substrate (pp120), which
appeared glycoprotein apparent mol wt 120,000, detected in
rat liver microsomes. present work, demonstrated pp120 is
localized highly purified preparation rat liver plasma membranes (neville
preparation). moreover, pp120 appears specific liver, been
detected liver rat, monkey, rabbit, rat brain, skeletal
muscle, heart, kidney, adipocytes. preliminary addressing question
of whether insulin stimulates phosphorylation pp120 intact cells, have
sought identify tissue culture cell lines contain insulin receptors 
and pp120. succeeded identifying pp120 two cell lines derived 
rat liver: 1) h35 hepatoma cells (reuber hepatoma) 2) rat hepatocytes
transformed temperature-sensitive mutant form sv-40 (cultivated both
permissive nonpermissive temperatures). conclusion, pp120 appears 
liver-specific plasma membrane glycoprotein serves substrate for
phosphorylation insulin receptor-associated protein kinase soluble
cell-free system. presence pp120 cultured cell lines facilitate
investigation whether phosphorylation pp120 intact cells is
physiologically regulated response insulin.
