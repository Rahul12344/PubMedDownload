the natural reservoirs avian influenza virus (aiv) wild bird species of
the orders anseriformes charadriiformes. primary route transmission
for wild birds fecally contaminated surface water shared aquatic
habitats. distilled water model shown aiv remains infectious water 
for weeks months ph, salinity, temperature affecting stability. to
evaluate effect ph, salinity, temperature aiv persistence in
natural surface water, measured duration infectivity two common low
pathogenic aiv subtypes 15 filtered surface water samples collected major
waterfowl habitats georgia, usa. trials performed three incubation
temperatures 10, 17, 28 c. consistent previous studies, ph and
temperature significant effect stability aiv filtered surface 
water. viruses less stable warmer temperatures acidic water
(ph <5.0). due limited range salinity field water samples, the
role salinity aiv stability surface water could adequately be
evaluated. variations persistence times water samples comparable 
ph salinities indicated factors affect aiv stability natural
surface water. results contribute current understanding aiv
persistence aquatic habitats may help identifying areas an
increased likelihood aiv persistence potential transmission.
