using cre-loxp-mediated recombination, established highly efficient and
reproducible system generates autonomous hpv-18 genomes primary human
keratinocytes (phks), organotypic raft cultures recapitulated a
robust productive program. e7 promoted s-phase re-entry numerous
suprabasal differentiated cells, hpv dna unexpectedly amplified following a
prolonged g2 arrest mid- upper spinous cells. viral dna levels
intensified, e7 activity diminished extinguished. cells then
exited cell cycle undergo virion morphogenesis. high titers progeny
virus generated indistinguishable productive infection na√Øve phk raft
cultures before, never achieved now. immortalization-defective
hpv-18 e6 mutant genome also characterized first time. numerous cells
accumulated p53 protein, without inducing apoptosis, productive program
was severely curtailed. complementation mutant genomes e6-expressing
retrovirus restored proper degradation p53 well viral dna amplification 
and l1 production. system invaluable hpv genetic dissection 
serves faithful ex vivo model investigating infections and
interventions.
