in 1984, author first developed simple, quick, non-invasive, economical
method detecting cancer specific internal organs, using bi-digital
o-ring test (bdort), microscope slide specific cancer specific
internal organ reference control substance. detection rate cancer
screening much greater standard diagnostic tests. imaging 
was performed using bdort, area positive response cancer
positive slide often much greater actual size cancer itself. 
this due fact cancer tissue lungs digestive
system contained viruses htlv-3 (often found adenocarcinoma the
lung, stomach, head pancreas, colon) htlv-1 (often found small-cell 
carcinoma lung certain types leukemia). extent virus
positive area often far greater cancer tissue was
distributed much greater area surrounding cancer. reason, the
virus alone showed response could mistaken cancer tissue. the
author succeeded differentiating exact location cancer tissue itself
from surrounding cancer related virus (with without microbes) positive
area using pair identical microscope slides cancer tissue. 
one slides exposed ultra-violet rays (peak wavelength 253.7 nm
mercury vapor atomic resonance spectral line) 40 seconds-4 minutes. after
this exposure, bdort response virus (with without microbes)
associated cancer tissue completely eliminated, response
to cancer tissue maintained. using ultraviolet exposed cancer slide,
the imaging part body responded virus-free cancer
slide indicated actual location cancer tissue, often
confirmed standard x-ray imaging methods thickness the
tumor relatively large. cancers detectable standard laboratory tests
had strikingly weakening response bdort (-3.5 -4), ultra-violet
exposed cancer slide well antibody oncogen c-fos. smallest size 
of cancer tissue detected method less 1mm diameter the
very early stage cancer, usually cannot detected current
laboratory tests.(abstract truncated 400 words)
