infectious agents, hcv, account ∼15% human cancers. hcv infects
not hepatocytes also extrahepatic cells. chronic hcv infection can
induce chronic inflammation qualitative quantitative alterations 
immune repertoire tissue microenvironment, could induce various
neoplasias. epidemiological studies meta-analyses suggest increased rate
of extrahepatic cancers patients chronic hcv infection along a
higher risk intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer non-hodgkin
lymphoma (nhl), highlighting need screen hcv infection patients
with cancers. development b cell nhl associated hcv
infection, relative risk ∼1.5. direct transformation related the
presence virus chronic antigenic stimulation two major
non-exclusive mechanisms involved hcv-related lymphomagenesis. hcv infection
alters survival patients lymphoma, sustained virologic response (svr)
substantially improves prognosis. antiviral treatments might induce remission 
indolent lymphoma svr achieved even without chemotherapy, emphasizing the
role hcv lymphomagenesis context. however, studies needed to
provide prospective evidence causal relationship chronic hcv
infection extrahepatic cancers determine whether risk of
extrahepatic cancers reduced svr. review, report recent
studies analysing risk extrahepatic cancers associated chronic hcv
infection. although doubt regarding direct indirect causality
between hcv nhl, increased risk cancers less clear, the
exception cholangiocarcinoma.
