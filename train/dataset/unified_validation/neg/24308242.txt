the west nile virus (wnv) zoonotic arbovirus recently causing 
outbreaks many countries southern central europe. 2012, the
first time, caused outbreak eastern croatia total 7 human
clinical cases. aim assisting public health personnel order to
improve survey protocols vector control, high risk areas wnv
transmission estimated mapped. study area included cities osijek 
and slavonski brod 8 municipalities vukovarsko-srijemska county. risk
estimation based seroprevalence wnv infections horses an
indicator virus presence, well presence possible wnv mosquito
vectors corresponding vector competences. four mosquito species considered
as possible wnv vectors included study: aedes vexans, culex modestus,
culex pipiens ochlerotatus caspius. mosquitoes sampled using dry-ice
baited cdc trap, twice month, may october. study suggests that
the two mosquito species present main risk wnv transmission eastern
croatia: culex pipiens--because good vector competence aedes
vexans--because high abundances. result, two species
should focus future mosquito surveillance vector control management.
