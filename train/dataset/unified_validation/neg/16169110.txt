in study showed virulent moscow strain ectromelia virus
(ectv-mos) infection leads induction apoptosis balb/c mouse central 
nervous system. ectv-mos-infected cells inflammation sites found in
brain parenchyma 5 15 days footpad infection ectv-mos.
infected cells consisted microglia monocytes, astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes type cells underwent apoptosis within 5-15 days
post infection (d.p.i.). highest number apoptotic cells found 5 and
10 d.p.i. represented mainly microglia (61.4% 38.6% apoptotic cells,
respectively) astrocytes (21% 8.9%, respectively). number of
apoptotic oligodendrocytes 5.4% 4.5%, respectively. fluorometric assays
demonstrated involvement caspase-1, -3 -8 caspase-9 apoptosis
in ectv-mos-infected mouse brains. expression fas/fasl significantly
increased ectv-mos-infected cells 5 15 d.p.i., whereas fas was
up-regulated also surrounding, non-infected cells. taking together may 
conclude ectv-mos infection microglia astrocytes leads local
inflammation resulting fas/fasl up-regulation apoptosis, limits
mouse central nervous system infection ectv-mos.
