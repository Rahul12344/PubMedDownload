background & objectives: discrepancies exist reported prevalence portal
vein thrombosis (pvt), clinical characteristics sites occurrence
need elucidated. risk factors pvt also poorly understood. 
single centre study undertaken determine clinical characteristics,
sites occurrence, risk factors associated pvt patients liver 
cirrhosis.
methods: hospitalized cirrhotic patients (n = 162) segregated pvt
and non-pvt groups. indices possibly associated pvt measured pvt
was detected doppler ultrasonography computed tomography portal
angiography. portal vein diameter flow velocity splenic thickness
were measured ultrasonography.
results: pvt found 40 patients (24.7%); 34 pvt patients (85%), the
liver cirrhosis resulted hepatitis b virus infections. (90%) patients
were child-pugh classes b c, similar distribution groups.
pvt seen 20 patients portal superior mesenteric veins; ascites,
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice common findings in
pvt patients. haemoglobin levels blood platelet counts (bpcs) were
significantly lower splenic thickness greater pvt non-pvt
patients (p<0.01). significant positive correlation bpcs 
platelet aggregation rates (r = 0.533, p<0.01).
interpretation & conclusions: occurrence pvt 24.7 per cent, primarily 
in post-hepatitis b liver cirrhosis patients. pvt occurred mainly portal
vein trunk superior mesenteric vein. different pvt sites may account 
differing clinical presentations. lower levels haemoglobin bpcs as
well splenic thickening associated pvt. splenic thickening may 
risk factor pvt.
