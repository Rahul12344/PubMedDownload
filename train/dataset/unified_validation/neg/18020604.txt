over years, technology producing human rabies vaccines undergone 
many improvements. improvements consist use tissue cultures for
the production viral antigens, replacing former nervous tissue substrate
vaccines. low virus yields tissue cultures led development the
concentration purification virus supernatants. another technical
improvement obtained using microcarriers virus production vero cell
suspension cultures. technique permits commercial-scale production rabies
vaccine, lowering production costs thus extending availability the
vaccine broader population developing countries. besides improvements 
rabies vaccine production technology, use various vaccination regimens and
routes administration field trials resulted considerable gains in
our experience postexposure treatment (pet) disease. standard 
recommended regimen pet using concentrated purified tissue culture
vaccines consists 5-dose course intramuscular injections days 0, 3, 7,
14 28. reduced vaccination regimens 2-1-1 proven 
efficient raising protective antibody responses. reduction total volume
of rabies vaccine also possible using intradermal route injection,
provided vaccine administered several sites. overall consequence is
a progressive shift worldwide use rabies vaccines nervous
tissue origin contemporary tissue culture vaccines.
