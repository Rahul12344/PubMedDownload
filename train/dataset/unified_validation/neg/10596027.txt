hantaviruses rodent-borne viruses, they, mainly hantaan (htn)
serotype, causative agents group febrile nephropathies known as
"hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome (hfrs). " despite fact hfrs is
frequently reported china, annual incidence 50,000-100,000 cases,
one puzzling observation local case hfrs confirmed taiwan 
has yet explained. hypothesized hantavirus strain prevailing in
taiwan mainly belongs mild strain, seoul (seo) strain, absence
of severe disease related absence htn. test hypotheses,
this epidemiologic study performed, including seroprevalence survey and
phylogenetic analysis hantavirus isolated rodent population trapped
in major seaports, rural, mountainous areas taiwan. study also
included rodents viruses two isolated islands, kinmen matzu, which
are geographically adjacent east coast mainland china. a
total 5,461 rodents 16 species captured, r. norvegicus most
common species, antibody prevalence much higher international seaports
(20%) rural regions (approximately 5%) intermediate domestic 
seaports. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), 33.9% of
the seropositive r. norvegicus found amplifiable hantavirus
sequences lung tissues, subsequent phylogenetic analyses indicated
that almost hantavirus taiwan closely related prototype
seo strain, htn strain recovered rodent species indigenous to
taiwan. seroprevalence seo infection r. norvegicus kinmen matzu 
was also different southern provinces china closely resembled
that seaports taiwan, seo identified genetically linked to
taiwanese seo strains. results substantiate hypotheses, suggest
that epidemiology hantavirus infection taiwan different that
in china, htn seo strains hfrs concurrently prevail.
