risk factors suggestive relatively late exposure ebv consistently
associated hodgkin's disease (hd) younger adults. addition, evidence
of ebv infection found reed-sternberg cells about
one-third one-half hd cases. however, study yet published has
correlated childhood social environment risk factors presence of
ebv hodgkin's tumor cells. examined whether ebv-positive hd occurs those
patients whose childhood environment would predispose relatively late
exposure ebv. study population consisted 102 cases mixed cellularity
(mc; n = 25) nodular sclerosing (n = 77) hd. samples tested positive 
either ebv-encoded rna latent membrane protein considered
ebv-positive. 102 cases, 83 completed questionnaire regarding childhood 
social environment. association ebv-positivity estimated odds
ratio (or) 95% confidence intervals (ci). twenty-two percent cases
were ebv-positive. cases likely mc (or, 6.2; ci, 2.3-16.3) 
and male (or, 3.4; ci, 1.3-9.0). history infectious mononucleosis (im) not
predictive ebv-positivity, 3 14 patients ebv-positive 
(p = 0.82). contrary hypothesis, association ebv childhood 
environment risk factors identified. association ebv mc histology
and male gender agrees previous reports. intriguing finding the
dissociation im history ebv-positivity, almost the
cases history im ebv-negative.
