serologic diagnosis bovine paratuberculosis (johne's disease) currently
available tests may give false-positive results due cross-reactions avian
and bovine tuberculosis viruses infectious agents. indirect
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa) detection antibodies against
paratuberculosis based antigens mycobacterium avium subsp. avium
(a-elisa) m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (p-elisa) compared. despite
an expected higher specificity m. a. paratuberculosis p-elisa, 2
antigens equally suitable demonstration antibody m. a.
paratuberculosis cattle. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves was
used demonstrate possible antigenic relationship. area curve
(auc) calculated 2 roc curves. auc p-elisa roc
curve 0.9197, auc a-elisa roc curve 0.9149, demonstrating
a negligible difference efficiency 2 tests (z = 0.182).
