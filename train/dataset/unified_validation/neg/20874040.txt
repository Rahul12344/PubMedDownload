antiretroviral therapy significantly improved typical course human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection industrialized nations, life
expectancies associated infection increased. however, infection
rates generally remained unchanged, increases noted among certain
subpopulations. use systemic preexposure prophylaxis hiv infection has
been proposed intervention reduce risk disease transmission in
at-risk individuals. basis prophylaxis involves orchestrated use 
of antiretrovirals uninfected individuals either continuously before
high-risk situations, perinatal occupational exposure hiv, in
order reduce likelihood successful hiv infection. data use 
antiretrovirals prevent hiv infection scenarios support concept
of preexposure prophylaxis. preliminary animal studies focused use of
antiretrovirals prevent simian immunodeficiency virus infection macaque
monkeys, data provided support potential efficacy of
preexposure prophylaxis hiv humans. limited human data available,
however, studies ongoing. clinical trials focused use of
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate either alone combination emtricitabine. 
tenofovir-emtricitabine-based regimens may ideal, given drugs'
pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic properties. investigators surveyed 
at-risk individuals assess knowledge preexposure prophylaxis and
whether used intended use prevention strategy. routine use of
preexposure prophylaxis even knowledge existence appear very
limited. efficacy proved, use preexposure prophylaxis faces several
ethical issues. ultimately, success depend proof of
cost-effectiveness. many questions concerning optimal use of
preexposure prophylaxis hiv answered, however, use limited 
to research-related clinical investigations.
