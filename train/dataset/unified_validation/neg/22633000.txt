hiv-1 entry cells requires interaction hiv-1 envelope proteins
and membrane lipids. investigated mechanism neutralization hiv-1
infection primary monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm) murine monoclonal
antibody (mab) wr321. wr321 specifically binds phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. phosphoinositides present
not inner surface plasma membranes cells also the
surface virions. hiv-1 acquires lipids budding process.
pre-incubation wr321 virus mdm neutralized hiv-1
infection mdm. results demonstrate wr321 internalized when
it bound hiv-1. wr321 prevent entry hiv-1 mdm.
however, wr321 internalized along hiv-1 mab acted
intracellulary prevent release virions mdm also triggered 
release Î²-chemokines.
