nyvac-based recombinants expressing pertinent immunogens equine influenza
virus (eiv), pseudorabies virus (prv), japanese encephalitis virus (jev) and
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) used evaluate safety and
immunogenicity vector. administration either nyvac recombinants or
parenteral virus mice, horses swine well tolerated notable
local systemic reactivities. further, despite highly attenuated phenotype,
nyvac found function effectively immunization vehicle capable of
eliciting humoral cell-mediated immune responses.
