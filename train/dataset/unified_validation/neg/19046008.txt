objective: determine whether genogroup 1 porcine torque teno virus (g1-ttv)
can potentiate clinical disease associated porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2).
sample population: 33 gnotobiotic baby pigs.
procedures: pigs allocated 7 groups: group a, 5 uninoculated control
pigs 3 litters; group b, 4 pigs oronasally inoculated pcv2 alone; group
c, 4 pigs inoculated ip first-passage g1-ttv alone; group d, 4 pigs
inoculated ip fourth-passage g1-ttv alone; group e, 6 pigs inoculated ip
with first-passage g1-ttv oronasally inoculated pcv2 7 days later; 
group f, 6 pigs inoculated ip fourth-passage g1-ttv inoculated
oronasally pcv2 7 days later; group g, 4 pigs inoculated oro-nasally
with pcv2 inoculated ip fourth-passage g1-ttv 7 days later.
results: 6 12 pigs inoculated g1-ttv prior pcv2 developed acute onset 
of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (pmws). none pigs inoculated
with g1-ttv alone pcv2 alone challenge exposed g1-ttv after
establishment infection pcv2 developed clinical illness. uninoculated
control pigs remained healthy.
conclusions clinical relevance: data implicated g1-ttv another viral
infection facilitates pcv2-induced pmws. raises possibility that
torque teno viruses swine may contribute disease expression currently
associated single infectious agent.
