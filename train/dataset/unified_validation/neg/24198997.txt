phylogenetic analyses indicate canine influenza viruses (civs) (h3n8)
evolved contemporary equine influenza virus (eiv). despite genetic
relatedness eiv civ, recent evidence suggests civ unable to
infect, replicate, spread among susceptible horses. determine whether
equine h3n8 viruses equally lost ability infect, cause disease, and
spread among dogs, evaluated infectivity transmissibility recent 
florida sublineage eiv isolate dogs. clinical signs, nasal virus shedding, and
serological responses monitored dogs 21 days inoculation.
real-time reverse transcription-pcr hemagglutination inhibition assays showed
that viruses maintained ability infect replicate dogs
and result seroconversion. transmission eiv infected sentinel dogs,
however, restricted. furthermore, civ eiv exhibited similar sialic
acid- Î± 2,3-gal receptor-binding preferences upon solid-phase binding assays. the
results vivo experiments reported suggesting dogs are
susceptible eiv previous reports members laboratory showing
limited civ infection horses mirrored civ eiv infections
studies primary canine equine respiratory epithelial cells.
