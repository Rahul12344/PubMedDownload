nk cells critical control viral infections. studies shown
that efficient nk cell activation response infection vv vivo
requires multiple pathways, including nkg2d pathway. recently shown
that il-18 necessary activation nk cells upregulation of
the nkg2d ligand rae-1 dcs upon vv infection. however, il-18r signaling on
the accessory cells contributes rae-1 up-regulation remains defined. 
this study, found il-18-mediated rae-1 up-regulation accessory cells,
including macrophages dcs, dependent myd88-pi3k pathway. we
further found il-18 signaling pi3k led inhibition gsk-3, which
we found negative regulator rae-1. finally, demonstrated in
vivo inhibition gsk-3 could restore rae-1 up-regulation il18r-/- dcs and
partially rescue nk-cell activation vv, leading improved viral control
in il-18r-/- mice. results showed il18-dependent rae-1 up-regulation 
accessory cells mediated myd88-pi3k-gsk3 pathway. observations
may provide important insights design effective nk cell-based
immunotherapies.
