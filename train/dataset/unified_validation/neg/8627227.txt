neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (n-mabs) serotype g2 g4 rotaviruses
were used study intraserotypic variation selection characterization 
n-mab-resistant antigenic variants reaction n-mabs prototype
rotavirus strains. two g2-specific n-mabs reacted g2 rotaviruses s2, ds-1,
rv-5 rv-6 1076. sequence analysis gene encoding vp7 of
1076 virus showed differences amino acid sequence 1076 virus 
and g2 strains position 147, 213 217 correlated loss of
n-mab reactivity. rotavirus variant mutation mapping data suggested the
amino acid difference position 213 likely greatest importance.
rotavirus 1076 defined monotype b within g2 strains, whereas s2, ds-1,
rv-5 rv-6 belong monotype a. molecular basis g4 subtypes/monotypes
was also studied. monotype g4b n-mab 3a3 selected antigenic variant with
an amino acid mutation position 96, whereas variants g4a-reactive n-mab
st-3:1 showed mutation position 94, produced new, utilized
glycosylation site. neutralization n-mab st-3:1 also affected amino
acid changes position 96. reactions n-mabs show serotype g2
viruses divided monotypes confirm observation serotype
g4 rotaviruses subdivided subtypes/monotypes b. g2
monotypes relate differences particular amino acids within antigenic region
c possibly region b, whereas antigenic region important g4
monotype differentiation.
