background: coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (car) identified 
common cellular receptor viruses, biological pathogenic
relevance uncertain. knowledge car localization human cardiovascular
system limited important respect car-dependent viral infections
and gene transfer using car-dependent viral vectors.
methods results: explanted failing hearts 13 patients (8 dilated
cardiomyopathy [dcm] 5 heart diseases [non-dcm]) normal donor 
hearts (n=7) investigated expression levels subcellular
localization car adenovirus coreceptors alpha(v)beta(3) and
alpha(v)beta(5) integrins. car immunoreactivity low normal and
non-dcm hearts, whereas strong car signals occurred intercalated discs and
sarcolemma 5 8 dcm hearts (62.5%); strong signals colocalized
with integrins. hearts, car detectable subendothelial layers
of vessel wall, luminal endothelial surface, on
interstitial cells. human car (hcar) expressed rat cardiomyocytes targeted
to cell-cell contacts, resembled car localization dcm hearts and
resulted 15-fold increased adenovirus uptake.
conclusions: low hcar abundance may render normal human myocardium resistant to
car-dependent viruses, whereas re-expression hcar, observed in
dcm, may key determinant cardiac susceptibility viral infections.
asymmetric expression hcar vessel wall may important determinant 
of adenovirus tropism humans. hcar subcellular localization human
myocardium hcar targeting cell-cell contacts cardiomyocyte cultures
suggest hcar may play role cell-cell contact formation.
