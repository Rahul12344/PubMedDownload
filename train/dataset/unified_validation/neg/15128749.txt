chemokines family cytokines induce directed migration various
types leukocytes specific interactions group seven
transmembrane receptors. scavenger receptors heterogenous family of
transmembrane molecules commonly bind uptake oxidized low density
lipoprotein bacteria. here, show cxc chemokine 16
(cxcl16)/sr-psox, transmembrane chemokine scavenger receptor activity, but
also 12 15 chemokines examined efficiently bound scavenger receptor
ligands competition cells expressing specific chemokine receptors. 
furthermore chemotactic scavenger receptor activities of
sr-psox/cxcl16 similarly impaired series mutants altered the
chemokine domain, indicating sr-psox/cxcl16 binds scavenger receptor ligands
as well cxcr6 using highly overlapping binding motifs. taken together,
chemokines generally scavenger receptor-like activity their
receptor-binding domain, suggesting close evolutionary relationship between
chemokines scavenger receptors.
