background: little known whether woman's risk transmitting hiv
perinatally increases time whether infection outcome previous
child affects risk transmitting hiv subsequent children.
methods: analyzed data 114 prospectively followed women gave birth to
at least 2 children becoming infected hiv determine risk for
perinatal hiv transmission sibling pairs.
results: median interval sibling births 19 months. hiv infection 
occurred 19 (17%) older siblings 20 (18%) younger siblings (p = 0.87). two
(11%) 19 children infected older siblings infected compared with
18 (19%) 95 children uninfected older siblings (p = 0.86). risk
for transmission younger siblings associated interval between
deliveries two siblings.
conclusions: data demonstrate hiv-infected woman's risk of
transmitting hiv perinatally increases time, although observed
interpregnancy interval relatively short. risk perinatal transmission
does appear affected infection outcome previous children.
these findings may useful counseling hiv-infected women risk
of transmitting hiv perinatally.
