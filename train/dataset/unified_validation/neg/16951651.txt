the infection cd4 cells may significant involvement transmission
and long-term persistency hiv. using hiv clones carrying enhanced green
fluorescent protein (egfp), infected epithelial glioneuronal cell lines
derived female reproductive tract, brain, colon, intestine. hiv
infection quantified counting egfp-positive cells. infection was
quantified cell lines female reproductive tract, brain tissue, and
colon tissue (0.36%-3.15%). virus replicated infected cells the
progeny virus infectious cd4 cells, hela-cd4, cem lymphocytes.
furthermore, found infection epithelial brain cell lines 
independent gp120. results infection cd4 epithelial cells
suggest hiv traverse epithelial cell layers infecting 
gp120-independent mechanism. infection glial neuronal cell lines suggests 
that hiv infection cells probable mechanism hiv pathogenicity
in brain possible cause persistent infection patients.
