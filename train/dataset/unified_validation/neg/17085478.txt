paired metal ions proposed central catalytic mechanisms of
rnase h nucleases, bacterial transposases, holliday junction resolvases,
retroviral integrases many enzymes. present sensitive assay
for dna transesterification catalysis human immunodeficiency
virus-type 1 (hiv-1) integrase (in) connects two dna strands (disintegration
reaction), allowing detection using quantitative pcr (qpcr). present evidence 
suggesting three acidic residues active site function 
metal binding using metal rescue. method, catalytic acidic residues
were substituted cysteines. mn2+ binds tightly sulfur atoms of
the cysteine residues, mg2+ not. found mn2+, mg2+, could
rescue catalysis cysteine-substituted enzyme, providing evidence for
functionally important metal binding three residues. also used the
pcr-boosted assay show hiv-1 could carry transesterification
reactions involving dna 5' hydroxyl groups well 3' hydroxyls as
nucleophiles. lastly, show mn2+ (i.e. without enzyme) can
catalyze formation low level pcr-amplifiable product extreme
conditions, allowing us estimate rate enhancement due in-protein
scaffold least 60 million-fold.
