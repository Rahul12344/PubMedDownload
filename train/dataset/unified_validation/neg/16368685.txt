type ib dna topoisomerases found eukarya, two families eukaryotic
viruses (poxviruses mimivirus), many genera bacteria. alter dna
topology cleaving resealing one strand duplex dna via covalent
dna-(3-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate. bacterial type ib enzymes were
discovered recently described poxvirus-like respect their
small size, primary structures, bipartite domain organization. report
the 1.75-a crystal structure deinococcus radiodurans topoisomerase ib
(dratopib), prototype bacterial clade. dratopib consists an
amino-terminal (n) beta-sheet domain (amino acids 1-90) predominantly
alpha-helical carboxyl-terminal (c) domain (amino acids 91-346) closely
resemble corresponding domains vaccinia virus topoisomerase ib. five
amino acids dratopib comprise catalytic pentad (arg-137, lys-174,
arg-239, asn-280, tyr-289) preassembled active site the
absence dna manner nearly identical pentad configuration human 
topoisomerase bound dna. contrasts apoenzyme vaccinia
topoisomerase, three active site constituents either
displaced disordered. n c domains dratopib splayed apart 
"open" conformation, surface catalytic domain containing 
active site exposed dna binding. comparison human topoisomerase
i-dna cocrystal structure suggests viral bacterial topoisomerase ib
enzymes might bind dna circumferentially via movement n domain the
major groove clamping disordered loop c domain around helix.
