single-chain derivatives jrfl gp120 linked first two domains human
cd4 (gp120-cd4d12) cd4 miniprotein analog cd4m9 (gp120-m9), been
constructed. biacore studies revealed gp120-cd4d12 gp120-m9 bound to
antibody 17b dissociation constants 0.8 25 nm, respectively, ph
7.0, gp120 alone bind. binding gp120-cd4d12 17b not
affected addition excess soluble cd4d12, binding gp120-m9 
is enhanced. finding indicates m9 component single chain
interacts relatively weakly gp120 displaced soluble cd4d12.
immunogenicity studies gp120, gp120-cd4d12, gp120-m9 carried with
guinea pigs. three molecules highly immunogenic. resulting antisera 
were examined neutralizing activities various human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 isolates. broadly neutralizing activity observed sera 
generated gp120-cd4d12. antisera depleted anti-cd4d12
antibodies passed column containing immobilized cd4d12. the
depleted sera showed loss broadly neutralizing activity. sera were
affinity purified column containing immobilized gp120-m9 also lacked 
neutralizing activity. finding suggests broadly neutralizing
response observed exclusively due anti-cd4 antibodies. competition
experiments showed antisera generated gp120-cd4d12 competed
with cd4i antibody 17b activity affected depletion
of anti-cd4 antibodies. data indicate although antibodies targeting 
cd4i epitope generated gp120-cd4d12 immunogen, antibodies 
nonneutralizing.
