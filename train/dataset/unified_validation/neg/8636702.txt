an unusual rotavirus strain, mg6, isolated 16-month-old child admitted
to hospital acute gastroenteritis. virus could serotyped
(g-typed) enzyme immunoassay using standard reagents specific common
serotypes human group rotaviruses. nucleotide sequencing cdna derived
from gene encoding outer capsid protein, vp7, deduction vp7
amino acid sequence indicated strain belonged serotype g6, a
serotype normally associated viruses causing disease cattle. was
confirmed polymerase chain reaction typing enzyme immunoassay using a
g6-specific monoclonal antibody. vp4 genotype mg6 determined by
hybridization vp4 cdna genomic rna isolated standard strains of
defined p-types. analysis, confirmed deduced amino acid sequence
analysis, classified mg6 novel genotype p13. mg6, therefore, related 
to previously described g6p13 human strain pa169, isolated italy. the
emergence strain mg6, first human g6 rotavirus identified australia,
provides evidence reassortment human animal rotaviruses.
