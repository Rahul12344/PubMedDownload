although cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(ii) (cisplatin cis-ddp) and
trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(ii) bind dna, cis-ddp widely used 
chemotherapeutic agent; stereoisomer trans-ddp inactive. dna, generally,
is wound around histone core nucleus living cells forms the
nucleosome structure. understand essentially different anticancer
activities cis-ddp trans-ddp, necessary investigate the
interaction cis-ddp (or trans-ddp) dna around histone the
nucleosome. here, used psix174dna-histone(lncap) complexes prepared the
reaction psix174dna histone(lncap) extracted lncap cells. first
show ability cis-ddp dissociate dna from
psix174dna-histone(lncap), nucleosome model, much stronger of
trans-ddp. result action cis-ddp, dna nucleosome is
rendered naked, naked dna vulnerable cis-ddp (or drugs). this
study describes new model showing difference activities of
cis-ddp trans-ddp related difference abilities to
dissociate dna nucleosome.
