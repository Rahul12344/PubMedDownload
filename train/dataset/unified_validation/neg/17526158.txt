the "spanish" influenza pandemic 1918-19 caused acute illness 25-30 percent
of world's population resulted death estimated 40
million people. using fixed frozen lung tissue 1918 influenza victims, the
complete genomic sequence 1918 influenza virus deduced. sequence 
and phylogenetic analysis completed 1918 influenza virus genes shows 
to avian-like among mammalian-adapted viruses. finding
supports hypotheses (1) pandemic virus contains genes derived from
avian-like influenza virus strains (2) 1918 virus common
ancestor human classical swine h1n1 influenza viruses. relationship of
the 1918 virus avian influenza viruses supported recent work
in 1918 hemagglutinin (ha) protein crystal structure resolved.
neither 1918 hemagglutinin (ha) neuraminidase (na) genes possess
mutations known increase tissue tropicity account virulence of
other influenza virus strains like a/wsn/33 highly pathogenic avian
influenza h5 h7 viruses. using reverse genetics approaches, influenza virus
constructs containing 1918 ha na modern human influenza virus
background lethal mice. complete 1918 virus even virulent in
mice. genotypic basis virulence yet elucidated. the
complete sequence non-structural (ns) gene segment 1918 virus was
deduced also tested hypothesis enhanced virulence 1918 could 
have due type interferon inhibition ns1 protein. results from
these experiments suggest human cells 1918 ns1 effective
interferon antagonist, 1918 ns1 gene amino acid change 
that correlates virulence h5n1 virus strains identified 1997 in
hong kong. sequence analysis 1918 pandemic influenza virus allowing us 
to test hypotheses origin virulence strain. this
information help elucidate pandemic influenza virus strains emerge and
what genetic features contribute virulence humans.
