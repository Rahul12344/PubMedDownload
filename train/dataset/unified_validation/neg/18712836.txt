the availability vaccines certain hpv types development of
broad spectrum genotyping methods increased interest co-infections with
different hpv types. present study, prevalence type-specific
composition multiple hpv infections investigated routine cervical
screening population west germany cross-sectional level and
longitudinally. four hundred eighty-nine 8,090 women diagnosed with
multiple hpv infections repeatedly. 7.5-year study period, the
cumulative prevalence hpv co-infections 15.3% contrast the
cross-sectional prevalence 3.8% single visits. overall cumulative
prevalence within cohort women screened 6.9%. using consensus pcr 
with sequencing type-specific pcrs, two three hpv types detected
simultaneously, whereas broad spectrum methods detected seven different
genotypes one sample. nevertheless, common pattern co-infection
occurred two three hpv types irrespective age patient,
cytology histology lesions method used. common
genotypes detected hpv 16, 31, 53, 51, 52, 66, common
pattern co-infection double infection hpv 16 31. results
show rates patterns multiple hpv infections largely dependent 
the methodology used time interval tests. given significance 
of hpv vaccination expected influence immunized populations, is
essential gain additional insights natural course pathogenic
effect multiple hpv infection longitudinally.
