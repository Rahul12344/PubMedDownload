the intra- intercellular transport potexviruses require interactions among
viral rna, coat protein elements triple gene block proteins (tgbps).
in study, requirement bamboo mosaic virus (bamv) tgbps movement
functions compatibilities two potexviruses, potato virus x 
(pvx) foxtail mosaic virus (fomv), examined using satellite
rna-mediated trans-complementation assay system. single multiple tgbps of
bamv, pvx fomv expressed bamv satellite rna (satbamv rna) vectors
to complement functions green fluorescent protein-tagged,
movement-defective bamv mutation(s) matching gene(s). found
that individual bamv tgbps expressed satellite vector could function
normally trans, whereas bi-gene bamv tgbp constructs expression
of tgbp3 might impaired individual tgbp genes pvx fomv could not
complement movement functions defective helper viruses. furthermore,
alterations ratio among tgbps ectopic expression individual
components tgbps satbamv rna vectors affect cell-to-cell
movement capabilities wild-type bamv significantly. results indicate 
species-specific interactions among movement proteins obligatory the
cell-to-cell movement bamv possibly potexviruses.
