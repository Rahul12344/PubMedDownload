respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) principal pathogen causes acute
lower respiratory tract infection (alri) infants. severe rsv-alri been
associated host genetic susceptibility. assess whether severe rsv
disease infants associated certain single nucleotide polymorphism
(snp) gene sp-a1, sp-a2 sp-d, prospective study performed
among blood donors rsv-infected infants aged <or=6 months, considering 
severity, according strict scoring system. allele genotype frequencies
were compared using χ(2)-test. association studies haplotype analysis were
tested using armitagës trend test unphased 3.0 program. total 118
rsv-infected infants 104 blood donors enrolled study; 59
infants severe respiratory disease, 34 children developed moderate
illness 25 mild disease. difference allelic and
genotypic frequencies sp-a1, intragenic haplotypes showed significant
differences among infected infants blood donors (p=0.0021). 1a(0) variant 
sp-a2 frequent allele groups. thr(11) allele sp-d is
significantly higher rsv infants (p=0.028), given higher frequency
in severe disease (p=0.046). heterozygous thr(11)/met(11) significantly 
common infected infants (p=0.037), higher frequency in
critically ill children (p=0.017). thr(160) allele significantly higher in
severe infants compared blood donors (p=0.046) infants mild disease
(p=0.018). thr(11)-thr(160)-ser(270) haplotype significantly common in
rsv-infants, due severe (p=0.00000034) moderate disease (p=0.000009).
differences also found among severe mild disease (p=0.026). differences 
found authors, indicate need local studies identify genetic
biomarkers severity.
