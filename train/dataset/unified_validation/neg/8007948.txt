the type ii scavenger receptors (srs) highly restricted cells of
monocyte origin become maximally expressed process of
monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. report, present evidence 
sr genomic sequences -245 +46 bp relative major transcriptional
start site sufficient confer preferential expression reporter gene
to cells monocyte macrophage origin. profile expression resulted
from combinatorial actions multiple positive negative regulatory
elements. positive transcriptional control primarily determined two
elements, located 181 46 bp upstream major transcriptional start site.
transcriptional control via -181 element mediated pu.1/spi-1, a
macrophage b-cell-specific transcription factor member ets
domain gene family. intriguingly, -181 element represented relatively
low-affinity binding site spi-b, closely related member ets domain
family shown bind relatively high affinity other
pu.1/spi-1 binding sites. observations support idea pu.1/spi-1 and
spi-b regulate overlapping nonidentical sets genes. -46 element
represented composite binding site distinct set ets domain proteins
that preferentially expressed monocyte macrophage cell lines that
formed ternary complexes members ap-1 gene family. concert, 
observations suggest model interactions cell-specific 
generally expressed transcription factors function dictate appropriate
temporal cell-specific patterns sr expression process of
macrophage differentiation.
