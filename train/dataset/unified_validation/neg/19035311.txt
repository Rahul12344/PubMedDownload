background: explored gene-therapeutic approach stimulate antitumor
immunity adenoviral-mediated transfer cd40 ligand (cd40l) treat
metastatic liver cancer rat model.
materials methods: rat metastatic liver cancer cells implanted 
back rats bilaterally. larger tumor reached 8.0 mm diameter,
adenovirus vector-expressing mouse cd40l injected intratumorally treatment
group (n=5), lacz injected control group (n=5).
results: control group, tumor gradually grew 20.7+/-1.6
(mean+/-sd) mm intratumorally injected tumors 21.8+/-3.7 mm opposite
tumors seven weeks injection, respectively. contrast, treatment
group, tumor reduced 3.6+/-8.2 mm 3.7+/-8.2 mm. tumor growth
and survival rate significantly different (p<0.001).
conclusion: adenovirus vector-mediated cd40l gene therapy effective
therapeutic method metastatic liver cancer.
