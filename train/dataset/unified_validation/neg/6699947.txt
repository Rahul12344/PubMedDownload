experiments exploring reasons multiplicity products early
region 1a adenovirus 5 described. labeled early region 1a products from
wild-type virus synthesized infected cells cell-free system
programmed mrna infected cells, immunoprecipitated specifically an
antipeptide serum, e1a-c1, directed c-terminal sequence e1a
products, separated gel electrophoresis. two-dimensional maps of
[35s]methionine-labeled peptides consistent antigens 52,000 daltons 
(52k) 48.5k 13s mrna antigens 50k, 45k, 35k from
the 12s mrna. partial n-terminal sequences 52k, 50k, 48.5k, 45k
synthesized vitro showed antigens initiated the
predicted atg nucleotide 560 dna sequence. results eliminate
multiple initiation sites proteolytic cleavage n-terminal end as
sources antigen diversity. peptide maps n-terminal sequences obtained
in similar way e1a products ad5 deletion mutant dl1504, which
lacks normal initiator codon. predicted, polypeptides initiated 
at next atg, 15 codons downstream wild-type sequence. results
are discussed relation kozak's ribosomal scanning model.
