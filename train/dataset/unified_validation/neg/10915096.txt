several studies patients infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) type
1 suggested women lower plasma hiv-1 rna levels men, even
when controlling cd4 cell levels. cross-sectional analysis performed 
in 494 patients (21% women) enrolled prospective study of
anemic hiv-1-infected patients requiring transfusion. median cd4 cell count
and plasma hiv-1 rna levels 15 cells/microl 4.83 log(10) copies/ml
(67,350 copies/ml), respectively. unadjusted analyses, women slightly
higher mean log hiv-1 rna titers men (0.19 log(10) higher copies/ml; 95%
confidence interval, -0.05 0.44; p=.11). adjustment cd4 cell count, race
or ethnicity, injection drug use, age yielded smaller sex difference (0.13 
log(10) copies/ml higher women; p=.28). population patients with
very advanced hiv disease, evidence women lower hiv-1 rna
levels men.
