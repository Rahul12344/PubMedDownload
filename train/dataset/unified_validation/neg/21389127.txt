respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection cultured cell lines causes
cell-cell fusion death. cell fusion caused fusion (f) glycoprotein 
and clearly cytopathic, aspects rsv infection may also contribute
to cytopathology. investigate possibility, generated rsv replicon
that lacks three glycoprotein genes cannot cause cell-cell
fusion virus spread. replicon includes green fluorescent protein gene
and antibiotic resistance gene enable detection selection of
replicon-containing cells. adaptive mutations rsv replicon not
required replicon maintenance. cells containing replicon could cloned 
and passaged many times absence antibiotic selection, 99% 
of cells retaining replicon cell division. transient
expression f g (attachment) glycoproteins supported production 
virions could transfer replicon cell lines tested. since the
rsv replicon toxic cultured cells affect rate 
of cell division, none 8 internal viral proteins, viral rna

cytopathic. however, level replicon genome gene expression is
controlled manner well complete virus and, such, might
avoid cytotoxicity. rsv replicons could useful cytoplasmic gene expression
