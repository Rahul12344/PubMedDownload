background aims: although insulin resistance affects liver fibrosis
progression treatment response chronic hepatitis c (chc), relationship
between chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection insulin resistance (ir)
remains firmly established. thus studied impact host, metabolic
and viral factors ir chc patients.
methods: total 162 chc patients complete clinical data enrolled.
among them, 94 received histological examinations. quantitative hcv rna was
assayed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. genotyping was
performed reverse transcription pcr type-specific primers. the
pretreatment ir index determined using homeostasis model assessment (homa),
and index value 2.4 designated ir. unadjusted adjusted
association hcv rna level ir analysed.
results: multivariate linear regression analysis, dose-response relationship
was observed log(10) hcv rna level presence ir. ir was
positively correlated body mass index, triglyceride, hcv rna alanine
aminotransferase levels, negatively correlated adiponectin level.
subgroup analysis stratified hcv genotype showed trend
towards higher homr-ir index value lower adiponectin levels genotype 1
patients. histological analysis showed ir positively associated the
severity hepatic steatosis.
conclusions: data indicate higher hcv rna levels associated the
presence ir chc patients. studies needed clarify the
interplays hcv infection, ir adiponectin attempt develop new
adjuvant therapy chc.
