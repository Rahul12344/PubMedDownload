many studies tried identify genetic markers infectious diseases, some
of focused human leukocyte antigens (hla). products hla genes
interact surface-specific receptors lymphocytes, resulting in
activation host's immune response. association bacterial, viral,
parasitic fungal infections host's hla widely investigated.
the type strength association differs among distinct populations, 
well among racial and/or ethnic groups. new molecular methods the
identification hla alleles, resulting new nomenclature, have
contributed better understanding system. unfortunately, this
information adequately transmitted clinicians, hampers 
understanding association hla system diseases. revised 
relevant studies association hla genes infectious diseases,
demonstrating importance pathogenic mechanisms, increased
susceptibility protection infections complications.
