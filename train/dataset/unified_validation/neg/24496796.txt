herpes simplex virus (hsv) utilizes subverts host chromatin mechanisms to
express lytic gene products mammalian cells. host cell attempts to
silence incoming viral genome epigenetic mechanisms, viral vp16
and icp0 proteins promote active chromatin viral genome recruiting
other host epigenetic factors. however, dependence vp16 icp0 differs
in different cell lines, implying cell type-dependent functional contributions of
epigenetic factors hsv gene expression. study, performed a
targeted rna interference (rnai) screen cellular chromatin factors are
involved regulation herpes simplex virus (hsv) gene expression u2os
osteosarcoma cells, cell line complements icp0 mutant vp16 mutant
virus replication. screen, found general classes chromatin
factors regulate hsv gene expression u2os cells cell types,
including histone demethylases (hdms), histone deacetylases (hdacs), histone
acetyltransferases (hats), chromatin-remodeling factors, specific
factors within classes different identified previously for
other cell types. example, kdm3a kdm1a (lsd1) demethylate mono- 
dimethylated h3k9, kdm3a emerged screen u2os cells. further, small 
interfering rna (sirna) inhibitor studies support idea kdm1a more
critical hela cells, observed previously, kdm3a critical in
u2os cells. results argue different cellular chromatin factors are
critical different cell lines carry positive negative
epigenetic effects exerted hsv genome.importance: upon entry host
cell nucleus, herpes simplex virus genome subjected host epigenetic
silencing mechanisms. viral proteins recruit cellular epigenetic activator
proteins reverse counter cellular silencing mechanisms. the
host silencing activator functions involved hsv gene expression 
identified, indications host cell factors may vary
in different cell types. study, performed screen chromatin
factors involved hsv gene regulation osteosarcoma cells, found 
the chromatin factors critical hsv gene expression cells
are different previously studied cell types. results argue
that specific chromatin factors operative different cell lines cell
types may differ. implications epigenetic drugs under
development.
