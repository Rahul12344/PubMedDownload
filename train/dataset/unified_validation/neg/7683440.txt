the present study describes 7 amino acid-long sequence (yqqqgrl) is
identical hla-associated invariant chain mumps virus nucleocapsid protein 
and additionally followed one conservative amino acid pair. long 
amino acid homology extremely rare two evolutionarily unrelated proteins
the possibility could induce immunological cross-reactivity was
evaluated. several antigenicity indices suggested high antigen potential within
this region. synthetic peptides containing sequence reactive 31%
of monoclonal antibodies specific mumps virus nucleocapsid protein elisa. 
high antibody levels epitope found 7% mumps-seropositive 
human sera antibody levels clearly increased natural mumps infections
and mumps vaccinations. rabbit antibodies raised synthetic invariant
chain peptide ayf-lyqqqgrldkl-c reacted corresponding nucleocapsid peptide
rfakyqqqgrlear-c antibodies nucleocapsid peptide reacted the
invariant chain peptide. rabbit antibodies invariant chain peptide
also reacted nucleocapsid molecules formaldehyde-fixed mumps
virus-infected cells, antibodies nucleocapsid peptide reacted
with invariant chains expressed methanol-fixed cells. one monoclonal antibody 
specific nucleocapsid molecule also reacted cells expressing
invariant chains. immunoprecipitation rabbit antibodies invariant 
chain peptide bound invariant chains antibodies nucleocapsid
peptide not. results suggest antigenic similarity mumps 
virus nucleocapsid molecule hla-associated invariant chain may cause
immunological cross-reactivity molecules.
