usutu virus mosquito-borne virus first isolated culex naevei south
africa 1959. first emergence usutu virus outside africa recorded in
austria. here, phylogenetic analysis targeting e5 ns5 genes carried
out viral strains circulating europe. ns5 gene tree showed two main
clades, one included italian sequences. e gene tree all
sequences grouped main clade, sequences austria divided
into two separate clusters. sites negative selective pressure were
found e ns5 proteins. results suggest usutu virus circulating 
europe degree genetic diversity higher expected infection 
may arise different sources.
