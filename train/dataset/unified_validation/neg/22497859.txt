honey bee (apis mellifera) larvae reared vitro exposed one nine
pesticides and/or challenged parasitic mite, varroa destructor.
total rna extracted individual larvae first strand cdnas were
generated. gene-expression changes larvae measured using quantitative pcr
(qpcr) targeting transcripts pathogens genes involved physiological
processes, bee health, immunity, and/or xenobiotic detoxification. transcript
levels peptidoglycan recognition protein (pgrpsc), pathogen recognition
gene, increased larvae exposed varroa mites (p<0.001) changed 
in pesticide treated larvae. expected, varroa-parasitized brood higher
transcripts deformed wing virus control larvae (p<0.001). varroa
parasitism, arguably coupled virus infection, resulted significantly
higher transcript abundances antimicrobial peptides abaecin,
hymenoptaecin, defensin1. transcript levels prophenoloxidase-activating
enzyme (ppoact), immune end product, elevated larvae treated with
myclobutanil chlorothalonil (both fungicides) (p<0.001). transcript
levels hexameric storage protein (hsp70) significantly upregulated in
imidacloprid, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, amitraz treated larvae.
definitive impacts pesticides varroa parasitism honey bee larval gene
expression demonstrated. interactions larval treatments gene
expression targeted genes discussed.
