human adenovirus early region 1a (e1a) proteins act transcriptional regulators
and function control dna synthesis cell transformation. little is
known viral products functionally regulated. e1a proteins 
adenovirus serotype 5 (ad5) phosphorylated several serine residues and
previous studies indicated ser-89 ser-219 substrates for
one cdc2 family cell cycle kinases. second residue near the
amino terminus, ser-96, may also site. although phosphorylation ser-89
causes major shift gel mobility, effect e1a biological activity is
unclear. present studies shown mutational analysis that
phosphorylation ser-89 also regulates phosphorylation ser-96, suggesting
that gel mobility shift result multiple phosphorylation events.
phosphorylation ser-89 seem affect e1a-mediated repression the
simian virus 40 enhancer trans-activation e3 promoter significantly,
but appear modest significant effect transformation of
primary baby rat kidney cells.
