a patient chronic hepatitis type c, confirmed detection hepatitis 
c virus rna (hcv rna) serum histological examination liver
biopsy specimen, treated four courses interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha).
for first three courses ifn-alpha patient's serum alanine
aminotransferase (alt) level normalized administration ifn-alpha
but rose cessation; similarly, hcv rna absent serum 
by end course treatment could detected after
treatment stopped. fourth course ifn-alpha therapy, however, produced a
sustained normalization alt level sustained absence hcv rna from
the serum 20 months end treatment. case suggests that
patients potential eventual complete response ifn-alpha
therapy may show normalization serum alt levels ifn-alpha
administration absence hcv rna serum end course 
of treatment (even particular course treatment produce a
sustained response).
