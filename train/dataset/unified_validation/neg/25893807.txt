the aim study understand association human papillomavirus
(hpv) type 16/18 infection polymorphisms hla-dqb1 (rs6457617) and
il-1β -511 (rs16944) loci development uterine cervical cancer (cacx).
the distribution hla-dqb1 g > il-1β -511 c/t polymorphisms was
determined hpv-negative cervical swabs normal women (n = 111) and
compared cervical swabs hpv-cleared normal women (once hpv infected
followed natural clearance infection, n = 86), hpv16/18-positive
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin, n = 41) cacx biopsies (n = 107). the
a-allele containing genotypes (i.e. g/a a/a) hla-dqb1 significantly
associated cacx compared hpv-negative [or = 2.56(1.42-4.62), p = 0.001]
or hpv-cleared [or = 2.07(1.12-3.87), p = 0.01] normal women, whereas the
t-allele containing genotypes (i.e. c/t t/t) il-1β showed increased risk
of cin [or = 3.68(0.97-16.35), p = 0.03; = 3.59(0.92-16.38), p = 0.03] and
cacx development [or = 2.03(1.03-5.2), p = 0.02; = 2.25(0.96-5.31), p = 0.04] 
compared hpv-negative hpv-cleared normal women. considering two
loci together, evident t- a-alleles rendered significantly
increased susceptibility development cin cacx compared with
hpv-negative hpv-cleared normal women. moreover, t-allele il-1β showed
increased susceptibility cin [or = 3.62(0.85-17.95), p = 0.04] cacx [or =
2.39(0.91-6.37), p = 0.05] development compared hpv-cleared women, even 
in presence hla-dqb1 g-allele. thus, data suggest persistent 
hpv16/18 infection cervix due presence hla-dqb1 a-allele and
chronic inflammation due presence il-1β -511 t-allele might
predispose women cacx development.
