we earlier described alternative mhc class processing pathway for
sendai virus (sv) h-2kb-transfected t2 cells (t2kb). cells deleted 
genes transporters associated ag processing (tap1/2) proteasome
subunits lmp2/7 still process sv presentation an
immunodominant nucleoprotein ctl epitope (nucleoprotein peptide 324-332,
fapgnypal, sv9), even presence fungal metabolite brefeldin (bfa).
presently compared live heat-inactivated sv investigate whether
infectious virus, including early events binding fusion host
cell membrane, important nonclassical mhc class processing and
immunogenicity. found heated virus (56 degrees c, boiled or
autoclaved) fusion hemagglutinin-neuraminidase activities, behaves
similar live sv t2kb cells entering tap-independent bfa-resistant 
pathway. el-4 cells, express nonclassical tap-independent
and bfa-resistant pathway, heat-treated sv processed bfa-sensitive way.
in t1kb- tap1/2-transfected t2kb cells, t2kb cells, processing of
heat-inactivated sv completely bfa resistant. heat-inactivated sv also
found prime ctls vivo. conclude heat-inactivated sv enter 
bfa-sensitive -resistant mhc class processing pathways sv 
respect may particularly efficient. property sv important 
for characteristic presently clear might useful the
deliberate generation ctl responses vivo.
