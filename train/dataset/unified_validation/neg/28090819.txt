toxoplasmic encephalitis (te) caused toxoplasma gondii infection be
a life-threatening disease immunocompromised patients. study evaluated
the rate relapse associated pyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy (i.e.
secondary prophylaxis) patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) or
aids treated prior common use (i.e. 1996) highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart) (pre-haart post-haart, respectively). pubmed, 
google scholar, cochrane databases searched 6 june 2016 using search 
terms: pyrimethamine, daraprim, fansidar, metakelfin, fansimef,
5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-ethyl-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, encephalitis, cerebral,
toxoplasmosis, toxoplasmic, gondii. single-arm cohort, retrospective, and
randomized studies included. twenty-six studies 1,596 patients were
included analysis; twenty pre-haart (n = 1,228) studies six post-haart
(n = 368) performed. pooled proportions test pyrimethamine-based therapy
from pre-haart studies indicated relapse rate 19.2% 18.9% the
fixed-effects random-effects models, respectively. relapse rate the
post-haart studies 11.1% (fixed random effects). continuous therapy was
suggestive lower incidence relapse compared intermittent therapy in
the pre-haart era (range, 18.7 17.3% vs. 20.9 25.6%, respectively). these
findings indicate likelihood relapse associated with
pyrimethamine-based therepy patients hiv te decreased the
introduction haart approximately 11%. findings important
implications relapse may affect patient's disease severity prognosis,
increase utilization health care resources, result additional health
care expenditure.
