ce family electrokinetic separation techniques separate compounds
based upon differences electrophoretic mobilities, phase partitioning, pi,
molecular size, combination one several properties. ce has
been used several modes analyze characterize wide variety analytes
from simple inorganic ions, small organic molecules, peptides, proteins, nucleic 
acids virus, microbes particles. food consists complex mixture a
variety components, many biologically active. components
classified "nutrients" essential growth, maintenance, repair of
the body. food constituents, typically occurring small quantities, are
classified "biologically active substances" beneficial or
harmful effects human health. two types biologically active
substances food - naturally occurring food additives. bioactive
compounds food mentioned review inorganic organic
acids, amino acids, vitamins, phenolic compounds, biogenic amines, antinutrients,
toxins, etc. review focused application ce with
hydrodynamically closed system (suppression eof) analysis the
above-mentioned compounds. ce alternative method hplc other
methods analysis bioactive compounds food. main advantages ce
are low running cost (at least ten times hplc) consideration to
environment (hundreds microliters diluted water based electrolyte per
analysis).
