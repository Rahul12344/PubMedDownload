background colorectal cancer (crc) third common cancer worldwide,
making serious threat human health. imperative develop new
therapeutics improve crc treatment efficiency. aim study was
to investigate role nprl2 improving sensitivity cpt-11 colon
cancer cells. material methods nprl2 overexpression established by
transfecting recombinant lentivirus-encoding nprl2 gene hct116 colon
cancer cells. cell proliferation identified using cell counting kit-8 (cck8) 
assay. cell cycle apoptosis examined flow cytometry. an
immunofluorescence staining assay conducted examine expression of
Î³-h2ax. wound-healing transwell assays utilized show cell migration
and invasion capability. expression apoptosis-related proteins (cleaved
caspase-3, caspase-9, cleaved parp, bax, bcl-2), invasion-related proteins
(mmp2, mmp9, p-pi3k, p-akt), dna damage checkpoint pathway proteins
(p-atm, p-chk2, cdc25c, cdc2, cyclin b1) quantified western blotting.
results cck8 assay revealed overexpression nprl2 improved the
sensitivity cpt-11 hct116 cells (p<0.05). functionally, nprl2
overexpression elevated sensitivity cpt-11 preventing colon cancer cell
proliferation, cell movement, invasion, promoting cell apoptosis g2/m
cell cycle arrest. mechanistically, nprl2 overexpression enhanced cpt-11
sensitivity activating dna damage checkpoint pathway. conclusions nprl2
overexpression enhances sensitivity cpt-11 treatment colon cancer cells,
and may serve molecular therapeutic agent treat patients crc.
