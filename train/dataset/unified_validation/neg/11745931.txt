the sustained response interferon-alpha treatment evaluated 147
anti-hcv/hcv-rna-positive, hbsag-negative, chronic hepatitis patients, according 
to hcv genotypes presence absence anti-hbs anti-hbc. these
patients included controlled study safety, tolerability, and
efficacy three types interferon-alpha given dose 3 mu three times
weekly 52 weeks. one hundred two patients hcv genotype 1, 42 non-1 
hcv genotype 3 multiple hcv genotypes; 46 anti-hbs anti-hbc negative
(group a), 50 anti-hbs anti-hbc positive (group b), 51 anti-hbs negative 
and anti-hbc positive ("isolated" anti-hbc, group c). serum hbv-dna detected 
by polymerase chain reaction 15 51 (29.4%) patients group c in
none groups b. sustained response rate higher in
patients non-1 hcv genotype hcv genotype 1 (31% vs. 17.7%,
p > 0.1). fewer patients group c showed sustained response group a
or group b (7.8% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.009 7.8% vs 28%, p = 0.017, respectively). 
moreover, sustained response rate high patients non-1 genotype,
both group (42.8%) group b (42.8%), intermediate patients hcv
genotype 1 (23.3% group 22.2% group b) low group c,
irrespective hcv genotype (8.3% genotype 1 7.1% genotypes). 
the data indicate patients hcv chronic hepatitis isolated anti-hbc 
show poor response ifn-alpha, irrespective hcv genotype.
