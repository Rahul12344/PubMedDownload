conventional cancer treatments often hampered lack tumour
selectivity, resulting toxicity healthy tissue. gene-directed enzyme
prodrug therapy (gdept) suicide gene therapy approach aims improve
the selectivity chemotherapy enabling cancer cells convert non-cytotoxic
prodrugs cytotoxic drugs. many enzyme/prodrug systems described,
some already tested clinical trials. key component of
gdept foreign enzyme expressed selectively tumour site 
it converts prodrug cytotoxic agent. gene encoding the
prodrug-activating enzyme needs expressed selectively efficiently in
tumour cells order spare normal tissue damage. substantial efforts
have made develop gene therapy vectors capable targeting
cancer cells. large number gene delivery systems described for
gdept: viral vectors advanced. include replication-deficient
and replication-selective (oncolytic) viruses. recent advances engineering
viruses gdept reviewed article data preclinical
studies clinical trials discussed.
