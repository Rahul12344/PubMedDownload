the production characterization two mouse monoclonal antibodies (mabs)
raised human basic protein p2 described. two mabs recognise two
non-overlapping epitopes p2. using two mabs probe, search was
made presence anti-idiotype (ab2) antibodies directed anti-p2 
(ab1) autoantibodies sera patients guillain-barré syndrome (gbs). in
sera twenty gbs patients ab2 antibodies could demonstrated.
epitopes present cytomegalo virus- epstein-barr virus-infected cells, which
may play part triggering gbs, recognised two mabs.
