specific human papilloma virus (hpv) types appear necessary etiological
factors cervical cancers, yet additional genetic alterations seem 
required development progression. aim study to
determine likely chromosomes location tumorigenicity suppressor-like
genes, loss function might important origin or
progression cervical carcinomas. pcr primers 75 highly polymorphic
microsatellite loci located major autosome arms used estimate 
incidence loss heterozygosity (loh) 38 tumors. hpv status the
tumors also determined. loh found involve 19 chromosome arms 20-43%
of tumors. chromosome arms 6p, 3p, 18q frequently involved in
loh 43, 39, 35% informative carcinomas, respectively. the
respective regions involved 6p21.1-23, 3p13-25.3, 18q12.2-21.2. loh is
generally limited specific band segments within regions. similar high
incidences loh 3p segments reported cervical
carcinomas different parts world. 3p 6p segments are
involved many types common cancers, whereas 18q changes less frequent
in cancers. chromosome arms 1q, 2q, 3q, 4p, 4q, 5p, 5q, 6q, 7q, 8p, 8q,
11q, 13q, 16p, 18p, 19p involved loh 20-33% cervical tumors.
chromosome 11 alterations among frequently found many different
types neoplasias. study, 11p involved 16% tumors, and
11q involved 22%. chromosome 17 alterations found cancers than
those chromosome, frequently involving p53 gene 17p. loh of
17p found 5 (15%) cervical tumors; 2 hpv negative and
expressed mutant p53. hpv-negative tumors, direct mutation the
wild-type p53 appears replace inactivation p53 product oncogenic
hpv types. tumors loh many loci were, average, advanced
stages, tumors mutant p53. higher overall incidence loh in
cervical carcinomas compared cancers, diversity loh
patterns found, suggest different cervical carcinomas probably arise and/or 
progress, part, loss function different yet finite sets
of tumorigenicity suppressor genes genes involved tumor
progression metastasis. findings also indicate certain chromosome
segments often altered cervical carcinomas also frequently
altered several types cancers. remains determined whether
the different genes located within segments involved the
different cancer types.
