objective: developing rapid method detect influenza virus n2 subtype by
fluorescence real-time quantitative rt-pcr.
methods: according conservative sequences na gene influenza virus n2
subtype, pair primers taq-man probe designed, respectively. using one 
step rt-pcr kit set real-time rt-pcr system detection influenza
virus n2 subtype, standard quantitative curve assay was
established using 10-fold serial dilution tcid50, sensitivity was
determined. specificity test influenza virus illness (ili) samples
were also determined using rt-pcr system.
results: sensitivity detection influenza virus n2 subtype 2.56 x
10(-6) regression coefficient quantitative curve 0.997. the
amplification efficiency specificity assay 99.9% 100%,
respectively. real-time rt-pcr n2 subtype results ili samples in
accordance hai method completely.
conclusion: detection system based real-time rt-pcr could utilized to
rapidly sensitively detect influenza virus n2 subtype.
