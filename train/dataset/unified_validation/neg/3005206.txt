to obtain definitive evidence milk-borne infection plays critical role 
the endemy mother-to-child transmission human t-cell leukemia virus type-i 
(htlv-i), inoculated concentrated fresh human milk cells obtained htlv-i 
carrier mothers oral cavity common marmoset (callithrix jacchus).
twenty-eight milk samples collected (5-10 ml each) 17 carrier mothers
in first week delivery. cells milk centrifuged and
resuspended 1/10 vol milk fluid. concentrated cell suspensions were
successively inoculated oral cavity common marmoset. marmoset
was found seroconverted indirect immunofluorescence assay 2.5 months 
after first inoculation milk (3.5 x 10(8) cells total), was
later confirmed infected htlv-i detection viral antigen
expression short-term cultures peripheral blood t-lymphocytes. the
results strongly support working hypothesis milk-borne infection plays a
significant role mother-to-child transmission htlv-i.
