progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: investigation three cases using in
situ hybridization jc virus biotinylated dna probe.

aksamit aj, mourrain p, sever jl, major eo.

using technique situ dna-to-dna hybridization, jc virus biotinylated 
dna probe developed applied formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, or
fixed, frozen sections brain tissue three subjects progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). light microscopy carried to
correlate presence jc virus dna selective infection of
oligodendrocytes astrocytes pml. oligodendrocytes (lytically infected)
showed greatest evidence viral dna. astrocytes showing bizarre
morphological changes evidence viral dna astrocytes were
simply reactive. viral dna evident vascular endothelial cells using
this technique. viral dna replication may important initial step which
produces bizarre "transformed" astrocytes pml. findings study do
not support hypothesis vascular endothelial replication important 
the pathogenesis jc virus-induced pml. situ hybridization biotinylated
jc virus probe may useful diagnosis pml brain biopsy specimens.
