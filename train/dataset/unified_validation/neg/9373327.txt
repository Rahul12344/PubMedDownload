background: considerable interest specific targeting of
therapeutic agents cancer cells. particular promise technique known as
antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (adept). approach enzyme is
targeted tumour conjugation tumour specific-antibody tumour.
after allowing sufficient time conjugate localise tumour and
clear circulatory system, relatively non-toxic prodrug is
administered. prodrug converted highly cytotoxic drug action 
of targeted enzyme localised tumour site.
objectives: construct gene fusions pseudomonad carboxypeptidase g2
(cpg2) gene dna encoding mfe-23 (an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (cea)
single-chain fv (scfv) molecule), derived phage display library. to
overexpress resultant gene fusions escherichia coli, assess in
vitro vivo properties purified fusion proteins.
study design: introduce unique cloning restriction sites 5'-end of
the cpg2 gene site-directed mutagenesis facilitate fusion 3'-end 
the gene encoding mfe-23 (constructs without flexible (gly4ser)3
linker-encoding sequence designed). overexpress resultant gene
fusions transcriptional control lac promoter direct the
fusion proteins produced periplasmic space e. coli through
translational coupling pelb signal peptide.
results: biologically active recombinant cpg2::mfe-23 scfv fusion proteins were
produced e. coli shown possess enzyme anti-cea activity. affinity
chromatography followed size exclusion gel filtration yielded approximately
0.7-1.4 mg/l shake flask culture. fusion protein enzyme and
antibody moieties joined linker peptide shown effectively
localised nude mice bearing human colon tumour xenografts, giving favourable
tumour blood ratios.
conclusion: mfe-23 scfv serves ideal candidate antibody arm a
bacterially expressed fusion protein cpg2. biological properties this
recombinant protein suggest may employed tumour specific prodrug
activation. however, assessment stability pharmokinetics is
required genetic fusion considered alternative chemical
conjugation.
