huntington's disease (hd) affects neurons astrocytes. target the
latter ensure brain-wide transgene expression, adeno-associated viral
(aav) vectors administered intravenously, aav vectors cross the
blood-brain barrier (bbb) enable preferential transduction astrocytes due 
to close association blood vessels. however, possibility
that subclass gfap-expressing astrocytes performs distinct role hd
and reacts differently therapeutic measures rest astrocytes.
the gfaabc1d promoter allows specific targeting gfap-expressing astrocytes
(~25% s100β-expressing astrocytes). examined expression three
different transgenes (gcamp6f, kir4.1 glt1) tested effects aav
serotypes 9 rh8. aav vectors injected tail vein of
1-year-old homozygous z-q175-ki hd mice wild-type (wt) littermates. 
this age, hd mice exhibit motor symptoms, including pronounced hypokinesia and
circling behaviour. expression times ranged 3 6weeks. target cell
population defined cells expressing s100β addition gfap.

(aav9-gfaabc1d-glt1-tomato) tested first time. glt1, principal
astrocytic glutamate transporter, deficient hd therefore considered 
a potential target gene therapy. dose 1.86×1011 vector genome (vg)
