chronic hepatitis c major cause liver cirrhosis leading chronic liver 
failure hepatocellular carcinoma. different hepatitis c virus (hcv) proteins 
have associated resistance interferon-alpha-based therapy. however, 
the exact mechanisms virus-mediated interferon resistance completely
understood. importance amino acid (aa) variations within hcv

the therapy unknown. investigated pretreatment sera 42 patients with
known outcome interferon-based therapy. complete ns4b gene amplified
and sequenced. mutational analyses predicted conformational, functional,
structural phylogenetic properties deduced aa sequences were
performed. complete ns4b protein highly conserved median frequency
of 0.015 +/- 0.009 aa exchanges (median +/- sd, 4.00 +/- 2.31). especially within
the predicted transmembranous domains ns4b protein, mean number aa 
variations low (median frequency, 0.013 +/- 0.013). neither number aa 
variations specific aa exchanges correlated hcv rna serum

frequency nonconservative aa exchanges within complete ns4b protein in
comparison patients nonrapid hcv rna decline (median frequency, 0.011
+/- 0.005 vs 0.004 +/- 0.003, p = 0.006). overall, aa sequence ns4b
protein highly conserved, indicating important role replication in
vivo. amino acid variations relevant changes physicochemical properties
may influence replication efficiency, associated rapid early virological
response.
