abstract virus isolated hot pepper (capsicum annuum cv. hyang chon)
growing korea displaying necrotic spots streaks leaves stems
followed stunting death plants. morphological host range analyses
of extracts infected plants suggested causal agent disease a
broad bean wilt virus (bbwv), virus tentatively named korean
isolate bbwv (bbwv-k). isolate back-inoculated onto hot pepper
plants, induced symptoms similar naturally infected hot pepper 
the field. two coat proteins (cps) 44 22 kda, corresponding large cp 
and small cp, respectively, identified virus, reacted
specifically polyclonal antibody bbwv 2. complete nucleotide
sequences rna 1 rna 2 isolate determined cdna clones. the
deduced amino acid sequence data putative proteins encoded rna 1 
2 bbwv-k indicated closer relationship isolates bbwv 2 
bbwv 1. however, sequence comparison 5' noncoding regions viruses
differentiates bbwv-k bbwv 2 isolates. another distinctive feature 
the bbwv-k generates defective rnas hot pepper exhibiting necrotic 
symptoms, first report defective rnas fabavirus genera 
bbwvs.
