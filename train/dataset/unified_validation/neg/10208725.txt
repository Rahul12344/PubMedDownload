to determine efficacy clean-in-place system inactivation of
viruses present human plasma, effect 0.1 sodium hydroxide 60
degrees c viral infectivity investigated. inactivation following
model relevant viruses followed function time: human hepatitis a
virus (hav), canine parvovirus (cpv; model human parvovirus b-19)
pseudorabies virus (prv, model hepatitis b virus), bovine viral
diarrhoea virus (bvdv, model hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency
virus). infectivity cpv determined novel situ eia method which
will prove useful studies validate parvovirus inactivation removal.
infectivity bvdv, prv cpv shown reproducibly inactivated 
the limit detection 0.1 naoh 60 degrees c within 30 s. hav was
inactivated limit detection within 2 min. treatment heat
alone also resulted log reduction viruses tested except cpv
which remained unaffected heating 60 degrees c 16 min. treatment 
hav hydroxide alone (up 1.0 m) 15 degrees c lead rapid
inactivation. collectively, data suggest 0.1 naoh 60 degrees c
for two min sufficient inactivate viruses present process
residues.
