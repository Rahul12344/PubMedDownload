real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) complementary dna is
now standard method studies gene expression. however, qpcr identify 
genuine variation transcript quantities accurately normalized an
appropriate reference. identify reliable reference genes for
transcript quantification qpcr, describe systematic evaluation of
candidate reference genes arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia-0 (col-0).
twelve genes selected transcript stability studies qpcr of
complementary dna prepared arabidopsis leaf tissue infected one five
plant viruses (cauliflower mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, tomato spotted
wilt virus, turnip mosaic virus, turnip yellow mosaic virus). f-box
family protein, elongation factor 1-Î±, sand family protein, protodermal
factor 2 gene transcripts showed stable accumulation, whereas a
traditionally used reference gene, actin8, showed least stable accumulation
as measured genorm algorithm. data furnish plant virologists with
reference genes normalization qpcr-derived gene expression in
virus-infected arabidopsis beneficial selection design 
primers targeting orthologous genes plant species.
