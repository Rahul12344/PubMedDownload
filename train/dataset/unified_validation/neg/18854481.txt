summary: unique life cycle adeno-associated virus (aav) ability to
infect nondividing dividing cells persistent expression made
it attractive vector. additional attractive feature wild-type virus 
is lack apparent pathogenicity. gene transfer studies using aav shown
significant progress level animal models; clinical trials been
noteworthy respect safety aav vectors. proven efficacy been
observed, although instances, promising observations. 
this review, topics aav biology supplemented section aav
clinical trials emphasis need deeper understanding aav
biology development efficient aav vectors. addition, several novel 
approaches recent findings promise expand aav's utility are
discussed, especially context combining gene therapy ex vivo new
advances stem progenitor cell biology.
