dengue fever mosquito-borne viral disease dramatically increasing
morbidity rate worldwide decades. since specific treatment to
date, early diagnosis important providing proper timely medical care to
minimize mortality, prompt initiation public health control
measures. ns5 potential biomarker dengue virus infection due its
highly conserved immunogenic properties. study, denv 2 ns5
full-length denv 2 ns5 c-terminus rna-dependent rna polymerase domain
fragment (ns5-c70) expression plasmids constructed, 104 kda
full-length ns5 70 kda ns5-c70 respectively expressed escherichia
coli. two purified recombinant products found react sera
of patients infected dengue virus analyzed enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa), resulted significantly higher absorption
values control sera. recombinant denv 2 ns5 exhibited strong
reactivity four types sera, whereas ns5-c70 showed strong
reactivity denv 2 4. comparison, positive agreement value of
recombinant ns5-based assay either mybiosource panbio assay higher
than two commercially available igg indirect elisa kits. these
results suggest recombinant denv 2 ns5 effective antigen for
detection dengue virus infection. recombinant ns5-c70 may also used 
an auxiliary antigen diagnostic purposes.
