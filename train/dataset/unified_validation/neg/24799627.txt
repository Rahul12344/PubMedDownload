certain verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) o157 phage types (pts),
such pt8 pt2, associated severe human infections, others,
such pt21, seem restricted cattle. attempt delve the
mechanisms underlying differential distribution pts, performed
microarray comparison human pt8 animal pt21 vtec o157 isolates. main
differences observed vtx2-converting phages, pt21 strains
bearing phage identical present reference strain edl933, bp933w,
and pt8 isolates displaying lack hybridization regions 
phage genome. focused region spanning gam cii genes and
developed pcr tool investigate presence pt8-like phages panel of
vtec o157 strains belonging different pts determined vtx2 phage
reacting primers deployed, named φ8, frequent vtec 
o157 strains human disease bovine strains. differences were
observed production vt2 mrna φ8-positive strains compared
with vtec o157 possessing bp933w. nevertheless, show gam-cii region
of phage φ8 might carry genetic determinants downregulating transcription 
the genes encoding components type iii secretion system borne the
locus enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island.
