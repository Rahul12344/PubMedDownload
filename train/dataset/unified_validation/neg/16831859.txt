identification hiv-1 transcription inhibitors previously performed using
infectivity assays. de novo hiv-1 infection highly sensitive even minor 
compound toxicities, assays plagued extremely high levels of
false-positive hits. hit identification complicated because
infectivity assays lack target specificity. authors demonstrate is
possible overcome limitations establishing stable, chronically
actively hiv-1-infected reporter cell line exclusively identifies hiv-1
transcription inhibitors. reporter cell line, 2 spectrally separated
fluorescence proteins serve simultaneously accessible quantitative markers 
hiv-1 expression drug toxicity. combined analysis markers
drastically reduces level false-positive hits. determination of
fluorescence intensity plate-based format performed noninvasive 
manner, repeated measurements fluorescence levels several days after
compound addition used define kinetic dynamic characteristics
of inhibitory drug effects. addition, stable nature the
reporter cell line, assay requires cell manipulation assay
preparation assay analysis, rendering system extremely cost-effective 
reliable.
