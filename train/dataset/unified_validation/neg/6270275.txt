persistently infected cell lines.

hvj isolated culture fluids g2, thel gm2 cells persistently infected 
with hvj (g2-hvj, thel-hvj gm2-hvj) characterized comparison with
wild-type hvj (hvjo). viral structural proteins analysed 10%
sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis found p
polypeptides hvj clones isolated g2-hvj cells smaller size 
mol. wt. 77 000 (77k), hvjo mol. wt. 79 000 (79k). one 
of six clones thel-hvj cells one ten clones gm2-hvj cells
exhibited migration pattern p polypeptide clones 
g2-hvj cells. however, structural proteins different from
those wild-type virions. clones carrier cultures were
temperature-sensitive blocked early step(s) required rna
synthesis. results indicate mutations(s) associated p
polypeptides could occur course hvj persistent infection cell
