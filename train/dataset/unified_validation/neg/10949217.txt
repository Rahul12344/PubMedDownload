brain tumours common solid tumour children. however, little is
known aetiology, small percentage cases be
attributed established risk factors. exposure farm animals pets have
been considered possible risk factors childhood brain tumour (cbt)
development several reasons. numerous factors associated farm life,
including bacteria, pesticides, solvents animal oncogenic viruses, 
been found induce brain tumour formation animals. studies found
viral gene sequences human brain tumours. epidemiological studies brain
tumours adults reported increased risk among veterinarians and
farmers. review, data examined seven case-control studies
published 1979 1998 considered possible relationship between
fetal childhood exposure farm animals pets cbt. five seven
studies examined childhood farm residence exposure mother child farm 
animals and, five, four reported elevated risk cbt odds ratios 
(or) ranging 0.9 2.5 maternal exposures 0.6 6.7 for
children's exposures. later studies larger subsequently examined
histological type reported excess risk primitive neuroectodermal tumours 
(pnets) farm residence prenatally (or = 3.7, ci = 0.8, 24) childhood
(or = 5.0, ci = 1.1, 4.7). increased risk pnet also associated with
maternal exposure pigs (or = 12, ci = .1, 47) poultry (or = 4.0, ci = 1.2, 
13). results studies showed consistent relationships
between farm life farm animals cbt.
