the innate immune system provides protection invading neurotropic
viruses. acts first line defense invading viruses plays 
an elementary role pathogenesis. list viruses capable of
infecting human central nervous system (cns) quite long, important of
them japanese encephalitis virus (jev), rabies virus, west nile virus (wnv), 
herpes simplex virus (hsv), st. louis encephalitis virus (slev), la crosse virus,
tick borne encephalitis virus (tebe) polio virus. germ line pattern
recognition receptors (prrs) toll like receptors (tlrs), nucleotide
binding oligomerization domain (nod) - like receptors (nlrs), retinoic
acid-inducible gene (rig-i) -like helicases rig-i-like receptors (rlrs) 
cytosolic dna sensors recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns
(pamps) initiate immune response invading pathogen. although prrs 
were originally characterized peripheral immune cells accumulating
evidence also suggest crucial roles cns combat neurotropic
viruses. review, highlight recent developments our
understating mechanisms prrs resident brain cells provide
protection invading neurotropic viruses.
