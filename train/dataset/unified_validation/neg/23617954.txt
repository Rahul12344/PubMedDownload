cd16-rige chimeric human membrane glycoprotein consisting cd16
ectodomain fused transmembrane domain cytoplasmic tail gamma
chain high affinity receptor ige (rige). coexpression cd16-rige 
hiv-1 pr55gag polyprotein precursor (pr55gaghiv) insect cells resulted 
incorporation cd16-rige glycoprotein envelope extracellular
virus-like particles (vlps), phenomenon known pseudotyping. taking advantage
of property, replaced cd16 ectodomain cd16-rige envelope
glycoprotein domain iii (diii) dengue virus serotype 1 (denv1) west nile
virus kunjin (wnvkun). two resulting chimeric proteins, diii-denv1-rige and
diii-wnvkun-rige, addressed plasma membrane, exposed surface
of human insect cells, incorporated extracellular vlps when
coexpressed pr55gaghiv insect cells. diii domains accessible 
the surface retroviral vlps, shown reactivity specific
antibodies, notably antibodies patient sera. diii-rige proteins were
found incorporated vlps made siv, mlv, chimeric mlv-hiv gag
precursors, indicating diii-rige could pseudotype wide variety of
retroviral vlps. vlp-displayed diii capable inducing specific
neutralizing antibodies denv wnv mice. although neutralization
response modest, data confirmed capability diii induce a
flavivirus neutralization response, suggested vlp-displayed
cd16-rige-based platform could developed vaccine vector different
flaviviruses viral pathogens.
