signalling clearly established. work shows flaviviruses,
including dengue, zika, west nile tick-borne encephalitis viruses, activate
the unfolded protein response transcription interferon regulatory
factor 3 induced genes. infection conditions unfolded protein response
priming leads early activation innate antiviral responses cell

only physiological reaction cell viral infection, also synergizes
with pattern recognition sensing mount potent antiviral response.
