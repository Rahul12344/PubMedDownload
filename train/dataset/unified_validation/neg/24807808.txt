mutations cep290 common cause leber congenital amaurosis
(lca), severe inherited retinal degenerative disease is
currently cure. autosomal recessive cep290-associated lca good candidate 
for gene replacement therapy, cells derived affected individuals give
researchers ability study human disease therapeutic gene correction in
vitro. report development lentiviral vectors carrying full-length 
cep290 purpose correcting cep290 disease-specific phenotype in
human cells. lentiviral vector containing cmv-driven human full-length cep290
was constructed. following transduction patient-specific, ipsc-derived,
photoreceptor precursor cells, reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis western
blotting revealed vector-derived expression. as cep290 important in
ciliogenesis, ability fibroblast cultures cep290-associated lca
patients form cilia investigated. cultures derived patients,
fewer cells formed cilia compared with unaffected controls. cilia were
formed shorter patient-derived cells cells unaffected
individuals. importantly, lentiviral delivery cep290 rescued ciliogenesis 
defect. successful construction viral transfer full-length cep290
brings us closer goal providing gene- cell-based therapies for
patients affected common form lca.
