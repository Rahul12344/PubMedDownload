data antifungal prophylaxis paediatric cancer patients high risk for
invasive fungal disease (ifd) scant. intermittent administration liposomal
amphotericin b (lamb) shown safe effective adult patients
with haematological malignancies. prospectively evaluated safety and
efficacy prophylactic lamb dosage 2.5 mg/kg twice weekly children
at high risk ifd. efficacy compared historical control
group patients similar demographic characteristics receiving lamb
prophylaxis. total 46 high-risk patients (24 boys; mean age, 7.7 years) with
187 episodes antifungal prophylaxis analysed. median duration of
neutropenia (<500/μl) 10 days. lamb discontinued four patients because
of acute allergic reactions. median values creatinine liver enzymes at
end treatment differ significantly baseline.
hypokalaemia (<3.0 mmol/l) occurred 13.5% prophylactic episodes, 
was usually mild always reversible. proven/probable ifd occurred in
patients receiving lamb prophylaxis. comparison, five proven two probable 
ifds observed 45 historical controls receiving lamb prophylaxis (p
0.01). lamb prophylaxis impact use empirical antifungal therapy.
systemic antifungal prophylaxis lamb 2.5 mg/kg twice weekly feasible 
safe, seems effective approach antifungal prophylaxis in
high-risk paediatric cancer patients.
