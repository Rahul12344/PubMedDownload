highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) a(h5nx) viruses continue pose a
pandemic threat. us national vaccine stockpiles cornerstone the
influenza pandemic preparedness plans. however, continual genetic antigenic
divergence a(h5nx) viruses requires development effective vaccination
strategies using stockpiled vaccines adjuvants pandemic preparedness.
human sera collected healthy adults received either homologous (2 doses 
of as03a-adjuvanted a/turkey/turkey/1/2005, a/turkey), heterologous (primed 
with as03a-adjuvanted a/indonesia/5/2005, a/indo, followed a/turkey boost)
prime-boost vaccination regimens analyzed hemagglutination inhibition and
microneutralization assays 8 wild-type hpai a(h5nx) viruses 6
genetic clades. molecular, structural antigenic features a(h5nx)
viruses could influence cross-clade antibody responses also
explored. compared homologous prime-boost vaccinations, priming clade
2.1.3.2 antigen (a/indo) followed one booster dose clade 2.2.1 antigen
(a/turkey) administered 18 months apart compromise antibody responses
to booster vaccine (a/turkey), also broadened cross-clade antibody
responses several antigenically drifted variants 6 heterologous clades,
including antigenically distant a(h5n8) virus
(a/gyrfalcon/washington/410886/2014, clade 2.3.4.4) caused recent outbreaks 
in us poultry. magnitude breadth cross-clade antibody responses
against emerging hpai a(h5nx) viruses associated genetic, structural and
antigenic differences vaccine viruses enhanced inclusion of
an adjuvant. heterologous prime-boost vaccination as03a adjuvanted vaccine
offers vaccination strategy use existing stockpiled vaccines pandemic
preparedness new emerging hpai a(h5nx) viruses.
