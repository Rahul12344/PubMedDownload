recombinant technology transfusion medicine really begun have
large-scale impact. preparation blood products, determination blood
group phenotype, detection blood group specific antibodies currently 
employ dna-based methods preparation detection. detection of
bloodborne viruses, production blood grouping reagents diagnosis hla
polymorphism include recombinant dna-based technologies beginning 
impact routine laboratory life transfusion medicine. review analyses
the current use recombinant technology transfusion medicine, indicates 
where likely significant development methodology
(particularly molecular diagnostics) oven next decade so. impact of
molecular medicine field transfusion already begun. recent
licensing thrombopoietin clinical use may profound effect the
very high current demand platelet transfusions. gene therapy protocols for
the treatment haemophilias coagulation disorders, production
of recombinant blood products may reshape demand clotting factors from
human plasma. also consider potential impact exciting technologies
of dna arraying nucleic acid therapeutics fields molecular
diagnostics possible treatment leukemia respectively.
