western honey bees (apis mellifera) important pollinators ecosystem
and also play crucial economic role honey industry. last
decades, continuous decay registered honey bee populations worldwide,
including hungary. study, used metagenomic approaches conventional 
pcr screening healthy winter mortality affected colonies multiple
sites hungary. major goal discover presumed bee pathogens with
viral metagenomic experiments gain prevalence distribution data by
targeted pcr screening. examined 664 honey bee samples collected
during winter mortality three seemingly healthy colonies one colony
infested heavily parasitic mite varroa destructor 2016 2017. the
subsequent pcr screening honey bee samples revealed abundant presence of
apis mellifera filamentous virus (amfv) first time central europe.
based phylogeny reconstruction, newly-detected virus found 
closely related chinese amfv strain. sequence data multiple
countries would needed studying detailed phylogeographical patterns
and worldwide spreading process amfv. report prevalent presence of
this virus hungarian honey bee colonies.
