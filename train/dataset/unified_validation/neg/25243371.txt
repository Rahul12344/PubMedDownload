kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv, also named human herpesvirus 8
hhv-8) cause kaposi sarcoma (ks), common malignancy in
hiv-infected individuals worldwide, primary effusion lymphoma (pel) and
multicentric castleman disease (mcd). kshv double-stranded dna virus that
encodes several homologues cellular proteins. structural similarity
between viral host proteins explains viral homologues function as
their host counterparts, sometimes unusual anatomical sites and
inappropriate times. cases, structural modification viral
proteins suppress override function host homologue,
contributing kshv-related diseases. example, viral il-6 (vil-6) is
sufficiently different human il-6 activate gp130 signaling independent of
the Î± subunit. consequence, vil-6 activate many cell types are
unresponsive cellular il-6, contributing mcd disease manifestations. here, 
we discuss molecular biology kshv homologues cellular products as
conduits virus/host interaction focus identifying new strategies for
therapy ks kshv-related diseases.
