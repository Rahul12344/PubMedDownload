the canarypox (cp) fowlpox (fp) viruses, unable replicate
productively non-avian species, utilized live vectors carrying
the hiv-1sf2 env gene putative immunosuppressive (is) region complete
(cpis+ fpis+) deleted (cpis- fpis-). determine avipox-env 
recombinants could utilized elicit specific immune response against
hiv-1, six groups rabbits immunized cpis+, cpis-, fpis+, fpis-
constructs non-engineered wild-type cpwt fpwt counterparts. a
primary inoculation successive boosters, env-specific humoral and
cell-mediated immunity demonstrated elisa, immunoblots and
lymphoproliferation assays. antibody titres neutralization activities were
higher cp- fp-inoculated rabbits, cpis+ always showing similar
immunogenic capacity cpis-. evidence also presented indicating rabbit 
sera possess group-specific antibodies, were, however, unable to
cross-neutralize divergent hiv-1 strains. although protective capacity
against hiv-1 experimental infection yet determined these
animals, results suggest recombinants might represent promising
and safer candidate vaccines hiv-1.
