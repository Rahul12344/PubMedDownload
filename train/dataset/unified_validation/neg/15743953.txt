the temperate salmonella enterica bacteriophage l close relative very
well studied bacteriophage p22. study show l procapsid
assembly dna packaging genes, encode terminase, portal, scaffold, and
coat proteins, extremely close relatives homologous p22 genes (96.3 to
99.1% identity encoded amino acid sequence). however, also identify l
gene, dec, present p22 genome encodes protein
(dec) present surface l virions 150 180
molecules/virion. also show dec protein trimer solution and
that binds p22 virions numbers similar l virions. its
binding dramatically stabilizes p22 virions disruption magnesium ion
chelating agent. dec protein binds p22 coat protein shells expanded 
naturally vivo sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment vitro not
bind unexpanded procapsid shells. finally, analysis phage l restriction
site locations number patches nucleotide sequence suggest phages
st64t l extremely close relatives, perhaps two closest relatives that
have independently isolated date among lambdoid phages.
