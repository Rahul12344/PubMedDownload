background: low proportion cd28cd8 cells express cd57 associated
with increased mortality hiv infection. effect increasing body mass
index (bmi) changes proportion cd57cd28cd8 cells among hiv-infected
individuals antiretroviral therapy unknown.
setting: us cohort hiv-infected women, evaluated associations bmi
and waist circumference 3 distinct cd8 cell phenotypes: % cd28cd57cd8 t
cells, % cd57 cd28cd8 cells, % cd28 cd8 cells.
methods: multivariable linear regression analysis used estimate beta
coefficients 3 t-cell phenotypes. covariates included hiv parameters 
(current nadir cd4, current viral load), demographics (age, race, income, and
study site), lifestyle (tobacco alcohol use) factors.
results: 225 participants, median age 46 years 50% obese (bmi
>30 m/kg). greater bmi waist circumference associated higher %
cd28cd57cd8 cells % cd57 cd28cd8 cells multivariable analysis, 
including adjustment hiv viral load (all p < 0.05). association between
greater bmi overall proportion cd28 cd8 cells fully adjusted models
(0.078, 95% confidence interval: -0.053 0.209) significant.
conclusions: analysis, greater bmi waist circumference associated
with greater expression cd57 cd28cd8 cells greater proportion of
cd57cd28 cd8 cells. findings may indicate increasing bmi is
immunologically protective hiv-infected women. future research needed to
understand prognostic importance associations clinical outcomes.
