the ccr5 chemokine receptor crucial human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) infection, acting principal coreceptor hiv-1 entry and
transmission thus attractive target antiviral therapy. studies have
suggested ccr5 surface density conformational changes subsequent 
virion engagement rate limiting entry, consequently, infection. not
all ccr5 antibodies inhibit hiv-1 infection, suggesting need potent
reagents. evaluated full length single chain (flsc) igg1, novel
igg-cd4-gp120(bal) fusion protein several characteristics make an
attractive candidate treatment hiv-1 infections, including bivalency a
potentially increased serum half-life flsc, parental molecule. flsc igg1
binds two domains ccr5, n-terminus second extracellular loop,
lowering levels available ccr5 viral attachment sites. furthermore, flsc
igg1 synergizes maraviroc (mvc), licensed ccr5 antagonist. 
study, used microscopy functional assays address mechanistic
aspects interactions flsc igg1 mvc context ccr5
conformational changes viral infection. used novel stochastic optical
reconstruction microscopy (storm), based high resolution localization of
photoswitchable dyes visualize direct contacts flsc igg1 ccr5. 
compared viral entry inhibition flsc igg1 ccr5 blockers and
showed flsc igg1 potent. also showed lower ccr5 surface
densities hiv-1 infected primary cells result lower flsc igg1 ec50 values. 
in addition, ccr5 binding flsc igg1, ccr5 ab 2d7, significantly
increased cells treated mvc, suggesting mvc allosterically
increases exposure flsc igg1 binding site. data implications
for future antiviral therapy development.
