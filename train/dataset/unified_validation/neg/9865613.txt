singlet oxygen (1o2, 1delta(g)) selectively oxidizes many biological targets,
some which, viruses, located intracellularly vivo
conditions. considering short lifetime 1o2 aqueous media, is
essential generate species close proximity targets. therefore, 
a water-soluble non-ionic carrier 1o2, dhpno2, designed convey
1o2 lipid membranes. contrast known anionic carrier ndpo2,
which inactivates extracellular enveloped viruses, new compound exhibits
virucidal activity types viruses, enveloped (hiv) non-enveloped
(poliovirus), extracellular intracellular. hiv inactivation also be
achieved presence red blood cells, suggesting possible use of
dhpno2 decontamination cellular blood products.
