background: treatment recurrent hepatitis c (hcv) following liver transplant
currently includes alpha-interferon ribavirin.
objective: aim study evaluate nonresponder protocols for
patients failing current treatment recurrent hepatitis c following liver
transplantation.
methods: february 1998 november 2002, 67 patients, serum
rna-positive hepatitis c histological evidence recurrent hepatitis c,
underwent treatment alpha-interferon ribavirin. patients failed 
initial treatment, patients begun either amantadine along with
interferon/ribavirin peginterferon ribavirin.
results: initial 67 patients, complete viral clearance only
14.9% (10/67). 57 remaining patients clearing virus, 30 (52.6%)
were taken treatment due adverse events associated bone marrow or
hemoglobin suppression. amantadine group (n = 12), three (25%) to
discontinue due cns side effects slurred speech, dizziness, increased
depression. amantadine group, patients cleared virus 
a one log drop viral load (1.6 x 10(6) vs 0.9 x 10(6); p =.4). the
peginterferon group, three (20%) patients complete viral
clearance treatment similar drops amantadine. also seen 
a biochemical response month 3 peginterferon, seen with
amantadine.
conclusions: peginterferon ribavirin appears superior amantadine
with interferon/ribavirin used nonresponders hepatitis c viral
clearance.
