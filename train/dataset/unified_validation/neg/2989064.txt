two continuously growing vito cell lines, pb-1049 ln-1049, were
established patient ph1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in
extramedullary blastic crisis. pb-1049 established epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-infected peripheral lymphocytes patient 46,xy,t(9;22)
karyotype. cell line shown tumorigenic nude mice, cultured 
cells recovered tumor nodule showed 46,xy,6p+,t(9;22) stem line
karyotype. ln-1049 derived lymph node culture patient, and
was found non-tumorigenic nude mice karyotypically normal.
immunological examinations ebv-induced antigens, surface cytoplasmic
immunoglobulin, monoclonal antibodies, enzymatic electron
microscopic studies revealed cell lines attained differentiation
into late-b cell stage.
