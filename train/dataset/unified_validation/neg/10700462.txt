previous studies illustrated influence cell subsets susceptibility or
resistance demyelination theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus
(tmev) model multiple sclerosis. genetic segregation analysis showed a
correlation disease phenotype model particular v(beta) genes.
in study investigated contribution specific v(beta) tcr the
pathogenesis virus-induced demyelinating disease. spectratype analysis of
cells infiltrating cns early infection demonstrated over-representation
of v(beta)8(+) cells mice expressing susceptible h-2 haplotype. we
infected transgenic mice expressing v(beta)8.2 tcr directed a
non-tmev antigen found increase demyelinating disease mice either
susceptible resistant background compared littermate controls. in
addition, depletion studies anti-v(beta)8-specific antibody both
susceptible (b10.q) resistant (c57bl/6) mice resulted increased
demyelination. tcr analysis vp2-specific cytotoxic cell clones mice
with resistant genotype identified v(beta)8.1 tcr, suggesting that
limited cell diversity critical tmev clearance. together, results
support protective role v(beta)8(+) cells virus-induced demyelinating 
disease.
