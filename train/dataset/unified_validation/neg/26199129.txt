pegylated interferon ribavirin combination therapy effectively suppresses
viral replication 50 %-60 % hepatitis c virus (hcv)-infected patients.
however, hcv-infected patients often display varied responses therapy, and
strains subtype lb (the widespread hcv subtype worldwide) have
more-severe clinical manifestations, greater viral loads, poorer responses to
interferon treatment. therefore, understanding genomic variability hcv 
crucial treatment hcv infection. study, used appropriate
software analyze nucleotide, amino acid sequences envelope
proteins (e1 e2) hcv investigate extent variability in
several hcv subtypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a 6a) calculated ratio
of nonsynonymous synonymous substitutions (dn/ds) proteins to
investigate immunological pressure acting them. also predicted the
n-glycosylation sites e1 e2 determine association viral
neutralization. found e1 variable, higher dn/ds ratio, 
has n-glycosylation sites e2 hcv subtype 1b. indicates the
variability e1, dn/ds ratio, degree n-glycosylation might play 
an important role treatment infection hcv subtype 1b.
