the hepatitis b virus (hbv) circular dna genome 3,200 base pairs. 
economical use genome overlapping reading frames may led to
severe constraints nucleotide substitutions along genome highly
variable rates substitution among nucleotide sites. nucleotide sequences 
13 complete hbv genomes compared examine variability substitution
rates among sites examine phylogenetic relationships among hbv
variants. maximum likelihood method employed fit models dna
sequence evolution account complexity pattern of
nucleotide substitution. comparison models suggests rates of
substitution different different genes codon positions; example,
the third codon position changes rate ten times higher second 
position. furthermore, substantial variation substitution rates detected
even effects genes codon positions corrected; is,
rates different different sites gene codon
position. rates correction also found positively
correlated adjacent sites, indicated existence conserved and
variable domains proteins encoded viral genome. multiparameter
model validates earlier finding variation nucleotide conservation
is random around hbv genome. test existence molecular
clock suggests substitution rates less constant among lineages. 
the phylogenetic relationships among viral variants examined. although
the data seem contain sufficient information resolve details 
the phylogeny, appears quite certain serotypes viral variants 
do reflect genetic relatedness.
