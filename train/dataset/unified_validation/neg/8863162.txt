we describe two female monozygotic (mz) twins heterozygous fabry disease, 
x linked disorder resulting deficient activity alpha-galactosidase a.
while one twins clinically affected, asymptomatic.
enzymatic assay alpha-galactosidase blood leucocytes, skin fibroblasts,
epstein-barr virus transformed lymphoid cell lines, hair follicles the
twins parents confirmed heterozygous status twins and
indicated fabry disease occurred result de novo mutation. 
son unaffected twin sister shown hemizygous. molecular analysis 
of alpha-galactosidase gene permitted identification yet
undescribed point mutation position 10182 exon 5 causes asp asn
substitution codon 231. single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)
analysis showed heterozygous status twins normal pattern
in parents. basis discordant expression novo mutation
in twins investigated studying x inactivation status. analysis
of inactive x specific methylation androgen receptor gene showed
unbalanced inactivation twins' fibroblasts opposite directions.
while maternally derived x chromosome preferentially active the
asymptomatic twin, paternal x chromosome active other, affected
twin found hemizygotic nephew. data suggest the
paternal x chromosome carries de novo alpha-galactosidase mutation that
uneven x inactivation underlying mechanism disease expression 
novel female mz twin pair. first documented case female twins
discordant fabry disease.
