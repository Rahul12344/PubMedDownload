background: developed multiple stable cell lines containing subgenomic
hcv rna resistant treatment interferon alpha (ifn-α.
characterization ifn-α resistant replicon cells showed defects the
phosphorylation nuclear translocation stat1 stat2 proteins due a
defective jak-stat pathway.
methodology/principal findings: study, developed alternative
strategy overcome interferon resistance cell culture model improving
intracellular stat1 signaling. engineered stat1-cc molecule double
cysteine substitutions src-homology 2 (sh2) domains stat1 (at ala-656
and asn-658) efficiently phosphorylates translocates nucleus of
ifn-resistant cells ifn-γ dependent manner. transfection plasmid clone
containing stat1-cc significantly activated gas promoter compared wild
type stat1 stat3. activity engineered stat1-cc dependent upon
the phosphorylation tyrosine residue 701, since construct a
substituted phenylalanine residue position 701 (stat1-cc-y701f) failed to
activate gas promoter replicon cells. intracellular expression stat1-cc
protein showed phosphorylation nuclear translocation resistant cell
line ifn-γ treatment. transient transfection stat1-cc plasmid clone into
an interferon resistant cell line resulted inhibition viral replication and
viral clearance ifn-γ dependent manner. furthermore, resistant replicon
cells transfected stat1-cc constructs significantly regulated surface
hla-1 expression compared wild type f mutant controls.
conclusions: results suggest modification sh2 domain the
stat1 molecule allows improved ifn-γ signaling increased stat1
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, hla-1 surface expression, prolonged
interferon antiviral gene activation.
