chromosomal deletions, especially nested deletions, major genetic tools in
diploid organisms facilitate functional analysis large chromosomal
regions allow rapid localization mutations specific genetic
intervals. mice, well-characterized overlapping deletions available
at chromosomal loci, partly due drawbacks existing methods. we
exploit random integration retrovirus generate high-resolution sets
of nested deletions around defined loci embryonic stem (es) cells, sizes 
extending kilobases several megabases. approach expands the
application cre-loxp-based chromosome engineering allows
the construction hundreds overlapping deletions, also provides
molecular entry points regions based retroviral tags. approach 
be extended region mouse genome.
