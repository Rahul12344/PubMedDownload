background: human papillomavirus (hpv) emerged causative agent and
positive prognostic factor oropharyngeal (op) head neck squamous cell
cancer (hnscc). prompts inquiry whether therapy improvements or
increasing incidence hpv drives apparent improvements hnscc outcomes
observed non-randomized clinical trials.
patients methods: reviewed locoregionally advanced hnscc patients
treated chemotherapy radiation prospective institutional trials 
single institution. patients divided three groups (1, 2, 3) according
to treatment time period (1993-1998, 1999-2003, 2004-2010, respectively). we
reasoned favorable trend observed time op non-op
patients, hpv status may confounding treatment effects, whereas would 
unlikely subgroups improved time.
results: four hundred twenty-two patients identified op (55.7%) and
non-op (44.3%) hnscc. five-year op overall survival (os) improved 42.3%
(group 1) 72.5% (group 2), 78.4% (group 3), adjusted p = 0.0084. non-op
5-year os 51.0% (group 1), 58.8% (group 2), 66.3% (group 3), adjusted p =
0.51. five-year recurrence-free survival (rfs) improved op groups 42.3% 
to 68.4% 75.8% (adjusted p = 0.017). non-op 5-year rfs 42.9%, 53.6%, and
61.7% sequential groups (adjusted p = 0.30). five-year op distant
failure-free survival (dffs) improved 42.3% 71.1% 77.8% (adjusted p = 
0.011). five-year non-op dffs 46.9%, 57.1%, 66.0% sequential groups
(adjusted p = 0.38).
conclusions: past two decades, op hnscc outcomes improved significantly,
while non-op outcomes trended toward improvement. although patients 
not stratified hpv status, improving op outcomes likely least partly
due increasing hpv incidence. data justify trial
stratification hpv status, investigations novel approaches for
carcinogen-related hnscc, current de-intensification hpv-related hnscc.
