the neutralizing enhancing activities respiratory syncytial virus
(rsv)-specific antibodies examined. two biological activities were
measured panel six monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific rsv
surface f g glycoproteins. four mabs specific f protein possessed
both neutralizing enhancing activities. one mab (11-2-d2), specific g 
protein, enhanced rsv infection u937 cells, human macrophage cell line, 
did neutralize virus infectivity. one mab (11-3-a3), specific f
protein, efficiently neutralized virus infectivity enhance rsv
infection u937 cells. mab 11-3-a3 neutralized representative strains the
two antigenic subtypes rsv. assays performed mixtures mabs showed that
high concentrations mab 11-3-a3 masked enhancing activity mab 11-2-d2. 
the assay mixtures two mabs possessing enhancing activities
demonstrated response synergistic. role neutralizing and
enhancing antibodies determining outcome rsv infection examined for
infants cord blood serum samples collected birth. 
significant difference magnitude serum-enhancing activities between
infants hospitalized rsv infections group age- and
sex-matched control infants reported respiratory illness requiring
hospitalization. however, results indicated possible correlation between
rsv infection infants occurrence vitro antibody-dependent
enhancement cord blood sera serum dilution 10(-2). significant
inverse correlation found plaque-neutralizing enhancing
activities cord blood sera infants, irrespective subsequent rsv
infection. data discussed relation possible contribution of
antibody-dependent enhancement normal course rsv pathology vivo.
