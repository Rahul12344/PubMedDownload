current knowledge suggests ebv, kshv htlv-1 contribute to
lymphomagenesis subverting host-cell molecular signaling machinery to
deregulate cell growth survival. signaling pathways affected by
these viruses well characterized, nf-kb pathway, is
activated three viruses promote cellular survival inhibiting
apoptosis, thereby playing critical role tumorigenesis. pathways, such
as mtor jak-stat also likely involved viral lymphomagenesis. this
provides opportunity inhibit cellular pathways using drugs developed
for treatment malignancies. however, since compounds target
cellular proteins, always potential toxicity. context of
viral malignancies, unique opportunity targeting viral proteins,
and developing completely specific therapies. examine question
of whether pathobiology ebv, kshv htlv-1 allow use an
approach.
