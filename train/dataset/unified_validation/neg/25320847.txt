there renewed interest tetra-oxy compound +6 oxidation states of
iron, ferrate(vi) (fe(vi)o4(2-)), commonly called ferrate. ferrate the
potential cleaner ("greener") technologies water treatment remediation
processes, produces potentially less toxic byproducts treatment 
chemicals (e.g., chlorine). ferrate strong potential oxidize number of
contaminants, including sulfur- nitrogen-containing compounds, estrogens, and
antibiotics. oxidation capability ferrate combines efficient
disinfection coagulation properties multi-purpose treatment chemical 
a single dose. review focuses engineering aspects ferrate use at
the pilot scale remove contaminants enhance physical treatment water
and wastewater. pilot-scale studies, in-line on-line
electrochemical ferrate syntheses applied. ferrate synthesis,
ferrate directly prepared solution iron anode, followed direct 
addition contaminant stream. older studies applied ferrate a
solid. review presents examples removing range contaminants by
adding ferrate solution stream. results showed ferrate alone in
combination additional coagulants reduce total suspended solids (tss),
chemical oxygen demand (cod), biological oxygen demand (bod), organic matter.
ferrate also oxidizes cyanide, sulfide, arsenic, phenols, anilines, dyes 
disinfects variety viruses bacteria. limitations drawbacks the
application ferrate treating contaminated water pilot scale also
presented.
