infection rowson-parr virus (rpv) induced rapid reduction number of
immunoglobulin-positive theta antigen-positive cells detectable by
immunofluorescence spleens susceptible balb/c mice. changes
produced rpv infection lymph nodes different, since number 
immunoglobulin-positive cells increased proportion theta-positive 
cells remained unchanged. however, ability immunoglobulin-bearing cells to
redistribute receptors caps reduced types lymphoid
tissue. similar pattern changes produced infection friend
leukemia complex, rpv originally obtained. effects rpv
and friend leukemia complex may contribute immunodepressed state of
infected mice.
