objective: immortalize human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) by
ectopic expression telomerase reverse transcriptase enzyme (htert), by
simian virus 40 large (sv40lt) antigen without malignant transformation.
methods: two different retroviruses contained htert/sv40lt cdna fragment and
drug resistance gene constructed, used transfect normal primary 
huvecs. transfected cells screened 500 microg/ml g418 4
microg/ml puromycin. drug resistance cell clones selected 3 days after
transfection cultured studies. inverted microscope a
scanning electron microscope used observe morphology growth of
the cells. expression viii factor transfected dna fragments were
detected identification endothelial origin successful
transfection. expression e-selectin endothelial lipase or
without stimulus tnf-alpha also assayed analyze biological
activity transfected cells.
results: cells homogenous, closely apposed, large, flat, polygonal, 
displayed characteristic ovoid nucleus one two nucleoli formed
monolayer polygonal shape without overlapping. immunocytochemical staining
showed existence viii factor. sv40lt/htert antigen expressed the
transfected cells detected, contrasts non-expression.
telomerase activity cell detected transfected cells, 
0.36 12 th passage 0.38 50 th passage. however, activity the
normal huvecs 1.12 first passage 0.06 third passage assayed
by pcr-elisa. e-selectin endothelial lipase specific in
endothelial cells. expressions two also detected. the
expression e-selectin up-regulated stimulus tnf-alpha,
while expression endothelial lipase unregulated significantly.
conclusion: ectopic expression htert sv40lt effectively immortalize
huvecs without tumorigenesis.
