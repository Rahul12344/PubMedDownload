we present practical description polyethylene glycol mediated spheroplast
transformation halobacterium halobium halobacterium volcanii. method 
has applied phage dna transfection, plasmid dna transformation, and
transformation linear fragments high molecular weight genomic dna.
efficient spheroplast regeneration allows uncomplicated recovery transformed
progeny. transformations performed equally well using fresh frozen cell
preparations. methods find application molecular cloning, genetic
fine mapping, strain construction.
