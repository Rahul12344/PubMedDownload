rubella-specific igm measured single fraction serum sucrose
density gradient. haemagglutination inhibition (hai) tests performed on
paired aliquots fraction untreated treatment 2-
mercaptoethanol, dilutions aliquots incubated night with
rubella antigen addition red cells. 822 sera tested, specific
igm found 249, 492. first tested, remaining 81 sera
gave unsatisfactory results contamination igm fraction igg
(6.0%), probable aggregation igg (3.5%), persistence chick red cell 
agglutinins (0.4%). tests performed 134 patients rubella confirmed
by rise hai antibodies. rubella-specific igm found titre more
than eight sera taken 62 64 patients 10 29 days 
the onset rash one sera taken 80 119 days, 
and none taken later. however, specific igm still found lower
titre sera 13 patients collected 80 162 days the
onset illness. routine diagnostic tests three years serum
from 479 patients suspected acquired rubella, specific igm found a
titre eight 51 patients 10 instances (2.1%) a
lower level pose problem interpretation.
