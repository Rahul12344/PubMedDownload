purpose: mri cell tracking used monitor immune cells involved the
immunotherapy response, providing insight mechanism action, temporal 
progression tumor growth, individual potency therapies. evaluate
whether mri could used track immune cell populations response to
immunotherapy, cd8+ cytotoxic cells, cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ regulatory cells, 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells labeled superparamagnetic iron oxide
particles.
methods: superparamagnetic iron oxide-labeled cells injected mice (one 
cell type/mouse) implanted human papillomavirus-based cervical cancer
model. half mice also vaccinated depovaxtm (immunovaccine,
inc., halifax, nova scotia, canada), lipid-based vaccine platform was
developed enhance potency peptide-based vaccines.
results: mri visualization cd8+ cytotoxic cells, regulatory cells, and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells apparent 24 h post-injection, with
hypointensities due iron-labeled cells clearing approximately 72 h
post-injection. vaccination resulted increased recruitment cd8+ cytotoxic t
cells, decreased recruitment myeloid-derived suppressor cells and
regulatory cells tumor. also found myeloid-derived suppressor
cell regulatory cell recruitment positively correlated final
tumor volume.
conclusion: type analysis used noninvasively study changes in
immune cell recruitment individual mice time, potentially allowing
improved application combination immunotherapies. magn reson med
