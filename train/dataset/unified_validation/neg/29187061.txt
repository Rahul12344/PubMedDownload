introduction: determination resting energy expenditure (ree) essential 
for planning nutrition therapy patients human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) help improve their
nutrition status. aim evaluate agreement accuracy prediction
equations estimate ree mexican population diagnosis of
hiv/aids without antiretroviral therapy (art).
methods: cross-sectional study mexican patients hiv/aids and
without art. weight, height, body composition measured dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry evaluated. ree determined indirect calorimetry
and estimated using mifflin-st jeor (msj), harris-benedict (hb), schofield 1 
and 2, cunningham, melchior 91, melchior 93, batterham equations. the
bland-altman method assessed agreement real estimated values, and
the percent difference values used assess prediction
accuracy.
results: sixty-five adults without art 102 adults art included. the
mean ree (kcal/kg) 24.8 ± 2.4 23.8 ± 3.6 patients without with
art, respectively. good agreement reliability observed hb
(intraclass correlation coefficient [icc], 0.75; p < .05), batterham (icc, 0.79; 
p < .05), schofield 1 (icc, 0.74; p < .05), schofield 2 (icc, 0.78; p < .05) 
results individuals without art. individuals art, good agreement and
reliability observed hb equation (icc, 0.76; p < .05). msj
equation showed good agreement poor reliability (icc, 0.05; p < .05).
conclusion: equations best agreement accuracy schofield 2, 
batterham, hb individuals without art hb msj population
with art.
