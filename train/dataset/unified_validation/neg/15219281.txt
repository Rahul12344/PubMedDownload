in vivo transfer herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase (hsv-1 tk)
gene, subsequent administration antiviral drugs ganciclovir, 
emerged promising gene therapy protocol treating proliferative
disorders. vitro cytotoxicities (ic(50)) two series 5-iodo- and
(e)-5-(2-iodovinyl)-substituted 2'-deoxy- 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-pyrimidine
nucleosides ranged millimolar low nanomolar concentrations mammalian
tumor cell lines (kbalb; r-970-5; 143b; emt-6) counterparts engineered 
to express hsv-1 tk (kbalb-stk; 143b-ltk). hsv-1 tk selectivity indices
ranged one (nonselective) one million (highly selective) based on
cytotoxicity, firu least toxic cell lines, fiau being
most toxic. hsv-1 tk selectivity, based uptake, ranged 10 140, with
ivdu selective hsv-1 tk expressing cells, followed ivfru, firu,
fiau, ivfau finally iudr. phosphorylation [(125)i]fiau led to
incorporation radiolabel nucleic acids, whereas ivfru firu
radioactivity trapped primarily nucleotide pool. data indicate
that cytotoxicity depend initial metabolic trapping (e.g.,
phosphorylation), elaboration mononucleotides cytotoxic
anabolites. lipophilicities nucleoside transport rates six nucleosides
tested within narrow ranges. supports premise cellular
biochemistry, cellular bioavailability, responsible observed
broad range cytotoxicity trapping. vivo biodistribution studies with
5-[(125)i]iodo-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyribouridine (firu),
5-[(125)i]iodo-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyarabinouridine (fiau) and
(e)-5-(2-[(125)i]iodovinyl)-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (ivfru) demonstrate
selective accumulation three radiotracers hsv-1 tk-expressing kbabk-stk
tumors, compared low accumulation non-hsv-1 tk-expressing
kbalb tumors, balb/c mice. summary, nucleosides unpredictably
cytotoxic various cell lines studied, unpredictability extends
across hsv-1 tk expression characteristic; uptake cells engineered
to express hsv-1 tk also dependent molecular construction gene
cassette carrying viral tk gene.
