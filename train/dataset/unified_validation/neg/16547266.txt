profound lymphopenia observed many acute viral infections, and
our laboratory previously documented type ifn-dependent loss cd8 t
cells immediately preceding development antiviral cell response.
most memory (cd44(high)) naive (cd44(low)) cd8 cells susceptible
to ifn-induced attrition, show study ifn-induced
attrition cd8(+)cd44(high) cells associated elevated activation of
caspase-3 caspase-8. questioned whether tcr engagement ag would render 
cd8 cells resistant attrition. tested whether high concentration ag 
(gp33 peptide) would protect lymphocytic choriomeningitis (lcmv)-specific naive
cd8 cells (tcr transgenic p14 cells specific gp33 epitope lcmv) 
memory cd8 cells (gp33-specific lcmv-immune cells) depletion. naive
p14 memory gp33-specific donor cd8 cells decreased substantially 16 h after
inoculation toll receptor agonist ifn inducer, poly(i:c), regardless
of whether high concentration gp33 peptide administered host mice
beforehand. moreover, donor naive p14 lcmv-specific memory cells were
depleted day 2 lcmv-infected hosts 16 h posttransfer. results
indicate ag engagement protect cd8 cells ifn-induced t
cell attrition associated viral infections. addition, computer models
indicated early depletion memory cells may allow generation for
a diverse cell response infection reducing immunodomination
caused cross-reactive cells.
