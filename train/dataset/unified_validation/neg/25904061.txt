endothelial chemokine cxc motif ligand 16 (cxcl16) expression associated 
atherosclerosis, platelets, particularly attaching atherosclerotic
plaque, contribute stages atherosclerotic disease. investigation
was designed examine role cxcl16 capturing platelets flowing
blood. cxcl16 expressed human atherosclerotic plaques, lesion severity
in human carotid endarterectomy specimens positively correlated cxcl16
levels. cxcl16 expression plaques co-localised platelets deposited to
the endothelium. immobilised cxcl16 promoted cxcr6-dependent platelet adhesion to
the human vessel wall, endothelial cells von willebrand factor during
physiologic flow. low shear, immobilised cxcl16 captured platelets from
flowing blood. also induced irreversible platelet aggregation rise in
intra-platelet calcium levels. results demonstrate endothelial
cxcl16's action platelets limited platelet activation, that
immobilised cxcl16 also acts potent novel platelet adhesion ligand, inducing
platelet adhesion human vessel wall.
