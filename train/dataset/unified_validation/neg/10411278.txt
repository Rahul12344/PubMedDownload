imiquimod (s-26308, r-837) (1-(2-methylpropyl)-1h-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4
amine), immune response modifier, demonstrates potent antiviral antitumor 
activity animal models (see structure fig. 1). drug exhibits direct 
antiviral antiproliferative activity tested number cell culture
systems. imiquimod's activity discovered screening anti-herpes
virus activity. one first analogs series, s-25059 tested the
early 1980's due slight toxicity, caused slightly reduced herpes
cytopathology vero cell cultures. follow-up testing herpes infected guinea 
pigs showed complete protection toward lesion development. activity these
drugs results primarily interferon alpha (ifn-alpha) induction other
cytokine induction. least part cytokine induction mediated through
nf-kappab activation. cytokines stimulate several aspects the
innate immune response. addition, imiquimod stimulates acquired immunity, in
particular cellular arm important control viral infections
and various tumors. effect mediated drug induced ifn-alpha and
interleukin-12 (il-12) ifn-gamma induced cytokines. imiquimod is
expected effective exogenous ifn-alpha shown utility where
enhancement cell-mediated immunity needed. following brief review 
of preclinical pharmacology imiquimod clinical results genital 
wart trials. mechanism action topically applied imiquimod likely
lead benefits several chronic virus infections tumors the
skin. two reviews imiquimod focus mainly clinical results
have published (beutner & geisse, 1997; slade, owens, tomai & miller, 1998).
