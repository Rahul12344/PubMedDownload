background: adenoviral constructs used studies injury-induced
vascular hyperplasia immunologically naive laboratory animals, their
usefulness intra-arterial gene therapy may limited prevalence of
preexisting immunity adenovirus patient population. here, explored
the efficacy adenovirus-mediated transfer fas ligand, cytotoxic gene with
immunomodulatory properties, inhibiting injury-induced vascular lesion
formation naive immunologically primed animals.
methods results: lesion formation evaluated balloon-injured carotid
arteries naive adenovirus-immunized rats infected with
adenoviral constructs expressing fas ligand (ad-fasl), cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21 (ad-p21), beta-galactosidase (ad-betagal). naive rats,
ad-fasl induced apoptosis medial vascular smooth muscle cells inhibited
intimal hyperplasia 60% relative ad-betagal-treated vessels (p<0.05),
whereas cytostatic agent ad-p21 decreased lesion size 58% (p<0.05). in
animals preimmunized adenoviral vector containing transgene, ad-fasl
significantly inhibited neointima formation (73% reduction, p<0.05), ad-p21
failed inhibit neointima formation relative controls. immunologically
primed rats displayed robust t-cell infiltration ad-p21- and
ad-betagal-treated vessels, t-cell infiltration markedly attenuated in
ad-fasl-treated vessels.
conclusions: data demonstrate adenovirus-mediated fas ligand delivery
can inhibit intimal hyperplasia immunologically primed naive animals,
whereas efficacy adenovirus-mediated p21 delivery limited to
immunologically naive animals. study documents, first time, the
therapeutic efficacy intravascular adenoviral gene transfer animals with
preexisting immunity adenovirus.
