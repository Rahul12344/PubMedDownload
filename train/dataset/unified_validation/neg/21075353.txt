autophagy influences numerous cellular processes, including innate adaptive
immunity intracellular pathogens. however, viruses, including dengue
virus (denv), usurp autophagy enhance replication. mechanism a
positive role autophagy denv infection unclear. present data that
denv induction autophagy regulates cellular lipid metabolism. denv infection
leads autophagy-dependent processing lipid droplets triglycerides to
release free fatty acids. results increase cellular β-oxidation,
which generates atp. processes required efficient denv replication.
importantly, exogenous fatty acids supplant requirement autophagy in
denv replication. results define role autophagy denv infection and
provide mechanism viruses alter cellular lipid metabolism to
promote replication.
