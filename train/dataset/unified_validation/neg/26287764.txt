experimental animals used extensively goal developing
sight-saving therapies humans. one example development of
transplantation cultured limbal epithelial stem cells (lesc) restore vision
following ocular surface injury disease. clinical trials cultured lesc
therapy underway humans potential companion animal population suffering 
from similar diseases, perhaps time give something back. comparatively
to humans, known healthy limbus corneal surface physiology 
of companion animals still little. blinding corneal diseases animals
such symblepharon cats feline herpes virus-1 infections require a
basic understanding functional companion animal limbus corneal stem
cells. understanding many vision threatening conditions as
scarring cornea post-inflammation lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltrate 
in dogs (aka chronic superficial keratitis) pigment proliferation with
pigmentary keratitis pugs would benefit better understanding the
animal cornea health disease. also vital new therapeutic
approaches considered. review explore current challenges and
future research directions required increase understanding of
corneal diseases animals consider potential development delivery
of cultured stem cell therapy veterinary ocular surface patients.
