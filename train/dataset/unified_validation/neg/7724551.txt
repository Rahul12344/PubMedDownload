plasmid-encoded addiction genes augment apparent stability various low
copy number bacterial plasmids selectively killing plasmid-free (cured)
segregants progeny. addiction module plasmid prophage p1 consists
of pair genes called phd doc. phd serves prevent host death 
prophage retained and, retention mechanisms fail, doc causes death on
curing. doc acts cell toxin phd antidote. study we
show host mutants defects either subunit clpxp protease
survive loss plasmid contains p1 addiction module. small
antidote protein phd fully stable two mutant hosts, whereas is
labile wild-type host. conclude role clpxp addiction
mechanism p1 degrade phd protein. conclusion situates p1 among 
plasmids elicit severe withdrawal symptoms able because
they encode cell toxin actively degraded macromolecule blocks 
the synthesis function toxin.
