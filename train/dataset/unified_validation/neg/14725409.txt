few large studies evaluated risk factors mortality among children
hospitalized pneumonia may contribute suboptimal case management 
efficiency. identify useful screening criteria mortality among children
hospitalized pneumonia developing country setting, conducted a
population-based hospital cohort study among children less 2 years age
admitted pneumonia 1999-2001 one three major hospitals lombok
island, indonesia. 4351 children admitted pneumonia, 12 per cent died
before discharge. case fatality proportions seasonal, peaks occurring
immediately peaks proportion cases positive respiratory
syncytial virus. children oxygen saturation < = 85 per cent age
younger 4 months 5.6 times likely die children none
of predictive factors (95 per cent ci, 4.5-7.1); 83 per cent children
who died one two risk factors. children < 4 months old,
mortality increased oxygen saturation < 88 per cent compared < 80 per 
cent older children. laboratory, physical examination, radiological
findings associated contribute substantially to
mortality prediction. among children hospitalized pneumonia, age less 4 
months hypoxia identified high risk death. age
influences cut-off levels hypoxia.
