major advances monitoring treatment viral infections after
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) achieved last
decade. appropriate extent viral monitoring antiviral therapy remains 
controversial, reports pediatric patients receiving allogeneic
unmanipulated hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) sparse. total 40 pediatric
patients underwent hsct either peripheral blood stem cells (pbscs, n =
30) bone marrow (bm; n = 10) prospectively monitored every week viral
dnaemia (vdna) simultaneous detection cytomegalovirus (cmv), epstein-barr
virus (ebv), human herpesvirus 6 (hhv6), human adenovirus (adv), polyoma bk
virus (bkv) using real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction (pcr). patients 
received prophylactic acyclovir preemptive ganciclovir (gcv) 500
copies/microg dna (ebv/hhv6) >1 copy/microg dna (cmv) detected 2
consecutive measurements. vdna occurred 25 40 recipients (cmv, 11/40
patients [28%]; ebv, 19/40 [48%]; hhv6, 2/40 [5%]; adv/bkv, 1/40) found
exclusively neutrophil engraftment cases day +100.
recurrent vdna (p = .028) (readily treatable) viral disease (p = .003) were
observed predominantly patients suffering nonmalignant diseases, cohort
characterized delayed lymphocyte engraftment. vdna occurred frequently in
hla-mismatched hsct 24 40 patients receiving antithymocyte globulin
(atg). incidence ebv, cmv, increased atg group.
yet, patients, viral loads ebv cmv higher, with
prompt initiation preemptive gcv, posttransplantation lymphoproliferative
disorder life-threatening morbidities occurred. hhv6 typically
detected low viral loads (<10(2) copies/microg dna), 5% hsc
recipients fulfilling hhv6 criteria triggering gcv treatment. in
multivariate analysis, atg treatment, hla mismatch, recipient cmv seropositivity,
and stem cell source, severe acute graft-versus-host disease were
identified independent risk factors vdna. comprehensive viral
monitoring program defined thresholds initiation preemptive gcv
effectively prevents development critical viral disease, even high-risk
patients receiving atg.
