background: ritonavir-boosted darunavir (drv/r) proven potent efficacy when
used heavily pretreated patients, harboring protease inhibitor-associated
resistance mutations. limited data available resistance pattern emerging
in patients failing drv/r subsequent remaining protease inhibitor options.
methods: analysis baseline failure resistance genotypes performed 
patients experiencing virologic failure (>200 copies/ml) least 3 months 
on drv/r (600/100 mg twice daily)-containing regimen.
results: twenty-five highly protease inhibitor-experienced patients were
included. baseline median human immunodeficiency virus type 1 rna 5 log10
copies/ml number total-protease inhibitor, major-protease inhibitor and
drv-associated-resistance mutations 13, 4 3, respectively. median viral
replication duration drv/r selective pressure 34 weeks. emergence of
drv-associated-resistance mutations observed 72% (18/25) patients, at
codons l89i/m/v (32%), v32i (28%), v11i (20%), i47v/a (20%), i54l/m (20%), l33f/i
(16%) i50v (16%). high risk drv resistance observed patients with
2 3 baseline drv-associated-resistance mutations patients more
than 24 weeks ongoing viral replication. according 2007 anrs algorithm,
isolates classified susceptible ritonavir-boosted tipranavir decreased from
baseline failure 76 60% susceptible drv/r 32 12%.
conclusion: emerging mutations observed drv/r failure already
described impact drv efficacy. study provided recommendations to
firstly, reconsider lowering cutoff number drv mutations two; secondly,
avoid keeping patients drv-failing regimen 24 weeks and
thirdly, examine efficacy using tipranavir drv failure.
