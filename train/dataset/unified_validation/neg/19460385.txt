baculoviruses members large, well-characterized family dsdna viruses 
that identified insects orders lepidoptera, hymenoptera,
and diptera. baculovirus genomes different virus species generally exhibit a
considerable degree structural diversity. however, sequenced baculovirus 
genomes closely related viruses structurally similar share
overall nucleotide sequence identities excess 95%. review focuses on
the comparative analysis partial complete nucleotide sequences two
groups closely related baculoviruses broad host ranges: (a) group i
multiple nucleopolyhedroviruses (mnpvs) cluster including autographa
californica (ac)mnpv, rachiplusia ou (ro)mnpv, plutella xylostella
(plxy)mnpv; (b) granuloviruses (gvs) cluster including xestia c-nigrum
(xecn)gv helicoverpa armigera (hear)gv. even though individual viruses in
these clusters share high nucleotide sequence identities, significant degree of
genomic rearrangement (in form insertions, deletions, homologous
recombination resulting allelic replacement) evident alignments of
their genomes. observations suggest important role recombination 
the early evolution biological characteristics baculoviruses two 
groups.
