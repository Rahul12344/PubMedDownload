recombinant baculoviruses used express gp160 envelope glycoprotein of
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) truncated variant
designated gp160(t) lacks transmembrane domain. glycosylation,
proteolytic cleavage, secretion, biological activities gp160 gp160(t) 
160(t) studied spodoptera frugiperda cells. proteins rapidly
glycosylated initially found totally
endo-beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase h (endo-h) sensitive. however, partial
resistance endo-h gradually acquired molecules. gp160 found to
remain cell-associated, whereas gp160(t) secreted culture medium 
large amounts. fraction gp160 gp160(t) appeared proteolytically
cleaved, cleavage product corresponding size gp120 identified 
the culture medium. gp160(t) found interact specifically cd4
receptors without requirement proteolytic cleavage. gp160 protein was
shown expressed surface s. frugiperda cells direct
immunofluorescence. surface molecules biologically active, as
demonstrated ability induce syncytium formation cocultivated
with hela t4 cells.
