background: monitor carrier hosts avian influenza nigeria, randomly
collected cloaca swab specimens 155 ducks live bird market (lbm) in
ibadan, southwest nigeria, july 2011 july 2012.
methods: samples analyzed real-time reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction (rt-pcr) virus isolation carried embryonated
chicken eggs. partial sequencing antigenic cleavage site the
haemagglutinin (ha) gene performed, multiple sequence alignment carried
out using clustalw, phylogenetic tree constructed using neighbor
joining method.
results: twenty (13%) 155 samples positive avian influenza
subtype h5n2 real-time rt-pcr three isolates obtained from
embryonated chicken eggs. partial sequencing amino acid cleavage site of
the ha genes two isolates corresponded pqretgl*f sequence common 
in low pathogenic avian influenza (lpai). phylogenetically, ha genes the
two influenza viruses monophyletic clustered h5n2 viruses detected
in wild ducks africa.
conclusion: occurrence lpai domestic ducks nigeria underscores the
importance continuous surveillance monitoring virus (in country
that considered free avian influenza) order prevent the
emergence virulent strains may spread commercial poultry humans.
