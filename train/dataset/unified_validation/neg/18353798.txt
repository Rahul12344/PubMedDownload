populations experiencing similar selection pressures sometimes diverge the
genetic architectures underlying evolved complex traits. used rna virus
populations large size high mutation rate study impact of
historical environment genome evolution, thus increasing ability detect
repeatable patterns evolution genetic architecture. experimental
vesicular stomatitis virus populations evolved hela cells, mdck cells,
or alternating hosts. turner elena (2000. cost host radiation rna
virus. genetics. 156:1465-1470.) previously showed virus populations evolved
in single-host environments achieved high fitness selected hosts but
failed increase fitness relative ancestor unselected host
and alternating-host-evolved populations high fitness hosts.
here determined complete consensus sequence evolved population
after 95 generations gauge whether parallel phenotypic changes were
associated parallel genomic changes. also analyzed patterns allele
substitutions discern whether differences fitness across hosts arose
through true pleiotropy presence mutation beneficial
in hosts also 1 mutations loci costly the
unselected environment (mutation accumulation [ma]). found ecological
history may influence extent pleiotropy contribute fitness
asymmetries across environments. discuss degree current genetic
architecture expected constrain future evolution complex traits, as
host use rna viruses.
