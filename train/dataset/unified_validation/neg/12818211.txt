the cryoprotective additives (cpas) used frozen storage microorganisms 
(viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa) include variety simple and
more complex chemical compounds, used widely and
with satisfactory results: include dimethylsulfoxide (me2so), glycerol,
blood serum serum albumin, skimmed milk, peptone, yeast extract, saccharose,
glucose, methanol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp), sorbitol, malt extract.
pairwise comparisons cryoprotective activity common cpas used 
in cryomicrobiology, based published experimental reports, indicate the
most successful cpas me2so, methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene
glycol, serum serum albumin, glycerol, polyethylene glycol, pvp, and
sucrose less successful, sugars, dextran, hydroxyethyl starch,
sorbitol, milk least effective. however, diols (as well other
cpas) toxic many microbes. me2so might regarded most
universally useful cpa, although certain cpas sometimes yield better
recoveries particular organisms. best cpa, combination cpas, and
the optimum concentration particular cryosensitive microorganism 
determined empirically. review aims provide summary main
experimental findings wide range additives organisms. brief
discussion mechanisms cpa action also included.
