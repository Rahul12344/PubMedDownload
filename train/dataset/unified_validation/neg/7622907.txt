to determine whether defects mucosal immunity associated invasive
disease caused mucosal pathogen, streptococcus pneumoniae, levels of
salivary immunoglobulins nonspecific immune factors compared subjects
with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection in
hiv-1-seronegative subjects without pneumococcal bacteremia. iga2
subclass may particular importance s. pneumoniae produces iga1
protease, cleaves iga1 iga2. levels (37-56 micrograms/ml) and
proportions (11%-17%) iga2 similar among groups. serotype-specific
capsular salivary iga present minority patients acute
bacteremia. levels lactoferrin increased bacteremia. neither
selective mucosal iga2 deficiency impaired nonspecific upper respiratory
mucosal responses associated invasive pneumococcal disease hiv-1
infection; thus, defects mucosal cellular responses systemic
immunity may predispose hiv-1-infected patients invasive pneumococcal disease.
