fcrγ itam-containing adaptor required cd16 signaling function nk
cells. previously shown nk cells hiv patients receiving
combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) decreased fcrγ expression, the
factors causing unknown. conducted cross-sectional study of
cart-naive viremic patients (art(-)), virologically suppressed patients receiving
cart (art(+)), hiv-uninfected controls. cd8(+) cells activated, as
assessed cd38(+)hla-dr(+) expression, art(-) patients (p < 0.0001), which
was significantly reduced art(+) patients (p = 0.0005). contrast,
cd38(+)hla-dr(+) nk cells elevated art(-) patients (p = 0.0001) did
not decrease art(+) patients (p = 0.88). nk cells art(-) art(+) 
patients showed high levels spontaneous degranulation ex vivo whole blood
assays well decreased cd16 expression (p = 0.0001 p = 0.0025,
respectively), fcrγ mrna (p < 0.0001 groups), fcrγ protein expression (p
= 0.0016 p < 0.0001, respectively), cd16-dependent syk phosphorylation (p
= 0.0001 p = 0.003, respectively). hiv-infected subjects showed alterations
in nk activation, degranulation, cd16 expression signaling, elevated
plasma markers inflammation macrophage activation, is, neopterin 
scd14, remained elevated art(+) patients. alterations nk cell
measures correlate viral load cd4 counts. data show in
hiv patients achieve viral suppression following cart, nk cell activation
persists. suggests nk cells respond factors different those
driving cell activation, associated inflammation hiv
patients.
