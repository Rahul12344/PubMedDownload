2 marker rescue.

chartrand p, wilkie nm, timbury mc.

the physical mapping six ts mutations herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2)
is presented. results obtained 14 separate intratypic marker rescue
experiments analysis 20 hsv-1/hsv-2 intertypic recombinants. order
of mutations physical map hsv-2 unambiguous correlates
almost exactly previously published genetic map timbury & calder
(1976). one mutants studied (hsv-2 ts12) apparently two distinct
conditionally lethal ts mutations, one long short
region hsv genome.
