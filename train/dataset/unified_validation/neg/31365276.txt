introduction: classification lymphomas based postulated normal
counterparts lymphoid neoplasms currently constitutes 100 definite or
provisional entities. number entities implies, lymphomas show marked
pathological, genetic, clinical heterogeneity. recent molecular findings have
significantly advanced understanding lymphomas. areas covered: world
health organization (who) classification lymphoid neoplasms updated in
2017. present review summarizes new findings gained the
areas mature t-cell neoplasms, hodgkin lymphomas, histiocytic/dendritic
cell neoplasms since publication 2017 classification. expert
opinion: although formal revisions classification published only
periodically, understanding pathologic, genetic, clinical features
of lymphoid neoplasms constantly evolving, particularly age -omics
technologies targeted therapeutics. even relatively short time since
the publication 2017 classification, many significant findings have
been identified entities covered review.
