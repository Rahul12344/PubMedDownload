treatment hela cells human interferons inhibited 51cr release cells 
induced ultraviolet-inactivated sendai virus. inhibitory effect became
apparent 6 h interferon treatment persisted 24 48 h. in
the interferon-treated cells, cytolysis inhibited within 10 min after
adding virus inhibitory action suppressed treatment the
cells cycloheximide. mock interferon mouse interferon inhibit
the cytolysis antiinterferon serum neutralized effect interferon. 
these findings indicate sendai virus-induced cytolysis inhibited by
interferon per se. however, interferon influence sendai virus
hemolysis.
