korean haemorrhagic fever (khf) (hantaan virus), rodent-borne viral illness, is
an important cause human disease throughout much asia eastern europe.
the agent responsible khf yet conclusively identified.
plaque-purified khf virus concentrated banded potassium
tartrate gradient. material 1.17-1.19 g/ml band examined electron
microscopy particles morphology identical family
bunyaviridae found. particles aggregated khf serum by
saline solution non-immune serum. identification khf virus member of
the family bunyaviridae implies potential spread arthropod vectors.
