exposure rat thyroid cells 1 week temperature-sensitive variant of
kirsten murine sarcoma virus (kimsv) ras inactivated thyroglobulin promoter
(ptg). cellular dedifferentiation paralleled loss the
thyroid-specific trans-acting factor, tgtf1, binds ptg. ras was
denatured shifting cells 39 degrees c, tgtf1 binding ptg function
recovered rapidly without synthesis new protein. tgtf1 could be
reactivated vitro treating nuclear extracts protein kinase a. 4 
weeks exposure oncogene, denaturation ras longer restored tgtf1
binding reactivated ptg. incubation nuclear extracts protein kinase 
likewise reactivate tgtf1. cells chronically exposed ras did, however,
yield differentiated clones treatment 5-azacytidine. suggest that
ras induces dedifferentiation two sequential steps: (1) ras reduces pka
activity; tgtf1 (or auxiliary protein) becomes dephosphorylated, binding
to ptg abolished. (2) effects ras become imprinted methylation,
possibly tgtf1 gene.
