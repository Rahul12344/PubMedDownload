evidence presence genome-linked protein infectious flacherie
virus.

hashimoto y, watanabe a, kawase s.

the genomic rna infectious flacherie virus (ifv), insect picornavirus, 
shown contain covalently attached substance labeled with
125i-bolton hunter reagent. substance found protein
covalently linked virus genome, cosedimented copurified
with viral rna degraded proteinase k rnases. the
molecular weight protein found 11,500 sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein apparently corresponds
to viral protein genome-linked (vpg) detected mammalian picornaviruses,
because required synthesis viral proteins cell-free
translation system rabbit reticulocyte lysate not
immunochemically related virus capsid proteins. results presented here
leave possibility insect picornavirus also replicates rna using vpg
as primer reported mammalian picornaviruses. observations vpg
of insect picornavirus discussed view point comparative
virology.
