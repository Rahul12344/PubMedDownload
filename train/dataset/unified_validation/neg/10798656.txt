purpose: investigate role macrophages play controlling herpes simplex
virus (hsv)-1 replication infection murine cornea.
methods: macrophage depletion selected tissues virus infection
was achieved repeated subconjunctival (scj) and/or intravenous (iv) injection 
of liposomes containing dichloromethylene diphosphonate (l-cl2mdp). controls
received liposomes containing phosphate-buffered saline (l-pbs). efficiency
of depletion evaluated histologic examination. virus content infected
tissues determined standard plaque assay. delayed-type hypersensitivity
(dth) responsiveness assessed using ear-swelling assay. antibody isotype 
responses virus antigens cytokine production monitored by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
results: balb/c mice given scj injection l-cl2mdp 4 2 days hsv-1
corneal infection found ocular virus titers much 10(5)-fold
higher seen l-pbs-treated controls 8 days infection. 
l-cl2mdp treatment delayed 2 4 days infection, virus titers
in eye analogous control animals. subconjunctival and
submandibular lymph node macrophages mice given local (scj) l-cl2mdp
pretreatment profoundly reduced, whereas number corneal langerhans'
cells lymph node dendritic cells remained unchanged. local l-cl2mdp
pretreatment associated significantly reduced dth responsiveness to
hsv-1 antigen, alteration selected antibody isotype production.
depletion macrophages subconjunctival tissue corneal infection
was accompanied enhanced virus growth early times (2 4 days) after
infection.
conclusions: macrophages play important role restricting hsv-1 growth after
corneal infection. cells appear required development an
acquired immune response, presumably functioning antigen processing and
presentation. hypothesis macrophages major participants innate
immunity hsv-1 corneal infection supported.
