in order better understand airborne transmission newcastle disease, model
system established two trials conducted. twenty-five principal
specific pathogen free (spf) chickens inoculated ndv housed in
one isolator. 6 days chickens challenged, 15 chickens placed 
into another isolator received air supply first isolator. 
ndv aerosol originating inoculated chickens collected glass
impinger-30 (agi-30) study occurrence concentration ndv aerosol.
the antibody response infection assessed hemagglutination
inhibition (hi) test viral shedding detected rt-pcr dot-elisa. ndv
aerosol initially detectable rt-pcr cell culture day 2 3
post-inoculation (dpi). aerosol concentration peaked 1.69x10(4)pfu/m(3)
air 13dpi trial 1, 9.14x10(3)pfu/m(3) air 11dpi trial 2 was
consistently detectable 40dpi. ndv shedding detectable 2 40dpi 
of inoculated chickens 6 days post-aerosol exposed infection (dpi) to
33dpi aerosol exposed chickens. viral strain induced high antibody level, 
both inoculated aerosol exposed chickens. airborne transmission did
occur, shown ndv shedding seroconversion ndv aerosol exposed
chickens. results indicated viruses shed infected chickens readily 
aerosolized airborne transmission ndv possible.
