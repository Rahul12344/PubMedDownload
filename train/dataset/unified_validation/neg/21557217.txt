oncolytic adenoviruses emerging agents treatment cancer by
tumor-restricted virus infection cell lysis. clinical trials shown 
oncolytic adenoviruses well tolerated patients also their
antitumor activity needs improvement. promising strategy toward end 
trigger systemic prolonged antitumor immunity adenoviral oncolysis.
antitumor immune activation depends large part antigen presentation t
cell activation dendritic cells (dcs). thus, likely interaction
of lysed tumor cells dcs key determinant "oncolytic
vaccination." study reveals human dcs effectively phagocytose melanoma
cells late stages oncolytic adenovirus infection, cells die
showing preferentially features necrotic cell death. maturation, migration
toward ccl19 cell stimulatory capacity dcs, crucial steps immune
induction, were, however, induced phagocytosis oncolysate, could be
triggered cytokine maturation cocktail. therefore, oncolytic adenoviruses
and adenoviral oncolysate block dc maturation, contrast to
reports oncolytic viruses. results represent rationale for
inserting immunostimulatory genes oncolytic adenovirus genomes assure
critical dc maturation. indeed, report adenoviral transduction of
melanoma cells cd40l oncolysis triggers maturation human dcs
with cell stimulatory capacity similar dcs matured cytokines. conclude
that triggering shaping dc-induced antitumor immunity oncolytic
adenoviruses "armed" immunostimulatory genes holds promise improving the
therapeutic outcome viral oncolysis patients.
