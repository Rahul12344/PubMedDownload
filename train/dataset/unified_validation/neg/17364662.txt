although lung epithelial cells directly attach basement membrane
underneath vivo, harvested epithelial cells typically cultured type i
collagen gel (col i-gel) vitro. recently developed new culture substratum, 
designated "synthesized basement membrane" (sbm), bared lamina densa 
on fibrillar collagen. validate usefulness sbm substratum airway
tissue reconstitution vitro, cultured rat tracheal epithelial cells sbm 
substratum col i-gel. starting air-liquid interface culture, of
the epithelial cells squamous positive basal cell marker
cytokeratin 14 (ck14). 14 days sbm substratum, ck14-positive cells
differentiated clara mucous cells, also ciliated cells.
those differentiated cells formed pseudostratified-like epithelium the
remaining ck14-positive cells polarized basal side. however, col
i-gel, ck14-positive cells still squamous polarized, and
ciliated cells appear. conclusion, established new culture model 
on sbm substratum basal cells could differentiate ciliated cells. the
application sbm substratum useful study airway epithelial
cell differentiation vitro.
