an earlier finding lymphocytes african patients acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (aids) react rabbit antiserum purified
antigens bovine leukemia virus (blv) prompted study possible
cross-reactions blv-infected ovine cell line human lymphocytes
inoculated strain lymphadenopathy syndrome-associated virus (lav). a
solid-phase radioimmunoassay used detect antigenic markers the
retroviruses. crude extracts short-term cultures lymphocytes infected
with lav bound rabbit antisera lav glycoprotein gp13 (molecular weight
13,000) blv proteins p24 gp51, bind antibodies p24
of human t-cell leukemia virus type (htlv-i). antiserum lav gp13 reacted
with ovine cell line producing blv also weakly virus-free ovine
cells. lymphocyte cultures four african patients aids expressed
blv-related antigens within 6 10 days culture, moment when
particle-bound reverse transcriptase produced. blv-related antigens were
induced lymphocyte cultures healthy individuals addition filtered
supernatant irradiated cells original culture. antisera blv used
in study may prove useful detection aids-associated viruses in
short-term cultures lymphocytes aids patients contacts.
