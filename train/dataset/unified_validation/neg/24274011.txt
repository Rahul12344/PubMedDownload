enbase (biosilta, finland) microbial cultivation system replicates
fed-batch systems sustained release glucose enzymatic degradation
of polymeric substrate. achievable bacterial cell densities recombinant
capripoxvirus protein expression levels, solubility, antigenicity using the
enbase system assessed. bl21-ai escherichia coli expressing capripoxvirus
proteins achieved eightfold higher cell densities grown enbase
media compared standard media. greater yields capripoxvirus proteins were
attained using enbase media, either increases amount expressed 
protein per cell conjunction higher cell density increase 
in cell density alone. addition enbase booster enhanced protein yield one 
of proteins tested reduced yield other. however, amount of
soluble forms capripoxvirus proteins tested different that
observed cultures grown standard conditions. purified capripoxvirus
proteins expressed using enbase standard media assessed their
performance enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) shown be
equally capable specifically binding capripoxvirus antibodies.
