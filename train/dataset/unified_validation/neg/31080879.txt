cancer immunotherapy emergence immune checkpoint inhibitors have
markedly changed treatment paradigm many cancers. function to
disrupt cancer cell evasion immune response activate sustained
anti-tumor immunity. oncolytic viruses also emerged additional
therapeutic agent cancer treatment. viruses designed target 
kill tumor cells leaving normal cells unharmed. part this
process, oncolytic virus infection stimulates anti-cancer immune responses that
augment efficacy ofÂ checkpoint inhibition. viruses capability 
of transforming "cold" tumor microenvironment immune effector cells
into "hot" environment increased immune cell cytokine infiltration.
for reason, multiple ongoing clinical trials combine
oncolytic virotherapy immune checkpoint inhibitors. review detail
the key oncolytic viruses preclinical clinical studies highlight the
results testing checkpoint inhibitors.
