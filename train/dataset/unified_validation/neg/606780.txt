reactivity immunogenicity three inactivated, zonally purified, monovalent 
influenza a/swine virus vaccines studied children adults. dose
of vaccine contained either 400 chick cell-agglutinating (cca) units/0.5 ml or
200 cca units/0.25 ml. vaccines contained either whole virus or
ether-extracted, subunit virus without 1.5 mg a1po4/0.5 ml. children
younger 10 years age received half dose. substantial system reactions, 
including temperature increases 2.2 f-4.9 f, observed children who
received whole-virus vaccines. contrast, ether-extracted, subunit vaccines
(with without a1po4) minimally pyrogenic 185 subjects. two doses of
subunit vaccine subjects younger 25 years age immunologically
equivalent single dose older subjects. concluded two doses of
ether-extracted, subunit virus vaccine hsw1n1 antigen, administered least
four weeks apart, serologically effective immunization seronegative
subjects age dosage regimen used young children
in whole-virus vaccines unacceptably reactive.
