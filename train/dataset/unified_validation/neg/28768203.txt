low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (lpaivs) caused global concern
to public health since first novel lpaiv h7n9 outbreak occurred. the
receptor-binding properties viral hemagglutinin one key factor for
efficient transmission infection humans. recent evidence shows h4
subtype viruses widely circulating domestic poultry human
asymptomatic infections might occurred. here, evaluated the
receptor-binding properties two representative isolates, avian h4n6
(containing q226 g228) swine h4n6 (containing l226 s228), found
that avian isolate preferentially binds avian receptors, whereas swine
isolate preferentially binds human receptors. q226l g228s
substitutions pivotal receptor-binding switch, resulted in
similar human receptor-binding features pandemic h2 h3, implying 
h4 potential cause human infections. early-warning study calls
for future extensive surveillance.
