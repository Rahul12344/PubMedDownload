we previously demonstrated ribozyme located 34 nucleotides
downstream polyadenylation site antigenomic rna hepatitis
delta virus stabilize downstream transcript polyadenylation. here, 
we reports investigations molecular mechanism this
stabilization effect potential role small large delta
antigens. found downstream transcripts polyadenylation were
stabilized ribozyme independently either small large delta
antigen. stabilization effect abolished ribozyme activity was
eliminated mutations either enzyme domain target site the
ribozyme. findings suggested ribozyme activity rather 
the rna structure delta antigens contributed stabilization
effect.
