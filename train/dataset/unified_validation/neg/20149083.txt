aims: anti-enterovirus 71 (ev71) activity six nepalese plants' extracts
and gallic acid (ga) isolated woodfordia fruticosa kurz (family; lythaceae) 
flowers evaluated vero cells.
methods results: anti-ev71 activity tested compounds evaluated 
a cytopathic effect reduction method. results demonstrated flowers'
extracts w. fruticosa exerted strong anti-ev71 activity, 50% inhibitory
concentration (ic(50)) 1.2 microg ml(-1) cytotoxicity a
concentration 100 microg ml(-1), derived therapeutic index (ti) was
more 83.33. rivabirin showed antiviral activity ev71.
furthermore, ga isolated w. fruticosa flowers exhibited higher anti-ev71
activity extract w. fruticosa flowers, ic(50) 0.76 microg 
ml(-1) cytotoxicity concentration 100 microg ml(-1), the
derived ti 99.57.
conclusions: study demonstrated flower extracts w. fruticosa
possessed anti-ev71 activity ga isolated flowers showed stronger
anti-ev71 activity extracts.
significance impact study: results suggest ga w.
fruticosa flowers may used potential antiviral agent.
