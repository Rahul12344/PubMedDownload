treatment cultured bhk cells merocyanine 540 caused non-lytic release
of vesicular material phospholipid composition characteristic of
plasma membrane. protein composition vesicles closely resembled that
of soluble fraction cell, expected exovesicles budding the
cell surface. vesicles prepared cells surface-iodinated 125i contained 
no obvious iodinated membrane polypeptides, suggesting major proteins 
the plasma membrane bhk cell free diffuse lipids. the
procedure described represent general method, applicable wide range
of cell types, isolating plasma membrane vesicles.
