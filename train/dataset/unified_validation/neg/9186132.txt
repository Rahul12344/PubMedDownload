purpose: report value polymerase chain reaction diagnosis a
worsening corneal ulcer.
methods: 6-year-old boy underwent emergent penetrating keratoplasty a
corneal ulcer continued worsen despite intensive antibiotic therapy.
results: examination corneal specimen polymerase chain reaction was
positive varicella-zoster virus negative herpes simplex. based on
polymerase chain reaction studies, diagnosed primary varicella-zoster
keratitis corneal perforation. electron microscopy showed herpetic virus
particles cornea.
conclusions: polymerase chain reaction analysis corneal buttons time of
penetrating keratoplasty may benefit patients undiagnosed recalcitrant
corneal ulcers.
