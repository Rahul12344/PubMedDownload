potent antiretroviral therapy (art) suppresses hiv-1 viral replication and
results decreased morbidity mortality. however, prolonged treatment is
associated drug-induced toxicity, emergence drug-resistant viral strains,
and financial constraints. structured therapeutic interruptions (stis) 
proposed strategy could boost hiv-specific immunity, controlled
exposure autologous virus limited time periods, subsequently control 
viral replication absence art. here, analyzed impact repeated

correlated pretreatment vl, amount viral recrudescence the
treatment interruptions, off-treatment viral rebound rate; (ii) the
magnitude breadth hiv-specific cd8(+) lymphocyte response,
despite marked interpatient variability, increased overall sti. however, the
quantity quality post-sti response comparable response

induced sti correlated decreased viral set point sti; and
(v) hiv-specific cd4(+) lymphocyte responses increased sti, were
subsequently maintained patients low pretreatment plateau vls.
overall, data indicate sti-induced quantitative boosting of
hiv-specific cellular immunity associated substantial change in
