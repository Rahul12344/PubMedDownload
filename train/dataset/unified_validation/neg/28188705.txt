we designed, built 3d printed, screened tubular reactors minimize
axial dispersion serve incubation chambers continuous virus
inactivation biological products. empirical residence time distribution data
were used derive tubular design's volume equivalent theoretical
plate (vetp) values various process flow rates. one design, jig box
(jib), yielded lowest vetp, indicating optimal radial mixing minimal
axial dispersion. minimum residence time (mrt) approach employed, the
mrt minimum time product spends tubular reactor. this
incubation time typically 60 minutes batch process. provide
recommendations combinations flow rates device dimensions for
operation jib connected series meet 60-min mrt. results
show wide range flow rates corresponding volumes, takes
75 ± 3 min 99% product exit reactor meeting 60-min
mrt criterion fulfilling constraint keeping differential pressure
drop 5 psi. conditions, vetp increases slightly 3 5
ml though number theoretical plates stays constant 1326 ± 88. 
also demonstrated final design volume 6% ± 1% larger the
ideal plug flow volume. using device would enable continuous viral
inactivation truly continuous process effluent batch
chromatography column. viral inactivation studies would required validate
such design. © 2017 american institute chemical engineers biotechnol. prog.,
