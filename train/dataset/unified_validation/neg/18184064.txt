in compatible interactions plants viruses result systemic
infection, symptom development major phenotypic trait. however, host
determinants governing trait mostly unknown, mechanisms
underlying still poorly understood. previous study arabidopsis
thaliana-plum pox virus (ppv) pathosystem, showed large degree variation 
in symptom development among susceptible accessions. particular, cvi-1 (cape
verde islands) accumulates viral particules remains symptomless, col-0
(columbia) sometimes shows weak symptoms compared ler (landsberg erecta),
which always shows severe symptoms. genetic analyses col x ler cvi x ler
f2 recombinant inbred line (ril) populations suggested symptom
development well viral accumulation traits polygenic quantitative. 
three symptom quantitative trait loci (qtl) identified could confirmed 
in near-isogenic lines, including psi1 (ppv symptom induction 1), was
identified distal part chromosome 1 ril populations. with
respect viral accumulation, several factors detected and,
interestingly, col x ler population, two three viral accumulation
qtl colocalized loci controlling symptom development, although correlation
analysis showed weak linearity symptom severity virus accumulation.
in addition, cvi x ler ril population, digenic recessive determinant
controlling ppv infection identified.
