many types tumors (e.g. virus-induced tumors, melanomas, tumors
over-expressing certain oncogenes) often express antigens induce
t-cell-mediated tumor-specific immune responses. nonetheless, many tumors
manage circumvent induction effective anti-tumor t-cell response, as
is apparent many tumor-bearing patients. therefore, optimally designed
vaccination protocols may evoke powerful competent t-cell-mediated
anti-tumor response, allowing host effectively deal least some
cancers. vaccination approaches might include immunization whole
(tumor) cell-based vaccines, entire tumor antigens selected t-cell epitopes
derived tumor antigens. survey update several anti-tumor
vaccination approaches employed, novel possibilities target the
anti-tumor immune response preselected tumor-derived t-cell epitopes.
