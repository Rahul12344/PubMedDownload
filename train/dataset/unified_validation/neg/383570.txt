assuming similarity processes illegitimate recombination, as
deletion formation, process f' plasmid formation, undertaken 
the study influence reca- seg- alleles hfr donor f'
plasmid formation. data obtained demonstrate strong influence donor
genotype frequency f' plasmid formation nature f'
plasmids formed, thus demonstrating f' plasmids formed
via recombination hfr donor cells. reca- mutation decreased total
yield f' plasmids selected using proximal distal hfr markers and
affected drastically distribution f' plasmids inheriting different
proximal unselected markers. existence reca-dependent reca-independent
modes f' plasmid formation demonstrated. escherichia coli chromosome
contains regions involve preferentially reca-dependent (between proa and
gal, clockwise gal) reca-independent (between leu proa, the
region counterclockwise arge) recombination. seg-2 mutation causes 
partial block reca-dependent reca-independent recombination pathways,
however causes dramatic decrease genetic exchanges leading formation
of type ii f' plasmids. seg- reca- mutations decrease frequency 
of formation tra+ f' transconjugants. percent tra- transconjugants,
which remain sensitive ms2 q beta donor specific phages, also drops
significantly influence reca- seg- alleles. thus, the
recombination involving f structure wild type strains seg- mutants
occures preferentially points f outside regions essential for
transfer sensitivity male specific phages, reca- reca-ges-
strains points inside regions (tra operon) frequently involved f'
plasmid looping out. exist strict correlation fertility
