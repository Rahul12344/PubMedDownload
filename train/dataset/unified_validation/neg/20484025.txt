innate immune effector mechanisms triggered oncolytic viruses may contribute
to clearance infected uninfected tumor cells immunocompetent
murine hosts. here, developed vitro tumor cell/bone marrow coculture
assay used dissect innate immune sensor effector responses to
intratumoral vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv). found type iii ifn
interleukin-28 (il-28) induced viral activation innate immune-sensing
cells, acting key mediator vsv-mediated virotherapy b16ova melanomas. 
using tumor variants differentially express il-28 receptor, showed
that il-28 induced vsv within tumor microenvironment sensitizes tumor
cells natural killer cell recognition activation. results revealed
new insights immunovirological mechanisms associated oncolytic
virotherapy immune-competent hosts. moreover, defined new class of
tumor-associated mutation, acquired loss responsiveness il-28
signaling, confers insensitivity oncolytic virotherapy a
mechanism independent viral replication vitro. lastly, findings
suggested new strategies manipulate immune signals may enhance viral
replication, along antitumor immune activation, improve efficacy 
oncolytic virotherapies.
