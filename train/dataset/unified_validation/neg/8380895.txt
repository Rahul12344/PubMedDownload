the e6 oncoproteins cancer-associated high-risk human papillomaviruses 
(hpvs) target cellular p53 protein. association e6 p53 leads to
the specific ubiquitination degradation p53 vitro, suggesting model
by e6 deregulates cell growth control elimination p53 tumor
suppressor protein. complex formation e6 p53 requires additional
cellular factor, designated e6-ap (e6-associated protein), native and
subunit molecular mass approximately 100 kda. report purification 
of e6-ap cloning corresponding cdna, contains novel open
reading frame encoding 865 amino acids. e6-ap, translated vitro, the
following properties: (i) associates wild-type p53 presence the
hpv16 e6 protein simultaneously stimulates association e6 p53,
(ii) associates high-risk hpv16 hpv18 e6 proteins absence 
of p53, (iii) induces e6- ubiquitin-dependent degradation p53
in vitro.
