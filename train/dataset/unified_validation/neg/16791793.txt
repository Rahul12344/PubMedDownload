the history bacteriophage (phage) start 1915, twort isolated
an unusual filterable infectious agent excrete patients struck by
diarrhoea; discovery followed analogous, probably independent,
finding d'hérelle 1917. several years phage research made scant
progress great attention paid question phage nature, saw 
the contrast d'hérelle bordet's views (living chemical
nature, respectively). situation changed independent discovery of
lysogeny, 1925, thanks bordet bail: phenomenon considered of
genetical origin, view wollman interpreted assimilating properties 
of phage gene (according previous idea muller). 1930s,
burnet's work opened new era demonstrating occurrence several species
of phages antigenic property. period, physical and
chemical characteristics viruses disclosed thanks, particular,
to work schlesinger, first demonstrated virus (phage) was
constituted nucleoproteins. peculiarity phage finally shown after
the invention electron microscope: h. ruska, 1940, anderson luria
in next years, obtained first images tailed phages, finding that
strongly helped investigation first steps infection process.
the decisive impulse phage virology came delbrück, physicist who
entered biology giving new arrangement. so-called "phage group"
assembled brilliant minds (luria, hershey delbrück himself, later dozen
of scientists): group faced three fundamental questions phage
virology, i.e., mechanisms attack, multiplication lysis. ten years'
time, phage virology became integrant part molecular biology, also thanks
to discovery genetical properties dna: scientific context, 
delbrück, luria hershey's works emerged absolute excellence 
results, led scientists nobel prize. lysogeny however neglected
by phage group: singular property shared bacteria phages was
instead investigated lwoff's group, paris, explained fundamental
features 1950s. "phage's saga" gone important
division molecular biology till today, history far over.
