since discovery involvement pathogenesis simian
immunodeficiency virus infection, role macaque monkey interferon-gamma
(ifngamma) focus particular interest. purpose study was
to express bioactive recombinant monkey ifngamma, well clone cynomolgus
monkey ifngamma cdna. isolation cdna encoding cynomolgus monkey ifngamma
was performed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based
strategy activated monkey lymphocyte cdna templates. cynomolgus monkey
ifngamma consists 165 amino acids including putative signal sequence has
94, 60 39% identity human, bovine murine homolgues, respectively.
monkey ifngamma cdna highly expressed three distinct secreted proteins 
a recombinant baculovirus system. secreted proteins revealed have
antiviral activity 10(8) units/ml characteristic authentic ifngamma a
bioassay cytopathic effect reduction assay.
