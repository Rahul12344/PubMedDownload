cytological screening using pap-smear led remarkable reduction the
mortality cervical cancer. however, due subjective test criteria is
hampered poor inter- intra-observer agreement. reproducible assays
are expected improve current screening avoid unnecessary medical
intervention psychological distress affected women. cervical cancer
arises consequence persistent high risk papillomavirus (hr-hpv) infections.
expression two viral oncogenes, e6 e7, epithelial stem cells is
required initiate maintain cervical carcinogenesis results in
significant overexpression cellular p16ink4a protein. since protein
is expressed normal cervical squamous epithelia, screening p16ink4a
over-expressing cells allows specifically identify dysplastic lesions, and
significantly reduces inter-observer disagreement conventional
cytological histological tests. progression preneoplastic lesions to
invasive cancers associated extensive recombination viral cellular
genomes monitored detection papillomavirus oncogene
transcripts (apot assay) derived integrated viral genome copies. detection
of integrated type oncogene transcripts points far advanced dysplasia or
invasive cancers thus represents progression marker cervical lesions.
these new assays discussed help improve current limitations in
cervical cancer screening, diagnosis, therapy control.
