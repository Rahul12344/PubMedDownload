rna-dependent dna polymerase (reverse transcriptase) avian myeloblastosis
virus: zinc metalloenzyme.

rna tumor viruses contain characteristic rna-dependent dna polymerase (reverse 
transcriptase) thought related induction leukemia 
by virus. disturbance zinc-dependent enzyme system first
postulated account demonstrated differences zinc metabolism of
normal leukemic leukocytes [vallee et al. (1949) acta unio. int. contra
cancrum 6, 869 (1950) acta unio. int. contra cancrum 6, 1102]. order to
investigate relationship zinc initiation leukemia in
chickens avian myeloblastosis virus, examined metalloenzyme nature
of reverse transcriptase. present data show protein zinc
metalloenzyme demonstrating postulated relationship zinc a
leukemic process. paucity purified enzyme generated design novel
system analysis incorporating microwave-induced emission spectrometry combined
with gel exclusion chromatography. provides precision, reproducibility, and
remarkable limits detection mul samples containing 10(-12) 10(-14)
g-atoms metal, thus orders magnitude sensitive other
methods. chromatographic fraction highest enzymatic activity contains
1.8 x 10(-11) g-atoms zinc per 1.6 mug protein, corresponding either 1.8
or 2.0 g-atoms zinc per mole enzyme molecular weight previously
determined either 1.6 1.8 x 10(5). copper, iron manganese absent,
i.e., limits detection, 10(-13) 10(-14) g-atoms. agents
known chelate zinc inhibit enzyme, nonchelating isomers do
not. data underline participation zinc nucleic acid metabolism 
bear importantly upon lesions accompany leukemia zinc deficiency.
