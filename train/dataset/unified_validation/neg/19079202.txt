early profound cd4+ t-cell depletion gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt)
may drive human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) immunopathogenesis, galt immune 
reconstitution highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) may suboptimal.
blood sigmoid colon biopsies collected haart-treated individuals
with undetectable blood hiv rna > =4 years uninfected controls.
hiv proviral levels t-cell phenotype/function examined both
compartments. cd4+ t-cell reconstitution sigmoid, including cd4+ cells
expressing ccr5, exceeded blood differ uninfected
controls. sigmoid hiv proviral load correlated cd4+ reconsitution,
but correlated degree mucosal cd8+ t-cell immune activation.
colonic gag-specific t-cell responses common, associated with
proviral load immune activation. select study population, long-term
haart associated complete cd4+ t-cell reconstitution sigmoid colon.
however, colonic immune activation may drive ongoing hiv replication.
