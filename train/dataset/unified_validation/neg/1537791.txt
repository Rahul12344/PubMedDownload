escherichia coli genes cloned onto multicopy plasmid selected the
ability restore growth protein export defects caused a
temperature-sensitive secy seca mutation. seca51 used primary 
mutation, clones carrying groe, specifies chaperonin class heat
shock protein, obtained. selection using secy24 yielded three major classes 
of genes. first class encodes another heat shock protein, htpg; most
frequently obtained second class encodes neutral histonelike protein, h-ns; and
the third class, msyb, encodes 124-residue protein 38 residues are
acidic amino acids. possible mechanisms suppression well the
significance limitations multicopy suppression approach discussed.
