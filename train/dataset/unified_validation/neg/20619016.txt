viruses long held derailed cellular elements parasitic
replication cycle: since without cell virus. however, explosion
in recently acquired molecular data genome protein sequences leads 
completely different view: viruses contain sequences unique the
biosphere, difficult combine idea cellular origin.
conversely, cellular sequences appear viral origin, the
development dna important carrier genetic information. recent
investigations indicate viruses probably represent crucial step the
evolution cell. idea great step forwards understanding the
evolution cell explains viruses continued exist alongside 
cell based lifeforms. viruses, often considered enemies of
their host, therefore ultimately constitute driving force evolution.
