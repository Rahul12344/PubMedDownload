molecular species interferon induced mouse l cells newcastle disease
virus polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid.

erickson js, paucker k.

interferons stimulated mouse l cells newcastle disease virus (ndv) 
by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid poly(ri).poly(rc). were
fractionated sequential affinity chromatography bovine plasma albumin
(bpa)-sepharose omega-carboxypentyl (ch)-sepharose. based their
interaction ch-sepharose, interferon induced ndv resolved three 
major bands activity (l/ndv-1,2,3) poly(ri).poly(rc)-interferon two
(l/ri:rc-1,2). interferon components purified specific activity
of 3 x 10(7) 4 x 10(7) units/mg protein antibody affinity chromatography
and examined electrophoresis sds-polyacrylamide gels. total five
molecular species thus identified ndv-induced interferon three for
poly(ri).poly(rc) induced interferon, summarized table 1. conclude 
our observations mouse interferons produced l cells multiple
forms specific physiochemical properties proportions determined by
the type agent employed induction.
