the combination modified staphylococci binding assay immune complexes
and western blot analysis described isolation detection antigen
in immune complexes human sera. strategy procedure preclear
immune complexes serum components sequential polyethylene glycol
precipitation incubation insoluble protein conditions which
immune complexes preferentially bound. immune complexes eluted from
protein sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer dissociated acrylamide
electrophoresis. resolved proteins transblotted nitrocellulose, and
antigen detected specific antibody. immune complexes prepared in
vitro antigen (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) focuses well on
electrophoresis potent immunologic probe (antibody) was
available. system, antigen could detected immune complexes were
present sera concentrations low 20 micrograms aggregated-igg eq/ml,
regardless antigen-antibody ratio. demonstrate detection horse
globulin immune complexes patient acute serum sickness and
hepatitis b virus antigen complexes patient vasculitis.
