chlorhexidine incidence severity oral mucositis patients with
cancer evaluated review.
methods: studies limited randomized placebo-controlled trials. three
databases searched: medline (via pubmed), web science, cochrane
library may 25, 2016.
results: ninety-eight abstracts evaluated three independent reviewers.
twelve studies met criteria inclusion. four studies were
assessed unclear risk bias eight high risk. 12
studies, nine included two meta-analyses. pooled results showed that
chlorhexidine significantly reduce incidence mucositis compared to
placebo (p = 0.129), chlorhexidine significantly reduce severity of
mucositis (p = 0.127), although subgroup analysis chemotherapy group
showed trend toward significance (p = 0.054). side effects reported the
included studies teeth staining altered taste perception.
conclusions: systematic review found chlorhexidine significantly
effective reducing severity mucositis (moderate quality evidence)
nor preventing incidence mucositis (low quality evidence). however, 
more studies needed patients receiving chemotherapy only, positive
trend toward significance found (p = 0.054).
