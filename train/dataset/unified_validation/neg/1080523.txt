synthesis reovirus-specific polypeptides cells pretreated with
cycloheximide.

when l cells infected reovirus presence cycloheximide neither 
virus-specific polypeptides viral double-stranded rna synthesized. 
is synthesis viral single-stranded rna, transcribed mainly segments 
l1, m3, s3, s4 10 viral genomic segments, previous work this
has termed early mrna pattern. attempt determine whether 
early transcripts functional mrna's, transcripts allowed to
accumulate period 17.5 h 31 c cycloheximide-treated cells. the
cycloheximide removed cells exposed various periods to
radioactive amino acids label virus-specific polypeptides might be
synthesized. immunoprecipitation technique used separate viral
polypeptides cellular extracts precipitate analyzed on
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. within 30 min cycloheximide
removal, four major polypeptides (lambda2, mu0, sigma2a, sigma3) two
minor polypeptides (lambda1 mu2) found. infected cells without
cycloheximide eight viral polypeptides (lambda1, lambda2, mu0, mu2, sigma1,
sigma2, sigma2a, sigma3) found 17.5 h infection same
pattern found 3 4 h removal cycloheximide 
present 17.5 h infection. latter result shows the
cycloheximide inhibition reversible cells readily recovered and
synthesized normal complement viral polypeptides. one set of
experiments cordycepin added infected cells immediately removal 
of cycloheximide 17.5 h inhibit synthesis new viral transcripts.
during succeeding 4 h presence cordycepin, pattern protein
synthesis obtained 30 min cycloheximide
removal. concluded polypeptides formed right removal of
cycloheximide translation products transcripts accumulated during
cycloheximide treatment and, therefore, transcripts functional
viral mrna's.
