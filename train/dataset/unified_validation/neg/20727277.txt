background: b-cell-specific moloney leukemia virus insertion site 1 (bmi-1) gene,
which plays critical role directional differentiation proliferation of
cells, significant malignant transformation cells. aim study
is investigate levels bmi-1 non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), 
to preliminarily analyze correlation bmi-1 development of
nsclc tissue.
methods: expression bmi-1 detected 25 nsclc tissues well in
the normal paracancerous lung tissues immunofluorescence technique reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr).
results: immunofluorescently, positive expression bmi-1 proteins was
revealed nucleus tumor cells 76%(19 /25) nsclc tissue in
paracancerous lung tissues. rt-pcr results showed expression bmi-1 in
lung cancer tissues significantly higher paracancerous lung
tissues (p<0.05).
conclusions: bmi-1 expressed nsclc may associated the
oncogenesis development lung cancer.
