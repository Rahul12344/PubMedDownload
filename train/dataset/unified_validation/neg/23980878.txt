probis new method identify binding site protein local
structural alignment nonredundant protein data bank (pdb), may 
result unique findings compared energy-based, geometry-based, and
sequence-based predictors. work, binding sites hemagglutinin (ha),
which important target drugs vaccines influenza treatment, 
been revisited probis. first time, identification conserved
binding sites local structural alignment across subtypes strains ha
available pdb presented. probis finds three distinctive conserved sites 
ha's structure (named site 1, site 2, site 3). compared predictors, 
probis one accurately defines receptor binding site (site
1). apart that, site 2, located slightly tbhq binding
site, proposed potential novel conserved target membrane fusion
inhibitor. lastly, site 3, located around helix stem domain recently
targeted cross-reactive antibodies, predicted conserved latest
h7n9 china 2013 strain well. exploration three sites
provides valuable insight optimizing influenza drug vaccine
development.
