the influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha) three conserved oligosaccharides

cell surface exposure determined hemadsorption following
neuraminidase treatment, immunofluorescence staining, by
fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. three stem oligosaccharides
were removed, transport almost completely blocked. two three stem
oligosaccharides, particularly asparagine residues 12 28, were
missing, ha transported surface showed extremely low fusion
activity. mutants lacking one stem oligosaccharide, fusion reduced 
lesser extent. removal stem oligosaccharides resulted also increase in
the ph optimum required fusion. hand, reduction fusion
activity observed oligosaccharides head region ha spike
were removed. results indicate conserved oligosaccharides the
stem stabilize ha form susceptible conformational change necessary 
for fusion.
