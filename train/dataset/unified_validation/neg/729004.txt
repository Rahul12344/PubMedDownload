steps processing ad2 mrna: poly(a)+ nuclear sequences conserved and
poly(a) addition precedes splicing.

nevins jr, darnell je jr.

the conservation nuclear ad2 sequences nucleocytoplasmic transport 
been estimated accumulation 3h-uridine nuclear cytoplasmic
ad2-specific rna major late transcription unit. 10-28% conserved
of total ad2 nuclear rna synthesized five regions genome 
that specify groups 3' co-terminal mrnas. sum conservation all
the regions equivalent 100%, signifying conservation least a
part transcript one fifth one sixth the
transcripts. conservation poly(a)+ ad2 nuclear rna 4 times
greater total ad2 nuclear rna, approaching 100% conservation poly(a)+ 
nuclear sequences. since mrna contains three "spliced" sequences are
probably encoded per transcript, data conservation ad2 
sequences suggest transcriptional event 16-99 transcription
unit gives rise one possible 13-14 mrna molecules destruction the
remainder transcribed rna. portion conserved resides next 
the region poly(a) added. three models choice of
poly(a) sites considered: termination poly(a) site, cleavage shortly 
after synthesis one sites transcription complete, and
cleavage completion transcription. first model ruled 
demonstration equimolar synthesis 16-99 region. second model is
strongly supported 3h-uridine label appears equally rapidly time
range 2-10 min five 3' poly(a) addition sites, whereas chain
completion cleavage would lead faster appearance label most
promoter-distal site. furthermore, briefly labeled rna molecules extending from
16 several poly(a) addition sites first poly(a)- terminated
3h-uridine-labeled molecules detected, demonstrating poly(a) addition
precedes splicing. choice mrna emerges transcriptional
event would appear depend upon first choosing one five 3' mrna ends
followed 5' splicing event.
