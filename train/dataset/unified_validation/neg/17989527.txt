purpose review: recent progress elucidating physiopathology x-linked
lymphoproliferative syndrome (xlp) raised novel important issues
regarding biology natural killer cells. review this
information discuss issues involved.
recent findings: xlp rare inherited immunodeficiency characterized high
susceptibility severe infection epstein-barr virus. mutations the
gene sh2d1a (or alternatively sap) underlie 80% familial xlp (xlp-1) cases.
recently remaining 20% familial xlp (xlp-2) cases shown harbor
mutations gene xiap (x-linked inhibitor apoptosis protein). sap
and xiap deficiencies associated defect development and/or
homeostasis natural killer cells.
summary: hypothesized susceptibility epstein-barr virus 
xlp might result defect natural killer cells. role these
cells viral infection unclear, several herpes viruses developed
strategies escape natural killer cells. discovery sap xiap
deficiency leads defect natural killer cells also shed light on
novel signaling pathways required natural killer cell development and/or
homeostasis.
