there present exactly 25 compounds formally approved for
the treatment retrovirus (that hiv) infections: seven nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis), one nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(ntrti), four non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis), 10
protease inhibitors (pis), one coreceptor inhibitor (cri), one fusion inhibitor
(fi) one integrase inhibitor (ini). compounds expected approved
for treatment hiv infections near future nnrti rilpivirine,
the cri vicriviroc ini elvitegravir. obtain synergistic activity,
enable lower dosage levels, thus minimizing toxic side effects, particularly 
to reduce risk drug resistance development, common wisdom dictates that
the hiv inhibitors used drug combination regimens. although, given
the number compounds available, drug combinations could concocted 
are uncountable, one triple-drug combination far formulated as
single pill taken orally daily, namely atripla containing ntrti
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, nrti emtricitabine nnrti efavirenz.
here, document approved compounds along hiv-active compounds 
and, first time, compounds whose principal activity hepatitis 
b virus. logic new division enzymatic similarity between
the reverse transcriptase hiv hepatitis b virus; strategies the
development antiviral agents combat much common.
