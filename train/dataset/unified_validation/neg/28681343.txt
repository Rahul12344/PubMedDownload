in absence effective prophylaxis treatment, therapeutic options in
hiv-positive patients progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) are
limited antiretroviral therapy: nevertheless, outcome poor. conducted 
retrospective study (2009-2015) describing outcome 25 hiv-positive
patients detectable cerebrospinal fluid jc virus dna: 14 probable pml 
while others evidence inflammatory central nervous system (cns) 
affecting disorders. former group, 6-month mortality 45.5% vs 21.4 
the latter one: survival higher previously described predictor of
poor outcome identified. two patients treated 5ht2-inhibitors survived. 
the contributing role jcv replication cns-affecting disorders needs
to assessed well benefits 5ht2-inhibitors hiv-positive
patients proven pml.
