human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) gag targeted plasma
membrane particle assembly release. htlv-1 gag targeting occurs is
not well understood. pppy ptap motifs previously shown be
involved htlv-1 particle release ptap playing subtle role virus
budding. l domains function interaction host cellular
proteins normally involved multivesicular body (mvb) morphogenesis. plasma
membrane pathway rather mvb pathway found primary pathway 
for htlv-1 particle release hela cells. intriguingly, disruption ptap
motif led defect targeting gag plasma membrane to
cd63-positive mvbs. particles particle buds observed associated
with mvbs electron microscopy, implying gag targeting mvb resulted
in particle budding. blocking clathrin-dependent endocytosis found to
influence localization htlv-1 gag ptap mutant, indicating gag not
reach mvbs clathrin-dependent endocytosis. observations imply
that interaction gag tsg101 required gag targeting 
the mvb. overexpression dynamitin p50 increased particle release, suggesting
that increase intracellular transport mvbs cell
periphery utilization dynein-dynactin motor complex. intriguingly, 
virus particle release mutant reduced 20-fold compared that
of wild type hela cells, marked contrast less-than-twofold 
defect observed particle production htlv-1 gag ptap mutant 293t
cells. results indicate role ptap motif l domain
function cell type dependent.
