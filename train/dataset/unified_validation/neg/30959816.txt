citrus yellow vein clearing virus newly accepted member genus
mandarivirus family alphaflexiviridae. triple gene block proteins
(tgbp1, tgbp2 tgbp3) encoded plant viruses family function on
facilitating virus movement. however, protein function citrus yellow vein 
clearing virus (cyvcv) never explored. here, showed yeast
two-hybrid (y2h) bimolecular fluorescence (bifc) assays coat protein
(cp), tgbp1 tgbp2 cyvcv self-interacting. cp also interacts with
all three tgb proteins, tgbp1 tgbp2 interact with
tgbp3. furthermore, viral cp colocalizes tgbp1 tgbp3 the
plasmodesmata (pd) epidermal cells nicotiana benthamiana leaves, tgbp1 
can translocate tgbp2 granular-like structures embedded within er networks
to pd. results suggest proteins could coexist pd of
epidermal cells n. benthamiana. using agrobacterium infiltration-mediated rna 
silencing assays, show cyvcv cp strong rna silencing suppressor
(rss) triggered positive-sense green fluorescent protein (gfp) rna. the
presented results provide insights revealing mechanism the
viral movement suppression rna silencing.
