the high incidence spontaneous cell lymphomas akr mice (affected by
sustained viremia) greatly reduced experimental manipulations including
thymus removal young age genetic manipulation changing fv-1 allele
that controls replication spread viruses (establishing congenic
akr.fv-1b mice). although cell lymphomagenesis prevented, mice
were shown carry endogenous ecotropic provirus-induced potential lymphoma
cells (plcs) dormant state. termination dormant state, leading to
a high incidence cd5+ igm+ b cell lymphomas, triggered interference
with cell functions (optimal effect observed following vivo administration
of anti-cd8 moab), administration cell growth factors injecting the
mcf-247 recombinant virus isolate (from akr origin) affects cell
functions. assumption plc dormant state maintained through
specific immunological mechanisms (involving cells antibodies recognizing
plcs) could substantiated experimentally. results present
studies suggest cells provide immunoregulatory signals factors that
contribute maintenance b cell lymphoma arrest and/or proliferation.
analysis cytokine levels produced splenocytes taken mice plc
dormancy breakdown indicated reduced levels il-2 il-4 marked
elevation il-1 il-6 associated termination dormant state. 
the effect il-1 il-6 terminating dormant state demonstrated 
injecting cytokines plc carriers, thymectomized 12-month-old akr mice,
yielding 80-85% cd5+ igm+ b cell lymphomas. role il-6 b cell lymphoma
proliferation also indicated mcf-247 mediated termination dormancy, 
inhibiting significantly effect via vivo administration anti il-6
moabs.
