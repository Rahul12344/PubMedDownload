background & aims: hepatitis c virus (hcv)-rna detection peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs) recovery hcv infection, type occult 
hcv infection although unclear viral persistence pbmcs affects
hcv-specific t-cell responses. aim study investigate if
cellular immune responses modified hcv persistence pbmcs.
methods: hcv-specific cd4(+) cd8(+) t-cell responses six hcv
peptides, situated within non-structural (ns) proteins ns3, ns4b ns5b,
were measured flow cytometry-through intracellular detection gamma
interferon (ifn-γ) interleukin 4 (il-4) cd69 expression- 27 sustained
virological responders (svr): 13 14 without occult hcv infection in
pbmcs, detected strand-specific real-time pcr. ten healthy individuals 14 
chronically infected patients viraemia, included controls.
results: svr without occult infection showed higher percentage activated
cd4(+) cells peptides belonging ns3 (p124, p153) ns5b (p257,
p294), activated cd8(+) cells ns3 (p124, p153, p158) ns5b-p294, as
well elevated percentage cd4(+) cells releasing ifn-γ + il-4 against
ns3-p153, cd8(+) cells ns3 (p124, p153). svr without occult
infection showed higher percentage activation release ifn-γ + il-4 by
both cell subpopulations two group controls, contrast svr 
occult infection.
conclusion: lower hcv-specific t-cell response found svr occult
infection indicates immune response may impaired virus
persists pbmcs.
