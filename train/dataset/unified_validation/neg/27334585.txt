congenital cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection leading cause mental
retardation deafness newborns. guinea pig small animal
model congenital cmv infection. novel cmv vaccine investigated an
intervention strategy congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (gpcmv)
infection. disabled infectious single-cycle (disc) vaccine strategy, a
gpcmv mutant virus used lacked ability express essential
capsid gene (the ul85 homolog gp85) except grown complementing cell
line. vaccinated animals, gp85 mutant virus (gp85 disc) induced an
antibody response important glycoprotein complexes considered neutralizing
target antigens (gb, gh/gl/go, gm/gn). vaccine also generated cell
response pp65 homolog (gp83), determined via newly established guinea
pig gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. congenital
infection protection study, gp85 disc-vaccinated animals nonvaccinated
control group challenged pregnancy wild-type gpcmv (10(5) pfu). 
the pregnant animals carried pups term, viral loads target organs
of pups analyzed. based live pup births vaccinated control
groups (94.1% versus 63.6%), vaccine successful reducing mortality (p 
= 0.0002). additionally, pups vaccinated group reduced cmv
transmission, 23.5% infected target organs versus 75.9% control
group. overall, preliminary studies indicate disc cmv vaccine
strategy ability induce immune response similar natural 
virus infection increased safety non-replication-competent
virus, makes approach attractive cmv vaccine strategy.importance:
congenital cmv infection leading cause mental retardation deafness in
newborns. effective vaccine cmv remains elusive goal despite over
50 years cmv research. guinea pig, placenta structure similar to
that humans, small animal model congenital cmv infection and
recapitulates disease symptoms (e.g., deafness) newborn pups. report, 
a novel vaccine strategy congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (gpcmv)
infection developed, characterized, tested efficacy. disabled
infectious single-cycle (disc) vaccine strategy induced neutralizing antibody
or cell response important target antigens. congenital infection
protection study, animals protected cmv comparison the
nonvaccinated group (52% reduction transmission). novel vaccine 
effective previously tested gb-based vaccines strategies
involving live virus vaccines. overall, disc vaccine safe promising 
approach congenital cmv infection.
