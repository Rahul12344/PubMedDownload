since 1970s, cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection associated with
atherosclerotic disease. however, exact contribution virus remains
uncertain. article describe direct indirect immune-mediated
effect virus disease process. eight-week-old apolipoprotein e
(apoe) knockout mice infected mouse cmv (mcmv) mock injected, and
they sacrificed 2 20 weeks post-injection (p.i.) study
atherosclerosis, vascular wall ifngamma tnfalpha expression mcmv spread. 
to study plasma ifngamma tnfalpha levels, blood collected 1, 2, 4 
6 days p.i. addition days sacrifice. plasma cytokine levels were
increased mcmv infection early time points decreased mock levels 
at 2 20 weeks p.i. 2 weeks p.i., aortic arch samples showed local
cytokine expression mcmv infection. number early atherosclerotic
lesions percentage mice containing early lesions increased 2
weeks p.i., 20 weeks p.i., mcmv-induced effect atherogenesis 
seen late lesions. conclusion, mcmv infection induces systemic immune
response reflecting indirect effect mcmv infection atherosclerosis in
addition local aortic immune response reflecting direct effect the
virus atherosclerotic process.
