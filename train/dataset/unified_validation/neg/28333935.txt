background: dengue virus (denv) activity reported dhaka, bangladesh
since early 1960s greatest burden dengue fever dengue
hemorrhagic fever cases observed 2000. since time, intensity of
dengue activity varied year year, determining factors
remained relatively unknown. light gaps knowledge, main
objectives study determine magnitude seroprevalence and
seroconversion among surveyed population, establish the
individual/household level risk factors presence denv antibodies among
all age groups target populations city dhaka.
methodology/principal findings: considering lack fine scale investigations
on factors driving dengue activity bangladesh, prospective cohort study 
involving serological surveys undertaken participant interviews and
blood donation across city dhaka 2012. study participants were
recruited 12 90 wards blood samples collected the
pre-monsoon (n = 1125) post-monsoon (n = 600) seasons 2012. findings
revealed seroprevalence pre-monsoon samples 80.0% (900/1125) 
while seropositivity pre-monsoon samples paired post-monsoon 
samples 83.3% (503/600). 97 paired samples negative the
pre-monsoon time point, 56 positive post-monsoon time point. this
resulted seroprevalence 93.2% (559/600) among individuals tested during
the post-monsoon period. seroprevalence trended higher age children
exhibiting lower seropositivity compared adults. results study 
also indicated denv strains flaviviruses circulating dhaka 
in 2012. multivariate analysis revealed age, possession indoor potted
plants, types mosquito control measures significant factors
associated denv seroprevalence; attendance public/mass gatherings, 
and use mosquito control measures significantly associated denv
seroconversion adjusting variables.
conclusions/significance: study suggests high level of
endemic dengue virus circulation city dhaka resulted in
significant denv seroprevalence among residents. seropositivity increased
with age, however, substantial proportion children risk denv
infections. serological analysis also documents considerable denv
seroconversion among study participants indicates large proportion
of population city dhaka newly exposed denv the
study period (pre-and post-monsoon 2012). high levels seroconversion suggest
that intense circulation denv 2012 may resulted 
in significant risk viral associated illness. findings study further
indicated home-based interventions, removing indoor potted plants
and increased bed net use, addition vector control measures public
parks, would reduce exposure denv decrease risk viral
associated disease.
