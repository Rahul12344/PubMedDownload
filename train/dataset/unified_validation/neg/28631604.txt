egress vaccinia virus host cell mediated the
microtubule-associated motor kinesin-1, three viral proteins, a36 the
f12/e2 complex, implicated process. deletion f12 expression 
causes severe reduction egress deletion a36 whether these
proteins involved different mechanisms kinesin-1
recruitment unknown. shown virus lacking proteins forms
a smaller plaque mutants lacking either gene alone, indicating non-redundant
functions. a36 links virions directly kinesin-1 also nucleates
actin polymerization propel surface virions away host cell. to
address relative importance functions virus spread, panel of
recombinant viruses constructed ability a36 bind kinesin-1
or nucleate actin polymerization abrogated individually together, in
the presence absence f12 expression. analysis viruses revealed
that presence f12 protein, loss kinesin-1 interaction made a
greater contribution plaque size formation actin tails.
however absence f12, ability a36 promote egress was
abrogated. therefore, ability a36 promote egress kinesin-1 is
reliant f12 protein.
