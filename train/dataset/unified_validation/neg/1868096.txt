bacteriophage t4 gene 32 protein (g32p) dna replication accessory protein
that binds single-stranded (ss) nucleic acids nonspecifically, independent of
nucleotide sequence. g32p contains 1 mol zn(ii)/mol protein monomer, 
can substituted co(ii), maintenance structure activity of
the molecule. co(ii) coordinated via approximately tetrahedral ligand
symmetry three cys sulfur atoms therefore exhibits intense s(-)----co(ii) 
ligand metal charge-transfer (lmct) transitions near ultraviolet
[giedroc, d. p., et al. (1986) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 83, 8452-8456]. a
series fluorescent 1,n6-ethenoadenosine (epsilon a)-containing
oligonucleotides conforming structure (5'----3') d[(tp)m epsilon

length (l) six eight nucleotides evaluated dynamics probes and
potential fluorescence energy transfer donors co(ii) mapping spatial
proximity (fixed) intrinsic metal ion variably positioned epsilon
a-base series protein-nucleic acid complexes. provide spectroscopic
evidence epsilon a-oligonucleotides bind g32p-(a + b) fixed
polarity phosphodiester chain. trp side chain(s) makes close approach to
a epsilon base positioned toward 3' end bound l = 8 oligonucleotide.
six oligonucleotides l = 8 = 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 investigated as
energy transfer donors co(ii) 0.1 nacl, ph 8.1, 25 degrees c upon binding
to co(ii)-substituted zn(ii) g32p-(a + b), i.e., presence absence
of energy acceptor, respectively. detectable quenching epsilon
a-fluorescence co(ii)-lmct acceptors found occur epsilon
a-oligonucleotide-protein complexes, yielding energy transfer efficiencies (e) of
0.43, 0.31, 0.26, 0.26, 0.28, 0.41 l = 8 = 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
epsilon a-oligonucleotides, respectively. two-dimensional distances r (in a) 
were found vary follows: d[epsilon a(pt)7] (m = 0), 16.0 (15.5-16.9); d[tp 
epsilon a(pt)6] (m = 1), 17.7 (16.9-19.1); d[(tp)3 epsilon a(pt)4] (m = 3), 20.7 
(19.5-22.1); d[(tp)5 epsilon a(pt)2] (m = 5), 20.5 (19.5-21.9); d[(tp)6 epsilon
