background/aims: micrornas (mirnas) known act oncogenes tumor
suppressors diverse cancers. although mir-10b oncogene implicated in
many tumors, role cervical cancer (cc) remains largely unclear. here, we
investigated function underlying mechanisms mir-10b human cc.
methods: quantitative rt-pcr used measure mir-10b expression cc and
normal tissues, association clinicopathologic features analyzed.
methylation cpg sites mir-10b promoter analyzed methylation
sequencing. cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion assays were
used elucidate biological effects mir-10b expression target 
gene assayed western blot.
results: mir-10b downregulated cc tissues compared normal tissues,
and less mir-10b expression associated larger tumors, vascular invasion 
and hpv-type 16 positivity. mir-10b expression decreased hela (hpv18-positive)
and siha (hpv16-positive) cells compared c-33a (hpv-negative), increased
after treatment 5-aza-cdr. methylation ratio site -797 mir-10b
promoter c-33a lower hela siha. analysis
indicates site -797 located within transcription factor ap-2a (tfap2a) 
binding element. functionally, overexpression mir-10b hela siha
suppressed cell proliferation, migration invasion, induced apoptosis 
mir-10b downregulation opposite effects. mechanistically, t-cell lymphoma
invasion metastasis 1 (tiam1) identified direct functional
target mir-10b.
conclusion: mir-10b acts tumor suppressor cc suppressing oncogenic
tiam1, expression may downregulated methylation tfap2a
binding element hpv.
