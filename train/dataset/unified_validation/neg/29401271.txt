background: understanding influenza virus transmission humans
and pigs limited.
methods: beginning 2015, used one health approach serial sampling 
prospectively study 299 swine workers 100 controls, 9000 pigs, 6
pig farm environments china influenza viruses (iavs) using molecular,
culture, immunological techniques. study participants closely monitored 
for influenza-like illness (ili) events.
results: upon enrollment, swine workers higher serum neutralizing antibody
titers swine h1n1 higher nasal wash total immunoglobulin (iga) 
specific iga titers swine h1n1 h3n2 viruses. period 12
months, iavs detected quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction 46 396 (11.6%) environmental swabs, 235 3300 (7.1%) pig oral
secretion, 23 396 (5.8%) water, 20 396 (5.1%) aerosol, 19 396 (4.8%)
fecal-slurry specimens. five 32 (15.6%) participants ili events had
nasopharyngeal swab specimens positive iav, 17 (53.1%)
demonstrated 4-fold rises neutralization titers swine virus.
reassorted eurasian avian-lineage h1n1, a(h1n1)pdm09-like, swine-lineage h3n2
viruses identified pig farms. a(h1n1)pdm09-like h1n1 viruses
identified swine nearly genetically identical human h1n1 viruses
isolated participants ili.
conclusions: considerable evidence a(h1n1)pdm09-like, swine-lineage 
h1n1, swine-lineage h3n2 viruses circulating, likely reassorting, likely 
crossing species within pig farms. data suggest stronger
surveillance novel influenza virus emergence within swine farms is
imperative.
