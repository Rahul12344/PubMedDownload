background: lookback considered human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is
detected repeat blood donor case immediately previous negative
donation donated infectious window period (iwp) assay(s)
produced false-negative result. hiv lookback investigations undertaken nhs
blood transplant welsh blood service october 1995 and
december 2008 described.
study design methods: investigations undertaken previous
negative donations 113 hiv-infected donors, including retrospective testing of
archive samples, tracing components, identification recipients were
offered hiv testing appropriate. data collated hiv seroconverters
and outcome lookback summarized.
results: two previous negative donations given introduction of
minipool nucleic acid testing (mp-nat) screening confirmed positive by
individual retrospective polymerase chain reaction (pcr) testing archive
specimen. red blood cell components transfused donations. one 
recipient died transfusion, alive tested hiv
positive. 23 (20%) donations previously testing negative mp-nat were
confirmed pcr negative individual testing archive specimen and
none tested recipients donations evidence of
transfusion-transmitted hiv.
conclusion: yield lookback low one positive recipient identified 
over 13 years surveillance: hiv transmission occurred window period
donation given introduction mp-nat screening would been
detected using current testing methods. current residual risk estimates the
united kingdom predict hiv lookback limited benefit, as
demonstrated data.
