the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) used analyse tissues paraffin
blocks liver needle biopsies retrospectively. biopsies 29 patients with
proven hbsag hbcag expression liver tissue 8 healthy volunteers
served positive (group 1) negative tissue controls (group 2),
respectively. compared 16 patients proven hbsag expression
in liver lack hbcag (group 3), 23 patients anti-hbc 
hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related marker (group 4) 21 patients liver 
disease without hbv markers tissue serum (group 5). pcr detected hbv
sequences cases positive control group 94% group 3, in
65% group 4, 71.4% group 5, whereas healthy volunteers were
negative. data show pcr able detect hbv-dna sequences virtually
all patients active viral antigen expression also high proportion
of hepatitic patients silent active hb may may show signs 
of contact hbv. thus, pcr hbv-dna paraffin sections might
become useful tool identifying patients carrying hbv-dna expressing
hbv antigens.
