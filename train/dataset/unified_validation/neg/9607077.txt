fifteen host-range (h) mutants cyanophage n-1 characterized with
reference efficiency plating, time appearance, morphology size
of plaques nostoc muscorum three phage-resistant (nm 1/n-1, nm 2/n-1
and nm 8/n-1) mutants. phage n-1 adsorb three
phage-resistant mutants, h mutants differed one having
lower higher adsorption rate constants n. muscorum phage-resistant
mutants. inability majority h mutants isolated nm 1/n-1 grow in
nm 8/n-1 shown due failure adsorption. h mutants also
differed one reversion (back mutation) frequencies. the
lethal doses (ld37) required kill 37% free phage particles after
uv-irradiation, heating ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) treatment greatly
varied. h mutants found considerably sensitive uv 
and thermic inactivation n-1 resistant edta. h
mutants except five unable multiply 40 degrees c. the
significance features discussed.
