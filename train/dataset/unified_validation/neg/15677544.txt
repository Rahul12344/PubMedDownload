aim: investigate role human papillomavirus (hpv) development 
bladder transitional cell carcinoma (tcc).
methods: seventy eight paraffin wax embedded tcc samples tested the
presence hpv two methods. first, immunohistochemistry carried using
a polyclonal antibody capable detecting capsid protein known
papillomaviruses. second method consensus gp5+/6+ primer mediated
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique, products analysed both
agarose gel electrophoresis enzyme immunoassay using type specific
oligonucleotide probes 10 different mucosal genotypes. exclude false
negative results poor quality dna extracted paraffin wax
embedded samples, series extended include 20 blocks 
the corresponding snap frozen unfixed tissue available.
results: two methods produced contrasting results, 47 78 samples 
positive hpv antigen none positive hpv dna. hpv dna detected 
in 20 additional paraffin wax embedded tccs 20 paired unfixed
samples. contrast, hpv dna amplified pcr six paraffin
wax embedded cervical carcinoma anogenital wart control samples.
conclusion: disparity two sets results probably caused by
false positives resulting non-specificity polyclonal antibody
used immunohistochemistry. results suggest hpv unlikely play
an aetiological role development bladder tcc.
