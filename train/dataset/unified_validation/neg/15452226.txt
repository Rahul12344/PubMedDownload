pleconaril broad-spectrum antirhinovirus antienterovirus compound that
binds hydrophobic pocket within viral protein 1, stabilizing capsid
and resulting inhibition cell attachment rna uncoating. when
crystals human rhinovirus 16 (hrv16) hrv14 incubated pleconaril, 
drug occupancy binding pocket lower pleconaril introduced 
during assembly prior crystallization. effect far marked hrv16
than hrv14 marked pleconaril compounds. these
observations consistent virus yield inhibition studies radiolabeled 
drug binding studies showing antiviral effect pleconaril against
hrv16 greater infectivity progeny virions parent input
viruses. data suggest drug integration binding pocket 
assembly, late stage virus replication, may contribute the
antiviral activity capsid binding compounds.
