between 1980 1983, 317 bone-marrow (bm) aspirates 63 cases burkitt's 
lymphoma (bl) studied in-vitro liquid culture monitoring system. bl 
cell lines obtained culture 14 15 patients cytologically
positive marrow. in-vitro monitoring system shown useful regardless
of epstein-barr virus (ebv) status, clinical status patients cytogenetic
anomalies (8 t(8;14) 2 t(8;22) 2 bm cytologically normal suspect,
i.e., less 5% bl cells, in-vitro monitoring system shown 
sensitive cytological examination 25 56 cases (44%). sensitivity
of test 1/100 000, i.e., 3 logs inferior level detection by
cytology. bm harvested patients complete remission two
months chemotherapy, marrow purging proved necessary (38/38 negative
cultures); 7/10 patients harvested purpose (no more
than 30% indication autologous bm transplantation). bm was
harvested relapse partial remission, purging procedure shown 
be necessary 9 16 cases (56%).
