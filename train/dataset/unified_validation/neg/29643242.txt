severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome (sfts) emerging infectious
disease caused tick-borne phlebovirus family bunyaviridae, sfts virus
(sftsv). wild-type type interferon (ifn-i) receptor 1-deficient (ifnar1-/-)
mice established nonlethal lethal models sftsv infection,
respectively. however, mechanisms ifn-i production vivo factors
causing lethal disease well understood. using bone marrow-chimeric
mice, found ifn-i signaling hematopoietic cells essential for
survival lethal sftsv infection. disruption ifn-i signaling in
hematopoietic cells allowed increase viral loads serum produced an
excess multiple inflammatory cytokines chemokines. production ifn-i
and inflammatory cytokines abolished deletion signaling molecules
ips-1 myd88, essential retinoic acid-inducible gene (rig-i)-like
receptor (rlr) toll-like receptor (tlr) signaling, respectively. however,
ips-1-/- myd88-/- mice exhibited resistance lethal sfts moderate viral 
load serum. taken together, results indicate adequate activation of
rlr tlr signaling pathways low moderate levels viremia
contributed survival ifn-i-dependent antiviral response during
sftsv infection, whereas overactivation signaling pathways high
levels viremia resulted abnormal induction multiple inflammatory
cytokines chemokines, causing lethal disease.importance sftsv causes a
severe infectious disease humans, high fatality rate 12 30%. to
know pathogenesis virus, need clarify innate immune response
as front line defense viral infection. here, report lethal
animal model showed abnormal induction multiple inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines uncontrolled innate immune response, triggered lethal 
sfts. findings suggest new strategy target inflammatory humoral factors 
to treat patients severe sfts. furthermore, study may help the
investigation tick-borne viruses.
