twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers immunized intranasally an
inactivated whole-virus influenza vaccine based strain a/new
caledonia/20/99 (h1n1), either saline mixed formaldehyde-inactivated
bordetella pertussis mucosal adjuvant, thixotropic vehicle with
mucoadhesive properties. four doses, groups vaccinees developed
significant igg- iga-antibody responses, measured elisa, respectively
serum nasal secretions. none volunteers demonstrable
hemagglutination inhibition (hai) antibodies serum immunized,
whereas 80% reached hai titers>or=40, considered protective,
after immunizations. addition, cellular immune responses, measured as
significant increases cd4+ t-cell proliferation granzyme b-producing
cytotoxic t-cells, detected vaccine strain well against
heterologous virus strains (h3n2). however, additive effect responses
could demonstrated use b. pertussis thixotropic substance in
the present vaccines. appeared, actually, mucoadhesive vehicle
containing thixotropic substance less efficient two other
formulations. influenza vaccine made simple particulate formulation of
inactivated virus, given repeatedly onto nasal mucosa, may thus an
attractive alternative currently available vaccines.
