three criteria appropriate host cell chosen expression of
a recombinant-derived vaccine antigen efficacy, safety, scale-up.
efficacy vaccine antigen refers ability host cell produce 
a vaccine antigen capable eliciting protective immune response. concern
for safety vaccine antigen relates residual dna final product,
especially derived continuous mammalian cell lines opposed to
microbial cells. since tens (or hundreds) millions doses widely used
vaccine might injected healthy infants young children the
lifetime product, safety critical issue, use a
microbial expression system might preferable use continuous cell
line certain circumstances.
