influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha)-mediated membrane fusion involves insertion
into target membranes stretch amino acids located n-terminus of
the ha(2) subunit ha low ph. pk(a) alpha-amino group (1)gly
of fusion peptide measured using (15)n nmr. pk(a) group was
found 8.69 presence dopc
(1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). high value pk(a) is
indicative stabilization protonated form amine group through
noncovalent interactions. shift reagent pr(3+) large effects (15)n
resonance alpha-amino group gly(1) fusion peptide dopc
vesicles, indicating terminal amino group exposed bulk
solvent, even low ph. furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance studies 
the fusion peptide region spin-labeled derivatives larger ha construct
are consistent n-terminus peptide depth the
phosphate headgroups. conclude neutral acidic ph, the
n-terminal fusion peptide close aqueous phase protonated.
thus neither change state ionization significant increase in
membrane insertion group associated increased fusogenicity low
ph.
