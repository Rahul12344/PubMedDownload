in studies, identified dna sequences specific protein
interactions necessary transcriptional regulation human prointerleukin
1 beta (proil-1 beta) gene. cell-type-independent lipopolysaccharide
(lps)-responsive enhancer element located -3757 -2729 bp upstream
from transcription start site (cap site) consisted least six discrete
subregions essential maximal induction lps transfected
monocytes. enhancer also appeared mediate phorbol myristate acetate
induction monocytes il-1 responsiveness fibroblasts. deletion base 
substitution mutations along dna binding studies demonstrated the
enhancer contained minimum three functional protein binding sequences, two
of appeared important gene induction. one essential

c/ebp family transcription factors required il-1- lps-specific
induction il-6 gene (i.e., nf-il6 proteins). ligated the
proil-1 beta cap site-proximal region (located -131 +12), the
proil-1 beta simian virus 40 enhancer elements functioned more
efficiently monocytes hela cells, normally competent for
il-1 beta expression. ligated murine c-fos promoter, however, the
proil-1 beta enhancer inducible phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated hela 
cells, suggesting existence proil-1 beta promoter-proximal requirement
for tissue specificity.
