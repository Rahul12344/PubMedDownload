to investigate role viral expression individuals infected human
t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1), real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) htlv-1 tax messenger rna
(mrna) using abi prism 7700 sequence detection system developed. using this
system, htlv-1 tax mrna load compared htlv-1 proviral dna load,
htlv-1 tax protein expression, htlv-1 tax-specific cd8(+) t-cell frequency, and
disease severity htlv-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis
(ham/tsp). approach sensitive specific technique precise
quantification htlv-1 tax mrna. total amount htlv-1 tax mrna mrna
expression level htlv-1-infected cells (mrna/dna ratio) higher ham/tsp
patients asymptomatic htlv-1 carriers. htlv-1 tax mrna load
correlated htlv-1 proviral dna load ex vivo, tax protein expression 
in vitro, tax-specific cd8(+) t-cell frequency ex vivo. htlv-1 tax
mrna load also correlated disease severity ham/tsp patients. data
suggest increased htlv-1 expression plays important role the
pathogenesis ham/tsp, htlv-1 tax mrna level could useful
predictor disease progression patients ham/tsp.
