distribution according water supply. prior epidemic, 
operational breakdown water treatment plant distributed water the
affected areas transforming purification system slow sand rapid
sand filtration. primary source water plant derived a
heavily contaminated stream. highest ar (16.3%) observed areas
where source drinking water exclusively purification plant,
followed ars 12.4% 5.3% receiving 50% 30% less of
