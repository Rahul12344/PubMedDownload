most low-pathogenicity avian influenza (lpai) viruses cause mild disease in
avian species. little known mechanisms host defence the
immune responses avian influenza-infected birds. study showed that
chicken macrophages susceptible infection lpai h9n2 h6n2 viruses 
and infection led apoptosis. h9n2 virus-infected chicken macrophages, 
toll-like receptor 7 responded infection mediated cytokine responses. 
whilst pro-inflammatory cytokines largely upregulated, interferon (ifn) 
response fairly weak ifn-inducible genes differentially regulated.
among regulated genes, major histocompatibility complex (mhc) antigens ii
were downregulated, also occurred lungs h9n2-infected chickens.
additionally, interleukin (il)-4, il-4 receptor cd74 (mhc class ii invariable
chain) also downregulated, pivotal activation of
cd4+ helper cells humoral immunity. remarkably, h9n2 virus-infected
chickens, antibody response severely suppressed. contrast 
the robust antibody response chickens infected h6n2 virus, which
expression mhc class ii antigens upregulated. data suggest that
neutralizing antibodies humoral immunity may developed efficiently 
h9n2-infected chickens. findings raise questions lpai
viruses differentially regulate avian immune responses whether have
similar effects mammalian immune function.
