when injected immunosome presentation (molecules anchored preformed
liposome), rabies glycoprotein (gp) capable protecting animals against
rabies either viral infection. presentation gp
molecules correct form seems essential induction of
antirabies protection. condition must taken account making-up
of rabies subunit vaccine. order study relationship the
immune responses induced rabies gp protective activity, different 
presentations gp prepared. purified glycoprotein molecules were
associated different physical forms: liposome-anchored, self-aggregated
(rosettes) associated viral lipids (virosomes). presentations 
appeared different electron microscopy. also exhibited differences the
expression immunodominant epitope protective activity. the
non-specific immune response, appraised interferon production natural
cytotoxicity, induced high level purified viral particles.
specific immune responses (namely virus neutralizing antibody interleukin-2
production) induced high levels viral particle the
liposome-anchored glycoprotein. parallelism previously established
between protection glycoprotein preparations interleukin-2 production in
primed mice splenocytes. suggests measure interleukin-2
production vitro could used evaluate capability rabies antigen 
to induce t-cell response confer protection.
