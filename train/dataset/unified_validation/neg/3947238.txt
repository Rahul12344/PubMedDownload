comparative studies undertaken h3n2 influenza virus strains
isolated leningrad may-june, 1982 isolated subsequent
winter epidemic february, 1983. analysis isolates ferret antisera 
against standard influenza viruses h3n2 subtype monoclonal
antibodies a/bangkok/1/79 virus revealed considerable similar
degree heterogeneity ha antigenic specificity strains isolated
in spring-summer, 1982, winter, 1983, periods also close
resemblance antigenic specificities strains two
epidemics. however comparative genome analysis strains using crna:vrna
hybridization technique revealed terms gene homology, the
influenza virus strains circulated spring-summer period 1982
resembled strains responsible previous rather subsequent
epidemic.
