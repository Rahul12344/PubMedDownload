proper sampling essential characterize molecular epidemiology human 
immunodeficiency virus (hiv). hiv sampling frames difficult identify, so
most studies use convenience samples. discuss statistically valid feasible
sampling techniques overcome potential bias due to
convenience sampling ensure better representation study population. we
employ sampling design called stratified cluster sampling. first divides
the population geographical and/or social strata. within stratum, a
population clusters chosen groups, locations, facilities where
hiv-positive individuals might found. clusters randomly selected
within strata individuals randomly selected within clusters. variation
and cost help determine number clusters number individuals
within clusters sampled. illustrate approach a
study designed survey heterogeneity subtype b strains honduras.
