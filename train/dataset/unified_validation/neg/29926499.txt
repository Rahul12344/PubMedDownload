periodontal health defined absence clinically detectable inflammation.
there biological level immune surveillance consistent with
clinical gingival health homeostasis. clinical gingival health may found
in periodontium intact, i.e. without clinical attachment loss bone
loss, reduced periodontium either non-periodontitis patient (e.g.
in patients form gingival recession following crown lengthening
surgery) patient history periodontitis currently
periodontally stable. clinical gingival health restored following
treatment gingivitis periodontitis. however, treated stable
periodontitis patient current gingival health remains increased risk of
recurrent periodontitis, accordingly, must closely monitored. two broad
categories gingival diseases include non-dental plaque biofilm-induced
gingival diseases dental plaque-induced gingivitis. non-dental plaque
biofilm-induced gingival diseases include variety conditions not
caused plaque usually resolve following plaque removal. such
lesions may manifestations systemic condition may localized 
oral cavity. dental plaque-induced gingivitis variety clinical signs and
symptoms, local predisposing factors systemic modifying factors 
affect extent, severity, progression. dental plaque-induced gingivitis
may arise intact periodontium reduced periodontium either a
non-periodontitis patient currently stable "periodontitis patient" i.e.
successfully treated, clinical inflammation eliminated (or
substantially reduced). periodontitis patient gingival inflammation
remains periodontitis patient (figure 1), comprehensive risk assessment and
management imperative ensure early prevention and/or treatment of
recurrent/progressive periodontitis. precision dental medicine defines a
patient-centered approach care, therefore, creates differences way 
in "case" gingival health gingivitis defined clinical
practice opposed epidemiologically population prevalence surveys. thus, 
case definitions gingival health gingivitis presented both
purposes. gingival health gingivitis many clinical features, case 
definitions primarily predicated presence absence bleeding on
probing. classify gingival health gingival diseases/conditions, along
with summary table diagnostic features defining health gingivitis in
various clinical situations.
