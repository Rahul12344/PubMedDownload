infectious bronchitis (ib) acute highly contagious chicken viral
disease, causing severe economic losses poultry producers worldwide. the
last decades, infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) extensively studied,
but knowledge immune responses virulent vaccine strains ibvs remains 
limited. review focuses fundamental aspects immune responses against
ibv, including role pattern recognition receptors (prrs) identification
of conserved viral structures role different components innate
immunity (e.g., heterophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, acute phase protein,
and cytokines). studies adaptive immune activation role humoral and
cellular immunity ibv clearance also reviewed. multiple interlinking
immune responses essential protection virulent ibvs, including
passive, innate, adaptive, effector cells active mucosal surfaces.
although development approaches chicken transcriptome proteome
analyses greatly helped understanding underlying genetic
mechanisms immunity, still major knowledge gaps, role
of mucosal cellular responses ibvs. view recent reports emergent 
ibv variants many countries, renewed interest complete
understanding poultry immune responses virulent vaccine strains of
ibvs. critical developing new vaccine vaccination strategies 
and intervention programs.
