multiple nucleoside resistance involves specific genetic changes hiv-1
reverse transcriptase gene, q151m mutation insertion two serine
aminoacids rt codon 69. among 432 patients failing antiretroviral therapy,
five (1.15%) harboured viruses q151m mutation rt gene no
viruses identified harbouring insertion codon 69. also studied
the long-term benefit hiv genotypic testing failure reach viral 
load 50 copies/ml within 1 year antiretroviral therapy using the
primary end-point. group 64 hiv-positive antiretroviral multiexperienced
patients examined, failing current art. hiv-rna changed -0.8
log month 4 +0.1 log -0.5 log months 8 12, respectively. the
proportion patients viral load 50 copies/ml 19.3, 32.8, and
28.1% months 4, 8, 12, respectively. multidrug-experienced patients,
genotype-guided therapy fact able achieve complete viral suppression
in 30% patients 1 year art. development precise
resistance tests interpretations needed better control hiv
replication. metabolic/pharmacokinetics factors poor drug adherence
should also assessed.
