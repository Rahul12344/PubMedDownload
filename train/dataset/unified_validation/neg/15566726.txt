the objective examine antibody responses influenza immunization 
an elderly population effect prophylactic acetaminophen adverse
responses due inactivated whole virus vaccine containing influenza (h3n2 and
h1n1) b antigens. autumn 1990, 100 patients 65 years older
were immunized randomly allocated receive placebo 1,950 mg (2 x 975 mg)
of acetaminophen. recorded local systemic side effects 3-day 
period. serology performed pre- post (4-6 weeks) -vaccination sera.
age gender distribution study were: 47% 75 years older,
and 61% patients female. patients (97%) pre-existing 
antibodies influenza b. average peak preimmunization antibody titers were
40 b yamagata taiwan (h1n1) 80 shanghai (h3n2). half each
treatment group 4-fold greater rise antibody titer response the
vaccine. 30% patients immunized previous year 80% never 
vaccinated previously demonstrated 4-fold greater serological response to
the vaccine. however, measurement protection rates (hi >/= 40) and
after vaccination indicated 81.1-100% protection 3 viruses influenced
by treatment, gender history previous vaccination. treatment groups 
had equally small numbers patients recorded systemic symptoms of
drowsiness, myalgia, fever chills 50% arm soreness. although
about 80% previously unimmunized adults mounted 4-fold antibody rise to
influenza vaccine antigens whereas booster effects seen 30% those
immunized previous year, protection rates high (81-100%) after
immunization affected acetaminophen treatment. adverse effects
(15% systemic 50% local) ameliorated 1950 mg acetaminophen 
these elderly patients.
