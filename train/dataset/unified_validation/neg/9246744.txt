the cost protein (cp) genes two potato virus necrotic isolates (n27 a
mutant strain n27-92), differed reactivity monoclonal
antibody (mab), characterized. isolates could detected mab 4e7,
but mab vn295.5 selectively reacted n27 n27-92. cp genes of
both isolates coded 267 amino acids approximately 99.0% identity both
the nucleotide amino acid levels. nucleotide sequence comparison
indicated five substitutions n27-92 compared n27. three changes 
resulted substitution amino acids. two transitions (a-->g) n27-92
changed threonine alanine lysine arginine positions 7 55,
respectively, whereas a-->t transversion changed asparagine isoleucine at
positions 27. surface probability curves isolates could almost be
superimposed, except amino acid positions 7 27. since amino acid
substitution position 55 conservative, changes polar hydrophobic
amino acids (threonine-->alanine asparagine-->isoleucine) positions 7 
27 might changed epitope(s) n27-92, abolishing detection mab
vn295.5.
