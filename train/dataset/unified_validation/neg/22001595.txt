the frequent outbreak influenza pandemic limited available
anti-influenza drugs highlight urgent need development new
antiviral drugs. dsrna-binding surface nonstructural protein 1 of
influenza virus (ns1a) promising target. detailed understanding of
ns1a-dsrna interaction valuable structure-based anti-influenza drug
discovery. characterize explore key interaction features dsrna
and ns1a, molecular dynamics simulation combined mm-gbsa calculations were
performed. based mm-gbsa calculations, find intermolecular van
der waals interaction nonpolar solvation term provide main driving
force binding process. meanwhile, 17 key residues ns1a were
identified responsible dsrna binding. compared wild type
ns1a, studied mutants s42a, t49a, r38a, r35ar46a obvious reduced
binding free energies dsrna reflecting reduction polar and/or 
nonpolar interactions. addition, structural energy analysis indicate
the mutations small effect backbone structures loss side
chain interactions responsible decrease binding affinity. the
uncovering ns1a-dsrna recognition mechanism provide useful insights 
and new chances development anti-influenza drugs.
