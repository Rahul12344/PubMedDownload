infection human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) associated severe
diseases immunologically impaired patients. cytomegalovirus hepatitis been
frequently described population, diagnosis still difficult.
molecular hybridization v ecori restriction fragment human
cytomegalovirus strain ad 169 tested upon dna extracted liver
samples assess usefulness technique cytomegalovirus hepatitis 
diagnosis. probe shown southern technique hybridize with
dna extracted cells infected herpesviruses dna of
non-infected normal liver. sensitivity estimated 2 x 10(5) genomes.
twenty-five renal transplant recipients immunosuppressive therapy three
patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome studied. 9 
10 renal transplant recipients normal liver, previous exposure to
cytomegalovirus, defined serological tests, sufficient allow
positive detection probe. 11 patients abnormal liver,
cytomegalovirus dna sequences shown 5. 2 patients histological
evidence cytomegalovirus hepatitis, strong signal showed presence
of viral genomes. results show southern technique v ecori
probe useful diagnosis hcmv hepatitis might proposed for
the detection viral genome human tissues.
