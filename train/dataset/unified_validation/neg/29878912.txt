purpose review: clinical trials antiretroviral therapy (art)
interruption remains indispensable assessing strategies art-free hiv
remission. review highlights lessons learned art interruption
studies far, including risks participants implications hiv 
remission.
recent findings: historically, analytic hiv treatment interruption (ati) studies 
were commonly designed prolonged duration art interruption with
viral load set point primary outcome. variety reasons, including 
participant risk, recent treatment interruption trials frequently used time 
to viral rebound primary endpoint restarted art a
predetermined viral load threshold reached. treatment interruption
trials, investigators tested efficacy therapeutic curative
strategies showed promise preclinical trials, including therapeutic
vaccines, latency-reversing agents, broadly neutralizing antibodies. 
populations, ati trials well tolerated, adverse clinical
events significant changes reservoir. several reservoir predictors 
of hiv-rebound timing reported, subset trials uncovering
posttreatment controllers maintain hiv remission despite art
discontinuation.
summary: treatment interruption trials vital tool, optimal design
remain uncertain must balance participant risks scientific rigor. the
ability predict timing extent hiv rebound identify mechanisms of
posttreatment control may accelerate development novel therapeutics for
sustained hiv remission.
