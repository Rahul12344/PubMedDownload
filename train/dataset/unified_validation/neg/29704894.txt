background: duck enteritis virus (dev) belongs family herpesviridae is
an important epornitic agent causes economic losses waterfowl
industry. chinese virulent (chv) attenuate vaccines (vac) two
different pathogenic dev strains. micrornas (mirnas) class non-coding
rnas regulate gene expression viral infection. nonetheless, is
little information virulent duck enteritis virus (dev)-encoded mirnas.
results: using high-throughput sequencing, identified 39 mature viral mirnas
from chv-infected duck embryo fibroblasts cells. compared reported 33
vac-encoded mirnas, 13 mirna sequences 22 "seed sequences" mirna were
identical, 8 novel viral mirnas detected confirmed stem-loop
rt-qpcr study. using rnahybrid pita software, 38 chv-encoded mirnas
were predicted target 41 viral genes formed complex regulatory network. 
dual luciferase reporter assay (dlra) confirmed viral dev-mir-d8-3p can
directly target 3'-utr chv us1 gene (p < 0.05). gene ontology analysis 
host target genes viral mirnas mainly involved biological regulation, 
cellular metabolic processes. addition, 598 novel duck-encoded mirnas were
detected study. thirty-eight host mirnas showed significant differential 
expression chv infection: 13 mirnas up-regulated, 25 mirnas were
down-regulated, may affect viral replication host cell.
conclusions: data suggested chv encoded different set micrornas
and formed unique regulatory network compared vac. first
report def mirnas expression profile analysis mirnas
regulatory mechanisms dev infection. data provide basis for
further exploring mirna regulatory roles pathogenesis dev infection and
contribute understanding chv-host interaction mirna level.
