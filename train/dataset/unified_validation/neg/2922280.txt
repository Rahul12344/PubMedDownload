human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) leader rna, contains double-stranded
regions due inverted repeats, shown activate dsrna-dependent
enzymes associated interferon system. hiv-1 leader rna produced vitro
using sp6 rna polymerase characterized using probes antisense and
sense-strand rna. rna preparation free significant levels of
antisense rna. hiv-1 leader rna shown activate dsrna-dependent protein
kinase cell-free system interferon-treated hela cells. affinity resins,
consisting hiv-1 leader rna covalently attached cellulose, immobilized 
activated dsrna-dependent protein kinase 2-5a-synthetase. hiv-1 leader rna,
therefore, may contributing factor mechanism interferon
inhibits hiv replication.
