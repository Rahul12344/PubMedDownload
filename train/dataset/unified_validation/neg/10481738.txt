among many mutational "hot spots" hepatitis b virus (hbv) genome, a-to-t1762
and g-to-a1764 within core promoter underscored view disease 
association well viral expression/replication. although lesser extent,
c-to-t1653 t-to-v(c/a/g)1753 also noteworthy previous study. to
assess clinical significance mutations, determined nucleotide
sequence hbv dna fragment covering sites hbsag-positive blood
donors (n = 160) patients chronic hepatitis (n = 66), liver cirrhosis (n
= 45), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 58), infected with
genotype c hbv (subtype adr). cases hbe antigen positive, the
frequency t1653 and/or v1753 showed striking increment chronic
hepatitis patients (18%) liver cirrhosis and/or hepatoma patients (82%),
whereas t1762/a1764 already high chronic hepatitis patients (76%).
in hbe antigen-negative cases, contrast, significant difference the
frequency t1653/v1753 mutants found blood donors (22%) chronic
hepatitis patients (67%). results suggest t1653/v(particularly c)1753
mutants closely associated t1762/a1764 progression of
liver disease chronic hepatitis cirrhosis hbe antigen-positive
patients. system site-directed mutagenesis pcr rflp constructed to
diagnose t1653 c/a1753 conveniently. detecting t1653 c/a1753 this
method would contribute differential diagnosis hbv-associated liver
disease.
