to investigate duration fecal shedding changing loads hepatitis e
virus (hev) feces serum patients acute hev infection, hev rna
was quantitated periodic serum fecal specimens obtained 11 patients
with sporadic acute hepatitis e. 11 patients detectable hev rna serum 
at admission, highest viral load 1.9 x 10(3) 1.7 x 10(7)
copies/ml, hev viremia lasted days 17 48 (mean, 28.3) the
onset hepatitis. even initial examination days 10 29 (mean,
17.6), hev load fecal supernatant less 5.7 x 10(4) copies/ml 
10 11 patients, remaining patient (patient 1) was
markedly high, 2.0 x 10(7) copies/ml day 22. addition, although hev rna 
fecal supernatant continued positive days 14 33 (mean, 22.4) for
patients 2 11, patient 1 detectable even day 121. hevs in
fecal specimens obtained days 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, day 121, from
patient 1 grew efficiently plc/prf/5 cells, reaching highest titer up
to 10(7) copies/ml culture medium day 50 postinoculation. hev genome
recovered patient 1 29 unique nucleotides seen of
the 25 reported hev isolates genotype entire genome, with
six amino acid substitutions orf1 protein.
