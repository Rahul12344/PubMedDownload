background: hepatitis c virus infects ~3% population risk
factor hepatocarcinogenesis. epigenetic mechanisms hcv-induced
hepatocyte transformation towards malignancy context unclear.
aims: purpose study evaluate effect hcv core proteins
of different genotypes dna methyltransferases (dnmts) induction.
materials/methods: investigated dnmt1, dnmt3b e-cadherin (cdh1) mrna and
protein expression levels vitro model huh-7 cells expressing hcv 
core protein different genotypes: 1b, 2a, 3a, 4h 5a.
results: found mrna protein expression levels dnmt1 3b
were upregulated genotype 1b hcv core expressing cells compared control 
cells. dnmt3b mrna levels change genotypes 2a, 3a, 4h 5a, were
upregulated protein level genotype 1b, 2a, 3a. cdh1 mrna expression was
downregulated genotype 1b, whereas protein expression resulted in
downregulation hcv core genotypes 1b, 2a 3a. conversely, no
significant changes observed dnmts cdh1 investigated huh-7 cells 
expressing genotypes 4h 5a. furthermore, present evidence hcv
core 1b protein expression induces dnmts overexpression stat3 protein 
demonstrated nsc74859 treatment. moreover, sirt1 inhibition affected dnmt1 and
3b expression hcv core protein genotype 1b expressing cells as
demonstrated treatment inhibitor sirtinol.
conclusions: findings suggest hcv core protein could play role hcc 
development least part altering dnmts expression.
