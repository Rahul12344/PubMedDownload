the unfolded protein response (upr) cellular mechanism triggered 
order cope stress caused accumulation misfolded proteins in
the endoplasmic reticulum (er). response initiated the
endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (ire1), activating transcription
factor 6 (atf6), pkr-like er kinase, increase expression the
genes involved folding degradation processes decrease protein 
input er inhibiting translation. shown viruses 
induce manipulate upr order protect host cells er
stress-mediated death, thus permitting translation viral proteins 
efficient replication virus. understand cellular events occur 
during rotavirus replication cycle, examined activation three
upr arms following infection, using luciferase reporters driven promoters of
the er stress-responsive genes real-time reverse transcription-pcr to
determine levels stress-induced mrnas. findings indicated that
during rotavirus infection two three arms upr (ire1 atf6)
become activated; however, pathways interrupted translational
level general inhibition protein synthesis caused nsp3. this
response seems triggered one viral protein synthesized 
the replication virus, viral double-stranded rna (dsrna),
since cells transfected psoralen-inactivated virions, naked viral
dsrna, induce upr.
