thymus bone marrow cells virus-infected mice investigated.
sensitivity virus-induced t-cell lymphomagenesis shown involve early
occurrence thy-positive plc, found predominantly among thymocytes, whereas
resistance rather related early identification plc-thy-negative cells
mostly among bone marrow cells. plc characterized sensitive
(bl/6 + a-radlv) resistant (bl/6 + d-radlv) situations testing parallel

thymus bone marrow cell populations separated different methods as
size fractionation centrifugal elutriation, cytotoxic elimination of
lymphocytes, panning. early occurring plc among thymocytes bl/6 mice
10-20 days following infection a-radlv shown cortisone-resistant,
thy+, cd4+, and/or cd8+ medium size dividing thymocytes. plc among thymocytes 
bl/6 mice + d-radlv, identified among medium large cell fractions, were
shown cortisone-resistant thy-, cd4-cd8- lymphocytes. high tumorigenic
potential plc demonstrated among unseparated separated (on size
basis) bone marrow cells bl/6 + d-radlv (72-84%), whereas unseparated or
separated fractions bone marrow bl/6 + a-radlv low lymphomagenic
