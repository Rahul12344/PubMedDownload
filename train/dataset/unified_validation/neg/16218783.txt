baculoviral vectors transduce neurons cns mediate transient
expression transgenes. developed new baculoviral vector the
inverted terminal repeats (itrs) adeno-associated virus used flank a
luciferase reporter gene cassette harboring neuron-specific promoter. when
tested rat brain, new viral vector able provide transgene
expression least 90 days. immunohistological analysis demonstrated that
itr flanking affect cellular preference neuronal promoter in
the context baculovirus. findings establish effective way engineer
baculoviral vectors order achieve sustained expression functional gene
for gene therapy neurodegenerative disorders physiological studies of
neurons.
