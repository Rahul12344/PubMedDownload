monitoring genetically altered cells important component adoptive t
cell therapy patients, ability visualize their
trafficking/targeting, proliferation/expansion, retention/death using highly 
sensitive reporter systems induce immunologic response would
provide useful information. therefore, focused human reporter gene systems 
that potential translation clinical studies. objective the
in vivo imaging studies determine minimum number cells could
be visualized different nuclear reporter systems. determined the
imaging sensitivity (lower limit cell detection) reporter using
appropriate radiolabeled probes pet spect imaging.methods: human cells
were transduced retroviral vectors encoding human norepinephrine
transporter (hnet), human sodium-iodide symporter (hnis), human deoxycytidine
kinase double mutant (hdckdm), herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase
(hsvtk) reporter genes. viability growth assessed, 10(5) 3 ×
10(6) reporter cells injected subcutaneously shoulder area. the
corresponding radiolabeled probe injected intravenously 30 min later,
followed sequential pet spect imaging. radioactivity cell
injection sites thigh (background) measured.
results: viability growth experimental cells unaffected by
transduction. hnet/meta-(18)f-fluorobenzylguanidine ((18)f-mfbg) reporter
system could detect less 1 × 10(5) cells high uptake the
transduced cells low background activity. hnis/(124)i-iodide reporter
system could detect approximately 1 × 10(6) cells; (124)i-iodide uptake 
t cell injection site time-dependent associated high background. the
hdckdm/2'-(18)f-fluoro-5-ethyl-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyluracil ((18)f-feau) and
hsvtk/(18)f-feau reporter systems detected approximately 3 × 10(5) cells,
respectively. (18)f-feau efficient probe (higher uptake, lower
background) (124)i-1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil
for hdckdm hsvtk.
conclusion: comparison different reporter gene-reporter probe systems for
imaging cell number performed, hnet/(18)f-mfbg pet reporter
system found sensitive capable detecting approximately 
35-40 × 10(3) cells site cell injection animal model.
