infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) responsible highly contagious
infectious bursal disease chickens. previously, blind passage, vvibdv gx 
strain attenuated gt strain, strain cef-9 intermediate
characters obtained attenuation. since cef-9 exhibited two
interesting amino acid mutations (q253h a284t) loops p(de) p(fg) at
the tip vp2 spikes, hypothesized that, either function separately in
combination, define cell tropism virulence vvibdv. test this
hypothesis, q253h a284t introduced individually combination into
vp2 gx gt strain obtain six modified clones. using reverse genetics,
combined mutations q253h a284t could adapt vvibdv non-permissive cef
cells (rgx-f9vp2) single mutation could not. vivo, rgx-f9vp2 not
cause mortality gx strain induced 66.7% mortality. dual evidence from
natural rescued strains identified cell tropism vvibdv cef
cells determined combined vp2 mutations q253h a284t, by
single mutation. two residues mainly responsible virulence of
vvibdv. findings may helpful design new tailored ibdv
vaccines.
