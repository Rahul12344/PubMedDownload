tobacco viruses including tobacco mosaic virus (tmv), cucumber mosaic virus
(cmv), tobacco etch virus (tev), potato virus (pvy) tobacco vein banding
mosaic virus (tvbmv) major viruses infecting tobacco cause serious
crop losses. multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay
was developed detect simultaneously differentiate five viruses. the
system used specific primer sets virus producing five distinct fragments
237, 273, 347, 456 547 bp, representing tmv, cmv subgroup i, tev, pvy(o) 
tvbmv, respectively. primers used detection different
viruses single pcr multiplex pcr results confirmed dna
sequencing analysis. protocol used detect viruses different parts
of china. simultaneous sensitive detection different viruses using the
multiplex pcr efficient economical conventional methods
for tobacco virus detection. multiplex pcr provides rapid reliable
method detection identification major tobacco viruses, be
useful epidemiological studies.
