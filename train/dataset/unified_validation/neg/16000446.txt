plaque assays titrating dengue virus (denv) time-consuming not
suitable strains plaque. fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(facs) used detect denv-infected cells. describe facs-based
assay titrating denv. determined 24 h postinfection, number of
infected cells detected facs represented first round infection and
therefore could used readout number infectious particles the
inoculum. titers different laboratory clinical strains denv
were compared using facs, plaque, endpoint dilution assays, strains 
the facs titers comparable titers obtained plaque endpoint dilution
assays. facs assay improvement plaque assay the
infection period reduced 5 7 days 24 h assay used to
titrate clinical isolates frequently form clear plaques cell
monolayers. novel facs-based methods described facilitate
laboratory studies dengue.
