plasmids cloning expression full-length double-stranded cdnas
under control sv40 early late gene promoter.

breathnach r, harris ba.

okayama berg (1) recently described technique high efficiency 
cloning full-length dscdnas. constructed eukaryotic expression vectors
compatible technique (and classical techniques) dscdna
cloning. vectors recombinants obtained contain dscdnas the
correct orientation downstream block sequence comprising either the
sv40 early late gene promoter linked pair splice sites rabbit
beta-globin gene. sequence encoding sv40 polyadenylation site follows the
dscdna. used vectors make library chicken oviduct polya(+) 
rna using okayama berg technique. ovalbumin recombinants occur the
library expected frequency high proportion contain full length
copies ovalbumin mrna. however, similar result obtained for
conalbumin recombinants. recombinants introduced eukaryotic cells
by either calcium phosphate coprecipitation protoplast fusion, expression of
chicken ovalbumin conalbumin may detected indirect immunofluorescence.
under optimal conditions (use sv40 late promoter cos 7 cells) ovalbumin
protein could detected ovalbumin recombinant present 2%
of protoplasts used fusion. suggests colony banks obtained
using vectors could screened batches 50 protoplast fusion
followed search expression given protein using indirect
immunofluorescence.
