purpose review: review broad spectrum nonreplicating viral vectors
which studied extensively, preclinical studies clinical
efficacy trials, include promising hiv vaccine candidates.
recent findings: success rv144 trial, canarypox virus-based
regimen, contrasts failures adenovirus-5 (ad5)-based regimens 
the step study, phambili study [hiv vaccine trials network (hvtn) 503], and
the hvtn 505 study recently modified halt vaccinations of
clinical futility.
summary: safety profile, immunogenicity, variety available candidates 
make nonreplicating viral vectors attractive hiv vaccine development.
building success rv144 study, studies of
orthopoxvirus-based vaccines, including vaccinia-based vaccines, ongoing 
planned future. despite failures ad5-based vaccines in
clinical efficacy trials, adenovirus serotypes remain promising candidates,
especially prime-boost combination products, potential
use mosaic inserts. nonreplicating viral vectors the
rhabdoviruses, alphaviruses, nonhuman adenoviruses, provide additional
avenues exploration.
