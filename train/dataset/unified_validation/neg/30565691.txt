clusterin (clu) chaperone-like protein multiple functions. sclu is
frequently upregulated prostate tumor cells chemo- radiotherapy and
after surgical pharmacological castration. moreover, clu documented
to modulate cellular homolog murine thymoma virus akt8 oncogene (akt)
activity. here, investigated clu overexpression influences
phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (pi3k)/akt signaling human normal cancer
epithelial prostate cells. human prostate cells stably transfected clu 
broadly profiled reverse phase protein array (rppa), particular emphasis 
on pi3k/akt pathway. effect clu overexpression normal cancer
cell motility also tested. results clearly indicate clu
overexpression enhances phosphorylation akt restricted isoform 2.
mechanistically, explained finding phosphatase ph
domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatase 1 (phlpp1), known to
dephosphorylate akt2 s474, markedly downregulated clu, whereas mir-190, 
a negative regulator phlpp1, upregulated. moreover, found that
phosphatase tensin homolog (pten) heavily phosphorylated the
inhibitory site s380, contributing hyperactivation akt signaling. by
keeping akt2 phosphorylation high, clu dramatically enhances migratory
behavior prostate epithelial cell lines different migratory invasive 
phenotypes, namely prostate normal epithelial 1a (pnt1a) prostatic carcinoma 
3 (pc3) cells. altogether, results unravel first time circuit by
which clu switch low migration phenotype toward high migration phenotype,
through mir-190-dependent downmodulation phlpp1 expression and, turn,
stabilization akt2 phosphorylation.
