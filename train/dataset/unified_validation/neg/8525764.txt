hepatitis b virus infection responsible important number world
morbimortality. associated severe liver outcome cirrhosis 
hepatocellular carcinoma. diverse factors influence severity liver injury 
produced hepatitis b virus (hbv): emergence hbv mutants unable to
secrete "e" antigen (pre-core mutants), virus host genetic heterogenicity
and immune system competence. particularly, presence pre-core mutants in
chronic carriers associated low response interferon therapy. present
paper present evidence presence mutants chronically
infected, hbeag negative patients (hbsag positive) argentina. viral dnas 
extracted sera nine patients, amplified pcr characterized by
restriction enzyme assay. appear pre-core mutants according
with serological markers low level viral dna detected serum.
further genetic characterization one nucleotide sequence analysis
of pre-core region let allowed us show modifications codon 15 28
both previously described pre-core mutants.
