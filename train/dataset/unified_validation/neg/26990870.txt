during epstein-barr virus (ebv) latency, ebv genome largely silenced by
methylation. silencing overturned switch lytic cycle. a
key event production viral protein zta binds three
zta-response elements (zre) rta promoter (rp), two (zre2 and
zre3) include three cpg motifs methylated latent genome. bisulphite
pyrosequencing reaction used quantify methylation zre2, zre3a, 
zre3b ebv-positive cell lines ex vivo samples ebv-related diseases, 
in order assess whether level methylation zres could provide
additional information viral dna load serology characterization 
ebv-associated diseases. pbmc two patients infectious mononucleosis,
over time rp became increasingly methylated whereas ebv load decreased. tonsil
from patients chronic tonsillitis, methylation less in
ebv-associated tumors, regardless viral load. even striking 
when zre3a zre3b considered since samples presented
unbalanced profiles zre2. ebv reactivation cell culture showed the
reduction overall level methylation closely related the
production unmethylated virions. thus, assessment level of
methylation may help better characterize ebv replication pbmc in
biopsies high ebv load, infectious mononucleosis ebv-associated
cancers. j. med. virol. 88:1814-1820, 2016. © 2016 wiley periodicals, inc.
