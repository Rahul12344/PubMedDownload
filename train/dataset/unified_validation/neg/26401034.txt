antibodies play critical role immunity enterovirus 71 (ev71).
however, ev71-specific antibodies neutralize infections remains poorly
understood. report working mechanism group three monoclonal 
antibodies (mabs) potently neutralize ev71. found three mabs
(termed d5, h7, c4, respectively) recognize conserved neutralizing
epitope within vp1 gh loop ev71. single mabs group, exemplified by
d5, could inhibit ev71 infection cell cultures pre- and
postattachment stages cell type-independent manner. specifically, mab
treatment resulted blockade multiple steps ev71 entry, including
virus attachment, internalization, subsequent uncoating rna release.
furthermore, show d5 c4 antibodies interfere ev71
binding key receptors, including heparan sulfate, scarb2, psgl-1, thus
providing possible explanation observed multi-inhibitory function of
the mabs. collectively, study unravels mechanism neutralization a
unique group anti-ev71 mabs targeting conserved vp1 gh loop. findings 
should enhance understanding mab-mediated immunity enterovirus
infections accelerate development mab-based anti-ev71 therapeutic
drugs.importance: enterovirus 71 (ev71) major causative agent hand, foot,
and mouth disease (hfmd), caused significant morbidities and
mortalities young children. neither vaccine antiviral drug is
available. neutralizing antibodies major protective components ev71
immunity. here, unraveled unusual mechanism ev71 neutralization a
group three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mabs). mabs bound
the conserved epitope located vp1 gh loop ev71. interestingly,
mechanistic studies showed single antibodies mab group could block
ev71 attachment internalization viral entry process interfere 
with ev71 binding heparan sulfate, scarb2, psgl-1 molecules, key
receptors involved different steps ev71 entry. findings greatly enhance
the understanding interplays among ev71, neutralizing antibodies, host
receptors, turn facilitate development mab-based
anti-ev71 therapy.
