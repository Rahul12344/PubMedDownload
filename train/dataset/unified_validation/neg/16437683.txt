aim: elucidate role peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
alpha (pparalpha) target gene carnitine palmitoyl acyl-coa transferase 1a
(cpt1a) pathogenesis hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection.
methods: liver samples collected patients chronic hcv
infection controls. hepg2 cells transfected vector pef352neo
carrying. two independent clones (clone n3 n4) stably expressing hcv core
protein analyzed. total rna extracted cells liver tissues.
pparalpha cpt1a mrnas quantified real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(pcr) using sybr green master. total extracted proteins separated by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted. membranes incubated 
with anti-pparalpha antibody, swine anti-rabbit igg conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase pparalpha. protein bands revealed enhanced 
chemiluminescence reaction pparalpha. immunohistochemical staining of
pparalpha, sections incubated primary goat polyclonal antibody
directed pparalpha room temperature.
results: real-time pcr indicated pparalpha level expression level of
cpt1a gene hepatitis c patients lowered significantly compared the
controls (1.8+/-2.8 vs 13+/-3.4, p = 0.0002; 1.1+/-1.5 vs 7.4+/-1, p = 0.004).
western blot results showed level pparalpha protein livers 
hepatitis c patients lower controls (2.3+/-0.3 vs 3.6+/-0.2, p =
0.009). immunohistochemical staining results chronic hepatitis c patients 
indicated decrease pparalpha staining hepatocytes compared 
the control livers. vitro studies found n3 n4 colon stably
expressing hcv core protein, pparalpha mrna levels significantly lower
than controls.
conclusion: impaired intrahepatic pparalpha expression associated the
pathogenic mechanism hepatic injury chronic hcv infection. hcv
infection reduced expression pparalpha cpt1a level 
mrnas also proteins. pparalpha plays important role pathogenesis of
chronic hcv infection, impaired function nuclear receptor hcv 
infection needs studies.
