self-cleaving ribozymes discovered 30 years ago found
throughout nature, bacteria animals, little known their
biological functions regulation, particularly cofactors metabolites
alter activity. hepatitis delta virus-like self-cleaving ribozyme maps
upstream phosphoglucosamine mutase (glmm) open reading frame genome
of human gut bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii. presence a
ribozyme untranslated region glmm suggests regulation mechanism of
gene expression. bacterial hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, enzyme
glmm catalyzes isomerization glucosamine 6-phosphate glucosamine
1-phosphate. study, investigated effect metabolites on
the co-transcriptional self-cleavage rate ribozyme. results suggest
that glucosamine 6-phosphate, glucosamine 1-phosphate, allosteric
ligand increases self-cleavage rate drz-fpra-1, providing first
known example allosteric modulation self-cleaving ribozyme the
substrate adjacent gene product. given ribozyme activated by
the glmm substrate, product, allosteric modulation may represent
a potential feed-forward mechanism gene expression regulation bacteria.
