respiratory syncytial virus continues pose serious threat pediatric
populations worldwide. genomic makeup 15,200 nucleotides, virus
encodes 11 proteins serving envelope spikes, inner envelope proteins, 
non-structural ribonucleocapsid complexes. fusion (f) attachment (g) 
surface glycoproteins key targets neutralizing antibodies. highly
variable g altered glycosylations conformational alternations f
create challenges vaccine development. metastable f protein is
responsible rsv-host cell fusion thus infectivity. novel antigenic sites 
were identified form following stabilization solving crystal 
structure. importantly, site Ã¸ displays neutralizing activity exceeding 
post-f-specific shared antigenic sites, site ii target
for palivizumab therapeutic antibody. induction high neutralizing antibody
responses pre-f immunization animal models promoted major vaccine
candidate. since rsv infection serious age extremities in
individuals undermining health conditions, vaccines developed to
target populations. infants three months age suppressive
immune system, making vaccines' immunogenicity weak. therefore, suggested
strategy protect newborns rsv infection would passive immunity
of maternal antibodies. hence, pregnant women third trimester 
selected ideal target vaccination rsv pre-f vaccine. review
summarizes different modes rsv pathogenesis host's immune response 
the infection, illustrates latest updates vaccine development and
vaccination approaches.
