abscisic acid (aba) key hormone regulating plant growth, development the
response biotic abiotic stress. aba binding pyrabactin resistance
(pyr)/pyr1-like (pyl)/regulatory component abscisic acid receptor (rcar)
intracellular receptors promotes formation stable complexes certain
protein phosphatases type 2c (pp2cs), leading activation aba
signalling. pyr/pyl/rcar family contains 14 genes arabidopsis is
currently largest plant hormone receptor family known; however, unclear
what functional differentiation exists among receptors. here, identify two
distinct classes receptors, dimeric monomeric, different intrinsic
affinities aba whose differential properties determined the
oligomeric state apo forms. moreover, find residue pyr1, h60,
that variable family members plays key role determining
oligomeric state. silico modelling aba activation pathway reveals 
monomeric receptors competitive advantage binding aba pp2cs.
this work illustrates receptor oligomerization modulate hormonal
responses generally, sensitivity ligand-dependent signalling
system.
