background: treatment feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) infection been
hampered absence specific combination antiretroviral treatment (art).
integrase strand transfer inhibitors (instis) emerging promising new
drug class hiv-1 treatment, evaluated possibility inhibiting
fiv replication using instis.
methods: phylogenetic analysis lentiviral integrase (in) sequences carried
out using paup* software. theoretical three-dimensional structure the
fiv catalytic core domain (ccd) obtained homology modeling based a
crystal structure hiv-1 ccd. interaction transferred strand of
viral dna catalytic cavity fiv deduced crystal
structure structurally similar transposase complexed transposable dna. 
molecular docking simulations conducted using genetic algorithm (gold).
antiviral activity tested feline lymphoblastoid mbm cells acutely infected
with fiv petaluma strain. circular total proviral dna quantified by
real-time pcr.
results: calculated insti-binding sites found nearly identical 
fiv hiv-1 ccds. close similarity primate feline lentivirus in
ccds also supported phylogenetic analysis. line these
bioinformatic analyses, fiv replication efficiently inhibited acutely
infected cell cultures three investigational instis, designed hiv-1 and
belonging different classes. note, naphthyridine carboxamide insti,
l-870,810 displayed ec50 low nanomolar range. inhibition fiv
integration situ shown real-time pcr experiments revealed
accumulation circular forms fiv dna within cells treated l-870,810.
conclusion: report drug class (other nucleosidic reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors) capable inhibiting fiv replication vitro. present
study helped establish l-870,810, compound successfully tested human
clinical trials, one potent anti-fiv agents ever tested vitro. 
this finding may provide new avenues treating fiv infection contribute to
the development small animal model mimicking effects art humans.
