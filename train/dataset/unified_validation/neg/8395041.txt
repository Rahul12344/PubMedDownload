saliva functions protect oral cavity pathogenic invasion by
modulating ability microbes colonize oral surfaces limiting
their growth and/or viability. although role salivary secretions the
modulation oral bacteria flora received considerable attention, little
is known concerning role viral pathogenesis. accordingly, purpose of
this study assess effect salivary secretions herpes simplex
virus type 1 (hsv-1) replication. initially, hsv-1 plaque titer reduction
assays performed determine ability human submandibular/sublingual 
(hsmsl) parotid (hps) salivas inhibit early stages hsv-1 infection 
(adsorption penetration). results suggested hsmsl hps
possess cell-protective virus neutralization activities, hsmsl being
more active hps. additional experiments performed determine the
effect saliva yield virus progeny. again, hsmsl caused greater
reduction hsv-1 replication hps. similar effect could be
obtained using vaccinia, suggesting inhibitory activity human saliva
is selective. collectively, results suggest human salivary secretions 
can modulate replication hsv-1 vitro.
