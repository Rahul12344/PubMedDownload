the reprogramming cord blood (cb) cells induced pluripotent stem cells
(ipscs) potential applications regenerative medicine converting cb
banks ipsc banks allogeneic cell replacement therapy. therefore, further
investigation novel approaches efficient reprogramming necessary.
here, show lentiviral expression oct4 together sox2 (os)
driven strong spleen focus-forming virus (sffv) promoter single vector 
can convert 2% cb cd34(+) cells ipscs without additional reprogramming
factors. reprogramming efficiency found critically dependent upon
expression levels os. generate transgene-free ipscs, developed an
improved episomal vector woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element
(wpre) increases transgene expression 50%. vector, we
successfully generated transgene-free ipscs using os alone. conclusion,
high-level expression os alone sufficient efficient reprogramming cb
cd34(+) cells ipscs. report first describe generation 
transgene-free ipscs use oct4 sox2 alone. findings have
important implications clinical applications ipscs.
