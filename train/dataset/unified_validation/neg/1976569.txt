the genomes many rna viruses terminate tertiary structure similar 
l-conformation trnas structure recognized many trna-specific
enzymes aminoacyl-trna synthetase. virtually entire 3'-untranslated
region (utr) tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) rna involved extended
tertiary structure containing, addition trna-like structure, pseudoknot
domain lies immediately upstream. although functions structures
are well understood, essential virus. demonstrate the
addition 204-base tmv 3'-untranslated region foreign mrna constructs
can increase gene expression 100-fold compared nonadenylated mrna. the
3'-utr tmv equal greater polyadenylated tail enhancing
gene expression electroporated dicot monocot protoplasts. tmv 3'-utr
is functionally similar polyadenylated tail increases mrna
stability translation must positioned 3' terminus function
efficiently. similar effects expression observed chinese hamster ovary
cells, demonstrating sequence functions wide range eukaryotes.
when extended tertiary structure dissected, upstream pseudoknot
domain found largely responsible increasing expression. the
inclusion trna-like structure, however, important full regulation.
