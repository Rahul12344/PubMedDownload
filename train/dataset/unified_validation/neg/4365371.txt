lymphocytes activated antigens mitogens acquire capacity replicate
viruses, number activated lymphocytes estimated virus
plaque assay. concanavalin pokeweed mitogen produced 33-fold 17-fold
increases virus plaqueforming cells (v-pfc), respectively, background,
while lipopolysaccharide produced 2- 3-fold increase. (thymus-derived
lymphocyte)-depleted lymphocyte populations, derived anti-theta-treated or
nude (arthymic) mouse spleens, failed produce v-pfc culture with
concanavalin pokeweed mitogen. present studies thus demonstrate the
virus plaque assay measures activated t-lymphocytes.a dissociation the
v-pfc response cell proliferation previously observed in
antigen-stimulated cells cultured presence mitotic inhibitors. the
present studies, stimulation cba (h2(k)) lymphocytes dba/2 (h2(d))
cells produced high levels thymidine incorporation, lymphocyte target-cell
cytotoxicity, v-pfc, stimulation balb/c (h2(d)) lymphocytes dba/2 
(h2(d)) cells resulted even higher levels thymidine incorporation a
virtual absence cytotoxic lymphocytes v-pfc. results indicate that
proliferation sufficient condition permitting lymphocytes either 
exert cytotoxicity target cells replicate viruses, suggest that
there may correlation development v-pfc cytotoxic
lymphocytes. consistent view least two
functional subpopulations t-lymphocytes.
