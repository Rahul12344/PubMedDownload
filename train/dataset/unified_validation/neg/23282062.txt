after entry cell, early steps human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) replication cycle mediated two functionally distinct
nucleoprotein complexes, reverse transcription complex (rtc) and
preintegration complex (pic). two unique viral complexes responsible
for conversion single-stranded rna genome double-stranded dna,
transport dna nucleus, integration viral dna 
host cell chromosome. prior biochemical analyses suggest complexes are
large contain multiple undiscovered host cell factors. study,
functional hiv-1 rtcs pics partially purified velocity gradient
centrifugation fractionation, concentrated, trypsin digested, analyzed by
lc-ms/ms. total seven parallel infected control biological replicates
were completed. database searches performed proteome discoverer a
comparison hiv-1 samples parallel uninfected control samples used
to identify unique cellular factors. analysis produced total data set of
11055 proteins. several previously characterized hiv-1 factors identified,
including xrcc6, tfrc, hsp70. presence xrcc6 confirmed infected
fractions shown associated hiv-1 dna immunoprecipitation-pcr
experiments. overall, analysis identified 94 proteins unique infected 
fractions 121 proteins unique control fractions â‰¥ 2 protein
assignments. additional 54 52 classified enriched infected 
and control samples, respectively, based 3-fold difference total proteome
discoverer probability score. differential expression several candidate
proteins validated western blot analysis. study contributes
additional novel candidate proteins growing published bioinformatic data
sets proteins contribute hiv-1 replication.
