langerhans cells cd4+ antigen-presenting cells dendritic cell family
that initiate primary secondary immune responses emigration from
skin mucosa. properties, langerhans cells proposed
as potential targets human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection as
potential vectors transmission primary hiv infection cells 
mucosal exposure. support theory, previous investigative studies 
demonstrated langerhans cells targets hiv infection vivo and
in vitro hiv-pulsed langerhans cells, well blood dendritic cells, 
induce productive infection co-cultured cells vitro. addition,
langerhans cell dysfunction proposed contributing pathogenesis
of cutaneous manifestations observed hiv+ individuals. recent
study, detected langerhans cell dysfunction patients acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, earlier stages hiv disease. review
previous current investigative studies hiv skin, emphasis 
on langerhans cells, discuss possible future investigations field.
