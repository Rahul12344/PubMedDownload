this study reports simple, rapid, low-cost, robust, multiplexed barcoded
paper-based assay (bpa) compatible mobile devices. inkjet printer 
xyz dispensing platform used realize mass-manufacturing barcoded
paper-based analytical devices (bpads) high precision efficiency. we
designed new group barcodes developed application (app) the
reading new code. new barcodes possess 16 times higher coding
capacity standard codabar code experiment drug residue
detection. bpa system allows applications assays blood-transmitted 
infections, drug residues milk multiplex nucleic acids. whole
detection process readout results completed within 10
minutes. limit detection enrofloxacin (enr) (8 ng ml-1) satisfies 
requirements drug residue monitoring. high rapidity, simplicity,
efficiency selectivity make bpa system extremely suitable applied
in rapid on-site detection.
