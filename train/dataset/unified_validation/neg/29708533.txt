gene manipulation specifically heart significantly potentiate the
investigation cardiac disease pathomechanisms therapeutic potential.
in vivo cardiac-specific gene delivery commonly achieved either systemic or
local delivery. systemic injection via tail vein easy efficient in
manipulating cardiac gene expression using recombinant adeno-associated virus 
9 (aav9). however, method requires relatively high amount vector for
efficient transduction, may result nontarget organ gene transduction.
here, describe simple, efficient, time-saving method intramyocardial 
injection vivo cardiac-specific gene manipulation mice. under
anesthesia (without ventilation), pectoral major minor muscles were
bluntly dissected, mouse heart quickly exposed manual
externalization small incision fourth intercostal space.
subsequently, adenovirus encoding luciferase (luc) vitamin receptor (vdr), 
or short hairpin rna (shrna) targeting vdr, injected hamilton syringe 
into myocardium. subsequent vivo imaging demonstrated luciferase 
successfully overexpressed specifically heart. moreover, western blot
analysis confirmed successful overexpression silencing vdr mouse
heart. mastered, technique used gene manipulation, well
as injection cells materials nanogels mouse heart.
