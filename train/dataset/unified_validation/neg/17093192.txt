understanding mechanisms hepatitis c virus (hcv) pathogenesis and
persistence hampered lack small, convenient animal models. gb 
virus b (gbv-b) phylogenetically closest related virus hcv. causes
generally acute occasionally chronic hepatitis small primates used 
as surrogate model hcv. known, however, whether gbv-b evolved
strategies circumvent host innate defenses similar hcv, property
that may contribute hcv persistence vivo. show cultured tamarin 
hepatocytes gbv-b ns3/4a protease, related catalytically inactive 
mutant, effectively blocks innate intracellular antiviral responses signaled
through rna helicase, retinoic acid-inducible gene (rig-i), essential
sensor molecule initiates host defenses many rna viruses, including 
hcv. gbv-b ns3/4a protease specifically cleaves mitochondrial antiviral signaling
protein (mavs; also known ips-1/cardif/visa) dislodges from
mitochondria, thereby disrupting function rig-i adaptor blocking

its major protease disrupt rig-i signaling impede innate antiviral
defenses. data provide support use gbv-b infection in
small primates accurate surrogate model deciphering virus-host
interactions hepacivirus pathogenesis.
