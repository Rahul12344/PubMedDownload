programs control eradication bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) are
often considered prudent expense control program within specified
time frame effectively prevents loss due disease expense control
does exceed costs associated infection. geographic areas,
concerns animal welfare desires reduce antibiotic usage may motivate 
bvdv control even control programs associated lack financial
return investment. geographic areas, concerns financial return 
on investment may key motivating factor considering implementation of
bvdv control programs. past experiences indicate systematic,
well-coordinated control programs clear potential success, while
voluntary control programs cultures distributed decision-making often
result notable initial progress ultimately ends dissolution of
efforts. segmentation cattle industry cow-calf producers,
stocker/backgrounders, feedlot operators amplifies distribution of
decision-making regarding control programs may result control measures for
one industry segment associated significant costs limited
rewards. though host range bvdv extends well beyond cattle, multiple
eradication programs focus testing removal persistently
infected (pi) cattle proven effective various countries. some
individuals consider education producers sufficient stimulate
eradication bvdv, research surrounding adoption innovative health care 
procedures suggests process adopting bvdv control programs a
social element. collegial interactions discussions may crucial in
facilitating systematic implementation necessary optimize long-term
success control programs. compulsory control programs may considered
efficient effective regions; however, nation individual
identification cattle remains voluntary, likelihood effective
compulsion control bvdv within farm ranch appears unlikely.
while currently available diagnostic tests sufficient support bvdv
eradication via systematic, well-coordinated programs, development a
diagnostic procedure safely consistently detect gestation pi
fetus 5 months gestation would valuable research breakthrough. this
desired testing modality would allow diagnosis pi calves, dam
continues provide biocontainment infected fetus. development could
speed progress control programs achieving goal bvdv control 
eventual eradication.
