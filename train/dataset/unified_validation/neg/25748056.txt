sequencing bulk polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product identify drug
resistance mutations informs antiretroviral therapy selection limited
sensitivity minority variants. alternatively, deep sequencing capable of
detecting minority variants subject sequencing errors pcr
resampling due low input templates. screened resistance mutations among
184 hiv-1-infected, therapy-naive subjects using 454 sequencing platform to
sequence two amplicons spanning hiv-1 reverse transcriptase codons 34-245.
samples 19 subjects also analyzed using miseq sequencing platform
for comparison. errors pcr resampling addressed tagging hiv-1
rna template copy (i.e., cdna) unique sequence tag (primer id), allowing a
consensus sequence constructed original template resampled
sequences. control reactions, primer id reduced 454 miseq errors 71
to 2.6 24 1.2 errors/10,000 nucleotides, respectively. miseq also
allowed accurate sequencing codon 65, important drug resistance position
embedded homopolymeric run poorly resolved 454 platform.
excluding homopolymeric positions, 14% subjects evidence â‰¥1 resistance 
mutation among primer id consensus sequences, compared 2.7% bulk population
sequencing. calls restricted mutations appeared twice among
consensus sequence populations, 6% subjects detectable resistance
mutations. use primer id revealed 5-15% template utilization average,
limiting depth deep sequencing sampling revealing sampling variation
due low template utilization. primer id addresses important limitations of
deep sequencing produces less biased estimates low-level resistance
mutations viral population.
