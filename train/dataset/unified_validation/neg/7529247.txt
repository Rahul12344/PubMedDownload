the diagnostic performances three commercially available recombinant
immunoblot assays (ribas) anti-hepatitis c virus antibody evaluated on
50 ortho-hcv riba-2 (riba-2)-indeterminate serum samples. concordant
interpretations obtained three tests 60% samples, with
56% positive, 2% indeterminate, 2% negative results. considering test
performance regard number remaining indeterminate results, analyzing
sera riba-3, inno-lia hcv ab iii, deciscan hcv reduced number of
samples reacting indeterminately 40, 6, 8%, respectively. three serum 
samples classified indeterminate inno-lia hcv ab iii well three
of four serum samples interpreted indeterminate deciscan hcv 16 
20 samples classified indeterminate riba-3 hepatitis c virus rna
positive pcr. study clearly shows good performance three tests
as confirmatory assays compared riba-2. however, according to
the manufacturers' criteria positivity, inno-lia hcv ab iii deciscan
hcv appeared suitable riba-3 interpreting serum samples
found indeterminate riba-2.
