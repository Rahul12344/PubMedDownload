natural tropism liver major obstacle systemic delivery of
adenoviruses cancer gene therapy. adenovirus binding soluble coagulation
factors cellular heparan sulphate proteoglycans via fiber shaft kktk
domain suggested cause liver tropism. serotype 5 adenovirus constructs
with mutated kktk regions exhibit liver detargeting, also transduce
tumors less efficiently, possibly due altered fiber conformation. we
constructed ad5/3lucs*, 5/3 chimeric adenovirus mutated kktk region. the
fiber knob swap hypothesized facilitate tumor transduction. construct
was studied without additional coagulation factor ablation. ad5/3lucs*
exhibited significantly reduced transduction human hepatic cells vitro 
mouse livers vivo. combination coagulation factor ablation by
warfarinization ad5/3lucs* seemed enhance liver detargeting. cancer
cell transduction ad5/3lucs* retained vitro. vivo, viral particle
accumulation m4a4-lm3 xenograft tumors comparable controls, but
ad5/3lucs* transgene expression nearly abolished. coagulation factor ablation
did affect tumor transduction. studies set stage further
investigations effects kktk mutation coagulation factor
ablation context 5/3 serotype chimerism. note, putative
disconnect tumor transduction transgene expression could prove useful
in understanding adenovirus biology.
