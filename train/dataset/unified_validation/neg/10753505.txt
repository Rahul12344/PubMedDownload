sema3a (sema iii, semd, collapsin-1) induce neuronal growth cone collapse and
axon repulsion distinct neuronal populations. study sema3a function in
patterning afferent projections developing spinal cord, employed 
recombinant adenoviral vector technique embryonic rat spinal cord slices.
virus solution injected dorsal aspect organotypic spinal cord
cultures segmentally attached dorsal root ganglia (sc-drg). cultures
grown presence nerve growth factor (ngf), injected either the
control virus adcmvlacz vehicle only, afferent innervation patterns 
similar control. however, unilateral injection of
adcmvsema3a/adcmvlacz sc-drg slices revealed strong inhibitory effect on
ngf-dependent sensory afferent growth. ectopic sema3a dorsal spinal cord, 
the target area ngf-responsive drg fibers vivo, created exclusion zone
for fibers result failed reach innervate their
appropriate target zones. taken together, gain sema3a function dorsal
aspect sc-drg cultures revealed dominant inhibitory effect ngf-dependent,
nociceptive sensory drg afferents, observation line model proposed
by e. k. messersmith et al. (1995, neuron 14, 949-959), suggesting sema3a
