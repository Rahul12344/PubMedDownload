when abelson murine leukemia virus (mulv-a) inoculated pristane-primed
balb/c mice, either plasmacytomas (pct), lymphosarcomas, mixed form 
induced shorter latent period pct induction mice treated 
with pristane alone. 3 neoplasms designated abelson's tumors. the
morphology induced malignant cells presence known surface
antigens analyzed electron microscopy. cell surface antigens (csa)
examined pc1, x.1, gross (gcsa), moloney (mcsa); viral envelope antigens
(vea) xvea, x1-vea, sub-gsvea, mvea. mulv-a-pristane-induced pct cells
produced markedly fewer intracisternal type-a particles mineral
oil-induced pct cells. most, all, mineral oil-induced pct cells carried
pc1 antigen produced many extracellular type-c viruses carrying xvea and
x1-vea, whereas abelson's tumor cells lower incidence smaller
amount pc1 x.1 antigens xvea+ virus lacked x1-vea+ virus. in
addition, abelson's tumors type-c viruses carry mcsa and
mvea ro gcsa sub-gsvea. macrophages pc1+ abelson's tumors 
many macrophages pc1-abelson's tumors contained various amounts pc1 on
their cell surfaces. reasons, abelson's tumors clearly distinct
from pristane- mineral oil-induced balb/c pct m-mulv- ro
g-mulv-induced tumors.
