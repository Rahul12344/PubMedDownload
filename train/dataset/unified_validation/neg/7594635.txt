normal human keratinocytes reconstitute vitro cohesive sheets of
epithelium suitable grafting onto patients. despite widespread use of
autografts allografts, data yet available productive infection by
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1) human keratinocytes. address this
point, challenged keratinocytes second passage culture with
htlv-iiib virus cell-free cell-mediated inoculum. viral entry not
achieved cell-free inoculum, thus demonstrating cultured keratinocytes do
not provide membrane requirements viral binding and/or internalization.
by contrast, cell-mediated inoculum overcame specific receptor constraints,
leading viral integration productive infection. p24gag viral protein
was transiently released culture supernatant, although low level. the
viral progeny produced infected keratinocytes rescued amplified by
co-culture experiments performed hiv-1 high sensitive cem-ss human
t-cell line. viral integration, p24gag production, secondary transmission 
lymphoid cells confirmed keratinocytes infected fourth
passage culture. taken together, results demonstrate cultured
keratinocytes infected htlv-iiib virus, maintained in
semi-latent form several passages inoculum rescued full
replication proper target. vitro demonstration lympho-epithelial
hiv-1 spreadings warns use inappropriately screened biopsies for
the preparation skin grafts.
