for century, research sought ways boost immune system order 
to eradicate tumors viruses exist escaping immunosurveillance. for
the treatment cancer hepatitis immunotherapeutic strategies overall
had limited clinical success. urgent need exists therefore introduce more
effective therapeutic approaches. invariant (i)nkt cells constitute conserved t
lymphocyte lineage dominant immunoregulatory, antitumor antiviral
effector cell properties. inkt specifically recognize glycolipid
α-galactosylceramide context cd1d resulting activation.
activated inkt promote development long-lasting th1 biased
proinflammatory immune response demonstrated multiple tumor-metastasis 
viral infection models. here, provide brief overview preclinical
data α-galactosylceramide formed basis subsequent clinical trials
in patients advanced cancer chronic hepatitis b/c, elaborate 
own clinical experience α-galactosylceramide patient groups.
