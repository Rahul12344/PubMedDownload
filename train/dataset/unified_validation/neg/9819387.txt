as part cdna library screen clones induce transformation nih 3t3
fibroblasts, isolated cdna encoding murine homolog guanine
nucleotide exchange factor rasgrp. point mutation predicted prevent
interaction ras abolished ability murine rasgrp (mrasgrp) to
transform fibroblasts activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (map
kinases). map kinase activation via mrasgrp enhanced coexpression h-,
k-, n-ras partially suppressed coexpression dominant negative
forms h- k-ras. c terminus mrasgrp contains pair ef hands 
a c1 domain similar phorbol ester- and
diacylglycerol-binding c1 domains protein kinase cs. ef hands could be
deleted without affecting ability mrasgrp transform nih 3t3 cells. in
contrast, deletion c1 domain adjacent cluster basic amino acids
eliminated transforming activity mrasgrp. transformation map kinase
activation via mrasgrp restored deleted c1 domain replaced either
by membrane-localizing prenylation signal diacylglycerol- phorbol
ester-binding c1 domain protein kinase c. transforming activity mrasgrp
could regulated phorbol ester serum concentrations low, 
effect phorbol ester dependent c1 domain mrasgrp. c1 domain 
could also confer phorbol myristate acetate-regulated transforming activity 
prenylation-defective mutant k-ras. c1 domain mediated translocation
of mrasgrp cell membranes response either phorbol ester serum
stimulation. results suggest primary mechanism activation of
mrasgrp fibroblasts recruitment diacylglycerol-enriched
membranes. mrasgrp expressed lymphoid tissues brain, well 
some lymphoid cell lines. cells, rasgrp potential serve 
direct link receptors stimulate diacylglycerol-generating
phospholipase cs activation ras.
