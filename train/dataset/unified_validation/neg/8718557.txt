we devised simple procedure titration varicella-zoster virus (vzv) dna
in throat swabs varicella patients. dna extracted throat
swabs, together known copy numbers cloned vzv dna fragment, were
10-fold serially diluted used template pcr. pcr products, after
heat denaturation, serially diluted 1.5 nacl adsorbed to
microplate wells. then, biotin-labeled dna probes hybridized the
immobilized dna. hybridization signal produced streptavidin-conjugated
beta-galactosidase fluorogenic enzyme substrate. comparing titration
curves clinical specimen cloned fragment, which
detection limit 10 copies, estimated copy numbers vzv dna 
the specimen. technique, evaluated degree potential
contagiousness patient along course infection: found that
varicella patients possessed highest quantity vzv dna throat the
first day illness.
