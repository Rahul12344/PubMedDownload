during neurotropic virus infection, microglia act source chemokines,
thereby regulating recruitment peripheral leukocytes multicellular
immune response within cns. herein, present comprehensive study the
chemokine production microglia response double-stranded rna (dsrna), a
conserved molecular pattern virus infection. transcriptional analyses of
chemokine genes revealed dsrna strongly induces expression cxc
chemokine ligand 10 (cxcl10) cc chemokine ligand 5 (ccl5) microglia. we
also observed dsrna stimulation triggered activation signaling
pathways mediated nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) mitogen-activated
protein kinases (mapk), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 2 
(erk1/2), p38, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk). microglial cxcl10 response 
to dsrna induced via nf-kappab, p38, jnk pathways, whereas the
dsrna-induced ccl5 production dependent jnk, other
signal-transducing molecules tested. addition, acidic environment of
intracellular vesicles required activation cellular signaling in
response dsrna. taken together, results suggest recognition 
dsrna structure selectively induces cxcl10 ccl5 responses microglia
through vacuolar ph-dependent activation nf-kappab mapk signaling
pathways.
