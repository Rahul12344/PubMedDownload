kaposi's sarcoma (ks) rare tumor except human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection becomes common. investigators assume 
that role hiv-1 passive, i.e., via inducing immune deficiency, thereby 
enhancing cancer development, specifically, case human herpesvirus 
8 (kshv) enhancing hhv-8 replication. suggest role hiv-1 is
more active disease process least two events: 1) promoting an
increase inflammatory cytokines, sustained release influences
early stage ks inciting local microinflammatory responses, 2) tat
protein effects growth inflammatory cells. cultures activated 
endothelial spindle cells, whether hyperplastic neoplastic, negative for
hhv-8; transmission hhv-8 induce cell growth transformation;
monkeys immune suppressed simian immunodeficiency virus infection infected
also hhv-8 develop ks; polymerase chain reaction analysis blood
cells shows hhv-8 sequences monocytes b cells (about 20% normal donors 
in maryland); m. starzl showed early ks cells (mostly macrophage)
positive hhv-8, increasing present endothelial cells late 
disease; increase hhv-8 found association progressive
immune deficiency; recent studies gambia others showed hhv-8 
very common infection, though hhv-2 known relatively common, hiv-1
is unusual ks. collectively, findings lead conclude that
there little evidence hhv-8 transforming virus been
repeatedly suggested role ks likely indirect (like 
hiv-1), perhaps necessary hardly likely sufficient ks development.
