this review describes proposed mechanism(s) classical virus
cross-protection plants, followed suggested coat protein-mediated
resistance (cp-mediated resistance). although common features,
cross-protection thought complex response caused replication
and expression entire viral genome, whereas resistance conferred by
the expression virus coat protein gene limited. term genetically
engineered cross-protection frequently used many cases the
phenotype resistance mimics cross-protection. however, cp-mediated
resistance, although narrow term, accurately describes resistance that
results expression virus cp gene transgenic plants.
