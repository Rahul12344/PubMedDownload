cancer cells exhibit two opposing methylation abnormalities: genome-wide
hypomethylation gene promoter hypermethylation. downregulation e-cadherin 
(cdh1) plays key role development diffuse-type gastric cancer, and
dna methylation major cause gene's silencing. hereditary diffuse
gastric cancer caused germline mutation cdh1 gene, dna methylation
frequently serves second hit completely inactivating gene. sporadic
diffuse-type gastric cancer, methylation cdh1 prevalent mutation 
of gene. epstein-barr virus (ebv)-associated gastric carcinoma
(ebv-associated gc) characterized concurrent methylation multiple genes,
and diffuse-type gastric cancer frequently seen among ebv-associated gcs.
patients pangastritis enlarged-fold gastritis, caused by
helicobacter pylori infection, reportedly increased risk diffuse-type
gastric cancer. notably, gastric mucosa enlarged-fold gastritis patients
exhibits cdh1 hypermethylation genome-wide hypomethylation. data
suggest aberrant dna methylation essential promoter carcinogenesis 
in individuals high risk diffuse-type gastric cancer.
