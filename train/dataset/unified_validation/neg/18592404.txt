infectious mononucleosis (im) acute lymphoproliferative disorder that
typically occurs young patients usually caused epstein-barr virus.
we report here, two cases tonsillar lesion im resembling marginal zone
b-cell lymphoma mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt) type. patients
consisted 18-year-old japanese woman 36-year-old japanese man. both
patients presented tonsillar mass. histologically, one case, tonsil
showed diffuse proliferation medium-sized lymphocytes. medium-sized
lymphocytes round slightly indented nuclei small solitary nucleoli 
and abundant clear cytoplasm somewhat resembled monocytoid b-cells. the
remaining one case, lymphoid follicles hyperplastic germinal centers with
ill-defined borders surrounded sheet-like proliferation polymorphous
infiltration showing marginal zone distribution pattern. high-power field,
the interfollicular area diffusely infiltrated polymorphous infiltrate
of medium-sized lymphocytes angulated nuclei somewhat resembling
centrocyte-like cells, immunoblasts, plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells and
histiocytes without epithelioid cell feature. however, no
cd43+ b-cells either lesion. moreover, polytypic nature b-cells was
demonstrated immunohistochemistry polymerase chain reaction. although malt 
type lymphoma rarely affected young adults, notably, number cases 
reported tonsil. present two cases indicated acute im be
added differential diagnosis malt type lymphoma young adults.
