background: interindividual variability susceptibility remains poorly
characterized environmental chemicals tetrachloroethylene (perc).
development population-based experimental models provide potential approach 
to fill critical need human health risk assessment.
objectives: study, aimed better characterize contribution of
glutathione (gsh) conjugation kidney toxicity perc degree of
associated interindividual toxicokinetic (tk) toxicodynamic (td) variability 
by using collaborative cross (cc) mouse population.
methods: male mice 45 strains intragastrically dosed perc
([formula: see text]) vehicle (5% alkamuls el-620 saline), time-course 
samples collected 24 h. population variability tk of
s-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)gsh (tcvg), s-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (tcvc),
and n-acetyl-s-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (nactcvc) quantified in
serum, liver, kidney, analyzed using toxicokinetic model. effects of
perc kidney weight, fatty acid metabolism-associated genes [ acot1 (acyl-coa
thioesterase 1), fabp1 (fatty acid-binding protein 1), ehhadh (enoyl-coenzyme
a, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme dehydrogenase)], marker proximal
tubular injury [kim-1 (kidney injury molecule-1)/hepatitis virus cellular
receptor 1 ( havcr1)] evaluated. finally, quantitative data interstrain
variability formation gsh conjugation metabolites perc its
kidney effects used calculate adjustment factors interindividual
variability tk td.
results: mice treated perc significantly lower kidney weight, higher
kidney-to-body weight (bw) ratio, higher expression fatty acid
metabolism-associated genes ( acot1, fabp1, ehhadh) marker proximal 
tubular injury (kim-1/ havcr1). liver levels tcvg significantly
correlated kim-1/ havcr1 kidney, consistent kidney injury being
associated gsh conjugation. found default uncertainty factor for
human variability may marginally adequate protect 95%, more, the
population kidney toxicity mediated perc.
discussion: overall, study demonstrates utility cc mouse
population characterizing metabolism-toxicity interactions quantifying
interindividual variability. refinement characterization of
interindividual variability accomplished incorporating data 
in silico population models tk (such physiologically based
pharmacokinetic model), well toxicodynamic responses.
