honey bees, primary managed insect pollinator, suffer considerable losses due
to deformed wing virus (dwv), rna virus vectored mite varroa
destructor. mite vectoring resulted emergence virulent dwv
variants. basis changes dwv poorly understood. most
importantly, remains unclear whether replication dwv occurs mite. in
this study, exposed varroa mites dwv type via feeding artificially
infected honey bees. significant, 357-fold increase dwv load observed in
these mites 2 days. however, 8 additional days passage honey
bee pupae low viral loads, dwv load dropped 29-fold. decrease
significantly reduced mites' ability transmit dwv honey bees. notably, 
negative-strand dwv rna, could indicate viral replication, detected
only mites collected pupae high dwv levels passaged
mites. also found varroa mites contain honey bee mrnas, consistent with
the acquisition honey bee cells would additionally contain dwv
replication complexes negative-strand dwv rna. propose transmission 
of dwv type varroa mites occurs non-propagative manner.
