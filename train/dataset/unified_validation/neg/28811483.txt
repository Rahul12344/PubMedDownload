hendra virus (hev) emerging pathogen concern australia given its
ability spillover reservoir host, pteropid bats, horses and
further humans, severe clinical presentation typical these
latter incidental hosts. specific human pressures recent decades, as
expanding human populations, urbanization, forest fragmentation, may have
altered ecological niche pteropus species acting natural hev reservoirs
and may modulate spillover risk. study explored influence of
inter-decadal net human local migration 1970 2000 changes the
habitat suitability p. alecto p. conspicillatus 1980 2015 in
eastern australia. ecological niches modeled using boosted regression 
trees subsequently fitted, along additional landscape factors, hev
spillovers explore spatial dependency zoonosis. spatial model 
showed ecological niche two flying fox species, human
footprint, proximity woody savanna strongly associated hev 
spillover together explained spatial dependency exhibited this
zoonosis. findings reinforce potential anthropogenic pressures to
shape landscape epidemiology hev spillover.
