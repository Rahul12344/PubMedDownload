cell-to-cell spread tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) presumed occur through
plant intercellular connections, plasmodesmata. viral movement active
process mediated specific virus-encoded p30 protein. p30 least two
functions, cooperatively bind single-stranded nucleic acids increase
plasmodesmatal permeability. here, visualized p30 complexes with
single-stranded dna rna. complexes long, unfolded, thin
(1.5 2.0 nm diameter). unlike tmv virions (300 x 18 nm), complexes 
compatible size p30-induced increase plasmodesmatal permeability
(2.4 3.1 nm), making likely candidates structures involved the
cell-to-cell movement tmv. mutational analysis using single double
deletion mutants p30 revealed three regions potentially important the
protein function. amino acid residues 65 86 possibly required correct 
folding active protein, regions amino acid residues 112 to
185 185 268 potentially contain two independently active single-stranded
nucleic acid binding domains designated binding domains b, respectively.
