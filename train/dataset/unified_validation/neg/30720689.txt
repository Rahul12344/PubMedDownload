background: 11-year-old girl dedicator cytokinesis 8 (dock8)
deficiency proposed potentially curative hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (hsct), donor haploidentical mother. however,
end-stage liver disease caused chronic cryptosporidium infection required
liver transplantation hsct.
methods: consequently, staged approach sequential liver transplant
followed hsct planned mother donor liver and
hsct.
results: patient successfully underwent left-lobe orthotopic liver
transplant; however, developed biliary leak delaying hsct. notably, the
recipient demonstrated 3% donor lymphocyte chimerism peripheral blood
immediately hsct. haploidentical-related donor hsct performed 2 months
after liver transplantation complicated development of
acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus viremia, primary graft failure, and
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. patient died sinusoidal obstruction
syndrome-associated multiorgan failure candida sepsis day +40 following
hsct.
conclusions: discuss many considerations inherent planning hsct
preceded liver transplant patients primary immunodeficiencies,
including role prolonged immunosuppression risk infection
before immune reconstitution. also discuss implications potential
recipient sensitization donor stem cells precipitated exposure
