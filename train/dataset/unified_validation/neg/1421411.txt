a group 58 heterosexual female partners (fp) human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1)-seropositive hemophiliacs studied conventional diagnostic
methods enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) western blot
analysis examine whether acquired hiv-1 infection sexual
transmission. subset 29 fp asked answer detailed questionnaire
concerning health, use "safer sex" techniques, risk factors
for hiv-1 infection. also additional blood drawn cd4 cell analysis, 
viral cultures, nef, gag, env immunoblots, polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) analysis assess occurrence "silent" hiv-1 infection a
high-risk seronegative population. among 58 fp, three found be
hiv-1-seropositive first testing, new seroconversions occurring with
subsequent testing remaining 55. two seropositive fp additional
testing found positive viral cultures, well positive pcr
results. seronegative fp (n = 24) additional testing were
negative viral culture, negative immunoblots, hiv-1 nucleic
acid sequences detected pcr. thus, population, silent hiv-1 infection 
appears rare occurrence antibody testing seems correlate 
more sensitive techniques pcr viral cultures.
