escherichia coli wg5, strain recommended international organization
for standardization (iso) detect somatic coliphages, transformed f(+)
by introducing plasmid famp, rendered capable simultaneously
detecting somatic f-specific coliphages. indeed, strain, cb390,
proved effective detecting similar numbers phages sum somatic 
and f-specific bacteriophages detected host strains recommended both
the iso u.s. environmental protection agency standardized methods.
