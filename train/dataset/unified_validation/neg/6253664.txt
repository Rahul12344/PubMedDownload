heterogeneity 3' end minus-strand rna poliovirus replicative
form.

richards oc, ehrenfeld e.

the 3' terminus strand (minus strand) complementary poliovirion rna
(plus strand) examined see whether sequence extends the
5'-nucleotide terminus plus strand, whether minus-strand synthesis
terminates prematurely, perhaps due presence nonreplicated nucleotide
primer initiation plus-strand synthesis. 3' terminus labeled 
32p using [5'-32p]pcp rna ligase, complete rnase digests performed
with rnases a, t1, u2. 32p-oligonucleotides analyzed size by
polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. major oligonucleotide products
formed consistent minus strand containing 3' ends complementary and
flush 5' end plus strand. however, variable proportion the
isolated minus strands different preparations heterogeneous length
and appeared differ presence one, two, three
3'-terminal residues.
