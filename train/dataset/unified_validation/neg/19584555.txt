peptide vaccine found effective powerful approach variety
of pathogens. explore multi-epitope based peptide vaccines infectious 
bronchitis virus (ibv), immunogenic peptides fused 3' terminal of
glutathione transferase gene (gst) expressed escherichia coli. elisa and
western blot analysis showed purified fusion proteins excellent
immune activity chicken anti-ibv serum. vaccination course, the
candidate peptide vaccines induced strong humoral cellular response, and
provided 80.0% immune protection, non-immunized chickens the
negative control group manifested obvious typical symptoms died virus
challenge. finding provides new way develop multi-epitope based peptide 
vaccine ibv.
