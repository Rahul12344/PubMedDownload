here report effect heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (hap) antiviral
compound, bay 41-4109, hepatitis b virus (hbv) capsid assembly on
preformed hbv capsids. hbv capsid icosahedral complex 120 capsid
protein dimers. bay41-4109 inhibits virus production vivo mechanism 
targets viral capsid. found bay 41-4109 able accelerate
and misdirect capsid assembly vitro. little one hap molecule every
five hbv dimers sufficient induce formation non-capsid polymers. unlike
the related molecule hap-1 (stray et al., proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 102:8138-43,
2005), stable assembly intermediates observed assembly reactions 
bay 41-4109, indicating accelerated assembly bay 41-4109 still
kinetically regulated nucleation rate. preformed capsids stabilized
by bay 41-4109, ratio one inhibitor molecule per two dimers. however, 
at bay 41-4109:dimer ratios 1:1 greater, capsids destabilized to
yield large non-capsid polymers. data suggest existence two
functionally distinguishable classes drug-binding sites hbv capsids.
occupation first class site stabilizes capsid, binding the
second class requires induces structural changes cannot tolerated
without destabilizing capsid. data suggest hap compounds may inhibit
virus replication inducing assembly inappropriately and, excess, by
misdirecting assembly decreasing stability normal capsids.
