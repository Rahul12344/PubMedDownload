the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1), formerly called cdc2 (or p34(cdc2)),
interacts cyclin b1 form active heterodimer. activity cdk1 is
subjected complex spatiotemporary regulation, required guarantee its
scheduled contribution mitotic prophase metaphase. moreover, the
activation cdk1 may required apoptosis induction particular
pathways cell killing. applies several clinically important settings, 
for instance paclitaxel-induced killing breast cancer cells, the
erbb2 receptor kinase mediate apoptosis inhibition inactivation of
cdk1. activation cdk1 participates also hiv-1-induced apoptosis,
upstream p53-dependent mitochondrial permeabilization step. unscheduled
cdk1 activation may contribute neuronal apoptosis occurring in
neurodegenerative diseases. finally, premature activation cdk1 lead to
mitotic catastrophe, instance irradiation-induced dna damage. thus, a
cell type-specific modulation cdk1 might taken advantage the
therapeutic correction pathogenic imbalances apoptosis control.
