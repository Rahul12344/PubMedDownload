an optimally effective aids vaccine would likely require induction both
neutralizing antibody cell-mediated immune responses, proven
difficult obtain previous clinical trials. report induction 
of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1)-specific immune responses in
healthy adult volunteers received multi-gene, polyvalent, dna
prime-protein boost hiv-1 vaccine formulation, dp6-001, phase clinical
trial. robust cross-subtype hiv-1 specific cell responses detected in
ifn-gamma elispot assays. furthermore, detected high titer serum antibody
responses recognized wide range primary hiv-1 env antigens also
neutralized pseudotyped viruses express primary env antigens from
multiple hiv-1 subtypes. findings demonstrate dna prime-protein
boost approach effective immunization method elicit humoral and
cell-mediated immune responses humans, polyvalent env formulation
could generate broad immune responses hiv-1 viruses diverse genetic
