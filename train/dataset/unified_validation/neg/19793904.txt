bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv; genus pestivirus) exist two biotypes,
cytopathogenic (cp) non-cytopathogenic (ncp). cp form differs ncp by
the continual expression free non-structural protein 3 (ns3). cp bvdv
infection cultured cells induces apoptosis, whereas ncp bvdv infection has
been reported block induction beta interferon (ifn-beta). to
investigate viral mechanisms underlying effects, ns3 ns2-3 proteins 
of ncp cp bvdv biotypes, together cognate ns3 co-factor ns4a, were
expressed cells, effect apoptosis induction ifn-beta was
investigated. expression ns3/4a resulted increased activity caspase-9
and caspase-3, indicating induction intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
mutational analysis revealed protease-inactive ns3/4a unable induce
apoptosis, suggesting ns3 protease activity required initiation of
apoptosis cp bvdv infection. ability ns2-3 modulate activation
of ifn-beta promoter also investigated. studies confirmed that,
unlike related hepatitis c virus gb virus-b, bvdv proteases unable to
inhibit tlr3- rig-i-dependent activation ifn-beta promoter. data
suggest bvdv ns3/4a responsible regulating levels cellular
apoptosis provide new insights regarding viral elements associated with
cp biotype pathogenesis.
