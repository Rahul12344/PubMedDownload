the immune system evolved various effector cells functions combat
diverse infectious agents equipped different virulence strategies. cd8 t
cells play critical role protective immunity listeria monocytogenes (lm),
a bacterium grows within host cell cytosol spreads directly into
neighboring cells. importance cd8 cells lm infection currently
attributed cytosolic niche organism, allows evade many
aspects immune surveillance. ctl lysis infected cells believed 
essential protective mechanism, presumably functioning release intracellular
bacteria, although precise role remains fully defined. study,
we examined contribution perforin-mediated ctl cytolysis protective
immunity recombinant lm capable defective cell-cell spread. we
found ctl cytolysis critical protective immunity lm capable of
cell-cell spread protective immunity spread-defective lm largely
independent ctl cytolysis. results demonstrate important
function ctl cytolysis counter microbial virulence strategy of
direct cell-cell spread. propose model advances current view the
role ctl cytolysis immunity intracellular pathogens.
