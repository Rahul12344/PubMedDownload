under conditions reversion amber mutant bacteriophage lambda
by gamma-rays enhanced subjecting irradiated phage sos repair,
gamma-ray-induced reversion two t7 ambers influenced this
error-prone bacterial repair system. survival t7 gamma-irradiated under
anoxic conditions somewhat enhanced sos repair, whereas survival of
phage irradiated oxygen affected.
