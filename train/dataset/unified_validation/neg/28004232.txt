beet curly top iran virus (bctiv) distinct geminivirus been
reported sugar-beet-growing farms iran. study, role the
splicing expression complementary-sense genes bctiv studied. total
rna extracted bctiv-infected tissue, predicted intron position
of complementary-sense mrna transcripts amplified rt-pcr followed by
cloning amplicons. sequence confirmed spliced unspliced
mrnas synthesized transcription unit. sequence comparison showed 
that 155-nt segment (intron) corresponding nucleotides 1890-2044 the
viral genome removed latter transcript therefore fusion 
the c1:c2 genes resulted creation continuous reading frame potential
production intact replication initiator protein (rep). bctiv intron comprises 
of consensus splicing signals required splicing eukaryotes and
several plant viruses including mastre- capulaviruses.
