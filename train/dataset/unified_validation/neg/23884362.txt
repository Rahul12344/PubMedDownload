recent studies suggest low levels reactive oxygen species (ros) often
modulate normal intracellular signalling pathways, determine cell fates and
control cell proliferation. found infection astrocytes the
neuropathogenic retrovirus ts1, mutant moloney murine leukemia retrovirus,
upregulated ros low levels early phase infection. this
upregulation intracellular ros downregulation nadph levels 
early phase ts1 infection separate event upregulation ros
during late phase ts1-mediated cell death occurred. treatment of
apocynin, potential inhibitor nadph oxidase (nox), inhibited establishment
of ts1 virus host cell. results suggested ros generated 
a consequence activation nox may play important role early
events virus life cycle leading establishment virus the
host cell. vitro results supported vivo experiment
which showed treatment apocynin decreased viral titre the
ts1-infected mouse brain increased lifespan infected mice. study 
provides first vitro vivo evidence mechanism ros are
involved ts1 retrovirus infection ts1-mediated neurodegenerative disease. 
our findings focusing early phase ts1 retrovirus life cycle could
provide better understanding retroviral life cycle, may offer specific
therapeutic targets suppressing viral replication alleviating
neurodegenerative symptoms mouse model.
