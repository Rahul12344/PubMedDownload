functional analysis nucleotide sequence surrounding cap site for
adenovirus type 5 region e1a messenger rnas.

hearing p, shenk t.

we constructed set small, dispersed deletion mutations sequences
surrounding cap site adenovirus type 5 region e1a transcription unit. 
the effects mutations e1a transcription studied vitro using a
hela cell-free extract, vivo reconstructing mutations back into
intact viral chromosomes analyzing e1a messenger rnas synthesized after
infection hela cells. sequence -35 +20 (relative cap
site +1) important efficient e1a transcription cap site selection 
in vitro. region includes "tata" homology, appeared essential 
transcription. sequences upstream -35 dispensable transcription in
vitro. different results found upon analysis set deletions in
vivo. none mutations affected steady-state levels cytoplasmic,
e1a-specific mrnas found infected hela cells twofold. deletions
of tata homology, however, generated e1a mrnas heterogeneous 5' ends,
and deletions downstream homology displaced 5' end mrnas about
the size deletion.
