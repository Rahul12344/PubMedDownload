the influenza m2 protein forms acid-activated proton channel essential
for virus replication. transmembrane h37 selects protons low
external ph w41 ensures proton conduction n terminus c
terminus prevents reverse current low internal ph. here, address the
molecular basis asymmetric conduction investigating structure and
dynamics mutant channel, w41f, permits reverse current low
internal ph. solid-state nmr experiments show w41f m2 retains the
ph-dependent α-helical conformations tetrameric structure wild-type
(wt) channel significantly altered protonation tautomeric equilibria 
at h37. high ph, h37 structure shifted toward π tautomer less
cationic tetrads, consistent faster forward deprotonation c terminus.
at low ph, mutant channel contains cationic tetrads wt channel,
consistent faster reverse protonation c terminus. 15n nmr spectra
allow extraction four h37 pkas show pkas clustered
in mutant channel compared wt m2. moreover, binding antiviral drug,
amantadine, n-terminal pore low ph convert histidines to
the neutral state, seen wt m2, left half histidines cationic,
unambiguously demonstrating c-terminal protonation h37 mutant. these
results indicate asymmetric conduction wt m2 due w41 inhibition 
c-terminal acid activation h37. trp replaced phe, protons be
transferred h37 bidirectionally distinct rate constants.
