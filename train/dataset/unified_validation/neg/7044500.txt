injection defect alkylated depurinated t7 bacteriophage: analysis dna
ejection.

mamet-bratley md, zollinger m, karska-wysocki b.

using dna ejection vitro model, studied dna injection defect 
caused alkylation depurination t7 bacteriophage. phage alkylated
with 0.02 methyl methanesulfonate 2 h 37 degrees c; alkylated phage 
then incubated 24 h 30 degrees c induce depurination. samples were
treated formamide cause dna ejection without dissociation phage
capsid. ejection, phage preparations analyzed electron
microscopy. dna lengths capsid-dna complexes measured; relative numbers
of full, empty, partially empty phage heads determined. establish the
direction dna ejection, e. coli rna polymerase bound capsid-dna
complexes. results showed dna partially ejected alkylated 
and depurinated phages. alkylated sample, rna polymerase bound 
dna end distal capsid; showed ejection started genetic 
left end. interpret results show, confirmation earlier results 
obtained marker rescue, alkylation causes t7 phage partially inject
its dna, starting genetic left end. depurinated phage, results
suggest partial dna injection responsible, case well, 
already documented injection defect.
