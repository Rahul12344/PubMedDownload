we found previously kuwaiti htlv-i isolates two nucleotide substitutions
in frequently sequenced regions htlv-i genome, namely: t-->c 4783 
the pol t-->c 6569 env genes. substitutions observed rarely in
other htlv-i isolates seemed good markers htlv-i lineage, the
"epicentre" located mashhad, iran. test hypothesis we
sequenced fragments htlv-i genome including sites 4783 6569 seven
isolates obtained iranians either living (five isolates) or
originating (two isolates) mashhad. rflp-based tests also designed 
used typing substitutions. seven isolates positive t-->c 
4783 six, env fragment amplifiable, also positive for
t-->c 6569. highly probable isolates mashhadi jews belong
to htlv-i lineage, although typed yet presence 
t-->c 6569 substitution. 2 "non-middle eastern" htlv-1, la réunion
island positive substitutions. another possible member of
mashhadi lineage htlv-i one isolate southern india two isolates
from american indians, british columbia, canada. determination the
t-->c 4783 t-->c 6569 markers htlv-i isolates different
geographical/ethnic origin may useful reconstruction routes 
htlv-i spread middle east and/or indian subcontinent regions of
the world and, possibly, gaining insights origin htlv-i asia.
