background: early childhood wheezing substantially impacts quality life in
high-income countries, data sparse early childhood wheezing in
low-income countries. estimate wheezing incidence, describe wheezing
phenotypes, explore contribution respiratory viral illnesses among
children aged <5 years urban bangladesh.
methods: 2004-2010, respiratory illness surveillance conducted through
weekly home visits. children fever respiratory illness referred 
examination study physicians including lung auscultation. 2005-2007,
every fifth referred child nasal washes tested human metapneumovirus,
respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza parainfluenza viruses.
results: april 2004-july 2010, 23,609 children enrolled in
surveillance. these, 11,912 (50%) male, median age enrollment 20
months (iqr 5-38), 4,711 (20%) ≥1 wheezing episode accounting 8,901
episodes (733 [8%] associated hospitalization); 25% wheezed <1 year of
age. among children aged <5 years, incidences wheezing wheezing
hospitalizations 2,335/10,000 192/10,000 child-years. twenty-eight
percent recurrent wheezing. recurrent versus non-recurrent wheezing episodes 
were likely associated oxygen saturation <93% (or 6.9, 95%ci
2.8-17.3), increased work breathing (or 1.6, 95%ci 1.4-1.8), and
hospitalization (or 2.0, 95%ci 1.6-2.4). respiratory viruses detected 66%
(578/873) episodes testing.
conclusion: urban bangladesh, early childhood wheezing common largely
associated respiratory virus infections. recurrent wheezing associated
with severe illness may predict children would benefit from
closer follow-up targeted interventions. pediatr pulmonol. 2016;51:588-595. ©
