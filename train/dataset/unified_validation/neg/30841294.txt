in july 1998, shortened internodes, reduced leaf size, leaf curling, bushy
plants observed tomato crops coastal region near casablanca,
morocco. symptoms similar described tomato yellow leaf curl
virus (tylcv) disease. september, disease present 130
ha outdoor protected crops. economic losses ranged 20 100%.
similar symptoms observed tomato crops northeastern region of
morocco. period, high populations bemisia tabaci (gennadius)
were observed tomato, sweet pepper, several weeds, including sonchus
oleraceus l., chenopodium sp., malva parviflora l., datura stramonium l.
attempts control whiteflies insecticides generally unsuccessful.
using pair degenerate primers (3) expected amplify region of
the component begomoviruses intergenic conserved nonanucleotide 
sequence first 5' quarter capsid protein gene, expected size
product 500 bp obtained six tomato leaf samples collected near
casablanca: four obtained symptomatic plants two apparently
symptomless plants. product size obtained sample of
tomato infected tylcv isolate reunion island, france (2), not
from sample symptomless tomato plants reunion. polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) product obtained one symptomatic sample morocco was
cloned sequenced (2). resulting sequence (embl no. aj133491) least
95.2% identical sequences tylcv isolates dominican republic (embl 
no. af024715), cuba (embl no. aj223505), israel (embl no. x15656; embl no. x76319
for mild clone), spain (embl no. af071228), reunion (embl no. aj010790). 
based sequence comparisons, tomato leaf sample infected a
geminivirus isolate belonging israeli species tylcv most
closely related dominican republic isolate (98.4% nucleotide identity). in
symptomless plants 500-bp pcr product obtained, infection may
have early stage. consistent fact 2-ha
field tomato samples collected, 4% plants exhibited
tylcv symptoms time collection, whereas least 70% plants showed
symptoms later, requiring farmer abandon crop. presence the
eastern mediterranean tylcv species western mediterranean country a
new observation; virus described spain portugal (1). in
morocco, tylcv symptoms observed 1996 1997 growing season,
following importation grafted tomato plants netherlands, farmer 
from casablanca region. references: (1) j. navas-castillo et al. plant dis.
