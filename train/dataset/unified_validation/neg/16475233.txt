the proteome proliferating human stem cell line analyzed then
utilized detect stem cell differentiation-associated changes protein
profile. analysis conducted stable human fetal midbrain stem cell 
line (rencell vm) displays properties neural stem cell. therefore, 
acquisition proteomic data representative cultured human neural
stem cells (hnscs) general. present 2-de protein-map cell
line annotations 402 spots representing 318 unique proteins identified by
ms. subsequent proteome profiling differentiating cells stem cell 
line days 0, 4 7 differentiation revealed changes expression 
49 identified spots could annotated 45 distinct proteins. this
differentiation-associated expression pattern validated western blot
analysis transgelin-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, well as
peroxiredoxin 1 4. group regulated proteins also included nudc,
ubiquilin-1, strap, stress-70 protein, creatine kinase b, glial fibrillary acidic
protein vimentin. results reflect large rearrangement proteome
during differentiation process stem cells terminally differentiated
neurons offer possibility characterization specific
targets driving stem cell differentiation.
