the epidemiology h5n1 h7n9 avian viruses humans infected china
differs despite viruses avian reassortants inherited six
internal genes common ancestor, h9n2. median age infected
populations substantially younger h5n1 virus (26 years) compared h7n9
virus (63 years). population susceptibility infection seasonal influenza 
is understood influenced cross-reactive cd8+ cells directed towards
immunogenic peptides derived internal viral proteins may provide 
level protection influenza infection. prior exposure to
seasonal influenza peptides may influence age-related infection patterns
observed h5n1 h7n9 viruses. comparison relatedness immunogenic
peptides historical human strains two avian emerged viruses was
undertaken possible explanation differences age incidence
observed. appeared relationship past exposure related
peptides lower number h5n1 virus cases older populations, however
the relationship prior exposure older populations among h7n9 virus
patients less clear.
