the role hamster papovavirus etiology transmissible lymphoma was
investigated strict conditions prevented natural exposure the
lymphoma agent. initial experiment, 19 hamsters exposed naturally
to transmissible lymphoma placed direct indirect contact with
weanling hamsters uninfected source. lymphoma developed original
infected hamsters well hamsters maintained direct indirect contact. 
in addition, one contact hamsters developed cutaneous epitheliomas,
containing hamster papovavirus. epithelioma homogenate inoculated into
primary hamster embryo cultures, hamster papovavirus replicated. second
