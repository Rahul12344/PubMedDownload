one quarter deaths worldwide year result infectious diseases
caused microbial pathogens. pathogens infect cause disease producing
virulence factors target host cell molecules. studying virulence factors
target host cells revealed fundamental principles cell biology. these
include important advances understanding cytoskeleton, organelles
and membrane-trafficking intermediates, signal transduction pathways, cell cycle 
regulators, organelle/protein recycling machinery, cell-death pathways.
such studies also revealed cellular pathways crucial immune
response. discoveries basic research cell biology pathogenesis are
actively translated development host-targeted therapies to
treat infectious diseases. thus many reasons cell biologists to
incorporate study microbial pathogens research programs.
