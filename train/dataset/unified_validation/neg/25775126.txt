lung macrophages important defence respiratory viral infection and
recent work demonstrated influenza-induced macrophage pdl1 expression in
the murine lung leads rapid modulation cd8+ cell responses via pd1
receptor. pd1/pdl1 pathway may downregulate acute inflammatory responses 
prevent tissue damage. aim study investigate mechanisms of
pdl1 regulation human macrophages response viral infection. ex-vivo
viral infection models using influenza rsv established human lung
explants, isolated lung macrophages monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm) and
analysed flow cytometry rt-pcr. incubation lung explants, lung
macrophages mdm x31 resulted mean cellular infection rates 18%,
18% 29% respectively. viral infection significantly increased cell surface
expression pdl1 explant macrophages, lung macrophages mdm not
explant epithelial cells. infected mdm induced ifnγ release autologous cd8+ 
t cells, effect enhanced pdl1 blockade. observed increases pdl1 mrna 
and ifnβ mrna protein release mdm response influenza infection.
knockdown ifnβ sirna, resulted 37.5% reduction ifnβ gene expression
in response infection, significant decrease pdl1 mrna. furthermore,
when mdm incubated ifnβ, cytokine caused increased expression of
pdl1 mrna. data indicate human macrophage pdl1 expression modulates
cd8+ cell ifnγ release response virus expression regulated
by autologous ifnβ production.
