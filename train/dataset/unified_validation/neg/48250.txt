rna-directed dna polymerase (reverse transcriptase) leukocytes individual
leukemic patients grouped velocity gradient analyses two distinct 
classes, low-molecular-weight (lmw) class approximately 70,000 a
high-molecular-weight (hmw) class 130,000 140,000. reverse
transcriptases mammalian type-c viruses one exception (see text)
been isolated enzymes molecular weights 70,000. study, the
reverse transcriptase extracellular gibbon ape leukemia virus also
isolated lmw class. however, enzyme gibbon virus-producing
cells isolated partially hmw form; form converted completely 
to lmw form treatment 0.5 kc1 0.5% triton x-100 could be
re-converted hmw form lowering kc1 triton x-100 concentrations.
a similar conversion hmw form lmw form demonstrated enzyme
from human leukemic cells. lmw form human gibbon ape cellular
enzymes utilized synthetic primer-templates similar fashion viral enzyme,
and form strongly inhibited antisera (igg) reverse transcriptase
from simian (woolly monkey) type-c virus. hmw form enzymes utilized
synthetic primer-templates less efficiently lmw form, resistant 
to inhibition antipolymerase igg simian type-c virus. hmw form the
cellular reverse transcriptases transcribed viral 70s rna absence of
synthetic primer relatively efficiently extracellular viral
form. data suggest hmw form due part aggregation the
lmw form part cellular factor(s) may affect form and
function intracellular reverse transciptase.
