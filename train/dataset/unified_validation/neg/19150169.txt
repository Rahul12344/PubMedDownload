adenoviral (ad) infection typically poses little health risk immunosufficient
individuals. however, immunocompromised individuals, aids patients
and organ transplant recipients, especially pediatric heart transplant
recipients, ad infection common lethal. ad dna packaging the
process whereby ad genome becomes encapsulated viral capsid. specific 
packaging dependent upon packaging sequence (ps), composed of
seven repeated elements called repeats. ad protein, iva2, required
for viral dna packaging, shown bind specifically synthetic dna
probes containing repeats ii, however, molecular details this
interaction investigated. work studied binding 
of truncated form iva2 protein, previously shown be
sufficient virus viability, dna probe containing repeats ii. 
find iva2 protein exists monomer solution, single
iva2 monomer binds dna high affinity (k(d)< approximately 10 nm),
and moderate specificity, triva2 protein interacts a
fundamentally different way dna containing repeats with
non-specific dna. also find elevated iva2 concentrations, additional
binding, beyond singly ligated complex, observed. reaction is
modeled representing binding second iva2 monomer singly
ligated complex, k(d) 1.4+/-0.7 microm, implying large degree of
negative cooperativity exists placing two iva2 monomers dna with
adjacent repeats.
