this study performed establish genetic variability aedes albopictus
within subang jaya, selangor, malaysia, using nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide dehydrogenase 5 subunit (nd5) mitochondrial dna (mtdna) marker. a
total 90 samples collected 9 localities within area subang
jaya municipality. genetic variability determined amplification
and sequencing fragment nd5 gene. eight distinct mtdna haplotypes
were identified. evolutionary relationship local haplotypes alongside 
28 reference strains used construct phylogram, analysis which
revealed low genetic differentiation terms nucleotide haplotype
diversity. bayesian method used infer phylogenetic tree, revealing a
unique relationship local isolates. study corroborates the
reliability nd5 identify distinct lineages polymorphism-based studies
and supplements existing body knowledge regarding genetic diversity.
this turn could potentially aid existing vector control strategies help
mitigate risk spread dengue virus.
