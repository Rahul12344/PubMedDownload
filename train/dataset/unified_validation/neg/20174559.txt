the innate immune response provides critical defense microbial
infections, including viruses. recognised pattern recognition
receptors including toll-like receptors (tlrs) rig-i like helicases (rlhs).
detection virus triggers signalling cascades induce transcription type
i interferons including ifnbeta, pivotal initiation an
anti-viral state. despite essential role ifnbeta anti-viral
response, incomplete understanding negative regulation of
ifnbeta induction. provide evidence expression nemo-related
protein, optineurin (nrp/fip2), role inhibition virus-triggered
ifnbeta induction. over-expression optineurin inhibited sendai-virus (sev) and
dsrna triggered induction ifnbeta, whereas depletion optineurin sirna 
promoted virus-induced ifnbeta production decreased rna virus replication.
immunoprecipitation immunofluorescence studies identified optineurin a
protein complex containing antiviral protein kinase tbk1 ubiquitin
ligase traf3. furthermore, mutagenesis studies determined binding of
ubiquitin essential correct sub-cellular localisation the
inhibitory function optineurin. work identifies optineurin critical 
regulator antiviral signalling potential target future antiviral
therapy.
