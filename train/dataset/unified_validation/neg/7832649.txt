a newly developed colorimetric method, dna enzyme immunoassay (deia), applied
to detection neuraminidase subtypes n1 n2 influenza viruses.
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction universal primers were
used genomic amplification h1n1, h2n2, h3n2 strains. following
amplification, aliquot pcr product hybridized biotinylated dna
sequences (n1/n2 probes) immobilized microtiter wells. hybridization event
was revealed monoclonal antibodies double stranded dna standard elisa 
reaction. assay described able distinguish accurately the
two neuraminidase subtypes human influenza viruses. simple rapid
method facilitating handling large number samples therefore seems
to easily applicable diagnostic laboratories.
