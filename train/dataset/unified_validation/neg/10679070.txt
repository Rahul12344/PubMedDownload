several hla-a*0201-restricted peptide epitopes used targets for
active immunotherapy identified within melanocyte differentiation
proteins. however, uncertainty exists effective way elicit cd8+
t cells epitopes vivo. report use transgenic mice
expressing derivative hla-a*0201, dendritic cells, enhance the
activation cd8+ cells recognize peptide epitopes derived human
tyrosinase glycoprotein 100. find altering cell surface
density immunizing peptide dendritic cells, either pulsing 
higher concentrations peptide, changing mhc-peptide-binding affinity
by generating variants parent peptides, size activated cd8+ t
cell populations modulated vivo. significantly, density peptide 
that produced largest response less maximum density achievable
through short-term peptide pulsing. also found, however, 
variant peptides effective eliciting primary recall cd8+ cell
responses recognize parental epitope, variant epitopes lead to
the outgrowth cd8+ cells recognize variant. hla-a*0201
transgenic mice provide important model define peptide variants are
most likely stimulate cd8+ cell populations recognize parental,
melanoma-specific peptide.
