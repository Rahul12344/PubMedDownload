different cytokines needed course culturing cells adoptive
immunotherapy. study aimed investigate differentiation directions
of lymphocytes related gene expression characteristics combined
stimulation lymphocytes different cytokines ebv antigen peptide combined
with cytokines. experiment divided 4 groups. levels total t
lymphocytes (cd3(+)), helper lymphocytes (cd3(+)cd4(+)), cytotoxic t-lymphocyte
(cd3(+)cd8(+)), memory cells (cd3(+)cd8(+)cd45ro(+)), naive cells
(cd3(+)cd8(+)cd45ra(+)), th2 cells (cd3(+)cd30(+)), b cells (cd19(+)), nk cells
(cd56(+)), naive regulatory cells (cd4(+)cd25(+)), precise regulatory cells
(cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+)) detected flow cytometry. expression levels of
house-keeping gene (mad1, pten), helper cells transcriptional regulatory gene
t-bet (th1), gata3 (th2), cytokine ifn-γ(th1), il-4(th2) detected using
rt-pcr. results showed ctl ebv polypeptide group dominant cells 
with certain clinical effects. comparison result ebv polypeptide group with
other 3 different cytokine stimulating groups demonstrated ebv antigen
peptide much effects stimulating ctl generation. expression of
ifn-γ gene significantly increased; helper differentiation-related gene
t-bet, gata3 also increased evidently, expression change house-keeping
gene mad1 pten evident. addition different cytokines antigen 
peptides culture may much effective stimulating ctl generation. 
is concluded specific ctl obtained using lymphocytes
co-cultured ebv cytokines, different cytokines play different
roles cell differentiation.
