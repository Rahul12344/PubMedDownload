we compared cns disease following intracerebral injection sjl mice with
daniel's (da) bean 8386 (bean) strains theiler's murine encephalomyelitis 
virus (tmev). tissue culture, da virulent bean. a
higher incidence demyelination spinal cords sjl/j mice infected with
da compared bean. however, extent demyelination similar 
virus strains comparing mice developed demyelination. even though
bean infection resulted lower incidence demyelination spinal cord,
these mice showed significant brain disease similar observed da.
there approximately 100 times virus specific rna cns da
infected mice compared bean infected mice. reflected virus
antigen positive cells (macrophages/microglia oligodendrocytes) spinal
cord white matter da infected mice compared bean. no
difference brain infiltrating immune cells da bean infected mice.
however, bean infected mice showed higher titers tmev specific antibody.
functional deficits measured rotarod severe da infected versus
bean infected mice. findings indicate diseases induced da or
bean distinct.
