most mhc class peptides presented immune system generated
during course protein breakdown proteasome. however, precise
role proteasome, e.g., whether particle protease
generates carboxyl (c) amino (n) termini presented 8- to
10-residue peptides, clear. here, show presentation db of
asnenmetm, peptide influenza nucleoprotein, kb fapgnypal, a
peptide sendai virus nucleoprotein, blocked proteasome inhibitor,
lactacystin. using plasmid minigene constructs encoding oligopeptides various 
lengths, found presentation asnenmetm c-terminally extended
peptides contain antigenic peptide plus three five additional amino 
acids presentation fapgnypal peptide containing fapgnypal plus one 
additional c-terminal residue required proteasome. contrast, the
proteasome inhibitor reduce presentation cytosolically expressed
asnenmetm fapgnypal n-terminally extended versions peptides,
suggesting involvement aminopeptidase(s) trimming n-extended
variants. accordingly, n termini 3n-extended peptides were
blocked acetylation, resistant hydrolysis cellular
aminopeptidases pure leucine aminopeptidase. moreover, introduced the
cytosol, ag presentation peptides occurred much lesser extent 
from nonacetylated counterparts. thus, proteasome essential 
generation asnenmetm fapgnypal peptides full-length
nucleoproteins. although generates c termini presented peptides, 
distinct aminopeptidase(s) trim n termini presented peptides 
their proper size.
