most adult humans infected epstein-barr virus (ebv) carry 
latent virus. ebv genome codes several proteins form early
antigen complex important viral replication; one proteins is
deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dutpase). ebv-encoded dutpase 
can induce sickness responses mice. stress increase latent virus
reactivation, hypothesized chronic restraint would exacerbate sickness
behaviors elicited ebv-encoded dutpase. male swiss-webster mice injected 
daily 15 days either saline ebv-encoded dutpase. additionally, half
of mice condition either restrained 3h daily left
undisturbed. restraint stress impaired learning memory passive
avoidance chamber; impaired learning memory due ebv-encoded dutpase
injected restrained mice. ebv-encoded dutpase induced sickness responses and
restraint stress interacts ebv-encoded dutpase exacerbate sickness
response. data support role ebv-encoded dutpase restraint stress 
in altering pathophysiology ebv independent viral replication.
