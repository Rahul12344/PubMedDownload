lscc hd3 chicken erythroleukemia cells, transformed temperature-sensitive
avian erythroblastosis virus (tsaev), secreted medium several
transforming factors separation bio-cel p-60 chromatography,
stimulated quiescent (g0) chicken embryo fibroblasts nih 3t3 mouse cells to
replicate dna serum-free medium form colonies soft agar. of
these factors also mitogenic lscc hd3 cells they
were rendered phenotypically untransformed incubation 42 degrees c to
inactivate ts aev. transformed lscc hd3 cells also secreted a
non-mitogenic 40 kda factor blocked erythropoietin-induced
differentiation untransformed lscc hd3 (at 42 degrees c) dmso-induced 
differentiation friend murine erythroleukemia cells into
hemoglobin-synthetizing erythroid cells.
