novel ways delivering plasmid dna elicit humoral iga, igg cell-mediated
immune responses mice investigated. intraoral administration dna in
the cheek, using jet immunization technique, elicited highest iga mucosal
responses. intranasal immunization gave strong mucosal iga responses and
persistent systemic igg. immunoglobulin isotype analysis revealed igg1 profile
for intramuscular tongue gene gun immunizations igg2a profile
following oral jet injection intranasal application. route delivery
was importance characteristics quality mucosal immune
response following dna immunization. dna vaccine delivery, intraoral jet 
injection technique advantages simple rapid way of
administering dna solution provoking specific mucosal iga when
administered mucosal associated lymphoid tissue.
