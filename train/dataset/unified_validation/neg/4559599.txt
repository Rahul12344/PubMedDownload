location promoter operator sites biotin gene cluster escherichia
coli.

biotin independence e. coli requires five closely linked genes, bioa, biob,
biof, bioc, biod. residual gene activity deletion mutants been
studied complementation enzyme assays. deletion left end the
bioa gene impair expression remaining genes, deletions from
the left extending biob abolish gene expression. nonsense mutations in
biob reduce expression bioc, biof, biod. therefore, four genes, biob, 
biof, bioc, biod, transcribed unit left right, a
promotor located bioa biob. expression bio genes is
repressible added biotin. deletions removing left end bioa not
affect repressibility biod. therefore operator, well promoter,
lie right bioa. one deletion removes bioa, biob, biof renders 
the biod gene constitutive, presumably fusion unknown operon. therefore,
the operator lies left bioc.
