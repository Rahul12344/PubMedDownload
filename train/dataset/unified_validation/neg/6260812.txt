four young strain iii/j rabbits sexes inoculated single dose 
of prototype partially purified herpesvirus saimiri (hvs) via iv im routes.
all inoculated animals enlarged lymph nodes, significant levels of
antibodies hvs early, late, membrane antigens detectable the
infection. animals died killed hvs isolated the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells various lymph nodes the
kidney. microscopic examination showed animals poorly
differentiated lymphomas. response mononuclear cells pha from
peripheral blood infected animals showed depressed cell mediated immune
responses. humoral cellular immunity responses tumorigenesis were
comparable reported nonhuman primates hvs-induced tumors. thus, 
the inbred strain iii/j appears inexpensive suitable model studies
of oncogenic herpesvirus-induced cancers.
