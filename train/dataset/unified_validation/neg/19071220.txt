by using suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh) cdna microarrays, we
studied differentially expressed genes haemocytes crayfish
(procambarus clarkii) infected white spot syndrome virus (wssv). thirty
three differentially expressed genes detected 31 up-regulated 
and 2 down-regulated. up-regulated genes include serine protease
inhibitors, chaperonin, synaptasome-associated protein 25 kd(snap25), tubulin,
zinc-finger protein, intracellular fatty acid binding protein, extracellular
superoxide dismutase precursor, arginine kinase, 70 kd heat shock like protein
and bax inhibitor-1. lot genes including 2 down-regulated genes are
still unknown. immuno-related genes responding virus infection
provide new insight study shrimp innate immunity.
