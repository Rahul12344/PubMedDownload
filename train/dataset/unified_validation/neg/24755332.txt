objective: situ reprogramming cardiac fibroblasts induced
cardiomyocytes administration gene transfer vectors encoding gata4 (g),
mef2c (m), tbx5 (t) shown improve ventricular function in
myocardial infarction models. efficacy strategy could, however, be
limited need fibroblast targets infected 3 times--once each
of 3 transgene vectors. hypothesized polycistronic "triplet" vector
encoding 3 transgenes would enhance postinfarct ventricular function compared
with use "singlet" vectors.
methods: validation polycistronic vector expression vitro, adult 
male fischer 344 rats (n=6) underwent coronary ligation without
intramyocardial administration adenovirus encoding 3 major vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf) isoforms (advegf-all6a positive), followed 3
weeks later administration advegf-all6a-positive treated rats of
singlet lentivirus encoding g, m, (1×10(5) transducing units each) the
same total dose gmt "triplet" lentivirus vector.
results: western blots demonstrated triplet singlet vectors yielded
equivalent gmt transgene expression, fluorescence activated cell sorting
demonstrated triplet vectors nearly twice potent singlet vectors 
in generating induced cardiomyocytes cardiac fibroblasts. echocardiography
demonstrated gmt triplet vectors effective 3 combined
singlet vectors enhancing ventricular function postinfarct baselines
(triplet, 37%±10%; singlet, 13%±7%; negative control, 9%±5%; p<.05).
conclusions: data confirmed situ administration g, m,
and induces postinfarct ventricular functional improvement gmt
polycistronic vectors enhance efficacy strategy.
