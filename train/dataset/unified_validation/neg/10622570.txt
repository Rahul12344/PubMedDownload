the risk hcv transmission blood blood products greatly reduced
since early 1980's. selection non-remunerated donors, donor selection to
prevent hiv transmission, initial surrogate testing regions, and
introduction anti-hcv testing contributed this. alt surrogate
testing become obsolete since introduction anti-hcv testing. the
residual risk hcv transmission due donations anti-hcv window period 
at present 1 100 000 transfusions cellular products, and
transmission hcv plasma products treated modern inactivation methods
such solvent-detergent treatment, reported. hemovigilance
programmes, presently installed, provide data the
safety blood transfusion. introduction hcv nucleic amplification technology
(nat) quality control manufacturing pools plasma products a
form blood donor screening minipools anticipated many european
countries coming year. given industrial developments, nat testing of
individual blood donations may become available within next 2 years. hcv nat 
testing annihilate residual risk, cost-effectiveness
will become relatively low comparison public health measures.
