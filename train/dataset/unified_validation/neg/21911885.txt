background aims: genetic variations interleukin 28b (il28b) gene 
been associated viral response peg-interferon-α/ribavirin (pr) therapy in
hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotype 1 infected patients north america, europe
and asia. importance il28b variants argentine patients remains
unknown.
material methods: il28b host genotypes (rs8099917 rs12979860) were
determined population argentine patients european ancestry. results 
were analyzed looking association sustained virologic response
(svr) pr therapy compared baseline hosts' biochemical,
histological virological predictors response.
results: studied 102 patients, 60% men, 40% rs8099917 tt
and 18% rs12979860 cc. mean baseline serum hcv rna 1.673.092 iu/ml mean f
score was: 2.10 ± 1.18 (21% cirrhotic). svr rate higher rs8099917 tt
genotypes (55%) compared gt/gg (25%) (p = 0.002) rs1512979860 cc
(64%) ct/tt (30%) (p = 0.004). univariate analysis showed that
rs8099917 tt (or 3.7; 95 %ci 1.5-8.7; p = 0.002), rs12979860 cc (or 4.6; 95%ci
1.5-13.7; p = 0.006), low viral load (or 4.6; 95% ci 1.7-12.6; p = 0.002) and
f0-2 (or 8.5; 95% ci 2.3-30.6; p = 0.001) significantly associated svr.
in multivariate analysis, rs12979860 cc, rs8099917 tt, viral load < 400.000
iu/ml f0-2 associated svr rates (p = 0.029, p = 0.012, p = 0.013
and p = 0.004, respectively).
conclusion: il28b host genotypes added baseline predictors of
response pr therapy latin american patients european ancestry.
