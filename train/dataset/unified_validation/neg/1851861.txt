human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) activate human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
promoter accelerate cytopathic effects hiv-infected human cells. this
study examines regions hiv promoter required hhv-6 transactivation
in heterogeneous population primary human lymphocytes without
antigenic stimulation. two different strains hhv-6, gs z29, transactivated
the hiv promoter. gs strain transactivated promoter stimulated
and resting cells, z29 strain increased hiv promoter activity in
stimulated cells. three dna clones containing hhv-6(gs) genomic fragments
transactivated hiv promoter cotransfected cells. 21.4-kb dna clone,
pzvb70, showed highest transactivating ability, two dna
fragments, pzvb10 (6.2 kb) pzvh14 (8.7 kb), showed lower activity. one of
these clones, pzvh14, activated hiv promoter construct containing mutation 
in nf kappa b site. however, mutated nf kappa b promoter not
transactivated hhv-6(gs) infection cotransfection pzvb70 
pzvb10. data indicate nf kappa b sites hiv promoter are
essential transactivation hhv-6(gs) infection. increasing hiv
promoter activity primary lymphocytes, hhv-6 may consequently increase hiv
replication, leading increase cytopathic effect coinfected human 
t cells.
