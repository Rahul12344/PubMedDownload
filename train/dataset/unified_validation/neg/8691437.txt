ethyl 2-alkyl-4-aryl-3-oxobutyrates synthesized corresponding
arylacetonitriles 2-bromo esters. condensation butyrates thiourea
followed treatment chloroacetic acid afforded the
5-alkyl-6-(arylmethyl)uracils. condensation uracils acetals using
trimethylsilyl triflate (tms triflate) catalyst gave acyclic
5-alkyl-6-(arylmethyl)uracil derivatives. 6-benzyl-5-ethyluracil also
condensed methyl
5-o-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)-2-deoxy-3-o-(phenoxythiocarbonyl+
++)-alpha,beta-d-erythro-pentofuranoside, followed barton reduction and
deprotection, give anomers 6-benzyl-5-ethyl-2',3'-dideoxyuridine.
alkylation uracils alkyl chloromethyl sulfides gave new thio
analogues hept. new n1-substituted uracils tested activity
against hiv-1, thio analogues found extremely potent.
