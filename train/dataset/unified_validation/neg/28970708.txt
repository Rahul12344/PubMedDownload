background: nosocomial acquisition spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) 
debated different microbial etiology prognosis. identification of
clinical, laboratory predictors mortality appropriate empirical
antimicrobial selection necessary prevent early mortality morbidity. we
aimed find clinical bacteriological profile nosocomial and
community acquired sbp variants, predictors mortality.
material methods: one hundred fifty patients 162 discrete episodes
of different types sbp analyzed. relevant clinical laboratory data
were analyzed. sbp diagnosed according standard criteria classified as
community acquired infection detected within 48 h admission as
nosocomial 48 h admission hospital.
results: eighty seven percent community acquired sbp (csbp), 13% had
nosocomial sbp (nsbp). patients nsbp older, episodes gi bleed
and higher previous episodes encephalopathy. patients died older, had
worse encephalopathy. nsbp higher one month mortality. age, serum sodium,
encephalopathy nsbp predicted mortality. culture positivity 22.22%.
escherichia coli commonest organism isolated. difference 
the bacteriological profile csbp nsbp. e. coli showed 48%
resistance third generation cephalosporins. overall sensitivity to
aminoglycosides 75%.
conclusions: overall mortality 59%. nsbp significantly high one month
mortality. age, serum sodium, encephalopathy nsbp predictors of
mortality. bacteriological profile similar csbp nsbp.
