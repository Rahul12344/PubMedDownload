the ability emergency foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) vaccine protect cattle
from heterologous direct-contact challenge effect virus excretion
from oropharynx examined. oil adjuvant o1 manisa fmd vaccine
protected 20 cattle clinical disease following 5 days direct-contact
exposure five infected cattle 21 days post vaccination. donor cattle
had infected tongue inoculation different fmd virus same
serotype (o ukg 2001). protection clinical disease prevent localised
sub-clinical infection oropharynx animals, although quantitative
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) showed level of
virus replication shortly direct-contact challenge greatly reduced in
vaccinated animals. nevertheless, 45% vaccinated cattle became
persistently infected 10(3)-10(6) rna copies per millilitre oropharyngeal
fluid 28 days post challenge. however, since live virus could readily
isolated, risk animals transmitting disease probably low.
the findings show even extremely severe challenge, use an
emergency vaccine prevent reduce local virus replication thereby
dramatically reduce amount virus released environment the
all-important early post-exposure period. data help model the
dynamics virus transmission future outbreaks disease vaccination
is considered.
