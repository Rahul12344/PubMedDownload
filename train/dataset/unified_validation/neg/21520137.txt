this study designed determine prevalence, forms transmission,
mutational profile viral load baseline hepatitis b virus (hbv) carriers
in delhi. hbv surface antigen (hbsag)-positive patients enrolled and
evaluated clinically liver function, serological markers hepatitis b 
hbv dna quantitation. tests carried 1 year later results
were compared. liver biopsy carried carriers active viral
replication. hbv dna-positive samples subjected polymerase chain reaction
single-stranded conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) screen mutations the
precore, core, x-gene prior sequencing analysis. among 100
patients examined, hbeag detected 23% 40% hbv dna-positive. of
the 40 hbv dna-positive cases, 8 precore/core mutations, [g1896a (10%),
t2066a (12.5%), t2050c (10%), g1888a (7.5%)]. x gene mutants were
detected. reduction viral load higher hbeag-positive patients, as
compared hbeag-negative patients, 1 year. follow-up, 2/8 hbv mutants
corresponded altered liver function morphological changes suggestive 
chronic hepatitis. one patient re-designated dna-negative follow-up and
had wild-type virus infection relatively low viral load. predominant
route hbv transmission determined parenteral. twenty percent the
hbv carriers infected precore core mutant hbv. although the
clinical biochemical profiles hbv carriers remained largely stable
on follow-up, evidence spontaneous reduction mean viral load 
over 1-year study period.
