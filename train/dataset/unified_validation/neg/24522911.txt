the extent hiv-1 clade b strains exhibit population-specific adaptations
to host hla alleles remains incompletely known, part due incomplete
characterization hla-associated hiv-1 polymorphisms (hla-aps) different
global populations. moreover, remains unknown extent hla
alleles may drive significantly different escape pathways across populations. 
the japanese population exhibits distinctive hla class allele distributions,
comparative analysis hla-aps hiv-1 clade b-infected japanese and
non-asian cohorts could shed light questions. however, hla-aps remain
incompletely mapped japan. cohort 430 treatment-naive japanese with
chronic hiv-1 clade b infection, identified 284 hla-aps gag, pol, nef
using phylogenetically corrected methods. number hla-associated
substitutions pol, notably restricted hla-b*52:01, weakly
inversely correlated plasma viral load (pvl), suggesting the
transmission persistence b*52:01-driven pol mutations could modulate the
pvl. differential selection hla-aps hla subtype members, including
those differing respect substitutions outside peptide-binding
groove, observed, meriting investigation mechanisms of
selection. notably, two-thirds hla-aps identified japan been
reported previous studies predominantly caucasian cohorts were
attributable hla alleles unique to, enriched in, japan. also identified 
71 cases hla allele drove significantly different escape pathways 
in japan versus predominantly caucasian cohorts. results underscore the
distinct global evolution hiv-1 clade b result host
population-specific cellular immune pressures.importance: cytotoxic lymphocyte 
(ctl) escape mutations hiv-1 broadly predictable based hla class 
alleles expressed host. hla allele distributions differ among
worldwide populations, pattern diversity hla-associated escape
mutations likely somewhat distinct race region.
hla-associated polymorphisms (hla-aps) hiv-1 previously identified
at population level european, north american, australian, african
cohorts; however, large-scale analyses hiv-1 clade b-specific hla-aps in
asians lacking. differential intraclade hiv-1 adaptation global
populations investigated via comparative analyses hla-associated
polymorphisms across ethnic groups, studies rare. here, identify 
hla-aps large japanese hiv-1 clade b cohort using phylogenetically informed 
methods observe majority previously
characterized predominantly caucasian populations. results highlight hiv's
unique adaptation cellular immune pressures imposed different global
populations.
