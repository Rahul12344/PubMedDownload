transgenic tobacco plants express genome-linked
protein/proteinase-coding region potyvirus tobacco vein mottling virus
(tvmv) produced tested reaction inoculation tvmv and
two potyviruses. plants develop disease symptoms 
inoculated large doses tvmv susceptible infection the
other potyviruses control plants. lines tobacco express coat 
protein- nonstructural cylindrical inclusion protein-coding regions were
also produced. coat protein transgenic plants protected all
three potyviruses, cylindrical inclusion transgenic plants were
susceptible three potyviruses. results indicate some, not
all, tvmv genes used confer protection potyviruses plants.
the results also suggest combinations viral genes transgenic plants
might improve protection potyviruses.
