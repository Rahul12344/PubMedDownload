herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (hsv-tk) phosphorylates prodrugs
ganciclovir (gcv) acyclovir (acv), leading disruption dna synthesis and
inhibition cell proliferation. hsv-tk vectors successfully employed 
in cardiovascular cancer gene therapy. activation gcv acv, an
initial phosphorylation step viral thymidine kinase, carried by
guanylate kinase. reasoned coexpression guanylate kinase (gk) with
hsv-tk would augment phosphorylation gcv acv, leading increased cell
killing. test hypothesis, vector expressing tk gk (tkcitegk) was
developed tested vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) vitro in
vivo. compared hsv-tk vectors, killing vascular cells transduced with
tkcitegk exposed gcv significantly increased (p = 0.03). tkcitegk 
construct evaluated three promoters: cmv, ef1alpha, sm22alpha.
tkcitegk expression driven cmv promoter induced cell killing more
effectively sm22alpha ef1alpha promoters primary vsmcs. based upon
these vitro findings, tkcitegk vectors cmv promoter tested two 
animal models cardiovascular disease: balloon angioplasty stent deployment
in pig arteries. following vascular injury, expression cmv-tkcitegk gcv
significantly reduced vsmc proliferation intimal lesion formation compared to
control vectors gcv. angioplasty model, 80% reduction in
intima-to-media area ratio (p = 0.0002). findings paralleled a
stent model 66% reduction intimal lesions (p = 0.006). coexpression gk
with tk increases cell killing permits administration gcv lower doses. 
these modifications tkcitegk vectors gcv showed enhanced efficacy lower
prodrug doses, leading improved safety cardiovascular gene therapy.
