background: studies suggested hiv-1 may develop thymidine analogue
mutations (tams) one two distinct pathways - tam1 pathway (including
mutations 41l, 210w 215y) tam2 pathway (including mutations 67n, 70r
and 219e/q) - pressure fully suppressive
thymidine-analogue-containing regimen.
methods: frozen plasma samples stored eurosida repository selected
and sent two central laboratories genotypic analysis. considered 733
patients least one genotypic test showing > =1 tams (the first of
these tests chronological order used). tam1 tam2 genotypic profiles
were defined accordance previous literature. statistical modelling
involved logistic regression linear regression analysis censored data.
results: observed frequencies patterns classifiable tam1 tam2
profiles markedly higher probabilities falling these
classifications chance alone. chance detecting tam2 profile increased
by 25% per additional year exposure zidovudine. found mutations 67n
and 184v associated particular tam profile. presence of
tam2 profiles, adjusted mean difference 6-month viral reduction was
0.96 log10 copies/ml (95% confidence interval: 0.20; 1.73) higher patients who
started stavudine-containing regimens instead zidovudine-containing regimens.
conclusions: study provides evidence suggested tam clustering 
real phenomenon may driven thymidine analogue the
patients used. patients tam2-resistant viruses, stavudine appears 
retain greater viral activity zidovudine.
