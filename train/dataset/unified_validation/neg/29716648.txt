cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (cyhv-3) archetypal fish alloherpesvirus the
etiologic agent lethal disease common koi carp. date, genome
sequences four cyhv-3 isolates published, comparisons of
the biologic properties strains reported. sequenced
the genomes seven strains various geographical sources, and
have compared growth vitro virulence vivo. major findings
were: (i) existence two genetic lineages previously described as
european asian confirmed, inconsistencies geographic
origin genotype strains revealed; (ii) potential inter-lineage
recombination detected one strain, also suggested existence a
third, yet unidentified lineage; (iii) analysis genetic disruptions led 
the identification non-essential genes potential role virulence; 
(iv) comparison vitro vivo properties strains belonging to
the two lineages revealed inter-lineage polymorphisms contribute to
the differences viral fitness observed; (v) negative correlation was
observed among strains viral growth vitro virulence vivo. 
study illustrates importance coupling genomic biologic comparisons 
viral strains order enhance understanding viral evolution and
pathogenesis.
