polymerase chain reaction (pcr) according method described okamoto et al.
before renal transplantation. one positive for
hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag), one positive anti-hepatitis c virus 
(hcv) 45 negative hbsag anti-hcv. ttv-dna was
detected 22 47 patients renal transplantation, nine became
positive transplantation. 47 patients showed normal level alt
before transplantation. three nine (33%) became positive ttv-dna after
transplantation three 16 (19%) negative ttv-dna and
after transplantation showed transient elevation alt. results indicate
that ttv highly prevalent among renal transplant recipients, clear
