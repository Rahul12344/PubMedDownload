a multiplex reverse transcription (rt)-pcr method developed is
capable detecting subtyping influenza (h1n1 h3n2) b viruses as
well respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) types b respiratory clinical
samples taken part national community-based surveillance program of
influenza-like illness england wales. detection different
pathogen depended distinguishing five amplification products different
sizes agarose gels following rt-pcr multiple primer sets. multiplex
rt-pcr tested 65 nasopharyngeal apirates rsv been
isolated 237 combined nose throat swabs influenza (h1n1 
h3n2) b virus detected virus isolation, well 40 respiratory 
samples viruses including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus,
enteroviruses, parainfluenza viruses grown. typing and
subtyping influenza b viruses rsv types b, multiplex
rt-pcr gave excellent (100%) correlation results conventional
typing subtyping specific antisera. multiplex rt-pcr also used to
accurately detect one viral template reaction mixture,
allowing viral coinfections identified respiratory specimen.
