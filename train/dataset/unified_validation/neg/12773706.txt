recent reports indicated norepinephrine (ne) enhances hiv replication
in infected monocytes promotes increased expression select matrix
metalloproteinases associated dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) vitro in
co-cultures hiv-infected leukocytes human cardiac microvascular
endothelial cells (hmvec-c). influence ne hiv infection and
leukocyte-endothelial interactions suggests pathogenic role aids-related
cardiovascular disease. study examined effects norepinephrine (ne)
and hiv-1 infection leukocyte adhesion hmvec-c. flow static
conditions examined expression selected adhesion molecules and
cytokines monitored parallel. ne pretreatment resulted detectable,
dose-dependent increase leukocyte-endothelial adhesion (lea) both
hiv-1-infected -uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs)
relative media controls 48 hr co-culture hmvec-c vitro.
however, combination ne plus hiv infection resulted significant (p < 
0.0001) 18-fold increase lea uninfected media controls. increased levels 
in cell-associated -soluble icam-1 e-selectin vcam-1
correlated increased lea hiv-1 infection ne pretreatment.
blocking antibodies specific icam-1 e-selectin inhibited hiv-ne-induced
lea. data suggest model ne primes hiv-1-infected leukocytes 
enhanced adhesion localization hmvec-c initiate and
participate vascular injury associated aids-related cardiomyopathy.
