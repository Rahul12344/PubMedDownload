since 1999, 11 serotypes bluetongue virus (btv) similar central american or
caribbean strains isolated southeastern united states,
predominantly florida. majority incursive serotypes remained
restricted southeastern us. recent years, btv serotype 3 (btv-3) has
been isolated areas increasingly distant florida. current study uses 
whole genome sequencing recent historical btv-3 isolates us,
central america caribbean additional sequences genbank to
conduct phylogenetic analyses. individual segments btv genome were
analysed determine recent btv-3 isolates reassortants containing
genomic segments endemic us serotypes retain majority of
central american/caribbean genotypes. analyses indicate btv-3 isolates
mississippi 2006, arkansas 2008 mississippi 2009 closely related
reassortants contain five six genomic segments us origin 
two three segments central american/caribbean origin. contrast, the
btv-3 south dakota 2012 isolate contains seven genomic segments more
similar isolates central american caribbean. different
evolutionary histories btv-3 isolates suggest least two 
different lineages btv-3 currently circulating us.
