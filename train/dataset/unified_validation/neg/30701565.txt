the secretion interferon-α (ifn-α) impaired hepatitis b virus (hbv) 
infection. dna sequences purified distinct viruses, example, hbv versus 
members herpesviridae, shown differ ifn-α signaling
properties. present study found dna hbv inhibited, dna from
members herpesviridae induced, expression ifn-α. furthermore,
stimulatory cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (cpg) sequences derived dna
viruses could induce secretion ifn-α, inhibitory
guanosine-rich oligodeoxynucleoti (polyg) oligonucleotide sequences derived 
these dna viruses could inhibit cpg-induced ifn-α secretion. using a
computational analysis genomic dna sequences, discrimination the
genomes hbv dna viruses also cause inflammation of
the liver based different frequencies cpg polyg motifs. the
underrepresentation stimulatory cpg motifs overrepresentation of
inhibitory polyg motifs documented hbv genomes, whereas dna from
other viral genomes displayed opposite trend. moreover, demonstrated
that hbv could suppress activation ifn-α via dna high 
proportion polyg motifs. knowledge, first demonstration 
a specific role polyg motifs inhibition ifn-α response
following dna virus infection.
