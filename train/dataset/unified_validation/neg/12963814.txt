we coinfected rhesus macaques cxc chemokine receptor 4- cc chemokine
receptor 5-specific simian/human immunodeficiency viruses (shivs) elucidate
the basis early dominance r5-tropic strains seen hiv-infected
humans. found intrinsic barrier transmission dissemination of
high-dose x4-shiv dually infected macaques. animals maintained a
viral set point, r5 virus predominated. time appearance r5
dominance coincided development virus-specific immunity (3-6 weeks
postinfection), suggestive differential immune control two viruses.
indeed, depletion cd8+ cells coinfected animals, x4 virus
emerged, supporting concept differential cd8+ cell-mediated immune
control x4- r5-shiv replication responsible selective outgrowth
of r5 viruses. findings provide critical insights key question
related hiv pathogenesis important implications development
and testing antiviral vaccines therapeutics.
