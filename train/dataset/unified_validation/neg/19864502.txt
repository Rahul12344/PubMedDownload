effective disinfectants key importance safe handling and
reprocessing surgical instruments. study tested whether new formulations 
containing sds, naoh 1-propanol (n-propanol) simultaneously active
against broad range pathogens including bacteria, fungi, non-enveloped
viruses prions. inactivation disinfection examined suspension and
on carriers, using coagulated blood brain homogenate organic
contaminant. coomassie blue staining used assess whether formulations 
undesirably fixed proteins rough surfaces. mixture 0.2 % sds 0.3 %
naoh 20 % n-propanol achieved potent decontamination steel carriers
contaminated prp(tse), biochemical marker prion infectivity, from
263k scrapie hamsters patients sporadic variant creutzfeldt-jakob
disease. 263k scrapie infectivity carriers decreased > =5.5 logs.
furthermore, formulation effectively inactivated poliovirus, hepatitis a
virus caliciviruses (including murine norovirus) suspension tests. also
yielded significant titre reductions bacteria (enterococcus faecium,
mycobacterium avium; >6 logs), fungi (spores aspergillus niger; > =5 logs) 
and poliovirus (>4 logs) embedded coagulated blood carriers. the
formulation found fix proteins observed water as
the cleaning reagent. conclusion, sds, naoh n-propanol synergistically
achieve fast, broad-range disinfection.
