african swine fever (asf) caused swine industry russian federation
substantial economic losses last 7 years, disease spread from
there number neighbouring countries. wild boar involved the
spread disease local transboundary levels. understanding
asf dynamics wild boars prerequisite preventing spread to
designing applying effective surveillance control plans. reproductive
ratio (r0 ) epidemiological indicator commonly used quantify extent 
of disease spread. here, estimated nine spatio-temporal clusters asf
in wild boar cases russian federation (2007-2013). clusters defined
by exploring maximum distance association asf cases using k ripley
analysis spatio-temporal scan statistics. maximum spatial association of
133 km wild boar cases identified within de conventional
radius surveillance zone (100-150 km). mean range value r0  = 1.58
(1.13-3.77) lower compared values previously estimated asf
transmission within farms similar early estimates farm (r0
 = 2-3), domestic pigs using notification data russian federation.
results obtained provide quantitative knowledge epidemiology asf in
wild boars russian federation. identify asf transmission rate
value affected natural wild populations, first time, could
provide basis modelling asf transmission suggest current
surveillance radius reviewed make surveillance wild nature more
targeted effective.
