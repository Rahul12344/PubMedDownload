adenovirus protein vii major protein component viral nucleoprotein 
core. highly basic, estimated 1070 copies associate viral 
genome, forming tightly condensed dna-protein complex. investigated dna
condensation, transcriptional repression, specific protein binding protein
vii. xenopus oocytes microinjected mrna encoding ha-tagged protein vii 
and prepared visualization lampbrush chromosomes. immunostaining revealed 
that protein vii associated uniform manner across entire chromosomes.
furthermore, chromosomes significantly condensed transcriptionally
silenced, judged dramatic disappearance transcription loops
characteristic lampbrush chromosomes. infection, protein vii-dna
complex may initial substrate transcriptional activation cellular
factors viral e1a protein. investigate possibility, mrnas
encoding e1a protein vii comicroinjected xenopus oocytes.
interestingly, whereas e1a associate chromosomes absence of
protein vii, expression proteins together resulted significant
association e1a lampbrush chromosomes. binding studies proteins
produced bacteria human cells vitro translation showed e1a
and protein vii interact vitro. structure-function analysis revealed 
an n-terminal region e1a responsible binding protein vii. these
studies define vivo functions protein vii dna binding, condensation,
and transcriptional repression indicate role e1a-mediated
transcriptional activation viral genes.
