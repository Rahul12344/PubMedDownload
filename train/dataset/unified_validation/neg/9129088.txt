the effects pentoxifylline immunologic virologic parameters were
evaluated 10 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients receiving
antiretroviral treatment. patients asymptomatic, 300-500 cd4
cells/microl, received pentoxifylline (1200 mg/day orally) 4 months.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells tested five time points
during therapy. transient increase cd4 cells observed 8 9
patients, cd8 cells increased 7 9 patients. increases were
negatively correlated susceptibility vitro mitogen-stimulated
apoptotic cell death. pentoxifylline temporary effect mitogen-stimulated
cytokine production; thus, interferon-gamma, interleukin (il)-2, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, lymphotoxin increased il-10. pentoxifylline also
potentiated antigen-stimulated il-2 production proliferation 8 9
patients induced significant transient decreases plasma viremia 7
of 9 patients. preliminary findings suggest pentoxifylline vivo has
an interesting temporary influence immunologic virologic
parameters.
