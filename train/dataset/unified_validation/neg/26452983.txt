background aims: haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct)
with add-back donor lymphocytes expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine 
kinase suicide gene (tk cells) one widely applied promising new
gene therapy approaches. however, immunological status added-back tk cells
after hsct yet well characterized.
methods: investigated tk cells use flow cytometry, t-cell
receptor (tcr) vβ repertoire spectratyping linear amplification-mediated
polymerase chain reaction followed insertion site analysis patient
enrolled clinical trial.
results: comparison onset remission acute graft-versus-host disease 
confirmed tk cells predominantly eliminated proliferative
cd8(+) non-tk cells also depleted response ganciclovir administration.
the tcr vβ-chain repertoire tk cells non-tk cells markedly changed
after administration ganciclovir, and, whereas tcr repertoire non-tk
cells returned normal spectratype long transplantation, tk
cells remained skewed. long-term prophylactic administration of
acyclovir, tk cells oligoclonally expanded frequency spliced variants 
of tk cells increased. known cancer-associated genes evident near the
oligoclonally expanded herpes simplex virus (hsv)-tk insertion sites.
conclusions: demonstrate obvious differences immunological status between
tk cells non-tk cells. addition, speculate long-term prophylactic 
administration acyclovir increases risk oligoclonal expansion of
spliced forms tk cells.
