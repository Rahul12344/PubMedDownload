the new human-human hybridoma trd3 secretes cytotoxic igm mab, reacted
with 28 panel 56 hla-typed lymphoblastoid cells. 28 trd3+ cells
expressed hla-b supertype bw6, whereas 10 bw6+ cells recognized by
the mab. none 17 bw4 homozygous cells positive trd3. thus, trd3 
divided bw6+ hla-b specificities cell lines two subgroups,
namely, bw6+trd3+ bw6+trd3-, therefore defines new hla-b supertype.
trd3 reacted strongly b8+ cell lines weakly with
others, suggesting new split hla-b8. compared cell lines, trd3 reacted 
more weakly freshly isolated cells blood. bw6-specific rat mab
sfr8-b6 partially blocked binding 125i-labeled trd3 bw6+ cell line.
by using cell lines transfected hybrid genes hla-b7 (bw6+) and
hla-b27 (bw6-) targets flow cytometry, critical residues trd3
epitope could mapped amino acid region 24-62 hla class-i alpha 1
domain. comparison deduced amino acid sequences trd3-positive -negative
cells indicated tryptophane residue position 95 destroyed trd3
epitope, one residues positions 24, 45, 46 may 
critical, suggesting discontinuous epitope. notable none 
of residues located alpha-helixes.(abstract truncated 250 words)
