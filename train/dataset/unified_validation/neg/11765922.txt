rat cytomegalovirus (rcmv) open reading frame r44 homolog human
cytomegalovirus gene ul44, encodes dna polymerase accessory protein.
here, show r44 transcribed 3.6-kb mrna within early late 
phases infection vitro. order find potential monoclonal antibodies
(moabs) directed r44-encoded protein (pr44), panel anti-rcmv
moabs screened binding pr44 recombinant proteins. thus, anti-pr44
moab, termed rcmv8, identified. using moab, pr44 could detected as
early 8 h rcmv infection vitro. pr44 protein determined to
have molecular mass approximately 55 kda found localized to
the nucleus rcmv-infected cells.
