viral vectors commonly used method gene therapy highly
efficient transduction cells. however, many vectors small genetic
capacity, potential immunogenicity limit usefulness.
moreover, disorders central nervous system (cns), need for
invasive surgical delivery viruses brain also detracts their
clinical applicability. here, show intranasal delivery unimolecularly 
compacted dna nanoparticles (dna nps), consist single molecules of
plasmid dna encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) compacted with
10â€‰kda polyethylene glycol (peg)-substituted lysine 30-mers (ck30peg10k),
successfully transfect cells rat brain. direct egfp fluorescence
microscopy, egfp-immunohistochemistry (ihc) egfp-elisa demonstrated egfp 
protein expression 2 days intranasal delivery. egfp-positive cells were
found throughout rostral-caudal axis brain, often adjacent to
capillary endothelial cells. localization provides evidence distribution
of nasally administered dna nps via perivascular flow. results 
first report intranasal delivery dna nps bypass blood-brain
barrier transfect express encoded protein rat brain, affording
a non-invasive approach gene therapy cns disorders.
