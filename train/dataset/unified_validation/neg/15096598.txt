to determine whether antilipogenic actions insulin-induced gene 1
(insig-1) demonstrated cultured preadipocytes also occur vivo, infected 
zucker diabetic fatty (zdf) (fa/fa) rats, recombinant adenovirus containing 
insig-1 -2 cdna. increase proteins appeared livers. in
control zdf (fa/fa) rats infected adenovirus containing the
beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) cdna, triacylglycerols liver plasma rose
steeply whereas insig-infected rats exhibited substantial attenuation 
increase hepatic steatosis hyperlipidemia. insig overexpression was
associated striking reduction elevated level nuclear sterol
regulatory element-binding protein (srebp)-1c, activated form the
transcription factor. mrna srebp-1c lipogenic target enzymes also fell.
the mrna endogenous insig-1, -2a -2b, higher fatty
livers untreated obese zdf (fa/fa) rats compared controls, the
elevation sufficient block approximately 3-fold increase in
srebp-1c expression activity. normal animals, adenovirus-induced
overexpression insigs reduced increase srebp-1c mrna target
enzymes caused refeeding. findings demonstrated insigs have
antilipogenic action transgenically overexpressed livers increased
srebp-1c-mediated lipogenesis. however, increase endogenous insig-1
expression associated augmented lipogenesis may limit it, is
insufficient prevent it.
