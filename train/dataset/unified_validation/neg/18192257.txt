purpose: treatment options viral myocarditis caused coxsackievirus b
are summarized.
summary: myocarditis common cause dilated cardiomyopathy. common
causes infectious myocarditis viruses. exact mechanism of
coxsackievirus b-induced damage myocytes unknown. likely mechanisms
involve immune-mediated direct viral cytotoxicity. several proposed
treatment strategies target specific points pathway myocarditis 
to cardiomyopathy. immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, prednisone, and
cyclosporine) treatment myocarditis seem logical, since one the
mechanisms thought contribute myocarditis autoimmune destruction.
another treatment option viral myocarditis intravenous immunoglobulin
(ivig). conventional immunosuppressive strategies, ivig suppresses the
immune response. addition, ivig may replace antibodies, enhance viral
clearance, neutralize pathogens, enhance clearance inflammatory cytokines 
that contribute myocytes destruction. antiviral agents, interferons,
pleconaril, acyclovir, target causative organism, possibly halting the
cascade myocyte destruction. natural products particular interest the
treatment viral myocarditis astragalus membranaceus ardisia chinensis.
there specific therapy patients viral myocarditis dilated
cardiomyopathy. general, patients dilated cardiomyopathy benefit
from agents commonly used heart failure, since symptoms presentation
are similar.
conclusion: immunosuppressive agents, ivig, antiviral agents, natural
medicines used treatment patients myocarditis. however, 
the efficacy agents well established, partly because
research differentiated infectious noninfectious myocarditis.
this makes difficult extrapolate study results viral myocarditis.
