it widely recognized mitochondrial dysfunction, notably defects in
the nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (complex i), closely related etiology
of sporadic parkinson's disease (pd). fact, rotenone, complex inhibitor,
has used establishing pd models vitro vivo. rat model
with chronic rotenone exposure seems reproduce pathophysiological conditions
of pd closely acute mouse models manifested neuronal cell death
in substantia nigra lewy body-like cytosolic aggregations. using the
rotenone rat model, investigated protective effects alternative nadh
dehydrogenase (ndi1) previously demonstrated act replacement for
complex vitro vivo. single, unilateral injection of
recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying ndi1 gene vicinity of
the substantia nigra resulted expression ndi1 protein entire
substantia nigra side. clear introduction ndi1
protein substantia nigra rendered resistance deleterious effects
caused rotenone exposure assessed levels tyrosine hydroxylase and
dopamine. presence ndi1 protein also prevented cell death and
oxidative damage dna dopaminergic neurons observed rotenone-treated
rats. unilateral protection also led uni-directional rotation the
rotenone-exposed rats behavioral test. present study shows, the
first time, powerful neuroprotective effect offered ndi1 enzyme a
rotenone rat model pd.
