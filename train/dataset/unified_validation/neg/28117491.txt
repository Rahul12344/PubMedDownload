age-dependent susceptibility nervous necrosis virus (nnv) demonstrated for
barramundi (lates calcarifer). experiment used juvenile barramundi produced
from single spawning challenged consecutively immersion a
redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (rgnnv) isolate. dose and
environmental conditions (35 ppt salinity 30 °c) constant. fish and
water sampled longitudinally histopathology rt-qpcr analysis to
examine evolution disease, virus replication, immune response and
release virus water. viral nervous necrosis (vnn) disease occurred in
barramundi challenged 3 4 weeks age fish challenged 5, 7 and
9 weeks age developed subclinical infection. replication nnv occurred
faster concentration virus reached higher concentrations the
younger fish clinical disease. virus isolation qpcr tests indicated that
infectious nnv released carcasses water fish affected
with clinical disease nnv infection subclinical. based 
observations, consider carcasses clinically infected fish a
potentially important role horizontal transmission nnv, barramundi 
juveniles protected exposure nnv 5 weeks age 
and reach disease resistance threshold.
