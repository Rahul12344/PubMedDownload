partial nucleotide sequences amplification products obtained four
european apple stem grooving virus (asgv) isolates using degenerate primers
showed 80 85% similarity published asgv sequence japanese strain
but 98 100% identities among themselves. based sequences, two
asgv-specific primers (asgv4f-asgv4r) designed amplify 574-bp fragment 
located putative viral rna polymerase. primers, six european
and five american asgv isolates, maintained herbaceous hosts (chenopodium
quinoa, nicotiana glutinosa, n. occidentalis) apple trees, readily
detected reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). using these
specific asgv primers, dsrna preparations shown constitute good
templates reliable amplification asgv sequences leaves bark
tissues apple trees, two-step rt-pcr protocol one-step
titan one-tube rt-pcr. system. furthermore, one-step rt-pcr system allowed 
specific amplification asgv sequences directly clarified crude extracts
of leaves bark tissues apple trees active growth the
