the nucleocapsid (nc) protein human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 (ncp7) is
responsible packaging viral rna recognizing packaging site (psi) 
the viral rna genome. ncp7 molecule 55 amino acids containing two zinc
fingers, first one highly conserved among retroviruses. the
first zinc finger flanked two basic amino acid clusters. we
demonstrate chemically synthesized ncp7 specifically binds viral rna
containing psi using competitive filter binding assays. deletion psi
from rna abrogates effect. 35 n-terminal amino acids ncp7,
comprising first zinc finger, sufficient specific rna binding.
chemically synthesized mutants first zinc finger demonstrate the
amino acid residues c-c-c/h-c/h required specific rna binding zinc
coordination. amino acid residues f16 t24, k20, e21 g22, located 
within zinc finger, essential specific rna binding well. the
second zinc finger cannot replace first one. furthermore, mutations the
basic amino acid residues flanking first zinc finger demonstrate r3, 7, 
10, 29 32 k11, 14, 33 34 also essential specific binding.
specific binding viral rna also observed recombinant ncp15 and
pr55gag. results demonstrate first time specific interaction a
retroviral nc protein psi rna vitro.
