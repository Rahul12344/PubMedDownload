objective: observe presence epstin-barr virus (ebv) expression of
p53 p16 non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl) occurring nasal cavity and
pharyngeal waldeyer's ring.
methods: situ hybridization used detect ebv-dna p16-mrna and
immunohistochemical staining used examine expression lmp1, p53 
p16 36 cases. five cases whose ebv-dna negative first assay by
hybridization re-detected ebv-dna pcr.
results: positive expression rates ebv-dna, lmp1, p16 mrna, p53 p16 were
63.9%, 27.8%, 30.6%, 19.4% 22.2%. p53 p16 expressions not
significantly different cell nhl b cell nhl, them
significantly different ebv positive negative cases.
conclusion: higher percentage ebv infection detected nasal cavity
and pharyngeal waldeyer's ring nhl. ebv infection significantly
associated p53 p16 expresions nhl.
