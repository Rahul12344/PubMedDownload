purpose: purpose study test whether basic fibroblast growth
factor (bfgf) participates arterialized vein graft remodeling.
methods: rabbits underwent vivo gene transfer carotid interposition vein
grafting. segments external jugular vein infected adenovirus that
expressed antisense bfgf rna (ad.asbfgf) 1 x 10(10) pfu/ml inhibit new
synthesis bfgf cells vein graft wall. control rabbits treated
with either adenovirus encoded beta-galactosidase (ad.lacz) 1 x 10(10)
pfu/ml vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline solution [pbs]). 3 days, 3 grafts
per treatment group harvested determination gene expression of
asbfgf rna reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. rabbits were
killed, perfusion fixed 2 months grafting. total wall thickness
and lumen circumference vein grafts normal arteries measured cross
sections. calculated mean tangential stress (+/-sd) asbfgf-treated group 
and controls compared significance. grafts immunohistochemically
stained assess bfgf protein production.
results: grafts infected ad.asbfgf gene expressed asbfgf rna.
grafts treated ad.asbfgf displayed lower tangential stress (10.9
+/- 2.3 dynes/cm(2)) pbs alone (22 +/- 2.8 dynes/cm(2)) ad. lacz-treated 
controls (20.6 +/- 5.4 dynes/cm(2); p <.001). tangential stress ad.asbfgf 
group comparable normal carotid artery (13.9 +/- 2.1 dynes/cm(2)). the
difference mean total wall thickness significant among 3 treatment
groups: ad.asbfgf, 164 +/- 3.4 microm); ad.lacz, 100 +/- 3.3 microm; pbs, 96 
+/- 3.6 microm; p <.01). luminal circumference different among the
groups. ad.asbfgf-treated vein graft wall composed thick layers of
concentric smooth muscle cells elastin fibers contrast sponge-like 
appearance observed control arterialized vein grafts. reduction bfgf
protein noted ad.asbfgf-treated group.
conclusion: inhibition bfgf synthesis vivo use adenoviral gene 
transfer antisense rna bfgf promotes vein graft decreased tangential
stress maintaining luminal area. vein graft wall remodeled and
qualitatively resembles artery wall tangential stress ad.asbfgf and
normal artery significantly different. lack significant difference
in lumen circumference among groups suggests wall thickening ad.
asbfgf grafts expense luminal narrowing. results suggest
that asbfgf rna expression may represent effective strategy limiting the
failure arterialized venous conduits.
