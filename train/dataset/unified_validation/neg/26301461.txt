foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) major constraint transboundary trade in
animal products, yet much natural ecology epidemiology endemic
regions still poorly understood. address gap, multidisciplinary,
molecular conventional epidemiological approach applied an
investigation endemic fmd vietnam. within study space, found
that 22.3% sampled ruminants previously infected fmd virus
(fmdv), 10.8% persistent, asymptomatic carriers (2.4% total 
population). descriptive data collected targeted surveillance farm
questionnaire showed significantly lower prevalence fmdv infection dairy
farms. contrast, farms intermediate size and/or history infection in
2010 increased risk fmd exposure. individual animal level,
buffalo highest exposure risk (over cattle), spatial
heterogeneity exposure risk commune level. conversely, carrier
prevalence higher beef cattle, suggesting lower susceptibility buffalo
to persistent fmdv infection. characterize virus strains currently circulating
in vietnam, partial fmdv genomic (vp1) sequences carrier animals collected
between 2012 2013 (n = 27) fmdv outbreaks 2009 2013
(n = 79) compared phylogenetic analysis. sequence analysis suggested that
within study period, two apparent novel introductions serotype 
a viruses dominant lineage serotype vietnam shifted from
sea/mya-98 me-sa/panasia. fmdv strains shared close ancestors fmdv from
other south-east asian countries indicating substantial transboundary movement of
the predominant circulating strains. close genetic relationships observed
between carrier outbreak viruses, may suggest asymptomatic
carriers fmdv contribute regional disease persistence. multiple viral
sequences obtained carrier cattle 1-year period considerable
within-animal genetic variation, indicating within-host virus evolution.
