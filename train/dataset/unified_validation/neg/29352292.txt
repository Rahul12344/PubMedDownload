kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) etiologic agent kaposi's
sarcoma (ks). endemic number sub-saharan african countries with
infection rate >50%. high prevalence hiv-1 coupled late
presentation advanced cancer staging make ks leading cancer region 
with poor prognosis high mortality. disease markers cellular functions
associated ks tumorigenesis remain ill-defined. several studies have
attempted investigate changes gene profile vitro infection of
monoculture models, likely reflect cellular complexity of
the vivo lesion environment. approach characterize compare the
gene expression profile ks lesions versus non-cancer tissues same
individual. comparisons could identify pathways critical ks formation
and maintenance. first study utilized high throughput rna-seq to
characterize viral cellular transcriptome tumor non-cancer
biopsies african epidemic ks patients. patients treated
anti-retroviral therapy undetectable hiv-1 plasma viral load. found
remarkable variability viral transcriptome among patients, with
viral latency immune modulation genes abundantly expressed. presence
of kshv also significantly affected cellular transcriptome profile.
specifically, genes involved lipid glucose metabolism disorder pathways
were substantially affected. moreover, infiltration immune cells the
tumor prevent ks formation, suggesting functional deficits 
cells. lastly, found minimal overlaps vivo cellular
transcriptome dataset vitro studies, reflecting limitation
of vitro models representing tumor lesions. findings could lead to
the identification diagnostic therapeutic markers ks, provide
bases mechanistic studies functions viral cellular
genes involved.
