shigella infections account considerable burden acute diarrheal diseases
worldwide remain major cause childhood mortality developing
countries. although, four species shigella (s. dysenteriae, s. flexneri,
s. boydii, s. sonnei) cause bacillary dysentery, historically s.
dysenteriae type 1 recognized carrying genes shiga toxin
(stx). recent epidemiological data, however, suggested emergence of
stx carrying s. flexneri strains may originated bacteriophage-mediated 
inter-species horizontal gene transfer one specific geographical area,
hispaniola. test hypothesis, analyzed whole genome sequences of
stx-encoding phages carried s. flexneri strains isolated haiti s.

phylogenetic analysis showed phage sequences encoded shigella strains

dysenteriae type 1 shigella species, s. flexneri, spans the
