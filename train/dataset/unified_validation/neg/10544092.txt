intramuscular injection bacterially derived plasmid dna results the
development humoral cellular immune responses plasmid-encoded
antigens. immunostimulatory cpg sequences within bacterial dna thought to
enhance process stimulating secretion proinflammatory cytokines
such interferon gamma (ifngamma) cells innate immune system.
although ifngamma induction cpg elements within plasmid dna been
documented vitro recently vivo, coimmunization plasmids
expressing ifngamma shown enhance dna-immunization-induced immune
responses, unclear ifngamma necessary successful dna
immunization. address issue, compared humoral cellular immune
responses wild-type ifngamma-deficient mice vaccinated plasmid
(pcmvnp) expressing nucleoprotein gene arenavirus lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (lcmv). ifngamma-positive (balb/c) ifngamma-negative
(gko) mice responded dna vaccination development antigen-specific
cd8(+) cells, detectable directly ex vivo intracellular cytokine 
staining comprised 0.7-2.5% cd8(+) cells vaccine. dna
vaccines also induced virus-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl), even the
absence ifngamma. dna vaccination mouse strains also associated
with significant reduction viral titers lcmv challenge, indicating
that, least presence immune effector mechanisms, ifngamma is
not required induction protective anti-viral immunity dna immunization.
no quantitative differences observed antiviral igg levels among gko and
balb/c vaccinees, although gko mice exhibit significant reduction the
igg2a:igg1 ratio, agreement previously documented requirement for
ifngamma isotype switching igg2a. immunized balb/c mice produced similar
levels igg1 igg2a, indicating mixed th1/th2 response to
intramuscular immunization pcmvnp. results show ifngamma
induction bacterially derived plasmid dna contribute magnitude
of antibody response required induction short-term
maintenance dna-induced ctl. however, ifngamma necessary the
development igg2a antibodies may crucial protection some
pathogens.
