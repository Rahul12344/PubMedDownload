previous studies demonstrated coinfection hpgv protective
factor human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients, leading to
slower disease progression, longer survival established disease. the
present study sought estimate prevalence hpgv infection associated 
risk factors patients harboring c non-c hiv-1 subtypes followed-up at
hu-furg, southern brazil. samples 347 hiv-1-infected subjects subjected
to plasma rna extraction, cdna synthesis, hpgv rna detection, hiv-1
genotyping. overall prevalence hpgv rna 34%. individuals aged 18-30
years higher chances infection compared 50 years older
(95%ci 1.18-52.36, p = 0.03). number sexual partner one three 
was risk factor hpgv infection (95%ci 1.54-10.23; p < 0.01), well the
time since diagnosis hiv-1 ≥ 11 years (95%ci 1.01-2.89; p = 0.04). patients
infected hiv non-c subtypes six times chance hpgv-infected
when compared subtype c-infected subjects (95%ci 2.28-14.78; p < 0.01). this
was first study conducted southern brazil find circulation hpgv.
hiv/hpgv coinfection associated longer survival among hiv+ patients.
of novelty, individuals infected hiv non-c subtypes susceptible to
hpgv infection. however, additional studies needed correlate hiv-1
subtypes hpgv infection clarify cellular molecular pathways
through associations ruled. j. med. virol 88:2106-2114, 2016. ©
