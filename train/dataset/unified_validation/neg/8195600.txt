hla-disease associations may important understanding pathogenesis of
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection. therefore, 106 homosexual 
men amsterdam cohort study aids known date hiv-1
seroconversion serologically typed hla. several significant associations
between hla type pathogenic features hiv-1 infection observed:
subjects fever skin rash primary hiv-1 infection showed an
increased frequency hla-b62 (relative risk [rr], 5.8; p = .005). frequency
of hla-b35 increased subjects rapid decline cd4+ lymphocytes
(rr, 3.2; p = .021). kaplan-meier survival analysis revealed significant
association hla-b35 decrease cd4+ cells < 200/microl (p =
.01). strongest association found hla-dr1 aids-related
kaposi's sarcoma (rr, 22.5; p < .001), also confirmed survival analysis (p =
.001). aids patients opportunistic infections, increased frequencies
of hla-dr3 (p = .011) -dq2 (p = .007) observed. finally, occurrence 
of syncytium-inducing hiv-1 variants significantly associated hla-dq2 (p
= .01).
