background: natural history hepatitis c virus (hcv) carriers the
effect ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) fully elucidated among
hemodialysis (hd) patients.
methods: eighty-four anti-hcv antibody- hcv rna-positive 154 anti-hcv
antibody-negative hd patients retrospectively observed least 3
years analyzed. investigated factors associated thrombocytopenia
(< 1.3 x 10(5)/microl) decreased platelet count (plt) (more 20% decrease
during follow-up period), considered indicators hepatic
fibrosis. addition, another 16 hd patients hcv received 300 mg/day
udca orally least 6 months investigated. changes alanine
aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (ggt) plt assessed.
results: 60.3-months mean follow-up period, hcv infection was
independently associated thrombocytopenia [odds ratio (or) 2.589] and
decreased plt (or 2.339) 238 hd patients. 84 hd patients hcv, the
average alt levels (> = 15 iu/l) follow-up period associated
with thrombocytopenia (or 3.882) decreased plt (or 4.470). addition, alt, 
ast ggt significantly decreased 6 months starting udca, plt 
not change 16 hd patients hcv.
conclusions: results indicate hcv infection risk for
thrombocytopenia associated hepatic fibrosis hd patients.
in addition, clinical course alt levels predicts progression of
thrombocytopenia, udca may effectively lower alt levels hd patients with
hcv.
