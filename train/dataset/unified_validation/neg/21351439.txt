cycloheximide (chx) inhibits protein synthesis eukaryotic cells is
a well-known tool commonly used biochemical research. paper, the
antiviral spectrum chx several dna rna viruses been
evaluated. chx showed strong inhibitory activities several rna viruses
such hiv-1, influenza viruses, coxsackie b virus, enterovirus (ev71) and
several dna viruses hsv hcmv. especially strong inhibitory
activities chx coxsackie b virus enterovirus caught attention,
since effective drugs available clinic limited. sar chx derivatives
also discussed paper. hydroxyl group c-2' carbonyl
group c-2" chx essential antiviral activity. modification
to groups results derivatives' antiviral activities reduced lost.
