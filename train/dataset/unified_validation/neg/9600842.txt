x-ray fiber diffraction potentially powerful solving atomic structure
of filamentous assemblies macromolecules, demonstrated tobacco mosaic
virus. however, requires extremely well-oriented sols allow extraction 
of intensities closely located layer-lines. high degree orientation
requires high filament concentration restrain orientational freedom, but
orienting concentrated sols hampered high viscosity. here, report 
a systematic method reproducibly produces extremely good orientation, 
involves three steps; liquid crystallization, centrifugation magnetic
orientation. found slow centrifugation trigger dynamic
self-orientation process form perfectly homogeneous liquid-crystalline sols,
and centrifugation concentrate sols followed magnetic orientation
produces exceptionally well-oriented sols. best-oriented flagellar sol showed
a disorientation angle 0.6 degrees 1sigma gaussian distribution. the
new method successfully applied many systems, tobacco
mosaic virus f-actin.
