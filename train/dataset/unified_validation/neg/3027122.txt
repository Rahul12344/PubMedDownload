lansing poliovirus infection mice: antibody demonstrable enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) immunoprecipitation neutralization.

jubelt b, lipton h.

adult mice infected intracerebrally (i.c) lansing strain type 2 human
poliovirus (hpv2) failed develop systemic neutralizing antibody response
until 2 months post-infection (p.i). contrast, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (elisa) demonstrated antibody response igm igg classes beginning 
at day 1 p.i. peak levels reached 5 weeks p.i. response slightly
greater paralyzed nonparalyzed animals. immunoprecipitation of
poliovirus proteins cytoplasmic extracts disrupted purified virion
preparations revealed antibodies three capsid proteins, two capsid precursor
proteins, one nonstructural protein. finally, neither neutralizing antibody
nor definite virus replication detected oral, intraperitoneal, or
intravenous routes inoculation. conclude lack systemic
neutralizing antibody response mice probably due insufficient amount 
of infectious virus consequently viral neutralizing epitopes reaching
extraneural lymphoid tissues.
