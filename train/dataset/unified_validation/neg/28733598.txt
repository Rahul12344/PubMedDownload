histone deacetylase 9 (hdac9) regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis deacetylating 
forkhead box 1 (foxo1). hdac9 upregulation involved hepatitis c virus
(hcv)-associated exaggerated gluconeogenesis. herein, found addition to
foxo1, hdac9 also regulates gluconeogenic transcription factors, including 
peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (pgc-1α), cyclic
amp-responsive element-binding protein (creb), glucocorticoid receptor (gr). 
unlike foxo1, regulated post-translational modification responses 
hdac9, hdac9 regulates pgc-1α, creb gr altering gene expression. similar
to pgc-1α, creb gr found novel regulatory targets foxo1 by
examination foxo1 binding site promoter. pgc-1α, creb gr were
upregulated response hdac9 via foxo1 deacetylation. findings indicate
that hdac9-foxo1 signalling contributes gluconeogenesis modulating the
expression gluconeogenic transcription factors. particular, metabolic
profiling demonstrated clear shift towards gluconeogenesis metabolism, and
hdac9-foxo1 signalling strongly induced upregulate gluconeogenic
transcription factors following hcv infection. positive correlation between
hdac9 gluconeogenic transcription factor expression levels livers of
both hcv-infected patients normal individuals emphasizes clinical
relevance results. thus, hdac9-foxo1 signalling axis involved in
regulating gluconeogenic transcription factors, gluconeogenesis, hcv-induced 
type 2 diabetes.
