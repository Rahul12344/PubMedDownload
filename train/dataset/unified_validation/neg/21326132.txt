background: emergence viral resistance major obstacle antiretroviral 
treatment (art) effectiveness. human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1)
variants drug-resistance mutations identified naive and
antiretroviral drug-experienced children virologic failure, honduras 
el salvador.
methods: dried blood spots (dbs) 80 individuals (54 honduras, 26 from
el salvador) infected childhood 1989 2009 collected
in 2009. hiv pol region amplified sequenced identify
antiretroviral-resistant mutations according 2009 international aids
society. genotypic drug resistance interpretation performed using the
stanford algorithm. hiv-1 variants characterized phylogenetic analysis
and subtyping tools.
results: hiv-1 protease reverse transcription sequences obtained from
dbs specimens 71 66 patients, respectively, 80 patients. all
children native central americans carrying subtype b, mean age 9
years, male (65%), perinatally infected (96%), moderate/severe
aids symptoms (70%), receiving first line art time sequencing
(65%). diagnostic delay frequently observed. infected children honduras 
presented longer art experience clinical outcomes, frequent severe
symptoms. resistant variants infected 1 11 naive children el salvador but
none perinatally infected naive children honduras. resistance was
higher among art-exposed individuals countries similar protease
inhibitors (16%), nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors (44%-52%), and
nonnucleoside reverse-transcription inhibitors (66.7%). one 10 pretreated
children country infected resistant viruses 3 drug
families.
conclusions: data support need continued surveillance resistance
patterns using dbs national levels among naive pretreated children to
optimize art regimens.
