two adsorption-elution concentration methods, involving negatively charged
membranes, evaluated order monitor hepatitis virus (hav)
contamination tap, river, mineral coastal water samples: elution with
urea-arginine phosphate buffer/reconcentration magnesium chloride (method
1); sodium hydroxide elution/reconcentration commercial concentrator
(method 2). nested (qualitative) reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) real-time
(quantitative) rt-pcr used detect quantify hav rna concentrated
water samples. concentrating hav, method 1 found suitable 
for tap water method 2 suitable mineral water. hav inoculated
experimentally detected river water samples methods coastal
water samples neither method. detection limits 6 x 10(9) g equiv./ml 
for qualitative pcr 60 g equiv./ml quantitative pcr. field
application study, hav detected 20% river tap water samples not
in coastal mineral water samples. river water samples contained subgenotype
ia, tap water samples contained subgenotype ib. concluded that,
although influencing qualitative pcr, concentration method affect
quantitative pcr, could therefore used types water samples.
both techniques recommended detecting hav environmental water samples.
