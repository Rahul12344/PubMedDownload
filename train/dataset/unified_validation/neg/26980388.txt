background: recurrence rate sinonasal inverted papillomas (snip) is
15-20%. however, studies investigated patient-dependent factors related 
to recurrence snips.
objective: analyze risk factors, including human papilloma virus (hpv)
infection smoking, well factors, recurrence snips.
methods: fifty-four patients diagnosed snip underwent surgery
were enrolled: 39 men 15 women, mean age 54.0 years. mean
follow-up 40.6 months. demographics information history of
smoking, previous surgery, tumor extent, follow-up, recurrence reviewed 
retrospectively. patients whose tumors associated malignant
transformation excluded study. hpv detection genotyping the
tumor specimens performed hpv dna chip, polymerase chain
reaction-based dna microarray system.
results: seven patients (13.0%) recurrence, mean time recurrence of
39.8 months. recurrence rates t1, t2, t3, t4 krouse staging system 
were 0% (0/4), 8.3% (2/24), 17.4% (4/23), 33.3% (1/3), respectively (p >
0.5). eight patients (14.8%) positive hpv dna. patients
belonged group without recurrence (p > 0.5). however, recurrence rates
according hpv dna positivity statistically different (0% versus
15.2%). three (42.9%) group recurrence four (8.5%) group
without recurrence smokers (p < 0.5).
conclusion: smoking associated recurrence snip. however, hpv
infection recurrence snip risk factor.
