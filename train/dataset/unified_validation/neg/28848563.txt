using shrna high-throughput screening, identified h-ras regulator of
antiviral activity, whose depletion could enhance sindbis virus replication.
further analyses indicated depletion h-ras results robust increase
in vesicular stomatitis virus infection decrease sendai virus
(sev)-induced retinoic acid-inducible gene-i-like receptor (rlr) signaling.
interestingly, however, ectopic expression wild-type h-ras results a
biphasic mode rlr signaling regulation: low-level expression h-ras
enhances sev-induced rlr signaling, high-level expression h-ras significantly 
inhibits signaling. inhibitory effects correlate activation
status h-ras. result, oncogenic h-ras, h-rasv12, strongly inhibits
sev-induced ifn-Î² promoter activity type interferon signaling. conversely, 
the positive effects exerted h-ras rlr signaling independent its
signaling activity, constitutively inactive form h-ras, h-rasn17, also
positively regulates rlr signaling. mechanistically, demonstrate that
depletion h-ras reduces formation mavs-tnf receptor-associated factor 3
signaling complexes. results reveal h-ras protein plays role 
promoting mavs signalosome assembly mitochondria, whereas oncogenic h-ras 
exerts negative effect type ifn responses.
