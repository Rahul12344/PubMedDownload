background: genotyping hbv generally used determining the
epidemiological relationship various virus strains origin of
infection mostly research studies. utility genotyping clinical
applications beginning gain importance. whether hbv genotyping will
constitute part clinical evaluation hepatitis b patients depends
largely availability relevance evidence based information.
since pakistan hbv genotype distribution considered less
virulent investigated earlier studies south east asian countries, a
study correlation hbv genotypes risk progression further
complex hepatic infection much needed
methods: total 295 patients hbsag positive selected the
pakistan medical research council's (pmrc) patient clinics. two hundred and
twenty six (77%) males, sixty nine (23%) females (m f ratio 3.3:1).
results: 295 patients, 156 (53.2%) acute(cah), 71 (24.2%) hbv
carriers, 54 (18.4%) chronic liver disease (cld) hepatitis. 14 (4.7%) were
cirrhosis hcc patients. genotype prevalent genotype all
categories hbv patients, acute (108), chronic (39), carrier
(53).cirrhosis/hcc (7) hbv/d positive. genotype second most
prevalent 28 (13%) acute cases, 12 (22.2%) chronics, 14 (19.7%) in
carriers 5 (41.7) cirrhosis/hcc patients. mixed genotype (a/d) found
in 20 (12.8%) acute patients, 3 (5.6%) chronic 4 (5.6%) carriers,
none case severe liver conditions.
conclusion: mixed hbv genotypes a, a/d combination present all
categories patients except a/d combination detected severe
conditions. genotype dominant genotype. however, genotype found
to strongly associated severe liver disease. mixed genotype (a/d)
did significantly appear influence clinical outcome.
