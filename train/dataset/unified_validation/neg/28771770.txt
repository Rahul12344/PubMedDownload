cutaneous human papillomavirus (hpv) types 1, 2, 4, 7 57 reportedly found
in cutaneous warts. however, reports investigated the
prevalence mucosal hpv types cutaneous warts. aim study to
investigate prevalence mucosal hpv types patients cutaneous warts 
and determine association hpv types patient characteristics.
we analyzed 62 wart samples taken patients diagnosed with
cutaneous warts, 30 normal skin samples used negative control. we
recorded following characteristics: sex, age, type warts, duration of
warts, number warts patient's immune status. matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry (ms)-based
restriction fragment mass polymorphism (rfmp) assay used hpv genotyping. 
of total 62 wart samples, 50 samples (81.6%) positive hpv genotypes.
all negative controls (30 samples) using normal skin showed negative
reaction. mucosal hpv types (49 samples, 84.4%) highly detected, high-
or probable high-risk hpv types (39 samples, 67.2%) common lower
risk hpv types (10 samples, 17.2%). statistically significant association was
observed sex, age, duration warts risk hpv types. the
best knowledge, first study use rfmp assay analyze
cutaneous wart-associated mucosal hpv types. high prevalence high-risk and
probable high-risk hpv study great significance.
