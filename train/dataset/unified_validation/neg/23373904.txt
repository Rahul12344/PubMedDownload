adenovirus-based drugs efficient combined anticancer
treatments. show treatment ly294002 ly303511 upregulates
expression recombinant proteins encoded replication-defective adenoviruses,
including expression therapeutically valuable combination herpes simplex
virus thymidine kinase controlled human telomerase reverse transcriptase
promoter (ad-htert-hsvtk). line this, treatment ly294002 synergized 
with ad-htert-hsvtk infection presence gancyclovir prodrug calu-i
lung cancer cell death. effect ly294002 ly303511 on
adenovirus-delivered transgene expression demonstrated 4 human lung cancer
cell lines. ly294002-induced upregulation adenovirally delivered transgene 
mediated part direct inhibition mtor protein kinase mtorc2 signaling 
complex thus suggesting anticancer drugs targeting mtor also enhance
expression transgenes delivered adenoviral vectors. ly294002 
ly303511 candidate prototypic anticancer drugs, many mtor inhibitors 
cancer treatment development, results important implication
for development future therapeutic strategies adenoviral gene delivery.
