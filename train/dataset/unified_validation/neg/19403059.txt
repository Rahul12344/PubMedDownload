many viral epitope specific cell receptors (tcrs) mhc-matched individuals
have demonstrated involve conserved amino acid motifs beta chain
complementarity-determining region 3 (cdr3). however, sure whether 
conserved motifs also found tcr beta chain. previous studies, we
developed modified method enlarge percentage cytomegalovirus (cmv)
pp65 peptide-specific cd8(+) cells pbmc continuous peptide stimulation in
vitro, provides sufficient number specific cells detection. in
this study, analyzed restrictive usage tcr v alpha v beta
gene families investigated cdr3 gene sequence pp65 peptide-specific
cd8(+) cells. analysis cdr3 spectratypes suggested restricted usage tcr
alpha chain av8, av12, av21, av31 families tcr beta chain bv3, bv14, bv21,
bv23, bv11 families donor cd8(+) cells stimulated pp65 peptide. the
sequences cells involved similar sequence (tx) g (x) cdr3 region 
of tcr alpha chain l (xt) g (x) tcr beta chain.
