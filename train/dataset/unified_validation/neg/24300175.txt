whiteflies, hemiptera: aleyrodidae, bemisia tabaci, complex morphologically 
indistinquishable species(5), vectors many plant viruses. several genera
of whitefly-transmitted plant viruses (begomovirus, carlavirus, crinivirus,
ipomovirus, torradovirus) include several hundred species emerging and
economically significant pathogens important food fiber crops (reviewed
by(9,10,16)). viruses replicate vector nevertheless are
moved readily plant plant adult whitefly various means
(reviewed by(2,6,7,9,10,11,17)). viruses whitefly feeding is
required acquisition inoculation, others probing is
required. many viruses unable cannot easily transmitted by
other means. therefore maintenance virus cultures, biological molecular
characterization (identification host range symptoms)(3,13),
ecology(2,12), require viruses transmitted experimental hosts
using whitefly vector. addition development new approaches to
management, evaluation new chemicals(14) compounds(15), new
cultural approaches(1,4,19), selection development resistant
cultivars(7,8,18), requires use whiteflies virus transmission. use
of whitefly transmission plant viruses selection development of
resistant cultivars breeding programs particularly challenging(7).
effective selection screening resistance employs large numbers plants 
and need 100% plants inoculated order find 
few genotypes possess resistance genes. studies use large
numbers viruliferous whiteflies, often several times per year. whitefly
maintenance described generate hundreds thousands adult whiteflies
on plants week, year round, without contamination plant
viruses. plants free whiteflies virus must produced introduce
into whitefly colony week. whitefly cultures must kept free of
whitefly pathogens, parasites, parasitoids reduce whitefly
populations and/or reduce transmission efficiency virus. colonies
produced manner described quickly scaled increase decrease
population numbers needed, adjusted accommodate feeding
preferences whitefly based plant host virus. two
basic types whitefly colonies maintained: nonviruliferous 
viruliferous whitefly colony. nonviruliferous colony composed of
whiteflies reared virus-free plants allows weekly availability of
whiteflies used transmit viruses different cultures. the
viruliferous whitefly colony, composed whiteflies reared virus-infected
plants, allows weekly availability whiteflies acquired virus
thus omitting one step virus transmission process.
