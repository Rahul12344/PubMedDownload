genital herpes simplex virus (hsv) sexually transmitted disease (std) 
affects millions people worldwide mainly due hsv type 2.
seroprevalence rates high 60-90% reported developing
countries. developed countries, 20% general population hsv2
seropositive. recent epidemiological surveys employing type-specific antibody
assays show prevalence hsv-2 infections rising alarming
rate. also, epidemiology changing increasing incidence first
episodes caused hsv-1. natural history hsv infection includes acute 
subclinical first episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment neuronal
latency, intermittent virus reactivation without associated symptoms.
although sequence events recognized five decades, 
little known exact mechanism latency reactivation. almost all
persons hsv2 infection recurrences. recent data show many 
these infections subclinical: subclinical shedding documented 
80% hsv2 seropositive individuals deny subclinical lesions. suggests 
that patients shed virus transmit even absence clinical signs
and genital herpes redefined chronic rather an
intermittent disease.
