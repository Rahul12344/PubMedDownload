background: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf) approved children but
concerns remain long-term renal bone toxicity. evaluated the
efficacy, safety pharmacokinetics tdf treatment-experienced children
during 96 weeks.
methods: prospective, open-label study hiv-infected children 3-18
years age (≥15 kg), viral suppression first-line regimen without
tenofovir. children given tdf/lamivudine/efavirenz daily entry; tdf 
was prescribed according weight bands. age-, gender- cd4-matched controls 
receiving tdf-sparing regimens concomitantly enrolled. tenofovir
pharmacokinetic assessment performed week 4. cd4 counts, hiv-1 rna viral
load safety assessments determined baseline, 24, 48 96 weeks.
results: eighty children enrolled (40 per group); 35 (44%) male. median
age 12.2 (range 3.1-17.7) years. median administered dose 214 mg/m.
tenofovir geometric mean auc0-24 hours, cmax c24 hours 2.66 [90%
confidence interval (ci) 2.49-2.84] μg hours/ml, 0.26 (0.24-0.29) μg/ml 0.057
(0.052-0.062) μg/ml, respectively. estimated glomerular filtration rate not
significantly change overtime. fractional excretion calcium slightly
increased fractional excretion phosphate unchanged among children in
tdf group. bone mineral density z score decreased first 24 weeks of
tdf treatment stable afterward. tdf group lower cholesterol
levels (p = 0.001). thirty-nine 40 children remained virologically suppressed.
no serious adverse event related tenofovir.
conclusion: tdf substitution children adolescents otherwise
stable receiving first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor-based regimen achieved adequate exposure without clinically significant
renal bone adverse events 96 weeks. reassuring, preliminary
safety findings may exclude delayed effects renal function bone
density.
