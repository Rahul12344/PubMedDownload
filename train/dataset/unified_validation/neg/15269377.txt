nk cells participate innate immune responses secreting gamma interferon
(ifn-gamma) destroying virus-infected cells. interaction 
influenza sendai virus-infected macrophages nk cells studied. a
rapid, cell-cell contact-dependent production ifn-gamma nk cells cultured
with virus-infected macrophages observed. expression mhc class
i-related chain b (micb) gene, ligand nk cell-activating receptor nkg2d,
was upregulated virus-infected macrophages suggesting role micb the
activation ifn-gamma gene nk cells. il12rbeta2, il18r t-bet mrna
synthesis enhanced nk cells cultured virus-infected macrophages.
upregulation genes dependent macrophage-derived ifn-alpha. in
contrast il12rbeta2, expression wsx-1/tccr, receptor il27, was
reduced nk cells response virus-induced ifn-alpha. conclusion, 
results show virus-infected macrophages activate nk cells via cytokines 
direct cellular interactions emphasize role ifn-alpha the
activation innate immunity.
