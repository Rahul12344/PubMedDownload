the functional consequences overexpression rat heart na+/ca2+ exchanger
(ncx1) investigated adult rat myocytes primary culture. when
maintained continued electrical field stimulation conditions, cultured
adult rat myocytes retained normal contractile function compared freshly
isolated myocytes least 48 h. infection myocytes adenovirus
expressing green fluorescent protein (gfp) resulted >95% infection as
ascertained gfp fluorescence, contraction amplitude 6-, 24-, 48-h
postinfection affected. examined 48 h infection,
myocytes infected adenovirus expressing gfp ncx1 similar cell
sizes exhibited significantly altered contraction amplitudes and
intracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) transients, lower resting and
diastolic [ca2+]i compared myocytes infected adenovirus
expressing gfp alone. effects ncx1 overexpression sarcoplasmic
reticulum (sr) ca2+ content depended extracellular ca2+ concentration
([ca2+]o), decrease low [ca2+]o increase high [ca2+]o. the
half-times [ca2+]i transient decline similar, suggesting little no
changes sr ca2+-atpase activity. western blots demonstrated significant (p <
or = 0.02) threefold increase ncx1 changes sr ca2+-atpase and
calsequestrin abundance myocytes 48 h infection adenovirus expressing
both gfp ncx1 compared infected adenovirus expressing gfp
alone. conclude overexpression ncx1 adult rat myocytes incubated at
high [ca2+]o resulted enhanced ca2+ influx via reverse ncx1 function, as
evidenced greater sr ca2+ content, larger twitch, [ca2+]i transient
amplitudes. forward ncx1 function also increased, indicated lower
resting diastolic [ca2+]i.
