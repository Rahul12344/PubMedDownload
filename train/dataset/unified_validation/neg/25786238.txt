a successful hiv vaccine addition induction antibody responses should
elicit effective cell responses. described possible strategies for
rational design t-cell vaccine capable induce high levels cd4+ 
cd8+ t- cell responses. developed artificial hiv-1 polyepitope t-cell
immunogens based conserved natural cd8+ cd4+ cell epitopes from
different hiv-1 strains restricted frequent major human leukocyte
antigen (hla) alleles. designed immunogens contain optimized core polyepitope
sequence additional "signal" sequences increase epitope processing 
presentation cd8+ cd4+ t-lymphocytes: n-terminal ubiquitin, n-terminal
signal peptide c-terminal tyrosine motif lamp-1 protein. result we
engineered three cell immunogens - tci-n, tci-n2, tci-n3, different
combinations signal sequences. designed immunogens able elicit
hiv-specific cd4+ cd8+ cell responses following immunization. attachment of
either ubiquitin er-signal/lamp-1 sequences increased cd4+ cd8+
mediated hiv-specific cell responses comparison polyepitope immunogen
without additional signal sequences. moreover, tci-n3 polyepitope immunogen
with ubiquitin generated highest magnitude hiv-specific cd4+ cd8+ cell
responses study. obtained data suggests attachment signal
sequences targeting polyepitope immunogens either mhc class mhc class ii 
presentation pathways may improve immunogenicity t-cell vaccines. these
results support strategy rational cell immunogen design and
contribute development effective hiv-1 vaccine.
