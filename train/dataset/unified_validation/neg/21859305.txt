diarrhea caused rotavirus, cholera enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. the
efficacy adoption oral rehydration therapy would enhanced drug
that reduces fluid loss associated diseases alleviates disease
symptoms. secretion absorption intestine offer number potential
drug targets reduce fluid loss. among these, cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel attractive it
is primary driver secretion cases diarrhea caused enterotoxigenic
bacteria. cftr inhibited natural products synthetic small
molecules. iowh032 synthetic cftr inhibitor recently entered
clinical trials indication.
