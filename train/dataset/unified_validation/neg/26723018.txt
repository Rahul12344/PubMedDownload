background: limited data primary human immunodeficiency virus drug
resistance (hivdr) pediatric populations. study aimed assess the
prevalence primary hivdr associated risk factors among children initiating
first-line antiretroviral therapy (art) uganda.
methods: three ugandan clinics, children (age <12 years) requiring art were
recruited january 2010 august 2011. starting art, blood was
collected viral load pol gene sequencing. drug resistance mutations 
determined using 2010 international aids society-usa mutation list. risk
factors hivdr assessed multivariate regression analysis.
results: three hundred nineteen hiv-infected children median age 4.9
years enrolled. sequencing successful 279 children (87.5%). hivdr was
present 10% children 15.2% children <3 years. nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis), non-nrti (nnrti), dual-class resistance was
present 5.7%, 7.5%, 3.2%, respectively. hivdr occurred 35.7% of
prevention mother-to-child transmission (pmtct)-exposed children, 15.6% in
children unknown pmtct history, 7.7% among antiretroviral-naive
children. history pmtct exposure [adjusted odds ratio (aor): 2.6, 95% ci:
1.3-5.1] unknown pmtct status (aor: 3.8, 95% ci: 1.1-13.5), low cd4 (aor: 2.2,
95% ci: 1.3-3.6), current breastfeeding (aor: 7.4, 95% ci: 2.6-21), current
maternal art use (aor: 6.4, 95% ci: 3.4-11.9) emerged risk factors primary
hivdr multivariate analysis.
conclusion: pretreatment hivdr high, especially children pmtct
exposure. protease inhibitor (pi)-based regimens advocated world
health organization, availability children limited. children with
(unknown) pmtct exposure, low cd4 count, current breastfeeding, maternal art
need prioritized receive pi-based regimens.
