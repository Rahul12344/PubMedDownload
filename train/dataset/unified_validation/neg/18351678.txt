recent observations indicate bacterial inclusion bodies formed absence of
the main chaperone dnak result largely enriched functional, properly folded
recombinant proteins. unfortunately, molecular basis intriguing fact,
with obvious biotechnological interest, remains unsolved. explored here
two non-excluding physiological mechanisms could account this
observation, namely selective removal inactive polypeptides inclusion
bodies situ functional activation embedded proteins. combining
structural functional analysis, observed preferential
selection inactive misfolded protein species dissagregating
machinery inclusion body disintegration. instead, data strongly
support folding intermediates aggregated inclusion bodies could complete 
their natural folding process deposited protein clusters, conduces 
to significant functional activation. addition, situ folding protein
activation inclusion bodies negatively regulated chaperone dnak.
