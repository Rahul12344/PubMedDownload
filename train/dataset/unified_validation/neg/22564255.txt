the treatment choice profound sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) direct 
electrical stimulation spiral ganglion cells (sgc) via cochlear implant
(ci). number excitability sgc seem critical success that
can achieved via ci treatment. however, snhl associated degeneration
of sgc. long-term drug delivery inner ear improving sgc survival may
be achieved functionalisation ci electrodes cells providing growth
factors. therefore, capacity brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(bdnf)-secreting nih3t3 cells grown cylindrically shaped silicone elastomers
(se) exert local sustained neuroprotective effects assessed vitro
and vivo. vitro model investigate adhesion cell growth of
lentivirally modified nih3t3 cells synthesising bdnf se established. the
bioactivity bdnf characterised co-cultivation sgc cell-coated
se. addition, cell-coated se implanted deafened guinea pigs. the
recombinant nih3t3 cells proliferated silicone surfaces 14 days of
cultivation expressed significantly increasing bdnf levels. enhanced survival
rates neurite outgrowth sgc demonstrated bioactivity bdnf vitro.
implantation se adhering bdnf-secreting nih3t3 cells cochleae of
systemically deafened guinea pigs induced significant increase sgc survival 
in comparison se without cell coating. data demonstrate novel approach
of cell-based long-term drug delivery support sgc survival vitro in
vivo. therapeutic strategy--once transferred cells suitable clinical 
application--may improve ci performance.
