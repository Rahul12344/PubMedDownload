a stable, non-peptide inhibitor protease type 1 human
immunodeficiency virus developed, stereochemistry binding
defined crystallographic three-dimensional structure determination. the
initial compound, haloperidol, discovered computational screening 
the cambridge structural database using shape complementarity algorithm. the
subsequent modification non-peptidic lateral lead, belongs family
of compounds well characterized pharmacological properties. thioketal
derivative haloperidol halide counterion bound within enzyme
active site mode distinct observed peptide-based inhibitors. 
variant protease cocrystallized inhibitor shows binding the
manner predicted initial computer-based search. structures provide
the context subsequent synthetic modifications inhibitor.
