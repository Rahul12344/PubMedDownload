in paper, report structural characterization several spinach
ferredoxin-nadp+ oxidoreductase (fnr) cdnas ranging size 0.9 1.5
kilobases. comparison deduced amino acid sequence known amino
acid sequence determined spinach protein establishes 1.4-1.5 kpb
inserts span full length mature protein (314 amino acid residues; mr =
35,382). also include n-terminal 55 amino acid transit peptide well
as maximally 171 214 nucleotide 5' 3' untranslated sequences,
respectively. evidence obtained various forms fnr arise 
least two similar genes. fnr precursor (369 amino acid residues) a
calculated molecular mass 41.2 kda. comparison transit peptide with
transit peptides two stromal proteins shows little similarity the
level primary sequence common features secondary structure
predictions.
