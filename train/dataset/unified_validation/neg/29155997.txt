response immune checkpoint therapy associated high mutation
burden, mechanisms also likely important. identified a
patient metastatic gastric cancer meaningful clinical benefit from
treatment anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) antibody avelumab. this
tumor showed evidence high mutation burden mismatch repair defect but
was strongly positive presence epstein-barr virus (ebv) encoded rna.
analysis cancer genome atlas gastric cancer data (25 ebv+, 80
microsatellite-instable [msi], 310 microsatellite-stable [mss]) showed that
ebv-positive tumors mss. two-sided wilcoxon rank-sum tests showed that: 1)
ebv-positive tumors low mutation burden (median = 2.07 vs 3.13 log10
scale, p < 10-12) stronger evidence immune infiltration (median
immunescore 2212 vs 1295, p < 10-4; log2 fold-change cd8a = 1.85, p < 10-6)
compared msi tumors, 2) ebv-positive tumors higher expression of
immune checkpoint pathway (pd-1, ctla-4 pathway) genes rna-seq data (log2
fold-changes: pd-1 = 1.85, pd-l1 = 1.93, pd-l2 = 1.50, ctla-4 = 1.31, cd80 =
0.89, cd86 = 1.31, p < 10-4 each), higher lymphocytic infiltration by
histology (median tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte score = 3 vs 2, p < .001)
compared mss tumors. data suggest ebv-positive low-mutation
burden gastric cancers subset mss gastric cancers may respond to
immune checkpoint therapy.
