human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) spreads primarily cell-to-cell
transmission. therefore, htlv-1 promotes proliferation infected cells to
facilitate transmission. htlv-1 infected individuals, provirus present 
mainly effector/memory cells foxp3+ cells. recent study suggests 
this immunophenotype acquired infected cells function htlv-1
bzip factor (hbz). tax, encoded plus strand, crucial viral
replication de novo infection, hbz, encoded minus strand, is
important proliferation infected cells. importantly, hbz tax have
opposing functions transcription pathways. hbz tax cooperate in
elaborate ways permit viral replication, proliferation infected cells and
propagation virus.
