infections estimated cause approximately 15% world's cancers with
large geographic variations. yet, canadian estimates specific cancer-causing 
infections available. estimate number infection-associated
cancers diagnosed among canadian adults 2015, calculated population
attributable risks (pars) number attributable cases seven
carcinogenic infections 20 associated cancers. systematic literature 
search performed infection obtain data infection prevalence in
the population relative risk odds ratio associated cancer 
causes. mechanistic evidence suggested detection given infection
within cancer tissue sufficient attribute cancer infection,
prevalence among cancer cases used approximate par. data 61
studies formed basis analyses. estimated number of
infection-attributable cancer cases 2015 was: 3828 human papillomavirus
(hpv), 2052 helicobacter pylori, 578 epstein-barr virus, 509 for
hepatitis b c viruses (hbv, hcv), 100 human herpesvirus type 8, 30
cases human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. seven infections were
responsible 3.7% cancers diagnosed among canadian adults 2015; 3.5%
among men 4.0% among women. infections highest number of
attributable cases largely preventable treatable vaccination (hbv 
and hpv), antibiotic therapy (h. pylori), combination interventions
(hcv), thereby representing important target reducing infection-caused
cancer burden among canadians.
