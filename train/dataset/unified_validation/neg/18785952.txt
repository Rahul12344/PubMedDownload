background: hepatitis e major health problem developing countries
including india. incidence mortality rate pregnant women with
fulminant hepatic failure (fhf) due hepatitis e virus (hev) reported 
to significantly higher, specifically asian women. pregnancy usually
associated altered status sex steroid hormones immunity. steroid
hormones directly influence replication effects viral
regulatory elements. moreover, pregnant women asia generally suffer from
folate deficiency, known cause reduced immunocompetence leading to
greater risk multiple viral infections higher viral load.
objectives: correlate analyze viral load genotypes hev acute
liver failure acute viral hepatitis among pregnant nonpregnant
women.
materials methods: total 100 fhf 150 acute viral hepatitis (avh)
patients (50, 75 pregnant 50, 75 nonpregnant, respectively), included in
the study. cases evaluated basis history, clinical
examination, liver function profile, serological test hepatitis a, b, c,
and e using commercially available elisa kits. quantification hev rna-positive
samples carried out.
results: 100 fhf 150 acute viral hepatitis (avh) patients, 28 (56%)
and 22 (29.3%) pregnant 7 (14%) 8 (16%) nonpregnant, respectively, were
hev rna-positive. hev viral load fhf pregnant women 5.87 x 10(4)+/- 1.5 x 
10(5) microl/ml compared avh pregnant women 343.29 +/- 216.44 microl/ml and
fhf avh nonpregnant 199.2 +/- 225.5 microl/ml 13.83 +/- 7.8 microl/ml,
respectively. sequencing data positive samples fhf avh pregnant
and nonpregnant women showed genotype 1.
conclusion: hev viral load found significantly higher (p < 0.05) in
pregnant patients compared nonpregnant. pregnancy appears risk
factor viral replication. viral copies hev fhf pregnant women 
comparatively higher compared avh pregnant women, may related to
the severity disease patients. could detect one genotype 
(genotype 1) study population. thus absence genotypes in
this population, impact genotype could adequately assessed 
study.
