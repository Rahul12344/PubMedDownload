background: human herpesvirus-6 (hhv-6) infection ubiquitous selected
population seroprevalence 60-80%. little known china,
except sporadic studies. understand prevalence hhv-6 antibody in
chinese population, seroepidemiological study conducted.
methods: sera collected 430 healthy persons donors living north 
china, tested hhv-6 antibodies using ifa hhv-6 gs strain passaged on
hsb-2 cells antigen, titer equal higher 1:10 regarded as
seropositive.
results: 430 serum samples tested, 297 (69.1%) positive hhv-6
igg. seropositive rate gmt females significantly higher than
those males, x2 = 7.05, p < 0.01 f = 7.23, p < 0.01, respectively.
statistically significant difference prevalence hhv-6 antibody among
various age groups observed sexes, x2 = 20.08 20.28, p =
0.04, respectively, young children higher titer adults. but, no
significant difference prevalence observed blood donors various
age groups sexes.
conclusions: study suggests hhv-6 infection seropositive igg is
ubiquitous north china, importance studied.
