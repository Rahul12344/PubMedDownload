human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) splicing strictly
controlled ensure balanced production unspliced differently
spliced viral rnas. splicing major 59 splice site (59ss) used 
the synthesis spliced rnas modulated local rna structure and
binding regulatory sr proteins. here, demonstrate suboptimal
sequence complementarity 59ss u1 small nuclear rna (snrna) also 
contributes prevent excessive splicing. analysis large set hiv-1
sequences revealed three regulatory features 59ss region (rna
structure, sr protein binding sequence complementarity u1 snrna) are
highly conserved amongst virus isolates, supports importance.
combined mutations destabilize local rna structure, remove binding sites
for inhibitory sr proteins optimize u1 snrna complementarity resulted 
almost complete splicing accordingly reduced virus replication.
