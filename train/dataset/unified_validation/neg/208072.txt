of mammalian retroviruses.

the major structural polypeptides, p30 reticuloendotheliosis virus (rev)
(strain t) p27 avian sarcoma virus b77, compared regard 
amino acid composition. nh2-terminal amino acid sequence, immunological
crossreactions. amino acid composition two polypeptides distinct,
and comparison first 30 nh2-terminal amino acids rev p30 that
for first 25 b77 p27 yields three homologous residues. competition
radioimmunoassays polypeptides show crossreactivity. comparison the
amino acid composition nh2-terminal amino acid sequence rev p30 those
reported several mammalian retrovirus p30s shows remarkable similarities.
both rev mammalian p30s contain large number polar residues their
amino acid composition show approximately 40% homology first 30
nh2-terminal amino acids. crossreactivity could observed, however, in
competition radioimmunoassays rauscher murine leukemia virus p30 that
of rev. observations reported suggest close evolutionary relationship 
between rev mammalian retroviruses.
