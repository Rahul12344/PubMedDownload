from june 1992 may 1993, rotaviruses detected immunoenzymatic assay
in 159 (49.5%) 321 children admitted hospital acute diarrhea. of
the 159 cases elisa positive, 80 samples chosen random investigate
subgroups serotypes group human rotavirus. elisa test 9 (11.3%)
of strains subgroup i, 46 (57.5%) subgroup ii, 25 (31.3%) could
not grouped. serotype g1 identified 52 cases (65%), g2 11 cases 
(13.8%), g3 1 case (1.2%), 7 cases (8.8%) showed one serotype.
by electrophoretic analysis viral rna, 137 (42.7%) samples exhibited an
rna pattern. long pattern (59.1%) prevailed short pattern (35.8%),
and coelectrophoresis 8 different electropherotypes found throughout 
period study. results illustrate great variety rotavirus strains 
in region country.
