large icosahedral viruses infect bacteria represent extreme the
coevolution capsids genomes accommodate. one subset these
large viruses jumbophages, tailed phages double-stranded dna genomes 
of least 200,000 bp. explored mechanism leading increased capsid and
genome sizes characterizing structures several jumbophage capsids the
dna packaged within them. capsid structures determined six jumbophages were
consistent canonical phage hk97 fold, three capsid geometries
with novel triangulation numbers (t=25, t=28, t=52). packaged dna
(chromosome) sizes larger genome sizes, indicating all
jumbophages use head-full dna packaging mechanism. two phages (pau g), 
the sizes appeared much larger genome length. used
two-dimensional dna gel electrophoresis show two dnas migrated
abnormally due base modifications allow us calculate actual
chromosome sizes. results support ratchet model capsid genome
coevolution whereby mutations lead increased capsid volume allow the
acquisition additional genes. added genes larger capsid are
established, mutations restore smaller size disfavored.importance 
large family viruses share fold capsid protein as
bacteriophage hk97, virus infects bacteria. members family use
different numbers capsid protein build capsids different sizes.
here, examined structures extremely large capsids measured their
dna content relative sequenced genome lengths, aiming understand the
process increases size. concluded mutational changes leading to
larger capsids become locked subsequent changes genome organization.
