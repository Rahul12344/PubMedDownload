previous vitro studies shown hiv-1 virus alter the
cytokine/chemokine profile polarized macrophages may lead their
increased susceptibility viral infection. here, found m2 monocyte
derived macrophages (mdm) significantly permissive productive
infection r5-tropic hiv-1 strains, including transmitted founder (t/f)
viruses, m1 mdm. previous vitro studies lab showed regulatory
t cells (tregs) suppress hiv-1 infection non-treg cd4 cells. here, we
investigated potential inhibitory effects tregs hiv-1 infection of
polarized mdm. found tregs significantly increased hiv-1 infection m1 
and m2 mdm via mechanism cell contact dependent. findings
suggest potential role tregs hiv-1 infection tissue resident
macrophages m1 m2 phenotype, may contribute establishment and
pathogenesis hiv-1 disease.
