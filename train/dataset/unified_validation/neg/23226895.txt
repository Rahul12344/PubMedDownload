the modes transmission model widely used help decision-makers
target measures preventing human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. 
model estimates number new hiv infections acquired the
ensuing year individuals identified risk groups given population using
data size groups, aggregate risk behaviour group, the
current prevalence hiv infection among sexual injecting drug partners
of individuals group, probability hiv transmission associated 
with different risk behaviours. strength model simplicity,
which enables data variety sources synthesized, resulting in
better characterization hiv epidemics settings. however, concerns have
been raised assumptions underlying model structure, about
limitations data available deriving input parameters about
interpretation communication model results. aim review was
to improve use model reassessing paradigm, structure data
requirements. identified key questions asked conducting analysis
and interpreting model results make recommendations for
strengthening model's application future.
