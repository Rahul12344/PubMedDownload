transplasma membrane electron transport activity fetal rat liver cells
(rla209-15) infected temperature-sensitive strain sv40 been
measured cells grown restrictive temperature (40 degrees c) and
permissive temperature (33 degrees c). transformed cells grown 33 degrees 
c one-half rate external ferricyanide reduction the
nontransformed cells held 40 degrees c. km vmax ferricyanide 
reduction changed transformed state. change vmax based 
on decrease nadh transformed cells. change rate with
ferricyanide depend change surface charge. reduction external
ferricyanide accompanied release protons cells. ratio of
protons released ferricyanide reduced higher transformed cells than
in non-transformed cells. since transplasma membrane electron transport
has shown stimulate cell growth limiting serum, changes 
plasma membrane electron transport proton release transformed cells may
relate modification growth control.
