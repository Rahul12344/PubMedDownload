serum antibody (virus neutralisation, complement fixation, igm igg) responses
to equine herpesvirus-1 (ehv-1) infection measured six foals were
initially free ehv-1 ehv-4 infection maternally-derived antibodies. 
following primary infection, high titres virus neutralisation complement
fixation antibodies detectable ehv-1, however, corresponding
antibody levels ehv-4 low inapparent, although two viruses
share number cross-reactive epitopes. addition, following primary
infection ehv-1, igm levels increased igg, virus
neutralisation complement fixation antibodies, peaked sooner thereafter
declined. stimulation igm levels observed secondary infection with
ehv-1 given 61 days later. contrast, igg, virus neutralisation complement 
fixation antibodies following primary infection sustained no
increase levels observed secondary infection. consistent
changes igm igg levels seen administration dexamethasone to
reactivate latent virus.
