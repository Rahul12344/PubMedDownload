the prevalence genetic diversity human caliciviruses causing sporadic
cases acute gastroenteritis young children hospitalized large
pediatric hospital melbourne, australia 5 years (incorporating january
1998-december 2002) studied reverse transcription sequence analysis of
part polymerase gene. overall prevalence calicivirus infection in
children aged <5 years 5 year study 9.2% (113/1,233), 95% 
the strains belonging norovirus genera. strains norovirus g11-4
cluster common type identified 4 5 years studied (1998,
1999, 2001, 2002), strains norovirus cluster g11-5 common
type 2000. additional norovirus genetic clusters gi-3, gii-1, gii-2,
gii-3, gii-6, gii-7, also identified, comprised 17/94 of
norovirus genogroup ii strains. five sapovirus strains also identified.
these results highlight divergence norovirus strains identified a
pediatric population.
