retinoic acid-inducible gene-i (rig-i)-like receptors [rlrs; rig-i melanoma
differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda5)] sense virus-derived rna synthetic 
analog double-stranded rna polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(i:c)] are
responsible host defense viruses. however, remains unclear whether
radiation affects rlrs. therefore, present study investigated effects 
ionizing radiation rig-i mda5 expression response poly(i:c)
using thp1 (human monocytic cell line)-derived macrophages. non- x-irradiated
(1-10 gy) macrophages expressed rig-i mda5 mrna protein levels and
there significant difference expression levels. non- and
x-irradiated macrophages expressed antiviral cytokine interferon (ifn)-β mrna
following poly(i:c)-low molecular weight/lyovec™ poly(i:c)-high molecular
weight/lyovec™ stimulation, agonist rig-i mda5, respectively. line 
with results expression rig-i mda5, significant difference
in expression ifn-β mrna observed non- x-irradiation.
these results indicate ionizing radiation hardly affects rlr expression 
the response agonist poly(i:c) thp1-derived macrophages.
