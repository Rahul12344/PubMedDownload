a novel dna virus, tt virus (ttv), proposed possible etiologic
agent non a-e hepatitis. aim present study determine the
prevalence ttv infection using pcr healthy blood donors patients
with clotting disorders investigated previously gbv-c/hgv and
hcv infection belgium. study, pcr using primers proposed takahashi 
et al. [(1998) hepatology research 12:233-239] proved far sensitive than
those used okamoto et al. [(1998) journal medical virology 56:128-132]. the
sequence pcr products showed 87% identity published sequence. ttv
was present 29.7% healthy blood donors, figure intermediate the
low rate infection observed scotland high rates far east.
ttv detected 46.5% 127 patients studied clotting disorders as
compared 79.5% hcv 11.8% gbv-c/hgv infection. however, was
no impact level serum transaminases. treatment interferon hcv 
infection co-infected ttv suppressed temporarily serum ttv dna. therefore,
it concluded ttv dna detected frequently serum healthy blood
donors belgium often patients clotting disorders. ttv does
not cause liver disease contribute severity liver disease.
