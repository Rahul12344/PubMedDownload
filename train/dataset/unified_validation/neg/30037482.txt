in us, rabies lyssavirus (rabv) circulates wildlife species the
most significant reservoir public animal health perspective the
raccoon (procyon lotor). management wildlife rabies relies principally oral
rabies vaccination (orv) strategies using vaccine-laden bait delivery to
free-ranging target hosts, order reduce susceptible population to
prevent spread eliminate rabv circulation. objective to
evaluate efficacy ontario rabies vaccine bait (onrab) lethal
rabv challenge captive raccoons. sham live vaccine baits offered 50
raccoons efficacy evaluated 46, split two trials 17 29
raccoons. raccoons challenged lethal dose rabv 180 days
post-vaccination observed 90 days post-infection. raccoon bait
interactions assigned increasing integer scores approach, oral
manipulation, puncture, consumption behaviors. higher bait interaction scores
were observed fall compared spring trial, indicating more
raccoons consumed baits fall. although animal age explain
variation bait interaction scores, geometric mean rabies virus antibody
titers among juvenile vaccinates higher adults pre-challenge
time points. prevented fraction associated onrab delivery 0.73
(8/11, 95% ci 0.39-0.94) spring trial 0.91 (21/23, 95% ci 0.72-0.99)
in fall trial. sham-vaccinated raccoons (12/12) succumbed rabies
infection, contrast 15% (5/34) mortality among vaccinated raccoons. our
results indicate high efficacy onrab bait vaccination protecting adult
and juvenile raccoons rabv infection minimum six months. these
data complement experimental field trials also demonstrated the
potential onrab control prevention rabv circulation in
free-ranging raccoon populations us.
