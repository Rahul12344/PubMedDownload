this work describes, first time, fabrication poly(l-aspartic acid)
(paa) film modified pencil graphite electrode (pge) detection of
hepatitis c virus 1a (hcv1a). presence paa electrode surface can
provide free carboxyl groups covalent binding biomolecules. pge
surface first coated paa via electropolymerization l-aspartic
acid, avidin subsequently attached paa modified electrode by
covalent attachment. biotinylated hcv1a probes immobilized avidin/paa/pge
via avidin-biotin interaction. morphology paa/pge examined using a
scanning electron microscope. hybridization events monitored square
wave voltammetry using meldola's blue (mdb). compared non-complementary
oligonucleotide sequences, hybridization carried probe
and synthetic targets synthetic polymerase chain reaction analog of
hcv1a, highest mdb signal observed. linear range biosensor was
12.5 100 nm limit detection calculated 8.7 nm. biosensor
exhibited favorable stability relatively long-term storage. these
results suggest paa-modified electrode used nucleic acid biosensor
application electropolymerization l-aspartic acid considered a
good candidate immobilization biomolecules.
