nucleotide requirements dna replication sv40 chromatin in
digitonin-treated saponin-treated permeable cells.

oda t, watanabe s, maki y, iwamoto h.

permeable cell systems developed treatment digitonin saponin
for studying vitro dna replication chromatin. dna replication sv40
nucleoprotein complexes (sv40 chromatin) systems requires addition
of atp, dctp, dgtp, dttp, mg2+. addition three other
ribonucleoside triphosphates slightly increased dna synthesis. omission atp
greatly reduced dna synthesis. presence atp, however, omission datp 
did significantly alter rather slightly enhanced dna synthesis. analysis
of replicated sv40 dna gel electrophoresis autoradiography indicated 
complete replication sv40 dna chromatin occurred systems
