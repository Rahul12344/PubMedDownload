the sequence viroid grapevine closely related severe isolates of
citrus exocortis viroid.

garcía-arenal f, pallás v, flores r.

the primary structure grapevine viroid (gvs) isolated spain was
determined. sequence consisted 369 nucleotide residues forming circular 
molecule. gvs presented extensive homology viroids potato spindle
tuber viroid (pstv) group, specially high case citrus
exocortis viroid (cev) variants found isolates inducing severe (92% 
with cev-a) mild (89% cev-de26) symptoms tomato. secondary
structure proposed gvs showed changes sequence relation to
cev-a generated modifications secondary structure particularly important
in left terminal (tl), variable (v) pathogenesis (p) viroid domains 
have postulated. nevertheless noted gvs central core p
domain conserved class sequence variants characteristic of
severe isolates, class b ones found mild isolates cev. these
observations indicate gvs considered severe isolate cev
from grapevine (cev-g), suggestion correlates biological
properties cev-g tomato gynura aurantiaca. presence this
central core p domain seems characterize variants cev
inducing severe symptoms tomato.
