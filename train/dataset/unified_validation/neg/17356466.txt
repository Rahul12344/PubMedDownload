objective: coinfection hepatitis c virus (hcv) reported associated 
with higher prevalence lipodystrophy hiv infection alone. examine
the association hcv adipose tissue volume hiv-infected men and
women.
methods: cross-sectional analysis hiv-infected subjects study fat 
redistribution metabolic change hiv infection. mri measured regional
adipose tissue volume. detectable hcv rna defined hcv infection.
results: twenty percent 792 men 26% 329 women hiv/hcv-coinfected. 
hiv/hcv-coinfected hiv-monoinfected women similar amounts subcutaneous
adipose tissue (sat) leg, lower trunk, upper trunk, arm similar
amounts visceral adipose tissue (vat). similar findings seen men,
except leg vat. adjustment, hcv infection remained associated
with leg fat men (12.2%, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.3 25.3; p =
0.043). among stavudine, hiv-monoinfected men less leg fat (-7%
effect per year stavudine use, 95% ci: -9 -5; p < 0.001); weaker
association seen hiv/hcv-coinfected men (-2% effect, 95% ci: -7 3; p = 
0.45). indinavir associated less leg fat (-4% hiv-monoinfected men,
95% ci: -6 -1; p = 0.002; -5% hiv/hcv-coinfected men, 95% ci: -11 2; p =
0.14).
conclusions: findings suggest hiv/hcv coinfection associated with
less sat men women. hcv infection seems mitigate loss leg fat
seen hiv-infected men stavudine.
