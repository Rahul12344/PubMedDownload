objective: investigate significance severe acute respiratory syndrome
associated coronavirus (sars-cov)-x4 protein expression lungs patients with
sars.
methods: pathological features lungs 4 sars patients examined
and expression sars-cov-x4 protein lungs evaluated with
immunohistochemical staining using specific antibodies protein x4.
results: microscopically, lungs 4 cases showed edema, erythrocyte and
fibrin exudates alveoli, hyperplasia alveolar epithelium, necrosis,
hyaline membrane formation fibroblast foci. immunohistochemical stains showed
a strong positivity x4 protein denudation cells, vascular endothelial cells
and also erythrocytes neutrophils alveoli lung tissues the
4 cases.
conclusions: expression sars-cov-x4 protein lungs may involved in
the pathogenesis progression sars.
