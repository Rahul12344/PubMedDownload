background: angiogenesis plays important role tumor growth metastasis, 
therefore antiangiogenic therapy widely investigated promising approach 
for cancer therapy. recently, pigment epithelium-derived factor (pedf) been
shown potent inhibitor angiogenesis. adeno-associated virus
(aav) vectors intensively studied due wide tropisms,
nonpathogenicity, long-term transgene expression vivo. objective of
this work evaluate ability aav-mediated human pedf (hpedf) a
potent tumor suppressor potential candidate cancer gene therapy.
methods: recombinant aav2 encoding hpedf (raav2-hpedf) constructed and
produced, assigned vitro vivo experiments. conditioned
medium cells infected raav2-hpedf used cell proliferation and
tube formation tests human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs).
subsequently, colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (crpc) mouse model was
established treated raav2-hpedf. therapeutic efficacy raav2-hpedf
were investigated, including tumor growth metastasis, survival time,
microvessel density (mvd) apoptosis index tumor tissues, hpedf levels 
in serum ascites.
results: raav2-hpedf successfully constructed, transmission electron
microscope (tem) showed raav2-hpedf particles non-enveloped icosahedral
shape diameter approximately 20 nm. raav2-hpedf-infected cells
expressed hpedf protein, conditioned medium infected cells inhibited
proliferation tube-formation huvecs vitro. furthermore, crpc mouse
model, raav2-hpedf significantly suppressed tumor growth metastasis, and
prolonged survival time treated mice. immunofluorescence studies indicated
that raav2-hpedf could inhibit angiogenesis induce apoptosis tumor
tissues. besides, hpedf levels serum ascites raav2-hpedf-treated mice
were significant higher raav2-null normal saline (ns) groups.
conclusions: thus, results suggest raav2-hpedf may potential
candidate antiangiogenic therapy agent.
