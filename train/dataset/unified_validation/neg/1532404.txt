silver-intensification methods described literature the
diaminobenzidine (dab) diaminobenzidine-nickel (dab/ni) endproduct the
peroxidase reaction compared model systems immunoperoxidase 
situ hybridization. first, methods compared immunohistochemical
model systems, using demonstration glial fibrillar acidic protein (gfap)
and prostate-specific antigen (psa) paraffin sections human brain and
prostate tissue, respectively. dab without ni used substrate, tissue 
argyrophilia caused considerable background staining. tissue
reactivity quenched with, e.g., cuso4 h2o2 thioglycolic acid, were
the results acceptable. considerable improvement signal-to-noise ratio
could obtained nickel included substrate mixture. methods 
that proved best demonstration gfap psa made use acid
developer solutions. subsequently, methods compared other
sensitive immunostaining methods demonstration gamma-delta t-cell
receptor frozen lymphoid tissue. model considerable increase 
number positive cells could obtained using silver intensification. the
different methods using dab/ni also compared use dna situ
hybridization (dish). case two model systems used: human papilloma
virus type 11 (hpv-11) dna condyloma tissue (abundant target model) and
epstein-barr virus (ebv) dna mononucleosis lymph node (low target model).
for demonstration hpv-11, methods gave less satisfactory results, 
which best acid developer solutions. moreover, demonstration of
ebv dna, signal could obtained developer solutions. a
method also proved suitable double immuno-hybrido stainings the
demonstration ebv dna specific antigen-positive reed-sternberg cells in
paraffin sections hodgkin lymph nodes.
