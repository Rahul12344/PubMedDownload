in new world health organization/european organization research and
treatment cancer (who/eortc) classification cutaneous lymphomas, large
b-cell lymphomas (lbcls) divided 3 groups: lbcl, leg-type (lbcllt);
follicle center lymphoma, diffuse type (fcldt); lbcl, others (lbclo). we
studied large number primary cutaneous lbcls test validity the
classification identify prognostic factors patients.
ninety-three cases primary cutaneous lbcl analyzed clinicopathologic 
features, expression several markers including bcl-2, bcl-6, mum-1, and
fox-p1, situ hybridization epstein-barr virus, molecular analyses of
igh gene rearrangement borrelia burgdorferi human herpesvirus 8 dna.
patients classified following categories: fcldt, 44 cases; lbcllt, 
40 cases; lbclo, 9 cases. statistical analyses showed lbcllt and
fcldt groups clearly distinct terms clinicopathologic features and
survival. lbclo group features lbcllt fcldt. 
study shows accurate morphologic phenotypic analyses allow us to
stratify patients prognostically different categories lbcllt and
fcldt. definition third category lbclo requires studies to
clarify whether cases indeed show distinct clinicopathologic features.
