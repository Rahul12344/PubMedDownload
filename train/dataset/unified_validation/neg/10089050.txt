gb virus c (gbv-c) related hepatitis c virus (hcv) similar
genomic structure. predictors efficacy interferon (ifn) therapy
on hcv reported: genotype, viral load, ifn dose, amino acid
substitutions ns5a region, designated interferon sensitivity
determining region (isdr). evaluate correlation amino acid
substitutions gbv-c ns5a region response ifn therapy,
single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis performed 12
concomitantly gbv-c-and hcv-infected patients received ifn therapy three
time points: before, end-point, ifn therapy. region the
gbv-c ns5a studied includes amino acids exhibit homology the
isdr various substitutions. sscp analysis, amplicons separated
into 1-4 bands, indicated existence heterogeneity host.
however, deduced amino acid sequences bands exhibited no
characteristic differences among strains irrespective response ifn
therapy. 32 strains separated sscp, 7 strains responders, 25
were nonresponders. mean amino acid substitution, compared consensus
sequence nonresponders, 1.00+/-0.93 among responders, 1.40+/-0.85
among non-responders (p= ns). correlation amino acid sequence in
the gbv-c ns5a region response ifn therapy found, indicating 
gbv-c ns5a region dose act isdr.
