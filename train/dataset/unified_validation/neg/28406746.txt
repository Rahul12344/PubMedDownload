background: influenza b virus two lineages; yamagata victoria. the
two lineages antigenically distinct difficult expect
cross-protection lineages. actually, mismatch circulating
influenza b viruses vaccine strains occurred frequently. the
cell-culture system production influenza vaccine contribute to
improve vaccine strain selection expand vaccine supplies. investigated the
immunogenicity safety cell culture-derived quadrivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine (nbp607-qiv) adults elderly subjects.
methods: randomized controlled phase iii trial undertaken 10 university 
hospitals republic korea (clinical trial number-nct02467842). adults
(aged 19-59 years) elderly subjects (aged ≥60 years) randomly assigned
in 2:1:1 ratio nbp607-qiv versus cell culture-based trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine-yamagata (nbp607-y) cell culture-based trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine-victoria (nbp607-v). immunogenicity assessed
3 weeks vaccination hemagglutination inhibition assay. safety was
assessed 6 months post-vaccination: solicited adverse events (aes) for
7 days, unsolicited aes 21 days serious adverse events (saes) for
6 months. aes sub-classified adverse drug reactions (adrs) according to
the causality.
results: total 1,503 participants randomly assigned nbp607-qiv (n = 
752), nbp607-y (n = 373) nbp607-v (n = 378). seroconversion rates of
nbp607-qiv 52.4%, 51.2%, 43.7% 55.8% a/h1n1, a/h3n2, b/yamagata 
and b/victoria, respectively. non-inferiority shared strains and
superiority alternate-lineage b strains demonstrated nbp607-qiv 
vs. nbp607-y nbp607-v. total 730 reactions occurred 324 (43.1%)
subjects nbp607-qiv group. majority adrs solicited (99.2%) mild
(90.3%) intensity. adults (aged 19-59 years), solicited local aes were
slightly frequent nbp607-qiv group nbp607-y nbp607-v group
(40.9%, 33.4% 32.5%, respectively). one sae observed among nbp607-qiv
group, considered unrelated study vaccine within 3 weeks
of vaccination vaccine-related saes reported 6 months after
vaccination.
conclusions: nbp607-qiv safe, well-tolerated immunogenic influenza
vaccine korean adults elderly subjects.
