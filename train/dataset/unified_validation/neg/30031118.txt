translational cancer research benefitted significantly generation of
preclinical models recapitulate native tumour environment. while
conventional cell models contributed substantially current
understanding cancer biology therapeutic development, missing link
between cell culture clinical applications evident. patient derived 
xenograft (pdx) models represent missing link enable examination
of patient tumour tissue native environment without significantly affecting 
the cellular complexity, genomics, stromal architecture neoplasms. the
use pdxs model head neck cancer (hnc) begets development novel
therapeutics, increased understanding tumorigenesis advent of
personalised treatments cancer patients. increase attempts
to generate viable pdxs hncs recent years. concise review summarizes 
the current developments field pdxs hncs.
