incorporation ligand-receptor binding-site models transistor-based sensors
for resolving dissociation constants number binding sites.

wang yl, huang cc, kang yw.

ligand-receptor binding site model used elucidate binding affinity
between ligands receptors, transistor-based sensors. algan/gan high
electron mobility transistors (hemts) immobilised antibodies human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase enzymes detect peptides
and human immunodeficiency virus drugs, respectively. signals generated by
the sensors binding ligands receptors fitted
into binding-site models analysed. dissociation constants the
ligand-receptor pairs number binding sites receptors were
revealed. results consistent data reported other
methods literatures. incorporation hemts binding-site
models demonstrated useful studying mechanism the
biomolecular interaction application quick cost-effective drug
developments.
