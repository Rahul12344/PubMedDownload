hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) one common cancers worldwide and
shows propensity metastasize infiltrate adjacent distant
tissues. hcc associated multiple risk factors, including hepatitis b
virus (hbv) infection, especially prevalent china. here, used
exome sequencing identify somatic mutations ten hbv-positive individuals
with hcc portal vein tumor thromboses (pvtts), intrahepatic metastases. both
c:g>a:t t:a>a:t transversions frequently found among 331 non-silent 
mutations. notably, arid1a, encodes component swi/snf chromatin
remodeling complex, mutated 14 110 (13%) hbv-associated hcc specimens. 
we used rna interference assess roles 91 confirmed mutated genes
in cellular survival. results suggest seven genes, including
vcam1 cdk14, may confer growth infiltration capacity hcc cells. this
study provides view landscape somatic mutations may be
implicated advanced hcc.
