the replication influenza viruses a/nws-d, a/ws-mk r12 recombinant
in human embryo fibroblast (hef) human diploid fibroblast (lep) cell lines
was studied. hef cells virus nws-d recombinant r12 induced synthesis of
virus-specific macromolecules produced infectious virions; virus ws-mk
induced synthesis virus complementary rna (crna), virion rna (vrna), protein, 
rnp non-infectious virions, haemagglutinin cleavage impaired 
virions formed contained uncleaved haemagglutinin. lep cells, infectious
virions formed virus nws-d; viruses ws-mk r12 induced synthesis 
of virus crna, vrna, proteins rnp; virus r12 haemagglutinin cleaved, 
whereas virus ws-mk process impaired; neither virus ws-mk r12 was
capable forming virions. analysis recombinant r12 genome showed it
had inherited single gene nws-d, one coding neuraminidase,
having inherited others (p1, p2, p3, ha, np, m, ns) ws-mk. data
obtained suggested inability virus ws-mk form infectious virions
in hef cells due character neuraminidase, incapable 
participating haemagglutinin cleavage. deficient reproduction this
virus host-cell system (lep) apparently associated some
characteristics another protein (other proteins) virus.
