urine samples increasingly used diagnosing infections including
escherichia coli, ebola virus, zika virus. however, extraction and
concentration nucleic acid biomarkers urine necessary many
molecular detection strategies polymerase chain reaction (pcr). since
urine samples typically large volumes dilute biomarker concentrations
making prone false negatives, another impediment urine-based
diagnostics establishment appropriate controls particularly rule out
false negatives. study, mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(gapdh) dna target added retrospectively collected urine samples from
tuberculosis (tb)-infected tb-uninfected patients indicate extraction of
intact dna removal pcr inhibitors urine samples. tested this
design surrogate urine samples, retrospective 1milliliter (ml) urine samples
from patients lima, peru retrospective 5ml urine samples patients 
cape town, south africa. extraction/pcr control dna detectable 97% of
clinical samples statistically significant differences among groups.
despite inclusion control, difference amount of
tb is6110 tr-dna detected tb-infected tb-uninfected groups except for
samples known hiv-infected patients. found increase tb is6110
tr-dna tb/hiv co-infected patients compared tb-uninfected/hiv-infected
patients (n=18, p=0.037). inclusion extraction/pcr control dna to
indicate successful dna extraction removal pcr inhibitors easily
adaptable sample preparation control acellular sample types.
