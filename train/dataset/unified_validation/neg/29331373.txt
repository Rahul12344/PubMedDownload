dermal papilla (dp) regulates growth cycling hair follicles. cultured 
dp cells useful study role relation hair growth and
regeneration. however, cultivation human dp cells tedious difficult. in
addition, cultured dp cells possess relatively short replicative life span,
requiring immortalized human dp cell lines. previously established an
immortalized human dp cell line, sv40t-htert-dpc, introducing human telomerase
reverse transcriptase (htert) gene transformed cell line, sv40t-dpc. 
this study, co-transfected simian virus 40 large antigen (sv40t-ag) 
htert dp cells scalp hair follicles male androgenetic
alopecia established five immortalized dp cell lines named knu-101,
knu-102, knu-103, knu-201 knu-202. evaluated tumorigenicity,
expression dp markers, responses androgen, wnt3a bmp4, expression
of dp signature genes. cell lines displayed early passage morphology and
maintained responses androgen, wnt bmp. furthermore, cell lines
expressed dp markers dp signature genes. knu cell lines established this
study potentially useful sources hair research.
