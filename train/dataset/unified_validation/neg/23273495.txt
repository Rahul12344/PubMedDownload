background: chronic hepatitis b treatment oral antiviral drugs long
course. course, antiviral resistance serious issue,
particularly, genetically low barrier drugs use. host immunity is
accepted effect antiviral resistance development. earliest
clinical sign drug resistance virologic breakthrough. study, we
aimed investigate relation hla-dqb1 alleles virologic
breakthrough events.
subjects methods: patient records single institution hepatology clinic
were reviewed. local institution ethics committee approval taken. the
patients' demographic data, virologic parameters, treatment statues noted.
patients received lamivudine adefovir recruited grouped 
two according virologic breakthrough occurrence. patients not
compliant given treatment excluded. blood samples taken dna 
extraction. hla-dqb1 alleles determined high level sequence-speciﬁc
primers-polymerase chain reaction. distribution dqb1 alleles among groups 
was analyzed.
results: one hundred ninety-eight patients eligible study.
ninety-six virologic breakthrough 102 have. dqb1 0503
allele frequent patients without breakthrough (28.4% vs. 12.4%,
p=0.006). univariate analysis, hbeag seropositivity (p<0.001), absence of
cirrhosis (p=0.007), younger age (p=0.002) higher pretreatment logdna
(p<0.001) related breakthrough events. however, multivariate analysis 
only logdna (p<0.001) dqb1*0503 (p=0.02) allele revealed statistically
significant relation breakthrough events.
conclusion: host immunity may effect outcome treatment with
oral antiviral drugs. patient better immunologic profile may suppress 
viral replication better may cause less resistance occurrence during
treatment genetically low barrier drugs.
