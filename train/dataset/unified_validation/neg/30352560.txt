background: herpes simplex encephalitis common type sporadic
encephalitis worldwide. frank intracerebral hemorrhage complicating disease
course herpes simplex encephalitis patients rare, especially cases where
surgical decompression necessary. here, report previously healthy female 
with herpes simplex encephalitis underwent surgical decompression due to
temporal lobe hemorrhage.
case presentation: previously healthy 34-year-old korean female presented 
fever, myalgia severe headache. brain mri showed high t2 signal intensity
change diffuse swelling right temporal lobe. polymerase chain reaction
testing cerebrospinal fluid confirmed presence herpes simplex virus
1. patient admitted close observation intravenous acyclovir. on
hospital day 3, sudden onset vomiting severe headache. brain ct 
showed frank temporal lobe hemorrhage. despite aggressive medical treatment, 
became increasingly drowsy. ultimately, underwent emergency right
decompressive craniectomy, expansile duraplasty intracranial pressure monitor
insertion. patient recovered fully without neurological deficits or
neuropsychological problems. discharged completion 2 weeks of
acyclovir returned 2 months later cranioplasty.
conclusions: patients severe herpes simplex encephalitis complicated by
intracerebral hemorrhage malignant cerebral edema undergo aggressive
medical treatment. surgical decompression also actively considered in
these severe cases prevent neurological deterioration.
