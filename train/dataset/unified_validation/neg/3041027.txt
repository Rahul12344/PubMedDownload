we investigated effect e26, avian leukemia retrovirus, the
growth properties chicken embryo fibroblasts (cefs). e26-infected cefs were
not transformed, according several transformation parameters, exhibited an
activated growth vitro. started grow without latency in
serum-supplemented medium, maintained long-term growth regular low-serum
medium, could grow seeded low cell density low-serum medium. we
compared integration level expression proviral dna in
e26-infected cefs e26-transformed hematopoietic cells. average two
provirus copies found kind cells. however, whereas high contents 
of viral mrna e26-specific protein products found transformed
hematopoietic cells, detected low amounts viral mrna e26
protein infected cefs. data show level expression e26
provirus lower cefs hematopoietic cells. suggest that
transformation efficiency virus depends level expression.
