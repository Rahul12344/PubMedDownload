construction biological analysis deletion mutants fujinami sarcoma
virus: 5'-fps sequence role transforming activity.

ariizumi k, shibuya m.

fujinami sarcoma virus (fsv) genome codes gag-fps fusion protein
fsv-p130. amino acid sequence 3' one-third portion v-fps is
partially homologous 3' half pp60src, kinase domain, the
sequence 5' portion unique v-fps. identify possible domain
structure v-fps sequence responsible cell transformation, we
constructed various deletion mutants fsv molecularly cloned viral dna.
their transforming activities assayed measuring focus formation on
chicken embryo fibroblasts rat 3y1 cells tumor formation chickens. the
mutants carrying deletion 3' portion v-fps, kinase domain, lost
transforming activity. mutants carrying approximately 1-kilobase deletion 
within 5' portion v-fps sequence retained focus-forming activity and
tumorigenicity chicken system, efficiency focus formation was
about 10 times lower wild type. morphology these
transformed cells distinct observed cells infected with
wild-type fsv. furthermore, mutants could transform rat 3y1 cells,
although wild-type fsv dna transformed rat 3y1 cells high frequency. the
mutants carrying larger deletion 5' portion fps completely lacked the
transforming activity. results suggest 3' portion v-fps
sequence necessary sufficient cell transformation 5' 
portion v-fps role transforming activity.
