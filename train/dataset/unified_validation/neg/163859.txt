spleen cell-mediated cytotoxicity hamster cells transformed herpes simplex 
virus: evidence virus-specific membrane antigen.

lausch rn, jones c, christie d, hay ka, rapp f.

the nature host's immune response isografts hamster embryo
fibroblasts (hef) transformed herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) was
investigated microcytotoxicity assay. found spleen cells 
tumor-bearing hamsters killed homologous tumor cells hef transformed by
cytomegalovirus para-(defective sv40)-adenovirus 7 (para-7). cytotoxicity 
lost tumor increased size. spleen cells animals bearing isografts 
of hsv type 2 (hsv-2) transformed cells also killed hsv-1 target cells whereas
spleen cells para-7 tumor bearers not. studies showed that
animals immunized hsv-1 hsv-1-infected rabbit kidney cells produced
spleen cells specifically cytotoxic hsv-transformed cells. hand,
sera virus-immunized hosts tumor bearers effect cells in
the presence guinea pig complement. however, blocking experiments sera
could significantly reduce spleen cell cytotoxicity. experiments
established cells transformed hsv could elicit cellular immune response
in syngeneic host, provided evidence immunity directed
against virus-specific antigens cell surface.
