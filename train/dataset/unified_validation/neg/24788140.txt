background/aim: hepatitis b virus (hbv) mutations play role development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). however, association hbv
polymerase gene mutations hcc reported. study, we
conducted multi-stage study identify hcc-related mutations reverse
transcriptase (rt) domain hbv polymerase gene.
methods: total 231 hccs 237 non-hcc controls qidong, china, were
included study. entire sequence hbv rt first compared 
29 hcc 35 non-hcc cases, candidate mutations evaluated two
independent validation sets.
results: 15 candidate mutations identified discovery set,
with a799g t1055a consistently associated hcc across studies. 
a pooled analysis samples revealed a799g, a987g, t1055a were
independent risk factors hcc, adjusted odds ratios 5.53 [95%
confidence interval (ci), 1.69-18.10], 4.20 (95%ci, 1.15-15.35), 3.78 (95%ci,
1.45-9.86), respectively. longitudinal study showed mutations were
detectable 4-5 years prior hcc diagnosis.
conclusions: study provides evidence first hbv rt contains naturally
occurring mutations used predictive markers hcc.
