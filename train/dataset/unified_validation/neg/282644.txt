genetic dimorphism influenza viruses: characterization stably associated
hemagglutinin mutants differing antigenicity biological properties.

influenza virus recombinant x-53 produced use 1976 national
immunization program swine influenza found comprise two types of
virions differing antigenic, replicative, plaque-forming
characteristics. one type, characteristic x-53 designated "l," was
relatively low-yielding chicken embryos, produced small clear plaques in
madin-darby dog kidney cells, selectively inhibited heterotypic
antibody a/sw/cam/39 strain swine influenza virus. other, x-53a 
"h," high-yielding chicken embryos, produced large turbid plaques dog
kidney cells, inhibited concentrations a/sw/cam/39 antisera
inhibitory x-53. shown a/nj/11/76 (hswn1) virus, x-53
was derived, five swine influenza virus isolates humans pigs
were dimorphic mixtures two types virus. segregation the

apparent ubiquity two mutants nature, suggests another
example viral dimorphism-the stable association two allelic mutants. of
