the molecular biological characteristics burkitt lymphoma (bl), addition to
the presence epstein-barr virus (ebv) forms, relies on
well-characterized alterations, myc translocations tp53
inactivations. ascertain number location genome alterations, 
we used 191 polymorphic markers genome-wide search loss of
heterozygosity (loh) 31 burkitt lymphoma cell lines normal
counterparts. able distinguish two types altered allelic patterns: 
a bona fide loh profile, indicative deletion (loh), profile indicative
of increased dosage (id). former type frequent chromosome arm
17p, likely indicating tp53 gene inactivation. increased dosage 1q was
found almost exclusively non-ebv cell lines (p < 0.00004) correlated well 
with karyotypic abnormalities affecting region 1q21-25. results suggest 
a gene important bl pathogenesis located region 1q21-25 the
activation gene mimics effects ebv.
