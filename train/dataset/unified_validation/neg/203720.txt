polyoma virus complementary rna, synthesized vitro using highly purified
escherichia coli rna polymerase nondefective form polyoma dna, was
translated wheat germ cell-free system. polypeptides synthesized that
comigrated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels polyoma capsid 
proteins vp1 vp2, although cell-free products smaller
molecular weights. vp1-size protein specifically immunoprecipitated with
anti-polyoma virus serum, upon digestion trypsin yielded
[35s]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides co-chromatographed the
[3h]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides virion-derived vp1 both
cation-exchange anion-exchange resins. vp2-size vitro product
contained virion vp2 methionine-labeled tryptic peptides, shown by
cation- anion-exchange chromatography two-dimensional fingerprinting on
cellulose. conclude full-length polyoma vp1 vp2 synthesized in
response complementary rna consequently viral capsid proteins
vp1, vp2, vp3 entirely virus coded.
