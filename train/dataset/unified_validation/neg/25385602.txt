the influenza virus (iav) genome divided eight distinct rna segments
believed copackaged virions nearly perfect efficiency. here, we
describe mutation iav nucleoprotein (np) enhances replication and
transmission guinea pigs selectively reducing neuraminidase (na) gene
segment packaging virions. show incomplete iav particles lacking
gene segments contribute propagation viral population through
multiplicity reactivation conditions widespread coinfection, we
demonstrate commonly occurs upper respiratory tract guinea pigs. np
also dramatically altered functional balance viral glycoproteins on
particles selectively decreasing na expression. findings reveal novel
functions np selective control iav gene packaging balancing
glycoprotein expression suggest role incomplete gene packaging during
host adaptation transmission.
