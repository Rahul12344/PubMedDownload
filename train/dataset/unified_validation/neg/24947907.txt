despite global oceanic distribution recognised biogeochemical impact of
coccolithoviruses (ehv), diversity remains poorly understood. we
employed metagenomic approach study occurrence progression of
natural ehv community genomic variability. analysis ehv metagenomes the
early late stages induced bloom led three main discoveries. first,
we observed resilient specific genomic signatures ehv community
associated norwegian coast, reinforce existence limitations
to capacity dispersal genomic exchange among ehv populations. second, 
we identified hyper-variable region (approximately 21kbp long) the
coccolithovirus genome. third, observed clear trend ehv relative
amino-acid diversity reduce early late stages bloom. study
validated two new methodological combinations, proved useful the
discovery new genomic features associated coccolithovirus natural
communities.
