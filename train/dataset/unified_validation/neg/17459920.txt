human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) lytic dna replication initiated complex
cis-acting orilyt region, spans nearly 3 kb. dna synthesis requires six
core proteins together ul84 ie2. previously, two essential regions 
identified within orilyt. essential region (nucleotides [nt] 92209 92573)
can replaced constitutively active simian virus 40 promoter, in
turn eliminates requirement ie2 origin-dependent
transient-replication assay. essential region ii (nt 92979 93513) contains two
elements interest: rna/dna hybrid domain inverted repeat sequence
capable forming stem-loop structure. studies reveal first
time ul84 interacts stem-loop rna oligonucleotide vitro, and
although ul84 interacted nucleic acid substrates, specific
interaction occurred rna stem-loop. increasing concentrations of
purified ul84 produced remarkable downward-staircase pattern, due 
to nuclease activity dependent upon presence secondary
structures, suggesting ul84 modifies conformation rna substrate. 
cross-linking experiments show ul84 possibly changes conformation the
rna substrate. addition purified ie2 vitro binding reaction 
not affect binding stem-loop structure. chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays performed using infected cells purified virus show ul84 bound 
to orilyt region adjacent rna/dna hybrid stem-loop structure.
these results solidify ul84 potential initiator hcmv dna replication
through unique interaction conserved rna stem-loop structure within
orilyt.
