to probe macromolecular structure scrapie agent explore conditions
for monomerization, stability agent low concentrations inorganic
ions determined. reduction factor 10(5) scrapie titer found 
on exposure agent 1 kscn 0.3 naoh. addition the
inactivation thiocyanate ions, chaotropic ions guanidinium and
trichloroacetate inactivate scrapie agent. removal thiocyanate ions by
dialysis glass permeation chromatography prevented reduction scrapie
agent infectivity. addition equimolar amounts (nh4)2so4, nonchaotrope, to
preparations containing 1 kscn also prevented loss scrapie infectivity. 
in contrast, neutralization alkali-treated fractions hcl not
restore infectivity. acidification partially purified fractions cause 
inactivation agent result precipitation infectious
agent. inactivation relatively low concentrations chaotropic ions is
consistent many observations, suggest scrapie agent
contains protein component essential maintenance of
infectivity. thus, unlikely agent composed "naked"
nucleic acid. certainly, agent naked nucleic acid, lability 
alkali virtually eliminates possibility composed a
single-stranded molecule dna.
