we able isolate high-affinity rnas random pool binds to
integrase protein human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 using the
procedure known selex. generally, rnas fell three different
classes binding buffer containing 250 mm nacl: group class molecules
binds integrase dissociation constant (kd) order 10 nm, group ii
molecules kd 80 nm, group iii 800 nm. rna the
highest affinity group class molecules, designated p5, was
characterized using computer modeling, chemical enzymatic probing, and
deletion analysis. secondary structure model rna suggests
interactions looped-out fixed nucleotides nucleotides the
randomized region; gnra tetraloop also structure. showed 
integrase able process u5 mimic vitro. p5 competes effectively for
binding double-stranded dna mimic u5 180 mm nacl concentration.
