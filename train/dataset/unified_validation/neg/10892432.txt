mice distributed groups inoculated herpes virus simplex type 1
and type 2 strains various dilutions (10(-1)-10(-7)), been
maintained primary human embryo cell cultures. animals killed and
homogenates prepared brains, used testing the
infective titre vivo isolation nuclei, means the
hymer-kuff technique. cytokaryological examinations, smears prepared
from homogenate, stained may-grünwald-giemsa mann methods. 
the cell nucleus types evaluated morphologically, descriptively,
according size structure. basis three criteria following
groups set up: large sized cells bulky nuclei; middle sized cells 
nuclei medium size; small sized cells small nuclei visible
nucleoli; small sized cells small, tachychromatic nuclei; cells exhibiting
karyolysis. infection herpes virus simplex type 1 type 2,
the small sized cells small tachychromatic nuclei represent highest
rate. variants elaborated models significant differences
regarding cell nucleus types recorded. whole, the
cytokaryological picture exhibit notable differences, rather
resemblances respect proportionality nucleus types the
experimental variants studied, case herpes simplex virus type 1 2
induced infections.
