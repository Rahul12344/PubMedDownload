the 3'-end mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) genomic rna contains recognition
sequence (55 nucleotides [nt]) required minus-strand rna synthesis. to
determine whether 3'-end sequence also involved subgenomic mrna
transcription, constructed mhv defective interfering (di) rnas which
contain chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene placed behind an
intergenic sequence 3'-end sequence various degrees internal
deletions. di rnas transfected mhv-infected cells, cat
activities, represent subgenomic mrna transcription intergenic
site, determined. results demonstrated deletions sequence
upstream 350 nt 3'-end, include 3'-untranslated region
(3'-utr), mhv genomic rna affect subgenomic mrna transcription.
however, deletions reduced 3'-end sequences 270 nt less completely
abolished mrna transcription despite fact clones
synthesized minus-strand rnas. results indicated mrna transcription
from intergenic site mhv di rna requires 3'-utr a
cis-acting signal, likely exerts effects plus-strand rna
synthesis. substitution corresponding bovine coronavirus sequence for
the mhv sequence within nt 270 305 3'-end abrogated cat gene
expression, suggesting rigid sequence requirement region. the
deletion putative pseudoknot structure within 3'-utr also abolished 
cat gene expression. findings suggest 3'-utr may interact the
other rna regulatory elements regulate mrna transcription.
