background: pandemic potential avian influenza a/h5n1 be
overlooked, continued development vaccines highly
pathogenic viruses public health priority.
methods: open-label extension booster study followed phase iii study of
1206 adults received two 3.75 μg doses primary as03a-adjuvanted or
non-adjuvanted h5n1 split-virus vaccine (a/vietnam/1194/2004; clade 1)
(nct00449670). aim extension study evaluate different timings
for heterologous as03a-adjuvanted booster vaccination (a/indonesia/5/2005; clade 
2.1) given month 6, 12, 36 post-primary vaccination. immunogenicity was
assessed 21 days booster vaccination persistence immune
responses primary vaccine strain (a/vietnam) booster strain
(a/indonesia) evaluated month 48 post-primary vaccination.
reactogenicity safety also assessed.
results: booster vaccination given month 6, hi antibody responses to
primary vaccine, booster vaccine strains markedly higher one dose
of as03a-h5n1 booster vaccine as03a-adjuvanted primary vaccine group
compared two doses booster vaccine non-adjuvanted primary vaccine 
group. hi antibody responses robust primary booster vaccine 
strains 21 days boosting month 12 36. month 48, subjects
boosted month 6, 12, 36, hi antibody titers ≥1:40 booster
strain persisted 39.2%, 61.2%, 95.6% subjects, respectively.
neutralizing antibody responses cell-mediated immune responses also showed
that as03a-h5n1 heterologous booster vaccination elicited robust immune responses
within 21 days boosting month 6, 12, 36 post-primary vaccination. the
booster vaccine well tolerated, safety concerns raised.
conclusions: asian adults primed two doses as03a-adjuvanted h5n1
pandemic influenza vaccine, strong cross-clade anamnestic antibody responses were
observed one dose as03a-h5n1 heterologous booster vaccine given month
6, 12, 36 priming, suggesting as03a-adjuvanted h5n1 vaccines may
provide highly flexible prime-boost schedules. although immunogenicity decreased 
with time, vaccinated populations could potentially protected three 
years vaccination, likely far exceed peak a
pandemic.
