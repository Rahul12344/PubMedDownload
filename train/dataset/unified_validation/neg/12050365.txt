we show dna helicase activity parvoviral initiator protein
ns1 highly directional, binding single strand recessed 5' end 
displacing strand progressing 3'-to-5' direction the
bound strand. ns1 cellular site-specific dna binding factor, pif, also
known glucocorticoid modulating element binding protein, bind left-end 
minimal replication origin minute virus mice, forming ternary complex. in
this complex, ns1 activated nick one dna strand, becoming covalently
attached 5' end nick process providing 3' oh for
priming dna synthesis. situation, helicase activity ns1 not
displace nicked strand, origin duplex distorted ns1-pif
complex, assayed sensitivity kmno(4) oxidation, stretch of
about 14 nucleotides strands nicked origin underwent limited
unwinding. addition escherichia coli single-stranded dna binding protein (ssb)
did lead unwinding. however, addition recombinant human
single-stranded dna binding protein (rpa) initiation reaction catalyzed
extensive unwinding nicked origin, suggesting rpa may required 
form functional replication fork. accordingly, unwinding mediated ns1
and rpa promoted processive leading-strand synthesis catalyzed recombinant
human dna polymerase delta, pcna, rfc, using minimal left-end origin
cloned plasmid template. requirement rpa, rather ssb, in
the unwinding reaction indicated specific ns1-rpa protein interactions 
formed. ns1 tested enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding two-
or three-subunit rpa complexes expressed recombinant baculoviruses. ns1
efficiently bound baculovirus-expressed complexes, indicating that
the small subunit rpa involved specific ns1 binding. ns1
interactions observed e. coli ssb proteins included as
controls.
