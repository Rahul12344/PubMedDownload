a safe effective direct acting anti-hepatitis c virus (hcv) agent still
needed. study, human single chain variable fragments antibody (scfvs) 
that bound hcv ns3/4a protein produced phage display technology. the
engineered scfvs linked nonaarginines (r9) making cell
penetrable. hcv-rna-transfected huh7 cells treated transbodies produced 
from four different transformed e. coli clones reduced hcv-rna inside the
cells cell spent media, well fewer hcv foci cell
monolayer compared transfected cells culture medium alone. the
transbodies-treated transfected cells also up-expression genes coding 
for host innate immune response, including trif, traf3, irf3, il-28b, and
ifn-Î². computerized homology modeling intermolecular docking predicted that
the effective transbodies interacted several critical residues ns3/4a
protease, including form catalytic triads, oxyanion loop, s1 and
s6 pockets, well zinc-binding site. although insight molecular
mechanisms transbodies need laboratory investigation, be
deduced current data transbodies blocked hcv ns3/4a
protease activities, leading hcv replication inhibition restoration of
the virally suppressed host innate immunity. engineered antibodies 
tested treatment hcv infection either alone, combination with
current therapeutics, mixture cognates specific hcv
proteins.
