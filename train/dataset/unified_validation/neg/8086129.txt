objective: examine b-cell stimulatory properties regulatory nef
protein hiv-1.
methods: effect hiv-1 regulatory proteins nef, tat vif, were
analyzed ability induce differentiation normal b lymphocytes into
immunoglobulin secreting cells (isc).
results: recombinant nef protein, neither tat vif, able induce
isc peripheral blood lymphocyte (pbl) cultures hiv-1-seronegative donors.
another recombinant nef protein, d-nef, truncated amino terminal (deletion
of 34 amino acids) failed induce b-cell differentiation. pretreatment the
nef protein polyclonal anti-nef-antibody abrogated b-cell stimulatory 
activity. nef-induced b-cell differentiation dependent cell-to-cell
contact. cell surface molecules leukocyte function-associated molecule (lfa)-1,
intracellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1, human lymphocyte antigen-dr b7 were
involved t-b-cell interaction monoclonal antibodies these
molecules abrogated nef-induced b-cell differentiation response. nef
protein able induce interleukin (il)-6 messenger (m)rna il-6 protein
secretion pbl, monocytes primary source.
conclusions: findings indicate regulatory (nef) proteins hiv-1
contribute intense b-cell activation occurs association hiv-1
infection. t-b-cell contact-dependent interaction induction il-6 
proteins appear play major roles process.
