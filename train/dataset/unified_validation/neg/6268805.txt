fine-structure mapping herpes simplex virus type 1 temperature-sensitive
mutations within short repeat region genome.

preston vg.

cloned herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) dna fragments used to
fine-structure map temperature-sensitive (ts) lesions four mutants, ts
t, d, c75, k, marker rescue. mutants overproduced
immediate-early viral polypeptides nonpermissive temperature. although one
of viruses, ts k, gave restricted infected-cell polypeptide profile 
under conditions three, complementation detected
between pairwise crosses mutants yield test. recombination,
however, obtained mutant pairs except ts d. physical
mapping experiments, ts+ virus recovered cells coinfected dna ts
t, d, c75 bamhi fragment k wild-type strain 17 hsv-1 dna cloned in
pat153, whereas ts k rescued cloned hsv-1 bamhi-y. cloned
dna fragments contained sequences short repeat region hsv-1
genome. ts mutations precisely mapped marker rescue, using
restriction enzyme fragments within bamhi-k -y cloned dna. smallest 
fragment able rescue mutant 320 base pairs long. order four
mutations derived studies consistent assignment by
genetic recombination. four lesions mapped within coding sequences the
immediate-early polypeptide vmw ie 175 (icp4) lie outside "a" sequence.
the results showed mutations different regions gene encoding vmw
ie 175 could produce similar phenotype effects nonpermissive temperature.
