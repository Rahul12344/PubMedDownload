mononucleosis. two additional cases reported serologic identification of
epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection blood cerebrospinal fluid. with
previously described cases, outcome benign, examination and
laboratory studies indicate diffuse neurologic involvement. visual and
brainstem auditory-evoked responses normal. electroencephalograms (eeg)
demonstrated 14 6 per second positive spikes patients. pattern
is considered normal variant recorded depth electrodes and
reported deep midline lesions. cases support prognosis benign
