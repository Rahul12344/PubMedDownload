viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv) genotype iva causes mass mortality in
wild pacific herring, species economic value, northeast pacific
ocean. young year herring particularly susceptible carriers
of virus. understand pathogenesis, tissue cellular tropisms of
vhsv larval juvenile pacific herring investigated with
immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, viral tissue titer.
in larval herring, early viral tropism epithelial tissues (6d post-exposure) 
was indicated foci epidermal thickening contained heavy concentrations
of virus. followed cellular tropism fibroblasts within fin 
bases dermis, expanded cells kidney, liver, pancreas,
gastrointestinal tract meninges brain. among wild juvenile herring
that underwent vhs epizootic laboratory, disease characterized
by acute chronic phases death. fish died acute phase had
systemic infections tissues including submucosa gastrointestinal
tract, spleen, kidney, liver, meninges. disease transitioned 
chronic phase characterized appearance neurological signs
including erratic corkscrew swimming darkening dorsal skin. during
the chronic phase viral persistence occurred nervous tissues including
meninges brain parenchymal cells one case peripheral nerves, 
virus mostly cleared tissues. results demonstrate the
varying vhsv tropisms dependent timing infection importance 
neural tissues persistence perpetuation chronic infections in
pacific herring.
