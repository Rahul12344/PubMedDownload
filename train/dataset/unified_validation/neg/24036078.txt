vpu 81 amino acid type integral membrane protein encoded human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). identified support viral release 
by potentially forming ion substrate conducting channels modulating
the function host factors. focus interaction the
transmembrane domains vpu host factors using combination of
molecular dynamics simulations docking approach. binding poses adopted
tilt angles dimers analyzed correlated experimentally derived
activity data literature. vpu activity driven dimerization the
host protein via alanine rim ala-8/11/15/19. tight binding shown an
almost parallel alignment helices dimers. less parallel alignment
is proposed correlate lower activity. article part special
