bronchocentric granulomatosis unusual pathologic entity is
characterized necrotizing granulomatous inflammation surrounding the

examination open-lung biopsy resection pulmonary lesion. although
the aetiology fully elucidated, current pathogenetic mechanism
is considered immunologic reaction endobronchial antigens, since
most patients exhibit signs bronchial asthma, eosinophilia allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. however, non-asthmatic patients may develop
bronchocentric granulomatosis without signs endobronchial fungal infections, 
but probably consequence pulmonary infections. 80-year-old
female patient presented high fever bilateral pulmonary infiltrates 
nodules. extensive investigations open-lung biopsy, diagnosis
bronchocentric granulomatosis established possibly associated with
an influenza-a virus infection. treatment consisted immunosuppressive drugs
(prednisone cyclophosphamide), led complete clinical and
radiological recovery.
