whereas others little effect. interference interferon system 
has suggested possible mechanism viral infection-enhancing
(vie) activity hormones. present study, steroids (prednisolone,

demonstrated vie activity mayaro virus infection. suggested that
the vie activity hormone may dependent viral agent used for
challenge. data also presented suggest that, addition to
interference interferon system, vie activity steroid hormones may
be result least two actions: (i) alteration cell membranes;
