we show single dna molecule confined extended nanochannel 
dynamically compressed sliding permeable gasket fixed velocity relative
to stationary polymer. gasket realized experimentally optically
trapping nanosphere inside nanochannel. trapped bead acts like a
"nanodozer," directly applying compressive forces molecule without
requirement chemical attachment. remarkably, strongly nonequilibrium
measurements quantified via simple nonlinear convective-diffusion
formalism yield insights local blob statistics, allowing us to
conclude compressed nanochannel-confined chain exhibits mean-field
behavior.
