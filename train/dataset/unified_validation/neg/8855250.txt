the mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) promoter regulated steroid hormones
through hormone-responsive region organized positioned nucleosome.
hormone induction leads structural change nucleosome makes its
dna sensitive cleavage dnase enables simultaneous binding all
relevant transcription factors. cells carrying either episomal or
chromosomally integrated mmtv promoters, moderate acetylation core histones,
generated treatment low concentrations histone deacetylase
inhibitors sodium butyrate trichostatin a, enhances transcription the
mmtv promoter absence hormone potentiates transactivation either
glucocorticoids progestins. higher concentrations, histone deacetylase
inhibitors reduce basal hormone induced mmtv transcription. inducing
inhibitor concentrations lead type nucleosomal dnase i
hypersensitivity hormone treatment, suggesting moderate acetylation of
core histone activates mmtv promoter mechanisms involving chromatin
remodeling similar generated inducing hormones.
