background: ganciclovir demonstrated immunosuppressive effects vitro which
may lead delayed cytomegalovirus (cmv)-specific immune reconstitution the
drug given prophylactically. maribavir new potent anti-cmv drug 
that evaluation therapeutic use transplant recipients.
objectives: objective study evaluate potential effect of
maribavir cmv-specific cell function comparison ganciclovir.
study design: ten immunocompetent cmv seropositive donors, maribavir and
ganciclovir compared broad range concentrations (0.2-500μm)
regarding effects lymphoproliferation, cmv-specific cd4+ cd8+
cytokine expression, cell multifunctionality, degranulation apoptosis.
results: maribavir inhibited lymphocyte proliferation concentrations 50μm
and above, however, cytokine expression, cellular degranulation and
multifunctionality cd4+ cd8+ cells response cmv lysate pp65
peptide mix impaired except highest concentration 500μm.
ganciclovir inhibited lymphoproliferative responses starting 10μm. with
maribavir, cellular responses following stimulation cmv lysate and
pp65 peptide mix impaired highest concentration 500μm of
ganciclovir. neither maribavir ganciclovir showed induction lymphocyte
apoptosis.
conclusions: maribavir exhibits low potential suppress cmv-specific cell
function. finding supports use higher doses prophylactic
setting originally proposed.
