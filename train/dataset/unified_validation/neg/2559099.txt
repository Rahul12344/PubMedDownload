results condylomatous, dysplastic and/or neoplastic epithelial changes. to
enable routine screening premalignant cervical lesions hpv dna, have
developed sensitive method detecting hpv -6, -11, -16, -18 -33 in
cervical scrapes using non-isotopic, dot-blot hybridization assay. cloned,
genomic hpv dna labelled biotin-11-dutp nick translation, used 
screen hpv types high stringency conditions. dna extracted from
cervical cells spotted nitrocellulose membranes. cervical cells, 20
patients attending colposcopy screened hpv types. patients a
dysplasia condyloma. hpv dna isolated 80%. method visualized an
amount target dna low 1 pg without background. compared southern
blot hybridization utilizing radiolabelled probe, assay equally sensitive
and specific. technique easy do, may significantly contribute to
the management cervical dysplasia.
