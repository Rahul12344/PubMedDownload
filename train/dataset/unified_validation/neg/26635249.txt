understanding mechanism protective antibody recognition highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 humans critical development
of effective therapies vaccines. report crystal structure of
three h5-specific human monoclonal antibodies bound globular head of
hemagglutinin (ha) distinct epitope specificities, neutralization potencies 
and breadth. structural functional analysis epitopes combined with
those reported elsewhere identifies four major vulnerable sites globular

generated delineate broad neutralization specificities convalescent sera
from two individuals recovered infection h5n1 virus. our
results show four vulnerable sites globular head rather

to provide protective antibody-mediated immunity.
