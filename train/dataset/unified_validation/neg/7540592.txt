analysis five monoclonal autoantibodies, rheumatoid factors produced by
hybridomas generated spleen cells balb/c mice repeatedly infected with
a/pr/8/34 human influenza virus, revealed recognized distinct but
spatially related epitopes. differing isoallotypic specificity igm and
iga monoclonal antibodies correlated presence ile258 ala305,
respectively. although data suggest epitopes recognized within
the ch2 domain, antibodies failed inhibit igg antigen reactivity with
staphylococcus aureus protein (spa), c1q, mouse c3, human fc gamma ri mouse 
fc gamma rii, activities known predominantly determined ch2 domain
structures. reactivity iga antibody, z34, igg2b allowed further
specificity studies using panel 26 mutant igg2b proteins, single
amino acid replacements surface ch2 domain. substitution
that affected z34 reactivity asn/ala297, destroyed glycosylation
sequon, resulting secretion aglycosylated igg molecule. epitope
recognized z34 therefore seems located outside fc gamma r c1q
binding sites, dependent presence carbohydrate for
expression. contrast binding studies, complement activation by
aggregated igg2a, classical alternative pathways, inhibited the
presence autoantibodies. functional significance isotype-specific
autoantibody immune regulation discussed.
