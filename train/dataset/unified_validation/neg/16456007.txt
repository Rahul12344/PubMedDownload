cytolytic cd8(+) cells (ctl) key immune response controls virus
infections mediates disease protection. ability ctl induce
apoptosis infected cells and/or limit viral replication determined by
recognition processed viral peptide epitopes surface target
cell. understudied source mhc class i-presented peptides aptly named
"cryptic epitopes," defined nontraditional methods generation,
including derivation alternative reading frames (arfs). although arf-encoded
epitopes documented systems, potential functional
relevance vivo debated. study, demonstrate the
physiological significance arf-derived ctl epitope retrovirus-induced 
disease model. show disease-susceptible cd8-deficient mice reconstituted 
with ctl specific retroviral arf-derived syntgrfppl epitope controlled an
infection lp-bm5 retrovirus isolate, evidently level viral
clearance, resulting protection mice disease. data
indicate arf-derived epitopes indeed relevant inducers immune
system demonstrate importance atypically generated peptides as
functional ag physiologic role disease protection.
