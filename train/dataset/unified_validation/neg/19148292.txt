we previously reported efficacy nonmyeloablative allogeneic
transplantation 2 hiv positive recipients, one received retrovirus
transduced hematopoietic stem cells confer resistance hiv. report
an assessment retroviral integration sites (riss) recovered 3 years
post-transplantation. identified 213 unique riss patient's peripheral
blood samples linear amplification-mediated pcr (lam-pcr). vector
integration patterns similar previously reported, 3.76% riss
were common among early (up 3 months) late samples (beyond 1 year).
additionally, common integration sites enriched among late samples (14.9%
vs. 36.8%, respectively). three riss found near within known oncogenes,
but 2 limited early timepoints. interestingly, integration site near
the mds1 gene detected long-term follow-up samples; however, overall
contribution mds1 integrated clone remained stably low follow-up.
