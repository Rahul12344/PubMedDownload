ctl recognize peptides derived protein ags bound mhc-class molecules.
proteasomes probably participate generation peptide epitopes. 
investigated role proteasomes presentation endogenously
synthesized short viral proteins. end, employed proteasome and
cysteine protease inhibitors two closely related recombinant vaccinia viruses
that code 17- 19-amino acid-long products encompassing murine cmv 9pp89
epitope. presentation minigene products required processing shorter
peptides independent ubiquitination. proteasomes necessary for
processing 17-mer product, cysteine proteases required. in
contrast, 19-mer product could processed parallel either proteasomes
or cysteine proteases independently. results highlight diversity 
alternative processing pathways even short peptidic ags, provide evidence for
the involvement cysteine proteases mhc class presentation, show 
cleavage cysteine proteases governed sequences flanking epitope.
