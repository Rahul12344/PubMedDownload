the tumor necrosis factor receptor family molecule cd30 expressed activated
and memory cells, depending il-4 stimulation preferentially association
with th0- th2-type responses. mediates pleiotropic effects primarily of
the inhibitory type. arguing cd30(+) cells peculiar redistribution in
disease, demonstrated here, hodgkin-derived l540 cell line (an
established model studying cd30 signaling), cd30 regulates the
prototypic lymphoid chemokine receptor cxcr4 (cd184), plays important
role many organ systems coreceptor human immunodeficiency virus-1
entry. cd30 stimulation agonistic antibodies l540 cells led the
accumulation cxcr4 mrna, reached plateau 4 hours not
require protein synthesis. reported recently cd30 up-regulates
the transcription ccr7 mrna yt lymphoma cells. mrna transcription,
membrane expression cxcr4 l540 cells increased early 12 hours,
reached plateau 24 hours (mfi +/- sd, 839 +/- 122 vs basal 168 +/- 28; p 
<.01) still increased 5 days, permitting enhanced sensitivity to
the chemotactic activity cxcr4-ligand cxcl12 (ci +/- sd, 10 +/- 1 vs basal 5
+/- 2; p <.01). cd30 cross-linking also induced release ccl5 ccl3 
the up-regulation membrane binding capacity ccl3 ccl4 decreased
proliferative activity. new regulatory role cd30 may relevant for
t-cell maturation effector responses promoting cancer biology.
