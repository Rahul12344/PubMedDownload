developmental control gene expression major impact design of
beta-globin retrovirus vectors hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy of
beta-thalassemia. obvious endogenous locus control region (lcr)
elements drive beta-globin gene expression transgenic mice must be
included vectors. however, specific elements use clear
and require understanding lcr action. moreover, retrovirus vectors contain 
silencer elements function stem cells dominant lcr function.
recent studies lcrbeta-globin transgenes retrovirus silencing suggest ways
to overcome silencing effect transfer stem cells carefully
designed lentivirus vectors exciting therapeutic benefit animal models of
beta-thalassemia. building 15 years development, lcrbeta-globin vectors 
are tested preclinical animal models may ultimately lead 
long-sought cure genetic disease.
