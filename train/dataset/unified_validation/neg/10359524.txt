ap-1 represents transcription factor, plays pivotal role initiating

the fos-related antigens fra-1 fra-2, either homo- or
heterodimerize build functional transcription complex. ap-1 mainly
considered positive regulator, binds cognate dna sequences within
the viral upstream regulatory region. using non-tumorigenic hela-fibroblast
hybrids ('444'), tumorigenic segregants ('cgl3') well hpv 18 positive
