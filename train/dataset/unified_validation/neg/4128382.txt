mason-pfizer monkey virus (mp-mv) rna virus rna-instructed dna
polymerase first isolated rhesus monkey mammary adenocarcinoma 1970.
until recently, isolates. continuous human amnion cell
line, ao, found producing virus indistinguishable closely related 
to mason-pfizer virus measured morphological, immunological, and
biochemical methods. thin-section electron microscopy, extracellular virus
particle ao line 115 130 nm diameter preformed nucleoid (80
to 90 nm) budding, properties also characteristic mp-mv. two 
proteins virus ao line studied. immunodiffusion, sera
which react specifically mp-mv give line identity virus the
ao line. ao viral rna-instructed dna polymerase purified phosphocellulose 
chromatography specifically inhibited anti-mp-mv polymerase sera, 
ao cells contained dna rna sequences related mp-mv (3)h-dna. viruses 
thus far indistinguishable mp-mv also recently found others 
different human lines, raising question species origin of
mp-mv. virus ao cells cannot differentiated mp-mv, 
attempted determine origin mp-mv virus measuring dna sequences
related mp-mv (3)h-dna uninfected human rhesus monkey cells. the
quantity mp-mv-like dna sequences uninfected primate tissues found to
be much lower amount dna sequences murine type-b type-c viruses
in uninfected murine tissues. thus, possible determine whether 
virus produced ao cells mp-mv human monkey origin, both.
