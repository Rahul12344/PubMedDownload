the specific hydrolytic activity pon1 paraoxonase/arylesterase enzymes in
liver blood provides natural barrier entry organophosphate
toxins central peripheral nervous systems. inherited differences 
pon1 enzyme concentrations may determine levels susceptibility to
organophosphate injury humans. test whether boosting serum levels pon1
enzymes gene therapy might provide increased protection, compared the
degree inactivation whole brain acetylcholinesterase mice exposed to
chlorpyrifos 4 days intravenous injection recombinant adenoviruses
containing pon1-lq pon1-lr genes pon1 gene. recombinant viruses
containing pon1 genes boosted serum arylesterase concentrations approximately 
60% significantly prevented inactivation brain acetylcholinesterase.
some mice completely protected. findings indicate boosting serum 
levels pon1 enzymes gene delivery vector raises threshold for
organophosphate toxicity hydrolytic destruction chemical enter 
the brain.
