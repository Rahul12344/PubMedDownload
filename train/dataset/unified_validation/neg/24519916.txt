to increase safety possibly efficacy hiv-1 derived lentivectors (lvs) 
as anti-cancer vaccine, recently developed nanobody (nb) display
technology target lvs antigen presenting cells (apcs). study, we
extend data exclusive targeting lvs conventional dendritic cells
(dcs), believed main cross-presenting apcs induction 
of th1-conducted antitumor immune response. immunogenicity these
dc-subtype targeted lvs compared broad tropism, general
apc-targeted non-infectious lvs. intranodal immunization ovalbumin
encoding lvs induced proliferation antigen specific cd4+ cells, irrespective
of lvs' targeting ability. however, cytokine secretion profile the
restimulated cd4+ cells demonstrated general apc targeting induced a
similar th1-profile broad tropism lvs transduction conventional
dcs alone induced similar less potent th1 profile non-infectious
lvs. observation contradicts hypothesis conventional dcs the
most important apcs suggests activation apcs also
meaningful. despite differences, targeted lvs able stimulate
cytotoxic lymphocytes, lesser extent broad tropism lvs.
furthermore induction shown dependent type interferon the
targeted non-infectious lvs, broad tropism lvs. finally we
demonstrated apc-targeted lvs potent therapy broad tropism
lvs deliver promise safer efficacious lv-based
vaccines.
