despite significant progress hepatitis c (hcv) treatment, global viral
eradication remains challenge. in-depth map genome diversity within
the context structural immunological constraints could contribute the
design pan-genotypic antivirals preventive vaccines. analyses,
extensive information available highly prevalent hcv genotypes
(gt) 1a 1b. using 647 gt1a 408 gt1b full-genome sequences obtained from
the los alamos database, found respectively 3 per cent 82 per cent of
all codon positions positive negative selective pressure,
suggesting variation mainly accumulates due random genetic drift. an
association conservation structured rna secondary protein
structures confirmed important role structural elements nucleotide 
at amino acid level. remarkably, cd8+ t-cell epitopes hcv gt1a were
significantly conserved, time containing sites 
positive selection. similarly, cd4+ t-cell epitopes significantly more
conserved hcv subtypes, less positive selective pressure in
gt1b negative selective pressure gt1a. contrast, b-cell epitopes
in subtypes less conserved less stringent negative selection.
these findings argue immune selective pressure main force of
between-host diversifying evolution. despite high variability, hcv under
strict evolutionary constraints, probably keep genes proteins
functional replication cycle. encouraging findings for
vaccine drug design, could consider newly established genetic
diversity profiles.
