objectives: compare language development infants young children with
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection language development children 
who exposed hiv uninfected, (among subjects hiv
infection) compare language development cognitive neurologic status.
design: prospective evaluation language development infected exposed
but uninfected infants young children.
setting: pediatric infectious disease clinic, state university new york-health
science center syracuse.
subjects: nine infants young children infected hiv 69 seropositive
but uninfected infants children, age 6 weeks 45 months.
results: mean early language milestone scale, 2nd edition (elm-2) global language
scores significantly lower subjects hiv infection, compared with
uninfected subjects (89.3 vs 96.2, mann-whitney u test). proportion of
subjects scoring >2 sd mean elm-2 least one occasion also 
was significantly greater subjects hiv infection, compared with
uninfected subjects (4 9 infected subjects, 5 69 uninfected
subjects; fisher's exact test). seven 9 subjects hiv infection
manifested deterioration language function. four manifested unremitting
deterioration; 1 4 demonstrated unequivocal abnormality on
neurologic examination. three subjects hiv infection language
deterioration showed improvement language almost immediately the
initiation antiretroviral drug treatment. magnetic resonance imaging or
computed tomography brain performed 6 7 infected subjects 
language deterioration, findings normal 6. elm-2 global language 
scaled scores showed good agreement bayley mental developmental index or
the mccarthy global cognitive index (r = 0. 70). language deterioration, or
improvement language initiation drug therapy, coincided or
preceded changes global cognitive function, times intervals 12 
months.
conclusions: language deterioration occurs commonly infants young children
with hiv infection, seen frequently absence abnormalities on
neurologic examination central nervous system imaging, may precede
evidence deterioration global cognitive ability. periodic assessment of
language development added developmental monitoring infants
and young children hiv infection means monitoring disease
progression efficacy drug treatment.
