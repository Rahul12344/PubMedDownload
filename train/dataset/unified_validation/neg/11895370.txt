the choroid plexus contains major reservoir macrophages poised efficient
delivery virus neurotoxins brain infection lentiviruses
such human feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv). however, contribution
to neurotoxicity poorly understood. medium fiv-infected, choroid plexus
macrophages applied cultured feline cortical neurons induced small acute
calcium rise followed either delayed calcium deregulation (41%) swelling 
and bursting (23%). nmda glutamate receptor blockade prevented acute calcium 
increase antagonists ip(3) receptor, voltage-gated calcium channels
and sodium channels suppressed acute late increases. analysis of
intracellular calcium recovery toxin-treated neurons brief exposure to
glutamate, revealed decrease rate extent recovery. apparent
diverse pharmacological contributions intracellular calcium destabilization
may due ability macrophage toxins interfere recovery of
intracellular calcium homeostasis.
