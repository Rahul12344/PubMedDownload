the expression cytokines may influence development lymphoma in
retrovirally infected animals least two ways: (1) cytokines tumor
environment may stimulate proliferation tumor cells and/or (2) cytokines
in tumor environment may diminish cell-mediated antitumor immune
response. evaluate possibilities, semiquantitative rt-pcr approach was
utilized permit broad screening cytokine mrnas large number of
tissue samples. examination mulv-induced end-stage lymphomas revealed the
absence mrna cytokines known stimulate proliferation cells
(i.e., il-2, il-9), absence mrna cytokines known enhance
cell-mediated antitumor immune responses (i.e., il-2, ifngamma), presence
of mrna cytokines known diminish responses (i.e., il-4, il-10).
similar patterns cytokine mrna expression detected tumor-derived cell 
lines. spleen thymus animals collected longitudinally infection
and age-matched uninfected mice also demonstrated similar pattern, except 
that ifngamma mrna readily detectable. findings support the
hypothesis developing tumor depends cytokines provide
proliferative signals. findings suggest cytokines immediate
environment lymphoma support tumor development acting diminish an
effective antitumor immune response.
