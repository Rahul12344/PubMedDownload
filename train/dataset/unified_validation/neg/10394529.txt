purpose: sperm cells shown take exogenous dna readily. the
hypothesis sperm washing would remove exogenous viral dna infecting
sperm cells. objective compare three types sperm washing procedures
for capacity remove exogenous human papillomavirus (hpv) dna from
infected sperm.
methods: prewashed sperm equally divided sperm one portion were
exposed l1 hpv dna fragments 30 min 37 degrees c. untreated washed
sperm served control. transfection, sperm washed either 
centrifuge, two-layer isolate colloid wash, test-yolk buffer procedures. sperm
parameters measured hamilton thorn htm-c analyzer. sperm dna were
extracted polymerase chain reaction (pcr) carried targeting l1
consensus gene hpv designated sentinel gene, 17q21 spanning the
d17s855 gene. amplified products analyzed 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.
results: pcr analyses detected consensus l1 hpv gene sperm were
processed either three procedures. controls negative 
l1 gene. extracted dna verified pcr amplification 17q21 spanning the
d17s855 gene. transfected sperm higher percentages total motility and
progression compared control. centrifuged, washed, transfected sperm
exhibited greater curvilinear velocity hyperactivation.
conclusions: data showed washing would remove exogenous hpv dna from
sperm cells. viral dna tenaciously bound sperm, suggesting an
internalization sperm. viral dna also increased motility 
sperm affecting velocity progression sperm, suggested
either increase metabolism, enhancement calcium-regulated
motility mechanism, artifact pcr reagents. studies needed to
elucidate mechanism dna stimulated sperm motility.
