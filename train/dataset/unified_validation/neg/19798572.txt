background: jc virus (jcv), polyoma virus, etiological agent of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy immunosuppressed patients. jcv t-ag
has proven oncogenic potential expressed colonic polyps carcinomas.
we proposed prevalence jcv t-ag dna higher normal
gastrointestinal (gi) mucosa immunosuppressed patients compared their
immunocompetent counterparts.
aims: look jcv t-ag dna normal gastrointestinal mucosa of
immunosuppressed patients compared immunocompetent controls.
methods: macroscopically normal samples upper lower gi mucosa were
obtained 38 immunosuppressed patients. control group included samples from
19 immunocompetent inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) 29 non-ibd cases. dna was
extracted polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed using primers
specific t-ag.
results: jcv t-ag dna found nine immunosuppressed patients (23.7%) 
and three controls (6.3%; p = 0.02). transplant recipients a
particularly high prevalence jcv t-ag dna (35.3%). patients ibd receiving
immunosuppressive drugs higher prevalence jcv t-ag dna comparison
with ibd patients receive immunosuppression (22.2% versus 10.5%,
respectively), difference statistically significant (p = 0.574).
conclusion: jcv t-ag dna prevalent upper lower gi mucosa of
immunosuppressed patients, possibly indicating virus resides these
patients. may account higher prevalence gi carcinomas in
immunosuppressed patients.
