ranaviruses serious pathogens fish, amphibians, reptiles, pose a
major threat global biodiversity. ranavirus isolated tissues of
diseased tadpoles frogs gangwon province, korea, 2006 2007, was
designated korean ranavirus-1 (krv-1) infectious variety fish
cell lines highest titers (10(10)tcid(50)/ml) epithelioma papulosum
cyprini cells (epcs) baby hamster kidney-21 (bhk-21) cells. bullfrog (rana
catesbeiana) tadpoles challenged immersion 10(5)tcid(50)/ml krv-1 showed
60% mortality within 10 days. sds-page frog virus 3 (fv3) krv-1 proteins
yielded several bands 35-49kda size, identified major capsid
proteins (mcps) maldi-tof ms. immunoblotting fv3 proteins showed antigenic 
bands 34kda 93kda size identified maldi-tof/tof ms mcp
and neurofilament triplet h1-like protein (nf-h1), respectively. krv-1,
antigenic bands 32kda, 69kda, 72kda identified mcp, hypothetical
protein, nf-h1, respectively. genes encoding krv-1 proteins were
sequenced. krv-1 appeared closely related soft-shelled turtle
iridovirus (stiv), based alignments amino acid sequences various
ranaviruses. variability ranavirus antigenic proteins apparent an
earlier study. expected use methods employed here, together
with results present work, contribute understanding 
pathogenesis ranaviruses, development dna- or
protein-based bait vaccines conservation natural habitats.
