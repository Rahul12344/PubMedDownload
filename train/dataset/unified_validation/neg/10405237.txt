the significance repeatedly normal serum aminotransferase activities in
antihepatitis c virus (anti-hcv)-positive patients clear. address 
issue, authors analyzed clinical, virologic, histopathologic, biological 
characteristics subjects. among active file 1,200
anti-hcv-positive immunocompetent patients, identified 36 subjects (3%) with
repeatedly normal aminotransferase activities, defined least four normal
values aminotransferase minimum period 6 months without abnormal
value (mean period, 31 +/- 21 months). 36 patients included 11 men
and 25 women mean age 45 +/- 15 years. twenty-three 36
subjects (64%) detectable hcv viremia polymerase chain reaction. their
genotype distribution follows: genotype 1a 1b, 57%; genotype 2, 26%;
and genotype 3, 17%. hcv ribonucleic acid (rna)-positive hcv
rna-negative subjects, 17 5 liver biopsy respectively. former,
the mean knodell score 5.6 +/- 3.5 (range, 1 14), < 5 9
patients (53%) > = 5 8 (47%), including extensive fibrosis (n = 2) or
cirrhosis (n = 2). hcv rna-negative subjects, one patient knodell
score > = 5. comparing 23 immunocompetent viremic subjects repeatedly
normal serum aminotransferase activities group (n = 564) of
immunocompetent viremic patients abnormal aminotransferase activities, there
was significant predominance women (70% versus 44%, p < 0.05) of
genotype 2 former (26% versus 7%, p < 0.05), differences according 
to quantitative viremia, alcohol consumption, distribution risk factor were
observed. viremic hcv-infected patients long-term repeatedly
normal aminotransferase values indeed chronic active hepatitis, including
extensive fibrosis cirrhosis many 20% patients. emphasizes
the need serum hcv rna determination anti-hcv-positive patients with
normal aminotransferase activities. patients liver biopsy may be
necessary discussed.
