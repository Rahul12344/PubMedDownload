carnosine (β-alanyl-l-histidine) small dipeptide numerous activities,
including antioxidant effects, metal ion chelation, proton buffering capacity,
and inhibitory effects protein carbonylation glycation. carnosine been
mostly studied organs abundant, including skeletal muscle,
cerebral cortex, kidney, spleen, plasma. recently, effect of
supplementation carnosine studied organs low levels of
carnosine, lung, animal models influenza virus or
lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury pulmonary fibrosis. among the
known protective effects carnosine, antioxidant effect attracted
increasing attention potential use treating lung disease. review, 
we describe vitro vivo biological physiological actions of
carnosine. also report recent study discuss roles carnosine 
its related compounds organs carnosine present small amounts 
(especially lung) protective mechanisms.
