the triple gene block protein 2 (tgbp2) bamboo mosaic virus (bamv) a
transmembrane protein known required cell-to-cell movement
of potexviruses. protein two conserved cys residues, cys-109 and
cys-112, c-terminal tail, supposed exposed outer
surface endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane er-derived granular
vesicles. study, investigated importance two cys residues
on cell-to-cell systemic movement bamv. results indicate 
cys-to-ala substitutions tgbp2 make cell-to-cell movement bamv
relatively inefficient systemic movement bamv severely inhibited.
moreover, defect systemic movement attributed inefficient
transport viral rna phloem petiole. clearly, tgbp2 critical not
only cell-to-cell also systemic movement bamv. in
addition, conserved cys residues important functioning tgbp2.
