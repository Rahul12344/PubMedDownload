environmental factors play important role pathophysiology of
inflammatory bowel disease. strong consistent association 
smoking crohn's disease, nonsmoking ulcerative colitis.
despite extensive research, exact pathophysiological mechanisms these
associations remain unclear. spite this, clinical trials with
nicotine-patches showed beneficial effects treatment ulcerative
colitis. associations crohn's disease ulcerative colitis other
environmental factors weaker like association use oral
contraceptives less well investigated association with
childhood hygiene. studies suggesting potential pathogenetic role of
mycobacterium paratuberculosis effect tuberculostatic therapy crohn's
disease could reproduced others. perinatal childhood infections by
viruses like measles heavily debated, proven causal for
inflammatory bowel disease. coagulation disorders described as
protecting inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting hypercoagulability a
pathogenetic factor. studies described appendectomy may prevent the
onset ulcerative colitis man mice. environmental factors 
hydrogen sulfide, tonsillectomy, diet, blood transfusions, listeria also
require confirmation. are, however, convincing data genetic animal
models twin studies environmental factors intestinal bacterial
flora interact susceptible hosts cause inflammatory bowel disease.
inflammatory bowel diseases multifactorial etiologies, require a
differentiated approach treatment prevention.
