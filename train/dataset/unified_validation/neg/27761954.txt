in compromised neuronal health. viral protein hiv-1 transactivator of

patients even cases viral load non-detectable due successful haart
therapy. recently, demonstrated hiv-1 tat triggers excess atp release
from astrocytes causes neuronal death activating purinergic receptor
system. using well-characterized model system human primary astrocytes and
