recombinant chimeric protein c2 containing n-terminal region trpe (37
kilodaltons [kda]) c-terminal half (46.8 kda) polypeptide encoded 
by orf2 hepatitis e virus (hev) genome used construction 
western blot diagnostic test igg igm antibodies virus (anti-hev). 
(the c2 protein trpe protein devoid c2 activity used control 
for non-specific reactions purified recovery sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [sds-page] used preparation of
strips). specificity test proven sera obtained patients with
acute hepatitis non-a, non-b, non-c (nanbnc) outbreaks different
geographic regions world. igg antibodies reactive recombinant c2
protein detected 93% patients acute hepatitis nanbnc remained
detectable 89-100% patients 1-24 months onset jaundice. igm 
antibodies detected 73% patients within 26 days onset of
jaundice, 50% 1-4 months onset, 6% 6-7 months onset, 
patients 8 months onset. test used identify sporadic
hepatitis e cases different regions world, cases found almost
exclusively areas outbreaks disease occurred rarely in
any regions.
