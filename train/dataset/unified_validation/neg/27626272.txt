our study demonstrates repeated isolation vaccine-derived newcastle
disease viruses different species wild birds across four continents 
1997 2014. data indicate least 17 species ten avian
orders occupying different habitats excrete vaccine-derived newcastle disease
viruses. frequently reported isolates detected among individuals in
the order columbiformes (n = 23), followed frequency order anseriformes
(n = 13). samples isolated free-ranging (n = 47) wild birds
kept captivity (n = 7). number recovered vaccine-derived viruses
corresponded widely utilized vaccines, lasota (n = 28) hitchner
b1 (n = 19). detected vaccine-derived viruses resembled phy-lmv2 v4
vaccines, five two cases, respectively. results ubiquitous
and synanthropic nature wild pigeons highlight potential role as
indicator species presence newcastle disease virus low virulence in
the environment. reverse spillover live agents domestic animals to
wildlife result expansion livestock industries employing massive
amounts live virus vaccines represent underappreciated poorly studied
effect human activity wildlife.
