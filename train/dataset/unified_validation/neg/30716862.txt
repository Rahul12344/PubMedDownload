plants single field commercial tomato (solanum lycopersicum) of
unidentified cultivars virginia july, 2012, observed showing stunting,
leaf distortion, twisting thickening, discoloration, color streaking 
ringspots fruits. serological tests negative cucumber mosaic virus,
groundnut ringspot virus, tomato spotted wilt virus, tomato chlorotic spot virus,
impatiens necrotic spot virus, tobacco mosaic virus, tomato bushy stunt virus
(agdia, inc., elkhart, in). using membrane-based macroarray (3), hybridization 
was observed 8 9 70-mer oligonucleotide probes spinach latent virus
(splv; genus ilarvirus, family bromoviridae). confirm hybridization
results, complementary dna (cdna) synthesized using random hexamers mmlv 
reverse transcriptase (promega, madison, wi), followed pcr amplification using
ilarvirus degenerate primers (4). fragments approximately 380 bp were
amplified directly sequenced (genbank accession kc_466090); blast search
showed 99% identity splv rna 2 reference genome (nc_003809). primers for
splv rna1 (splvrna1f-ggtgtcaccatgcaaactgg, splvrna1r-agctcttcgtaataggcctgc) and
splv rna3 (splvcpf-gaagtctttcccaggtgagca, splvcpr-aggtgggcatatggacttgg) were
designed cdna amplified using iq supermix (biorad, hercules, ca) with
thermocycling 94°c 4 min, 35× (94°c 45 s, 55°c 45 s, 72°c 45 s), 72°c 
for 10 min. resulting fragments 538 bp rna1 (kc_466088) 661 bp for
rna3 (kc_466089) showed 100% identity reference genome sequences splv
(nc_003808 nc_003810, respectively). demonstrate virus transmissibility,
chenopodium quinoa plants mechanically inoculated using tomato leaf material
(same source described above) ground 30 mm na2hpo4 buffer, ph 7.0. necrotic
spots developed inoculated leaves 10 dpi. younger, non-inoculated leaves
showed yellow mottling tested positive splv rt-pcr (two two plants 
tested). detection splv rarely reported, one record 
united states (2). although splv described latent virus, been
found associated tomato fruit symptoms new zealand (1). known
if fruit ringspot symptoms virginia samples due to
virus infection. since splv seed-transmissible seed production takes place
in different parts world, potential spread germplasm
and become widespread north america. references: (1) b. s. m. lebas et
