accumulated sequence analyses antibody repertoire revealed 
autoantibodies developmentally regulated antibodies share small set of
germline ig-variable region (v) genes. findings prompted speculation
that certain autoantibodies developmental importance may be
instrumental maintaining homeostasis adult antibody repertoire. in
order evaluate hypothesis critically, first necessary determine 
the v gene usage human antibodies foreign substances. unfortunately,
only antibodies heavy light chains characterized.
to rectify situation, adapted anchored polymerase chain reaction to
clone analyze rapidly expressed v genes three anti-virus igg
antibodies. results show three heavy chain v (vh) genes highly
homologous known autoantibody-related vh genes. contrast, two light
chain v (vl) genes v lambda 1 subgroup similar a
non-autoantibody-related germline v lambda 1 gene. taken together the
reported vh vl sequences several antibodies viruses bacteria, 
the data show many antipathogen antibodies may use small set vh 
genes encode autoantibodies, diverse vl genes distinct from
autoantibody-related vl genes. thus, small portion potentially
functional germline vh genes used recurrently generate antibodies 
a normal antibody repertoire, regardless reactivities either self
or non-self.
