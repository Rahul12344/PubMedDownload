in early 2013, greenhouse cucumber growers alberta, canada, observed
virus-like disease symptoms mini-cucumber (cucumis sativus) crops (e.g.,
'picowell'). two types symptoms commonly observed, green mottle mosaic
and necrotic spots. early infection, young leaves infected cucumber
plants displayed light green mottle blisters. infected plants were
stunted growth, darker green blisters green mottle mosaic symptoms on
mature leaves. disease incidence varied one greenhouse another. some
severe cases, diseased plants widely distributed inside greenhouse,
resulting 10 15% yield losses based grower's estimation. nine
symptomatic samples collected subjected total rna isolation using the
trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). laboratory analyses conducted
using real-time rt-pcr systems cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (cgmmv)
(1), melon necrotic spot virus (mnsv, ling, unpublished), squash mosaic virus
(sqmv) (3). nine samples positive cgmmv seven in
mixed infections mnsv. two samples selected validation the
presence cgmmv using conventional rt-pcr (2) new primer set (cgmmvmp
f1: 5'-atgtctctaagtaaggtgtc-3' cgmmv3'utr r1: 5'-tgggcccctacccgggg-3') and
two previous online published primer sets, one cgmmv mp (5'
taagtttgctaggtgtgatc-3', genbank accession no. aj250104 5'
acatagatgtctctaagtaag-3', aj250105), another cgmmv cp (5'
accctcgaaactaagctttc-3', aj243351 5' gaagagtccagttctgtttc-3', aj243352). 
expected sizes rt-pcr products obtained sequenced directly. sequences
from three products overlapped generated 1,282-bp contig (kf683202). 
blastn analysis ncbi database showed 99% sequence identity cgmmv
isolates identified asia, including china (gq277655, kc852074), india
(dq767631), korea (af417243), myanmar (ab510355), taiwan (hq692886), only
92% sequence identity cgmmv isolates identified europe, including
spain (gq411361) russia (gq495274), 95% cgmmv isolate israel
(kf155231). strong sequence identity cgmmv asian isolates suggests
that canadian cgmmv isolate identified alberta likely asian origin.
in two bioassay experiments using one sample prepared 0.01 phosphate buffer,
the similar green mottle mosaic symptoms observed systemic leaves 
mechanically inoculated plants presence cgmmv, mnsv, was
confirmed real-time rt-pcr four different cucurbits, including three
cucumis sativus cultivars (six plants 'marketer,' five plants 'poinsett
76,' six plants 'straight 8'), seven plants c. melo 'athena,' six plants of
c. metulifer (pi201681), two plants citrullus lanatus 'charleston gray.'
to knowledge, cgmmv reported asia, europe, middle
east, first report cgmmv american continents. cgmmv 
highly contagious seed borne cucurbits. increasing trend in
growing grafted watermelon cucurbits united states and
elsewhere, even important vigilant seed health test program
for cgmmv implemented. references: (1) h. chen et al. j. virol. methods
