suspension.

optical indicators cationic, cyanine anionic oxonol classes used 
to evaluate plasma membrane potential animal cells suspension in
monolayer culture. optical signals calibrated using diffusion
potentials either k+ (in presence valinomycin) h+ (in the
presence carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; fccp); both
classes dye gave similar values plasma membrane potential, range -40
to -90 mv different cell types. addition haemolytic sendai virus or
staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin depolarizes cells causes leak
monovalent cations; effects antagonized extracellular ca2+. cells
infected vesicular stomatitis semliki forest virus become depolarized
during infectious cycle; infection viruses without affect on
plasma membrane potential.
