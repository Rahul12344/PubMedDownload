three interferon-inducible mx genes identified rainbow trout
oncorhynchus mykiss roles virus resistance yet be
determined. mice, expression mx1 protein associated resistance 
to influenza virus. report study determine whether a
correlation expression mx rainbow trout resistance a
fish rhabdovirus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihnv). comparison of
mx mrna expression made different families cultured rainbow trout 
selected resistance susceptibility ihnv. trout-specific mx cdna
gene probe used determine whether correlation mx mrna 
expression resistance lethal effects ihnv infection. approximately 
99% trout injected highly virulent strain fish rhabdovirus,
ihnv, able express full length mx mrna 48 h post infection. is
markedly different expression truncated, non-functional mx mrna found
in laboratory strains mice, ability 25% wild mice to
express functional mx protein. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) 
assay developed compare mx locus individual fish between
rainbow trout genetic crosses bred ihnv resistance susceptibility. the
assay able discriminate 7 distinct rflp patterns rainbow trout
crosses. one cross identified showed correlation homozygosity 
at mx locus greater susceptibility ihn-caused mortality.
