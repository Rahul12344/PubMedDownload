we established lymphoid cell lines diversity immunoglobulin
expression infection bone marrow cells four patients congenital
agammaglobulinemia epstein-barr virus. immunofluorescent study revealed that
the cells many lymphoid cell lines characteristics possible
precursor b cells, permitting classification follows: 1) cell lines without
any surface cytoplasmic immunoglobulins (17/28 lines), 2) cell lines had
only cytoplasmic mu heavy chains (line k4 o2), 3) cell lines mu and
delta heavy chains cytoplasm (line o6 m5), 4) cell lines bore
surface mu chains possessed cytoplasmic mu chains lacked light chain
expression (line s5), 5) cell lines surface cytoplasmic delta and
lambda chains, secreted immunoglobulins (line k5), 6) cell lines
which surface igm cytoplasmic mu light chains, secreted the
immunoglobulins (5/28 lines). biosynthetic studies 14c-leucine confirmed the
patterns immunoglobulin expression found immunofluorescent analysis. 
cell lines may represent stages b cell development provide useful
information pathophysiology congenital agammaglobulinemia.
