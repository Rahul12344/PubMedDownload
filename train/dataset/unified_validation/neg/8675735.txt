aims: investigate impact hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection long term
survivors haematological malignancy treated introduction blood
donor screening september 1991.
method: patients tested evidence hcv infection third generation
enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, recombinant immunoblot assay reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. serum aspartate aminotransferase
activities measured. number type blood component units received
by patient recorded.
results: forty two patients studied received total 7143 blood
component units. two patients (4.8%) found hcv infection, had
histological evidence chronic active hepatitis, one receiving
treatment alpha-interferon. patients missed the
ongoing look-back programme aims detect recipients known hcv
infected blood components.
conclusion: although hcv infection affects minority long term survivors of
haematological malignancy, infected patients may benefit alpha-interferon
treatment. screening patients treated haematological malignancy
before september 1991 advocated.
