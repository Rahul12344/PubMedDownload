sting (also known mita) mediates innate antiviral signaling and
ubiquitination sting key function. however, deubiquitination

deconjugate k48-linked ubiquitination chains sting promotes the

resulted enhanced k48-linked ubiquitination accelerated degradation of
sting, impaired activation irf3 nf-Îºb well induction of
downstream genes infection dna virus hsv-1 transfection various 
dna ligands. addition, usp18-/- mice susceptible hsv-1 infection 
compared wild-type littermates. usp18 deubiquitinate sting in

independent enzymatic activity usp18. addition, reconstitution of
sting usp18-/- mefs restored hsv-1-induced expression downstream genes
and cellular antiviral responses. findings thus uncover previously
uncharacterized roles usp18 usp20 mediating virus-triggered signaling
and contribute understanding complicated regulatory system the
