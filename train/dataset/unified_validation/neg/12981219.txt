rabbits inoculated c.p.m. strain myxoma virus resulting 
subcutaneous tumors fixed, embedded, sectioned observation 
electron microscope. round cells typical stellate myxomatous cells
were observed addition changes collagen pattern intercellular
spaces. cytoplasm cells showed great number bodies varying
size density, largest size characteristics
of elementary bodies virus. bodies showed internal
structure, formed tight clumping small dense particles.
distribution curves diameter elementary bodies smaller
internal particles presented. morphological problems involved the
virus-host cell relationship discussed case myxoma virus.
