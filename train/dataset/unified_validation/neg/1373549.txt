synthetic peptides anti-peptide antibodies widely used probes to
map b- t-cell epitopes proteins. probes also potential to
delineate contact sites involved generally protein-protein interactions 
association domains within protein. applied peptide/anti-peptide probes
to define: (1) regions human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
envelope glycoproteins gp120 gp41 involved association these
two glycoproteins; (2) sites gp120/gp41, essential association 
hiv-1 cd4 cell receptor. results examination suggested the
following: (1) two segments gp120, encompassing residues (102-126) and
(425-452), contribute binding site cd4 expected be
juxtaposed folded gp120 chain; (2) portions immunodominant gp120 and
gp41 epitopes, encompassing residues (303-338) (579-611), respectively,
appeared involved gp120-gp41 association, suggested direct
binding studies limited accessibility epitopes hiv-1
virions: portions gp120 also appeared contribute association
between two glycoproteins; (3) partial overlap gp41 
cd4 binding sites gp120; (4) fusion domain segment (637-666) gp41
are accessible antibodies oligomerization gp41; 5) the
gp120-gp41 association blocked aurintricarboxylic acid, suggesting the
possibility developing antiviral compounds interfering hiv-1 assembly.
