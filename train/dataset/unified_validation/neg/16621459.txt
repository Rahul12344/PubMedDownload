a series 42 lipophilic bromovinyldeoxyuridine monophosphates (bvdumps) are
presented potential prodrugs antiviral agent
(e)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (bvdu). 5'-cyclosal-masking group
technique applied cyclic nucleoside analogue achieve delivery
of monophosphate bvdu inside target cells. new substances have
been tested antiviral activity herpes simplex virus types 1 and
2 (hsv-1 -2), thymidine kinase-deficient (tk(-)) hsv-1, varicella-zoster
virus (vzv), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) epstein-barr virus (ebv). the
xtt-based tetrazolium reduction assay ez4u (for hsv), plaque inhibition test 
(for vzv hcmv) dna hybridisation assay (for ebv) used assess
antiviral activity. results indicate cyclosal-bvdump triesters proved to
be potent selective inhibitors hsv-1 comparable aciclovir. vzv
replication inhibited low concentrations, two substances a
slightly better anti-vzv activity parent compound bvdu. antiviral
effect could demonstrated tk(-)-hsv-1, hsv-2 hcmv, likely
owing lack phosphorylation bvdu diphosphate. remarkably,
several cyclosal-bvdump triesters yielded promising anti-ebv activity whereas the
parent compound bvdu entirely inactive.
