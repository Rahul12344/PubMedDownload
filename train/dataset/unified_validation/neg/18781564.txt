epstein barr virus (ebv) causes lymphomas immune competent and, increased
frequencies, immune compromised patients. presence intact immune 
system, ebv-associated lymphomas express cases 3 fewer ebv
antigens protein level, always including nuclear antigen 1 ebv
(ebna1). ebna1 prominent target ebv-specific cd4(+) cell humoral
immune responses healthy ebv carriers. demonstrate patients 
ebv-associated lymphomas, primarily hodgkin's lymphoma, lack detectable
ebna1-specific cd4(+) t-cell responses slightly altered ebna1-specific
antibody titers diagnosis. contrast, majority ebv-negative lymphoma 
patients detectable ifn-gamma expression proliferation cd4(+) cells 
in response ebna1, carry ebna1-specific immunoglobulins levels similar 
to healthy virus carriers. ebv antigens, present the
tumors, recognized less ebv positive, negative lymphoma patients,
but detectable responses reached similar cd8(+) cell frequencies both
cohorts. patients ebv-positive -negative lymphomas differ in
t-cell responses influenza-specific cd4(+) cell proliferation in
antibody titers tetanus toxoid. data suggest selective loss of
ebna1-specific immune control ebv-associated lymphoma patients, should
be targeted immunotherapy malignancies.
