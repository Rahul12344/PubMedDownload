dengue virus (denv), member genus flavivirus within family
flaviviridae, one significant mosquito-borne viruses causing 
dengue fever human. rapid diagnostic would helpful detect denv
infection timely manner. last decade, recombinase polymerase
amplification (rpa) technique experiencing rapid development widely 
employed detect various pathogens. present study, reverse
transcription rpa (rt-rpa) assay combined lateral flow dipstick (lfd) was
established rapid detection denv. assay could detect denv-1, -2, -3
and -4. minimal detection limit rt-rpa-lfd assay 10 copies rna
molecules. assay denv-specific since non-specific reactions
with common human pathogens. clinical performance rt-rpa assay
was validated using 120 clinical samples. coincidence rate rt-rpa-lfd
and qrt-pcr clinical samples 100%, indicating rt-rpa-lfd assay
had good diagnostic performance clinical samples. rt-rpa-lfd assay
required sophisticated instrument, providing possible solution denv
diagnosis recourse-limited settings denv infection epidemic.
