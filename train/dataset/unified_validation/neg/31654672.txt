we recently shown artemisinin derivative artemisone, was
screened malaria human clinical studies, potent inhibitor of
human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). evaluated antiviral effect of
artemisone employed 2-drug combinations approved experimental
anti-hcmv agents. using chou-talalay method, found in-vitro
combination artemisone cidofovir, brincidofovir, hcmv ul97
inhibitor maribavir resulted antiviral synergism combination of
artemisone ganciclovir viral terminase inhibitors letermovir and
bdcrb resulted moderate synergism. importantly, combination artemisone 
with maribavir demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity ex-vivo, a
clinically-relevant multicellular model human placental tissues maintained 
organ culture. findings provide basis use artemisone in
synergistically acting drug combinations, enhance viral control reduce
antiviral drug toxicities.
