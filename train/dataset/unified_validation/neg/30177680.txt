osteopontin (opn) involved cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, and
tumor progression various tissues. opn induces stemness interacting with
cd44, functional relevance opn-mediated interferon (ifn) signaling and
hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication stem cell populations remains unclear. 
this study, investigated effect opn hcv replication ifn
signaling cancer stem cells (cscs) positive epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (epcam) cd44. show epcam+/cd44+ cscs show marked hcv
replication compared epcam-/cd44- cells. addition, opn significantly
enhances hcv replication epcam+/cd44+ cscs markedly suppresses
ifn-stimulated gene expression. gsk-3Î² inhibitor bio increases the
epcam+/cd44+ csc population opn expression impairs ifn signaling via
stat1 degradation. taken together, data suggest opn enhances hcv
replication epcam+/cd44+ cscs, also negatively regulates ifn 
signaling pathway via inhibition stat1 phosphorylation degradation.
therefore, opn may represent novel therapeutic target treating hcv-related 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
