in study, engineered non-viral polymer based delivery systems with
structural features mimicking viral vectors developed the
potential carrier sirna delivery assessed. developed sirna
carrier based poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
(peo-b-pcl) micelles decorated integrin alphavbeta3 targeting peptide
(rgd4c) and/or cell penetrating peptide (tat) peo shell, modified with
a polycation (spermine) pcl core sirna binding protection. we
observed increased cellular uptake effective endosomal escape sirna
delivered peptide-functionalized micelles especially dual
functionality (rgd/tat-micelles) compared unmodified micelles (non-micelles)
in mda435/lcc6 resistant cells. transfection mdr1 sirna formulated in
peptide-modified micelles led p-gp regulation mrna and
protein level. subsequent p-gp regulation, increased cellular
accumulation p-gp substrate, doxorubicin (dox), cytoplasm nucleus
of resistant mda435/lcc6 cells treatment peptide decorated polymeric
micelle/mdr1 sirna complexes observed. result, resistance dox was
successfully reversed. interestingly, rgd/tat-micellar sirna complexes produced
improved cellular uptake, p-gp silencing, dox cellular accumulation, dox nuclear 
localization dox induced cytotoxicity mda435/lcc6 cells compared to
micelles decorated individual peptides. results study indicated a
potential rgd/tat-functionalized virus-like micelles promising carriers
for efficient delivery mdr1 sirna mda435/lcc6 resistant cells means to
reverse p-gp mediated multidrug resistance dox.
