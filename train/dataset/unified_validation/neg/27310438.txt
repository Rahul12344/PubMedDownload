background: preterm infants high risk developing respiratory syncytial 
virus (rsv)-associated lower respiratory tract infection (lrti). this
observational epidemiologic study evaluated rsv disease burden risk factors
for rsv-associated lrti hospitalization preterm infants 33 weeks+0 days 35 
weeks+6 days gestational age receiving rsv prophylaxis.
methods: preterm infants ≤6 months age rsv season (1 october 2013-30
april 2014) followed 72 sites across 23 countries september
2013-july 2014 (study period). rsv testing performed according local
clinical practice. factors related rsv-associated hospitalization lrti
were identified using multivariable logistic regression backward selection.
results: 2390 evaluable infants, 204 127 hospitalized lrti
during study period rsv season, respectively. among subjects,
64/204 46/127, respectively, hospitalized confirmed rsv lrti. study 
period rsv season normalized rsv hospitalization rates (per 100 infant years)
were 4.1 6.1, respectively. factors associated increased risk of
rsv-related lrti hospitalization multivariable analyses smoking family
members (p<0.0001), non-hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
diagnosis (p = 0.0077), maternal age ≤25 years delivery (p = 0.0009), low
maternal educational level (p = 0.0426), household presence children aged 4 to
5 years (p = 0.0038), age 1 october ≤3 months (p = 0.0422), presence of
paternal atopy (p<0.0001).
conclusions: 2013-2014 rsv season across 23 countries, preterm
infants 33-35 weeks gestation ≤6 months old 1 october receiving rsv
prophylaxis, confirmed rsv lrti hospitalization incidence 4.1 per 100 infant 
years study period 6.1 per 100 infant years rsv season.
this study enhances findings single-country studies common risk factors
for severe rsv infection preterm infants suggests combinations 4-6
risk factors may used accurately predict risk rsv hospitalization. these
findings may useful identification infants risk severe
rsv infection.
