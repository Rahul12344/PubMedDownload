haemolysis observed frequently complication acute hepatitis a
virus (hav) infection. however, pathogenic mechanism elucidated 
completely. individual cases detection anti-erythrocyte antibodies of
unknown specificity described. raised serum igm fraction shown to
consist partially autoantibodies. previously, detected autoantibodies of
immunoglobulin class directed triosephosphate isomerase (igm anti-tpi) 
in patients infectious mononucleosis. autoantibodies able to
induce haemolysis. study occurrence igm anti-tpi acute hav
infections viral diseases investigated. 33 134 patients 
suffering hav infection (igm anti-tpi detected. haematological and
chemical data available seven 33 patients. mild-to-moderate
signs haemolysis correlating igm anti-tpi titre follow-up
examinations demonstrated. presence igm anti-tpi hav infections is
connected reactivation latent persistent ebv infection. other
viral infections detection igm anti-tpi evidence reactivated
ebv infection rare. thus, anticipate igm anti-tpi antibodies occurring
with reactivation latent persistent ebv infection take part provoking
haemolysis acute hav infections.
