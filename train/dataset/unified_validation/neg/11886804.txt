we previously found 14-amino acid residue-peptide, t140, inhibits
infection target cells cell line-tropic hiv-1 (x4-hiv-1) its
specific binding chemokine receptor, cxcr4. here, importance an
l-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine (nal) residue position 3 t140 high anti-hiv
activity inhibitory activity ca(2+) mobilization induced stromal
cell-derived factor (sdf)-1alpha-stimulation cxcr4 initially been
shown synthesis biological evaluation several analogues, where
nal(3) substituted diverse aromatic amino acids. next, order the
n-terminal 3 residues (arg(1)-arg(2)-nal(3)) proved important from
the structure--activity relationship (sar) study shuffling residues. based 
on results, found 10-residue peptides possessing modest anti-hiv
activity systematic antiviral evaluation series synthetic, shortened
analogues t140.
