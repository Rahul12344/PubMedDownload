indole derivatives inhibit hepatitis c virus replication induction of
pro-inflammatory cytokines.

lee s, jin g, kim d, son s, lee k, lee c.

previously, discovered series indole derivatives new class of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication inhibitors using target-free chemical
genetic strategy. structure-activity relationship study, compound
12e identified potent inhibitor class (ec50 = 1.1 μmol/l)
with minimal cytotoxicity (cc50 = 61.8 μmol/l). order gain insight its
detailed antiviral mechanism action, performed pcr array analyses found
that 12e able activate transcription number pro-inflammatory as
well antiviral cytokine genes including cxcl-8, il-1α, tnf-α, il-3, irak-1,
and ddx58. induction 12e verified individual rt-pcr analyses. 
addition, 12e found stimulate secretion soluble factors anti-hcv
replication activity. among 12e-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, cxcl-8
showed strong positive correlation transcriptional activation and
antiviral potency. interestingly, recombinant cxcl-8 protein also reduced hcv
replication, though moderately. conclusion, found novel mode of
action indole derivatives inhibiting hcv replication, particularly the
induction pro-inflammatory cytokines.
