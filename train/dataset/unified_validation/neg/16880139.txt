viral quantification viral load testing become part routine
management patients infected hiv-1 hepatitis c virus (hcv). 
currently several molecular technologies available use the
clinical laboratory setting. these, branched dna (bdna) assays are
fda-approved hiv-1 hcv viral load testing. signal amplification
technology built series hybridization reactions highly
amenable full automation thus lessen amount labor required to
perform type analysis. article provides historical perspective 
bdna clinical applications.
