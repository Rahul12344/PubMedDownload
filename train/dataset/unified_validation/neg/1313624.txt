the antibody response cattle vaccination foot-and-mouth disease 
(fmd) virus monitored using serum neutralization test (snt), sandwich
elisa, liquid-phase elisa, sandwich competition elisa, liquid-phase competition
elisa, liquid-phase sandwich competition (blocking) elisa. the
competition elisas (in particular "blocking" elisa) effective
at detecting reactivity cattle sera. however, 95% negative sera also 
competed sensitive elisa (the "blocking" elisa) titres 1:32 (4%
of sera competed titre 1:128). comparisons different
elisas, elisas snt, demonstrated tests were
not measuring exactly reaction antibody fmd virus. respect 
to capacity animals resist fmd virus challenge, neither snt the
competition elisas consistently able identify animals. anti-fmd 
virus antibody titres obtained could classified three zones; "white
zone" wherein antibody titres high donor animals likely protected;
the "black zone" wherein antibody titres low donor animals likely 
susceptible infection; "grey zone" wherein antibody titres were
intermediary interpretation could made respect protection.
assays elisa snt cannot measure immunological protection; 
they measure antibody responses nothing more, be
interpreted terms "three zone" phenomenon.
