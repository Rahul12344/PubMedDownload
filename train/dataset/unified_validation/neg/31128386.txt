to infect mammalian cells, infectious viruses must cross common set of
biophysical membrane barriers gain access cell. virus capsid
proteins attach host cell, become endocytosed, traffic viral genome 
to sites replication. must interact membrane-confined
organelles control endocytosis, endosomal sorting, processing, and
degradation biological molecules. review, highlight recent
advances understanding mechanisms small non-enveloped dna
tumor viruses, human papillomavirus (hpv) polyomaviruses (pyv) employ
to attain infectious entry. viruses exploit different pathways mediate
entry, uncoating subsequent transport nucleus via trans golgi
network (tgn) endoplasmic reticulum (er). understanding viral
capsid proteins interact cellular membranous organelles sheds light the
novel ways viruses hi-jack endocytic transport pathways provides
unique insights highly complex machinery controlling cargo fate
determination regulated within cell.
