background: based epidemiological data, infections specific types hpv 
can classified high-risk (hr), low-risk (lr) intermediate-risk (ir) hpv 
depending risk progression cervical cancer.
case: 70-year-old woman consulted relapse abnormal cytology with
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsil) associated hpv-83
infection. histological examination demonstrated high-grade cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (cin iii) strong diffuse staining the
p16(ink4a)-specific antibody.
conclusion: patient's intermediate-risk hpv infection (hpv-83) rapidly
progressed severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin iii) strong
anti-p16(ink4a) immunolabelling. analysis e6 peptide sequence revealed
several mutations one two putative zinc finger regions (aa residues
107-135) associated p53 binding.
