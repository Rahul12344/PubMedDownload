hepatitis b viruses pararetroviruses contain partially dsdna genome
and replicate dna rna intermediate (the pregenomic rna, pgrna) by
reverse transcription. viral assembly begins packaging pgrna into
nucleocapsids (ncs), subsequent reverse transcription within ncs converting 
the pgrna characteristic dsdna genome. ncs containing dsdna
(the so-called "mature" ncs) enveloped viral envelope proteins and
secreted virions; "immature" ncs, i.e., containing pgrna immature
reverse transcription intermediates, excluded virion formation. this
phenomenon thought caused emergence intrinsic maturation
signal mature ncs. define maturation signal, devised a
method separate mature immature duck hepatitis b virus ncs have
compared ncs derived secreted virions. detailed mass spectrometric
analyses revealed core protein immature ncs phosphorylated on
at least six sites, whereas core protein mature ncs from
secreted virions entirely dephosphorylated. results, together 
known requirement core phosphorylation pgrna packaging dna synthesis, 
suggest nc undergoes dynamic change phosphorylation state to
fulfill multiple roles different stages viral replication. although
phosphorylation ncs required efficient rna packaging dna
synthesis immature ncs, dephosphorylation mature ncs may trigger
envelopment secretion.
