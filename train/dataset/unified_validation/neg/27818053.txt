infectious plant diseases caused pathogenic microorganisms fungi, 
bacteria, viruses, viroids, phytoplasma nematodes. worldwide, plant pathogen 
infections among main factors limiting crop productivity increasing
economic losses. plant pathogen detection important first step manage 
plant disease greenhouses, field conditions country boarders.
current immunological techniques used detect pathogens plant include
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa) direct tissue blot immunoassays
(dtbia). dna-based techniques polymerase chain reaction (pcr), real time 
pcr (rt-pcr) dot blot hybridization also proposed pathogen
identification detection. however methodologies time-consuming 
require complex instruments, suitable in-situ analysis.
consequently, strong interest developing new biosensing systems 
early detection plant diseases high sensitivity specificity the
point-of-care. context, revise recent advancement the
development advantageous biosensing systems plant pathogen detection based
on antibody dna receptors. use different nanomaterials as
nanochannels metallic nanoparticles development innovative and
sensitive biosensing systems detection pathogens (i.e. bacteria and
viruses) point-of-care also shown. plastic paper-based platforms
have used purpose, offering cheap easy-to-use really integrated
sensing systems rapid on-site detection. beside devices developed research
and development level brief revision commercially available kits also
included review.
