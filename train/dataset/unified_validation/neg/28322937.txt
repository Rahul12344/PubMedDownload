overexpression activation p-glycoprotein (p-gp), mediates efflux
transport various anticancer drugs cancer cells, associated with
multidrug resistance (mdr). hand, malignant cancer cells frequently 
undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt), thereby acquiring high
migratory mobility invasive ability. snail transcriptional factor that
represses multiple factors, overexpression trigger emt.
because p-gp snail involved malignant evolution cancer, in
this work, evaluated whether emt induced overexpression snail influences
p-gp expression activity. snail-overexpressing cells showed downregulation of
epithelial markers, e-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1, upregulation of
mesenchymal markers, vimentin zeb1. although western blot analysis showed
that p-gp expression levels similar mock snail-overexpressing cells, 
the results p-gp functional assays p-gp substrates rhodamine123 and
paclitaxel indicated p-gp activated snail-overexpressing cells.
indeed, snail-overexpressing cells showed greater viability mock cells in
the presence paclitaxel. observed caveolin-1 dephosphorylation and
decreased growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (grb2) expression in
snail-overexpressing cells. findings suggest novel pathway leading to
cancer mdr, snail induces emt concomitantly decrease in
grb2-mediated caveolin-1 phosphorylation, resulting activation p-gp.
