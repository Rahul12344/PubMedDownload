background: schmallenberg virus (sbv), novel orthobunyavirus simbu
serogroup, first identified october 2011 dairy cattle germany, where
it caused fever, diarrhea drop milk yield. since then, sbv additionally 
has detected adult sheep goats. although symptoms acute infection 
were observed, infection vulnerable phase pregnancy caused
congenital malformations stillbirths. view current situation and
the possible emergence simbu serogroup members, pan-simbu real-time 
reverse transcriptase (rt) pcr system reliable detection simbu
serogroup viruses developed.
methods: study pan-simbu real-time rt-pcr system established and
compared several sbv real-time rt-pcr assays. pcr-systems tested
using panel different simbu serogroup viruses well several field
samples diseased cattle, sheep goats originating germany. 
several pan-simbu real-time rt-pcr products sequenced via sanger sequencing.
furthermore, silico analyses performed investigate suitability the
detection orthobunyaviruses.
results: tested members simbu serogroup (n = 14) well of
the field samples successfully detected pan-simbu real-time rt-pcr
system. comparison intercalating dye assay different taqman
probe-based assays developed sbv diagnostics confirmed functionality of
the pan-simbu assay screening purposes. however, sbv-taqman-assay sbv-s3 
delivered highest analytical sensitivity less ten copies per reaction
for duplex systems including internal control. addition, confirmation
of sbv-genome detection highly specific sbv-m1 assay established.
conclusion: pan-simbu real-time rt-pcr system able detect tested
members simbu serogroup, sbv field samples well three
tested bunyamwera serogroup viruses suitable sensitivity. according 
silico analyses, system seems able detect broad orthobunyavirus
spectrum. additional feature pan-simbu real-time rt-pcr system,
subsequent species classification via sequencing feasible. regarding sbv
diagnostics, performance s-segment targeting sbv-s3 assay superior
with respect analytical sensitivity.
