during hepadnavirus infection, viral dna integrates low rate random
sites host dna, producing unique virus-cell junctions detectable by
inverse nested pcr (invpcr). junctions serve genetic markers of
individual hepatocytes, providing means detect subsequent
proliferation clones two hepatocytes. previous study suggested 
that livers 2.4-year-old woodchucks (marmota monax) chronically infected
with woodchuck hepatitis virus contained least 100,000 clones >1,000
hepatocytes (w. s. mason, a. r. jilbert, j. summers, proc. natl. acad. sci.
usa 102:1139-1144, 2005). however, possible correlations sites of
viral-dna integration clonal expansion could explored the
woodchuck genome yet sequenced. order investigate this
issue, looked similar clonal expansion hepatocytes livers of
chimpanzees chronically infected hepatitis b virus (hbv). liver samples 
invpcr collected eight chimpanzees chronically infected hbv at
least 20 years. fifty clones ranging size approximately 35 10,000
hepatocytes detected using invpcr 32 liver biopsy fragments
(approximately 1 mg) containing, total, approximately 3 x 10(7) liver cells.
based searching analogous human genome, integration sites found on
all chromosomes except y, approximately 30% known predicted genes. however,
no obvious association extent clonal expansion integration
site apparent. suggests integration site per se not
responsible outgrowth large clones hepatocytes.
