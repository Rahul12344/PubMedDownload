experimental clinical studies suggest influenza virus promotes
streptococcus pneumoniae-induced otitis media; however, mechanism underlying 
this synergistic interaction completely defined. study,
glycoconjugate expression patterns evaluated cell surface the
chinchilla eustachian tube (et) lumen cohort challenged intranasally (i.n.) 
with s. pneumoniae type 6a, predominantly transparent cohort 
an antecedent influenza virus infection, followed i.n. inoculation s.
pneumoniae. labeling patterns obtained six lectin probes revealed that
the binding bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin ii, succinylated wheat germ
agglutinin, peanut agglutinin significantly increased lumenal
surface et cohort infected pathogens compared the
cohort inoculated s. pneumoniae, indicated that
n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) d-galactose residues exposed. significant
decreased labeling sambucus nigra agglutinin combined influenza a
virus pneumococcus infection cohort suggested sialic acid
residues remaining et epithelium. addition, colonial opacity s. 
pneumoniae disease course examined. opaque phenotype was
predominant among pneumococcus isolates middle-ear fluid the
cohort infected pathogens. together, data suggest the
synergic effect influenza virus s. pneumoniae changes the
carbohydrate moieties et epithelium selection opaque
variant may facilitate pneumococcal invasion middle ear.
