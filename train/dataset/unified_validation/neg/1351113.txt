murine cytomegalovirus causes diffuse myocardial lesions immunologically
intact young adult male balb/cby mice. cardiac changes develop around 
the small penetrating blood vessels heart perivascular and
interstitial infiltrates macrophages lymphocytes accumulate. focal lesions
of coronary vessels endocardium also appear. infected mice are
depleted cd4+ lymphocytes, myocardial lesions fail develop even though
virus replication heart enhanced. contrary wise, cd4+ cells are
adoptively transferred infected, thymectomized, irradiated, bone
marrow-repleted mice, focal perivascular necrotizing lesions heart
develop. depletion cd8+ lymphocytes fails influence virus replication and
the development cardiac lesions. endothelial endocardial cells appear to
be major sites virus replication heart. delayed hypersensitivity is
hypothesized mechanism cardiac injury model system.
