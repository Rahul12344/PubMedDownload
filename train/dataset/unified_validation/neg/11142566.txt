since discovery hepatitis c virus, availability serological
hepatitis c virus screening led identification many subjects with
normal aminotransferase levels chronically infected hepatitis c
virus. date, epidemiology natural history subjects normal
aminotransferase levels far clarified. further, whether subjects
with persistently normal aminotransferase levels routinely undergo liver
biopsy still extremely controversial, benefit interferon treatment in
this group patients yet proven. account consistent
normality aminotransferases, easy calculate rate persons
with normal aminotransferase levels among chronic hepatitis c virus carriers, nor
their prevalence general population. estimated 25% 
of patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection persistently normal
aminotransferase levels (10% 40%, according different studies). most
studies showed clear prevalence females, ranging 58% 90%. liver
biopsy shows degree chronic liver disease 80% subjects,
although majority, histological damage mild probably not
progress severe liver disease, moreover, progression fibrosis is
slower patients elevated aminotransferase levels. virological
features subjects (hepatitis c virus genotype distribution, viral load, 
quasispecies diversity) differ respect patients elevated
aminotransferase levels although higher frequency non 1 hepatitis c virus
types reported. date, biochemical virological tools assess
the presence severity liver damage exist. antiviral treatment with
interferon may induce long-term response small proportion of
hepatitis c virus carriers persistently normal aminotransferase levels, 
many patients develop aminotransferase-flare-up shortly after
treatment. thus, interferon combination antiviral treatment hepatitis c
virus carriers normal aminotransferase values avoided clinical 
practice.
