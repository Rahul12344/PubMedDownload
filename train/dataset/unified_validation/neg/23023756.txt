to reduce high-salt waste cucumber fermentations, low-salt fermentations are
under development. fermentations may require use starter cultures to
ensure normal fermentations. potential phage infection cause starter 
culture failure, important understand phage ecology the
fermentations. study investigated phage ecology commercial cucumber
fermentation. brine samples taken fermentation tank 90-day period
were plated onto deman-rogosa-sharpe agar plates. total 576 lactic acid
bacterial isolates randomly selected serve potential hosts phage
isolation. filtered brine served phage source. fifty-seven independent phage
isolates obtained, indicating 10% bacterial isolates were
sensitive phage attack. phage hosts include lactobacillus brevis (67% all
hosts), lactobacillus plantarum (21%), weissella paramesenteroides, weissella
cibaria, pediococcus ethanolidurans. nearly 50% phages isolated on
day 14, majority attacked l. brevis. phages broad host
range capable infecting multiple hosts two genera. phages
were species specific strain specific. 30% phage isolates produced
turbid pinpoint plaques caused reduced cell growth bacterial
lawns. six phages distinct host ranges characterized. data from
this study showed abundant diverse phages present commercial
cucumber fermentation, could cause significant mortality lactic acid
bacteria population. therefore, phage control strategy may needed in
low-salt cucumber fermentations.
