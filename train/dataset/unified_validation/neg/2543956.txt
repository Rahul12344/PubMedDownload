recently tentatively identified, sequence comparison, central domains of
the ns3 proteins flaviviruses respective portion pestivirus
polyprotein rna helicases (a.e.g. et al., submitted). alignment the
n-proximal domains proteins revealed conservation short sequence
stretches resembling around catalytic ser, asp residues of
chymotrypsin-like proteases. statistically significant similarity been
detected sequences domains c-terminal
serine protease domains alphavirus capsid proteins. suggested that
flavivirus ns3 respective pestivirus protein contain least two
functional domains, n-proximal protease c-proximal helicase one. 
protease domain probably involved processing viral non-structural
proteins.
