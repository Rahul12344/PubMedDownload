cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (ccyv) cucurbit yellow stunting disorder
virus (cysdv) whitefly-transmitted criniviruses infecting cucurbit crops
inducing similar symptoms. single multiplex rt-pcr protocols developed
and evaluated cucurbit samples collected commercial greenhouses. primers 
and probes designed highly conserved heat shock protein 70 homolog 
(hsp70h) gene. conventional rt-pcr multiplex rt-pcr assays showed high
specificity suitability routine screening. taqman-based quantitative
real-time rt-pcr (rt-qpcr) protocols also developed detection and
quantitation viruses occurring single mixed infection. assays
proved highly specific cross amplification. rt-qpcr assays showed a
100-1000 times improved sensitivity conventional rt-pcr. virus titers in
mixed infections compared singly infected plants rt-qpcr. cysdv and
ccyv titers decreased double infected plants. paper reports highly
specific conventional rt-pcr quantitative real-time pcr assays detection,
quantitation differentiation two closely related cucurbit-infecting
criniviruses.
