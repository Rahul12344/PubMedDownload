japanese encephalitis, west nile, usutu murray valley encephalitis viruses
form tight subgroup within larger flavivirus genus. viruses utilize a
single-polyprotein expression strategy, resulting ~10 mature proteins.
plotting conservation synonymous sites along polyprotein coding
sequence reveals strong conservation peaks 5' end coding
sequence, also 5' end sequence encoding ns2a protein. 
peaks generally indicative functionally important non-coding sequence
elements. second peak corresponds predicted stable pseudoknot structure 
whose biological importance supported compensatory mutations preserve 
the structure. pseudoknot preceded conserved slippery heptanucleotide
(y ccu uuu), thus forming classical stimulatory motif -1 ribosomal
frameshifting. hypothesize, therefore, functional importance the
pseudoknot stimulate portion ribosomes shift -1 nt short (45
codon), conserved, overlapping open reading frame, termed foo. since cleavage 
the ns1-ns2a boundary known require synthesis ns2a cis, resulting
transframe fusion protein predicted ns1-ns2a(n-term)-foo. hypothesize
that may explain origin previously identified ns1 'extension'
protein jev-group flaviviruses, known ns1'.
