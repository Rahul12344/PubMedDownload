for public health safety, vaccines pharmaceutical products well as
the raw materials used manufacture need tested adventitious
virus contamination. current standard practice develop culture-based
or polymerase chain reaction assays types viruses one might expect
based upon source reagents used. high-throughput sequencing technology 
well-suited building unbiased strategy purpose adventitious
virus detection. developed approach automate curation publically
available nucleotide sequences, practically balanced desire to
capture viral diversity simultaneously reducing use partial
viral sequences represent largest source false positive results. in
addition, describe effective workflow virus detection process 
sequence data currently available high-throughput sequencing
technologies produce report summarizes weight sequence data 
support detected virus.
