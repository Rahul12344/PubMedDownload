soybean mosaic virus (smv) member potyvirus genus causes severe
yield loss destroys seed quality soybean [glycine max (l.) merr.]. is
important explore new resistance sources discover new resistance loci to
smv, provide insights improve breeding strategies smv
resistance. here, genome-wide association study conducted accelerate
molecular breeding improvement resistance smv soybean. a
population 165 soybean mutants derived two soybean parents used in
this study. 104 snps identified significantly associated with
resistance sc7, located within previous reported
quantitative trait loci. three putative genes chromosome 1, 9, 12 were
homologous wrky72, eef1bÎ², rlp9, involved defense response
to insect disease arabidopsis. moreover, expression levels these
three genes changed resistance susceptible soybean accessions smv
infection. three putative genes may involve resistance sc7 be
worthy research. collectively, markers significantly associated with
resistance sc7 helpful molecular marker-assisted selection for
breeding resistant soybean accessions smv, candidate genes identified 
would advance functional study resistance smv soybean.
