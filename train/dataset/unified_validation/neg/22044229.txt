human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), pathogen acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), causes ~2 millions death every year still
defies effective vaccine. hiv-1 infects host cells envelope protein - 
mediated virus-cell fusion. transmembrane subunit envelope protein, gp41, 
is molecular machinery facilitates fusion. ectodomain contains
several distinguishing functional domains, fusion peptide (fp), nterminal heptad 
repeat (nhr), c-terminal heptad repeat (chr) membrane proximal extracellular 
region (mper). fusion process, fp inserts host cell membrane,
and extended gp41 prehairpin conformation bridges viral cell membranes
through mper fp respectively. subsequent conformational change the
unstable prehairpin results coiled-coil 6-helix bundle (6hb) structure
formed nhr chr. energetics 6hb formation drives membrane
apposition fusion. drugs targeting gp41 functional domains prevent 6hb
formation inhibit hiv-1 infection. t20 (enfuvirtide, fuzeon) approved 
us fda 2003 first fusion inhibitor. 36-residue peptide the
gp41 chr, inhibits 6hb formation targeting nhr lipids. development 
of new fusion inhibitors, especially small molecule drugs, encouraged to
overcome shortcomings t20 peptide drug. hydrophobic characteristics
and membrane association critical gp41 function mechanism action. 
research gp41-membrane interactions, using peptides corresponding specific 
functional domains, constructs including several interactive domains, are
reviewed get better understanding gp41 mediated virus-cell fusion
that inform guide design new hiv-1 fusion inhibitors.
