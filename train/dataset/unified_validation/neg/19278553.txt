manipulation programmed cell death (pcd) central many host microbe
interactions. plant animal cells use pcd powerful weapon against
biotrophic pathogens, including viruses, draw nutrition living
tissue. thus, diverse biotrophic pathogens evolved many mechanisms to
suppress programmed cell death, mutualistic commensal microbes may employ
similar mechanisms. necrotrophic pathogens derive nutrition dead
tissue, many produce toxins specifically trigger programmed cell death 
their hosts. hemibiotrophic pathogens manipulate pcd exquisite way,
suppressing pcd biotrophic phase stimulating the
necrotrophic phase. mini-review summarize mechanisms have
evolved diverse microbes hosts controlling pcd gene ontology
terms developed plant-associated microbe gene ontology (pamgo) consortium 
for describing mechanisms.
