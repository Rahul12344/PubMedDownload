infection esrd undergoing hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis received
open-label sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg) daily 12 weeks.
patients hcv treatment naive treatment experienced without cirrhosis or
with compensated cirrhosis. patients previously treated hcv ns5a
inhibitor eligible. primary efficacy endpoint proportion 
patients achieving sustained virologic response (svr) 12 weeks after
