intergeneric conjugal transfer plasmid dna escherichia coli to
streptomyces circumvents problems host-controlled restriction and
instability foreign dna transformation streptomyces protoplasts.
the anthracycline antibiotic-producing strains streptomyces peucetius and
streptomyces sp. strain c5 transformed using e. coli et12567(puz8002) a
conjugal donor. donor species, carrying pset152, mated with
streptomyces strains, resident plasmid mobilized recipient the
transferred dna also integrated recipient chromosome. analysis of
the exconjugants showed stable integration plasmid single chromosomal
site (attb) streptomyces genome. dna sequence chromosomal
integration site determined shown conserved. however, core
sequence, crossover presumably occurred c5 s. peucetius, ttc.
these results also showed phic31 integrative recombination active and
the phage attp site functional s. peucetius well c5. the
efficiency specificity phic31-mediated site-specific integration the
plasmid presence 3.7-kb homologous dna sequence indicates that
integrative recombination preferred conditions. integration of
plasmid dna affect antibiotic biosynthesis biosynthesis essential
amino acids. integration single copy mutant chic wild-type s. 
peucetius chromosome led production 30-fold chitinase.
