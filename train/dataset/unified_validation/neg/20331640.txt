poliovirus 2b protein well-known viroporin implicated plasma membrane
permeabilization ions low-molecular-weight compounds infection.
translation mammalian cells expressing 2b protein inhibited hygromycin b
(hb) remains unaffected mock cells, permeable the
inhibitor. describe previously unreported bystander effect which
healthy baby hamster kidney (bhk) cells become sensitive hb co-cultured
with low proportion cells expressing poliovirus 2b. viroporins e mouse 
hepatitis virus, 6k sindbis virus ns4a protein hepatitis c virus
were also able permeabilize neighbouring cells different extents.
expression 2b induced permeabilization neighbouring cell lines than
bhk. found gap junctions responsible mediating observed bystander
permeabilization. gap junctional communication confirmed 2b-expressing
co-cultures fluorescent dye transfer. moreover, presence connexin 43
was confirmed mock 2b-transfected cells. finally, inhibition hb
entry neighbouring cells observed 18alpha-glycyrrhethinic acid, an
inhibitor gap junctions. taken together, findings support mechanism
involving gap junctional intercellular communication bystander
permeabilization effect observed healthy cells co-cultured poliovirus
2b-expressing cells.
