a sensitive, selective, rapid protocol detecting ralstonia solanacearum
from soil plant tissues developed based integration rapid
self-replicating ability bacteriophages quantitative pcr (q-pcr). six
bacteriophages isolated selected ability specifically
infect lyse r. solanacearum. sixty-three strains r. solanacearum 72
isolates bacterial species tested susceptibility the
bacteriophages. based large host range observed replication speed 
reproductive burst sizes ginger infecting r. solanacearum strain gw-1, phage
m_ds1 selected development phage-based indirect assay. with
primers based phage genome, protocol used detect r.
solanacearum number substrates. pure r. solanacearum cultures, the
protocol consistently detected approximately 3.3 cfu/ml hour's
incubation 5.3x10(2) pfu/ml m_ds1. used protocol confirm the
presence pathogen infected potted ginger plants, detecting levels near 
10(2) cfu/g 0.1 g leaf tissue levels near 10(3) cfu/ml drainage
water pots. soils emended bacteria, observed detection
limits approximately 10(2) cfu/g.
