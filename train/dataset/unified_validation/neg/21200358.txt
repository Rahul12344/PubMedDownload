objectives: systematic literature review meta-analysis performed to
evaluate impact prophylaxis palivizumab mortality morbidity
associated respiratory syncytial virus infection infants high risk (â‰¤ 
35 wks gestational age, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease).
data sources: medline, embase, current contents used. medline was
searched january 1, 1990 may 16, 2007. bibliographies accepted
studies recent reviews proceedings past 2 yrs searched to
identify additional relevant studies.
study selection: randomized controlled trials prospective retrospective
cohort studies evaluating all-cause respiratory syncytial virus-specific
mortality, respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations, health care use in
infants high risk respiratory syncytial virus infection receiving
prophylaxis palivizumab.
data extraction: data elements accepted study extracted one
researcher confirmed second researcher. differences resolved before
data entry analysis.
data synthesis: total 2473 citations screened ten comparative
studies palivizumab prophylaxis evaluating >15,000 infants included.
comparisons mortality hospitalization outcomes infant groups using
prophylaxis using prophylaxis made using meta-analyses.
conclusions: prophylaxis nonprophylaxis infant groups appeared be
comparable baseline. all-cause mortality respiratory syncytial
virus season 12 6380 (0.19%) infants prophylaxis vs. 33 8182
(0.53%) infants without prophylaxis (peto odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence
interval, 0.17-0.55). five respiratory syncytial virus-specific deaths 
reported, majority studies report respiratory syncytial
virus-related deaths. rate respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization was
significantly lower among preterm infants prophylaxis compared those
without prophylaxis (4.1% vs. 10.4%; odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval,
0.25-0.47). prophylaxis palivizumab associated reduction in
all-cause mortality respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization among preterm
infants high risk. additional research cause death among infants high
risk needed.
