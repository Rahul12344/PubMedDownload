virus-like particles isolated oviducts parasitoid wasp,
hyposoter exiguae (hymenoptera: ichneumonidae). particles readily purified by
centrifugation either ficoll sucrose gradients. double-stranded circular
dna isolated purified particles heterodisperse terms molecular
weight; none molecules sufficiently large code aggregate of
structural proteins comprising particles. preliminary southern blot
hybridization data suggest minimal sequence homology the
different size classes dna examined.
