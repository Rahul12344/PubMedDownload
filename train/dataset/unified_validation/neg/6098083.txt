undefined etiology.

booss j, kim jh.

the histopathology herpes simplex encephalitis (hse) described
principally postmortem studies reveal end-stage disease. biopsy
material, selects earlier stage disease development, used
principally isolate virus, identify viral particles, locate viral
antigens. further, little attention paid histopathology of
biopsies encephalitis undefined etiology. present study, sections
from biopsies yielded virus negative virus were
evaluated systematic controlled manner. biopsies yielding virus were
characterized meningeal inflammation, perivascular infiltrates, glial
nodules. biopsies yield virus failed reveal another
diagnosis characterized nonspecific gliosis. thus early
histiopathology hse characterized early signs inflammation the
absence necrosis generally differs biopsies virus not
isolated.
