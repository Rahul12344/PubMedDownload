hot pepper (capsicum annuum) plants exhibit hypersensitive response (hr)
against infection many tobamoviruses. clone (capr-4) encoding putative
pathogenesis-related protein 4 isolated differential screening cdna
library prepared resistant pepper plant leaves inoculated tobacco
mosaic virus (tmv) pathotype p0. predicted amino acid sequence capr-4 is
very similar plant pr-4s. southern blot analysis showed that
small gene families pr-4-related sequences present pepper genome. 
hot pepper cultivar bugang, resistant tmv-p0 susceptible tmv-p1.2,
induced capr-4 expression pathotype p0 inoculation inoculated systemic 
leaves, pathotype p1.2. effects exogenously applied abiotic
elicitors upon capr-4 expression also examined. expression the
capr-4 gene stimulated methyl jasmonate (meja), ethephon wounding
treatment. however, application salicylic acid (sa) trigger the
expression. evidence emerging jasmonic acid ethylene play key roles
in sa-independent pathways plant-pathogen interaction. taken together,
these results suggest capr-4 gene one defense-related genes
conferring resistance pepper plants sa-independent pathway the
cross-talk signaling compounds, jasmonic acid ethylene could a
great regulatory potential plant's defense tmv.
