to understand possible mechanisms transmission aujeszky's disease virus
(pseudorabies prv) feral pig reservoir, intranasal infections were
initiated domestic pigs pigs herd derived captured feral
pigs. virus strains originating feral pigs domestic pigs were
compared. similar shedding patterns obtained feral-derived and
domestic pigs, however, virus strains feral pigs markedly attenuated.
virus could isolated acute infection nasal secretions, tonsils 
occasionally genital organs. studies transmission prv by
cannibalism, either latently infected acutely infected tissue fed 
domestic feral-derived pigs. two similar experiments, latently infected
tissue transmit virus, tissues acutely infected pigs did
transmit infection. cannibalism observed typically types pigs
older 6 weeks age. concluded transmission prv originating 
from feral pigs occur several mechanisms including respiratory route
and cannibalism pigs die acute infection. transmission prv 
feral swine may, however, result sub-clinical infection.
