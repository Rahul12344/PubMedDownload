autoantibodies soluble liver enzymes reported among alcoholics,
but targets self-reactivity toward membrane proteins liver not
been characterized. previously, among alcoholics, found antibodies against
ethanol-derived radical protein adducts dependent cytochrome p-4502e1
(cyp2e1) formation. investigate autoantibodies against
cytochrome p-450s alcohol abuse, sera rats chronically treated with
ethanol total enteral nutrition model sera alcoholics or
without alcohol liver disease control subjects analyzed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay western blotting presence igg
against rat human cyp2e1, rat cyp3a1, human cyp3a4. time-dependent
appearance igg rat cyp3a1 cyp2e1 evident chronic
ethanol feeding rats. anti-cyp2e1 reactivity showed positive correlation 
the levels hepatic cyp2e1 inhibited cyp2e1 transcriptional
inhibitor chlormethiazole. screening human sera enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay revealed reactivity cyp3a4 cyp2e1 20 
30% 10 20% alcoholic sera, respectively. difference noted
between sera alcoholics without hepatitis c virus infection, and
only little reactivity seen sera control subjects. western
blotting analysis revealed anti-human cyp2e1 reactivity 8 85 alcoholic sera
and 3 58 control sera, whereas anti-cyp3a4 reactivity detected 18 85
alcoholic sera 4 58 control sera, different sera
reactive cyp2e1. immunoblot reactivity cyp3a4-positive alcoholic sera was
found glutathione-s-transferase fusion proteins containing truncated
forms cyp3a4, sera also able immunoprecipitate vitro
translated cyp3a4. seven eight sera showed reactivity toward domains
c-terminal position ser281, 1 8 sera recognized autoepitopes within the
region thr207-ser281. findings indicate alcoholics develop
autoantibodies cyp2e1 cyp3a4 cyp3a4 c-terminal domain a
target autoantibody reactions among subset alcoholics. novel
finding cyp3a4 autoantibodies significant expression among
alcoholics warrants investigation. attention given immune
toxicity associated cyp3a4 autoantibodies cases alcohol abuse that
are accompanied exposure drugs substances cyp3a substrates.
