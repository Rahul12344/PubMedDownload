the constitutive activation signal transducer activator transcription 3
(stat3) participates carcinogenesis up-regulation genes encoding
apoptosis inhibitors cell cycle regulators, bcl-xl, cyclins d1 and
d2, c-myc. suppressor cytokine signaling 3 (socs3) one negative 
regulators cytokine signaling frequently silenced diverse cancers.
in study, explored whether restoration socs3 oncolytic adenoviral
vectors could inhibit constitutive activation janus kinase/stat
pathway suppress tumor growth. data showed socs3 down-expressed 
in liver tumor cell lines. incorporation socs3 socs3 fused with
cell-penetrating peptides (cpp-socs3) alter adenoviral replication
selectively liver tumor cells. infection cells adenovirus cn305
(adcn305)-socs3 adcn305-cpp-socs3 resulted dramatic cytotoxicity liver 
tumor cells. however, cytotoxic effect observed normal cells infected
with vectors. infection liver tumor cells adcn305-socs3 and
adcn305-cpp-socs3 resulted nearly complete inhibition stat3 phosphorylation
and down-regulation cyclin d1 bcl-xl. treatment established tumor
by adcn305-socs3 adcn305-cpp-socs3 caused significant suppression tumor
growth. suppression tumor growth due inhibition stat3
phosphorylation induction tumor cell death.conclusion: study suggests
that transfer socs3 oncolytic adenovirus represents potent approach
for cancer therapy.
