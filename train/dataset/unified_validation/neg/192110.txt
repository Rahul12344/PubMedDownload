a virus isolated spleen white-tailed deer (odocoileus
virginianus) died epizootic washington state 1967.
inoculation 10% spleen suspension deer caused hemorrhagic disease
in normal white-tailed deer. studies conducted biological,
physicochemical, serologic properties washington isolate. vitro 
assay system, utilizing cultured primary white-tailed deer fetal cells 
an entire fetus, employed isolation propagation virus.
cytopathic effect characterized focal development rounded clumped
cells. propagation unsuccessful suckling mice, bhk-21, vero cell
cultures. virus resistant treatment ether, sodium deoxycholate,
trypsin, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, sensitive chloroform. virus
yield affected infected cultures treated with
5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, dactinomycin (actinomycin d) treatment infected
cultures reduced virus yield. virus inactivated heated 70 c 5
minutes exposed ph 5 18 hours 4 c. virus completely
excluded filtrate 0.10- micronm (apd) membrane filter. staining 
infected cells acridine orange indicated presence double-standard
nucleic acid cytoplasm. serum-neutralization tests antiserums against
the homologous virus new jersey alberta strains epizootic
hemorrhagic disease virus resulted neutralization washington isolate.
the washington virus neutralized bluetongue virus antiserum. cells
infected washington isolate exhibited intracytoplasmic fluorescence by
the indirect fluorescent antibody method new jersey alberta epizootic
hemorrhagic disease antiserums bluetongue antiserum.
