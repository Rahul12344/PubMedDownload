viruses recently emerged ideal protein scaffolds new class of
contrast agents used medical imaging procedures positron
emission tomography (pet) magnetic resonance imaging (mri). whereas synthetic
nanoparticles difficult produce homogeneous formulations due the
inherently stochastic nature synthesis process, virus-based nanoparticles 
are genetically encoded therefore produced homogeneous and
monodisperse preparations high degree quality control. the
virus capsids defined chemical structure evolved carry cargoes
of nucleic acids, modified carry precisely defined cargoes of
contrast agents decorated spatially defined contrast reagents 
the internal external surfaces. viral nanoparticles also genetically
programed conjugated targeting ligands deliver contrast agents to
specific cells, natural biocompatibility viruses means are
cleared rapidly body. nanoparticles based bacteriophages plant
viruses safe use humans produced inexpensively large
quantities self-assembling recombinant proteins. based these
considerations, new generation contrast agents developed using
bacteriophages plant viruses scaffolds carry positron-emitting
radioisotopes [(18) f] fluorodeoxyglucose pet imaging iron oxide 
or gd(3+) mri. although challenges immunogenicity, loading
efficiency, regulatory compliance remain address, virus-based
nanoparticles represent promising new enabling technology new generation 
of highly biocompatible biodegradable targeted imaging reagents.
