marburg virus (marv) causes severe hemorrhagic fever humans high
mortality rate. rapid accurate identification virus required to
appropriately provide infection control outbreak management. here, we
developed evaluated one-step reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (rt-lamp) assay rapid simple detection marv. by
combining two sets primers specific musoke ravn genetic lineages, 
a multiple rt-lamp assay detected marv strains lineages, no
cross-reactivity hemorrhagic fever viruses (ebola virus lassa
virus) observed. assay could detect 10(2) copies viral rna per
tube within 40 min real-time monitoring turbidities reaction
mixtures. assay evaluated using viral rna extracted clinical
specimens collected 2005 marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak angola 
yielded positive results samples containing marv greater 10(4) 50%
tissue culture infective doses/ml, exhibiting 78% (14 18 samples positive)
consistency results reverse transcription-pcr assay carried 
the field laboratory. results obtained agarose gel electrophoresis
and naked-eye judgment indicated rt-lamp assay developed study
is effective tool molecular detection marv. furthermore, seems
suitable use field diagnostics laboratories areas marv 
endemic.
