introduction: matrix metalloproteinase-8 (mmp-8; neutrophil collagenase) an
important regulator innate immunity oncosuppressive actions in
numerous tumor types.
methods: intercrossed mmp8-null mice polyoma virus middle t
oncogene-driven (mmtv-pymt) mouse model mammary cancer explore effects 
of loss mmp-8 incidence progression mammary carcinomas.
results: aggressive mouse model breast cancer, loss mmp-8
accelerated tumor onset even further, 90% mmtv-pymt; mmp8-null
female mice tumor-bearing time weaning. throughout 14 weeks of
the model, tumor burden increased homozygous mmp8-null mice compared to
mmp8-wild-type -heterozygote animals. likewise, lung metastasis dramatically 
increased mmtv-pymt; mmp8-null mice. immunohistochemistry revealed that
tumors wild-type, mmp8-heterozygotes -null animals similar vascular
density 8 weeks, 10 weeks mmp8-wild-type tumors lower vascularity
than heterozygote null counterparts. differences macrophage
infiltration apparent throughout primary tumor development, though at
10 weeks drop neutrophil infiltrates observed mmp8-wild-type tumors. 
using quantitative real-time rt-pcr, tracked expression entire mmp 
and timp gene families, observing significant decrease mmp3 expression in
mmp8-null tumors compared wild-type heterozygotes throughout time
course model, confirmed protein level.
conclusions: findings provide novel insight suppressive action 
mmp-8 mammary tumorigenesis metastasis, indicate loss of
mmp-8 likely pleiotropic effects innate immunity angiogenesis are
reflected changes protease web.
