to define protein folding patterns hiv-1 env subunit vaccines, have
isolated set 30 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) balb/c mice immunized with
a recombinant gp160 vaccine (rgp160) expressed baculovirus system. this
article describes epitope mapping mab panel topology epitopes 
for rgp160 recombinant gp120 (rgp120) also expressed baculovirus
system. following results reported: (1) rgp160 harbors minimum 4
antigenic domains, 3 mapping c1, c2, c3/v4 regions gp120 1
mapping cytoplasmic tail gp41; (2) least 3 adjacent or
overlapping epitopes antigenic domain; (3) minimum 14 independent
epitopes mapped, continuous sites; (4) epitopes
is exposed rgp160 without prior manipulation protein; (5) by
contrast, 6 8 epitopes mapping c1, c2, c3/v4 regions not
exposed rgp120, become exposed protein denatured. taken
together, results show rgp160 rgp120 folded differently,
illustrating use mab panel compare epitope topographies of
recombination hiv-1 env proteins. mab panel may aid refinement of
hiv-1 env subunit vaccines.
