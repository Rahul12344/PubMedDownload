studies lentivirus infection ruminants, nonhuman primates, humans
suggest virus infection macrophages plays central role disease
process. investigate whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) can
infect chimpanzee macrophages, recovered monocytes peripheral blood
mononuclear cells hiv-1-negative animals inoculated control
human monocytes panel four human-passaged monocytotropic virus strains 
and one chimpanzee-passaged isolate. hiv-1 infected human monocytes synthesized
proviral dna, viral mrna, p24 antigen, progeny virions. contrast, except
for chimpanzee-passaged hiv-1 isolate, chimpanzee monocytes failed support
hiv-1 replication cultured identical variety other
conditions. proviral dna demonstrated background levels cell
cultures polymerase chain reaction gag- env-related sequences.
interestingly, chimpanzee-passaged hiv-1 isolate replicate human
monocytes; viral p24 antigens progeny virions detected. same
monocytotropic panel hiv-1 strains replicated human chimpanzee
cd4+ lymphoblasts treated phytohemagglutinin interleukin-2. the
failure hiv-1 infect chimpanzee monocytes, overcome serial 
in vivo viral passage, occurs block early viral life cycle.
