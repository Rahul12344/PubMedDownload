particulate denatured core protein well e-antigen (hbe) hepatitis b 
virus (hbv) differ part immunologically studied in
sufficient detail. therefore, study b-cell immune response native 
and denatured hbv core protein exhibit hbe-specific epitopes was
examined using panel mouse mabs rabbit polyclonal antibodies native
and denatured core protein polyclonal anti-hbe/anti-hbc antibodies sera 
of infected patients. epitope mapping performed using set partially
overlapping synthetic hbc peptides, carboxy-terminally truncated hbc proteins and
various hbc fusion proteins. major immunogenic region amino acids
134-140 two less immunogenic regions, one spanning amino acids 2-10 one
with three partially overlapping epitopes amino acid positions 138 and
154, defined mouse mabs. polyclonal rabbit antibodies denatured hbc,
woodchuck ground squirrel hepatitis core proteins (whc gshc) recognized
similar epitopes addition occasionally region 61-85, latter was
also recognized particulate hbc. two antigenic regions (amino acid positions
2-10 138-145) found exposed hbe human serum, were
recognized mouse anti-hbe anti-hbc antibodies sera infected
patients. study demonstrates complex pattern hbc hbe epitopes 
than detected previously provides tools study conformational changes which
may take place hbc/hbe processing, transport core particle assembly.
