a wide range antiviral drugs currently available; however, drug-resistant
viruses begun emerge represent potential public health risk. here, 
we explored use compounds inhibit interfere action of
essential host factors prevent virus replication. particular, focused on
the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) inhibitor, fit-039, suppressed
replication broad spectrum dna viruses inhibition mrna
transcription. specifically, fit-039 inhibited replication herpes simplex
virus 1 (hsv-1), hsv-2, human adenovirus, human cytomegalovirus cultured
cells, topical application fit-039 ointment suppressed skin legion
formation murine hsv-1 infection model. fit-039 affect cell cycle
progression cellular proliferation host cells. compared general
cdk inhibitor flavopiridol, transcriptome analyses fit-039-treated cells
revealed fit-039 specifically inhibited cdk9. given concentrations 
the inhibitory concentration, fit-039 cytotoxic effect on
mammalian cells. importantly, administration fit-039 ameliorated severity 
of skin lesion formation mice infected acyclovir-resistant hsv-1,
without noticeable adverse effects. together, data indicate fit-039
has potential antiviral agent clinical therapeutics.
