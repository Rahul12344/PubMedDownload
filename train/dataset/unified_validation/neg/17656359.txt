microtubules cytoskeletal polymers consisting tubulin subunits take
part diverse cell activities. many viruses hijack cellular motor proteins to
move microtubules toward cell interior entry process toward
the plasma membrane egress period. addition, viruses often remodel 
microtubules facilitate generation infectious progeny. study,
we found transactivator transcription protein jembrana disease
virus (jtat) bound tubulin microtubules cells purified
system. microtubule co-sedimentation co-localization assays revealed robust
interaction jtat microtubules. tubulin turbidity assay showed
that jtat promoted tubulin polymerization vitro concentration-dependent
manner. moreover, jtat promoted partitioning cellular tubulin toward the
polymeric form, increased level tubulin acetylation, significantly
enhanced cold stability cellular microtubules. addition, jtat-mediated 
disruption microtubule dynamics induced release bim microtubules, 
leading profound apoptosis. results identify jtat an
important viral regulator microtubule dynamics also indicate that
jtat-induced apoptosis might contribute jembrana disease pathogenesis.
