the origin-specific dna-binding domain simian virus 40 large antigen was
analyzed, c-terminal boundary found amino acid
259. include zinc finger structural motif located amino
acids 302 320 (j. m. berg, science 232:485-486, 1986). interestingly,
n-terminal fragments 266 272 amino acids larger displayed dramatically
reduced origin-binding activity. addition, specific dna-binding properties
of truncated proteins purified bacterial mammalian sources were
compared. truncated antigens mammalian cells bound specific dna fragments 
more efficiently bacterial counterparts. results implicate
posttranslational modification role regulating dna-binding activity
of large antigen.
