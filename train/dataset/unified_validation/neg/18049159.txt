methods: june october 2006, 303 patients (226 male, 77 female) with
chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma recruited
(mean age 50.8+/-14.4 years; range 16-84). sera tested antibodies to
hav, overall age-specific seroprevalence anti-hav assessed.
results: hepatitis b virus infection etiology liver diseases 267
patients (88.1%), hepatitis c virus infection 36 (11.9%). the
distribution clinical diagnosis chronic hepatitis 86 patients (28.4%), 
liver cirrhosis 36 (11.9%), hepatocellular carcinoma 181 (57.9%). the
patients categorized decade age distribution follows:
nine patients (2.5%) teens, 23 (6.2%) 20s, 36 (12.4%) 
30s, 78 (25.7%) 40s, 72 (24.1%) 50s, 85 (29%) >or=61 years.
the overall seroprevalence anti-hav 87.8% (266/303), difference was
observed sex (86.7 vs. 90.9%, p=0.42). seroprevalence age group
was 22.2, 26.1, 72.2, 97.4, 100 98.8%, respectively, showing marked increase 
in 40 years age (p<0.001).
