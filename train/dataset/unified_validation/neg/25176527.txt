influenza virus (iav) infection major worldwide public health problem.
however, factors involved mediating inflammatory response this
infection relationships remain poorly understood. here, show that
iav infection stimulates expression soluble il-6 receptor (sil-6r), 
multifunctional protein involved il-6 signaling. interestingly, sil-6r
expression upregulated levels ligand, il-6 the
pro-inflammatory cytokine il-32. shrna-mediated knockdown sil-6r suppressed
il-6 il-32, indicating regulation dependent sil-6r iav
infection. furthermore, results demonstrate il-32 participates a
negative feedback loop inhibits sil-6r upregulating il-6 expression
during iav infection. therefore, show sil-6r critical cellular
factor involved acute inflammatory response viral infection.
