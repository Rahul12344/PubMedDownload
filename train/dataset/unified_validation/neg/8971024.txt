in vivo gene transfer recombinant e1-deficient adenoviruses results early
and late viral gene expression elicits host immune response, limiting 
duration transgene expression use adenoviruses gene therapy.
the prokaryotic cre-lox p recombination system adapted generate
recombinant adenoviruses extended deletions viral genome (referred to
here deleted viruses) order minimize expression immunogenic and/or
cytotoxic viral proteins. example, adenovirus 25-kb deletion that
lacked e1, e2, e3, late gene expression viral titers similar those
achieved first-generation vectors less 0.5% contamination with
e1-deficient virus produced. gene transfer similar hela cells, mouse
hepatoma cells, primary mouse hepatocytes vitro vivo determined 
by measuring reporter gene expression dna transfer. however, transgene
expression deleted viral dna concentrations stable declined to
undetectable levels much rapidly found first-generation
vectors. intravenous administration deleted vectors mice resulted no
hepatocellular injury relative seen first-generation vectors. the
mechanism stability first-generation adenovirus vectors (e1a deleted)
appeared linked part ability replicate transduced cells
in vivo vitro. furthermore, deleted vectors stabilized the
presence undeleted first-generation adenovirus vectors. results have
important consequences development nonintegrating
vectors gene therapy.
