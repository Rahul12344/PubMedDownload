self-renewal differentiation male germline stem cells (mgscs) provide 
basic function continual spermatogenesis. studies vitro culture of
germline stem cells important meaningful basic biological research
and practical application. growth factors, gdnf, bfgf, csf1, egf,
could maintain self-renewal mgscs. insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1),
an important growth factor, pathway reported maintain the
survival several types stem cells play important roles male
reproduction. however, mechanism igf-1 pathway acts to
regulate self-renewal mgscs remains unclear. analyzed effect of
igf-1 proliferation apoptosis bovine mgscs. evaluated the
expression profile long noncoding rna (lncrna) h19 bovine mouse
tissues. moreover, investigated whether lncrna h19 could regulate igf-1
pathway. results showed igf-1 could activate phosphorylation akt 
erk signaling pathways, igf-1 pathway played important role in
regulating proliferation apoptosis bovine mgscs. proliferation
rate mgscs decreased, whereas apoptosis rate mgscs increased the
igf-1 receptor (igf-1r) blocked using igf-1r-specific inhibitor
(picropodophyllin). lncrna h19 could regulate igf-1 signaling pathway and,
consequently, proliferation apoptosis mgscs. number cells in
the seminiferous tubule decreased h19 interfered injecting a
virus-containing supernatant. hence, lncrna h19 participated regulation of
the proliferation apoptosis mgscs via igf-1 signaling pathway.
