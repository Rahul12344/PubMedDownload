since efficacy oseltamivir carboxylate (oc) active metabolite of
tamiflu demonstrated influenza viruses even the
avian influenza virus (h5n1), millions tamiflu treatment courses are
stockpiled worldwide. done least follow recommendations of
the world health organization (who) cope viral influenza pandemic.
concentrations 26-32 microg l(-1) oc river catchment areas united
states united kingdom predicted recently pandemic case,
assuming apparent persistence tamiflu metabolite. concentrations
may involve risk generation antiviral resistance. still 
lack data concerning stability oc surface water environment. under
this aspect predictions validated concrete facts 
environmental fate oc. article summarized results three
different daylight exposure experiments oc different waters sterile
and non-sterile conditions simulating shallow water processes latitude 
approximately 52 degrees n. using river water solution containing 50 microg
l(-1) oc non-sterile conditions half-life time 17.8 days observed.
direct photolysis plays negligible role decomposition oc.
degradation oc seems occur combination microbial metabolism and
indirect photolysis.
