tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) exhibits specific
tumoricidal activity development cancer therapy.
mismatch-repair-deficient colonic tumors evade trail-induced apoptosis through
mutational inactivation bax, chemotherapeutics including camptosar
(cpt-11) restore trail sensitivity. however, signaling pathways restoring 
trail sensitivity remain elucidated. here, imaged p53 transcriptional
activity bax-/- carcinomas using bioluminescence, vivo, find that
p53 required sensitization trail cpt-11. small interfering rnas
directed proapoptotic p53 targets reveal trail receptor killer/dr5 contributes
significantly trail sensitization, whereas bak plays minor role. caspase 8
inhibition protects cpt-11 pretreated wild-type bax-/- hct116 cells from
trail-induced apoptosis, whereas caspase 9 inhibition rescued wild-type 
hct116 cells death induced trail. results suggest conversion the
apoptotic mechanism hct116 colon carcinoma type ii pathway involving
bax mitochondria type pathway involving efficient extrinsic
pathway caspase activation. contrast bax-/- cells, bak-deficient human
cancers undergo apoptosis response trail cpt-11, implying these
proteins nonoverlapping functions. studies elucidate mechanism for
restoration trail sensitivity mmr-deficient bax-/- human cancers through
p53-dependent activation killer/dr5 reconstitution type death
pathway. efforts identify agents up-regulate dr5 may useful cancer 
therapies restoring trail sensitivity.
