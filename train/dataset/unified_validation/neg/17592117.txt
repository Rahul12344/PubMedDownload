serum response used model studying signaling transduction for
many biological events cell proliferation survival. although
expression many genes up- down-regulated serum stimulation, the
notch effector hes1 displays oscillatory response. however, precise mechanism
and biological significance oscillation remain determined. here, we
identified serum-induced ultradian oscillators, including molecules stat and
smad signaling. stat smad oscillations involve activation stat3 smad1 
and delayed negative feedback inhibitors socs3 smad6, respectively. 
moreover, stat oscillations induce oscillatory expression hes1 regulating
its half-life, loss hes1 oscillations leads g(1) phase retardation of
the cell cycle. results indicate coupled stat hes1 oscillations
are important efficient cell proliferation provide evidence that
expression modes signaling molecules affect downstream cellular events.
