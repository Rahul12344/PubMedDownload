several co-pathogens pose threats fetus gestation, including
human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), may also contribute mother-to-child transmission
(mtct) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). within endemic settings,
associations maternal hcmv viral load increased incidence mtct 
hiv-1 documented; however, mechanisms promote transmission are
poorly characterized. demonstrate hcmv coinfection enhances
susceptibility viral replication hiv-1 placental macrophages (hofbauer 
cells) vitro. consistent enhanced viral susceptibility, hcmv exposure
upregulates ccr5 cd80 expression hofbauer cells. hcmv also significantly
induces type interferon (ifn), proinflammatory cytokines, antiviral gene
expression. interestingly, found hcmv diminishes type ifn-mediated
phosphorylation stat2. collectively, data suggest hcmv-induced
activation, local inflammation, antagonism type ifn responses in
placental hofbauer cells promote utero transmission hiv-1.
