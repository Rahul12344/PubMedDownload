we previously reported higher degree methylation cpg sites the
promoter (positions 31, 37, 43, 52, 58) enhancer site 7862 human
papillomavirus (hpv) 16 associated lower likelihood diagnosed
with hpv 16-associated cin 2+. purpose study replicate our
previous findings and, addition, evaluate influence plasma
concentrations folate vitamin b12 degree hpv 16 methylation (hpv
16m). study included 315 hpv 16-positive women diagnosed either cin 2+
or ≤cin 1. pyrosequencing technology used quantify degree hpv 16m. 
we reproduced previously reported inverse association hpv 16m and
risk diagnosed cin 2+. addition, observed women with
higher plasma folate hpv 16m higher plasma vitamin b12 hpv 
16m 75% (p < 0.01) 60% (p = 0.02) less likely diagnosed cin
2+, respectively. tertile increase plasma folate vitamin b12,
there 50% (p = 0.03) 40% (p = 0.07) increase odds a
higher degree hpv 16m, respectively. study provides initial evidence that
methyl donor micronutrients, folate vitamin b12, may play important role
in maintaining desirably high degree methylation specific cpg sites in
the hpv e6 promoter enhancer associated likelihood being
diagnosed cin 2+.
