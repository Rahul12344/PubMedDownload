a series polyoxometalates (pom) synthesized evaluated for
anti-respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) activity. pom containing zirconium,
tungsten, silicon, platinum, niobium germanium variety structural
types evaluated. sixteen compounds striking anti-rsv
activity clinical isolate, utah 89, median effective concentration
(ec50) values < = 3 microm selective indices > 80 determined viral
cytopathic inhibition effect, neutral red uptake virus yield reduction
assays. ec50 values three assays correlated well (pearson
correlation coefficients > 0.90). pom containing sodium cations totally
inactive. germanium-, niobium-, tin- zirconium-containing compounds were
found highly potent selective. antiviral activity cell
line-dependent. median cytotoxic concentration (ic50) values generally
greater 100 microm. compounds also comparably active a
known laboratory rsv strain, a2, well rsv strains. detect any
virus strain-specific inhibitory activity, seven pom tested other
rsv strains; nearly equally inhibitory human virus strains,
suggesting strain specificity. timing studies suggested compounds
were inhibitory virus adsorption penetration, although rsv was
still significantly inhibited compound added 3 h post-infection;
which considered well eclipse period. data suggest these
potent, non-toxic compounds studied potential
chemotherapeutic agents treating rsv infections.
