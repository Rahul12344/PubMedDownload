the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) macaque model aids provided a
valuable system investigate vaccine approaches protection
against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection. particular, the
ability macaques persistently infected attenuated infectious molecular
clones siv resist challenge pathogenic parental swarm has
conclusively demonstrated protective immunity achieved by
immunization prior exposure. breadth protective responses the
immunological correlates protection, however, identified. in
addition, vaccine studies mainly employed lymphocyte-tropic strains hiv-1
and siv. recent studies implicated macrophage-tropic strains the
transmission hiv-1 suggested virus strains be
examined vaccine strategies. macrophage-tropic viruses may confer additional
advantages induction protective immunity replication in
antigen-presenting cells. study, immune response rhesus macaques
inoculated attenuated macrophage-tropic recombinant sivmac239
(siv/17e-cl) evaluated respect protective immunity heterologous
challenge various times infection. vigorous type-specific
neutralizing-antibody responses restricted siv/17e-cl evident 2 weeks 
postinfection. 7 months, however, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies
emerged neutralized siv/17e-cl also heterologous primary
isolate siv/deltab670. challenge siv/17e-cl-infected monkeys with
siv/deltab670 various times postinfection demonstrated protective
responses associated appearance cross-reactive neutralizing
antibodies. furthermore, passive transfer sera siv/17e-cl-infected
animals passively protected two four naive recipients.
