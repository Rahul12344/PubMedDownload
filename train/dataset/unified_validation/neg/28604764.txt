epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection primary human b cells induces transient
period hyper-proliferation, many infected cells succumb an
ataxia telangiectasia mutated/checkpoint kinase 2 (atm/chk2)-mediated
senescence-like growth arrest. study, assessed role dna
replicative stress nucleotide pool levels limiting ebv-infected b-cell
outgrowth. found ebv triggered activation ataxia telangiectasia
and rad3-related (atr) signaling pathway early rapidly proliferating
cells, also significantly sensitive inhibition atr
pathway late attenuated proliferating cells. nuclear halo assays, we
determined early ebv-infected cells displayed increased replicative stress
and dna damage relative late proliferating cells. finally, found early
after infection, hyper-proliferating b cells exhibited limited
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dntp) pools compared late proliferating
and ebv-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines specific loss purine

of hyper-proliferation markedly enhanced b-cell immortalization ebv and
