the model locally accurate conformation hiv-thailand principal
neutralizing determinant (pnd) located within v3 loop virus envelope

nmr-based conformational analysis synthetic molecule representing peptide 
copy fragment study carried using published sequential d
connectivity data values spin-spin coupling constants. result, (i)
the local structure v3 loop thailand isolate determined, (ii)
the conformations irregular segments analyzed, secondary
structure elements identified, (iii) ensemble conformers matching the
experimental theoretical data derived stretch forming the
neutralizing epitope hiv-thailand pnd, (iv) estimate probability of
realizing conformers solution, results obtained were

39-44 bence-jonce rei protein (bjrp), 41-46 immunoglobulin lambda (ig
lambda), 50-55 beta-chain horse hemoglobin (hh), (v) find the
conserved structural motifs inside diverse hiv-1 isolates, structure
determined compared one derived earlier hiv-mn pnd nmr 
spectroscopy data, (vi) basis data obtained, 3d structure model
describing set biologically relevant conformations, may present
different antigenic determinants immune system various hiv-1 isolates, 
was proposed immunogenic crown v3 loop. results obtained are
