the genetic variation human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) protease
gene (prt) permits classification hiv-1 strains five distinct
protease subtypes, follow gag subtyping patterns. susceptibilities 
of non-b-subtype strains protease inhibitors (pis) antiretroviral
drugs remain largely unknown. subtype f main non-b strain contributing 
the brazilian epidemic, accounting 15 20% infections. this
work, report findings 81 isolates pi-naive brazilian patients
collected 1993 1997. addition, relevant pi resistance
mutations phenotypes determined vitro 15 patients 
(b = 9 f = 6). among these, subtype f samples evidenced high
sensitivities vitro ritonavir indinavir, mics 50 90% 
of isolates inhibited similar brazilian u.s.
subtype b isolates. analysis 81 brazilian prt sequences demonstrated 
the subtype f consensus sequence differs u.s. brazilian subtype b
consensus eight positions (i15v, e35d, m36i, r41k, r57k, q61n, l63p, and
l89m). frequency critical pi resistance substitutions (amino acid changes 
d30n, v82a/f/t, i84v, n88d, l90m) among brazilian isolates low (mean,
2.5%), associated secondary substitutions (amino acid positions 10l, 20k,
36m, 46m, 48g, 54i, 63p, 71a, 77a) infrequent. observations
document relative rarity resistance pis treatment patients
