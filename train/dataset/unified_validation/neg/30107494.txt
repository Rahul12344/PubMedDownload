background: proportion undiagnosed hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections in
high-risk populations, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected men
who sex men (msm) unclear. identification potential hcv
transmitters important reach world health organization hcv elimination
targets.
methods: october 2015 may 2016, performed systematic hcv
rna-based screening among hiv-infected msm participating swiss hiv cohort 
study (shcs). hcv antibodies measured hcv rna-positive samples.
results: 4257 msm recorded shcs database, screened 3722 (87%) hcv
polymerase chain reaction, 177 (4.8%) harbored replicating hcv infection.
we identified 24 individuals (14%) incident hcv infection; one-third them
had negative hcv antibody result time hcv rna positivity. a
multivariable model, elevated liver enzyme values (odds ratio, 14.52; 95%
confidence interval, 9.92-21.26), unprotected sex occasional partners (2.01;
1.36-2.98), intravenous drug use (7.13; 4.36-11.64), noninjectable drug use
(1.94; 1.3-2.88), previous syphilis diagnosis (2.56; 1.74-3.76) were
associated hcv rna positivity.
conclusions: systematic hcv rna-based screening among hiv-infected msm revealed
a high number potential transmitters. substantial subpopulation msm had
incident infection, one-third negative hcv antibody test result 
the time hcv rna positivity. data reveal one-time rna testing
of high-risk population hcv rna might identify infected persons than
routine testing hcv antibodies liver enzymes.
