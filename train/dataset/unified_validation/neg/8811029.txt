human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) genes expressed early phase infection
mediate destabilization nascent major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
class molecules infected cells thus prevent antigen presentation cd8+
t lymphocytes. report hcmv genes interfere mhc class pathway
of antigen presentation least two mechanisms. firstly, permissive infection
of fibroblasts characterized continuous decline capacity to
translocate peptides cytosol endoplasmic reticulum (er) 
transporter associated antigen processing (tap). inactivation peptide
transport operative despite augmented tap expression hcmv infection.
secondly, tap molecules fail associate mhc class heavy chains
indicating hcmv early gene expression also interferes mhc class i
maturation. temperature-sensitive mutant hcmv, ts9, lacks 15 kb dna
encoding genes us1-us15 hcmv, lost capacity interfere mhc 
class assembly inhibit peptide translocation function tap. one of
the genes deleted ts9, us11, reported downregulate expression
of mhc class molecules, affect peptide transport tap. therefore, we
conclude hcmv encodes least two early gene functions interfere 
the mhc class antigen presentation pathway.
