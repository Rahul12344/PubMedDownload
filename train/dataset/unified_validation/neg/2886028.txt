newcastle disease virus-induced fusion chick embryo (ce) chicken
erythrocytes studied ph range 5.5 8.0. highest
degree fusion ce erythrocytes observed ph 5.5, whereas chicken
erythrocytes fused ph 5.5-6.0 only. freezing thawing low-haemolytic
virus preparation increased erythrocyte fusion activity. ammonium chloride
did cause statistically significant effect multiplication virus
preparations expressing different haemolysis erythrocyte fusion activity.
