histamine release caused anti-ige examined leukocyte suspensions from
10 healthy individuals. influenza virus found enhance histamine
release release histamine per se. monoclonal antibodies directed
against viral neuraminidase included samples, potentiating
effect virus completely abolished. occurred using a
neuraminidase inhibitor. however, monoclonal antibodies directed the
viral haemagglutinin also abolished potentiation. binding virus the
basophil cell surface haemagglutinin therefore seems necessary the
viral neuraminidase cause potentiation mediator release.
