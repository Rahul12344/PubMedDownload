there increased incidence anal squamous carcinoma precursor
lesions (anal intraepithelial neoplasia [ain]) among persons engage in
anal-receptive sex. analogous cervical cancer screening, anal papanicplaou
(pap) smears currently used screen high-risk populations. human
papilloma virus (hpv) implicated anal carcinoma pathogenesis this
study performed assess potential role hpv dna testing adjunct
to anal cytology. correlated cytological diagnoses hpv dna (digene hybrid 
capture [hc ii] assay) anal specimens collected surepath liquid medium from
118 patients; 54.8% cases diagnosed atypical squamous cells undetermined
significance (asc-us) 87.8% diagnosed low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion (lsil) tested positive high- risk hpv dna (b+). high-grade
sil (hsil) present 31 51 patients follow-up. although a
cytological diagnosis asc-us reliable indicator ain,
cytology frequently accurately predict grade sil subsequent
biopsy. findings suggest reflex hpv dna testing would helpful in
triaging patients diagnosed asc-us. however, patients diagnosed lsil or
above go directly ansocopic biopsy.
