the annealing nucleic acids (partly) complementary rna dna strands is
involved important cellular processes. variety proteins shown
to accelerate rna/rna annealing mode action still mainly
uncertain. order study mechanism protein-facilitated acceleration of
annealing selected short peptide, hiv-1 tat(44-61), accelerates the
reaction efficiently. activity peptide strongly regulated mono- 
and divalent cations hints importance electrostatic interactions 
between rna peptide. mutagenesis peptide illustrated dominant role
of positively charged amino acids rna annealing--both overall charge of
the molecule precise distribution basic amino acids within peptide
are important. additionally, found tat(44-61) drives rna annealing
reaction via entropic rather enthalpic terms. one-dimensional-nmr data
suggest peptide changes population distribution possible rna
structures favor annealing-prone rna conformation, thereby increasing the
fraction colliding rna molecules successfully anneal.
