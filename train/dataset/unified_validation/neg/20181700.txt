human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection shown activate mtorc1
signaling pathway. however, phosphorylation mtorc1 targets is
differentially sensitive mtorc1 inhibitor rapamycin, drug inhibits
hcmv replication modest extent. using torin1, newly developed inhibitor
that targets catalytic site mtor kinase, show hcmv replication
requires rapamycin-sensitive rapamycin-resistant mtor activity. the
treatment infected cells torin1 inhibits phosphorylation of
rapamycin-sensitive rapamycin-resistant mtor targets markedly blocks 
production virus progeny. blockade mtor signaling torin1, 
rapamycin, disrupts assembly eif4f complex increases the
association translational repressor 4ebp1 7-methylguanosine
cap-binding complex. torin1 affect hcmv entry modestly reduces 
the accumulation immediate-early early viral proteins tested
despite disruption eif4f complex. contrast, torin1 significantly
decreases accumulation viral dna pul99 viral late protein. similar
mtor signaling events observed murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv)
infection, utilized murine fibroblasts containing several different
mutations dissect mechanism torin1 inhibits mcmv replication.
this approach demonstrated mtorc2 akt1 akt2 kinases not
required torin1-mediated inhibition cytomegalovirus replication. the
inhibition mcmv replication torin1 rescued cells lacking 4ebp1,
demonstrating inactivation 4ebp1 mtorc1 critical for
cytomegalovirus replication. finally, show torin1 inhibits the
replication representative members alpha-, beta-, gammaherpesvirus 
families, demonstrating potential mtor kinase inhibitors broad-spectrum
antiviral agents.
