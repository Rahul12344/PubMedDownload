the health survival managed honey bee (apis mellifera) colonies are
affected multiple factors, one important interaction
between viral pathogens infestations ectoparasitic mite varroa
destructor. currently, effective strategy available mitigating the
impact viral infections chemical control mite populations.
unfortunately, use in-hive acaricides comes price, can
produce sublethal effects difficult quantify, may ultimately be
as damaging mites used treat. goal study to
investigate physiological immunological effects formamidine
acaricide amitraz primary metabolite honey bees. using flock house
virus model viral infection, study found exposure a
formamidine acaricide may negative impact ability honey bees 
tolerate viral infection. furthermore, work demonstrated amitraz
and metabolite significantly alter honey bee cardiac function, likely
through interaction octopamine receptors. results suggest potential
drawback in-hive use amitraz raise intriguing questions the
relationship insect cardiac function disease tolerance.
