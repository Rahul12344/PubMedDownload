interactions tritium-labeled antiviral preparation remantadine with
nucleoids ribonucleoprotein (rnp) influenza virus studied. the
studies carried vivo, infected cells, vitro upon
direct contact preparation subviral structures isolated the
infected cell virions. autoradiography cells treated with
3h-remantadine showed association nuclei (possibly nuclear
membranes). analysis results gradient centrifugation showed
remantadine bind virus nucleoids vivo vitro without interacting
directly rnp. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis viral proteins revealed 
association remantadine matrix protein. nucleoids isolated a
remantadine-resistant virus variant bound much less remantadine a
sensitive variant. suggestions kind interaction leading the
formation stable associations made. also suggested that
remantadine prevents m-protein interaction cell membranes (probably, with
the nuclear membrane) thereby blocking "uncoating". rnp not
released m-protein layer penetrate nucleus, the
nuclear stage virus reproduction shut down.
