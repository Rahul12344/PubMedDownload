the current knowledge early innate immune responses mucosal sites of
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) entry limited likely important in
the design effective hiv vaccines heterosexual transmission. this
study examined temporal anatomic relationship virus replication, 
lymphocyte depletion, cytokine gene expression levels mucosal lymphoid
tissues vaginal-transmission model hiv rhesus macaques. results of
the study show kinetics cytokine gene expression levels acute 
phase infection positively correlated virus replication tissue. 
thus, cytokine responses vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)
inoculation earliest strongest mucosal tissues genital tract
and lowest systemic lymphoid tissues. importantly, early cytokine response
was dominated induction proinflammatory cytokines, induction 
of cytokines antiviral activity, alpha/beta interferon, occurred late to
prevent virus replication dissemination. thus, early cytokine response
favors immune activation, resulting recruitment potential target cells 
for siv. further, unique cytokine gene expression patterns observed in
distinct anatomic locations rapid persistent inflammatory response 
the gut consistent gut major site early cd4 t-cell 
depletion siv infection.
