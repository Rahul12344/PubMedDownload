the kinetics rotavirus specific cell mediated immunity rotavirus infection
were compared infected uninfected inbred balb-c mice. lymphocytes
transformation (ltf) spleen cells exposed varying doses mouse rotavirus 
(mrv) control antigens carried intervals 60 days following
infection. rotavirus infection monitored detection rotavirus
antigen isolated small intestinal enterocytes using direct immunofluorescent
assay. severity diarrhea determined consistency feces
and amount staining. length diarrhea also recorded. greater
than 50% enterocytes positive viral antigen 24 hours. number
of positive cells decreased following 7 days negative 8
days. diarrhea began approximately 44 48 hours inoculation continued
for 5 6 days terminating within 24 hours end detection 
viral antigen. viral specific cmi activity appeared splenic lymphocytes as
early two days infection peaked around ten days post infection. this
peak activity closely followed termination diarrhea. increase in
specific cmi simultaneously cessation virus replication suggests that
cellular immunity may function limiting factor disease.
