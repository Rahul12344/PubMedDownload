during viral infection, inflammation recovery tightly controlled by
competing proinflammatory regulatory immune pathways. respiratory syncytial
virus (rsv) leading global cause infantile bronchiolitis, is
associated recurrent wheeze asthma diagnosis later life. th2-driven
disease well described conditions rsv-infected mice. in
the present studies, used foxp3(dtr) mice (which allow specific
conditional depletion foxp3(+) cells) investigate functional effects 
of regulatory cells (tregs) a2-strain rsv infection. infected
treg-depleted mice lost significantly weight wild-type mice, indicating
enhanced disease. enhancement characterized increased cellularity 
the bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid notable lung eosinophilia seen 
control mice. accompanied abundant cd4(+) cd8(+) cells
exhibiting activated phenotype induction interleukin 13 (il-13)- and
gata3-expressing th2-type cd4(+) cells remained present airways
even 14 days infection. therefore, treg cells perform vital
anti-inflammatory functions rsv infection, suppressing pathogenic cell
responses inhibiting lung eosinophilia. findings provide additional
evidence dysregulation normal immune responses viral infection may
contribute severe rsv disease.
