lamivudine given orally dose 100 mg od 52 weeks. second liver
biopsy taken comparison end week 52. blinded biopsies were

activity index (hai).
results: ninety-five percent (19/20) patients reduction hepatic
necroinflammatory hai score (components 1 3) > =2 points end
of 52 weeks lamivudine therapy compared pretreatment values. only
were improvements necroinflammatory activity observed, 7/20 (35%) of
