permanent cell lines quail embryo fibroblasts appear cultures cells
infected wild type strain rous sarcoma virus (sr-rsv) its
temperature sensitive transformation mutants (ts-t) (nyts68 pa101) following 
a three step process. step one, infected cells grow twice fast the
control. second step consists crisis cell population is
stationary four five weeks. towards fourth week several foci cell
growth observed flasks. respreading content flasks
yields permanent lines. constitutes third step population
evolution. step one growth rate infected cells same
irrespective incubation temperature (36 degrees c 41 degrees c) whereas
the level pp60v-src activity considerably depressed 41 degrees c for
nyts68 pa101. foci appear restrictive temperature ts
infected population permanent lines recovered condition.
these lines grow ony 36 degrees c. shown virus they
produce modified respect temperature sensitivity src
gene expression since newly infected fibroblasts grow equally well step one at
both 36 degrees c 41 degrees c, stop number of
generations. finding suggests events which, crisis
period, lead establishment permanent lines, take place cellular 
level depend activity pp60v-src protein occurrence or
their expression.
