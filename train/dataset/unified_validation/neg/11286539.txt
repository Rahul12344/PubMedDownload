the ability il-2 induce expansion cd4(+) lymphocyte pool made 
it studied cytokine treatment hiv infection. majority of
trials used empirical regimen 5-day il-2 cycles given every 8 weeks--a
regimen based upon early pharmacodynamic studies patient preference. to
better define optimal duration frequency cycles, randomized trial was
conducted patients received "standard" regimen compared to
patients received cycles variable duration (based individual patterns
of cell cycle progression) patients received cycles variable
frequency (based individual cd4(+) lymphocyte responses previous cycles).
twenty-two patients hiv-1 infection cd4(+) lymphocyte counts > 200
cells/mm(3) randomized one three treatment groups 32 weeks of
study. eight participants received four 5-day il-2 cycles (controls) every 8
weeks; 7 participants received four cycles longer duration (mean 7.7-days);
and 7 participants received increased frequency 5-day cycles (every 4.1
weeks average). three groups experienced significant increases mean
cd4(+) lymphocytes. however, statistically significant
differences cd4(+) lymphocyte increases group received
longer cycles (median increase 239 cells/mm(3), p = 0.78) group
that received frequent cycles (median increase 511 cells/mm(3), p = 0.54)
and control group (median 284 cells/mm(3)). hiv-1 viral loads decreased
during study period three groups. inability demonstrate a
significant advantage increased frequency duration il-2 administration
provides corroborating experimental evidence use il-2 regimen
consisting 5-day cycles administered frequently every 8 weeks 
future clinical trials aimed expanding cd4(+) lymphocyte pool.
