we use data serial passage co-occluded recombinant autographa
californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (acmnpv) estimate viral
multiplicity infection cells within infected insects. co-occlusion, the
incorporation wild-type mutant virus genomes occlusion body,
has proposed strategy deliver genetically modified viruses as
insecticides way contains spread environment. may also 
serve means whereby naturally occurring mutant forms npvs be
maintained stable polymorphism. here, recombinant strain acmnpv was
constructed deletion polyhedrin gene, rendering incapable of
producing occlusion bodies (i.e., occlusion negative). co-occluded 
wild-type acmnpv used infect fifth-instar trichoplusia ni larvae. fate
of genotypes monitored several rounds insect infection. levels
of occlusion-negative virus genome declined slowly successive rounds 
infection. applied data model npv population genetics derive 
an estimate 4.3 +/- 0.3 viral genomes per occlusion body-producing cell.
