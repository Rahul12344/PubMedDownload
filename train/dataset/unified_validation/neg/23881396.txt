stripe rust, caused puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (pst), one the
most serious diseases wheat; therefore, exploring effective resistance-related
genes critical breeding studying resistance mechanisms. however, 
a stripe rust resistance genes defence-related genes cloned.
moreover, transgenic wheat enhanced stripe rust resistance rarely been
reported. receptor-like proteins (rlps) known involved defence and
developmental pathways. research, novel rlp gene tarlp1.1 was
characterized important stripe rust defence gene. tarlp1.1 screened 
genechip found induced pst specifically resistant
variety. knock tarlp1.1 stripe rust-resistant plants resulted in
increased susceptibility pst, phenolic autofluorogen accumulation the
pathogen-host interaction sites, usually correlated hypersensitive
response, decreased dramatically. however, tarlp1.1 gene was
transformed susceptible wheat variety yangmai158, transgenic plants 
showed highly increased resistance pst, hypersensitive response was
enhanced infection sites. meanwhile, expression of
pathogenesis-related genes decreased tarlp1.1-silenced plants and
increased tarlp1.1-overexpressing plants. thus, proposed that
tarlp1.1 greatly contributed hypersensitive response the
pathogen-host interaction. along functional analysis, evolutionary
study tarlp1 family performed. characterization tarlp1.1 may
facilitate breeding stripe rust resistance better understanding the
evolution rlp genes wheat.
