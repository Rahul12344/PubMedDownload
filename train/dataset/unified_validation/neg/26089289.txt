the highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza virus one greatest influenza
pandemic threats since 2003. association receptor binding domain (rbd)
with virulence influenza virus rarely addressed, particularly h5n1
influenza viruses. study, balb/c mice intranasally infected with
a/vietnam/1194/2004 (vn1194, h5n1). mouse lung-adapted variants isolated
and mutation e190g (h3 numbering) rbd recognized. the
recombinant virus, rvn-e190g carrying e190g hemagglutinin (ha) designed
and rescued using reverse genetics techniques. receptor binding activity,
growth curve pathogenicity mice rvn-e190g investigated.
results demonstrated rvn-e190g virus increased binding avidity α2,6
sa (sialic acid) reduced affinity α2,3 sa, meanwhile weakened the
viral replication vitro. moreover, virulence assessment demonstrated 
rvn-e190g attenuated mice. results indicated mutation e190g
in ha decreases h5n1 viral replication vitro significantly attenuates
virulence vivo. findings identify one determinants rbd which
can associated h5n1 virulence mice.
