long-term survival human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection has
been noted rare cohorts individuals infected nef-deleted virus.
enhanced macrophage tropism cytopathicity contribute pathogenicity wild
type hiv-1. better understand pathogenesis nef-deleted hiv-1, we
analyzed replication capacity macrophage cytopathicity nef-deleted
hiv-1 isolated sequentially long-term survivor progression aids 
(n=6 isolates). compared controls, nef-deleted viruses replicated low
levels peripheral blood mononu-clear cells monocyte-derived macrophages
(mdm). one nef-deleted virus isolated development aids caused 
high levels syncytia mdm similar control viruses, five viruses
isolated earlier times prior aids onset caused minimal
cytopathicity. together, results suggest enhanced cytopathicity of
nef-deleted hiv-1 mdm occur independently replication capacity, and
may contribute pathogenesis nef-deleted hiv-1 infection.
