antipathogen immune responses create balance immunity, tolerance, and
immune evasion. however, gene therapy viral vectors delivered 
substantial doses incapable expressing gene products reduce the
host's ability detect transduced cells. gene transfer efficacy also
modified vivo transduction dendritic cells (dc), notably
increases immunogenicity virions vector-encoded genes. study, 
we evaluated parameters relevant use canine adenovirus
serotype 2 (cav-2) vectors clinical setting assaying effect on
human monocyte-derived dc (hmodc). compared cav-2 human adenovirus (had)
vectors containing wild-type virion, functional deletions penton base 
rgd motif, cav-2 fiber knob. contrast type 5 (had5)-based
vectors, cav-2 poorly transduced hmodc, provoked minimal upregulation major
histocompatibility complex class i/ii costimulatory molecules (cd40, cd80,
and cd86), induced negligible morphological changes indicative dc
maturation. functional maturation assay results (e.g., reduced antigen uptake;
tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta [il-1beta], gamma interferon
[ifn-gamma], il-10, il-12, ifn-alpha/beta secretion; stimulation of
heterologous t-cell proliferation) also significantly lower cav-2. our
data suggested due, part, use alternative receptor 
and block vesicular escape. additionally, had5 vector-induced hmodc
maturation independent aforementioned cytokines. paradoxically, an
had5/cav-2 hybrid vector induced greatest phenotypical functional
maturation hmodc. data suggest cav-2 had5/cav-2 vector may be
the antithesis adenoviridae immunogenicity may specific
clinical advantages.
