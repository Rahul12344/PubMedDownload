the aim study develop test multivalent subunit vaccine
against bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) based e2 virus glycoprotein
belonging genotypes 1a, 1b 2a, immunopotentiated targeting these
antigens antigen-presenting cells. e2 antigens expressed insect
cells baculovirus vector fusion proteins single chain antibody,
named apch i, recognizes β-chain mhc class ii antigen. three
chimeric proteins evaluated immunogenicity guinea pig model
as well colostrum-deprived calves. immune response in
experimentally vaccinated calves evaluated, immunized animals challenged
with type 1b type 2b bvdv order study protection conferred the
experimental vaccine. recombinant apch i-te21a-1b-2a vaccine immunogenic 
both guinea pigs calves, inducing neutralizing antibodies. bvdv type
1b type 2 challenge vaccinated calves proof concept, type 1b
virus could isolated animal; meanwhile detected all
challenged non-vaccinated control animals. however, type 2 bvdv isolated 
to lesser extent compared unvaccinated animals challenged type 2 bvdv. 
clinical signs associated bvdv, hyperthermia leukopenia reduced 
respect controls vaccinated calves. given results, this
multivalent vaccine holds promise safe effective tool control bvdv
in herds.
