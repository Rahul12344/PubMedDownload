the metabolic fate 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-[(e)-2-bromovinyl]uracil
(bv-arau) herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells studied using
tritium-labeled bv-arau. [3h]bv-arau selectively taken-up infected cells. 
approximately 10% total uptake [3h]bv-arau recovered the
acid-insoluble fraction time post-infection. cellular uptake of
[3h]bv-arau incorporation acid-insoluble fraction increased with
increasing incubation time 8 hr post-infection. uptake [3h]bv-arau and
its incorporation acid-insoluble fraction also increased proportionally 
to duration exposure [3h]bv-arau. alkaline sucrose gradient
sedimentation analysis revealed radioactive dna obtained cells
pulse-labeled [3h]bv-arau small dna fragments remained top
following chasing period isotope-free medium, whereas pulse-labeled
with [3h]thymidine chased fraction high molecular weight dna.
nuclease p1 digestion reduced 99% [3h]bv-arau-labeled dna extracted from
infected cells low molecular weight. following digestion of
[3h]bv-arau-labeled dna micrococcal nuclease spleen exonuclease, 
the radioactivity recovered [3h]bv-arau 3'-monophosphate. thus, bv-arau
strongly inhibits elongation viral dna strands demonstrated the
alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, whereas least portion of
the [3h]bv-arau incorporated inside viral dna strands infected cells.
