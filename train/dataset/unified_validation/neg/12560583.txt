the genetic diversity australian bat lyssavirus (abl) investigated by
comparing 24 abl isolate glycoprotein (g) gene nucleotide sequences of
37 lyssaviruses representing lyssavirus genotypes 1-6. phylogenetic analyses
indicated abl forms monophyletic group separate lyssaviruses.
this group differentiates two clades: one associated pteropus (flying
fox) species, insectivorous bat saccolaimus flaviventris.
calculation percentage nucleotide identities isolates two
clades revealed 18.7 % nucleotide sequence divergence two abl
variants. observations suggest abl separate lyssavirus species
with similar epidemiology chiropteran rabies virus (rv), two distinct 
abl variants co-exist australia bat species dissimilar ecology.
analyses selection pressures abl g gene sequences provided evidence of
weak positive selection within endodomain amino acids 499 501,
although general dominant evolutionary process observed purifying
selection. intimates that, nature, isolates abl, like rv, are
subject relatively strong selective constraints, suggesting stability of
host species, cell tropisms ecological conditions.
