the treatment epstein-barr virus (ebv)-related post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disease (ptld) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(hsct) still unsatisfactory. conducted prospective trial evaluate 
impact routine ebv surveillance preemptive treatment anti-cd20
monoclonal antibody rituximab development ptld pediatric recipients 
of extensively t-cell depleted hsct hla-haploidentical relative.
twenty-seven patients included surveillance program, 12 developed ebv
dna positivity, 8 12 presenting sustained viral dna levels requiring
treatment rituximab. treatment well tolerated, induced clearance 
ebv dna patients. however, 4/8 patients showed new increase ebv load,
coincident emergence cd20(-)/cd19(+) b cells peripheral blood,
accompanied overt ptld 3 patients. latter cleared ptld receiving 
donor ebv-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (ctls), persist remission 
median 30-month follow-up. ebv-specific t-cell frequency, undetectable time of
ebv dna positivity, restored t-cell therapy levels comparable with
controls. conclude preemptive therapy rituximab safe, only
partly effective haplo-hsct recipients. patients progress ptld under
rituximab treatment rescued permanently infusion ebv-specific ctls.
