comparative nucleotide sequence studies 2.4-kb cdna fragment (nt -49 to
2361) korean-type hepatitis c virus (hcv) carried out. nt sequences
of korean hcv isolates stronger sequence homologies type ii hcv
(japanese hcv-bk) types (hcv-1) iii (hcv-6). addition, net 
sequences part core region ten different samples confirmed that
prevalent hcv korea belongs type ii exception one sample 
belongs type iii. nt sequence cdna fragment e2/ns1 region hcv, 
from six different serum samples, comprises hypervariable regions-1
(hvr-1) -2 (hvr-2), revealed sequence heterogeneity type ii hcv (75.4 to
80.7% nt homology 75.5 79.7% amino acid homology). however, was
relatively well conserved among korean isolates, fact, aa sequences of
hvr-2 well hvr-1, converged two groups. also found consensus
sequences (t.v.g..agrtt.g..sle......k) hvr-1. thus, propose the
conserved patterns hvr-1 -2 characteristics six different
korean isolates.
