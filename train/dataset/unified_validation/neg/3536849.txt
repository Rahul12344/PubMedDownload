new locus (ttr) escherichia coli k-12 affecting sensitivity bacteriophage
t2 growth oleate sole carbon source.

morona r, henning u.

the nature resistance phage t2 escherichia coli k-12 investigated by
analyzing known phage t2-resistant mutant isolating new t2-resistant
mutants. found mutational alterations two loci, ompf (encoding the
outer membrane protein ompf) ttr (t-two resistance), needed give full 
resistance phage t2. ttr::tn10 mutation isolated mapped 
aroc dsda, fadl gene (required long-chain fatty acid transport)
is located. receptor affected ttr major receptor used phage t2 
and located outer membrane. phage t2 thus able use two outer
membrane proteins receptors. strains ttr::tn10 allele of
the independently isolated phage t2-resistant mutants unable grow on
oleate sole carbon energy source, i.e., phenotype fadl
mutants. gene fadl known encode inner membrane protein. most
likely explanation fadl ttr operon ttr encodes 
outer membrane protein functions translocating long-chain fatty acids
across outer membrane also receptor phage t2.
