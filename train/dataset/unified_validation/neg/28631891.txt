aim: saliva play important role human herpesvirus-8 (hhv-8)
transmission endemic regions kaposi's sarcoma (ks). little known 
hhv-8 oral shedding immunocompetent individuals non-endemic regions for
ks.
methods: conducted prospective study hhv-8 salivary excretion among 59
healthy, immunocompetent individuals são paulo, brazil, followed weekly
for 4 months, resulting 16 saliva samples participant. antibodies to
hhv-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) lytic-phase antigens were
investigated immunofluorescence assays (ifa). hhv-8 dna detection was
performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
results: 59 individuals seronegative lana lytic antibodies. hhv-8
dna undetectable saliva samples 100% participants, totaling 944 
samples consistently negative different periods sampling,
which lasted approximately 120 days. sequences hhv-8 dna detected in
the saliva samples healthy, immunocompetent adults using real-time pcr,
with resulting data consistent ifa-based serological tests.
conclusions: unlike herpesviruses, hhv-8 excreted saliva of
healthy individuals non-endemic regions ks.
