background aims: hemochromatosis iron overload screening (heirs)
study screened 101,168 primary care participants iron overload serum
transferrin saturation (ts), ferritin, c282y h63d mutations hfe
gene.
methods: c282y homozygotes participants increased ts (>45% women,
>50% men) serum ferritin level (> 200 microg/l women, >300 microg/l men) were
recalled clinical history physical examination, blood tests
including alanine transaminase (alt) aspartate transaminase levels. hepatitis
b surface antigen anti-hepatitis c virus measured alt level was
increased (>31 iu/l women, >40 iu/l men).
results: group participants selected return clinical examination
because increased ts ferritin levels, alt increases anti-hepatitis c
virus found 95 284 (33%) african americans, 50 466 (11%) asian 
pacific islanders, 21 120 (18%) hispanics, 40 477 (8.4%) caucasians.
alt increases hepatitis b surface antigen detected 24 466 (5%)
asian pacific islanders, 10 284 (3.5%) african americans, 3 120 (2.5%) 
hispanics, 2 477 (.42%) caucasians. 86 liver biopsy specimens obtained 
for clinical purposes, 53 reviewed single study pathologist. liver
fibrosis (stage 3 4) present 2 11 (18.2%) c282y homozygotes that
underwent central review 2 302 (.66%) c282y homozygotes attending the
clinical examination.
conclusions: screening iron overload ferritin ts detects persons
with viral hepatitis types liver disease. minimum .66% c282y
homozygotes liver fibrosis.
