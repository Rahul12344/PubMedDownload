long-term persistence cell-mediated humoral immune response in
specifically resistant mice given live attenuated langat (e5 "14") virus.

in long-term experiment, features humoral cell-mediated immunity
(cmi) investigated mice given intravenously (i.v.) single dose live 
attenuated langat (e5 "14") virus tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) complex.

inoculation (p.i.), persisting least 15 months. specific virus
neutralizing (vn) antibodies detected pooled serum mice 4th
