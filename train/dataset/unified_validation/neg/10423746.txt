in order compare hiv-1 p24 antigenemia plasma hiv-1 rna levels markers 
of viral replication, 3,129 paired determinations alkaline
immunocomplex-dissociated serum hiv-1 p24 antigenemia (performed an
immunoenzymatic assay), plasma hiv-1 rna levels (carried branched 
dna method, reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction, a
nucleic acid sequence-based assay) assessed two-year-period. when
excluding samples undetectable plasma hiv-1 rna levels (which tested
negative borderline positive serum p24 antigen assay 97.9% cases),
immunocomplex-dissociated p24 antigenemia proved significantly less sensitive
than viral load considered hiv-1 rna reference levels, although the
profile positive serum p24 antigen assays (values 10 pg/ml) paralleled
the trend plasma hiv-1 viral load, especially higher levels. however, serum
hiv-1 p24 antigenemia (even immunocomplex dissociation) longer
suggested sole virological tool laboratory management hiv-1
infection, due significantly lower sensitivity levels compared viral 
load assessment.
