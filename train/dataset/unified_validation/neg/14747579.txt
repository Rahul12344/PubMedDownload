distamycin described inhibitor cellular pathogenesis of
vaccinia virus culture. distamycin antibiotic specifically targets 
the minor groove dna. show distamycin potent inhibitor of
vaccinia virus replication. pulse-labeling experiments showed major
late proteins failed accumulate presence antibiotic. we
characterized effect distamycin vaccinia virus nucleic acid
biosynthesis goal determining inhibitor's target. early gene
transcription unaffected. dna synthesis proceeded normal rates, dna
accumulated large masses cytoplasm evidence virion assembly.
transcription intermediate class promoter i1l gene partially
reduced distamycin; however, transcription intermediate promoters for
the three late transcription factor genes severely inhibited. the
accumulation late transcripts viral f17r a10l genes also was
severely impaired shown direct inhibition late promoter
activity. results indicate inhibition postreplicative intermediate 
and late transcription basis inhibition vaccinia virus by
distamycin indicate dna minor-groove ligands hold promise effective 
anti-poxvirus drugs.
