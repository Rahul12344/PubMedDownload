salmonella-spedfic bacteriophages (bp) competitive exclusion (ce) used
to reduce salmonella colonization experimentally infected chickens. a
"cocktail" distinct phage (i.e., phage showing different host ranges and
inducing different types plaques salmonella typhimurium [st] cultures) 
developed. killing activity selected bps st cultures differed
significantly, determined vitro killing assays. bps administered
orally chickens several days prior st challenge not
simultaneously. bps readily isolated feces bp-treated
chickens approximately 48 hr administration. ce product consisting a
defined culture seven different microbial species used either alone 
combination bp treatment. ce administered orally hatch. salmonella
counts intestine, ceca, pool liver/spleen evaluated in
salmonella-challenged chickens treated bp bp ce. trials

was evident. reduction salmonella counts detected cecum ileum 
bp-, ce-, bp+ce-treated chickens compared nontreated birds. trial

counts sixfold ceca. reduction salmonella counts bp, ce, and
bp+ce treatments evident chickens trial 2. ce bp treatments 
showed differences reduction salmonella counts challenge 
spedmens obtained days 4 14 postchallenge ceca, liver/spleen, and
ileum. preliminary data presented report show isolation and
characterization salmonella-specific bp uncomplicated feasible a

bps defined competitive exclusion product salmonella colonization
of experimentally infected chickens. results encouraging further
work use bp effective alternative antibiotics reduce
salmonella infections poultry.
