prohormones directed trans-golgi network secretory granules of
the regulated secretory pathway. proposed prohormone
conversion endoproteolysis may necessary subsequent retention of
peptides granules prevent release so-called
"constitutive-like" pathway. address directly, mutant human proinsulin
(arg/gly(32):lys/thr(64)), cannot cleaved conversion endoproteases,
was expressed primary rat islet cells recombinant adenovirus. handling 
of mutant proinsulin compared wild-type human proinsulin.
infected islet cells pulse labeled basal stimulated secretion
of radiolabeled products followed chase. labeled products were
quantified high-performance liquid chromatography. expected, mutant
proinsulin converted time. basal (constitutive and
constitutive-like) secretion higher mutant proinsulin for
wild-type proinsulin/insulin, amounted <1% even prolonged (6-h)
period basal chase. difference stimulated (regulated)
secretion mutant wild-type proinsulin/insulin time. thus, in
primary islet cells, unprocessed (mutant) proinsulin sorted regulated
pathway retained secretory granules efficiently fully processed
insulin.
