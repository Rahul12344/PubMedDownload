kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes two related proteins, mir1 and
mir2, lead reduction cell surface levels major
histocompatibility complex class polypeptides involved immune
recognition. mir1 mir2 affect assembly transport their
target proteins secretory pathway; rather, act enhance the
selective endocytosis target chains cell surface. sequence inspection
reveals modulator immune recognition (mir) proteins contain an
nh(2)-terminal zinc finger plant homeodomain (phd) subfamily, two
transmembrane (tm) domains, c-terminal conserved region (cr). we
examine transmembrane topology functional organization mir2. 
phd domain cr disposed cytosolically essential for
mir-mediated endocytosis. mir proteins form homo-oligomers; activity is
independent phd cr elements maps instead tm regions.
analysis chimeras mir1 mir2 reveals tm regions also
mediate target selectivity. mutations ablate phd cr regions generate 
dominant negative phenotypes major histocompatibility complex class i
endocytosis. findings suggest domain organization mir proteins,
with tm regions involved target selection cytosolic phd cr
domains involved possible recruitment cellular machinery directly 
or indirectly regulates internalization target molecules.
