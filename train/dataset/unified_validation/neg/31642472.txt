studies suggest inflammation might involved pathogenesis of
depression. individuals human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) higher
risk depression elevated inflammatory profiles. despite this, research 
the link inflammation depression among high-risk population is
limited. examined sample men sex men multicenter
aids cohort study prospective analyses association inflammation
and clinically relevant depression symptoms, defined scores >20 center 
epidemiological studies depression scale. included 1,727 participants who
contributed 9,287 person-visits 1984 2010 (8,218 hiv (hiv+) and
1,069 without (hiv-)). exploratory factor analysis (efa) used characterize
underlying inflammatory processes 19 immune markers. logistic regression
with generalized estimating equations used evaluate associations between
inflammatory processes depressive symptoms stratified hiv serostatus.
three efa-identified inflammatory processes (eips) identified. eip-1

interleukin-2 receptor α (sil-2rα), scd27, b-cell activating factor, interferon
γ-induced protein 10 (ip-10), soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sil-6r), scd14, and
sgp130-were significantly associated 9% higher odds depressive symptoms
in hiv+ participants (odds ratio = 1.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.16) and
33% higher odds hiv- participants (odds ratio = 1.33; 95% confidence interval:
1.09, 1.61). findings suggest immune activation might involved in
depression risk among hiv+ hiv- men sex men.
