background: spread influenza viruses community influenced by
several factors, reports focused relationship the
incidence influenza characteristics small neighborhoods community.
we aimed clarify relationship incidence influenza and
neighborhood characteristics using gis identified type small areas
where influenza occurs frequently infrequently.
methods: 19,077 registered influenza cases, analyzed 11,437 influenza a
and 5,193 influenza b cases diagnosed rapid antigen test in
66-86 medical facilities isahaya city, japan, 2004 2008. used the
commercial geodemographics dataset, mosaic japan categorize classify 
neighborhood. furthermore, calculated index value influenza crude
and age adjusted rates evaluate incidence influenza mosaic
segmentation. additional age structure analysis performed geodemographics 
segmentation explore relationship influenza family structure.
results: observed number influenza b patients neighborhoods
where young couples small children lived approximately 10-40% higher
than expected number (p < 0.01) seasons. contrary, the
number patients neighborhoods aging society rural area 
20-50% lower expected number (p < 0.01) seasons. this
tendency consistent age adjustment except case influenza b,
which lost significance higher incidence areas, overall results
indicated high transmission influenza areas young families with
children lived.
conclusions: analysis indicated incidence influenza b in
neighborhood groups related family structure, especially presence
of children households. simple statistical analysis geodemographics data is
an effective method understand differences incidence influenza
among neighborhood groups, provides valuable basis community
strategies control influenza.
