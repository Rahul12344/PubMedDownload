an influenza virus (h7n9) anti-neuraminidase monoclonal antibody protects mice 
from morbidity without interfering development protective immunity to
subsequent homologous challenge.

the emergence a(h7n9) virus strains resistance neuraminidase (na)
inhibitors highlights critical need discover new countermeasures for
treatment a(h7n9) virus-infected patients. previously described anti-na 
mab (3c10-3) prophylactic therapeutic efficacy mice lethally
challenged a(h7n9) virus delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.). we
show intrananasal (i.n.) administration 3c10-3 protects 100% mice from
mortality treated 24h post-challenge characterize protective
efficacy 3c10-3 using nonlethal a(h7n9) challenge model. administration of
3c10-3 i.p. 24h prior challenge resulted significant decrease viral
lung titers deep sequencing analysis indicated treatment not
consistently select viral variants na. furthermore, prophylactic
administration 3c10-3 inhibit development protective immunity
to subsequent homologous virus re-challenge. taken together, 3c10-3 highlights
the potential use anti-na mab mitigate influenza virus infection.
