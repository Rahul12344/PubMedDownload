the modes evolution proteins potato virus investigated a
maximum-likelihood method based estimation ratio non-synonymous
and synonymous substitution rates. evidence diversifying selection was
obtained 6k2 protein (one amino acid position) coat protein (24 amino
acid positions). amino acid sites coat proteins potyviruses (bean
yellow mosaic virus, yam mosaic virus) also found diversifying
selection. sites belonged n-terminal domain, exposed 
to exterior virion particle. several amino acid positions 
the coat proteins shared three potyviruses.
identification diversifying selection events different proteins 
help unravel biological functions essential understanding
of evolutionary constraints exerted potyvirus genome. hypothesis
of link evolutionary constraints due host plants occurrence of
diversifying selection discussed.
