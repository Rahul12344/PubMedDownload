because immune response hiv depends viral gene expression, examined 
the hiv-specific immune responses persons whose viral load highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart) <400 least 3 occasions 12-month
interval. eleven patients identified. little change mean 
hiv-binding antibody (ab) titers group, two persons mounted increases 
hiv envelope-specific binding antibody. neutralizing antibody (nab) titers
against panel hiv-1 primary isolates (bz167, us1, cm237) increased
post-haart (80% neutralization titer us1, p = 0.06; cm237, p =
0.04). two persons large increases binding antibody also had
increases primary isolate nab. roughly half haart recipients had
significant increases neutralizing antibody primary isolates us1 and
cm237. compared cd4-matched, non-haart controls, significant
increases nab subtype b primary isolate us1 (p < 0.0009); no
increases seen easily neutralized primary isolate bz167. 
were differences haart antibody-directed cellular cytotoxicity
(adcc). haart resulted partial restoration lymphoproliferative responses 
to recall antigens (tetanus diphtheria). new responses developed hiv gag
p24. patient responded hiv env gp160 gp120 either haart.
the data underscore lack functional reconstitution hiv-specific,
cd4-mediated responses despite durable suppression viral replication. the
setting stable anti-hiv ab levels, development increased nab certain
individuals suggests control virus haart may assist immune
control hiv.
