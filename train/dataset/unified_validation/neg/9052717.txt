to identify hla-dr-binding peptides within human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)-1 proteins. 95 overlapping synthetic peptides representing entire
sequence gp120-lai screened capacity bind two hla-dr
molecules distant sequences (dr0401 dr1101). using cell surface
competitive binding assay, 56 dr-binding peptides identified, 35
bound dr1101 dr0401. highly significant concordance evidenced
by statistical analysis binding peptides one dr
molecule, suggesting high proportion promiscuity among gp120 peptides, even 
though clear sequence pattern accounting promiscuity found.
dr-binding peptides located along entire gp120 sequence. yet, the
majority (42 among 56) concentrated seven multiagretopic regions 
that arbitrarily defined regions containing four overlapping
continuous peptides binding dr1011 and/or dr0401. good correlation found
between dr-binding regions dr-binding peptides defined study and
promiscuous helper gp120 epitopes previously described seropositive
individuals. results suggest identification multiagretopic 
dr-binding regions may great help predicition protein
determinants likelihood promiscuous helper epitopes in
humans.
