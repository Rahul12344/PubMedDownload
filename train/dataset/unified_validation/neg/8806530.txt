all primates studied date produce retroviral-like particles their
placentae. purified particles two primate species, one old
world (human) one new world (marmoset), identified retroviral
sequences packaged particles. three families sequences
have detected particles human, highest
homology b- d-type retroviruses human endogenous retrovirus
herv-k10. previous studies reported new world monkeys not
possess sequences homology herv-k10. identified new family of
low-copy-number sequences present new world monkeys which
possess 70% homology herv-k family. particles species possess
reverse transcriptase activity found retroviral
particles package sequences encode long open reading frames pol, as
revealed expression cloning escherichia coli. open reading frames
could encode reverse transcriptase enzyme activity found particles.
