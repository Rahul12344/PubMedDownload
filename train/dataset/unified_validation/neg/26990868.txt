background: causal interpretation cervical immune response human
papillomavirus (hpv) infection complex poorly characterized mainly due 
the delicate balance exists viral infection, increase of
inflammatory cytokines host risk factors. study aims explore the
significance cervical immune mediators associated cell survival,
angiogenesis interaction immune response, predicting risk to
develop hpv-related intraepithelial lesions.
methods: panel 48 cytokines growth factors explored selected
cohort 168 immunocompetent women including 88 diagnosed low (lsil) or
high (hsil) squamous intraepithelial lesions cervix 80 normal
cervical cytology (nil). hpv genotyping performed linear array hpv test
and soluble concentration 48 immune molecules analyzed using the
bio-plex platform.
results: prevalence single hr-hpv infection 30% nil 100% in
lsil hsil women. expression 13 cytokines, including interleukins il-6,
il-3, il-12p40, il-12p70, il-16, il-18, lif, chemokines ccl7 (mcp-3), cxcl9
(mig), cxcl12 (sdf-1Î±) tropic factors vegf, g-csf, m-csf were
significantly associated presence infection, levels higher
in women precancerous lesions compared nil hpv negative women. the
growth factor gm-csf positively associated cytological
abnormalities.
conclusions: ability hr-hpv escape innate immune recognition and
to orchestrate production specific inflammatory growth factors,
involved early inflammatory response cell-proliferating phase of
intraepithelial damage, documented women development of
cervical lesions.
