objective: evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacogenomics efavirenz
(efv) lopinavir/ritonavir (lpv/rtv) hiv-infected persons requiring
hemodialysis.
design: prospective, observational study hiv-infected hemodialysis patients
receiving one 600 mg tablet daily efv (n = 13) three 133.3/33.3 mg capsules
twice daily lpv/rtv (n = 13).
methods: twenty-four-hour efv 12-h lpv/rtv pharmacokinetics assessed.
geometric mean ratios calculated using historical controls normal renal
function. effects several candidate gene polymorphisms also explored.
results: geometric mean [95% confidence interval (ci); percentage of
coefficient variation (% cv)] cmin, cmax, area curve (auc) for
the efv group 1.81 microg/ml (0.93, 3.53; 103%), 5.04 microg/ml (3.48, 7.29;
72%), 71.5 microg h/ml (43.2, 118.3; 93%), respectively. parameters
were 2.76 microg/ml (1.86, 4.11; 53%), 8.45 microg/ml (6.41, 11.15; 52%), and
69.6 microg h/ml (55.6, 87.2; 37%) lpv 0.08 microg/ml (0.05, 0.14; 63%), 
0.58 microg/ml (0.44, 0.76; 41%), 3.74 microg h/ml (2.91, 4.80; 37%) rtv.
the auc geometric mean ratios (90% ci) efv, lpv, rtv 132% (89, 197),
81% (67, 97), 92% (76, 111), respectively. lpv cmin lower expected
in hemodialysis group. higher efv concentrations associated the
cyp2b6 516g>t polymorphism.
conclusion: pharmacokinetics efv lpv/rtv hemodialysis suggests that
no dosing adjustments necessary treatment-naive patients. hiv-infected 
hemodialysis patients disproportionately black, increased frequency of
the cyp2b6 516g>t polymorphism may lead higher efv levels. potentially
lower lpv trough levels population suggest lpv/rtv used
with caution protease-inhibitor-experienced patients.
