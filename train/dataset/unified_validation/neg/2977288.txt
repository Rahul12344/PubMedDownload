the resolution pulsed-field gel electrophoresis dramatically affected by
the number configuration electrodes used, alter the
shape applied electrical fields. present calculations and
experiments effect electrode position one commonly used 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis configurations. goal explore which
aspects electrical field shape correlate improved electrophoretic
resolution. critical variable appears angle the
alternate electrical fields. effective electrode configurations yield
angles 110 degrees. continually increasing angle the
fields produces band sharpening greatly enhances resolution.
