proportions lymphocyte subsets (okt3, okt4, okt8) expression of
interleukin-2 (il-2), transferrin (tfr) receptors hla-dr antigens were
studied peripheral blood 21 healthy hbsag carriers, 10 patients with
chronic active hepatitis b (cah), 10 patients alcoholic liver cirrhosis
(alc) 10 subjects negative markers previous hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection. lymphocyte subsets ranged within normal levels cah carriers, 
whereas significant decrease okt4 noted alc possibly involved 
pathogenesis disorder. significantly elevated numbers activated cells 
(cells expressing il-2, tfr receptors hla-dr antigens) observed all
three groups. significant increase okt8 cells within tfr population 
noted cah alc, whereas proportions subsets tfr population were
normal carriers. findings possibly suggest common pathogenetic
mechanism activation lymphocytes cah alc leading liver damage
and immune response hbv healthy carriers.
