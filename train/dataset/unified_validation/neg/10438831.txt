the parvovirus minute virus mice ns1 protein multifunctional protein
involved variety processes virus propagation, ranging viral
dna replication promoter regulation cytotoxic action host cell.
since ns1 becomes phosphorylated infection, proposed the
different tasks protein might regulated coordinated manner by
phosphorylation. indeed, comparing biochemical functions native ns1 its
dephosphorylated counterpart showed site-specific nicking origin 
the helicase atpase activities remarkably reduced upon ns1
dephosphorylation site-specific affinity protein origin
became enhanced. consequence, dephosphorylated polypeptide deficient 
for initiation dna replication. adding fractionated cell extracts a
kinase-free vitro replication system, combination two protein
components containing members protein kinase c (pkc) family found to
rescue replication activity dephosphorylated ns1 protein upon addition
of pkc cofactors. one components, termed ha-1, also stimulated ns1
helicase function response acidic lipids phorbol esters, indicating
the involvement atypical pkc isoforms modulation ns1 function

pkclambda/iota active component ha-1 responsible regulation 
ns1 dna unwinding replicative functions. moreover, target pkclambda
phosphorylation site localized s473 ns1. site-directed mutagenesis, 
we showed residue essential ns1 helicase activity not
promoter regulation, suggesting possible modulation ns1 functions by
pkclambda phosphorylation residue s473.
