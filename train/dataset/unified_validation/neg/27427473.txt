a molecular diagnostic assay utilizing reverse transcription-recombinase
polymerase amplification (rt-rpa) isothermal constant temperature 39°c
and target-specific primers probe developed rapid, sensitive,
and specific detection tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid (tcdvd) infected leaf 
and seed tissues. performance amplifyrp(®) acceler8™ rt-rpa diagnostic
assay, utilizing lateral flow strip contained within amplicon detection
chamber, evaluated results compared standard rt-pcr
assay. amplifyrp(®) acceler8™ assay specific tcdvd leaf seed
tissues, sensitivity comparable conventional rt-pcr leaf tissues,
and require extensive sample purification, specialized equipment, 
technical expertise. first report utilizing rt-rpa assay detect
viroids assay used laboratory field for
tcdvd detection.
