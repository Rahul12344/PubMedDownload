background: increased incidence posttransplant lymphoproliferative
disorders (ptld) result immunosuppression suggested combined 
heart-lung transplantation compared solid organ transplants, and
represents significant source morbidity mortality among lung transplant 
patients. although infection epstein-barr virus implicated in
the pathogenesis ptld, unclear ptld donor recipient
origin lung transplant patients.
methods: case histories histologic, immunophenotypic, molecular
genetic findings three patients developed ptld authors'
transplantation program presented.
results: three patients developed ptld b-cell immunophenotype two
patients evidence monoclonality southern blotting dna gene
rearrangement analysis. site involvement ptld lung two
patients small bowel third. one patient, two separate pulmonary
lesions found comprised distinct clonal populations, one exhibiting
kappa lambda light chain restriction different
immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements. epstein-barr virus genome was
present ptld three patients. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
amplification polymorphic huntington gene annexin iii locus used to
identify ptld three patients recipient origin.
conclusions: pcr amplification polymorphic genetic loci demonstrated the
recipient origin ptld three pulmonary transplant patients.
