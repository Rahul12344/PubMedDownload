to assess long-term hematologic renal effects associated solitary
kidney, 16 healthy cats undergoing uninephrectomy kidney donation may
1987 january 1991 evaluated use physical examination, cbc, serum
biochemical analysis, urinalysis, urine protein:creatinine ratio. results 
preoperative cbc, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis within
reference limits donors. median age surgery follow-up evaluation
was 34 72 months, respectively. mean (+/- sem) interval follow-up and
uninephrectomy 39.3 +/- 14.6 months. postuninephrectomy hematocrit rbc
indices within reference limits 15 donors. one cat chronic renal
insufficiency normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia. 15
clinically normal donor cats, mean (+/- sem) serum creatinine concentrations pre-
and post-uninephrectomy 1.36 +/- 0.20 1.71 +/- 0.33 mg/dl, respectively 
(p = 0.0002); however, clinical relevance statistical difference in
serum creatinine uncertain, values within reference limits.
in addition, urine-concentrating ability maintained 14 donors, urine 
specific gravity > = 1.040. two donors, including cat chronic renal
insufficiency, produced dilute urine (specific gravity < = 1.020) had
substantial proteinuria, urine protein:creatinine ratios 2.16 3.62,
respectively. mean urine protein:creatinine ratio donor cats not
significantly different age- sex-matched comparison group.
renal erythropoetic function clinically preserved group donor
cats within 2 5 years uninephrectomy.(abstract truncated 250 words)
