a major epidemic venezuelan equine encephalitis occurred south texas the
summer 1971. 1500 equines died vee texas, 110 human cases 
with deaths reported. vector studies south texas northern
tamaulipas revealed overall mosquito infection rates peak 
the epidemic 1:100, one highest rates observed major
epidemic. mosquito infection rates magnitude could easily explain the
intensity vee outbreaks equines man. total 943 vee virus
isolations made mosquitoes. eight 12 mosquito species found
infected implicated epidemic cycle vee first time.
sufficient laboratory field evidence available prove psorophora
confinnis one primary vectors vee. lack laboratory evidence 
necessitates use term "probable" primary vectors species
apparently equally involved basis field infections; include
aedes sollicitans, aedes thelcter psorophora discolor. eight species
from less 10 vee virus isolations made considered auxiliary 
vectors. mosquitoes species tested individually; tests showed
2-4% probable primary vectors infected. first isolation vee
virus epidemic made p. confinnis june 28, 1971. highest
mosquito infection rates occurred week july 5. mosquito infection
rates declined precipitously last 3 weeks july 1971, signaling end 
of epidemic study area. one explanation decline that
equines, principal epidemic hosts, eliminated source virus by
death acquisition natural induced immunity. mosquito control appeared
to effective reducing infected mosquito population the
immunization equines tc 83 vee vaccine accomplished. quarantines
appeared effective restricting vee virus activity south texas.
undoubtedly control measures contributed stopping epidemic.
continued vee surveillance various government agencies failed to
reveal epidemic vee activity us 1972. arboviruses
isolated vee studies south texas included st. louis encephalitis
virus, san angelo subtype california group. virus bunyamwera 
group also isolated palo blanco, tamaulipas.
