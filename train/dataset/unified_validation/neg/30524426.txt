current vaccine development disregards human immune ontogeny, relying animal
models select vaccine candidates targeting human infants, greatest 
risk infection worldwide, receive largest number vaccines. help 
accelerate de-risk development early-life effective immunization, we
engineered human age-specific microphysiologic vascular-interstitial
interphase, suitable pre-clinical modeling distinct age-targeted immunity 
in vitro. tissue constructs (tcs) enable autonomous extravasation of
monocytes undergo rapid self-directed differentiation migratory
dendritic cells (dcs) response adjuvants licensed vaccines as
bacille calmette-guérin (bcg) hepatitis b virus vaccine (hbv). tcs contain a
confluent human endothelium grown atop tri-dimensional human extracellular
matrix substrate, employ human age-specific monocytes autologous non
heat-treated plasma, avoid use xenogenic materials exogenous
cytokines. vaccine-pulsed tcs autonomously generated dcs induced
single-antigen recall responses autologous naïve memory cd4+ t
lymphocytes, matching study participant immune-status, including bcg responses
paralleling donor ppd status, bcg-induced adenosine deaminase (ada) activity
paralleling infant cohorts vivo, multi-dose hbv antigen-specific responses
as demonstrated lymphoproliferation tcr sequencing. overall, our
microphysiologic culture method reproduced age- antigen-specific recall
responses bcg hbv immunization, closely resembling observed 
birth immunization human cohorts vivo, offering first time new
approach early pre-clinical selection effective age-targeted vaccine
candidates.
