background: rotavirus associated acute infantile gastro-enteritis in
infants young children worldwide. rotavirus associated high cases
of morbidity mortality estimated 650,000 deaths young
children occur annually less developed countries. approximately quarter 
of deaths occur african children yet minimal data exist the
circulating rotavirus strains africa.
objective: characterise circulating rotavirus strains kenya.
design: prospective study investigate rotavirus infection infants and
young children acute diarrhoea different areas kenya. between
september 2001 february 2002, 119 faecal specimens collected from
children aged 1 60 months acute infantile gastro-enteritis.
setting: faecal samples collected clinics around nairobi its
suburbs including karen, ngong, ongata rongai.
subjects methods: faecal samples collected 119 infants young
children diarrhoea analysed commercial elisa polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (sds-page) identify possible non-group rotaviruses.
extraction potential rotavirus double-stranded rna faeces and
characterisation sds-page showed presence human group c rotaviruses.
results: examination samples commercial elisa assay the
presence group rotavirus antigen showed 13 specimens (11%) were
positive. analysis stool specimens performed polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis identify possible non-group rotaviruses. extraction any
potential rotavirus double-stranded rna faeces characterisation by
sds-page showed presence human group c rotaviruses.
conclusion: first report group c rotaviruses kenya. further
studies underway continue surveillance rotavirus strains kenya; 
as information useful planning rotavirus vaccine trials in
africa.
