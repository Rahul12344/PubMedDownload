hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection major cause liver-related morbidity and
mortality among thalassaemic patients. order analyse effect the
current anti-hcv treatment subset hcv-infected patients, conducted 
a systematic review meta-analysis available literature. outcome
was sustained viral response. comparative [odds ratio (or)] and
non-comparative indeces (success rate) used run meta-analytical
procedure. data encompassing 429 thalassaemic hcv-infected patients treated 
conventional pegylated interferon monotherapy combination therapy with
ribavirin collected 13 articles (10 prospective cohort studies, 1
randomized-controlled trial 2 controlled trials). pooled sustained
viralogical response (svr) 44.7% (34.6-54.9). pooled ors svr genotype 
1 vs non-genotype 1 infected thalassaemic patients 0.46 (95% ci: 0.22-0.95) 
in ifn monotherapy 1.7 (95% ci: 0.46-6.04) ribavirin combination therapy. 
our meta-analysis shows thalassaemic patients genotype 1 infection
significantly benefit addition ribavirin therapeutic
regimen. seems using ribavirin thalassaemic patients increases
transfusion need median 30-40%, increase major adverse
events treatment withdrawal. current literature lacking sufficient evidence
about use peg-ifn monotherapy combination ribavirin in
