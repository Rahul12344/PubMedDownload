the innate immune system provides first line host defense invading
pathogens. innate immune responses initiated germline-encoded prr, which
recognize specific structures expressed microorganisms. tlr family of
prr sense wide range microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi,
protozoa viruses. tlr also expressed intestine critical
for intestinal homeostasis. recently, cytoplasmic prr, nlr rlr, 
been shown detect pathogens invaded cytosol. one nlr,
nod2, thought involved pathogenesis crohn's disease. this
