background: bcg vaccination, combined adenoviral-delivered boosts,
represents reasonable strategy augment, broaden prolong immune
protection tuberculosis (tb). tested bcg (ssi1331) (in 6 animals,
delivered intradermally) recombinant (rbcg) afro-1 expressing
perfringolysin (in 6 animals) followed two boosts (delivered intramuscullary) 
with non-replicating adenovirus 35 (rad35) expressing fusion protein composed
of ag85a, ag85b tb10.4, capacity induce antigen-specific cellular 
immune responses rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta). control animals received
diluent (3 animals).
methods findings: cellular immune responses analyzed longitudinally (12 
blood draws animal) using intracellular cytokine staining (tnf-alpha,
il-2 ifn-gamma), cell proliferation measured cd4(+),
cd8alpha/beta(+), cd8alpha/alpha(+) cell subsets ifn-gamma production
was tested 7 day pbmc cultures (whole blood cell assay, wba) using ag85a,
ag85b, tb10.4 recombinant proteins, ppd bcg stimuli. animals primed with
afro-1 showed i) increased ag85b-specific ifn-gamma production wba assay
(median >400 pg/ml 6 animals) one week first boost with
adenoviral-delivered tb-antigens compared animals primed bcg (<200
pg/ml), ii) stronger cell proliferation cd8alpha/alpha(+) cell subset 
(proliferative index 17%) compared bcg-primed animals (proliferative index 
5% cd8alpha/alpha(+) cells). polyfunctional cells, defined ifn-gamma,
tnf-alpha il-2 production detected 2/6 animals primed afro-1
directed ag85a/b tb10.4; 4/6 animals primed bcg showed ag85a/b
responses, yet single animal exhibited ag85a/b tb10.4 reactivity.
conclusion: afro-1 induces qualitatively quantitatively different cellular
immune responses compared bcg rhesus macaques. increased
ifn-gamma-responses antigen-specific cell proliferation the
cd8alpha/alpha+ cell subset represents valuable marker vaccine-take in
bcg-based tb vaccine trials.
