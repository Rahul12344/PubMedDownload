little known stability human papillomavirus (hpv) rna within
cervical samples collected liquid based cytology (lbc) preservation media. 
addressed analysing patient lbc specimens presence hpv rna
over prospective time course. lbc samples preservcyt obtained from
seven women referred colposcopy due cytological diagnosis moderate 
severe dyskaryosis. aliquots removed subject rna extraction at, 6h
(base-line), 4, 7 14 days, post-collection. hpv mrna detected using the
pretect hpv proofer, detects hpv 16, 18, 31, 33 45 e6/e7 transcripts
and human small ribonucleoprotein u1a mrna sample control. hpv dna
genotyping also performed base-line assess range types our
group. addition assessment viral rna, overall integrity cellular 
rna extract analysed rna 6000 pico assay. control human rna was
amplified successfully seven samples time point. five seven
women hpv positive e6/e7 viral transcripts base-line positivity
was maintained five 14 days. although pattern cellular rna
profiles generated samples variable, results indicated this
extract could amenable gene expression profiling degradation did
not increase result storage time. concluded hpv rna in
routinely collected lbc specimens preservcyt detected least 14
days sample collection.
