respiratory syncytial virus single-stranded rna virus paramyxoviridae
family preferentially assembles buds apical surface of
polarized epithelial cells, forming filamentous structures contain both
viral proteins genomic rna. recent studies described viral 
host factors involved ribonucleoprotein assembly trafficking of
viral proteins cell surface. cell surface, viral proteins assemble 
into filaments probably require interactions viral proteins, host
proteins cell membrane. finally, membrane scission event must occur 
release free virion. article review recent literature
describing mechanisms drive respiratory syncytial virus assembly and
budding.
