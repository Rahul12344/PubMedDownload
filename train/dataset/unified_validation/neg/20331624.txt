vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) matrix protein (mp) directly induce
apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway due inhibition host gene
expression. previous studies demonstrated mp gene therapy
efficiently suppressed growth malignant tumor vitro vivo. the
present study designed determine possibility combination of
mp gene therapy low-dose cisplatin would improve therapeutic efficacy
against murine melanoma. immunocompetent c57bl/6 mice bearing b16-f10 melanoma
were established. mice treated every 5 days i.v. administration of
10 microg pvax-mp/30 microg liposome complex per mouse 16 days i.p.
delivery cisplatin 4 mg/kg/mouse days 6 12 initiation of
mp treatment. found mp + cisplatin treatment resulted significant
inhibition tumor growth improved survival time melanoma-bearing
mice. mp successfully inhibited angiogenesis assessed cd31. histological
examination revealed combination therapy led significant increased
induction apoptosis, tumor necrosis, elevated cd8(+) lymphocyte
infiltration. furthermore, induction efficacy ctl response was
dramatically enhanced combination therapy. findings may prove useful
in explorations application combinational approaches to
the treatment malignant melanoma.
