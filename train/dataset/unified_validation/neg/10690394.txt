background: epstein-barr virus (ebv) associated lymphoproliferative
disorders high proliferation indices. however, classical hodgkin's disease
(chd) heterogeneous, respect proliferation index reed-sternberg
cell (rs cell), ebv association. hence, investigated whether chd 
without ebv-association differ respect proliferation index rs 
cells. investigated whether would bearing patients
survival.
patients methods: investigated 110 cases chd for: a) ebv association by
immunohistochemical demonstration ebv-latent membrane protein-1 ebv
encoded nuclear rna 1 mrna situ hybridisation; b) proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (pcna) expression rs cells.
results: ebv association noted 86 110 cases (78%). higher pcna
expression (p = 0.004) younger age (p = 0.001) correlated independently 
ebv association. 10 year relapse free survival (rfs) ebv+ ebv-
patients 60% 44%, respectively (p = 0.03). 10 year overall survival 
(os) ebv+ ebv- patients 85% 64%, respectively (p = 0.03). ebv
association maintained significant impact rfs os within cox
proportional hazard model.
conclusions: study suggests ebv likely confer higher pcna
expression also contribute towards maintaining rs cells chd cell
cycle. hence, rs cells ebv associated chd would responsive to
chemotherapy radiotherapy associated dna damage. thus, ebv-association
provides survival advantage chd patients treated standard chemotherapy
and radiotherapy protocols.
