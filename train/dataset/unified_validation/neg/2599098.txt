we examined ribosomal protein kinase activities partially purified
cytoplasmic extracts hela cells infected vaccinia virus. found an
activity activities, absent mock-infected cells, capable of
phosphorylating proteins s2 s13 vitro. ribosomes phosphorylated in
vitro exhibited multiple phosphorylation s2 found vivo, least 3
phosphoryl residues seen, mono-phosphorylation s13. also as
in vivo, ribosomal protein s2 contained phosphothreonine well as
phosphoserine, whereas s13 contained phosphoserine. strongly suggests
that new protein kinase activities responsible ribosomal
protein phosphorylations occur infection vaccinia virus.
