the synthesis alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-, alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-, and
alpha-d-mannopyranosylphosphonate described. condensation of
tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite with
2,3,4,6-tetrakis-o-(phenylmethyl)-1-o-acetyl-alpha-d-glucopyranose generated
2,3,4,6-tetrakis-o-(phenylmethyl)-alpha-d-glucopyranosylphosphonic acetic
anhydride (13). benzyl blocking groups removed catalytic
hydrogenation, anhydride bond cleaved alkaline hydrolysis to
obtain alpha-d-glucopyranosylphosphonate (15).
alpha-d-galactopyranosylphosphonate (17) alpha-d-mannopyranosylphosphonate
(19) also similarly synthesized. anomeric configuration 15 was
assigned single-crystal x-ray analysis, structural assignments 17
and 19 made basis comparative nmr spectral studies. compound 15
was coupled adenosine 5'-phosphoric di-n-butylphosphinothioic anhydride
in dry pyridine give adenosine 5'-phosphoric alpha-d-glucopyranosylphosphonic 
anhydride (23). similarly, uridine 5'-phosphoric
alpha-d-galactopyranosylphosphonic anhydride (24) guanosine 5'-phosphoric
alpha-d-mannopyranosylphosphonic anhydride (25) synthesized 17 19, 
respectively. ovalbumin acceptor [3h]galactose, provided by
udp-[3h]galactose, uridine 5'-phosphoric alpha-d-galactopyranosylphosphonic 
anhydride (24) shown inhibit glycoprotein beta-d-galactosyltransferase (ec
2.4.1.38), apparent ki equal 165 microm. even though ionic
compounds hardly penetrate cell membrane, preliminary vitro antitumor
screening shows compounds 23 25 slightly active human
b-lymphoblastic leukemia human t-lymphoblastic leukemia. none these
compounds show antiviral activity.
