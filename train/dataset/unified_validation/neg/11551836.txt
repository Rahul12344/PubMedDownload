newly developed hepatitis b virus (hbv)-dna quantitative assays,
transcription-mediated amplification hybridization protection assay (tma-hpa)
and branched-dna assay clinically evaluated. subjects consisted 160
chronic hbv carriers; 48 hepatitis antigen (hbeag)-positive, whereas 109 
were anti-hbe-positive (three negative). subjects hbeag,
except one, showed high hbv-dna replication levels (>/=10(5.8) copies/ml). in
hbeag negative subjects, strong correlation serum hbv-dna
and alanine aminotransferase (alt) levels; alt level usually normal the
samples tested showed hbv-dna level less 10(5)/ml, whereas, majority 
of sera hbv-dna concentration greater 10(7)copies/ml showed
elevation serum alt level. intermediate range hbv-dna level (10(5)-10(7)
copies/ml) associated variable alt activity. conclusion, serum
hbv-dna level associated alt elevation lower patients type b
chronic liver disease negative hbeag compared hbeag-positive
counterparts. usually mild liver disease activity patients
with chronic hbv infection serum hbv-dna levels less 10(5)copies/ml.
