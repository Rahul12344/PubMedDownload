many live-attenuated vaccines measles virus developed using either 
the prototype edmonston strain locally isolated measles strains. the
attenuation methods used develop vaccines differed type(s)
of cell line(s) used, number passages, temperatures incubation. to
assess extent genetic diversity within vaccine strains determine
the extent varied passage histories may affected viruses,
we conducted sequence analyses fusion, hemagglutinin, nucleoprotein, and
matrix genes edmonston-derived non-edmonston-derived strains. despite 
diverse geographic origins vaccine viruses different attenuation
methods used, remarkable sequence similarity among strains
examined. sequences vaccine strains similar the
sequences low-passage seed original edmonston strain. most
divergent sequences two non-edmonston-derived vaccines: cam-70, 
a vaccine developed japanese wild-type virus, s-191, was
developed china.
