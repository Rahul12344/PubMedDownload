the authors derived prevalence incidence figures cervical human
papillomavirus (hpv) infections unselected finnish population women aged
22. paper epidemiologic study utilizing mass-screening program
that conducted finland cervical cancer since early 1960s. the
authors estimated lifetime risk cervical hpv infections based the
figures program derived random sample 2,084 (out
of 28,861) routine papanicolaou (pap) smears examined laboratory. the
mass-screening program performed 1985-1986 focusing total cohort
of 22-year-old women (born 1963) kuopio province. 1985, 2,013 women were
invited 1,289 attended. one year later, 1,768 women 2,013 
reinvited, number women screened second round 1,069. the
routine cervicovaginal pap smears taken, including cell sample the
vagina, exocervix, endocervix. smears screened hpv-induced
cytopathic changes cytopathologist. prevalence hpv infection
among 22-year-old women 3% beginning follow-up and
about 7% one year later. crude annual incidence 7.0%. according the
estimates life-time risk, half sexually active women would
experience least one hpv infection within 10 years. 79% finnish
