objective: test t-helper (th)1/th2 cytokine paradigm hiv infection.
design methods: cytokine profiles two separate studies hiv patients and
controls presented: (i) longitudinal study hiv patients cd4 counts 
> 500 x 10(6)/l tested three timepoints compared controls; (ii) blinded
cross-sectional study controls patients high (> 500 x 10(6)/l) and
low (< 500 x 10(6)/l) cd4 counts. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) 
patients controls tested production two type 1 [interleukin
(il)-2, interferon (ifn)-gamma] two type 2 (il-4, il-10) cytokines by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. spontaneous mitogen-induced cytokine 
production measured.
results: hiv infection noted following effects cytokine
production: (i) led vivo activation type 2 cytokines small
group individuals high cd4 numbers characterized spontaneous
release il-4 il-10. longitudinal data showed high spontaneous il-4 and
il-10 consistent feature patient group (at timepoint some
patients high producers) variable given individual; (ii) hiv 
infection impaired ability pbmc respond stimuli (selected 
ability optimally induce cytokine) terms il-2, il-4 il-10
production patients high low cd4 cell counts; (iii)
conversely, hiv infection led overproduction ifn-gamma patients 
high cd4 counts; patients low cd4 produced normal levels ifn-gamma.
conclusions: observations suggest polarization type 1/type 2
cytokine profile hiv patients. instead, data suggested complex
changes type 1/type 2 cytokine patterns hiv infection originally
proposed th1/th2 dichotomy.
