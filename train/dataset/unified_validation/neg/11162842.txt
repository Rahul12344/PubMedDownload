a new plum pox potyvirus (ppv)-based vector constructed the
expression full-length individual foreign proteins. foreign sequences 
cloned nib replicase capsid protein (cp) cistrons. the
heterologous protein split rest potyviral polyprotein by
cleavage site originally separated nib cp proteins 
additional nia protease recognition site engineered amino-terminal end.
this vector (ppv-nk) used clone different genes, engendering stable
chimeras practical applications. constructed chimera expressing
high levels jellyfish green fluorescent protein, useful 
the study ppv molecular biology. vp60 structural protein rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) also successfully expressed making use of
the ppv-nk vector. inoculation extracts vp60-expressing plants induced 
remarkable immune response rhdv rabbits, natural host. moreover,
these animals protected lethal challenge rhdv.
