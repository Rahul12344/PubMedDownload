one major concern clinical application embryonic stem cell
(esc)-derived cells potentiation latent tumorigenicity residual
undifferentiated cells. despite use intensive methodological approaches to
eliminate residual undifferentiated cells, properties cells remain
elusive. here, show serum-free neural differentiation condition, 
residual undifferentiated cells markedly delay progression cell cycle
without compromising pluripotency. dormant pluripotency maintained
during reculture cells serum-free condition, whereas upon serum
stimulation, cells exited dormant state restarted proliferation and
differentiation three germ layers. microarray analysis revealed set of
genes significantly upregulated dormant escs compared their
levels regulation proliferating escs. among them, identified the
transcription factor forkhead box o3 (foxo3) essential regulator 
maintenance pluripotency dormant escs. study demonstrates the
transition dormant state endows residual undifferentiated cells with
foxo3-dependent leukemia inhibitory factor/serum-independent pluripotency.
