purpose: oncolytic viral therapy newly developed modality treat tumors.
many clinical trials worldwide examined efficacy locally injected
oncolytic viruses. however, systemic intravascular injections limited 
humoral immune response, dramatically decreases level infection. 
overcome limitation, encapsulated oncolytic virus liposomes.
methods: infectious properties herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1)
mutant, hrr3, without liposomes presence neutralizing
antibodies evaluated using replication cytotoxicity assays vitro. 
evaluate efficacy intravascular virus therapy liposomes the
presence neutralizing antibodies, immunized mice bearing multiple liver
metastases intraportally peritoneally administered hrr3 hrr3 complexed
with liposomes.
results: anti-hsv antibodies attenuated infectiousness cytotoxicity of
hrr3, whereas hrr3/liposome complexes attenuated anti-hsv
antibodies. although survival rate non-immunized mice treated hrr3
alone similar mice treated hrr3/liposome complexes, the
survival rates immunized mice treated hrr3 alone significantly
reduced compared mice treated hrr3/liposome complexes.
conclusions: systemic intravascular delivery hrr3/liposome complexes in
the presence pre-existing neutralizing antibodies effective treat
multiple liver metastases.
