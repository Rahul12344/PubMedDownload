background: immune recognition foreign proteins cells hinges the
formation ternary complex sandwiching constituent peptide protein
between major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecule cell receptor
(tcr). viruses evolved means "camouflaging" themselves, avoiding immune
recognition reducing mhc and/or tcr binding constituent peptides.
computer-driven cell epitope mapping tools used evaluate the
degree particular viruses used means avoiding immune
response, analyses focus mhc-facing 'agretopes'. set out
a new means evaluating tcr faces viral peptides addition their
agretopes, integrating evaluations sides ternary complex a
single analysis.
methods: paper develops call janus immunogenicity score (jis),
bringing together well-established method predicting mhc binding, a
novel assessment potential tcr binding based similarity self. 
intuitively, good mhc binding poor self-similarity required high
immunogenicity (i.e., robust effector response).
results: focusing class ii antigen-processing pathway, show the
jis effector epitopes null regulatory epitopes deposited large
database epitopes (immune epitope database) significantly different. we
then show different types viruses display significantly different
patterns scores constituent peptides, viruses causing chronic 
infection (epstein-barr cytomegalovirus) strongly shifted lower scores
relative causing acute infection (ebola marburg). similarly find 
distinct patterns among influenza proteins h1n1 (a strain human 
populations rapidly developed immunity) h5n1 h7n9 (highly pathogenic
avian flu strains, significantly greater case mortality rates).
conclusion: janus immunogenicity score, integrates mhc binding tcr 
cross-reactivity, provides new tool studying immunogenicity pathogens
and may improve selection optimization antigenic elements vaccine 
design.
