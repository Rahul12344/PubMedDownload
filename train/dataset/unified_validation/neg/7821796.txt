the marek's disease virus (mdv) glycoprotein b (gb) precursor, gp100, is
proteolytically cleaved two disulfide-linked subunits, gp60 gp49. the
gb homologs herpesviruses, tetrapeptide, arg-xaa-arg-arg, is
immediately upstream predicted cleavage site. investigated the
specificity proteolytic cleavage gp100 introducing mutations within 
its predicted cleavage site (arg-leu-arg-arg) expressed mutants in
recombinant fowlpox virus (fpv). results show three arg residues 
the predicted cleavage site play important role specific proteolytic
cleavage gp100. furthermore, demonstrated cleavage gp100 not
necessary transport gb cell surface.
