the potential use smallpox biological weapon led production
and stockpiling smallpox vaccine immunization healthcare
workers. another public health goal licensing safer vaccine that
could benefit millions people advised take current one 
they contacts increased susceptibility severe vaccine side
effects. vaccines longer tested ability prevent
smallpox, licensing necessarily include comparative immunogenicity and
protection studies non-human primates. compare highly attenuated
modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) licensed dryvax vaccine monkey
model. two doses mva one dose mva followed dryvax, antibody
binding neutralizing titres t-cell responses equivalent higher
than induced dryvax alone. challenge monkeypox virus,
unimmunized animals developed 500 pustular skin lesions became
gravely ill died, whereas vaccinated animals healthy asymptomatic,
except small number transient skin lesions animals immunized only
with mva.
