the western honeybee, apis mellifera, important managed pollinator
globally recently experienced unsustainably high colony losses.
synergistic interactions among stressors believed primarily
responsible. however, despite clear evidence strong effect honeybee
longevity widely-employed neonicotinoid insecticides ubiquitous
ectoparasitic mite varroa destructor, data exist show synergistic effects
between two stressors. even though neonicotinoids significant impact
by themselves, show first time synergistic time-lag interaction
between mites neonicotinoids resulted significantly reduced survival 
of long-lived winter honeybees. even though mites potent vectors of
viruses, virus-insecticide interaction significant impact. data
suggest previously overlooked mechanism possibly explaining recent
unsustainably high losses managed a. mellifera honeybee colonies many
regions world. future mitigation efforts concentrate developing 
sustainable agro-ecosystem management schemes incorporate reduced use of
neonicotinoids sustainable solutions v. destructor mites.
