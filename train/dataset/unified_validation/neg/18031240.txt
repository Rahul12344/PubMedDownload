sumoylation viral proteins widespread serves modify regulate 
properties proteins. papillomaviruses large group small dna
viruses infect skin, leading benign lesions (warts) some
cases progress malignancy. papillomavirus life cycle intimately
connected differentiation process stratified epithelium, several 
viral early proteins function modulate host cell environment. one the
critical early proteins e2 protein, functions viral
replication transcription. present paper, demonstrate e2
proteins sumoylated overexpression sumoylation results a
dramatic increase intracellular levels e2 protein. shown
previously increased sumoylation keratinocyte
differentiation, suggesting levels e2 protein may tied changes 
in cellular sumoylation state differentiation. addition itself
being regulated sumoylation, e2 appears influence sumoylation state 
one binding partners, cellular transcription factor, c/ebp
(ccaat/enhancer-binding protein). overall, observations indicate complex 
interplay viral protein host sumoylation system.
