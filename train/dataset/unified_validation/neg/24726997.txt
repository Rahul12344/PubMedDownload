swine appear key species generation novel human influenza
pandemics. previous pandemic viruses postulated evolved swine by
reassortment avian, human, swine influenza viruses. human pandemic
influenza viruses emerged 1957 1968 well swine viruses
circulating since 1998 encode pb1 segments derived avian influenza viruses. 
here investigate possible role viral replication virulence the
pb1 gene segments present two swine h1n2 influenza viruses,
a/swine/sweden/1021/2009(h1n2) (sw 1021) a/swine/sweden/9706/2010(h1n2) (sw
9706), sw 1021 virus shown pathogenic mice. using 
reverse genetics, swapped pb1 genes two viruses. similar the
sw 9706 virus, chimeric sw 1021 virus carrying sw 9706 pb1 gene not
virulent mice. contrast, replacement pb1 gene sw 9706 virus
by sw 1021 virus resulted increased pathogenicity. study
demonstrated differences virulence swine influenza virus subtype h1n2 
are attributed least part pb1 segment.
