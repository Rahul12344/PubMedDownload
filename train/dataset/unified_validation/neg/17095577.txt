ror2 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression increases during
differentiation pluripotent stem cells osteoblasts declines as
cells progress osteocytes. test whether ror2 plays role in
osteoblastogenesis, investigated effects ror2 overexpression and
down-regulation osteoblastic lineage commitment differentiation.
expression ror2 pluripotent human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) by
adenoviral infection caused formation mineralized extracellular matrix, 
is ultimate phenotype osteogenic tissue. concomitantly, ror2
over-expression inhibited adipogenic differentiation hmscs monitored by
lipid formation. ror2 shifted hmsc fate toward osteoblastogenesis inducing
osteogenic transcription factor osterix suppressing adipogenic transcription 
factors ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor gamma. infection ror2 virus also strongly promoted matrix
mineralization committed osteoblast-like mc3t3-e1 cells. expression ror2 in
a human preosteocytic cell line stable transfection also promoted further
differentiation, judged inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity,
potentiated osteocalcin secretion, increased cellular apoptosis. contrast,
down-regulation ror2 expression short hairpin rna essentially abrogated
dexamethasone-induced mineralization hmscs. furthermore, down-regulation of
ror2 expression fully differentiated saos-2 osteosarcoma cells inhibited
alkaline phosphatase activity. conclude ror2 initiates commitment mscs
to osteoblastic lineage promotes differentiation early late stages 
osteoblastogenesis. finally, using mouse calvariae ex vivo organ culture model,
we demonstrate effects ror2 result increased bone formation,
suggesting may also activate mature osteoblasts.
