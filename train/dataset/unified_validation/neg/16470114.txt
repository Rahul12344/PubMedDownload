objectives: assess potency, breadth action, mechanism action 
the polyclonal goat anti-hiv antibody, pehrg214.
design: typical human antibody responses hiv-1 infection unable to
neutralize virus efficiently, clear infection, prevent disease
progression. however, potent neutralizing antibodies may capable of
playing pivotal role controlling hiv replication vivo. pehrg214 a
polyclonal caprine antibody raised purified hiv-associated proteins, such
that epitopes immunologically silent humans may potentially be
recognized another species. administered safely hiv-infected
individuals phase clinical trials.
methods: anti-hiv activity pehrg214 assessed using neutralization 
virion lysis assays. target proteins pehrg214 activity investigated 
using flow cytometry adsorption anti-cell antibodies antibody 
cocktail.
results: pehrg214 strongly neutralized diverse range primary hiv-1 isolates,
encompassing subtypes e ccr5 cxcr4 phenotypes. neutralization
was enhanced presence complement. pehrg214 also induced
complement-mediated lysis hiv-1 isolates tested, recognized or
cross-reacted number host cell proteins. lysis abrogated by
adsorption and/or b cells expressing gpi-linked proteins, by
gpi-deficient b cells red blood cells.
conclusions: pehrg214 found potently neutralize lyse hiv-1 particles. 
by targeting host cell proteins present viral envelope, are
conserved among strains tested, pehrg214 potentially opens highly novel 
means eliminating circulating virus infected individuals.
