influenza virus (iav) leading cause respiratory tract disease
worldwide. anti-viral cd8(+) lymphocytes responding iav infection are
believed eliminate virally infected cells direct cytolysis may also
contribute pulmonary inflammation tissue damage via release of
pro-inflammatory mediators following recognition viral antigen displaying
cells. previously demonstrated iav antigen expressing inflammatory
cells hematopoietic origin within infected lung interstitium serve as
antigen presenting cells (apc) infiltrating effector cd8(+) lymphocytes;
however, spectrum inflammatory cell types capable serving apc was
not determined. here, demonstrate viral antigen displaying neutrophils
infiltrating iav infected lungs important cell type capable acting 
as apc effector cd8(+) lymphocytes infected lungs that
neutrophils expressing viral antigen result direct infection iav
exhibit potent apc activity. findings suggest addition to
their suggested role induction innate immune responses iav, virus
clearance, development pulmonary injury, neutrophils serve apcs
to anti-viral effector cd8(+) cells within infected lung interstitium.
