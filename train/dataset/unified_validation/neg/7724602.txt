toroidal dna condensates received considerable attention possible 
relationship packaging dna viruses general model of
ordered dna condensation. spool-like model primarily supported dna
organization within toroids. however, observations suggest actual
organization may considerably different. present alternate model in
which dna given toroid organized within series equally sized
contiguous loops precess toroid axis. related model the
toroid formation process also presented. kinetic model predicts a
distribution toroid sizes dna condensed solution good
agreement experimental data.
