mechanism activation human ras genes cloned gastric adenocarcinoma
and pancreatic carcinoma cell line.

o'hara bm, oskarsson m, tainsky ma, blair dg.

we analyzed mechanism activation two human ras oncogenes. 
also identified rasn gene human gastric adenocarcinoma efficiently
induced morphological transformation tumorigenicity nih3t3 cells a
transfection assay. rasn gene tumor tissue dna appear be
rearranged amplified. molecular clone, contained ecori fragment
spanning first second rasn exons, molecularly cloned directly from
the human tumor dna. chimeric constructions dna sequencing defined the
mechanism activation gene mutation 61st amino acid codon
substituting arginine glutamine. normal dna isolated epstein-barr virus 
immortalized lymphocytes derived patient induce
morphological transformation tumorigenicity nih3t3 cells. cloned cell
line isolated human pancreatic carcinoma cell line panc1 previously 
been shown contain activated rask-2. sequence analysis cloned
transfected gene reveals g change within codon 12, presumably
responsible biological activity. represents first identification
of codon 12 aspartic acid substitution c-rask oncogene human
tumor-derived cell line.
