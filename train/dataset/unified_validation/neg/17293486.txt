it important regulate oxygen concentration scavenge oxygen radicals
throughout life animals. mammalian embryos, proper oxygen concentration
gradually increases utero excessive oxygen rather toxic early
embryonic development. reactive oxygen species (ros) generated by-products
in respiratory system increased inflammatory conditions. the
pathogenesis variety adult human diseases cancer and
cardiovascular disorders, ros cause enhancement tissue injuries. ros
promote development atherosclerosis also tissue injury during
the reperfusion process. thioredoxin (trx) system one most
important mechanisms regulating redox balance. trx small redox
active protein distributed ubiquitously various mammalian tissues cells.
trx acts antioxidant also anti-inflammatory an
antiapoptotic protein. trx induced oxidative stress released cells
in response oxidative stress. various human diseases, serum/plasma
level trx well-recognized biomarker oxidative stress. discuss 
the roles trx oxygen stress redox regulation different
perspectives, embryogenesis adult diseases focusing cardiac
disorders.
