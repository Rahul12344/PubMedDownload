objective: investigate characteristics human caliciviruses (hucv)
diarrhea among infants young children acute diarrhea lanzhou, gansu
province, china using molecular epidemiologic techniques.
methods: stool specimens collected outpatients inpatients with
acute diarrhea lanzhou. enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (elisa) used 
detect rotavirus antigen (rva). reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions 
(rt-pcr) used detect hucv stool specimens rv elisa (-).
results: stool specimens collected 515 cases lanzhou december
2001 june 2004, 264 rva elisa (+) 251 rva elisa (-). among all
cases rva elisa (-), 25 (9.96%) found positive hucv. hucv was
detected 12 133 cases (9.02%) december 2001 november 2002, no
genotyping performed cases. july 2003 june 2004 13 118
cases (11.02%) found positive hucv, 11 cases norwalk-like
virus gii (nlv gii) infection 2 cases sapporo-like virus infection (one
case combined infection astrovirus) nlv gi found. hucv
infection mainly occurred children 2 years age seasonal
cluster found.
