a cohort 81 hiv-infected participants received seasonal trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine (tiv) humoral responses monitored using
hemagglutination inhibition (hai) assay enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa). three weeks vaccination, percentage cohort had
an hai titer >1:40 35% (for h1n1), 43% (for h3n2) 19% (for influenza
b). increase hai titer achieved increase magnitude the
antibody responses, measured increase elisa titer; well 
as quality improvement antibody responses increased avidity to
the virus. individuals, increase avidity alone sufficient to
reach sero-protective titer. notably, number volunteers showed an
increase elisa titer without rise hai titer. total 24 participants
(30%) show significant increase hai elisa tests after
vaccination. apart lower peripheral cd4+ cell count, non responders'
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) also higher il-10 mrna expression
after tiv vaccination ex vivo. cytokine profiling demonstrated that, apart a
weaker mcp-1 expression non-responder group, pbmc groups
responded comparably lipopolysaccharide (lps) stimulation vitro. since only
3 participants developed sero-protective titers 3 subtypes after
vaccination, study highlights need enhance immunogenicity the
subunit vaccine population, potentially harnessing innate
immunity external adjuvant.
