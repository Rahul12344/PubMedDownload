many insects associated heritable symbionts mediate ecological
interactions, including host protection natural enemies. cowpea
aphid, aphis craccivora, polyphagous pest harbors hamiltonella defensa,
which defends parasitic wasps. despite protective benefit, this
symbiont occurs intermediate frequencies field populations. to
identify factors constraining h. defensa invasion ap. craccivora, estimated
symbiont transmission rates, performed fitness assays, measured infection
dynamics population cages evaluate effects infection. similar results
with pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum, found consistent costs to
infection using component fitness assays, identify clear costs to
infection population cages enemies present. maternal transmission
rates h. defensa ap. craccivora high (ca. 99%) perfect.
transmission failures infection costs likely limit spread protective
h. defensa ap. craccivora. also characterized several parameters h.
defensa infection potentially relevant protective phenotype. confirmed 
the presence h. defensa aphid hemolymph, potentially interacts
with endoparasites, performed real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) estimate
symbiont phage abundance aphid development. also examined strain
variation h. defensa bacteriophage multiple loci, despite our
lines collected different regions north america, infected
with nearly identical strains h. defensa apse4 phage. limited strain
diversity observed defensive elements may result relatively static
protection profile defensive symbiosis.
