background: important question dengue pathogenesis identity of
immune cells involved control dengue virus infection site the
mosquito bite. evidence infection immature myeloid dendritic
cells plays crucial role dengue pathogenesis interaction the
viral envelope e glycoprotein cd209/dc-sign key element their
productive infection. dermal macrophages express cd209, yet little known about
their role dengue virus infection.
methods findings: here, showed dermal macrophages bound recombinant
envelope e glycoprotein fused green fluorescent protein. dermal
macrophages stain il-10 situ, generated dermal-type macrophages from
monocytes presence il-10 study infection dengue virus. 
macrophages able internalize virus, progeny virus production 
undetectable infected cells. addition, ifn-alpha produced in
response virus. inability dengue virus grow macrophages
was attributable accumulation internalized virus particles into
poorly-acidified phagosomes.
conclusions: aborting infection viral sequestration early phagosomes would 
present novel means curb infection enveloped virus may constitute a
prime defense system prevent dengue virus spread shortly bite the
infected mosquito.
