since 2001 models spread foot-and-mouth disease, supported data 
from uk epidemic, expounded best examples of
problem-driven epidemic models. claims generally based comparison 
between model results epidemic data fairly coarse spatio-temporal
resolution. here, focus comparison model data the
individual farm level, assessing potential model predict the
infectious status farms short long terms. although the
accuracy model predicts farms reporting infection 5 and
15%, low levels attributable expected level variation between
epidemics, comparable agreement two independent model
simulations. contrast, accuracy predicting culls higher
(20-30%), lower expected comparison model
epidemics. results generally support contention type the
model used 2001 reliable representation epidemic process, but
highlight difficulties predicting complex human response, terms 
control strategies perceived epidemic risk.
