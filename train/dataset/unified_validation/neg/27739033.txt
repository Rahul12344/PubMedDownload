semliki forest virus (sfv), neurotropic virus, used deliver
heterologous genes cells vitro vivo. study, constructed
a reporter sfv4-fl-egfp found deliver egfp neurons located
at injection site without disseminating throughout brain. lacking 
capsid gene sfv4-fl-egfp block life cycle, forming
replication-competent virus-like particles (vlps). vlps hold subviral
genome using packaging sequence (ps) located within nsp2 gene, can
transfer genome cells. addition, found g protein of
vesicular stomatitis virus (vsvg) package sfv subviral genome, is
consistent previous reports. g protein rabies virus (rvg) could
also package sfv subviral genome. pseudo-typed sfv deliver egfp gene
into neurons. taken together, findings may used construct various
sfv-based delivery systems virological studies, gene therapy, neural
circuit labeling.
