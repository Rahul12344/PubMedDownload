hepatitis b virus (hbv) infections significant threat 30,000 us army
soldiers stationed south korea. hepatitis b surface antigen carrier rates in
some korean populations may run high 15%, hbv incidence estimates for
us soldiers korea ranged 0.6 6% per year. response this
threat, 1 october 1986 us army instituted mandatory three-dose (0,
30-60, 60+ days), 0.1 ml per dose, intradermal (i.d.) immunization regimen
for soldiers bound permanent assignments korea. although shown be
immunogenic experimental studies, i.d. route never attempted on
as large scale operational setting. september 1987, an
evaluation programme compliance immune response conducted. those
who received three doses according schedule, antibody response similar 
that reported previous controlled trials used i.d. approach. the
three-dose i.d. series appeared provide protective antibody levels least
67% soldiers, but, consistent previous trials, antibody levels were
approximately one-half obtained following intramuscular vaccination. we
conclude that, cost-reduction strategy, wide-scale use intradermal
hepatitis b vaccine may useful situations characterized short-term
increased hbv infection risk.
