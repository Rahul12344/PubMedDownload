persistent infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) major risk toward
development hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). elucidation pathogenesis of
hcv-associated liver disease hampered absence appropriate animal
models: animal model hcv infection/pathogenesis except 
the chimpanzee. contrast, number transgenic mouse lines carrying cdna
of hcv genome established evaluated study hcv
pathogenesis. studies using transgenic mouse models, hcv
proteins core protein expressed, indicate direct
pathogenicity hcv, including oncogenic activities. hcv transgenic mouse models
also show close relationship hcv hepatic extrahepatic
manifestations hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance sj√∂gren's
syndrome. crucial role hepatic steatosis insulin resistance the
pathogenesis liver disease hcv infection demonstrated, implying
hepatitis c metabolic disease. besides data connecting liver fibrosis
progression disturbance lipid glucose metabolisms hepatitis c
patients, series evidence found showing association these
two conditions hcv infection, chiefly using transgenic mouse carrying hcv
genome. furthermore, persistent activation peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-alpha recently found, yielding
dramatic changes lipid metabolism oxidative stress overproduction in
cooperation mitochondrial dysfunction. results would provide a
clue understanding role lipid metabolism pathogenesis of
hepatitis c including liver injury hepatocarcinogenesis.
