in report, classical swine fever virus (csfv) ns5a inhibit viral rna
replication concentration reached surpassed level ns5b. three
amino acid fragments csfv ns5a, 137-172, 224-268 390-414 individually were
shown essential ns5b binding. former two fragments were
independently necessary regulation viral rna replication correlated
with ns5b 3'utr binding activity. also found amino acids w143, v145, 
p227, t246, p257, k399, t401, e406 l413 csfv ns5a essential ns5b
binding activity. furthermore, amino acids shown necessary for
viral rna replication infection conserved ns5a proteins csfv, bdv, 
bvdv hcv. results indicated ns5a may regulate viral rna
replication binding ns5b 3'utr. ns5a still regulate viral rna
synthesis binding 3'utr binding ns5b available.
