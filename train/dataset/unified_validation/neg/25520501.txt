bovine parvovirus (bpv), causative agent respiratory gastrointestinal 
disease cows, type member bocaparvovirus genus the
parvoviridae family. toward efforts obtain template development of
vaccines small-molecule inhibitors pathogen, structure the
bpv capsid, assembled major capsid viral protein 2 (vp2), determined
using x-ray crystallography well cryo-electron microscopy and
three-dimensional image reconstruction (cryo-reconstruction) 3.2- 8.8-å
resolutions, respectively. vp2 region ordered crystal structure, 
residues 39 536, conserves parvoviral eight-stranded jellyroll motif and
an αa helix. bpv capsid displays common parvovirus features: channel and
depressions surrounding 5-fold axes protrusions surrounding 3-fold
axes. however, rather depression centered 2-fold axes, raised
surface loop divides feature bpv. additional observed density the
capsid interior cryo-reconstructed map, compared crystal structure,
is interpreted 10 additional n-terminal residues, residues 29 38, that
radially extend channel 5-fold axis, observed human
bocavirus 1 (hbov1). surface loops various lengths conformations extend
from core jellyroll motif vp2. loops confer unique surface
topology bpv capsid, making strikingly different hbov1 well

decorating bpv capsid surface serve determinants receptor recognition, 
tissue host tropism, pathogenicity, antigenicity.importance: bovine
parvovirus (bpv), identified 1960s diarrheic calves, type member
of bocaparvovirus genus nonenveloped, single-stranded dna (ssdna)
parvoviridae family. recent isolation human bocaparvoviruses children
with severe respiratory gastrointestinal infections generated interest in
understanding life cycle pathogenesis emerging viruses.

elements location n-terminal residues known bocaparvovirus
capsid structures. however, surface loops high variability sequence and
conformation give bpv unique capsid surface topology. similar analogous regions
in parvovirinae type members important determinants receptor
recognition, tissue host tropism, pathogenicity, antigenicity.
