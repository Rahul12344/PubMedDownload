bovine leukosis (bl) retroviral disease caused bovine leukosis virus 
that affects cattle. associated decreased milk production and
increased cull rates due development lymphosarcoma. virus also affects 
the immune system. infected cows display weak response vaccinations. it
is important determine heritability bl susceptibility greater
than zero, environment factor used reduce
the transmission incidence disease. accordingly, aim study
was estimate heritability bl incidence genetic merit sires 
for leukosis resistance holstein jersey cattle. continuous scores and
binary milk elisa results 13,217 holstein cows 114 dairy herds across 16
states 642 jersey cows 8 dairy herds considered. data obtained
from commercial testing records antel biosystems (lansing, mi). the
13,859 animals tested, 38% found infected disease. linear and
threshold animal models used analyze continuous binary data,
respectively. results models similar terms estimated
breeding values variance components respective scales. estimates 
heritability obtained 2 approaches approximately 8% both
breeds, indicating considerable genetic component underlying bl disease
incidence. correlation estimated breeding values 2
models larger 0.90, lists top 10% bulls selected each
model 80% overlap breeds. summary, results indicate 
simple linear model using continuous elisa scores response variable
was reasonable approach genetic analysis bl incidence cattle. 
addition, levels heritability found indicate genetic selection could 
also used decrease susceptibility bovine leukosis virus infection in
holstein jersey cattle. research necessary investigate the
genetic correlations bl production reproduction traits, 
search potential genomic regions harboring major genes affecting bl
susceptibility.
