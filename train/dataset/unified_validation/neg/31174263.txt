background: nail changes, including onychomadesis (nail shedding) beau's
line, following hand-foot-mouth disease (hfmd) common emergence the
stage late complications hfmd. however, exact mechanism still
unknown. therefore, conducted study elucidate mechanism nail
changes following hfmd.
methods: collected 11 patients suffering onychomadesis following hfmd.
nail samples collected. real time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) sequencing human enteroviruses (hev)
were performed. throat swabs rt-pcr sequencing hev performed for
three cases.
results: rt-pcr demonstrated presence coxackievirus a6 (cva6) nail
samples three patients one echovirus.
conclusion: conclusion, believe major cause onychomadesis
following hfmd certain novel viruses, mostly cva6, virulent may
damage nail matrix. direct injury caused cutaneous lesions hfmd around nail
matrix minor cause. still virulent hev may result in
onychomadesis. addition, novel strain cva6 also causes atypical
clinical presentations, adult involvement delayed-onset palmar and
plantar desquamation. physicians familiar atypical presentations
caused novel viruses avoid misdiagnosis even inform patients the
possibility onychomadesis may take place weeks later reassure
patients.
