the role type ii restriction endonucleases phage development two
different strains streptomyces coelicolor analyzed. two ten phages
tested (phi a4 r4c 1) presented low efficiency plating (e.o.p.) the
studied strains. isolation host-range mutants phi a4 r4c 1, with
improved e.o.p. higher adsorption capability two bacterial strains, 
suggests presence host endonucleases main barrier for
these phages, rather adsorption inability.
