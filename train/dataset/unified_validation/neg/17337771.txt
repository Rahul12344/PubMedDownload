recent studies suggest cell-based cellular immunity plays important
role preventing delaying progression infectious neoplastic
diseases. based findings, recent efforts vaccine research giving 
rise new generation "t cell" vaccines. development cell vaccines
has problematic. current investigations focusing gene-based
immunization strategies, including development non-viral "naked" plasmid
dna recombinant viral vector-based genetic immunization approaches. here, 
briefly review recent progress development recombinant viral vectors
for genetic immunization recent studies elucidating differences in
mechanisms genetic immunization. propose mechanism immune
induction depends part unique features specific viral vectors, 
a comparison representative vectors mechanistically enable more
informed understanding determining parameters immune induction. our
initial studies focused identification antigen-presenting-cell
subsets important priming cd8+ cell immunity, effects antigen
persistence immune responses, unique immunogenicity skin a
target tissue vaccine delivery. review data suggesting unique
properties recombinant lentivectors make appealing candidates genetic 
immunization vehicles eliciting cell immune responses.
