remarkable progress structural biology equipped virologists insight
into structures viral proteins virions increasingly high resolution.
structural information used extensively address fundamental questions
about virtually aspects viruses replicate cells, interact 
host, design antiviral compounds. however, many critical aspects of
virology exist outside snapshots captured traditional methods used to
generate high-resolution structures. like proteins, viral proteins not
static structures. conformational flexibility dynamics proteins play a
significant role protein-protein interactions, structure and
biology virus particles. review discuss implications the
dynamics viral proteins biology, antigenicity, immunogenicity of
flaviviruses.
