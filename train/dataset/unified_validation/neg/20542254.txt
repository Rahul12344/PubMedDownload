mounting evidence indicates merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), circular
double-stranded dna virus, causal factor underlying highly lethal form 
skin cancer known merkel cell carcinoma. explore possibility mcv
and polyomaviruses commonly inhabit healthy human skin, developed an
improved rolling circle amplification (rca) technique isolate circular dna
viral genomes human skin swabs. complete mcv genomes recovered 40%
of healthy adult volunteers tested, providing full-length, apparently wild-type
cloned mcv genomes. rca analysis also identified two previously unknown
polyomavirus species name human polyomavirus-6 (hpyv6) hpyv7.
biochemical experiments show polyomavirus dna shed skin the
form assembled virions. pilot serological study indicates infection 
coinfection three skin-tropic polyomaviruses common. thus, 
least three polyomavirus species constituents human skin microbiome.
