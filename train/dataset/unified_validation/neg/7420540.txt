binding wheat germ ribosomes fragmented viral mrna.

kozak m.

the specificity binding wheat germ ribosomes mrna greatly altered by
cleavage message. fragmentation reovirus mrna allowed wheat germ
ribosomes bind protect variety internal sequences not
accessible ribosomes intact message. experiments using the
polycistronic mrna bacteriophage r17, wheat germ ribosomes bound
preferentially beginning lysis peptide synthetase cistrons, and
at third site may derived c-terminal region protein 
cistron. result similar reported previously mammalian
translational system (j.f. atkins et al., cell 18:246-256, 1979) except that, 
the present study, limited cleavage phage rna necessary activate
these sites. extensive fragmentation r17 rna permitted wheat germ
ribosomes bind protect great many additional sites. thus, presence an
(exposed) 5'-terminus rna molecule appears necessary sufficient
for attachment eucaryotic ribosomes.
