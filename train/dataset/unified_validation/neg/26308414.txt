background: immunoregulatory properties mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) have
been well characterized vitro. however, role mscs organ
transplantation remains unclear. purpose study examine the
role indoleamine 2, 3-dioxgenase (ido)-transfected mscs immunoregulation
both vitro vivo.
methods: wild-type (wt) mscs, empty lentivirus-transfected mscs (lenti-mscs) or
ido-lentivirus-transfected mscs (ido-mscs) cocultured peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (pbmcs) cd4cd25 regulatory (treg) cells examine the
impact ido immunoregulatory properties mscs vitro. wt-mscs,
lenti-mscs ido-mscs (2 × 10/kg) intravenously injected rabbit renal 
transplant recipients immediately surgery examine role ido-mscs
in tolerance induction vivo.
results: lentivirus infection mscs resulted stable expression ido. the
ido-mscs inhibited proliferation cd4cd25 effector cells greater
extent wt-mscs. coculture pbmcs ido-mscs induced higher percentage 
of cd4cd25foxp3 treg cells pbmcs. additionally, antigen-specific
suppressive function cd4cd25 treg cells increased. the
ido-mscs-treated treg cells showed upregulated expression cytotoxic
t-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 increased secretion il-10 tgf-β. low
doses ido-mscs prolonged graft survival induced tolerance inducing
antigen-specific cd4cd25 treg cells, evidenced finding that
ido-mscs-treated kidney transplant recipients accepted donor-specific skin grafts
but rejected third-party grafts.
conclusions: ido increased direct immunoregulatory properties mscs.
the ido-mscs enhanced expression function cd4cd25 foxp3 treg cells and
induced allograft tolerance.
