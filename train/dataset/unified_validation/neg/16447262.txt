the complications chronic hepatitis c virus infection prevented by
antiviral therapy. initial choice interferon alfa and, subsequently,
ribavirin potential treatments chronic hepatitis c empirical.
nevertheless, combination pegylated interferon alfa ribavirin has
become standard treatment chronic hepatitis c. since advent of
interferon-based therapy, enormous progress made understanding the
mechanisms treatment efficacy failure, everyday patient management.
the principal advances are: better understanding hepatitis c virus
steady-state kinetics antiviral mechanisms interferon ribavirin;
easier treatment decisions thanks novel assays assess liver disease
severity virological characteristics infection; better use of
virological tests tailor therapy; better management adverse effects; a
better understanding virological treatment failure; better management of
"special" populations, including patients decompensated cirrhosis and
end-stage liver disease, liver transplant recipients, hemodialysis patients and
renal transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected patients,
intravenous drug users patients opiate replacement therapy, virological
non responders previous therapies. steady-state hcv kinetics offers several
potential targets new drugs. targets ideally hit
simultaneously order achieve viral eradication within reasonable time
frame. future drugs hcv infection belong four main categories,
including new interferons, alternatives ribavirin, specific hcv inhibitors,
and immune modulators. new treatments vaccines might make possible to
eradicate hcv future.
