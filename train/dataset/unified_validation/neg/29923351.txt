cardiac hypertrophy one major risk factors chronic heart failure.
the role endophilina2 (endoa2) clathrin-mediated endocytosis and
clathrin-independent endocytosis well documented. present study, we
tested hypothesis endoa2 protects angiotensin ii (ang
ii)-induced cardiac hypertrophy mediating intracellular angiotensin ii type 1 
receptor (at1-r) trafficking neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (nrcms). cardiac
hypertrophy evaluated using cell surface area quantitative rt-pcr
(qpcr) analyses. first time, found endoa2 attenuated cardiac
hypertrophy fibrosis induced ang ii. moreover, endoa2 inhibited apoptosis 
induced excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress (ers), accounted 
beneficial effects endoa2 cardiac hypertrophy. revealed that
there interaction endoa2 at1-r.the expression levels of
endoa2, inhibits at1-r transport cytoplasm membrane, and
the interaction endoa2 at1-r obviously decreased ang ii
treatment. furthermore, ang ii inhibited co-localization at1-r with
grp-78, reversed endoa2 overexpression. conclusion, results
suggested endoa2 plays role protecting cardiac hypertrophy
induced ang ii, possibly inhibiting at1-r transport cytoplasm to
the membrane suppress signal transduction.
