a severe disease farm-raised shrimp, penaeus chinensis spread throughout
chinese coasts since 1993. recently, baculo-like virus diagnosed as
the causative agent epidemic disease. electron microscopic
observation virus described. thin sections hepatopancreatic and
hypodermic tissue diseased p. chinensis showed many rod-shaped, enveloped,
baculo-like virions hypertrophied nuclei infected cells. virion was
filled highly electron dense core. occlusion bodies found.
negative stained intact virions, purified infected tissues centrifugation
on sucrose discontinuous gradients, demonstrated viral envelops been
broken, cylindrical nucleocapside could observed clearly. the
nucleocapsid average 62 nm x 314 nm composed helix system of
capsomers, giving rise open stacked ring structure repeating
approximately every third ring. number repeating unit 13 15. we
propose virus described could designated non-occluded shrimp 
virus (nosv) penaeus chinensis baculo-like virus (pcblv).
