molecular-biological properties two relative temperate erwiniophages 49 59
have comparatively studied. phages highly specific respect
to sensitive bacteria lyse inconsiderable quantity amylovora-like
strains erwinia horticola. established erwiniophages are
distinguished basic parameters single reproduction cycle cells
of common host e. horticola 450. considerable differences phages have
been also found areas genomes responsible establishment and
maintenance lysogenic state cells bacterium-host. study of
structure polypeptides confirmed identity capsids tails phages 
49 59. shown phage 49 another, compared phage 59, 
basal plate, availability destabilises phage tail leads virion
destruction various physical effects. virion dna phages 49 59 of
the size--47.9 kbp, differ gc-content. using restriction
analysis shown genome phage 49, well genome of
phage 59, permuted, permutation discrete character. fact 
recombination interaction erwiniophages 49 59 established.
it supposed phage 49 recombination (hybrid) derivative phage 59
and unknown phage, prophage, genetic module. given recombination,
probably, took place persistence different phages general
polylysogenic system e. horticola.
