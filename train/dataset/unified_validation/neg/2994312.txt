we investigated ability cho cells allow growth papovaviruses by
analyzing viral dna replication transfection using calcium-phosphate
co-precipitation technique. analyses showed sv40-containing
plasmids introduced cho cells, viral dna replicated level of
approximately 1000 copies per antigen-expressing cell, neither late
proteins virus progeny produced. polyoma (py)-containing plasmids
were transfected cho cells, ten-fold higher level py dna present
per antigen-positive cell, viral capsid proteins progeny virus were
detected, indicating cho cells equally restricted all
papovaviruses. infection intact virions restricted cases. 
results indicate either sv40 py dna introduced cho cells able to
express early viral functions, different interactions cellular 
proteins involved replication machinery viral nucleic acids and
proteins result different levels viral dna synthesis virus progeny
production. propose that, favorable genetic characteristics, 
cho cells should, therefore, provide valuable experimental system for
definition cellular contributions papovavirus replication.
