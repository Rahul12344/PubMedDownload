macrophage influx galectin 3 production suggested major players 
driving acute inflammation chronic fibrosis many diseases. however, 
involvement pathogenesis viral myocarditis subsequent
cardiomyopathy unknown. aim characterise role macrophages
and galectin 3 survival, clinical course, viral burden, acute pathology, and
chronic fibrosis coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3)-induced myocarditis. results
showed c3h/hej mice infected cvb3 depleted macrophages by
liposome-encapsulated clodronate treatment compared infected untreated mice 
presented higher viral titres reduced acute myocarditis chronic fibrosis,
compared untreated infected mice. increased galectin 3 transcriptional and
translational expression levels correlated cvb3 infection macrophages and
in non-depleted mice. disruption galectin 3 gene affect viral
titres reduced acute myocarditis chronic fibrosis compared c57bl/6j 
wild-type mice. similar results observed pharmacological inhibition of
galectin 3 n-acetyl-d-lactosamine c3h/hej mice. results showed a
critical role macrophages galectin 3 controlling acute
viral-induced cardiac injury subsequent fibrosis. moreover, fact that
pharmacological inhibition galectin 3 induced similar results macrophage
depletion regarding degree acute cardiac inflammation chronic fibrosis
opens possibility new pharmacological strategies viral myocarditis.
