radioimmunoassays developed detect antigenic determinants common to
mammary tumor viruses (mtv's) four distinct mus species: m. musculus, m.
cervicolor, m. cookll, m. caroll. radioimmunoassays based the
immunologic cross-reactivity observed murine mammary tumor viruses
(mumtv) m. musculus type b retrovirus isolated m. cervicolor. of
the glycoproteins mumtv (gp52, gp36) shared antigenic determinants with
virions m. cervicolor mammary tumor virus. interspecies radioimmunoassays 
gp52 gp36 developed used detect viruses milk noninbred 
feral mus species mumtv-related translational products mammary tumors in
these species. type c type retroviruses, well m432 retrovirus 
m. cervicolor, react either assay. interspecies immunoassays were
therefore specific detection distinct mumtv-related antigenic
determinants.
