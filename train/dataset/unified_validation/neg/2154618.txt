a recombinant vaccinia virus constructed expressed poliovirus coat
precursor protein p1 fused two-thirds 2a proteinase. the
truncated 2a segment could cleaved away p1 region coinfecting with
poliovirus type 1, 2, 3 human rhinovirus 14 with
encephalomyocarditis virus. cleavage vector-derived p1 yield
mature poliovirus capsid proteins observed. attempts isolate vaccinia 
virus recombinants containing portions poliovirus genome encompassed 
the complete gene proteinase 2a unsuccessful, unless expression of
functional 2a abolished insertion frameshift mutation. conclude
that activity 2a proteinase, probably role translational
inhibition, prevented isolation vaccinia virus recombinants expressed 2a.
