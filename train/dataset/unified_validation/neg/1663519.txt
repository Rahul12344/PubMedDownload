a model developed examine effects disinfectants transmission
of infectious rotavirus dried surface humans. initial experiments
were designed find method preserving rotavirus infectivity drying.
culture-adapted human rotavirus (cjn strain) dried room temperature in
different organic suspensions, including fecal matter, several laboratory media, 
and nonfat dry milk (ndm). recoveries infectious virus compared.
fecal matter provided little protection study relative distilled
water, suspensions quite protective, especially ndm, which
consistently allowed recoveries greater 50%. 10(3) focus-forming
units unpassaged cjn virus dried ndm administered subjects 
licked dried material, 100% (8 8) became infected. effect lysol
brand disinfectant spray (lds) next examined. although ndm provided some
protection inactivation lds, spraying conditions recommended 
the manufacturer consistently caused cjn virus titer decrease greater than
5 log10. consumption cjn virus (10(3) focus-forming units) sprayed lds
caused infection 14 subjects, whereas 13 14 subjects consumed the
unsprayed virus became infected (p less 0.00001). methods developed in
this study could used test effects disinfectants spread
of infectious rotavirus inanimate surfaces humans.
