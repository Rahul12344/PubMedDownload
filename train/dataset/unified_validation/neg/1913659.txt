a new human b-cell lymphoma cell line established pleural effusion 
a patient diffuse large cell lymphoma originated ileocecal
tumor. cell line, designated kal-1, passaged 280 times period
of 22 months. cell line successfully maintained chemically defined 
serum-free medium; doubling time approximately 24 h. immunologically, 
cells demonstrated express igm lambda cell surface react
with monoclonal antibodies b-cell antigen including b1, b4, hla-dr, common
acute lymphoblastic leukemic antigen b2 t-cell markers. 
immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangements jh c lambda.
these data indicate cell line represents b-cell lineage the
immature b-cell stage. cell line negative epstein-barr virus nuclear
antigen detectable epstein-barr virus genome cellular dna.
chromosome analyses revealed cells carried 8;22 chromosome
translocation, reminiscent variant type burkitt's lymphoma. however, was
no histological evidence burkitt's lymphoma. molecular studies showed that
kal-1 deregulated high constitutive expression c-myc. cell line was
demonstrated highly tumorigenic injected athymic nude mice. 
tumor model provide clues molecular mechanism involved the
pathogenesis b-cell malignancy appears useful vivo model for
the study molecular events b-cell differentiation therapeutic
investigations.
