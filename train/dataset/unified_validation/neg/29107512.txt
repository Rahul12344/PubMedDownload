zika virus (zikv) evolved overlooked mosquito-borne flavivirus a
global health threat due astonishing causal link microcephaly other
disorders. zikv shown infect neuronal progenitor cells fetal
mouse brain, comparable first-trimester human fetal brain, and
result microcephaly. however, whether different effects 
contemporary zikv strain ancestral strain neonatal mouse brain,
which comparable second-trimester human fetal brain, unclear. here
we adopted mouse model enables us study postnatal effect zikv
infection. show even 100 pfu zikv replicate infect neurons and
oligodendrocytes parts brain. compared ancestral strain
from cambodia (cam/2010), infection zikv strain venezuela (ven/2016) 
leads much severe microcephaly, accompanied neuronal cell death, 
abolishment oligodendrocyte development, dramatic immune response. 
the serious brain damage caused ven/2016 infection would helpful to
elucidate american strain resulted severe neurovirulence infants
and provide clinical guidance diagnosis treatment infection
by different zikv strains.
