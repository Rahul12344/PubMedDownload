in age extensive global traffic systems, close neighborhood man and
livestock regions world, well inadequate prevention measures
and medical care poorer countries, greatly facilitates emergence and
dissemination new virus strains. appearance avian influenza viruses
that infect humans, spread severe acute respiratory syndrome
(sars) virus, unprecedented raging human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
illustrate threat global virus pandemic. addition, viruses like
hepatitis b c claim one million lives every year want of
efficient therapy. thus, new approaches prevent virus propagation urgently
needed. antisense strategies considered attractive means inhibiting
viral replication, oligonucleotides designed interact viral
rna, provided sequence known. ensuing targeted destruction viral
rna interfere viral replication without entailing negative effects on
ongoing cellular processes. review, give examples the
employment antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, rna interference
strategies antiviral purposes. currently, spite encouraging results 
preclinical studies, antisense oligonucleotides ribozymes have
turned efficient antiviral compounds clinical trials. advent 
rna interference seems refueling hopes decisive progress the
field therapeutic employment antisense strategies.
