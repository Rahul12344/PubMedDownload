sporadic inclusion body myositis (ibm) common inflammatory myopathy
affecting patients age 50 years. dysimmune degenerative
aetiologies postulated, viral infections associated
with disease. two hiv-i (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) infected men
and one woman infected htlv-1 (human cell leukaemia virus type 1)
developed progressive proximal muscle weakness unrelated antiretroviral
therapy. muscle biopsies studied light electron microscopy, 
immunocytochemistry determine expression major histocompatibility
complex (mhc) molecules identify type infiltrating cells cell
receptor (tcr) subunits, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) single double immunocytochemistry search retrovirally
infected endomysial cells. clinical features consistent sporadic
ibm. muscle biopsies showed primary endomysial inflammation, red-rimmed
vacuoles, amyloid deposits, eosinophilic inclusions, small round fibres in
groups, diagnostic ibm. muscle fibres expressed mhc class-1 antigens
and invaded primarily cd8+ t-lymphocytes preferentially bearing tcr v
beta 5.1 v beta 13 chains. hiv-1 htlv-1 antigens detected on
endomysial macrophages around muscle fibres, within muscle
fibres. conclude ibm occurs hiv-1 htlv-1 infected individuals 
has clinical, histological immunological pattern identical sporadic ibm 
in non-retrovirally infected patients. retroviruses directly infect
the muscle, persistent retroviral infections may provide superantigenic
stimulation trigger endomysial inflammatory response identical that
occurring sporadic ibm.
