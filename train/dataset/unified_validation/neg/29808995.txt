by taking advantage spectral properties metal carbonyls, have
designed surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers) ratiometric assay for
measuring cell-free circulating dna (cfdna) epstein-barr virus blood 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc). assay consists rhenium carbonyl (re-co)
to serve dna probe, osmium carbonyl (os-co) embedded within the
sers-active substrate internal reference, streptavidin layer the
surface substrate. hybridization cfdna biotinylated-capture
sequence leads immobilization cfdna substrate. binding re-co 
via daunorubicin (dnr) cfdna accompanied appearance strong
symmetry stretching vibrations peak 2113 cm-1, spectral overlap with
os-co (2025 cm-1). results increase i2113/ i2025 ratio and
quantitatively correlates cfdna. sers assay readily used to
detect cfdna blood samples patients due intensity ratio i2113/ 
i2025 lying silent region (1780-2200 cm-1) sers spectrum the
biomolecules.
