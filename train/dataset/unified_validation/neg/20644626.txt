background: current guidelines recommend children treated hepatitis c
virus (hcv) using principles applied adults. however few
published studies assess efficacy safety hcv therapy in
children.
methodology/principal findings: systematic review literature was
completed studies design evaluated hcv therapy children. the
primary outcome sustained virologic response (svr), sub-group analysis
of response rates genotype. 4 randomized controlled trials (rcts)
and 31 non-randomized studies, involving interferon, pegylated interferon
(peg-ifn), combinations drugs ribavirin. svr rate could 
be directly compared populations interventions differed across
studies. genotype reported differed substantially study study.
the overall svr rate peg-ifn ribavirin ranged 30 100% is
comparable rate adults. similar adults, svr rates were
significantly higher children genotype 2 3 compared genotype 1.
adverse effects primarily flu-like symptoms neutropenia. were
insufficient data assess applicability week 12 stop rule (stopping 
therapy week 12 less 2 log drop hcv rna) efficacy
of shortening therapy 24 weeks children genotype 2 3.
conclusions/significance: current guidelines treatment hcv children
are based limited data. research needed define optimal
therapy hcv children.
