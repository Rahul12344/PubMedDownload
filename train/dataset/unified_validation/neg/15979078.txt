cardiovascular diseases often accompanied elevated ldl particles and
endothelial dysfunction. examined possibility concurrently
reducing ldl levels modulating endothelial function using single
helper-dependent adenovirus vector system simultaneously express the
apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme (apobec1) scavenger receptor, class 
b, type (sr-bi) genes control separate promoters (designated
hd-c2). apobec1 edits apob mrna nucleotide c-6666 produce truncated apob48 
and normally expressed small intestine only. sr-bi receptor for
multiple ligands distinct tissue-specific functions. expression apobec1
in hepg2 cells resulted apob mrna editing, leading decreased apob100
abundance (to 6% control) appearance apob48. editing apob mrna
in hepg2 cells resulted decline apob mrna levels 50%. probably 
the result nonsense-mediated decay edited message, since over-expression of
apobec1 increased neither apobec1 complementary factor (acf) mrna protein
abundance. over-expression sr-bi human endothelial cells activated
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) activity phosphorylation enos at
residue ser-1177 presence hdl, leading increased production the
anti-atherogenic molecule nitric oxide (no). taken together, study
demonstrates using one vector delivery system express two genes two
different cell types results cell-specific beneficial effects of
decreasing apob100 production increasing enos activities. combined gene 
expression approach may provide improved therapeutic strategy targeting
multiple sites mechanism cardiovascular injury.
