objective: determine predictive factors progression recurrence 
vulvovaginal condyloma (vvc), specific focus high-risk hpv (hr-hpv)
infections.
methods: retrospective data collected 48 patients diagnosed
with vvc treated topical trichloroacetic acid application laser
therapy 2003-2014 hospital south korea. diagnoses made
based presence exophytic condylomatous lesions assessed direct
visual inspection regardless whether biopsy performed.
results: overall, 18 patients (50.0% test result) positive
for hr-hpv. three-quarters patients poor treatment response had
abnormal cytologies, abnormal cytology risk factor poor response 
(odds ratio, 4.33 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-17.84]). median
follow-up 24months, vvc recurred seven (14.6%) patients. high viral load 
(more 50 relative light units) hr-hpv significantly associated with
recurrence (odds ratio, 7.42, 95% confidence interval, 1.19-46.18).
conclusion: high hr-hpv load risk factor recurrence, not
related treatment response. poor treatment response related to
abnormal cytology viral load.
