the steady-state pharmacokinetics didanosine (ddi) ketoconazole (ket) were
evaluated agents administered alone concurrently patients
seropositive human immunodeficiency virus. using randomized, three-way 
crossover design, multiple oral doses ddi (375 mg twice daily 4 days), ket
(200 mg daily 4 days) combination administered fasting
conditions. ddi ket coadministered, ket given 2 hours before
the morning dose didanosine. serial blood samples total urine output 
a collected administration final single dose day 5 each
treatment session. samples analyzed using high-pressure liquid
chromatography (hplc)/ultraviolet (uv) fluorescence methods specific for
unchanged ddi (plasma urine) ket (plasma only). pharmacokinetic parameters
were calculated using noncompartmental methods. average ddi maximum peak
plasma concentration (cmax) value steady state significantly less ddi
was administered ket (1836 ng/ml) ddi administered alone (2094
ng/ml), although magnitude decrease 12%. didanosine area
under curve (auc(0-tau)) combination (2872 hr.ng/ml) 8% less than
when ddi given alone (3107 hr.ng/ml); difference significant.
there significant differences among evaluated parameters (time 
to reach peak concentration [tmax], half-life [t1/2], renal clearance [clr], or
urinary recovery [ur]) two ddi treatments. significant 
differences among pharmacokinetic parameters two ket
treatments.(abstract truncated 250 words)
