successful retroviral gene transfer hematopoietic cells been
demonstrated number small large animal models clinical trials.
however, severe adverse events related insertional muta-genesis recent
clinical trial x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency reinforced need 
to develop novel retroviral vectors improved biosafety. improvements include
the use self-inactivating (sin) vectors well improvements vector
design. chapter describes basic design gamma-retroviral and
lentiviral sin vectors utilize split-packaging system includes a
description various cloning modules frequently used design 
vectors impact biosafety, titer, transgene expression. addition, this
chapter describes methods used high titer vector production using calcium
phosphate transfection research scale large scale clinical
application using closed system bioreactor.
