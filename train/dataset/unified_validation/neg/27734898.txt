hepatitis b virus (hbv) major human pathogen. study, found that
mir-204 mir-1236 down-regulated hbv-producing cells, could
suppress hbv replication. using bioinformatic approach reporter assay, we
identified mir-1236, reduce hbv replication protein production by
directly targeting hbv specific mrna. contrast, mir-204 identified a
microarray approach, effect hbv rna protein production.
surprisingly, mir-204 could inhibit hbv pregenomic rna encapsidation capsid
assembly. demonstrated hbv suppressed mir-204 expression via
activating host transcription factor stat3. established positive
feed-forward loop hbv, mir-204 stat3. interestingly, mir-204 been
considered tumor suppressor literature. since risk for
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) significantly increased chronic hbv
patients, possible chronic suppression mir-204 hbv contributes
to hcc incidence. mir-204 mir-1236 might useful developing new
therapeutics hbv.
