in study, describe oscillatory flow-assisted efficient target
enrichment method using particle-based microarray device. periodic
oscillating flow effectively increased mixing binding performance between
the target molecules sample solution surface functionalized
microparticles. particles trapped, secured, released elastic
microvalve structure operated via differences flow conditions. single
particle (20-µm diameter) trapping efficiency exceeded 95%. secured particles can
freely move inside array element based oscillating sample flow.
furthermore, particles released array collected the
outlet device, provides opportunity off-chip
analysis. proof-of-concept, used interaction between
streptavidin-coated microparticles fluorescence labeled biotin solution and
demonstrated target enrichment detection based oscillatory flow 
significantly efficient based unidirectional static flow.
the applicability method examined conducting on-chip
immunoassay detect presence anti-zika nonstructural protein 1 (ns1)
monoclonal antibody. limit detection (lod) low 1 ng/ml an
assay time 10 min less 10 µl sample consumption.
