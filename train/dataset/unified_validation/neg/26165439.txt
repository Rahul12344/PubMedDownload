background: crucial understand epidemiology natural history of
human papillomavirus (hpv) infection men women, prevent the
increasing hpv-related disease burden men. data hpv prevalence among men in
the general population limited. cross-sectional population-based
study, aimed estimate genital hpv infection prevalence danish men using 
2 different test methods.
methods: penile swab samples 2460 male employees conscripts military 
barracks denmark tested hpv dna hybrid capture 2 (hc2)
method, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay, inno-lipa. overall and
age- type-specific prevalence hpv infection 95% confidence intervals 
(cis) estimated, correlation 2 assays assessed.
results: overall hpv prevalence 22.2% (95% ci, 20.6-23.9) hc2 test
and 41.8% (95% ci, 39.9-43.8) pcr. pcr-positive samples, 50.9% were
negative hc2 test. 183 pcr-positive samples could genotyped
(hpvx), 88.0% (95% ci, 83.2-92.7) hc2 negative. prevalent types
were hpv-51, hpv-16, hpv-66, hpv-53, hpv-6. prevalence high-risk and
low-risk hpv peaked among men aged 20 29 years, whereas hpvx prevalence
increased age.
conclusions: human papillomavirus highly prevalent general male
population denmark, hpv-16 hpv-51 prevalent.
polymerase chain reaction detects twice many positive samples hc2 but
includes hpvx, possibly representing cutaneous hpv types found normal genital 
skin.
