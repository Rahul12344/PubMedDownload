we studied evolution hiv-1 infection immune response six years 
in two twins born infected mother. children continuous
progression infection, proved cd4+ cell count, serum anti-hiv
antibodies, cultivable virus proviral load. now, children on
antiviral treatment. analysis serum antibodies showed different immune
response children. one developed higher levels antibodies
directed viral proteins synthetic peptides derived their
aminoacid sequence. child, amount cultivable virus increased less 
than twin. nucleotide sequencing part viral genoma, showed that
the virus belonged b subtype, prevalent america europe. the
observed differences viral sequences suggest different selective pressure in
both twins. phenomenon could related observed differences in
immune response.
