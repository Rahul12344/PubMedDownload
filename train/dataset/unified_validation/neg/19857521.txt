fatal disease chronic manageable one. first haart regimens worked in
suppressing virus, encumbered variety short term long term
side effects. recent regimens became simpler, easier take, fewer
adverse events. look people living perhaps normal life span hiv, 
the increasing number antiretroviral agents available means that
individualizing treatment become feasible longer downstream
adverse events related haart, effect cardiovascular disease and
diabetes, renal hepatic disease, begun dominate choice drugs. 
a knowledge short long term adverse events associated haart 
is essential providers patients. new drugs acceptable in
the current field, pass litmus test tolerability. since
adverse events often remarkably idiosyncratic, pharmacogenomics may offer a
way predicting side effects severity particular drug drug 
class individual patients. article forms part special issue of
antiviral research marking 25th anniversary antiretroviral drug discovery 
and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.
