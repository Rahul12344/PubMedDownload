we examined series squamous cell carcinomas (scc) anus, anal
intraepithelial neoplasia grade iii (ainii) lesions haemorrhoids the
presence sequences transforming human papillomavirus (hpv) types by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr)/southern blotting. addition, dnas
have analysed abnormalities c-myc, p53 retinoblastoma (rb-1) 
gene loci southern blotting. hpv16 sequences detected total 38 of
50 (76%) hpv18 sequences 4 50 cancers (8%). 12 haemorrhoids
examined, none contained hpv16 hpv18 sequences. amplification c-myc was
demonstrated 15 50 cancers (30%), 13 hpv16 positive, 
one also positive hpv18. amplification c-myc observed 5
ainiii 41 haemorrhoid dnas analysed. rearrangement c-myc not
seen dnas. gross rearrangement, loss p53 rb-1 loci not
observed normal tumor tissue. however, preliminary analysis p53
sequence, three tumours negative hpv heterozygous p53 point mutation
whereas six hpv positive tumours two haemorrhoids wild-type sequence
throughout exons four ten.
