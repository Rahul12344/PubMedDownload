an integrated assessment system specific hepatitis b virus (hbv) dane
particle dna developed examine activity potential anti-hbv
compounds chronic hbv-producing hepg2-derived 2.2.15 cells. cell culture,
immunoaffinity purification, polymerase chain reaction, hybrid-capture
detection performed microtiter format facilitate increased
throughput automation. high sensitivity afforded assay provided
quantitative detection less 0.5 fg extracellular hbv dna 25
microliters cell culture supernatants, drug-induced reductions hbv
titers greater 100-fold easily measured. fluorometric determination 
total cellular dna 96-well proliferating cell cultures allowed
simultaneous evaluation inhibition cell growth, thus providing ability 
to assess overall selectivities candidate compounds single
experiment. potent activities three anti-hbv compounds, (+) (-)
enantiomers cis-5-fluoro-1-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxythiolane-5-yl]cytosine
(ftc) d-carbocyclic-2'-deoxyguanosine (cdg), confirmed method.
(-)-ftc active (+) enantiomer (50% inhibitory concentrations,
0.033 +/- 0.006 0.723 +/- 0.160 microm [standard error mean; sem],
respectively), enantiomers demonstrated lack cytotoxicity 200 
microm. cdg potent (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.0063 +/- 0.0007
microm [sem]) also significantly toxic, inhibiting cell growth by
50% 32 +/- 6 microm (sem). results demonstrate usefulness this
immunoaffinity-based, quantitative polymerase chain reaction system a
high-capacity vitro tool assessment anti-hbv compound selectivity.
