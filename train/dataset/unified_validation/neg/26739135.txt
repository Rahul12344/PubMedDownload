hepatitis b virus (hbv) reactivation immunosuppressive therapy common
in patients solid tumor hematological malignancies. associated with
significant morbidity mortality due hepatitis flare and/or hepatic
decompensation. consequences arising hbv reactivation are, however,
largely preventable. routine screening hbv serologic status recommended
for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy biologics. recognizing
different serological patterns (which represent either overt occult hbv
infection) types immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a
risk-adapted approach established. prophylactic therapy nucleos(t)ide
analogues (prior concomitantly commencement immunosuppressive
therapies) effective pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when
hbv dna level rising) high-risk individuals. entecavir proven to
be effective lamivudine according recent studies. close monitoring
of serum hbv level preferred strategy low-risk patients. however, the
optimal interval dna monitoring duration therapy remain unknown.
