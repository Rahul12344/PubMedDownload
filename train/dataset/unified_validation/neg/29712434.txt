we present general method called atom-wise free energy perturbation (afep),
which extends conventional molecular dynamics free energy perturbation (fep)
simulation give contribution free energy change atom. afep 
is derived expansion zwanzig equation used exponential
averaging method defining system total energy partitioned into
contributions atom. partitioning method assumed used group 
terms expansion correspond individual atoms. afep applied six 
example free energy changes demonstrate method. firstly, hydration
free energies methane, methanol, methylamine, methanethiol, caffeine in
water. afep highlights atoms molecules interact favorably or
unfavorably water. finally afep applied binding free energy of
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease lopinavir, afep reveals the
contribution atom binding free energy, indicating candidate areas 
of molecule improve produce strongly binding inhibitor. fep
gives single value free energy change already useful
method. afep gives free energy change "part" system being
simulated, part mean individual atoms, chemical groups, amino acids, or
larger partitions depending user trying measure. method
should various applications molecular dynamics studies physical,
chemical, biochemical phenomena, specifically field computational
drug discovery.
