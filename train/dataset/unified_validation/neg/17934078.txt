before emergence severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus
(sars-cov) 2003, 12 animal human coronaviruses known. the
discovery virus soon followed discovery civet bat
sars-cov human coronaviruses nl63 hku1. surveillance coronaviruses
in many animal species increased number list coronaviruses to
at least 36. explosive nature first sars epidemic, high mortality,
its transient reemergence year later, economic disruptions led rush on
research epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological,
virological, basic scientific aspects virus disease.
this research resulted 4,000 publications, most
representative works could reviewed article. marked
increase understanding virus disease within short
time allowed development diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, 
vaccines, epidemiological infection control measures, could prove
to useful randomized control trials sars return. findings
that horseshoe bats natural reservoir sars-cov-like virus that
civets amplification host highlight importance wildlife and
biosecurity farms wet markets, serve source and
amplification centers emerging infections.
