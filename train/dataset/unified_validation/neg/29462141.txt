the ty1 retrotransposons present genome saccharomyces cerevisiae belong
to large class mobile genetic elements replicate via rna
intermediary constitute significant portion eukaryotic genomes. the
retromobility ty1 regulated numerous host factors, including several
subunits mediator transcriptional co-activator complex. spite its
known function nucleus, previous studies implicated mediator the
regulation post-translational steps ty1 retromobility. resolve this
paradox, systematically examined effects deleting non-essential
mediator subunits frequency ty1 retromobility levels of
retromobility intermediates. findings reveal loss distinct mediator
subunits alters ty1 retromobility positively negatively >10,000-fold
range regulating ratio internal transcript, ty1i, genomic ty1
transcript. ty1i rna encodes dominant negative inhibitor ty1 retromobility
that blocks virus-like particle maturation cdna synthesis. results
resolve conundrum mediator exerting sweeping control ty1 retromobility 
with minor effects levels ty1 genomic rna capsid protein, 
gag. since majority characterized intrinsic extrinsic regulators of
ty1 retromobility appear effect genomic ty1 rna levels, mediator could 
play central role integrating signals influence ty1i expression to
modulate retromobility.
