the relative frequencies igm antiigg autoantibody (rheumatoid factor)
producing cells induced polyclonal b cell activator epstein-barr virus
were measured peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures normal children and
patients juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. frequencies rheumatoid factor
precursor b cells normal children lower adults, higher than
neonates. frequency increased age donor. seronegative
children systemic-onset pauciarticular-onset types juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis, number igm antiigg inducible b cells not
significantly different (p greater 0.05) age-matched controls. patients
with seropositive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis seropositive adult rheumatoid 
arthritis significantly higher igm antiigg precursor cell frequencies than
age-matched normal subjects (p less 0.01 p less 0.02,
respectively). contrast, patients seronegative polyarticular-onset
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis average precursor frequency significantly
lower normal age-matched controls (p less 0.05), analogous results
previously noted adult seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. thus, children 
and adults seronegative polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis deficiency 
in b cells produce igm antiigg induced epstein-barr virus.
this distinguished seropositive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and
rheumatoid arthritis patients, normal subjects, patients the
pauciarticular-onset systemic-onset types seronegative juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis.
