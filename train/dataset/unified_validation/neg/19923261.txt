sweet potato mild mottle virus (spmmv) type member genus ipomovirus
(family potyviridae). spmmv occurs cultivated sweetpotatoes (ipomoea batatas
lam.; convolvulaceae) east africa, natural wild hosts unknown. 
this study, spmmv detected 283 (9.8 %) 2864 wild plants (family
convolvulaceae) sampled different agro-ecological zones uganda. the
infected plants belonged 21 species previously known be
natural hosts spmmv. size spmmv coat protein (cp) determined by
western blot analysis, n-terminal protein sequencing peptide mass
fingerprinting. data implicated proteolytic cleavage site, vyveph/a, the
nib/cp junction, resulting cp approximately 35 kda. nearly complete
sequences 13 spmmv isolates characterized. phylogenetic analysis of
non-recombinant cp-encoding sequences placed five isolates wild species
sampled central zone uganda separate cluster. recombination
events detected 5'- 3'-proximal parts genome, providing
novel evidence recombination genus ipomovirus. thirteen amino acids 
the n terminus p1 protein positive selection, whereas purifying
selection implicated hc-pro-, p3-, 6k1- cp-encoding regions.
these data, supported previous studies ipomoviruses, provide indications of
an evolutionary process p1 proteinase responds needs of
adaptation.
