observation molecular processes inside living cells fundamental deeper
understanding virus-host interactions filoviral-infected cells. these
observations provide spatiotemporal insights protein synthesis,
protein-protein interaction dynamics, transport processes highly
pathogenic viruses. thus, live-cell imaging provides possibility for
antiviral screening real time gives mechanistic insights into
understanding filovirus assembly steps dependent cellular factors,
which represent potential targets highly fatal disease. we
describe analysis living filovirus-infected cells maximum biosafety
(i.e., bsl4) conditions using plasmid-driven expression fluorescently labeled 
viral cellular proteins and/or viral genome-encoded expression of
fluorescently labeled proteins. multiple-color multidimensional
time-lapse live-cell imaging analyses powerful method gain better
understanding filovirus infection cycle.
