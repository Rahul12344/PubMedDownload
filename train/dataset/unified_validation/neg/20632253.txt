angiogenesis plays pivotal role many serious life-threatening disorders 
(e.g., cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, arthritis, psoriasis, nephropathy, 
retinopathy) regulated delicate equilibrium variety pro-
and anti-angiogenic factors. although recombinant platelet factor 4 (pf4) was
originally developed evaluated clinical alternative protamine for
heparin neutralization, current scientific evidence supports role 
protein derivative peptides inhibiting tumor growth spread, by
suppression tumor-induced neovascularization many different types solid 
tumors. heparin-binding tetramer, recombinant pf4 interferes several
steps endothelial cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, regulates
apoptotic death activation distinct signal transduction pathways,
inhibits growth factor receptor binding, amplifies inflammatory response of
natural killer cells regulation cytokines production, induces 
maintains nonspecific immune response cancer cells. biological
evidences paved way development marketing novel pf4-based
angiostatic agents characterized reduced toxicity improved
bioavailability, thus raising possibility alternative approach for
preventing treating growth metastasis tumors. pf4-derived
molecules carboxyl-terminal fragments recombinant human pf4 and
modified chimeric peptides already developed exhibit stronger 
anti-angiogenic properties parent molecule may serve leads for
further therapeutic developments. newer means delivering this
anti-angiogenic agent also attempted, including pf4-bearing polymeric
microspheres, vector-mediated pf4 transduction, transgene transfection into
oncolytic viruses, molecular targeting therapy pf4 rhupf4
conjugates. delivery systems aim produce high concentrations the
therapeutic agent local area sustained period, thereby avoiding the
typical problems encountered long-term administration recombinant
proteins.
