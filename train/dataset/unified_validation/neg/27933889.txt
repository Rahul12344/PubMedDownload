the pharmacokinetic properties tenofovir (tfv) charged nucleoside
analogues dramatically improved upon conjugation lipid prodrug. we
previously prepared reduction-sensitive lipid conjugates tfv demonstrate 
superior antiviral activity compared lipid conjugates including the
clinically approved formulation, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf). in
continuation work, synthesized next-generation conjugates with
reduced cytotoxicity retain potent antiviral activity hiv-1 hbv 
with therapeutic index >100000 potent conjugate. also show that
disulfide reduction responsible prodrug cleavage unless 3-exo-tet
intramolecular cyclization occur, suggesting enzymatic hydrolysis is
predominantly responsible activity prodrugs vitro.
