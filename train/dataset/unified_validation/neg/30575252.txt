citrus sudden death-associated virus (csdav) member genus marafivirus
in family tymoviridae, associated citrus sudden death (csd)
disease brazil. difficulties purification csdav infected citrus
plants prevented progress investigation role virus 
csd understanding molecular biology. work, have
constructed full-length cdna clone csdav driven 35s promoter
(35srbz-csdav). agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated inoculation 35srbz-csdav in
nicotiana benthamiana plants enabled fast recovery large amounts virions 
from agroinfiltrated leaves, allowed better molecular
characterization csdav. in vivo analyses mutant versions 35srbz-csdav
revealed expression strategies used csdav production capsid
proteins (cps). showed csdav virions contain three forms cp, of
which generated coding sequence, different mechanisms.
the major cpp21 product direct translation leaky scanning the
second start codon subgenomic rna (sgrna), whereas minor cps, p25 
p23, produced direct translation first start codon sgrna
and trans-proteolytic cleavage processing derived p25 precursor,
respectively. together, findings contribute advance understanding of
csdav genome expression strategies. addition, construction and
characterization csdav infectious clone represent important steps towards 
the investigation role virus csd use tool for
citrus biotechnology.
