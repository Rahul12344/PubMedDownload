background: enterovirus 71 (ev71) remains leading pathogen acute infectious
diseases children, especially asia. cellular basis establishing a
virus-specific antibody response acute ev71 infections unclear children.
methods: studied magnitude virus-specific antibody-secreting b cells
(ascs) relationship serological response, clinical parameters, and
virological parameters among children laboratory-confirmed ev71 infection.
results: potent ev71 genogroup b- virus-specific asc response detected 
in first week illness among genotype b5 ev71-infected children. the
cross-reactive ev71-specific asc response genogroup c viral antigens composed 
about 10% response. ev71-specific asc response children aged ≥3
years produced immunoglobulin g predominantly, immunoglobulin was
predominant younger children. proliferation marker expressed the
majority circulating ascs acute phase ev71 infection. virus-specific
asc responses significantly correlated throat viral load, fever duration,
and serological genogroup-specific neutralization titer.
conclusions: presence virus-specific asc response serves early
cellular marker ev71-specific antibody response. detailed study 
ev71-specific ascs monoclonal level crucial delineate the
specificity function antibody immunity children.
