six months inoculation caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus, serum
and synovial fluid virus-infected goats antibodies to
[35s]methionine-labeled viral proteins apparent molecular weights of
125,000, 90,000, 28,000, 15,000. 125,000-, 90,000-, and
15,000-molecular-weight methionine-labeled proteins identified virion
surface glycoproteins lactoperoxidase iodination galactose
oxidase-boro[3h]hydride reduction labeling techniques. radioimmunoassay antibody 
titers purified p28, abundant viral structural protein, averaged
1:182 synovial fluid 1:67 serum 6 months inoculation. high
dilutions serum synovial fluid reacted gp90 gp125 electroblotted 
onto nitrocellulose paper polyacrylamide gels. anti-gp90 activity was
detected dilutions immunoglobulin g content 0.02 11 micrograms, 
whereas antibody p28, detectable western blots, present samples
with immunoglobulin g content 0.1 2 mg, representing 100- to
1,000-fold-greater titers antibody surface glycoprotein. synovial
fluids often contained anti-gp90 antibody sera. immunoprecipitation
of lactoperoxidase-iodinated virus confirmed presence high antibody titers
to two virion surface glycoproteins. antiviral gp90 gp125
antibody abundant synovial fluid infected goats, probably
contributes high immunoglobulin g1 concentrations seen site 6
months caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus infection.
