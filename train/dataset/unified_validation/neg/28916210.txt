objective: previous hpv models included genital transmission, when
evidence suggests transmission several anatomical sites occurs. we
compared model predictions population-level hpv vaccination effectiveness
against genital hpv16 infection women, using 1) uni-site (genital site), and
a 2) multi-site model (genital one extragenital site).
methods: developed uni-site multi-site deterministic hpv transmission 
model, assuming natural immunity either site-specific systemic. both
models calibrated genital hpv16 prevalence (5%-7.5%), whilst the
multi-site model calibrated hpv16 prevalence representative oral
(0%-1%) anal (1%-7.5%) sites. model, identified 2500 parameter
sets fit endemic genital extragenital prevalences within pre-specified
target ranges. base-case analysis, vaccination girls-only 40%
coverage. vaccine efficacy 100% sites lifetime protection. the
outcome relative reduction genital hpv16 prevalence among women at
post-vaccination equilibrium (rrprev). rrprev stratified extragenital
prevalence pre-vaccination.
results: assumptions site-specific immunity, rrprev multi-site 
model generally greater uni-site model. differences the
uni-site multi-site models greater transmission the
extragenital site genital site high. assumptions systemic
immunity, multi-site uni-site models yielded similar rrprev the
scenario without immunity extragenital infection. scenario with
systemic immunity extragenital infection, multi-site model yielded
lower predictions rrprev uni-site model.
conclusions: modelling genital-site transmission may overestimate
vaccination impact extragenital infections contribute systemic natural
immunity underestimate vaccination impact high proportion genital
infections originate extragenital infections. current understanding of
heterosexual hpv transmission immunity, substantial bias using
uni-site models predicting vaccination effectiveness genital hpv
infection unlikely occur.
