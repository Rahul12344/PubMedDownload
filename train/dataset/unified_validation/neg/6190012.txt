long terminal repeat enhancement v-mos transforming activity: identification
of essential regions.

wood tg, mcgeady ml, blair dg, vande woude gf.

the transforming efficiency recombinant dna clones containing moloney
sarcoma virus v-mos sequence enhanced introducing moloney sarcoma
virus long terminal repeat (ltr) either 5' 3' position relative to
v-mos. analyzed polyadenylated rna expressed cells transformed these
recombinant dna clones examined structural integrity integrated copies
of dna. case, demonstrated presence v-mos containing rna
transcripts polyadenylated rna showed rna transcripts are
consistent structure transfected dna. analysis dna from
these transformed cells showed relative positions v-mos ltr
sequences within transfected dna conserved integrated dna copies.
these results demonstrate single ltr successfully enhance the
transforming activity v-mos either 5' 3' relative position. the
results transfection analysis recombinant clones containing only
portions ltr introduced 3' v-mos demonstrate essential region 
of ltr responsible enhancement transformation region within
the unique 3' sequences ltr containing 73-base-pair tandem repeat
sequence.
