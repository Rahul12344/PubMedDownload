background: non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis) an
important component antiretroviral therapy hiv type-1 (hiv-1)-infected
patients. development nnrti resistance lead treatment failure is
conferred presence specific resistance-associated mutations (rams) in
the reverse transcriptase. addition widely used list nnrti rams
provided international aids society-usa hiv-1 drug resistance mutation
group, identified basis clinical experience the
approved nnrtis, comprehensive list nnrti rams needed guide the
study baseline emerging resistance new nnrtis.
methods: conducted extensive review existing literature nnrti
resistance, together several vitro vivo studies mechanism
of hiv-1 resistance approved nnrtis nnrtis formerly currently in
clinical development.
results: total, 44 nnrti rams identified. included v90i, a98g,
l100i, k1o1e/p/q, k103h/n/s/t, v106a/i/m, v108i, e138g/k/q, v179d/e/f/g/i,
y181c/i/v, y188c/h/l, v189i, g190a/c/e/q/s, h221y, p225h, f227c/l, m230i/l,
p236l, k238n/t y318f. nnrti rams observed, either alone in
combination others, ranging frequency 0.02% 56.96% panel 
101,679 nnrti-resistant isolates submitted virco bvba (mechelen, belgium) 
routine clinical resistance testing. phenotypical data site-directed mutants
helped establish contribution mutation nnrti resistance.
conclusions: list 44 nnrti rams compiled study provides a
comprehensive overview mutations play role hiv-1 nnrti resistance
and used guide vitro vivo research mechanisms 
of hiv-1 nnrti resistance.
