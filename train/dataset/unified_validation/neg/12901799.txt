the present study carried characterize causative genetic mutation 
in medium-sized malaysian chinese pedigree three generations affected with
familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). clinical data genetic studies revealed 
considerable phenotypic variability affected individuals family. blood
was obtained members fap-01 family genomic dna extracted.
mutation screening adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) gene carried out
using single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) technique. the
possibility exon skipping predicted splicing motif recognition software
(esefinder release2.0). sscp results showed mobility shifts exon 8 apc 
gene segregated affected members family. sequence analysis
revealed affected individuals heterozygous c847t transition,
whilst unaffected family members control individuals homozygous c
at position. nucleotide substitution generates stop codon at
amino acid position 283, place usual arginine (arg283ter). conclude 
that arg283ter mutation apc gene causative fap phenotype in
this family, although considerable variation presentation this
disease among affected individuals. computational analysis predicts this
mutation occurs within sequences may function splicing signals, that
the sequence change may affect normal splicing.
