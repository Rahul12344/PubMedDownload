in study defined vitro requirements transcriptional
regulation hiv-2 ltr response hiv-1 hiv-2 tat proteins and
addressed potential mechanisms tat function. hiv-2 contains duplicated tar
rna stem-loop structure contrast single stem-loop structure found in
hiv-1 tar rna. demonstrated hiv-2 proximal tar rna stem-loop
structure important vitro transcriptional activation hiv-1
and hiv-2 tat proteins distal tar rna stem-loop though downstream
tar element able confer tat-responsiveness. role two
hiv-2 tar rna stem-loop bulge sequences less critical loop sequences
for vitro transcriptional activation tat. addition, demonstrated that
replacing hiv-2 tata element hiv-1 markedly reduced overall 
level tat activation. role tat-1 tat-2 proteins the
synthesis hiv-1 hiv-2 promoter proximal promoter distal transcripts
was investigated. contrast hiv-1 promoter, hiv-2 promoter
generated abundant levels short transcripts vitro transcription assays
likely due structure duplicated tar element. tat-1 tat-2
increased level transcripts extending end hiv-1 hiv-2
tar elements well level transcripts extending 500
nucleotides transcription initiation site. however, synthesis of
transcripts within 30 nucleotides hiv-2 ltr transcription initiation site 
was unchanged either presence absence tat level of
transcripts extending increasing distances hiv-2 ltr transcription
initiation site progressively stimulated presence tat. though 
hiv-1 tat protein stronger inducer hiv-1 ltr transcription the
hiv-2 tat protein, detect differences binding proteins
to hiv-1 hiv-2 tar rnas. suggested differences their
transactivation properties may due alterations association with
rna polymerase ii associated elongation factors. (abstract truncated 250
