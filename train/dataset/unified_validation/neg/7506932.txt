previously [daube, s.s., & von hippel, p.h. (1992) science 258, 1320] have
shown functional transcription elongation complexes formed adding 
ribonucleotide triphosphates, mg2+, either escherichia coli t7 rna
polymerase synthetic rna-dna bubble-duplex constructs. observations
are extended show rna transcripts synthesized these
bubble-duplex constructs properly displaced dna template during
transcription. details displacement process differ the
polymerases tested. thus transcript fully processively displaced in
the course t7 polymerase-catalyzed synthesis bubble-duplex
constructs, presence large excess rna (or dna) oligomer
complementary dna template sequence within "permanent" dna bubble is
required attain complete displacement nascent rna construct
during synthesis core e. coli enzyme. addition, correlation is
shown proper rna displacement achievement full-length
transcript synthesis. conclude t7 polymerase e. coli
core enzyme actively displace nascent transcript elongation that
the requirement rna trap e. coli enzyme reflects slower rate 
of synthesis. suggests experiments may provide insight the
relative rates transcript elongation secondary structure formation within 
the nascent rna elongation termination. use rna oligomer trap
methodology, multiple rounds transcript synthesis achievable on
these bubble-duplex constructs polymerase.
