peripheral blood lymphocytes b-cells obtained patients with
myasthenia gravis stimulated vitro either pokeweed mitogen or
epstein-barr virus (ebv), respectively. ebv stimulation b-cells caused a
production antibodies acetylcholine receptor 15 25 myasthenia
gravis patients: ebv stimulation b-cells effective regard
than pokeweed mitogen stimulation peripheral blood lymphocytes. in
vitro synthesis anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies found be
positively correlated patients' sera antibody titers the
disease severity.
