swabbing surface genital lesion obtain sample hpv dna testing
is less invasive biopsy, may represent hpv types present the
lesion tissue. objective study examine concordance hpv 
types detected swab biopsy samples 165 genital lesions men ages 
18-70. lesions included 90 condyloma, 10 penile intraepithelial neoplasia (pein),
23 non-condyloma known histology, 42 lesions undetermined
histology. lesions sampled swabbing surface lesion 
pre-wetted dacron swab taking shave biopsy. hpv genotyping performed
using linear array swab samples inno-lipa biopsy samples. kappa
and mcnemar statistics used compare concordance detecting hpv
types swab biopsy samples. sampling methods high agreement for
detection hpv dna condyloma (87.8% agreement) pein (100% agreement).
there also high concordance detection hpv16 (kappa = 1.00) hpv18
(kappa = 1.00) pein, however, agreement low moderate detecting hpv6
(kappa = 0.31) hpv11 (kappa = 0.56) condyloma. low moderate agreement
was also observed sampling methods detecting individual hpv types 
the non-condyloma lesions indefinite histology. results suggest
that obtaining biopsy addition swabbing surface lesion may
provide additional information specific hvp types associated male
genital lesions.
