background: small hepatocellular carcinoma (shcc) special type of
hepatocellular carcinoma maximum tumor diameter ≤ 3 cm excellent
long-term outcomes. however, prognostic factors shcc remain
controversial. purpose study clarify predictive factors 
shcc.
methods: study population consisted 458 patients underwent hepatectomy for
single shcc january 2006 december 2008. clinical data (included age, 
gender, virus infection, serum alfa-fetoprotein level, cirrhosis, capsule,
border), histopathologic features (included differentiation, morphology subtype, 
microvascular invasion, tumor infiltrative lymphocytes (til), inflammatory injury
grade fibrosis stage surrounding liver), evaluated identify
prognostic factors influencing shcc patients' survival microvascular
invasion.
results: 384 males (83.8%) 74 (16.2%) females median ages 
52 years. median progression-free survival (pfs) overall survival (os)
durations 53 54 months, respectively. 91.9% (n = 421) shcc were
infected hepatitis b. one hundred forty-seven 446 (33.0%) patients with
pre-operation serum afp level record serum alfa-fetoprotein (afp) level ≥ 200
ug/ml 178 280 (63.8%) patients post-operation serum afp level
record afp level ≥ 20 ug/ml. liver cirrhosis present 411 cases
(89.7%), 434 (97.3%) tumors clear border, 250 (55.6%) tumors were
encapsulated.mvi identified 83 patients (18.1%). univariate analysis, a
significant association presence mvi shortened pfs os 
found (p = 0.012, 0.028, respectively). histological differentiation strong
relationship mvi (p = 0.009), terms mvi easily presented in
patients worse histological differentiation. patients mvi, worse
survival correlated female patients, patients g2 g3 histological
differentiation, pre-operation serum afp level ≥ 200 ug/ml post-operation
serum afp level ≥ 20 ug/ml, til ≥ 50/hpf.
conclusions: mvi independent poorer prognostic factor pfs os of
single shcc patients. tumor histological differentiation closely related with
mvi.
