the basal ganglia (bg) promote complex sequential movements helping select 
elementary motor gestures appropriate given behavioral context. indeed,
huntington's disease (hd), causes striatal atrophy bg, is
characterized hyperkinesia chorea. striatal cell loss alters activity 
in bg downstream motor cortical regions cause disorganized
movements remains unknown. here, show expressing genetic mutation
that causes hd song-related region songbird bg destabilizes syllable 
sequences increases overall vocal activity, leave structure of
individual syllables intact. behavioral changes paralleled the
selective loss striatal neurons reduction inhibitory synapses on
pallidal neurons serve bg output. chronic recordings singing birds
revealed disrupted temporal patterns activity pallidal neurons and
downstream cortical neurons. moreover, reversible inactivation cortical
neurons rescued disorganized vocal sequences transfected birds. these
findings shed light key role temporal patterns cortico-bg activity 
the regulation complex motor sequences show genetic mutation alters 
cortico-bg networks cause disorganized movements.
