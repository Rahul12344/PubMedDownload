the efficacy levulinic acid (lva) combination sodium dodecyl sulfate
(sds) removal foodborne viruses, enteric bacterial pathogens their
surrogates fresh strawberries investigated. inoculated strawberries were
treated potable water, sodium hypochlorite solution (50ppm), 0.5% lva plus
0.5% sds solution, 5% lva plus 2% sds solution respectively 2min,
followed spray-rinsing potable water. water washing removed least
1.0-log tested viral bacterial strains strawberries'
surfaces. 50ppm chlorine wash induced 3.4, 1.5 2.1-log reductions for
hepatitis virus (hav), murine norovirus-1 (mnv-1) ms2 bacteriophage,
respectively. comparison, tested bacterial strains showed uniform
reductions around 1.6-log cfu/ml. 0.5% lva plus 0.5% sds wash induced 2.7,
1.4 2.4-log reductions hav, mnv-1 ms2, comparable the
reductions induced chlorine (p>0.05). bacteria, 2.0-log reductions
were obtained enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes salmonella,
while escherichia coli o157:h7 escherichia coli p1 showed reductions 1.9
and 1.8-log cfu/ml. higher concentration lva plus sds showed significantly 
higher reductions (p>0.05). sensory tests washed strawberries chemical
residue analysis lva strawberries washing also performed. in
conclusion, study demonstrates good performance 0.5% lva plus 0.5% sds to
reduce levels enteric pathogens present strawberries without
altering taste introducing chemical safety issues.
