viable counts three strains vibrio vulnificus phage determined
during exposure mechanical gastrointestinal model without antacid
for 9 h 37 degrees c. v. vulnificus eliminated (>4-log reduction) within
30 min gastric compartment (ph decline 5.0 3.5). viable v.
vulnificus cells delivered gastric compartment first 30 min
of exposure reached 10(6) 10(8) cfu/ml intestinal compartment 9 h
(ph 7.0). phages eliminated within 45 min gastric compartment (ph
decline 5.1 2.5). less 2-log reduction phage observed in
the intestinal compartment 9 h (ph 7.0). gastric compartment
contained antacid v. vulnificus counts decreased slightly (<2 log) 2 h 
exposure (ph decline 7.7 6.0), counts intestinal compartment
(ph 7.5) reached 10(7) 10(9) cfu/ml. phage numbers decreased 1 log 2 h
in gastric compartment (ph decline 7.7 5.7) containing antacid and
decreased 1 log intestinal compartment (ph 7.6) 9 h. presence of
antacid gastric compartment model greatly increased ability 
both v. vulnificus phage survive simulated gastrointestinal transit
and may factor involved oyster-associated illness.
