the sv40 enhancer composed multiple functional elements compensate
for one another.

herr w, clarke j.

we present evidence sv40 enhancer consists three functional units, a,
b, c, cooperate others duplicates of
itself enhance transcription. show that, element c, containing the
core consensus sequence, inactivated point mutations, revertants with
restored enhancer function contain duplications either one the
elements b. search additional elements, isolated revertants 
mutant three elements mutated. revertants identify any
other elements; instead, enhancer function effectively restored "double
duplications," first duplication event either partially entirely 
recreates one three elements a, b, c second duplication then
creates two copies newly created sequence.
