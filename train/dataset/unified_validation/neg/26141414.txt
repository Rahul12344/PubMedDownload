objectives: human papillomavirus (hpv) infection major cause premalignant
dysplasia cervical cancer. data prevalence of
genotype-specific hpv infection assessed hpv e6/e7 mrna women
representative korean population across broad age range.
methods: total 630 women aged 17-90 years enrolled study.
thinprep liquid-based cytology samples evaluated using cervicgen hpv
rt-qdx assay, detects 16 high-risk (hr) hpv genotypes (set 1: hpv 16, 31,
33, 35, 52, 58; set 2: hpv 18, 39, 45, 51, 59, 68; set 3: hpv 53, 56,
66, 69).
results: overall prevalence hpv infection 33.2% (n=209), oncogenic
high-risk hpv detected 75.9% (n=107) 141 women high-grade cervical
lesions. hpv 16 common hpv genotype among women high-grade
cervical lesions histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 
grade 2 (cin2+) republic korea (41.6%). among women aged over
30 years, 182/329 (55%) invasive cervical cancer 135 (74%) 
infected oncogenic hr-hpv types (in particular 25% hpv 16). among
patients diagnosed cin2+, positivity rate hr-hpv highest in
women aged 40-49 years.
conclusions: results suggest determination specific hpv
genotypes important evaluating potential impact preventive
measures, including use prophylactic vaccines, reducing burden of
cervical cancer.
