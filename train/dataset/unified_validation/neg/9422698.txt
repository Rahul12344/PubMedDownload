candidate mammalian odorant receptors first cloned 6 years ago. the
physiological function receptors initiating transduction olfactory
receptor neurons remains established. here, recombinant adenovirus was
used drive expression particular receptor gene increased number 
sensory neurons rat olfactory epithelium. electrophysiological recording
showed increased expression single gene led greater sensitivity a
small subset odorants.
