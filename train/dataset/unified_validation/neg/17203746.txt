conglutinin, collectin-43 (cl-43) collectin-46 (cl-46) serum proteins
characteristic bovidae. belong collectins--family oligomeric
proteins composed trimeric subunits containing collagen-like sequences joined 
to c-type lectin domains. genes encoding conglutinin, cl-43 cl-46 are
located bovine chromosome 28, phylogenetic analysis indicates their
common origin--from lung surfactant protein gene. northern blot or
immunocytochemical analysis confirm biosynthesis bovine collectins mainly in
the liver (conglutinin, cl-43) thymus (cl-46). level of
conglutinin serum dairy cows depends many factors breeding, 
the season year, stage reproductive cycle infection. the
collectins involved innate immune defense. bind microbial
surface carbohydrates inducing aggregation and, thereby, impeding infectivity. on
the hand destruction pathogens occurs due stimulation effector
cells. cl-43 well conglutinin, binds collectin receptor (c1qr)
localized many types cells identified surface variant calreticulin.
conglutinin cl-43 show antiviral activities towards influenza virus and
rotaviruses. conglutinin also displays protective activity bacterial
infections.
