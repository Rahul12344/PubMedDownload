the late polyadenylation signal simian virus 40 functions greater
efficiency early polyadenylation signal, turn affecting steady-state 
mrna levels. two chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) transient expression
vectors, pl-epa pl-lpa, differ polyadenylation signals
were constructed using early late polyadenylation signals,
respectively. transfections cos, cv-1p, hela cells subsequent
northern blot analysis cat-specific rna, approximately five times more
steady-state cat mrna produced transfections pl-lpa pl-epa.
the basis difference related specific promoter used to
rna stability. overall, difference steady-state mrna levels derived from
the two plasmids appeared attributable intrinsic properties two
polyadenylation signals, resulting distinctly different cleavage and
polyadenylation efficiencies. additionally, found utilization 
late polyadenylation site dramatically reduced deletion sequences
between 48 29 nucleotides 5' aauaaa hexanucleotide. reduction 
mrna levels shown caused altered stability mutant precursor
rnas mrnas, suggesting upstream sequences constitute element 
the late polyadenylation signal may cause, least extent, the
greater efficiency utilization late polyadenylation site.
