synthetic carriers play important role immunogen presentation, due their
ability inducing improved specific responses conjugated epitopes. their
influence bioactive conformation epitope, though admittedly crucial
for relevant vitro vivo applications, difficult evaluate, given
the usual lack information complex conformational features determined
by nature carrier mode ligation. using herpes simplex
virus glycoprotein d-1 epitope
(leu(9)-lys-nle-ala-asp-pro-asn-arg-phe-arg-gly-lys-asp-leu(22)) model, we
have performed detailed conformational analysis free epitope peptide 
solution three constructs epitope conjugated to
sequential oligopeptide carriers {ac-[lys-aib-gly](4)-oh (soc(4))} (through
either thioether amide bond; ac: acetyl) polytuftsin oligomers
{h-[thr-lys-pro-lys-gly](4)-nh(2) (t20)}, (through thioether bond). the
analysis epitope conformation parent protein, carrier-conjugated
and free form, suggests beta-turn structure the
-asp(13)-pro-asn-arg(16)- segment highly conserved independent the
epitope form. however, small conformational variations observed the
c-terminal part epitope, depending nature carrier.
