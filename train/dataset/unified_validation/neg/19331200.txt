background: human leukocyte antigen (hla) class expression reportedly
frequently reduced cancer. examined heat-shock protein (hsp) expression 
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).
patients methods: hcv-related hcc examined 73 patients had
undergone hepatectomy, relationship hsp70 hla class i
expressions, clinicopathological factors survival evaluated.
results: immunohistochemically positive results hsp70 hla class were
seen 67 (92%) 43 cases (59%), respectively, 38 patients (52%) were
positive both. increased hsp70 immunoreactivity significantly associated 
with high histological grade tumor differentiation (p = 0.0179), whereas
reduced hla class immunoreactivity significantly associated large
tumor size (p = 0.0082). differences apparent disease-free and
overall survival regard expression levels.
conclusion: results suggest hsp70 expression may related tumor
differentiation hla class loss may occur tumor growth hcv-related
hcc.
