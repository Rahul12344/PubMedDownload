despite single stranded dna genomes replicated host dna
polymerases, viruses family geminiviridae apparently evolving as
rapidly rna viruses. observed substitution rates geminiviruses 
the genera begomovirus mastrevirus high entire family could
conceivably originated less million years ago (mya). however, the
existence geminivirus related dna (grd) integrated within genomes of
various nicotiana species suggests geminiviruses probably originated >10
mya. even suggested distinct new-world (nw) lineage of
begomoviruses may arisen following separation continental drift of
african american proto-begomoviruses ∼110 mya. evaluate various
geminivirus origin hypotheses using bayesian coalescent-based approaches date 
firstly nicotiana grd integration events, divergence nw
and old-world (ow) begomoviruses. besides rejecting possibility a<2 mya
ow-nw begomovirus split, could also discount may occurred
concomitantly breakup gondwanaland 110 mya. although could only
confidently narrow date split 2 80 mya, most
plausible (and best supported) date split 20 30 mya--a
