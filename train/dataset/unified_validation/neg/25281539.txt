to explore heterogeneity cd4 responses following highly active
antiretroviral therapy, patterns cd4 recovery hiv-1-infected chinese
patients first antiretroviral regimen ≥5 years were
analysed. cd4 trajectories traced, smoothed differentiated into
three defined profiles. half (56.3%) 'satisfactory responders', cd4
gain >100 cells/μl peak >350 cells/μl, plateauing end of
year 5. thirty-three (24.4%) 'continuing responders' whose cd4 rise
persisted year 4-5. remaining 26 (19.3%) 'poor responders'.
presentation aids therapy common among 'poor' also
paradoxically 'continuing' responders. majority responded well to
antiretroviral therapy, older patients aids diagnosis before
initiation therapy may never achieve satisfactory level even effective 
treatment. categorization hiv patients cd4 trajectory may support the
prediction immunological outcome time, ultimately inform treatment
choices.
