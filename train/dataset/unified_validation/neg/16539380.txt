the antiproliferative activity 14 isomeric monoxylosylated
dihydroxynaphthalenes tested vitro toward normal hfl-1 3t3 a31
cells well transformed t24 3t3 sv40 cells. antiproliferative effect
toward hfl-1 cells correlated polarity compounds. however, in
the case transformed t24 cells, compounds showed clearly different
behavior resulting selective antiproliferative effect. correlation
was found normal 3t3 a31 virus transformed 3t3 sv40 cells, the
free aglycon. results suggest antiproliferative activity shown 
naphthoxylosides diverse different cell lines dependent nature
of aglycon. antiproliferative effect of
2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)-beta-d-xylopyranoside, contrast inactive
2-naphthyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside, t24 cells accompanied increased
apoptosis indicated tunel assay.
