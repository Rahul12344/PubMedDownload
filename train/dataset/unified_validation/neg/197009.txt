biological characterization avian osteopetrosis.

banes aj, smith re.

chicks infected 12-day-old embryos end-point purified derivative of
avian myeloblastosis virus developed rapidly progressive osteopetrosis that
manifested within 1 week hatching. detailed comparison osteopetrotic
chicks normal hatchmates revealed following. (i) osteopetrotic chicks
exhibited stunting syndrome, growing mean rate 26% control
rats. (ii) autopsy, mass lymphoid organs reduced, whereas the
mass heart, pancreas, kidneys, lungs, brain, liver, bones of
osteopetrotic chicks increased. edema likely responsible 
increase organ weight. (iii) infected chicks exhibited normochromic,
normocytic anemia virus dose dependent required the
development osteopetrosis. (iv) bone collagen content normal. (v)
osteopetrotic bone initially hypomineralized, later became fully
mineralized. (vi) concentrations alpha, beta, gamma globulins the
plasma elevated osteopetrotic chicks, whereas albumin concentration was
decreased. (vii) level plasma alkaline phosphatase elevated in
osteopetrotic chicks, yet level acid phosphatase unchanged. (viii)
body bone temperatures unchanged.
