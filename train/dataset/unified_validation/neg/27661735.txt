h7n7 avian influenza viruses widely detected wild birds domestic
poultry since first detected chickens italy 1902. can
occasionally transmit humans. here, isolated six h7n7 viruses live
poultry markets routine surveillance 2010 2013. sequences analysis
revealed viruses reassortants bearing genes h3n8, h7n3, h7n7,
and h10n7 influenza viruses detected wild birds ducks, be
categorized three genotypes (a, b, c). six viruses bound both
human-type avian-type receptors. viruses genotype b c could
replicate efficiently lungs nasal turbinates mice without prior
adaptation, genotype c virus also replicated brain two three
mice tested. important continue monitor evolution h7n7 viruses
and evaluate potential cause human infections.
