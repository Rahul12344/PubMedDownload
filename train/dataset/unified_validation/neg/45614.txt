some physico-chemical properties dnas released actinophages sh3, 
sh10, sh11, sh12 described. four phage dnas linear
double-stranded secondary structure unique respect high g.c
contents which, melting studies buoyant density experiments, found 
to range 68-73 mol-%. dna molecular weights determined by
sedimentation velocity experiments electron microscopic length
measurements, mean values two corresponding data sets 34.0 x
10(6) (sh3), 26.7 x 10(6) (sh10), 26.1 x 10(6) (sh11), 28.7 x 10(6) (sh12)
with mean relative error +/- 5%. different observations was
concluded sh10 dna, possibly also sh11 sh12 dna, cohesive ends 
and undergo intramolecular intermolecular association form ring-like
monomers linear ring-like multimers. cleavage dnas sh3, sh10,
sh11, sh12 ecori restriction endonuclease delivered two, one, zero, and
two cleavage sites, respectively, bamhi restriction endonuclease eight,
zero, zero, zero cleavage sites, respectively.
