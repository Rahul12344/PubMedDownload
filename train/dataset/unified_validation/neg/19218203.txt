glycoprotein b (gb) homologues within herpesvirus family display high
sequence conservation, number gb homologues contain cleavage motif
r-x-k/r-r recognized cellular protease furin. epstein-barr virus (ebv) gb 
contains motif cleaved gb found ebv virions. determine the
functional significance cleavage motif ebv gb, deletion mutant (gb
deltafurin) created lacking motif. cleavage mutant expressed
well cell culture cleaved. experiments examining gb deltafurin 
a cell-fusion assay revealed fusion reduced 52 % epithelial 28
% b cells compared wild-type ebv gb. decrease cell-cell
fusion similar observed multiple alphaherpesvirus gb cleavage
mutants supports conserved function cleaved gb.
