hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) contributes 14.8% cancer mortality in
egypt, high prevalence hepatitis c virus (hcv). previously
shown alterations insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) receptor signalling
pathway experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. aim study to
determine whether serum levels igf-1, igf-2 igfbp-3 used to
discriminate hcc stages hepatic dysfunction patients with
liver cirrhosis assessed child-pugh (cp) score, correlate these
levels hcc stages. recruited 241 subjects present study; 79 with
liver cirrhosis, 62 hcv-induced hcc 100 age-matched controls. results
showed serum levels igf-1, igf-2 igfbp-3 reduced significantly
in cirrhosis hcc patients comparison controls, this
reduction negatively correlated cp scores. however, igfbp-3 levels 
showed significant negative correlation Î±-fetoprotein levels. reduction 
in igf-1 igfbp-3 igf-2 levels significant hcc comparison to
patients cirrhosis. none parameters significantly correlated the
hcc stage. igfbp-3 levels discriminated cirrhosis hcc a
sensitivity 87%, specificity 80% cut-off value <682.6 ng/ml. 
conclusion, although results showed serum igf-1, igf-2 igfbp-3 are
reduced progression hepatic dysfunction, igfbp-3 may be
considered promising serological marker prediction the
development hcc chronic hcv patients liver cirrhosis.
