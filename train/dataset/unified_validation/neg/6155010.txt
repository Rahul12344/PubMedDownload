the mathematical model phagolytic process proposed, taking account the
preexponential phase growth biomass bacteria phages. this

synthesis phage bacterial proteins. proceeding comparison with
experiments e. coli corresponding phage, numerical values the
constants model determined one optimization methods. the
comparison theoretical calculations results experimental studies
showed mathematical model correctly described dynamics of
phagolysis qualitative quantitative aspects.
