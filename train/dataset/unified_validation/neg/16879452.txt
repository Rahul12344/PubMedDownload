novel therapeutic approaches needed combat rapid increase hiv
sexual transmission women. probiotic organism lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 
which safely colonizes human vagina prevents microbial infections, has
been genetically modified produce anti-hiv proteins capable of
blocking three main steps hiv entry human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. hiv entry fusion inhibitors fused native
expression secretion signals bspa, mlp sep l. reuteri rc-14 
expression cassettes stably inserted chromosome. l. reuteri rc-14
expressed hiv inhibitors cell wall-associated secreted forms. l.
reuteri rc-14 expressing cd4d1d2-antibody-like fusion proteins able bind 
single dual tropic coreceptor-using hiv-1 primary isolates. first 
study show well-documented proven human vaginal probiotic strain
can express potent functional viral inhibitors, may potentially lower the
sexual transmission hiv.
