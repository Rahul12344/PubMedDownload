in study applied epitope excision epitope extraction strategies,
combined matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, to
determine fine structure epitopes recognized polyclonal antibody to
human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein gp120. first
application approach epitope mapping large, heavily glycosylated 
protein. epitope excision method, gp120 native form first bound 
to antibody immobilized sepharose beads cleaved endoproteinase
enzymes. epitope extraction method, gp120 first proteolytically
cleaved allowed react immobilized antibody. fragments
that remain bound antibody, repeated washing remove unbound
peptides, contain antigenic region recognized antibody, and
the bound peptides methods characterized direct analysis the
immobilized antibody matrix assisted laser desorption ionization/mass
spectrometry. study carried epitope excision extraction
experiments three different enzymes identified residues 472-478 
a major epitope. addition, antigenic regions containing minor epitopes have
also identified.
