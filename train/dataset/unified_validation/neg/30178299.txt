the human tumor suppressor smarcb1/ini1/snf5/baf47 (snf5) core subunit of
the multi-subunit atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex swi/snf, also known 
as brahma/brahma-related gene 1 (brm/brg1)-associated factor (baf). experimental 
studies swi/snf currently considerably limited low cellular
abundance complex; thus, recombinant protein production represents key 
to obtain swi/snf proteins molecular structural studies. the
expression mammalian proteins bacteria often difficult, the
baculovirus/insect cell expression system overcome limitations prokaryotic
expression systems facilitate co-expression multiple proteins. here,
we demonstrate human full-length snf5 tagged c-terminal 3 × flag 
be expressed purified insect cell extracts monomeric dimeric
forms. end, constructed set donor acceptor vectors the
expression individual proteins protein complexes baculovirus/insect
cell expression system control polyhedrin (polh), p10, a
minimal drosophila melanogaster hsp70 promoter. show snf5 expression 
level could modulated selection promoter used control
expression. vector set also comprises vectors encode 3 × flag tag,
twin-strep tag, cbp-3 × flag-tev-proteina triple tag facilitate affinity
selection detection. gel filtration split-ubiquitin assays, show
that human full-length snf5 ability self-interact. overall, the
toolbox developed herein offers possibility flexibly select promoter

expression chromatin remodeling factors challenging proteins.
