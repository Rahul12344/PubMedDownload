in view persistent threat mankind, development nucleotide-based
prodrugs hepatitis c virus (hcv) considered constant effort in
many medicinal chemistry groups. attempt identify novel nucleoside
phosphoramidate analogues improving anti-hcv activity, explored, 
for first time, aspartic acid (asp) iminodiacetic acid (ida) esters as
amidate counterparts considering three 2'-c-methyl containing nucleosides,
2'-c-me-cytidine, 2'-c-me-uridine 2'-c-me-2'-fluoro-uridine. synthesis of
these analogues required protection vicinal diol functionality the
sugar moiety amino group cytidine nucleoside regioselectively
perform phosphorylation reaction 5'-hydroxyl group. anti-hcv data
demonstrate asp-based phosphoramidates âˆ¼550 fold potent than
the parent nucleosides. inhibitory activity asp-protides higher
than ala-protides, suggesting asp would potential amino acid
candidate considered developing novel antiviral prodrugs.
