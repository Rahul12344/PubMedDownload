since 2010, variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) the
etiological agent responsible outbreak porcine epidemic diarrhea (ped)
worldwide. study, variant pedv strain yn1 isolated, serially
propagated vero cells characterized 200 passages. better
elucidate molecular basis vero cell adaptation variant pedv strains, we
sequenced, compared, analyzed full-genome sequences parental yn1 and
passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, 200. results showed variations
increased viral passage. nucleotides sequences non-structural
protein (nsp)2, nsp4-7, nsp10, nsp12 nsp13 genes change the
vero cell adaptation process. comparison variation characteristic of
classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, found attenuation 
pedv virus associated 9-26 amino acid (aa) changes open reading
frames (orf) 1a/b protein, early termination orf3, 1-3 aa changes e, 
m n protein nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations. aa
deletion 144 aa protein could attenuation marker the
pedv. pig study showed early termination orf3 important 
for virus cell adaptation virus attenuation.
