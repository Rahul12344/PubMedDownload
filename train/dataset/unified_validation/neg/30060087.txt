background: anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsils) ablation may
reduce incidence invasive cancer, data exist treatment efficacy
and natural regression without treatment.
methods: open-label, randomized, multisite clinical trial human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected adults aged ≥27 years 1-3
biopsy-proven anal hsils (index hsils) without prior history hsil treatment
with infrared coagulation (irc). participants randomized 1:1 hsil
ablation irc (treatment) treatment (active monitoring [am]).
participants followed every 3 months high-resolution anoscopy.
treatment participants underwent anal biopsies suspected new recurrent
hsils. participants underwent biopsies month 12. primary end
point complete clearance index hsil month 12.
results: randomized 120 participants. complete index hsil clearance occurred
more frequently treatment group (62% vs 30%; risk
difference, 32%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 13%-48%; p < .001). complete or
partial clearance (clearance ≥1 index hsil) occurred commonly the
treatment group (82% vs 47%; risk difference, 35%; 95% ci, 16%-50%; p < .001).
having single index lesion, compared 2-3 lesions, significantly
associated complete clearance (relative risk, 1.96; 95% ci, 1.22-3.10). 
most common adverse events related treatment mild moderate anal pain
and bleeding. serious adverse events deemed related treatment study
participation.
conclusion: irc ablation anal hsils results clearance hsils than
observation alone.
