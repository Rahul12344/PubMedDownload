epstein-barr virus (ebv) encodes bamhia rightward transcript (bart) micrornas
(mirnas). mirnas expressed high levels epithelial tumors, as
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc). bart mirnas play important roles in
ebv-associated malignancies, however, reason high expression npc
is unclear. performed multiple sequence alignment six completely sequenced 
ebv strains: akata, yccel1, snu719, c666-1, mutu i, m81. single-nucleotide 
deletion identified promoter region bart. luciferase assay
suggested single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) significantly increased 
bart promoter activity. addition deletion, substitution site
also increased bart promoter activity. analysis 170 ebv genome sequences
from npc ebv-associated gastric cancers revealed frequency this
snp associated npc incidence snp found accumulated in
the bart promoter region. overall, results suggested snp should
enhance bart promoter activity thus, might contribute development of
ebv-associated epithelial malignancies.
