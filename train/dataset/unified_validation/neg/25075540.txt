american black bears (ursus americanus) maryland, usa, live forested areas 
in close proximity humans domestic pets. 1999 2011, we
collected 84 serum samples 63 black bears (18 males; 45 females) five
maryland counties tested exposure infectious, including zoonotic,
pathogens. large portion bears antibody canine distemper virus
and toxoplasma gondii, many high titers. prevalences antibodies zoonotic
agents rabies virus infectious agents carnivores including
canine adenovirus canine parvovirus lower. bears also antibodies 
vector-borne pathogens common bears humans west nile virus,
borrelia burgdorferi, rickettsia rickettsii, anaplasma phagocytophilum.
antibodies detected leptospira interrogans serovars pomona,
icterohaemorrhagiae, canicola, grippotyphosa, bratislava. detect
antibodies brucella canis ehrlichia canis. although population of
maryland black bears demonstrated exposure multiple pathogens concern for
humans domesticated animals, low levels clinical disease and
other free-ranging black bear populations indicate black bear likely a
spillover host majority pathogens studied. nevertheless, bear
populations living human-domestic-wildlife interface increasing human
and domestic animal exposure continue monitored this
population likely serves useful sentinel ecosystem health.
