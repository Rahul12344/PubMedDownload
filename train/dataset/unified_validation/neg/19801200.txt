background: novel swine-origin influenza h1n1 virus (s-oiv) causes the
current pandemic. tissue tropism replication different cell lines 
not well understood.
objective: compare growth characteristics cell lines infected s-oiv,
seasonal influenza h1n1 (sh1n1) avian influenza h5n1 (h5n1) viruses and
the effect temperature viral replication.
study design: cytopathic effect (cpe), antigen expression immunofluorescence
(if) viral load profile quantitative rt-pcr 17 cell lines infected by
s-oiv, sh1n1 h5n1 examined. comparison replication efficiency
in chick embryo performed. effect temperature viral replication 
madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells determined tcid(50) 33 degrees
c, 37 degrees c 39 degrees c 5 consecutive days.
results: s-oiv replicated cell lines derived different tissues organs 
and host species comparable viral load sh1n1. among 13 human cell lines
tested, caco-2 highest viral load s-oiv. s-oiv showed low viral
load cpe antigen expression pig kidney cell pk-15, h5n1
demonstrated diverse cell tropism cpe antigen expression, the
highest viral replication efficiency cell lines allantoic fluid. 
three viruses demonstrated best growth 37 degrees c mdck cells.
conclusion: cell line growth characteristics s-oiv, sh1n1 h5n1 appear to
correlate clinically pathologically involved anatomical sites and
severity. low replication s-oiv pk-15 suggests virus more
adapted human swine.
