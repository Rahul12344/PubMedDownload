objectives: pulmonary infiltrates allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (allo-hsct) patients potentially life-threatening require
early diagnosis treatment. aimed retrospectively explore clinical
efficacy polymerase chain reaction (pcr) conjunction flexible
bronchoscopy (fb) allo-hsct patients pulmonary infiltrates.
patients methods: retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing fb
after allo-hsct peking university institute hematology january
2013 december 2016. used pcr detect various viruses fb specimens,
particularly 27 viruses.
results: one hundred forty-nine diagnostic fbs performed 130 patients.
the overall diagnostic yield 58%. eighty-nine percent patients 
positive fb result diagnosed pulmonary infection. viruses the
most common infectious diagnosis (70%), followed fungi (48%), bacteria (38%), 
and pneumocystis jirovecii (12%). multivariate analyses showed chest
computed tomography (ct) finding diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (p = .012) 
positive results assisted microbiological serological analyses (p = .000) 
predicted positive fb result. fb results prompted treatment modification in
61% cases.
conclusions: fb conjunction pcr efficient rapid diagnosis and
management pulmonary infiltrates allo-hsct patients.
