medical therapy patients malignancy requires paradigm shift through
development new drugs good safety record novel mechanisms of
activity. dearth molecules, one particular agent,
"reovirus" promising ability target cancer cells aberrant
signaling pathways. double-stranded rna virus therapeutically
formulated rapidly progressed preclinical validation anticancer
activity phase iii registration study platinum refractory metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma head neck. process, reovirus has
shown safety single agent administered intratumorally and
intravenously, well combination therapy, multiple chemotherapeutics
such gemcitabine, carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel; similarly with
radiation. scientific rationale development anticancer agent
stems fact preferentially replicates induces lyses of
cells activated kras pathway. documented many previous studies, the
initial observation greater tropism kras-compromised situation might
certainly sole possibly even predominant reason for
enhanced virulence. same, scientists emphasized kras
optimistically due high prevalence various types cancers. incidence 
of kras mutation found highest pancreatic cancer (85%-90%)
followed colorectal (35-45%) lung (25-30%). reovirus, fact the
potential therapy also tool unravel aberrant
cellular pathway leading carcinogenicity.
