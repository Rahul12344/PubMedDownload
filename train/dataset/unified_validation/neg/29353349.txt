daclatasvir first-in-class, highly selective, hepatitis c virus,
non-structural protein 5a polymerase replication complex inhibitor picomolar
potency broad genotypic coverage vitro. daclatasvir undergoes rapid
absorption, time reach maximum plasma concentration 1-2 h an
elimination half-life of ~ 10 14 h observed single-ascending dose studies. 
steady state achieved day 4 multiple-ascending dose studies.
daclatasvir administered without regard food ph modifiers.
daclatasvir exposure similar healthy subjects subjects infected
with hepatitis c virus. intrinsic factors age, race, sex impact
daclatasvir exposure. dose adjustment necessary patients any
degree hepatic renal impairment. daclatasvir low-to-moderate clearance 
with predominant route elimination via cytochrome p450 3a4-mediated
metabolism p-glycoprotein excretion intestinal secretion. renal clearance
is minor route elimination daclatasvir. result, dose of
daclatasvir reduced 60 30 mg daily co-administered
with strong inhibitors cytochrome p450 3a4. dose adjustment required
when daclatasvir co-administered moderate inhibitors cytochrome p450
3a4. dose daclatasvir increased 60 90 mg daily when
co-administered moderate inducers cytochrome p450 3a4. co-administration 
of daclatasvir strong inducers cytochrome p450 3a4 contraindicated.
concurrent medications inhibitory effects p-glycoprotein without
concurrent inhibition cytochrome p450 3a4 unlikely cause marked changes
in daclatasvir exposure, clearance daclatasvir both

weak-to-moderate inhibitor transporters including organic cation transporter
