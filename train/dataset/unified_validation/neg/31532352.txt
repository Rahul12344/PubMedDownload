potato virus (pvy; potyviridae) continuing challenge potato production
owing increasing popularity strain-specific resistant cultivars.
hypersensitive resistance (hr) one type plant defense responses restrict
virus spread. many potato cultivars, cultivar premier russet (pr),
local necrosis site infection protects common pvyo
strain, hr often fails restrain necrotic strains, spread
systemically. here, established role callose accumulation the
strain-specific resistance responses pvy infection. first uncovered that
pvy, independent strain, naturally capable suppressing
pathogenesis-related callose formation susceptible host. activity can
be dissociated viral replication transient expression the
viral-encoded helper component proteinase (hcpro) protein, identifying 
pathogen elicitor. however, unlike necrotic strain, pvyo its
corresponding hcpro unable block callose accumulation resistant pr
potatoes, observed abundance callose deposition the
inability virus spread. substitution eight amino acid residues
within hcpro c-terminal region differ pvyo pvyn strains 
were previously shown responsible eliciting hr response, are
sufficient restore ability hcproo suppress callose accumulation,
despite resistant host background, line new viral function in
pathogenicity.
