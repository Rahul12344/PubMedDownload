we propose ratios lymphocyte subsets: cd4+/cd8+, cd4+/cd3+, and
cd8+/cd3+, graphically displayed order, could easy way of
immunophenotyping simple form interpretation clinicians and
patients. total 187 asymptomatic hiv-positive patients, -including 83
symptomatic patients aids- normal comparative age group 36
patients, studied flow cytometry. ratios graphically displayed on
millimetric-grid paper, specific point given obtained ratio.
the points connected line. angles formed lines measured
and graphically displayed circle. point reference 0 degree was
located left side circle, giving corresponding 90 degrees, 180 
degrees, 240 degrees angles. graph control group shows "beach
chair" image. soon cd4+ lymphocytes diminish cd8+ lymphocytes
increase hiv+ patients, "the chair's headrest" descends "chair's
footpiece" swivels back. given ranks fluctuations lymphocyte
subsets, graphic display provides better representation the
immunological status.
