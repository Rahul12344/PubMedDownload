the tissue specificity mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) expression is
controlled regulatory elements mmtv long terminal repeat (ltr). these
regulatory elements include hormone response element, located approximately
between -200 -75, well binding sites nf-1, oct-1 (otf-1), and
mammary gland enhancer factors. naturally occurring mmtv deletion variants
isolated t-cell kidney tumors, transgenic-mouse experiments mmtv
ltr deletions, transient transfection assays ltr constructs indicate
that additional transcription regulatory elements, including negative
regulatory element (nre), located upstream hormone response element. to
further define regulatory region, constructed series bal 31
deletion mutants mmtv ltr use transient transfection assays. 
assays indicated deletion two regions (referred promoter-distal and
-proximal nres) -637 -201 elevated basal mmtv promoter activity in
the absence glucocorticoids. region -637 -264 surveyed for
the presence nuclear protein binding sites gel retardation assays. one
type protein complex (referred nre-binding protein nbp) bound
exclusively sites mapped promoter-distal -proximal nres
identified bal 31 mutations. promoter-proximal binding site mapped
further linker substitution mutations transfection assays. mutations 
mapped region containing inverted repeat beginning -287 relative to
the start transcription elevated basal expression reporter gene driven by
the mmtv ltr. 59-bp dna fragment distal nre also bound nbp
complex. gel retardation assays showed mutations within inverted
repeats proximal nre eliminated nbp binding mutations within single
repeats altered nbp binding. intriguingly, nbp complex detected in
extracts cells lung cells absent mammary gland cells.
these results suggest factor contributing high-level expression mmtv
in mammary gland lack negative regulation nbp.
