objective: hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (hph) increases lipid
peroxidation generation toxic aldehydes metabolized by
detoxifying enzymes, including aldh2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2). however, the
role lipid peroxidation aldh2 hph pathogenesis remain undefined.
approach results: determine role lipid peroxidation aldh2 in
hph, c57bl/6 mice, aldh2 transgenic mice, aldh2 knockout (aldh2-/-) mice were
exposed chronic hypoxia, recombinant tissue-specific aldh2 overexpression 
adeno-associated viruses introduced pulmonary arteries via tail vein
injection aldh2 overexpression. human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
were used elucidate underlying mechanisms vitro. chronic hypoxia promoted
lipid peroxidation due excessive production reactive oxygen species and
increased expression lipoxygenases lung tissues. 4-hydroxynonenal not
malondialdehyde level increased hypoxic lung tissues might reflect
differences detoxifying enzymes. aldh2 overexpression attenuated the
development hph, whereas aldh2 knockout aggravated it. specific overexpression
of aldh2 using aav1 (adeno-associated virus)-icam (intercellular adhesion
molecule) 2p-aldh2 aav2-sm22αp (smooth muscle 22 alpha)-aldh2 viral vectors
in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, prevented the
development hph. hypoxia 4-hydroxynonenal increased stabilization hif
(hypoxia-inducible factor)-1α, phosphorylation drp1 (dynamin-related protein
1) serine 616, mitochondrial fission, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
proliferation, whereas aldh2 activation suppressed latter 3.
conclusions: increased 4-hydroxynonenal level plays critical role the
development hph. aldh2 attenuates development hph regulating
mitochondrial fission smooth muscle cell proliferation suggesting aldh2 
potential new therapeutic target pulmonary hypertension.
