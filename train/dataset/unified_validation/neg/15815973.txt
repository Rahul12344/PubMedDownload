hiv-1 essential enzyme viral replication interesting target

l-731,988 one active molecules class beta-diketo acids. 
individual combined mutations hiv-1 residues t66, s153, m154
confer important degrees resistance one inhibitors belonging to
this class. effort understand molecular mechanism resistance 
of t66i/m154i inhibitor l-731,988 specific binding modes, we
have carried docking studies, explicit solvent md simulations, binding
free energy calculations. inhibitor docked different protein
conformations chosen prior md trajectories, resulting 2 major
orientations within active site. md simulations carried the
t66i/m154i dm in, dm complex l-731,988 2 different orientations,
and 1qs4 complex l-731,988. results simulations show a
similar dynamical behavior t66i/m154i alone complex with
l-731,988, significant differences observed mobility in
catalytic loop (residues 138-149). water molecules bridging inhibitor to
residues active site identified, residue gln62 been
found play important role interactions inhibitor the
protein. work provides information binding modes l-731,988, 
well insight mechanism inhibitor-resistance hiv-1 integrase.
