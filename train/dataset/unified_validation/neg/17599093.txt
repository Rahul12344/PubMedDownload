we previously reported reic/dkk-3, member dickkopf (dkk) gene
family, works tumor suppressor. study, evaluated therapeutic 
effects intratumoral injection adenoviral vector encoding reic/dkk-3
gene (ad-reic) using orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model rm-9 cells. 
also investigated vivo anti-metastatic effect vitro anti-invasion
effect ad-reic gene delivery. demonstrated ad-reic treatment
inhibited prostate cancer growth lymph node metastasis, prolonged mice
survival model. therapeutic responses consistent the
intratumoral apoptosis induction vitro suppression cell
invasion/migration reduced matrix metalloprotease-2 activity. thus
concluded situ ad-reic/dkk-3 gene transfer may promising therapeutic
intervention modality treatment prostate cancer.
