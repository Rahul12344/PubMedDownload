gill-associated virus (gav) nidovirus commonly infects penaeus monodon 
(black tiger shrimp) eastern australia, causing morbidity mortalities in
the acute stage disease. explored possibility inhibiting gav
replication disease using double-stranded (ds)rnas expressed bacteria 
delivered either orally muscle injection. enhance potential rna
interference (rnai) responses, 5 long dsrnas used targeted open reading
frame 1a/1b (orf1a/b) gene regions thus genomic length rna. to
examine oral delivery, p. monodon fed pellets incorporating pool of
formalin-fixed bacteria containing 5 gav-specific dsrnas being
injected minimal lethal gav dose. feeding pellets continued
post-challenge reduce mortality accumulation elevation gav
loads. contrast, muscle injection dsrnas purified bacteria was
highly effective slowing gav replication protecting shrimp acute
disease mortalities. synergy data, dsrna targeted p. monodon
beta-actin mrna caused 100% mortality following injection, whilst oral
delivery caused mortality. findings confirm injected dsrna mount
effective rnai responses p. monodon endogenous shrimp mrna exogenous
viral rnas, delivered orally bacteria feed component, same
dsrnas ineffective. efficacy rnai response gav provided by
injection dsrnas targeted multiple genome sites suggests strategy
might general applicability enhancing protection shrimp
single-stranded (ss)rna viruses, particularly hatcheries breeding programs 
where injection-based delivery systems practical.
