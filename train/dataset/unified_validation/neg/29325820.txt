a safety requirement live vaccines investigating possible shedding in
recipients since presence replication competent vaccine secretions
could result direct indirect horizontal transmission. especially
relevant oral rabies vaccine baits deliberately distributed the
environment. current study, survival oral rabies virus vaccine, spbn
gasgas, examined excretions different target non-target species; 
red fox, raccoon dog, small indian mongoose, raccoon, striped skunk, domestic
dog, domestic cat domestic pig. saliva - (pooled) fecal samples collected
at different time points oral administration vaccine strain were
examined presence viral rna (rt-pcr). pcr-positive subset of
pcr-negative samples subsequently investigated presence of
infectious virus isolation cell culture (rtcit). 7 days post vaccine 
administration viral rna could detected 50 758 fecal samples no
infectious virus detected examined pcr-positive fecal samples. 
in contrast, rna-fragments detected 248 1053 saliva swabs an
extended period (up 10 days) vaccine administration, viable virus
was present first hours post vaccine administration 38
samples. infectious vaccine virus isolated saliva swabs taken 24 h or
more vaccine administration. hence, active shedding vaccine virus
spbn gasgas oral administration occurred virus isolated 
initial hours material originally administered result virus
replication within host. thus, potential horizontal transmission this
vaccine virus limited short period directly vaccine bait uptake. it
can concluded environmental risks associated shedding after
distributing vaccine baits containing spbn gasgas negligible.
