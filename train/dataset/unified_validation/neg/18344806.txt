we conducted case-control study elucidate role heat shock protein a1b
(hspa1b) 1267 single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) risk prognosis of
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). subjects enrolled included 150 pairs sex- 
age-matched hcc patients unrelated controls. genomic dna typed for
hspa1b1267 snp using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length
polymorphism. frequencies hspa1b p2/p2 genotype hspa1b p2
allele hcc patients higher unrelated controls (each p = 0.0001). 
multivariate analysis identified following independent risk factors hcc: 
hspa1b p1/p2 genotype (odds ratio [or], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [ci],
1.07-5.11), hspa1b p2/p2 genotype (or, 12.06; 95% ci, 4.43-32.79), hepatitis b
surface antigen (hbsag) (or, 25.95; 95% ci, 11.88-56.68), antibodies to
hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv) (or, 70.43; 95% ci, 21.89-226.64). an
additive interaction hspa1b p2 allele carriers presence either
hbsag (synergy index = 2.48) anti-hcv (synergy index = 1.52). however, as
hspa1b1267 snp silent mutation, surrogate genetic marker for
increasing risk hcc. findings indicate patients chronic
hepatitis b/hepatitis c virus infection harbor snp represent high-risk
group hcc. receive intensive surveillance early
detection hcc. moreover, patients hspa1b p2 allele significantly 
longer survival (p = 0.002).the limitations study include unknown
functional significance hspa1b1267 polymorphism, relatively small
sample size, fact prospective study cases and
controls, questionable generalizability findings given the
specific ethnic composition population studied.
