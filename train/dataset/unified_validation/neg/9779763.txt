objective: human herpesviruses 6 7 (hhv-6 hhv-7) common infections in
children, risk factors early acquisition described.
methods: excess sera children 12 31 months age enrolled a
cross-sectional, random survey tested human herpesviruses 6 7
infection, measured using immuno-blot immunofluorescence assays.
results: 164 children 131 (80%) antibody hhv-6, 79 (47%) 167 had
antibody hhv-7. logistic regression analysis low income [odds ratio (or),
2.9; 95% confidence intervals (ci), 1.02 8.7] 1 sibling
(or=2.1, 95% ci=0.9 5.1) risk factors hhv-6 infection adjusting
for age, whereas month test (or=2.7, 95% ci=1.3 5.9) black race
(or=2.0, 95% ci=0.9, 4.6) associated higher prevalence hhv-7
infection. contrast ever breast-fed appeared protect against
hhv-7 infection (or=0.5, 95% ci=0.3 1.1).
conclusions: despite studies linking hhv-6 hhv-7 exanthem subitum, 
risk factors early acquisition hhv-6 hhv-7 distinct.
subsequent studies investigating transmission hhv-6 explore family 
size factors associated poverty, whereas breast-feeding 
examined protective factor hhv-7 infection.
