chronic viral hepatitis depends inability t-cell immune response to
eradicate antigen. results sustained immune response accompanied by
tissue injury fibrogenesis. created mouse model reproduces
these effects, based response cd8(+) cells hepatocellular antigen 
delivered adeno-associated virus (aav) vector. ten thousand
antigen-specific cd8(+) cells undergo slow expansion liver can
precipitate subacute inflammatory hepatitis stellate cell activation and
fibrosis. time, antigen-specific cd8(+) cells show signs exhaustion,
including high expression pd-1, eventually inflammation fibrosis 
resolve. model allows investigation chronic liver
immunopathology resolution.
