the aim study develop lightcycler-based real-time pcr assay 
monitoring epstein-barr virus (ebv) dna load unfractionated whole blood.
this assay compared quantitative competitive pcr (q-pcr) ebv. the
lightcycler-based assay highly sensitive reproducible quantifying
plasmid dna either presence absence healthy donor blood dna.
amplifying plasmid dna dna backgrounds different donors slightly
increased variation quantification, indicating clinical specimen dna 
has influence quantification. transplant recipients, good
correlation observed ebv dna load dynamics determined lightcycler 
and q-pcr follow-up samples, although correlation absolute values 
of ebv dna loads weak occasional samples false negative the
lightcycler assay. 253 cross-sectional blood samples patients with
burkitt's lymphoma, infectious mononucleosis, human immunodeficiency virus
infection, weak significant correlation two methods found
(r(2) = 0.37, p < 0.001). results indicate clinical specimen dna
background may influence absolute values ebv dna load lightcycler
analyses effect rare. lightcycler pcr well suited for
monitoring ebv dna load dynamics, diagnostic value comparable to
that q-pcr. avoid false negativity underestimation viral load, future
internal calibration lightcycler recommended. would also enhance
ebv load assay standardization interinstitute comparisons.
