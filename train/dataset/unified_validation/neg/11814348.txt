bizelesin first anticancer drug capable damaging specific regions of
the genome clusters binding sites t(a/t)(4)a. study
characterized sequence- region-specificity bizelesin analogue,
u-78779, designed interact mixed a/t-g/c motifs. nucleotide level,
u-78779 found prefer runs a/ts interspersed 1 2 g/c pairs,
although 25% identified sites corresponded pure motifs similar to
bizelesin sites. silico computational analysis showed preferred
mixed a/t-g/c motifs distribute uniformly genomic level. contrast, 
secondary, pure motifs (a/t)(6)a found densely clustered long
islands at-rich dna bizelesin targets. mapping sites quantitating
the frequencies u-78779 adducts model island non-at island naked
dnas demonstrated clusters pure motifs outcompete isolated mixed
a/t-g/c sites attracting drug binding. regional preference u-78779 at
island domains verified also dna drug-treated cells. thus, 
primary sequence preference gives rise non-region-specific scattered lesions, 
the clustering minor pure binding motifs seems determine
region-specificity u-78779 human genome. closely correlated
cytotoxic activities u-78779 bizelesin several cell lines imply
that drugs may share common cellular targets. study underscores the
significance genome factor drug's potential region-specific dna
damage, showing take precedence drug binding preferences at
the nucleotide level.
