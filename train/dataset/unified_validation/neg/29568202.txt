aim: describe characteristics people diagnosed acute chronic
hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection british columbia (bc).
methods: used data bc hepatitis testers cohort (bc-htc), which
includes individuals tested hepatitis c virus (hcv) human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) diagnosed hbv active tuberculosis
in bc since 1990. data integrated prescription drug, medical
visit, hospitalization mortality data. hbv cases classified acute 
chronic according provincial guidelines. compared characteristics of
individuals hbv infection group (acute, chronic negative). factors
associated acute chronic hbv infection assessed multinomial
logistic regression models comparison hbv negative group.
results: 46498 1058056 eligible bc-htc participants diagnosed with
hbv infection. 4.3% hbv positive individuals diagnosed acute hbv
infections 95.7% chronic infections. problematic alcohol use, injection
drug use, hiv hcv co-infection common among individuals
diagnosed acute hbv compared chronic infections hbv
negative individuals. multivariable multinomial logistic regression models, we
observed significant associations acute chronic hbv diagnosis and
being male, age hbv diagnosis birth cohort, south east asian ethnicity,
hcv hiv infection, injection drug use. odds acute hbv decreased
with increasing age among people inject drugs, opposite true
for chronic hbv. persons acute hbv predominantly white (78%) while
those chronic hbv mostly east asian (60%). relative whites, east
asians 12 times greater odds diagnosed chronic hbv infection.
these odds increased increasing socioeconomic deprivation.
conclusion: differences profiles people diagnosed acute and
chronic hbv infection necessitate differentiated screening, prevention, care 
treatment programs.
