the scf complexes prototype superfamily cullin-dependent
ubiquitin ligases, regulate diverse cellular functions promoting the
ubiquitination large number regulatory signaling proteins. scf
complexes organized elongated scaffold protein subunit cul1, which
interacts rbx1 ring finger protein one end skp1 adaptor
protein other. binding skp1, members f-box protein family are
responsible recruiting specific substrates ligase machine. this
chapter describes methods developed achieve high-level expression
and purification two recombinant scf complexes insect cells and
bacteria. emphasize power protein coexpression novel
"split-n-coexpress" method producing soluble functional recombinant
proteins protein complexes. propose similar approaches used to
obtain large quantities scf scf-like complexes biochemical and
structural investigations.
