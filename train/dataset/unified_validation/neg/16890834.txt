background: lopinavir-ritonavir preferred protease inhibitor co-formulation 
for initial hiv-1 treatment. fosamprenavir-ritonavir shown similar efficacy
and safety lopinavir-ritonavir combined two nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors. compared two treatments directly in
antiretroviral-naive patients.
methods: open-label, non-inferiority study included 878
antiretroviral-naive, hiv-1-infected patients randomised receive either
fosamprenavir-ritonavir 700 mg/100 mg twice daily lopinavir-ritonavir 400
mg/100 mg twice daily, co-formulation abacavir-lamivudine 600
mg/300 mg daily. primary endpoints proportion patients achieving
hiv-1 rna less 400 copies per ml week 48 treatment discontinuations
because adverse event. intent-to-treat analysis included patients
exposed least one dose randomised study medication. study is
registered clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00085943.
findings: week 48, non-inferiority fosamprenavir-ritonavir to
lopinavir-ritonavir (95% ci around treatment difference -4.84 7.05) was
shown, 315 434 (73%) patients fosamprenavir-ritonavir group and
317 444 (71%) lopinavir-ritonavir group achieving hiv-1 rna less than
400 copies per ml. treatment discontinuations due adverse event few
and occurred similar frequency two treatment groups
(fosamprenavir-ritonavir 53, 12%; lopinavir-ritonavir 43, 10%). diarrhoea,
nausea, abacavir hypersensitivity frequent drug-related grade
2-4 adverse events. treatment-emergent drug resistance rare; patient had
virus developed reduced susceptibility fosamprenavir-ritonavir or
lopinavir-ritonavir.
interpretation: fosamprenavir-ritonavir twice daily treatment-naive patients
provides similar antiviral efficacy, safety, tolerability, emergence of
resistance lopinavir-ritonavir, combination abacavir-lamivudine.
