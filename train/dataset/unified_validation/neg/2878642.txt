there increased amount evidence suggest viruses play important
roles development certain types human tumors. include the
hepatitis b virus hepatocellular carcinoma, human papillomaviruses cervical
cancer, epstein-barr virus burkitt's lymphoma nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
and human t-lymphotrophic virus adult cell leukemia hairy cell leukemia.
these pieces evidence accumulated clinical basic studies
which shown viruses involved stage the
carcinogenic process. rapid development techniques and
knowledge molecular biology, gene structures viruses 
their products identified. results make possible understand
more clearly route infection facilitated production of
vaccines, using dna-recombinant techniques. significant decrease the
incidence types cancers expected prevention programs
conducted throughout general population viruses within 10 20
years. virus-related human cancers also provide us good opportunity 
to understand basic mechanisms involved development human cancers
in general. present paper, points stressed addition to
describing recent progress made study virus-related human cancers.
