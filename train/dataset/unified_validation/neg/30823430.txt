bacteriophages pervasive viruses infect bacteria, relying their
genetic machinery replicate. order protect kind 
invader, bacteria developed ingenious adaptive defence system, clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr). researchers soon
realised specific type crispr system, crispr-cas9, could modified
into simple efficient genetic engineering technology, several
improvements currently used systems. discovery set motion a
revolution genetics, new improved crispr systems used plenty
of vitro vivo experiments recent years. review illustrates 
mechanisms behind crispr-cas systems means bacterial immunity against
phage invasion systems engineered originate new genetic
manipulation tools. newfound crispr-cas technologies up-and-coming
applications systems healthcare fields science also 
discussed.
