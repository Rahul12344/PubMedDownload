the olfactory bulb, neocortex archicortex arise common pool of
progenitors dorsal telencephalon. studied consequences supplying
excess notch1 signal vivo cellular regional destinies of
telencephalic precursors using bicistronic replication defective retroviruses.
after ventricular injections mid-neurogenesis (e14.5), activated notch1
retrovirus markedly inhibited generation neurons telencephalic
precursors, delayed emergence cells subventricular zone (svz),
and produced augmentation glial progeny neo- archicortex.
however, activated notch1 distinct effect progenitors the
olfactory bulb, markedly reducing numbers cells type migrated 
there. elucidate mechanism cell fate changes elicited notch1
signals cortical regions, short- long-term cultures e14.5
telencephalic progenitors examined. studies reveal activated
notch1 elicits cessation proliferation coincides inhibition 
the generation neurons. later, gliogenesis, activated notch1 triggers a
rapid cellular proliferation significant increase generation of
cells expressing gfap. examine generation cells destined the
olfactory bulb, used stereotaxic injections early postnatal anterior 
subventricular zone (svza). observed precursors olfactory bulb
responded notch signals remaining quiescent failing give rise to
differentiated progeny type, unlike cortical precursor cells, which
generated glia instead neurons. data show forebrain precursors vary
in response notch signals according spatial temporal cues, and
that notch signals influence composition forebrain regions modulating
the rate proliferation neural precursor cells.
