adenovirus virus-associated (va) rnai maintains efficient protein synthesis
during late phase infection preventing activation the
double-stranded-rna-dependent protein kinase, dai. secondary structure model
for va rnai predicts existence two stems joined complex stem-loop
structure, central domain. structural consequences mutations and
compensating mutations introduced apical stem lend support this
model. transient expression assays va rna function, foreign sequences
inserted apical stem fully tolerated provided stem
remained intact. mutants base apical stem disrupted
retained partial activity, truncation apical stem abolished the
ability rna block dai activation vitro, suggesting length
and position stem important va rna function. results
imply va rnai activity depends secondary structure top the
apical stem well central domain consistent two-step
mechanism involving dai interactions apical stem central
domain.
