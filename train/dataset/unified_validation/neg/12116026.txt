neonatal herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection severe disease high
mortality morbidity spite development effective anti-viral
therapies. viral load neonatal herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection was
measured retrospectively 37 patients. hsv dna copy numbers serum and
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) quantified using real-time pcr assay. patients
with disseminated infection higher viral load sera. whereas
patients central nervous system (cns) infection exhibited higher viral
load csf. viral load significantly higher serum patients
who died later. interestingly, patients hsv type-2 infection exhibited 
cns involvement neurological impairment, together high viral load in
the csf, hsv type-1 patients. results suggest quantitation of
hsv viral load may useful assessing prognosis, may provide
additional information management neonatal hsv infection.
