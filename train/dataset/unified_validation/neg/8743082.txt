tat, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-encoded transcription factor, is
vital hiv replication transcription. drug inhibits tat's
activity valuable candidate chemotherapeutic applications. show 
that doxorubicin (dox), well-known anticancer drug derivative,
daunomycin, inhibit ability tat activate hiv-1 ltr. we
contransfected hela cells psv40tat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
gene driven hiv ltr promoter. cat transcription vigorously stimulated
many fold tat production effect tat inhibited dox a
dose-dependent manner. transcriptional activation domain tat, located in
its 67 amino terminal residues, remains dox sensitive. tar-deleted reporter
gene gal binding domain transactivated gal-tat fusion protein.
this transcription complex retains high level activity presence of
dox, suggesting dox primarily affects rna-tat, rather dna-tat, mediated
transactivation. rna gel mobility analysis reveals dox affect the
binding tat tar-rna vitro increase binding activity of
cellular nuclear proteins tar-rna. induction activation such
tar-binding proteins cells might interfere activity tat could
explain observed inhibitory effects dox tat-activated transcription.
these results suggest dox may chemotherapeutic effects hiv
expression mediated tar rna.
