vesicular stomatitis virus g glycoprotein (vsv-g)-pseudotyped
replication-defective retroviral particles pantropic amenable to
concentration high titer ultracentrifugation. features allowed
development effective retroviral transduction protocols stem cells in
vitro well tissue engineering vivo. however, retroparticle
ultracentrifugation protocols also copellet cellular subcellular debris 
released retroviral producer cell lines vector manufacture. have
analyzed concentrated vector preparations chromatography found a
significant amount genomic dna released producer cells coconcentrates
with retroviral particles. effort generate high-purity retroparticle
preparations, devoid subcellular contaminants contaminating genomic dna,
we developed process using size-exclusion chromatography combined with
host cell nucleic acid digestion concentration ultrafiltration. the
procedure allowed final recovery 19 +/- 0.4% infectious viral particles 
from unfractionated starting material, average retroparticle
concentration 7.7 x 10(7) +/- 1.5 x 10(6)/ml. intact virus high
purity, >90% determined anion-exchange high-performance liquid
chromatography. retroparticle structure appeared intact determined negative
stain electron microscopy purified virus functional allowed for
efficient transduction primary human bone marrow stromal cells vitro. in
conclusion, developed vsv-g retrovector purification process can
be applied large-scale retroviral production ideal cell gene therapy
applications.
