infectious complications one important causes morbi-mortality 
in oncology patients. neutropenia important risk factor for
developing infection oncology patient. although highest mortalities
continue associated infections due enterobacterias pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, frequency infections due gram-positives higher. deep
fungic infections, like produced resistant infrequent bacteria
usually occur late periods protracted neutropenias. recent years
different studies shown efficiency antibiotic patterns monotherapy
in treatment neutropenic patient fever. cellular
immunosuppression usually relevant neutropenia oncology patients 
without complications. however, use high doses steroids some
patients use purine analogues monoclonal antibodies 
changed situation recent years. patients recommendable
to use prophylactic measures directed cytomegalovirus, varicela-zoster
virus, p.carinii (or jirovecii) fungic infections. bacteraemia associated
with endovascular catheterisation principal cause bacteraemia 
patients, due gram-positive micro-organisms. case infection,
it always advisable remove catheter. however, certain
circumstances, placing new catheter might risky given the
patient's characteristics agents low virulence (e.g.
coagulase-negative staphylococcus), conservative treatment tried. a
persistence fever bacteraemia following removal catheter lead
to suspicion presence deep infection, fundamentally suppurated
thrombophlebitis endocarditis. adequate understanding infectious
complications patients correct treatment prevention are
decisive reducing high mortality associated clinical
manifestations.
