background: immunization mice g protein respiratory syncytial
virus (rsv) characteristically induces immune response partially
protective, prime pulmonary eosinophilia. shown
previously n191a mutation recombinant rsv g protein fragment is
associated reduced pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration administered
with alum subcutaneously balb/c mice followed rsv challenge. hypothesize
that performance "epitope enhanced" recombinant g protein fragment
may improved combining newly developed adjuvant,
protollin, coupled intranasal delivery.
objectives: investigate efficacy intranasally delivered,
protollin-adjuvanted, epitope-enhanced recombinant g protein vaccine balb/c
mice.
study design: recombinant protein, designated trx-g128-229, consisted a
bacterially expressed central fragment (amino acids 128-229) rsv long
strain g protein fused fragment thioredoxin (trx). balb/c mice were
chosen evaluate effectiveness wild type epitope-enhanced
trx-g128-229 nasal vaccine adjuvant protollin.
results: intranasal administration trx-g128-229 protollin conferred
similar protection rsv challenge subcutaneously administered
trx-g128-229 alum, markedly reduced eosinophilia th2
cytokine il-13.
conclusions: results support concept rsv vaccine optimized by
combined strategies, including epitope enhancement judicious selection of
adjuvants.
