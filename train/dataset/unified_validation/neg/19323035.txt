we determined differential expression levels proteins peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells patients dengue fever (df) dengue hemorrhagic fever
(dhf). proteins subjected two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass
spectrometry western blot analysis. identified 8 proteins 2-fold
or up-regulated patients compared healthy control, three which,
aldolase, thioredoxin peroxidase alpha tubulin, related dengue
infection. thioredoxin peroxidase alpha tubulin over-expressed 4.9 
and 3.3 times respectively dhf compared df patients aldolase was
up-regulated 2.2 times df compared dhf patients. alpha tubulin and
thioredoxin peroxidase potential utilized biomarkers dhf.
