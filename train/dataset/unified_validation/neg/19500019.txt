humans tailor virus-specific immune responses modulated expression 12 
different interferon (ifn)-alpha subtypes. however, exacerbated expression of
certain ifn-alpha subtypes causes immunopathology context autoimmune
conditions chronic viral infections. showed progression aids is
associated elevated expression ifn-alpha unstimulated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. here, sought determine whether distinct ifn-alpha
subtypes involved phenomenon. used quantitative rt-pcr assess
expression levels 12 ifn-alpha subtypes peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
from normal donors hiv-1 patients cdc stage stage c disease. 
three patterns ifn-alpha subtype expression emerged. first, ifn-alpha2 and
ifn-alpha6 mrna levels elevated patient groups. second,
ifn-alpha1/13, ifn-alpha8, ifn-alpha14, ifn-alpha16, ifn-alpha17, ifn-alpha21
were upregulated stage c stage patients. third, expression levels of
ifn-alpha4, ifn-alpha5, ifn-alpha7, ifn-alpha10 change among the
three groups volunteers. among subtypes, ifn-alpha2 was
preferentially upregulated, showing >60-fold higher levels stage and
>400-fold stage c patients compared controls, correlated with
declining cd4 counts. results demonstrate distinct ifn-alpha subtypes
are sequentially activated hiv-1 infection, may predictive of
disease progression.
