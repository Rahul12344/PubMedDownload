pd 404,182 (pd) synthetic compound found compromise hiv
integrity via interaction nonenvelope protein viral structural component
(a. m. chamoun et al., antimicrob. agents chemother. 56:672-681, 2012). the
present study evaluates potential pd anti-hiv microbicide and
establishes pd's virucidal activity toward another pathogen, herpes simplex virus
(hsv). show anti-hiv-1 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) pd,
when diluted seminal plasma, ∼1 μm, similar ic50 determined cell 
culture growth medium, pd retains full anti-hiv-1 activity after
incubation cervical fluid 37°c least 24 h. addition, pd is
nontoxic toward vaginal commensal lactobacillus species (50% cytotoxic
concentration [cc50], >300 μm), freshly activated human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (cc50, ∼200 μm), primary cd4(+) cells, macrophages, and
dendritic cells (cc50, >300 μm). pd also exhibited high stability ph-adjusted 
dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline little activity loss 8
weeks ph 4 42°c, indicating suitability formulation transportation
and storage developing countries. finally, first time, show pd
inactivates herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) hsv-2 submicromolar
concentrations. due prevalence hsv infection, ability pd to
inactivate hsv may provide additional incentive use microbicide. 
ability pd inactivate hiv-1 hsv, combined low toxicity
and high stability, warrants additional studies evaluation pd's
microbicidal candidacy animals humans.
