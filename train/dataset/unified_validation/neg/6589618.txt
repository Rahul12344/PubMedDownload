by nuclear extracts.

precursor mrnas synthesized vitro plasmid early
region 2 gene adenovirus 2 fused efficient bacteriophage promoter
(salmonella phage 6). rnas purified used substrates vitro 
splicing presence nuclear extracts prepared mopc-315 mouse myeloma
cells. vitro splicing accurate nucleotide level. reaction
occurs rapidly without detectable lag. concentration pre-mrna 
precursor incubation appears important factor high efficiency
(60%-80%) vitro rna splicing. fractionation splicing components as
