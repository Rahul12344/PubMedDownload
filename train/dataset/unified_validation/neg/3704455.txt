aids: problem adequately assessed?

de gruttola v, mayer k, bennett w.

epidemiologic inferences epidemic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(aids) developed three different sources: case-control studies, cohort
studies, national data prevalence incidence. together data imply
that reducing number sexual partners may provide little
protection. shifting "lower-risk" behavior helpful the
cumulative risk transmitting virus reduced nearly zero. however,
if members minimally affected population made shift, benefit 
to population could dramatic. emerging realization latency
periods longer first thought implies epidemic could much
more severe anticipated. regional trends give assurance 
has reached peak, even areas highest prevalence. much work needs 
be done establish actual role saliva transmitting htlv-iii because
oral contagion greatest potential spread disease. efforts to
determine latency period crucial predicting future the
epidemic. preventive measures--behavior modification education--hold some
hope retarding spread epidemic pending development effective therapy
or vaccine.
