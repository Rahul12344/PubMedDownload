the post-translational glycosylation select proteins o-linked mannose
(o-mannose o-man) conserved modification yeast humans has
been shown necessary proper development growth. well
studied o-mannosylated mammalian protein α-dystroglycan (α-dg).
hypoglycosylation α-dg results varying severities congenital muscular
dystrophies, cancer progression metastasis, inhibited entry infection
of certain arenaviruses. defects gene products responsible for
post-translational modification α-dg, primarily glycosyltransferases, 
basis diseases. multitude clinical phenotypes resulting from
defective o-mannosylation highlights biomedical significance unique
modification. elucidation various o-mannose biosynthetic pathways is
imperative understanding broad range human diseases the
development novel therapeutics. review, focus recent
discoveries delineating various enzymes, structures functions associated 
with o-mannose-initiated glycoproteins. additionally, discuss current gaps 
our knowledge mammalian o-mannosylation, discuss evolution this
pathway, illustrate utility limitations model systems study
functions o-mannosylation.
