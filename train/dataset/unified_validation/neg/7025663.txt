morphogenesis yellow fever virus aedes aegypti cultured cells. i. isolation
of different cellular clones study susceptibility infection
with virus.

deubel v, digoutte jp.

we report isolation 19 cellular clones aedes aegypti analyze 
susceptibility infection yellow fever virus, comparison the
uncloned cells. four types clones found, different morphology,
their metabolism virus production. c 17 clone produces most
virus, respect aedes aegypti clones, also other
uncloned arthropod cells published literature. cytopathic effect exists 
in virus infected cells. cloned uncloned cells seem produce any
antiviral substance transfers cells immunity virus.
an immunological study immunoperoxidase enabled us follow appearance 
of viral antigens locate cell. beginning observed 
perinuclear coloration diffusing whole cytoplasm. present
report represents introduction structural study morphogenesis of
yellow fever virus within cells aedes aegypti.
