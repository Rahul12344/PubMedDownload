the human phase 2b rv144 alvac-hiv vcp1521/aidsvax b/e vaccine trial, held in
thailand, resulted estimated 31.2% efficacy hiv infection. by
contrast, vaccination vax003 (consisting aidsvax b/e) not
protective. protection within rv144 observed absence of
neutralizing antibody activity cytotoxic cell responses, speculated 
the specificity qualitative differences fc-effector profiles of
nonneutralizing antibodies may accounted efficacy differences
observed two trials. show rv144 regimen elicited
nonneutralizing antibodies highly coordinated fc-mediated effector responses
through selective induction highly functional immunoglobulin g3 (igg3). by
contrast, vax003 elicited monofunctional antibody responses influenced igg4
selection, promoted repeated aidsvax b/e protein boosts. moreover,
only rv144 induced igg1 igg3 antibodies targeting crown hiv
envelope v2 loop, albeit limited coverage breakthrough viral sequences.
these data suggest subclass selection differences associated with
coordinated humoral functional responses targeting strain-specific protective v2 
loop epitopes may underlie differences vaccine efficacy observed these
two vaccine trials.
