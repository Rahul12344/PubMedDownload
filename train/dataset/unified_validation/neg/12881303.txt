retroviral vectors commonly used clinical gene therapy, recent
observations insertional oncogene activation preclinical clinical
settings forced discussion safety. investigated the
relationship retroviral transduction efficiency mass cultures 
actual number integrated vector copies single cells using k562 leukemia and
primary cd34+ cells. found exponential increase integration numbers
correlated gene transfer rates linear increase expression levels with
insertion frequency. average detected one vector insertion per transduced
cell gene transfer less 30%, 3 60%, approximately 9 90%
(in k562). clonal analysis revealed strikingly increased variations both
transgene copy numbers (more 20-fold primary cells) expression levels
associated higher transduction. therefore, limiting retroviral gene transfer
to approximately 30% may suggested avoid generating clones containing
multiple insertions.
