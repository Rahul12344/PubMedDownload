the hypothesis offered many different illnesses could treated 
slowing synthesis glucosphingolipids (gsls) suitable inhibitor. 
people inadequate hydrolases gsls (e.g. gaucher's disease), the
lipids accumulate pathological degree. possible eliminate
the accumulation slowing synthesis gsls match ability the
patient degrade them. people cancer, tumors secrete excessive
amounts gsls, block ability immune system attack tumor
cells. blocking synthesis tumor gsls, possible enable
the patient generate antibodies activated cells destroy the
tumor. tumors exhibiting multidrug resistance may synthesizing gsls even
faster usual. possible restore sensitivity tumor 
to anti-cancer drugs inhibiting synthesis gsls. metastasis tumors 
also appears require formation gsls, inhibitor help block 
tumor dissemination. diabetics tend high levels blood glucose, which
acts stimulate kidney growth via rapid synthesis gsls. this
pathological growth blocked inhibiting formation kidney gsls.
viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxins found bind specific gsls 
of human animal cells. presumably, binding leads damaging process
of infection. possible treat infections depleting the
host's body gsls.
