deleobuvir (bi 207127) investigational oral nonnucleoside inhibitor of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns5b rna polymerase. antiviral activity, virology,
pharmacokinetics, safety assessed hcv genotype 1-infected patients
receiving 5 days' deleobuvir monotherapy. double-blind phase 1b study,
treatment-naive (tn; n = 15) treatment-experienced (te; n = 45) patients
without cirrhosis received placebo deleobuvir 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,200 
mg every 8 h (q8h) 5 days. patients cirrhosis (n = 13) received
deleobuvir 400 600 mg q8h 5 days. virologic analyses included ns5b
genotyping phenotyping individual isolates. day 5, patients without
cirrhosis dose-dependent median hcv rna reductions 3.8 log10 (with
no placebo response); patients cirrhosis median hcv rna reductions of
approximately 3.0 log10. three patients discontinued due adverse events (aes).
the common aes gastrointestinal, nervous system, skin/cutaneous
tissue disorders. plasma exposure deleobuvir supraproportional doses ≥ 
400 mg q8h approximately 2-fold higher patients cirrhosis in
patients without cirrhosis. virologic breakthrough observed. ns5b
substitutions associated deleobuvir resistance vitro detected in
9/59 patients; seven encoded p495 substitutions, including p495l, conferred
120- 310-fold-decreased sensitivity deleobuvir. p495 variants not
persist follow-up without selective drug pressure. deleobuvir monotherapy 
generally well tolerated demonstrated dose-dependent antiviral activity
against hcv genotype 1 5 days.
