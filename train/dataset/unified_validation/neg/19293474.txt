background: herpes simplex virus type 1 one common viruses among
human population. studies demonstrate essential role cell mediated
immunity, especially cd8+ cells, prevention clearance hsv1.
objective: great importance improve knowledge kinetics 
of ctl responses primary secondary hsv-1 infection.
methods: using sensitive technique detection analysis cd8+ cells, 
granzyme b elisa, ctl activity spleens balb/c mice various time 
points intraperitoneal administration hsv1 (strain kos) primary and
secondary infections determined.
results: acute hsv-1 infection, virus specific cytotoxic cells were
detected day 5 post virus inoculation peaked day 7. six hours after
secondary infection activity memory cd8+ cells detected peaked
at 12 hours post infection.
conclusion: peak ctl activity found day 7 post infection in
primary hsv-1 infections decreased time. secondary infections, 
activity ctls reached highest level 12 hours post infection.
