to investigate whether killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (kir) human
leukocyte antigen (hla) genetic background could influence onset age of
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) patients hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection, one hundred seventy-one males hbv-related hcc enrolled. 
the presence 12 loci kir detected individually. hla-a, -b, -c loci 
were genotyped high resolution routine sequence-based typing method.
the effect kir locus, hla ligand, hla-kir combination examined
individually kaplan-meier (km) analysis. multivariate cox hazard regression
model also applied. identified c1c1-kir2ds2/2dl2 independent risk
factor earlier onset age hcc (median onset age 44 for
c1c1-kir2ds2/2dl2 positive patients compared 50 negative patients, p =
0.04 km analysis; hr = 1.70, p = 0.004 multivariate cox model). we
conclude kir hla genetic background influence onset age hcc
in male patients hbv infection. study may useful improve the
current hcc surveillance program hbv-infected patients. findings also
suggest important role natural killer cells (or kir-expressing cells)
in progress hbv-related hcc development.
