to determine whether systemic immunization plasmid dna virus vector
against visna/maedi virus (vmv) would induce protective immune responses, sheep
were immunized vmv gag and/or env sequences using particle-mediated
epidermal bombardment injection recombinant modified vaccinia ankara. 
results showed immunization induced humoral cell-mediated responses
prior virus challenge. vaccination protocol prevent
infection, immunization gag gene combination gag env
genes resulted significantly reduced provirus loads blood mediastinal
lymph node, respectively. provirus loads lung draining lymph node were
unaffected, p25 expression undetectable lungs animals immunized
with combination gag env genes. analysis target tissues lesions
at post-mortem showed immunization env gene caused significant
increase lesion score, gag gene combination gag env
genes effect. inclusion ovine interferon-gamma gene initial 
priming mixture minimal effect immune responses, provirus load, lesion 
development, although resulted decreased p25 expression lung. 
results thus show systemic immunization gag combination gag and
env genes reduces provirus load blood lymphoid tissue, respectively
whereas env immunization effect provirus load increased lesion
development.
