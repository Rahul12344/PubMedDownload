background: mass vaccination implemented prevent spread 2009
pandemic influenza virus china. highly limited information available on
whether vaccine induces cross-reactive neutralization antibodies against
other subtypes influenza viruses.
methods: employed pseudovirus-based assays analyze heterosubtypic
neutralization responses serum samples 23 recipients 2009 pandemic
influenza vaccine.
results: one dose pandemic vaccine stimulated good neutralization
antibodies cognate influenza virus 2009 influenza (h1n1), also
raised broad cross-reactive neutralization activities seasonal h3n2 and
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 lesser h2n2. the
cross-reactive neutralization activities completely abolished the
removal immunoglobin g (igg). contrast, h1n1 vaccination alone in
influenza-naive mice elicited vigorous homologous neutralizing activities
but cross-reactive neutralization activities.
conclusions: data suggest cross-reactive neutralization epitopes 
exist vaccine could elicit significant cross-reactive neutralizing
igg antibodies presence preexisting responses. exposure h1n1
vaccine likely modify hierarchical order preexisting immune
responses influenza viruses. findings provide insights the
evolution human immunity influenza viruses experiencing multiple
influenza virus infections vaccinations.
