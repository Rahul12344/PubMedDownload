background: viral warts caused human papilloma virus represent one 
most common diseases skin. area skin affected although the
hands feet far commonest sites. wide range local
treatments available.
objectives: assess effects different local treatments cutaneous,
non-genital warts healthy people.
search strategy: searched cochrane controlled trials register (january
2003), skin group trials register (january 2003), medline (1966 january
2003), embase (1980 january 2003) number key biomedical and
health economics databases. addition cited references trials
identified key review articles searched. pharmaceutical companies
involved local treatments warts experts field contacted.
the recent searches carried
selection criteria: randomised controlled trials local treatments for
cutaneous non-genital viral warts immunocompetent human hosts included.
data collection analysis: study selection assessment methodological
quality carried two independent reviewers.
main results: fifty two trials identified fulfilled criteria for
inclusion review. evidence provided studies generally
weak poor methodology reporting. 17 trials placebo groups 
that used participants unit analysis average cure rate placebo
preparations 30% (range 0 73%) average period 10 weeks (range 
4 24 weeks). best available evidence simple topical treatments
containing salicylic acid, clearly better placebo. data pooled
from six placebo-controlled trials show cure rate 144/191 (75%) compared
with 89/185 (48%) controls, odds ratio 3.91 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to
6.36), random effects model. bigger trials cryotherapy studied
different regimens rather comparing cryotherapy treatments or
placebo. pooled data two small trials included cryotherapy placebo 
or treatment, showed significant difference cure rates. two trials
comparing cryotherapy salicylic acid one comparing duct tape with
cryotherapy significant difference efficacy demonstrated. 
consistent evidence effectiveness intralesional bleomycin. four
studies, using warts rather individuals unit analysis, widely 
varying results could meaningfully pooled. evidence
for efficacy dinitrochlorobenzene, potent contact sensitizer. pooled
data two small studies comparing dinitrochlorobenzene placebo showed
cure rates 32/40 (80%) 15/40 (38%) respectively, odds ratio 6.67 (95%
confidence interval 2.44 18.23), random effects model. limited evidence
was found efficacy topical 5-fluorouracil, intralesional interferons
and photodynamic therapy.bleomycin, dinitrochlorobenzene, 5-fluorouracil,
interferons photodynamic therapy potentially hazardous toxic
treatments.
reviewer's conclusions: considerable lack evidence base
the rational use local treatments common warts. reviewed trials
are highly variable method quality. cure rates placebo preparations
are variable nevertheless considerable. certainly evidence that
simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid therapeutic effect.
there less evidence efficacy cryotherapy evidence 
is equivalent efficacy simpler, safer treatments. dinitrochlorobenzene
appears effective statistically significant differences
when compared safer, simpler cheaper topical treatments containing
salicylic acid. benefits risks 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, interferons 
and photodynamic therapy remain determined.
