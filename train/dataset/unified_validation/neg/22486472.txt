japanese encephalitis virus (jev) causes diseases attack human central
nervous system. traditionally, quality control jev vaccines, the
plaque reduction neutralization (prn) titer measured national control
laboratories vaccine batches marketed, required laboratory
animal testing. however, classical animal tests inherent problems, including
the fact animals used, ethical issues, possibility of
error. study, jev antigen measured vitro assay assess the
feasibility replacing vivo assays measure prn titers jev
vaccines. constructed double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ds-elisa) could detect jev envelope (e). initially, monoclonal antibodies
(mabs) directed jev e protein generated characterized. we
isolated 18 mabs jev e protein, igg1 igg2a isotype. 
the mabs (5f15 7d71) selected suitable mab pair detect
jev e protein. ds-elisa pair detected little approximately 3
μg/ml jev e protein demonstrated relationship amount jev e
protein prn titer. results, surmise ds-elisa may 
be useful, terms measuring amount jev e protein, also
as substitute prn test jev vaccine evaluation.
