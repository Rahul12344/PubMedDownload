chromogranin cellular marker forneuroendocrine tumors. elevated levels 
chromogranin also found patients cancers epithelial origin 
neuroendocrine differentiation occurs, associated poor prognosis.
we investigated prevalence serum levels chromogranin patients with
primary liver cancer. seventy-nine patients (65 males, mean age 67.6 years, range
48-88 years) liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma studied. 
etiology cirrhosis identified due hepatitis c virus infection 47 
patients, hepatitis c virus alcohol 7, alcohol alone 14, to
hepatitis c b virus 2, hepatitis b virus alone 4. the
remaining patients, 2 suffered hemochromatosis 3 cryptogenic
cirrhosis. according child-pugh's score, 54 patients belonged class a, 
22 class b, 3 class c. concentration chromogranin measured
in serum commercial solid-phase two-site immunoradiometric assay. elevated
serum levels chromogranin found 32 79 patients (43%). levels over
600 ng/ml present 7 76 patients (9.2%), high
serum levels alpha-fetoprotein. hence, elevated serum levels chromogranin a
are present one third patients hepatocellular carcinoma. is
therefore possible hepatocellular carcinomas could acquire a
neuroendocrine differentiation. propose studies ascertain whether
serum levels chromogranin useful prognostic marker for
hepatocellular carcinoma prostate cancer.
