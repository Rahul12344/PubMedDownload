human endogenous retrovirus w family (herv-w) envelope (env) reported to
be related several human diseases, including autoimmune disorders, it
could activate innate immunity. however, reports investigating
whether human leukemia antigen (hla)-a*0201+ restriction involved the
immune response caused herv-w env neuropsychiatric diseases. present
study, herv-w env-derived epitopes presented hla-a*0201 described the
potential use adoptive immunotherapy. five peptides displaying
hla-a*0201-binding motifs predicted using syfepithi bimas, and
synthesized. cck-8 assay showed peptides w, q promoted lymphocyte
proliferation. stimulation peripheral blood mononuclear cells hla-a*0201+
donors peptides induced peptide-specific cd8+ cells. high
numbers ifn-Î³-secreting cells also detectable several weekly
stimulations w, q t. besides lysis herv-w env-loaded target cells,
specific apoptosis also observed. data demonstrate human cells
can sensitized toward herv-w env peptides (w, q t) and, moreover, pose a
high killing potential toward herv-w env-expressing u251 cells. conclusion,
peptides w q t, herv-w env antigenic epitopes, both
antigenicity immunogenicity, cause strong cell immune responses.
our data strengthen view herv-w env considered an
autoantigen induce autoimmunity neuropsychiatric diseases, as
multiple sclerosis schizophrenia. data might provide experimental
foundation herv-w env peptide vaccine new insight treatment of
neuropsychiatric diseases.
