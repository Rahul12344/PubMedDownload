a series new compounds, carbocyclic oxetanocins, synthesized and
their anti-herpesvirus activity determined. carbocyclic oxetanocin g (oxt-g) 
most active herpes simplex virus (hsv) human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)
among carbocyclic oxetanocins tested; median effective concentrations (ec50) 
for hsv-1, -2, hcmv 0.23, 0.04 0.40 micrograms/ml, respectively. the
ec50 value carbocyclic oxt-g hsv-2 significantly lower 
of acyclovir, ganciclovir (dhpg) oxt-g, value hcmv was
comparable dhpg oxt-g. carbocyclic oxt-g showed much higher
activity tk+ hsv-2 tk- mutant, suggesting this
compound good substrate hsv-2-induced tk. antiviral activity 
compound partially reversed even addition 100-fold excess
deoxyguanosine. results suggest mode action carbocyclic oxt-g 
is different oxt-g.
