during 1990s, milan labuda's experimental results established new paradigm 
for study tick-borne viruses since strengthened its
demonstrated effectiveness explaining epidemiology tick-borne
encephalitis (tbe). brief review summarizes essential features the
transmission tick-borne pathogens tbe virus. leukocytes migrate
between tick feeding sites, bearing infective virions providing transport
route virus co-feeding ticks independent systemic viraemia. 
such tick-borne pathogens thus transmitted tick tick via vertebrates;
the ticks reservoirs well vectors, vertebrate 
transient bridge. aim bring related non-synonymous terms
(co-feeding non-systemic) attention workers use simple pcr
screening identify additional vertebrate reservoir hosts vector-borne
pathogens fact maintained nature systemic
transmission.
