between 1982 1985 cadavers 50 guillemots (uria aalge), 41 kittiwakes
(rissa tridactyla), 26 herring gulls (larus argentatus) 34 black-headed gulls
(larus ridibundus) examined pathological, bacteriological virological.
the probable cause death established. parasitosis particularly
prevalent herring gulls (49%), main infection--as black-headed
gulls--was cestoides. kittiwakes guillemots mainly spiruroideae 
recorded. commonest bacterium isolated organs intestinal tract was
escherichia coli, followed aeromonas hydrophila clostridium perfringens.
salmonella found organs 5% intestinal tract 3% of
the birds. species salmonella frequently isolated salmonella
typhimurium varieties copenhagen. also recorded yersinia intermedia serovar 
0:17 (1x), pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria the
haemophilus-pasteurella-actinobacillus group (1x), pasteurella multocida (2x),
moraxella septicaemiae (1x), campylobacter spec. (1x), mycoplasma spec. (6x),
dnase positive staphylococcus spec. (4x) streptococcus spec. (6x). less in
evidence among birds examined fungus diseases aspergillus spec.
(4x) blastomyces spec. (4x). viruses one guillemot found have
an adenovirus another one paramyxovirus. one herring
gulls also isolated paramyxovirus, second one reovirus.
three species isolated get identified. chief cause of
sickness death guillemots oil-contamination. majority the
examined kittiwakes herring gulls victims pathogenic agents. many 
the black-headed gulls died traumata gunshots road traffic etc. 
order establish causes sickness death seabirds ascertain 
the importance various species possible carriers infectious
diseases, systematic series investigation necessary. without it
will possible assess epidemiological relevance wild
birds, domestic poultry humans.
