background/aims: chronic infections human hepatitis b virus result
in liver cirrhosis primary hepatocellular carcinoma. reasons these
long-term effects unclear. aim study generate transgenic
mice expressing hbv x- c/e-gene authentic foreign promoter
control test whether respective gene products cause pathologic
effects lifespan mouse. moreover, temporal the
tissue-specific regulation crucial hbv c/e-gene promoter analyzed.
methods: eight transgenic mouse lines generated. four contained c/e- and
x-gene two contained x-gene authentic promoter control. two
lines expressed x-gene control rat insulin
promoter/enhancer. gene expression tested protein mrna analyses.
during observation period 2 years, mice sacrificed organs
subjected histologic examination. mice expressing x-gene pancreatic
beta cells tested development diabetes.
results: liver, slight histopathologic alterations neoplastic
changes could observed mice expressing x-gene. activity c/e-gene
promoter/enhancer age dependent restricted hepatocytes.
conclusion: evidence obtained long-term expression hbv c/e-
and x-gene products cause neoplasia lifespan mouse.
