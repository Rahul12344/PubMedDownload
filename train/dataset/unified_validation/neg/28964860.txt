human dead box atp-dependent rna helicase ddx3x demonstrated exert
crucial functions carcinogenesis antiviral immune response. however, to
our knowledge, information focused functions fish ddx3x. this
study, cloned characterized ddx3x homolog orange spotted grouper
(epinephelus coioides) (ecddx3x). ecddx3x encoded 733-amino acid protein 
shared 97% 76% identity spiny damselfish (acanthochromis polyacanthus) and
human (homo sapiens), respectively. amino acid alignment analysis showed that
ecddx3x contained conserved dexdc helic c domains. transcription levels
of ecddx3x significantly increased poly i:c transfected cells and
red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (rgnnv) infected cells. under
fluorescence microscopy, green fluorescence observed evenly the
cytoplasm ecddx3x transfected cells. ectopic expression ecddx3x
significantly inhibited replication rgnnv, evidenced decreased
numbers vacuoles evoked rgnnv infection, reduced transcription 
levels rgnnv coat protein (cp) rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) genes. 
in contrast, replication singapore grouper iridovirus (sgiv) grouper
spleen (gs) cells significantly affected ecddx3x overexpression.
further studies showed overexpression ecddx3x in vitro significantly
increased expression levels several interferon associated cytokines or
effectors. moreover, regulatory effect ecddx3x interferon immune
response dependent n terminal region, dexdc helic c
domain. addition, also found overexpression ecddx3x significantly
increased interferon promoter activity, activation interferon
immune response regulated irf3 irf7. together, results
firstly showed fish ddx3x exerted crucial roles antiviral immunity
against rna virus infection via upregulating interferon antiviral responses.
