background: authors previously reported genomic subtypes chronic
fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (cfs/me) based expression 88
human genes.
aim: attempt reproduce findings, determine specificity this
signature cfs/me, test associations cfs/me subtype and
infection.
methods: expression levels 88 human genes determined blood 62 new
patients idiopathic cfs/me (according fukuda criteria), six patients with
q-fever-associated cfs/me birmingham q-fever outbreak (according to
fukuda criteria), 14 patients endogenous depression (according dsm-iv
criteria) 29 normal blood donors.
results: patients cfs/me, differential expression confirmed all
88 genes. q-cfs/me similar patterns gene expression idiopathic cfs/me. 
gene expression patients endogenous depression similar the
normal controls, except upregulation five genes (app, crebbp, gnas, pdcd2 
and pdcd6). clustering combined gene data cfs/me patients 
authors' previous study (117 cfs/me patients) revealed genomic subtypes with
distinct differences sf36 scores, clinical phenotypes, severity and
geographical distribution. antibody testing epstein-barr virus, enterovirus, 
coxiella burnetii parvovirus b19 revealed evidence subtype-specific
relationships epstein-barr virus enterovirus, two common
infectious triggers cfs/me.
conclusions: study confirms involvement genes cfs/me.
