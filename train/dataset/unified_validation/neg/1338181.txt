human papillomaviruses (hpv) large group dna viruses, 60 types
identified date, cause development benign tumors skin 
and mucosal squamous epithelia. tumors regress spontaneously but
some, especially mucosal membranes, become malignant. hpv types a
high risk inducing malignancies (e.g. 16 18) subject of
increasing interest. hpvs host-specific tissue-specific: types 
preferentially infect specific epithelia, giving rise lesions distinct
topographic characteristics. hpvs difficult study not
replicate available vitro models. vivo, hpvs replicate well in
epithelial cells undergoing terminal differentiation, e.g. keratinized cells. 
some 40 different types reported epidermal keratinocytes, most
common types 1 2 produce large amounts viral antigens and
viral particles. contrast, hpvs replicate poorly weakly keratinized
squamous epithelia line digestive, respiratory, genital tracts.
junctional epithelia, e.g. uterine cervix, especially prone hpv
infection. prevalent hpv types benign genital lesions types 6 and
11, whose characteristic features include extrachromosomal dna production 
only small amounts viral antigens. profound nuclear cytoplasmic
changes induced hpvs lead formation koïlocytes found
mainly granular layer epithelia especially well described
in uterine cervix vagina. hpv epithelial tumors squamous cell
carcinomas often harbor hpv types 16 18; especially true of
cervical intraepithelial neoplasias. tumors contain viral dna, which
may may integrated cellular dna, whereas viral antigens are
lacking. high incidence broad spectrum hpv types found patients
with acquired immunodeficiencies (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy) suggest a
key role cellular immunity development hpv-induced lesions. a
number cofactors, including uv radiations smoking, well oncogene
activation anti-oncogene inactivation, may increase risk progression
to malignancy.
