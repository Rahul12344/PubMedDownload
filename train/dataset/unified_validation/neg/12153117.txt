human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (aids) serious problems since 1980s. progression 
of hiv infection aids suppressed extent reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (rtis) protease inhibitors (pis); however, are
some serious problems treatments using anti-hiv drugs (e.g. high
expense, complicated administration, drug resistance). hence, studies on
hiv development effective anti-hiv treatments required. we
consider important understand complex dynamics involved hiv
infection, therefore propose new mathematical models hiv infection. 
the modeling, paid attention nonlinear relations stimuli
and responses (i.e., responses plotted logarithm stimuli,
a sigmoid curve obtained), lymphoid organs seem important
than blood compartment (i.e., lymphoid organs major reservoirs hiv
virions contain lymphocytes). using models, found
that viral antigenic mutation plays important role slow progression 
the chronic phase hiv infection. also found viral antigenic
mutation cause relapse hiv infection inhibition rate anti-hiv 
drugs low viral antigenic mutation cannot cause relapse the
inhibition rate high.
