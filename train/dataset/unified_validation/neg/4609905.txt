the synergistic role infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) mixed infections of
mycoplasma synoviae (ms) escherichia coli (ec) airsacculitis syndrome 
was evaluated gnotobiotic chickens. relative air sac lesion score indexes, 
descending order severity, various combinations organisms were:
9.5-ibv, ms, ec; 6.8-ibv, ec; 4.5-ibv, ms; 2.7-ibv; 0.5-ms, ec. infectious
bronchitis virus caused mild fibrinous inflammation. m. synoviae combined 
ibv increased heterophilic follicular lymphoid infiltration mortality. e.
coli combined ibv increased exudation prolonged airsacculitis.
concentrations fibrinogen, gamma globulin, total plasma proteins were
elevated significantly combined infections ibv, ms, ec (p < 0.01).
