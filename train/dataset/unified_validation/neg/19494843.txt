radiation therapy, mainstay anti-tumor therapeutic regimens variety
of tumor types, triggers tumor cell apoptotic pathways either directly
eliciting dna damage indirectly inducing formation oxygen radicals. 
an effort augment radiation therapy, generated double e1b 19 kda- e1b
55 kda-deleted oncolytic adenovirus (ad-deltae1b19/55). combination with
radiotherapy, greater cytotoxicity observed ad-deltae1b19/55 the
single e1b 55 kda-deleted oncolytic ad (ad-deltae1b55). consistent this
observation, higher levels p53, phospho-p53, phospho-chk1, phospho-chk2, pi3k 
(phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase), phospho-akt, cytochrome c, cleavage parp 
(poly (adp-ribose) polymerase) caspase-3 observed cells treated 
ad-deltae1b19/55 compared treated ad-deltae1b55, indicating 
the e1b 19 kda present ad-deltae1b55 may partially block radiation-induced
apoptosis. significant therapeutic benefit also observed vivo when
oncolytic ads radiation combined. tumors treated ad-deltae1b19/55
and radiation showed large areas necrosis apoptosis corresponding
induction p53. finally, consistent vitro observations, combination
of ad-deltae1b19/55 radiation efficacious combination of
ad-deltae1b55 radiation. taken together, results present strong
therapeutic rationale combining radiation therapy e1b 19 kda-deleted
oncolytic ad.
