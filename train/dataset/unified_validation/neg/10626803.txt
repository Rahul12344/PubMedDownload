cervical cancer emerges cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) induced 
high-risk hpv (hr-hpv) infections. however, vast majority cin lesions
regresses spontaneously, lesions persist progress invasive
carcinoma. basis morphological criteria, possible to
differentiate high-grade lesions regress persist that
inevitably progress invasive cancers. cervical carcinomas, human 
papillomavirus (hpv) genomes integrated host cell chromosomes and
transcribed mrnas encompassing viral cellular sequences. contrast, in
early preneoplastic lesions, hpv genomes persist episomes, derived
transcripts contain exclusively viral sequences. thus, detection hpv
transcripts derived integrated hpv genomes may specifically indicate both
cin lesions high risk progression well invasive cervical cancers.
here, established protocol amplification papillomavirus oncogene 
transcripts (apot) cervical specimens allows us distinguish episome-
from integrate-derived hpv mrnas. cervical swab biopsy samples 549
patients attending outpatient clinics cervical dysplasia screened for
the presence hpv dna, 155 samples positive either hpv type
16 (n = 143) 18 (n = 12) subjected apot assay. samples derived 
from normal cervical epithelia (n = 19) low-grade cervical lesions (cin i, n =
10), integrate-derived hpv transcripts found. contrast, 1 (5%) of
22 samples derived cin ii lesions, 10 (16%) 64 samples patients
with cin iii lesions, 35 (88%) 40 samples patients cervical
cancer, integrate-derived hpv transcripts detected. thus, detection of
integrate-derived hpv transcripts cervical swabs biopsy specimens the
apot assay points advanced dysplasia invasive cervical cancer.
