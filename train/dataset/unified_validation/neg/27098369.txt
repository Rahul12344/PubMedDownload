early detection ebola virus (ebov) infection essential halting
transmission adjudicating appropriate treatment. however, current methods
rely viral identification, approach misdiagnose presymptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals. contrast, disease-driven alterations host
transcriptome exploited pathogen-specific diagnostic biomarkers. here,
we present first time ebov-induced changes circulating mirna
populations nonhuman primates (nhps) humans. retrospectively profiled
longitudinally-collected plasma samples rhesus macaques challenged via
intramuscular aerosol routes found 36 mirnas differentially present in
both groups. comparison mirna abundances viral loads uncovered 15 highly
correlated mirnas common ebov-infected nhps humans. proof principle,
we developed eight-mirna classifier correctly categorized infection
status 64/74 (86%) human nhp samples. classifier identified acute
infections 27/29 (93.1%) samples 6/12 (50%) presymptomatic nhps. 
findings showed applicability nhp-derived mirnas human cohort, with
additional research resulting classifiers could impact current capability
to diagnose presymptomatic asymptomatic ebov infections.
