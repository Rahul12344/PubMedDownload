hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection uncommon children, natural
history still unknown. aim analyze exposure hcv 48 infants
and children argentina evaluate consecutive samples 26 to
study outcome hcv infection early stages. hcv viremia, determined by
reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) 5' untranslated region, showed
continuously positive, occasionally positive, negative patterns during
follow-up. restriction fragment length polymorphism performed on
rt-pcr-positive samples evaluate hcv genotype. genotype 1 turned be
predominant, patient displayed genotype shift observation
period. perinatal hcv infection predominantly observed patients born to
mothers coinfected hcv human immunodeficiency virus. hcv viral load 
detected means amplicor monitor, version 2.0, kit. correlation was
observed hcv viral load alanine aminotransferase aspartate
aminotransferase levels, although detected trend towards higher levels among
patients displaying consecutive positive hcv rt-pcr results. results
demonstrate pediatric hcv infection characterized high viral loads and
diverse hcv viremia patterns, independent age route transmission
in population study. research necessary determine whether
the high rate hcv replication related virus variability host
immune response.
