somatic hybridization interesting alternative selection of
heterozygous vigorous potato plants combination dihaploid genomes.
the resulting hybrids harbour interesting characters thus used 
agriculture agreement agronomic criteria. report, 
used intraspecific somatic hybridization technique production of
tetraploid potato lines. two parental combinations used protoplast
electrofusion procedure: aminca-cardinal cardinal-nicola. selection of
somatic hybrids based vitro plant vigour. therefore, among 75
regenerated plants obtained aminca-cardinal fusion, 3 putative hybrids 
retained 2 plant lines selected among 54 regenerated the
cardinal-nicola fusion. heterosis observed larger hybrid tuber size
compared parents'. results also showed precocity vitro
tuberization hybrids. moreover, regenerated putative hybrids
were tetraploid (2n=4x=48 chromosomes). isocitrate dehydrogenase malate
dehydrogenase isoenzyme analyses confirmed hybrid nature lines. a
molecular characterization performed pcr amplification simple sequence
repeats inter-simple sequence repeats confirmed lines were
somatic hybrids. effect potato virus infection hybrid lines was
tested mechanical inoculation plants cultivated greenhouse. the
majority displayed reduction infection rate associated delayed
appearance symptoms compared parents. moreover, complete resistance was
noted one hybrid line (cn2). hybrids also showed improved tolerance to
pythium aphanidermatum infection tuber storage plant inoculation.
