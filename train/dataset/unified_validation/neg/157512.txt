[article french]

chomarat m, fleurette j.

a comparison done various characters 170 non epidemic strains
cultivated hospitalized patients 29 strains originated healthy
carriers without hospital contact antibiotic treatment since 6 months.
following characters tested: m.i.c. 13 antibiotics, heterogenous
methicillin resistance, enzymatic antibiotic resistance, macrolide inducible or
constitutive type resistance, mercuric chloride susceptibility; phage types;
enzymes toxins production. antigenic structure studied, in
particular production protein a, beta teichoc acid type antigens.
significant differences observed hospital healthy carriers 
strains; later strains antibiotic susceptible, produce toxins and
enzymes, frequently phage typable. antigenic structure shows also
significant differences: beta-teichoic acid less frequently detected; type
antigens less frequent different. role surface antigens in
virulence discussed.
