high spontaneous mutation frequency bpv shuttle vector.

ashman cr, davidson rl.

a recombinant shuttle vector containing entire bovine papillomavirus (bpv)
genome, sequences pbr322, escherichia coli gpt gene used to
transform mouse c127 cells. plasmid extracted transformed mouse cells
was used transform gpt- derivative e. coli hb101, relative
frequency plasmids carrying mutation gpt gene determined.
approximate mutant frequencies 3-16 x 10(-3) observed plasmid
molecules passaged mammalian cells. restriction digest
analysis indicated mutant plasmid molecules gross
rearrangements dna structures.
