background: liver disease chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection ranges
from minimal lesions liver cirrhosis, eventually evolving hepatocellular
carcinoma. whether hcv determines different clinical histological
manifestations disease fully understood.
aims: verify whether amount virus individual patients could be
related severity liver injury.
patients methods: levels hcv rna measured serum 96 consecutive 
patients chronic hepatitis type c using signal amplification assay. the
relation viraemic values corresponding viral load liver
was assessed subgroup 21 patients hcv rna measured serum
samples liver specimens obtained time.
results: positive correlation observed amount viral nucleic 
acid two compartments, indicating levels viraemia reflect the
amount virus present liver. viral load correlate with
aminotransferase activities histological diagnosis, serum liver 
levels hcv rna significantly different patients infected the
various hcv genotypes.
conclusions: measurement hcv replication serum mirror viral
replication liver. extent replicative activity hcv seem
to play role modulation associated hepatic disease.
