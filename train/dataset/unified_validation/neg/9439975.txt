we recently cloned gene whose protein product binds epstein-barr virus
bzlf1 gene promoter. gene previously cloned another group
who named mu bp-2 protein product binds mu motif the
immunoglobulin heavy chain gene postulated function in
immunoglobulin class switching. current study, confirm mu
bp-2 gene located chromosome 11q13, locus known altered by
translocation 50-70% mantle cell lymphomas. used southern blot analysis 
to determine whether mu bp-2 gene structurally rearranged 25 
mantle cell lymphomas. found evidence rearrangement these
lymphomas including 18 proven contain t(11;14) cytogenetic
analysis. data suggest structural alteration mu bp-2 gene 
not underlying mechanism tumorigenesis mantle cell lymphomas.
