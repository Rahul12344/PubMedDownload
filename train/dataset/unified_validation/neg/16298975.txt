the coronavirus nucleocapsid (n) protein viral rna-binding protein with
multiple functions terms virus replication modulating cell signalling
pathways. n protein composed three distinct regions containing rna-binding 
motif(s), appropriate signals modulating cell signalling. subcellular
localization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) n
protein studied. infected cells, sars-cov n protein localized exclusively 
to cytoplasm. contrast avian coronavirus n protein, overexpressed
sars-cov n protein remained principally localized cytoplasm, few
cells exhibiting nucleolar localization. bioinformatic analysis deletion
mutagenesis coupled confocal microscopy live-cell imaging, revealed that
sars-cov n protein regions iii contained nuclear localization signals and
region ii contained nucleolar retention signal. however, cytoplasmic
localization directed region iii dominant localization signal 
in protein.
