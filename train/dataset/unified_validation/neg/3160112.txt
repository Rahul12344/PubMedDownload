staphylococcal enterotoxin encoded phage.

betley mj, mekalanos jj.

the gene staphylococcal enterotoxin (enta), two wild-type strains, is
carried related temperate bacteriophages. hybridization analysis dna from
enta-converting phage ps42-d bacterial host suggests phage
integrates bacterial chromosome circularization reciprocal
crossover (the campbell model) enta gene located near phage
attachment site. dna three eight staphylococcal strains not
produce enterotoxin seven wild-type enterotoxin a-producing (enta+) strains
had extensive homology enta-converting phage ps42-d dna, although there
was high degree restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. least one
enta+ strain produce detectable viable phage induction. data 
indicate polymorphic family staphylococcus aureus phages (some which
may defective) carry enta gene.
