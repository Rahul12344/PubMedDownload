site-specific recombinases (ssrs) crucial development of
mammalian transgenesis. gene therapy purposes, approach remains
challenging, because, example, ssr delivery largely unresolved ssr dna
substrates must pre-exist target cells. review, discuss the
potential his-hydrophobic-his (huh) recombinases overcome the
limitations conventional ssrs. members huh protein family cleave
single-stranded (ss)dna, mediate site-specific integration aid
of host replication machinery. adeno-associated virus (aav) rep remains the
only known example support site-specific integration human cells, aav
is excellent gene delivery vector targeted specific cells and
organelles. bacterial protein trwc catalyzes integration human sequences and
can delivered human cells covalently linked dna, offering attractive new
features targeted genome modification.
