during last decades, incidence type 1 diabetes (t1d) increased
significantly, reaching percentages 3% annually worldwide. increase
suggests besides genetical factors environmental perturbations (including
viral infections) also involved pathogenesis t1d. t1d been
associated viral infections including enteroviruses, rubella, mumps,
rotavirus, parvovirus cytomegalovirus (cmv). although correlations between
clinical presentation t1d occurrence viral infection that
precedes development overt disease recognized, causalities
between viruses diabetogenic process still elusive difficult to
prove humans. use experimental animal models therefore
indispensable, indeed insight mechanism viruses can
modulate diabetogenesis provided studies rodent models t1d
such biobreeding (bb) rat, nonobese diabetic (nod) mouse specific
transgenic mouse strains. data experimental animals well vitro
studies indicate various viruses clearly able modulate the
development t1d via different mechanisms, including direct beta-cell lysis,
bystander activation autoreactive cells, loss regulatory cells and
molecular mimicry. data obtained rodents vitro systems improved
our insight possible role viral infections pathogenesis human
t1d. future studies hopefully reveal human viruses causally
involved induction t1d knowledge may provide directions how
to deal viral infections diabetes-susceptible individuals order to
delay even prevent diabetogenic process.
