hepatitis c virus (hcv) successful pathogen grounds exploits 
its host's metabolism build viral particles; moreover favours own
survival inducing chronic disease development specific anatomic
changes infected organ. steatosis, therefore, associated hcv
infection necessity rather chance alone. approximately 6% hcv
patients steatohepatitis. interestingly, hcv steatosis occurs setting
of multiple metabolic abnormalities (hyperuricemia, reversible
hypocholesterolemia, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension expansion of
visceral adipose tissue) collectively referred "hepatitis c-associated
dysmetabolic syndrome" (hcads). general, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(nafld)-like, mechanisms steatogenesis (including increased availability of
lipogenic substrates de novo lipogenesis; decreased oxidation fatty
substrates export fatty substrates) shared hcv genotypes.
however, genotype 3 seemingly amplifies steatogenic molecular mechanisms
reported occur nafld via profound changes microsomal triglyceride
transfer protein; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; sterol
regulatory element-binding proteins phosphatase tensin homologue. hcv
steatosis remarkable clinical impact much acknowledged
risk factor accelerated fibrogenesis; impaired treatment response to
interferon ribavirin; development hepatocellular carcinoma. recent
data, moreover, suggest hcv-steatosis contributes premature atherogenesis
via direct indirect mechanisms. conclusion, hcv steatosis fulfills
all expected requirements necessary perpetuate hcv life cycle. better
understanding physiology hcads likely result successful 
handling disease improved antiviral success rates.
