a clinical trial conducted compare combination measles, mumps,
rubella, varicella vaccine (mmrv) standard measles, mumps, rubella
vaccine subsequent varicella vaccine (mmr + v) 15 17 month old healthy 
children. mmrv mmr + v schedules stimulated virtually 100%
seroconversion component viruses. mean antibody titers similar for
each virus component two vaccine groups. clinical reactivity post
immunization also similar 25-29% morbilliform rashes, 12-25% mild
papulovesicular (varicella) rashes, 12.5-18% temperature elevations 101
degrees f. antibodies measles, mumps, rubella viruses persistent in
8/10 originally seronegative mmrv vaccinees 5/5 mmr + v recipients tested. on
mmrv recipient household exposure chickenpox year
postvaccination resulted subclinical boost varicella antibody titer.
two children mmr + v group close varicella exposures: one developed
mild varicella (20 lesions). known exposures natural measles,
mumps, rubella. three four mmrv vaccinees low titer antibody to
varicella prior immunization greater four-fold rises antibodies.
the combination measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine immunogenic,
safe cost effective approach varicella immunization healthy children.
