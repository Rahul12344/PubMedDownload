alloantisera specific b-g antigens recognized complex molecules of
apparent molecular weights 90 98 kd nonreducing conditions and
molecules 40, 44, 48 kd reducing conditions embryo- and
adult-derived peripheral red blood cells (rbc). chicken b-g molecules
produced unique two-dimensional "diagonal" pattern. two antisera permitted 
characterization complex b-g molecular profile homodimer composed 
48-kd subunits heterodimer composed 40- 44-kd subunits. rabbit 
antiserum produced b-g molecules preferentially recognized 48-kd
reduced molecules, suggesting 90-kd molecule homodimer composed of
two 48-kd molecules. one b-g reagent capable recognizing 98-kd
nonreduced b-g molecule gave rise 40- 44-kd molecules reducing 
conditions, suggesting 98-kd molecule heterodimer composed 44- 
and 40-kd subunits. adult chicken b-g2 molecules produced variety of
two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (ief/sds-page) patterns depending characteristics the
reagent employed immunoprecipitation. b-g molecules were
immunoprecipitated primitive definitive chicken rbcs any
nonerythroid cells tested. b-g molecules expressed avian
erythroblastosis virus (aev)-transformed erythroleukemia cells, they
induced appear butyric acid-induced erythroid differentiation.
