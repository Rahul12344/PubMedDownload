a prominent pathogenic facet theileria infections parasite infects
lymphocytes 'transforms' parasitized lymphoblastoid cells are
highly proliferative cultured indefinitely vitro. analyse the
relationship intracellular parasite lymphocyte transformation 
have studied effects eliminating parasites lymphoblastoid cells
using naphthoquinone derivative 993.c. treatment theileria-infected
lymphoblastoid cells 993.c gradually eliminates intracellular parasites 
cell proliferation inhibited several days parasite
elimination. proliferating cells longer contain schizont particles are
medium-sized lymphocytes small blast cells. surface phenotype these
cells, defined lectins monoclonal antibodies, remains unchanged after
parasite elimination. division non-parasitized cells, culture
conditions examined, indefinite. compound 993.c not
appear mitogenic possible mechanisms continued division are
discussed. previously reported co-cultivation irradiated
theileria-infected lymphoblastoid cells autologous lymphocytes induces
marked dna synthesis latter. examined relevance this
observation immunity theileria using lymphoblastoid cells treated 
993.c. elimination intracellular parasites compound impair
the ability cells stimulate dna synthesis autologous lymphocytes. 
furthermore, lymphocytes theileria-immune non-immune cattle react
similarly. reaction differs classical mixed lymphocyte reaction
induced antigens encoded main histocompatibility complex since the
stimulator cells exclusively lymphocyte-derived cells, magnitude of
response greater stimulated lymphocytes able act 'stimulator
cells' fresh autologous lymphocytes. thus question immunological
relevance observed lymphocyte division. possibility that
theileria-infected lymphoblastoid cells carry viral genomes infectious virus
particles discussed. preliminary electron microscopic studies not
revealed virus particles.
