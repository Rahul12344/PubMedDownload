proto-oncogene c-mos, cellular homologue transforming gene moloney 
murine sarcoma virus, characterized lack expression a
variety differentiated tissues, possibly existence an
inhibitory upstream sequence. detected mos-related transcripts in
undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells pluripotential cell line 311. the
sizes three major transcripts detected estimated 1.8, 4.6 and
6.1-kilobases (kb) northern analysis. furthermore, transcriptions were
suppressed cell differentiation induced retinoic acid. taken
together, results suggest mos product plays role early stages of
development.
