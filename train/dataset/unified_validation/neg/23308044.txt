promising phase ii clinical results reported recently several
oncolytic viral therapeutics, including strains based vaccinia virus. one
reason increased appreciation critical therapeutic
importance immune response raised viruses. however, most
commonly used approaches enhance immunotherapeutic effects oncolytic 
viruses, typically though expression cytokine transgenes, often also result in
a reduction oncolytic activity premature clearance virotherapy from
the tumor. approaches enhance immunotherapeutic effects while
maintaining oncolytic activity would therefore beneficial. here, is
demonstrated expression chemokine ccl19 (elc) oncolytic
vaccinia virus (vvccl19) results increased antitumor effects syngeneic
mouse tumor models. corresponded increased cell dendritic cell
infiltration tumor. however, vvccl19 persisted tumor at
equivalent levels control virus without ccl19, demonstrating oncolytic 
activity curtailed. instead, vvccl19 cleared rapidly selectively 
from normal tissues organs, indicating potentially increased safety
profile. therapeutic activity vvccl19 could significantly
increased combination adoptive transfer therapeutic immune cells 
expressing ccr7, receptor ccl19. approach therefore represents a
means increase safety therapeutic benefit oncolytic viruses, used
alone combination immune cell therapies.
