to enter b-cell follicles, genetically modified unselected cd8 cells to
express cxc chemokine receptor 5 (cxcr5), chemokine receptor implicated in
cellular entry b-cell follicles. engineered cd8 cells expressing human
cxcr5 (cd8hcxcr5) exhibited ligand-specific signaling chemotaxis vitro six
infected rhesus macaques infused differentially fluorescent dye-labeled
autologous cd8hcxcr5 untransduced cd8 cells necropsied 48 h later. flow
cytometry spleen lymph node samples revealed higher frequencies of
cd8hcxcr5 untransduced cells, consistent preferential trafficking to
b-cell follicle-containing tissues. confocal fluorescence microscopy of

infected follicular helper cd4 cells, tfh, present inside b-cell follicles
represent major source residual virus. effective cd8 t-cell
responses control viral replication conjunction drug therapy in
rare cases spontaneously, antiviral cd8 cells enter b-cell
follicles, fail robustly control viral replication the
tfh population. thus, sites sanctuary reservoir replicating
aids viruses. here, demonstrate engineering unselected cd8 cells to
express cxcr5, chemokine receptor tfh associated b-cell follicle

results open pathway directing engineered antiviral cells these
viral sanctuaries help eliminate source persistent virus.
