the e2 proteins papillomaviruses (pv) bind coactivator cbp/p300 do
many transcription factors, precise role cbp/p300 e2-specific
functions yet understood. show e2 protein human pv type 8
(hpv8) directly binds p300. activation hpv8 gene expression low amounts 
of hpv8 e2 stimulated sevenfold coexpression p300. the
interaction e2 p300 may play role differentiation-dependent
activation pv gene expression, since show expression level 
p300 increases keratinocyte differentiation. surprisingly,
sequence-specific binding e2 recognition sites within regulatory
region hpv8 necessary cooperation, indicating e2 be
recruited promoter via protein-protein interaction. hpv8 e2 binds via 
n-terminal activation domain (ad), c-terminal dna binding domain (dbd), and
its internal hinge region p300 vitro. transient-transfection assays
revealed ad necessary sufficient cooperative activation 
p300. however, provide evidence interaction hinge dbd 
of hpv8 e2 p300 may contribute. data suggest important role p300
in regulation hpv8 gene expression reveal new mechanism e2 may 
be recruited promoter activate transcription without sequence specific
dna binding.
