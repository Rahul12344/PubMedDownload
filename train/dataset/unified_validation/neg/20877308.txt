the aim study evaluate outcomes robot-assisted laparoscopic 
prostatectomy (ralp) prostate cancer (pca) patients human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv). prospective cohort study hiv patients 
undergoing ralp, comparing demographics, tumor characteristics,
complications, short-term oncological outcomes hiv-positive men to
hiv-negative men using univariate (Ï‡(2), mann-whitney test) multivariable
(logistic regression) analyses. 2007 2010, 298 men underwent ralp, 8 of
whom known hiv positive. preoperatively, eight taking highly 
active antiretroviral therapy (haart) undetectable viral loads (<50);
mean cd4 count 634 cells per mm(3). hiv-positive men younger (54 versus 
62 years, p=0.010) less likely white (p=0.007). no
significant differences groups respect clinical staging,
pathological oncological outcomes complication rates. however, the
prevalence perioperative transfusions (p=0.031) ileus (p=0.021) were
higher hiv-positive patients. hiv remained significantly associated risk 
of transfusion adjustment age, race, gleason sum clinical stage
(p=0.002). median 2.6 (range 0.03-19.2) months follow-up, psa
remained undetectable eight hiv patients. data suggest ralp 
safe for, demonstrates short-term oncological efficacy in, hiv-positive
patients pca.
