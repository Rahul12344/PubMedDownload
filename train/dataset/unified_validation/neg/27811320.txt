to evaluate antigenic relationship bat mumps virus (bmv) jl5 
vaccine strain mumps virus (muvjl5), rescued chimeric virus bearing f
and hn glycoproteins bmv background recombinant jl5 genome
(rmuvjl5). cross-reactivity cross-neutralization chimeric
recombinant muv bearing f hn glycoproteins bmv (rmuvjl5-f/hnbmv) virus
and rmuvjl5 demonstrated using hyperimmune mouse serum samples curated
panel human serum. mouse human serum samples able to
neutralize rmuvjl5 infection cross-neutralizing activity against
rmuvjl5-f/hnbmv. data suggest persons neutralizing antibodies
against muv might protected infection bmv.
