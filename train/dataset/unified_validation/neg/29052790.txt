background: once-daily, orally administered, co-formulated glecaprevir (ns3/4a
protease inhibitor) pibrentasvir (ns5a inhibitor) (g/p) demonstrated
pangenotypic activity high sustained virologic response (svr) rates in
studies outside japan. report safety efficacy subset japanese
patients chronic hcv infection received g/p 300/120 mg phase 3,
open-label, multicenter study (certain-1).
methods: analysis focuses three difficult-to-treat subgroups: hcv
gt1/2-infected patients failed achieve svr treatment direct
acting antiviral (daa)-containing regimen; gt1/2-infected patients severe
renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2); 
gt3-infected patients. patients renal impairment gt3 cohorts were
treatment-naive interferon treatment-experienced. noncirrhotic gt1/2-infected,
daa-naïve patients renal impairment cohort received g/p 8 weeks; all
other patients treated 12 weeks. primary outcome svr (hcv
rna < 15 iu/ml) 12 weeks post-treatment (svr12).
results: study enrolled 33 gt1/2-infected patients failed previous daa
treatment (four cirrhosis); 12 gt1/2-infected patients severe renal
impairment (two cirrhosis); 12 gt3-infected patients (two with
cirrhosis). svr12 achieved 31/33 (93.9%), 12/12 (100%), 10/12 (83.3%) 
patients, respectively. one serious adverse event (fluid overload, related to
g/p) occurred patient chronic intermittent hemodialysis.
conclusions: g/p achieved high svr12 rates well tolerated three
difficult-to-treat patient subgroups limited treatment options japan
(daa-experienced patients, patients severe renal impairment, and
gt3-infected patients). results support potential suitability this
regimen special populations japan.
