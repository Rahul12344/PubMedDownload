multivalent receptor-mediated interactions virions lipid membrane
can weakened using competitive nonpathogenic ligand binding. particular,
the subsequent binding ligands induce detachment bound virions, 
phenomenon crucial relevance development new antiviral drugs.
focusing simian virus 40 (sv40) recombinant cholera toxin b subunit
(rctb), using (monosialotetrahexosyl)ganglioside (gm1) common
receptor supported lipid bilayer (slb), present first detailed
investigation phenomenon employing quartz crystal microbalance
with dissipation (qcm-d) total internal reflection fluorescence (tirf)
microscopy assisted 2d single particle tracking (spt) techniques. analysis the
qcm-d-measured release kinetics made possible determine binding
strength single sv40-gm1 pair. release dynamics sv40, monitored by
