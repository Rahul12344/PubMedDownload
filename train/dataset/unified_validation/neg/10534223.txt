objective: examine evidence regarding therapeutic effectiveness of
lamivudine treatment chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in
immunocompetent patients.
data sources: using chronic hepatitis b lamivudine mesh headings, medline 
was searched 1966 september 1998 published randomized controlled 
trials evaluating lamivudine chronic hbv infection. relevant articles from
selected bibliographies also retrieved.
study selection: randomized, single- double-blind trials human hbv
carriers published english language included.
data synthesis: evidence controlled trials suggests lamivudine 
a therapeutic effect suppressing hbv replication immunocompetent patients. 
lamivudine 100 mg/d appears suppress hbv replication many 97% of
patients within two weeks initiation therapy capable of
suppressing histologic damages. however, viral suppression effective only
during therapy; discontinuation lamivudine therapy, patients
return pretreatment condition. viral resistance lamivudine been
observed. patients chronic hbv infection appear tolerate 100 mg/d of
lamivudine therapy.
conclusions: evidence shown oral lamivudine 100 mg/d produce rapid 
and significant suppression viral replication immunocompetent patients with
chronic hbv infections. treatment periods one year effective 
well tolerated. suppression viral replication may sustained after
cessation lamivudine therapy, patients complete elimination 
of hbv therapy. therefore, long treatment periods may necessary.
efficacy tolerability treatment beyond one year need investigated.
resistance lamivudine reported patients receiving therapy. a
combination anti-hbv regimen using lamivudine agents different
mechanisms action investigated maximize elimination the
viral infection minimizing preventing damage liver cells and
tissues development viral resistance.
