the red yeast rhodosporidium toruloide versatile host production of
lipids carotenoids. genetic tools underdeveloped red yeasts due to
their unique genetics physiology. currently expression heterogonous gene
in red yeasts largely based integration designed cassette by
agrobacterium mediated transformation, yet method somewhat restricted
when multiple genes required expressed due lack functional
genetic elements. demonstrate virus 2a sequence effective to
mediate co-expression multiple enzymes r. toruloides. two different 2a
sequences, porcine teschovirus-1 2a (p2a) foot-and-mouth disease virus 2a
(f2a), evaluated. found p2a sequence effective for
co-expression two antibiotic selection markers. co-expression three
antibiotic resistance proteins successful single promoter mediated 
p2a sequence. three heterogeneous enzymes responsible β-carotene
biosynthesis co-expressed, recombinant r. toruloides strains produced 
4.5-fold β-carotene parental one. use 2a sequence
can facilitate cassette construction engineer advanced cell factories for
production lipids related oleochemicals.
