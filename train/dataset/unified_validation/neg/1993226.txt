the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique powerful new tool for
amplifying target dna, thus allowing sensitive detection specific nucleic 
acid sequences. one important potential use pcr involves screening donated
blood supply transfusion-transmitted viruses. realization goal has
been limited (1) requirement multiple, discrete pcr reactions to
amplify detect target sequences one virus, (2) lack a
rapid, nonhazardous means specific detection one pcr-amplified
products. report simultaneous amplification three distinct target
sequences without discernable loss sensitivity toward single target
sequence. also demonstrate rapid separation detection of
pcr-amplified viral dna use automated capillary dna
chromatography. amplified dna peaks initially identified scanning the
capillary effluent ultraviolet wavelengths, discrimination human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 human t-cell leukemic virus type i
pcr-amplified dna accomplished use virus-specific, fluorescently
labeled primers probes. results indicate progress toward automated
system screening blood supply nucleic acid sequences multiple
pathogens.
