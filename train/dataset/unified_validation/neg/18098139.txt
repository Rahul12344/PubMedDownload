the use oncolytic recombinant polioviruses important therapeutic
potential treatment human gliomas. study carried assess
parameters utility oncolytic poliovirus/human rhinovirus type 2
chimeras (pv/hrv2). prototype pv/hrv2 chimera constructed containing 
complete genome wild-type pv type 1 (mahoney) [pv1(m)] cognate
ires replaced hrv2 [called pv1(ripo)]. derivative pv1(ripo)
is pv1(ripos) capsid coding region (p1) replaced the
capsid-coding region pv type 1 (sabin) [pv1(s)] vaccine strain. in
addition, third pv/hrv2 chimera constructed containing complete genome 
of pv1(s) cognate ires replaced hrv2 [termed
pvs(ripo)]. analyze growth phenotypes pv/hrv2 recombinants [pv1(ripo), 
pv1(ripos), pvs(ripo)], one-step growth experiments performed four human 
cell lines three different temperatures. address safety profile,
pvs(ripo) injected brain cd155 tg mice dose 10(7) pfu.
then, clinical signs, persistence virus cns genetic stability
of pvs(ripo) replicating cns evaluated. data obtained the
present study suggest (i) correlation temperature-sensitive (ts)
phenotype neuronal non-neuronal cell lines neuroattenuation in
experimental animals, (ii) pvs (ripo) genetically stable replication
in cns poliovirus-susceptible mice. findings highlight safety of
intracerebral inoculation pvs(ripo) treatment human glioma.
