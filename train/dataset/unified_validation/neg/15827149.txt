envelope proteins hepadnaviruses undergo unique folding mechanism which
results posttranslational translocation 50% large envelope
protein (l) chains across endoplasmic reticulum. mechanism essential 
for eventual positioning receptor-binding domain surface the
virus particle duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) dependent small (s)
envelope protein part assembly process. study, report the
identification third envelope protein, st, derived protein and
carrying functions previously attributed s. antibody mapping mutagenesis
studies indicated st c terminally truncated, spanning n-terminal
transmembrane domain (tm1) plus adjacent cysteine loop. previously
shown mutation two conserved polar residues tm1 (saa)
eliminates l translocation assembly. plasmid expressing functional
equivalent st able rescue assembly, demonstrating assembly
defect due mutations corresponding residues st per
se. immunofluorescence analysis showed st directly affects l protein
cellular localization. results indicate st acts viral chaperone
for l folding, remaining associated dhbv envelope upon secretion. the
presence st molar ratio half l suggests st which
regulates l translocation 50%.
