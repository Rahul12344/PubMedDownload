comparative studies sequence motifs rna polymerases nucleic acid
helicases positive-sense rna plant viruses provided new scheme 
classification pathogens. propose new luteovirus supergroup which
should added already described sindbisvirus-like picornavirus-like 
supergroups. sequence motifs nucleic acid helicases rna polymerases 
previously considered specific two supergroups now
occur together within new supergroup. propose new viral
supergroup provides evolutionary link two supergroups.
