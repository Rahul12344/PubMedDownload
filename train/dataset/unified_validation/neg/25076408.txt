background: hepatitis c viral (hcv) proteins, including core, demonstrate
immuno-modulatory properties; however, effect extracellular core on
natural killer (nk) cells previously investigated.
aims: characterise nks acute hcv infection time, and, examine the
effect exogenous hcv-core protein nk cell phenotype function.
methods: acute hcv patients (n = 22), including 10 subjects spontaneously
recovered, prospectively studied. flow-cytometry used measure natural
cytotoxicity phenotype nks directly ex vivo culture with
hcv-core protein. microarray analysis used identify pathways involved in
the nk cell response exogenous hcv-core.
results: direct ex vivo analysis demonstrated increased frequency of
immature/regulatory cd56bright nks early acute hcv infection per se which
normalized viral clearance. natural cytotoxicity reduced not
recover viral clearance. statistically significant correlation 
between frequency cd56bright nks circulating serum levels hcv core 
protein. vitro culture purified cd56bright nk cells hcv-core protein
in presence il-15 maintained significant proportion nks the
cd56bright state. vitro effect core closely correlates nk
characteristics measured directly ex vivo acute hcv infection. pathway
analysis suggests hcv-core protein attenuates nk interferon type i
responses.
conclusions: data suggest hcv-core protein alters nk cell maturation and
may influence outcome acute infection.
