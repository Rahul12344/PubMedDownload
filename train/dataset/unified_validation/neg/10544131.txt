the putative, 3'-terminal stem-loop structure satellite tobacco necrosis virus
strain c (stnv-c) rna constitutes essential cis-acting structure the
promotion negative-strand rna synthesis single-stranded tail also
important. putative, 5'-terminal stem-loop structure stnv-c rna not
essential productive, plus-strand rna accumulation required for
optimal accumulation. residues 2 3 minimal cis-acting sequences
required rna synthesis. rna chimeric mutants, exchanged 3'- 
5'-untranslated regions stnv-c helper tobacco necrosis virus strain d
rnas, accumulated protoplasts, implying similar replication mechanisms for
both rnas.
