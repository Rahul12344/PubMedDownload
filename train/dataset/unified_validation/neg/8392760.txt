renal transplant recipients risk severe morbidity mortality from
cmv disease. undertaken routine surveillance cmv shedding 133
transplant recipients, using rapid culture technique, order assess the
incidence cmv infection disease patients assess the
prognostic significance detection whole blood, throat swab specimens, or
urine. donor cmv seropositivity associated posttransplant cmv infection 
(p < 0.05) disease (p = 0.06). cmv infection disease associated with
the receipt anti-t-cell antibodies (p < 0.0001 p = 0.08, respectively).
first shedding virus site occurred earlier posttransplant those
recipients developed disease (median 39 days) not
(median 55 days)(p < 0.05). detection virus blood occurred median time
of 16 days onset symptoms, compared 9 days symptoms in
urine, 3 days onset symptoms throat swab. positive blood
culture represented relative risk 7.1 subsequent development of
disease, compared 2.1 1.8 positive urine saliva cultures,
respectively. addition urine cultures blood cultures increased the
sensitivity identification risk--however, relative risk was
reduced 5.8. conclude routine surveillance cmv shedding,
especially blood urine, identify recipients high risk cmv
disease, propose trial asymptomatic viremia are
allocated receive ganciclovir placebo, order assess efficacy of
"preemptive" therapy group patients.
