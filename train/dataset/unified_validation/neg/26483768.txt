previous imported cases lassa fever (lf) united kingdom the
ivory coast mali, well detection lassa virus (lasv) among the
mastomys natalensis population within mali led suggestion the
endemic area lf expanding. initial phylogenetic analyses arrange isolates 
from mali ivory coast separately classical lineage iv isolates
taken sierra leone, guinea, liberia. availability full genome
sequences continues increase, allowing complete phylogenetic
comparison isolates mali ivory coast existing
isolates. study, utilized bayesian approach infer demographic
histories lasv isolate full sequence available. our
results indicate isolates mali ivory coast group separately
from isolates lineage iv, comprising distinct fifth lineage. split
between lineages iv v estimated occurred around 200-300 years ago,
which coincides colonial period west africa.
