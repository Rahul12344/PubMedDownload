adeno-associated viruses (aav) currently forefront human gene
therapy clinical trials recombinant vectors. significant progress been
made elucidating structure, biology tropisms different naturally
occurring aav isolates past decade. particular, spectrum aav
capsid interactions host receptors identified characterized.
these studies enabled better understanding key determinants aav cell
recognition entry different hosts. knowledge applied
toward engineering new, lab-derived aav capsids favorable transduction
profiles. current review conveys structural perspective capsid-glycan
interactions provides roadmap generating synthetic strains by
engineering aav receptor footprints.
