human cord-blood lymphocytes infected b95.8 epstein-barr virus (ebv)
before separation b- t-cell populations. lymphoblastoid cells 
exhibiting b-cell characteristics appeared 2 3 days culture the
total population separated b-cell subpopulation t-cell 
subpopulation. ebv nuclear antigen (ebna) detected concurrently the
appearance lymphoblastoid cells. proportion ebna-positive cells
corresponded lymphoblastoid cells, reached 50% 4 days. ebna 
was present cells b-cell markers. observations indicate that
only b-cells susceptible ebv infection, transformation occurs
within days ebna valid early marker susceptibility ebv
transformation.
