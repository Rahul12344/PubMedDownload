two g12 human rotavirus strains, cp727 cp1030, isolated the
respective diarrheic stools infant adult japan. vp7 gene
sequences strains cp727 cp1030 showed high identity g12
prototype strain l26, g12 strains reported recently from
thailand, united states, india. vp4 gene sequences strains cp727 and
cp1030 showed highest identity p[9] rotaviruses. northern
blot hybridization, strains cp727 cp1030 found closely related 
strain au-1 (g3p[9]); nine rna segments hybridized other. moreover, all
segments two japanese g12 strains hybridized thai g12
strain t152. results suggest japanese g12 strains detected this
study reassortants l26-like strain strain au-1
genogroup. similar reassortant found thai g12 strain t152.
