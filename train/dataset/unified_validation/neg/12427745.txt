the tumor suppressor p53 required maintenance genomic integrity
following dna damage. one mechanism p53 functions induce block
in transition g(1) phase cell cycle. previous
studies indicate kr√ºppel-like factor 4 (klf4) gene activated
following dna damage activation depends p53. addition,
enforced expression klf4 causes g(1)/s arrest. present study examines 
requirement klf4 mediating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest process in
response dna damage. show g(1) population colon cancer cell
line, hct116, null p53 alleles (-/-) abolished following
gamma irradiation compared cells wild-type p53 (+/+). conditional
expression klf4 irradiated hct116 p53-/- cells restored g(1) cell
population level similar seen irradiated hct116 p53+/+ cells.
conversely, treatment hct116 p53+/+ cells small interfering rna (sirna)
specific klf4 significantly reduced number cells g(1) phase
following gamma irradiation compared untreated control treated 
with nonspecific sirna. case increase decrease klf4 level
because conditional induction sirna inhibition, respectively, was
accompanied increase decrease level p21(waf1/cip1). results of
our study indicate klf4 essential mediator p53 controlling
g(1)/s progression cell cycle following dna damage.
