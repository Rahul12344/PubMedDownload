complementary dnas covering entire rna genome soybean dwarf luteovirus
(sdv) cloned sequenced. computer analysis 5861 nucleotide
sequence revealed five major open reading frames (orfs) possessing conservation
of sequence organisation known luteovirus sequences. comparative
analyses genome structure show sdv shares sequence homology and
features gene organisation barley yellow dwarf virus (pav isolate) the
5' half genome, yet closely related potato leafroll virus in
its 3' coding regions. addition, sdv differs known luteoviruses 
possessing exceptionally long 3' terminal sequence apparent coding
capacity. conclude data sdv genome represents third
variant genome type luteovirus group.
