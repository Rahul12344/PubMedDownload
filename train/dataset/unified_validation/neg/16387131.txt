background: recurrent hepatitis c virus (hcv) often treated interferon
and ribavirin combination therapy results disappointing. given 
promising results reported pegylated interferon ribavirin hepatitis 
c, combination preferred treatment recurrent hcv. this
article reports transplantation program's experience antiviral therapy
treatment liver transplant recipients recurrent hcv.
methods: october 2002 june 2004, patients recurrent hcv were
screened determine eligible treatment. liver function tests, 
hcvrna, liver biopsies done patients prior treatment. hcvrna
was repeated 3 months, end treatment (eot), 6 months eot for
patients hcvrna-negative eot. patients prospectively followed after
starting weekly pegylated interferon alfa-2a 180 mcg/wk ribavirin 1000-1200
mg/d (roche, nutley, nj, united states) folic acid 1 mg/d.
results: thirty-two patients eligible treatment median age of
49.2 years. twenty-one patients completed treatment, 6 remain treatment, 
and 5 intolerant. intention-to-treat analysis, sustained hcvrna
eradication occurred least 40.6% patients. side effects led treatment
withdrawal 5 patients (15.6%).
conclusion: pegylated interferon alfa-2a ribavirin appear promising the
treatment recurrent hcv. side effects infrequent cause treatment
discontinuation, unlike previous combinations interferon-based therapy.
randomized, prospective trials incorporating serial liver biopsies with
appropriate quality life analyses required manage silent epidemic.
