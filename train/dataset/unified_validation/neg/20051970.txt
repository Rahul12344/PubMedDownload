hepatitis caused infection hepatitis virus (hdv) is
considered severe form viral hepatitis humans. hepatitis d
occurs individuals positive hbv surface antigen (hbsag) hdv is
a defective rna viroid requires hbsag transmission. least eight
different hdv genotypes described characteristic
geographic distribution distinct clinical course. hdv hbv coinfection
can associated complex dynamic viral dominance patterns. chronic hdv 
infection leads severe liver disease hbv monoinfection is
associated accelerated fibrosis progression, earlier hepatic decompensation 
and increased risk development hepatocellular carcinoma. far,
only ifn-alpha treatment proven antiviral activity hdv humans 
has linked improved long-term outcomes. studies conducted past 2
years use peg-ifn-alpha show sustained virologic response to
therapy, measured terms undetectable serum hdv rna levels, achieved 
in one quarter patients hepatitis d. novel alternative treatment
options including prenylation inhibitors awaiting clinical development for
use hepatitis d.
