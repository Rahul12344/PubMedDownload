understanding etiological role epidemiological profile needed improve
clinical management prevention acute respiratory infections (aris). a
5-year prospective study active surveillance outpatients inpatients
with aris conducted gansu province, china, january 2011 november
2015. respiratory specimens collected patients tested eight
respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). study, 2768 eligible
patients median age 43 years enrolled including pneumonia (1368,
49.2%), bronchitis (435, 15.7%), upper respiratory tract infection urti (250, 
9.0%), unclassified ari (715, 25.8%). overall, 29.2% (808/2768) positive
for one eight viruses, 130 cases identified two 
viruses. human rhinovirus (hrv) showed highest detection rate (8.6%),
followed influenza virus (flu, 7.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (rsv, 6.1%),
human coronavirus (hcov, 4.3%), human parainfluenza (piv, 4.0%), adenovirus (adv,
2.1%), human metapneumovirus (hmpv, 1.6%), human bocavirus (hbov, 0.7%).
compared urti, rsv likely identified pneumonia (χ2  = 12.720,
p < 0.001) hcov commonly associated bronchitis pneumonia
(χ2  = 15.019, p < 0.001). patients aged less 5 years, rsv showed the
highest detection rate hcov frequent virus detected adults
and elderly. clear epidemical seasons observed hrv, flu, hcov
infections. findings could serve reference local health
authorities drawing plans prevent control aris associated
with viral etiologies.
