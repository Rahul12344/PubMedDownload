to evaluate usefulness endocervical cytology immediately loop
electrosurgical excision procedure (leep) viral human papilloma virus (hpv)
determination predictive factors persistence/recurrence (p/r) squamous
intraepithelial lesion (sil) remaining cervix patients treated with
leep due cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) ii iii. we
retrospectively selected 105 samples 100 patients histologic diagnosis 
of cin ii-iii cytology immediately leep first control post-leep
between 2 6 months treatment included hpv determination, minimal
follow-up period 12 months maximum 24 months, least 2
colpocytologic controls post-leep. 71 105 patients (67.6%), the
determination negative, finding presence hpv 34 patients (32.4 %). 
almost two-thirds patients negative endocervical cytology absence 
of hpv. follow-up, 20 p/r detected, 16 (15.2%) being
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (7 cin ii 9 cin iii). the
combination endocervical cytology hpv determination remaining
cervix seems good strategy predict risk sil conization.
the probability p/r estimated based results 2
variables. negativity hpv determination together negative
endocervical cytology guarantees enough security favorable evolution.
