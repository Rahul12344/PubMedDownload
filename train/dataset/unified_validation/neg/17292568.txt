we developed validated agar gel immunodiffusion test (agid) test the
diagnosis equine infectious anemia (eia) using antigen p26 protein of
equine infectious anemia virus (eiav) produced escherichia coli expression
system. developed rp26-agid test showed excellent diagnostic relative
sensitivity (100%) specificity (100%) compared commercial agid assay
when 1855 field serum samples analyzed. addition, rp26-agid
demonstrated precise assay excellent repeatability and
reproducibility. analytical sensitivity trial, positive sera showed nearly
the endpoint dilutions compared tests. positive-reactions were
observed 35 serum samples antibodies related endemic agents
and also severely hemolysed samples, demonstrating rp26-agid an
excellent analytical specificity. complete concordance blind previous
results five proficiency test panels confirmed capability assay
of accurate detection eiav antibodies. first time a
recombinant agid assay able identify eiav infections standardized and
validated argentina according international guidelines. taking account
the results obtained, p26-agid could adopted official test method
for diagnosis control eia country.
