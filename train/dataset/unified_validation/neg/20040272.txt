the artificial antigen-presenting cells (aapcs) described review were
generated facilitate production virus-specific t-cells the
treatment infections patients bone marrow transplant. aapcs
consist murine 3t3 cells genetically modified express critical human
molecules needed t-cell stimulation, co-stimulatory molecules
b7.1, icam-1, lfa-3 one series 6 common hla class alleles. when
t-cells sensitized cytomegalovirus (cmv) using aapcs express 
shared hla allele using autologous antigen-presenting cells (apcs) loaded with
the cmvpp65 antigen, activated expanded become hla-restricted
cmvpp65-specific t-cells. t-cells demonstrated functional activity vitro
against cmv producing ifn-gamma inducing cmvpp65-specific cytotoxicity.
t-cells sensitized aapcs recognized antigenic epitopes presented hla
allele known immunogenic man. sensitization aapcs also permitted
expansion ifn-gamma+ cytotoxic t-cells subdominant epitopes 
not effectively recognized t-cells sensitized autologous apcs. panel
of aapcs provides source immediately accessible, standardizable, and
replenishable "off shelf" cellular reagents potential make
adoptive immunotherapy widely available treatment lethal infections,
cancer, autoimmune diseases.
