experiments monoclonal antibodies raised two laboratory strains of
sindbis virus, sb sin, suggested existence strain-specific
neutralizing antigenic site (e2-b) e2 glycoprotein. comparison of
monoclonal antibody binding patterns e2 glycoprotein gene sequences six
laboratory strains distinguished three different configurations e2-b that
correlated specific amino acid substitutions position 216 e2
glycoprotein. study neutralization escape mutants selected with
e2-b-specific antibodies confirmed amino acid 216 major determinant 
the e2-b antigenic site. eight nine mutants showed coding change position
216. one neutralization escape mutation created new glycosylation site at
position 213 resulted e2 protein altered migration rate in
sds-page. neutralization escape mutants studied included amino acid
substitutions found laboratory strains revealed differing binding
requirements two e2-b-specific monoclonal antibodies. e2-b site is
contrasted e2-c neutralizing antigenic site described previously (r.a.
olmsted, w.j. meyer, r.e. johnston, 1986, virology 148, 245-254).
