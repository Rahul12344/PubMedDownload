a series protocols tested examine adjuvant effects il-12 on
humoral type 1 cytokine responses elicited mice recombinant gp120
envelope protein hiv-1. ag fails induce detectable ab responses when
administered s.c. alone, stimulates low ab levels combined aluminum
hydroxide (alum). moreover, i.p. injected ril-12 included the
immunization, increase ab production observed. importantly, optimal
gp120 ab responses achieved immunizing mice s.c. gp120 ril-12
simultaneously coadsorbed alum. animals displayed highly polarized,
type 1 cytokine profile, emergence anti-gp120 ig belonging the
igg2 igg3 isotypes. addition, major increase occurred ab igg1 
subclass. superior adjuvant activity alum-adsorbed il-12 compared with
that free cytokine correlated prolonged detection ifn-gamma in
the sera animals immunized using former procedure. related experiments,
in vitro neutralization il-12 shown inhibit ifn-gamma production by
spleen cells mice immunized gp120 plus alum, splenocytes
from mice primed presence il-12, suggesting latter protocol
induces stable type 1 phenotype. studies demonstrate presentation of
il-12 alum enhances immunomodulatory effects establish protocol 
the use cytokine adjuvant simultaneously promoting humoral 
ab type 1 cytokine responses.
