gene therapy vectors based adeno-associated virus-2 (aav2) offer considerable 
promise human gene therapy. applications aav vectors limited to
tissues efficiently transduced vector due natural tropism, is
predominantly skeletal muscle, neurons, hepatocytes. tropism modification 
elevate efficiency and/or selectivity individual cell types would enhance 
scope aav disease therapies. vascular endothelium implicitly
important cardiovascular diseases cancer, relatively poorly
transduced aav vectors. therefore genetically incorporated peptide
sigyplp, targets endothelial cells (ec), position i-587 aav
capsids. sigyplp-modified aav (aavsig) showed enhanced transduction human ec
compared aav wild-type capsid (aavwt), phenotype independent of
heparan sulphate proteoglycan (hspg) binding. contrast, aavsig enhance
transduction primary human vascular smooth muscle cells human hepatocytes, 
principal targets aav vectors local systemic gene delivery
applications, respectively. furthermore, infection ec presence of
bafilomycin a(2) indicated intracellular trafficking aav particles was
altered targeting aav means sigyplp. aav vectors enhanced tropism
for ec useful diverse gene therapeutics targeted vasculature.
