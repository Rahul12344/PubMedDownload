kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) orf57, also known mta (mrna
transcript accumulation), enhances viral intron-less transcript accumulation 
promotes splicing intron-containing viral rna transcripts. study, we
identified kshv pan, long non-coding polyadenylated nuclear rna main
target orf57 genome-wide clip (cross-linking immunoprecipitation)
approach. kshv genome lacking orf57 expresses minimal amount pan. in
cotransfection experiments, orf57 alone increased pan expression 20-30-fold
when compared vector control. accumulation function orf57 was
dependent structured rna element 5' pan, named mre (mta responsive
element), much ene (expression nuclear retention element) in
the 3' pan previously reported studies. showed major
function 5' pan mre increasing rna half-life pan presence
of orf57. mutational analyses revealed core motif consisting 9
nucleotides mre-ii , responsible orf57 interaction and
function. 9-nt core mre-ii also binds cellular pabpc1, the
e1b-ap5 binds another region mre-ii. addition, found pan 
rna partially exportable presence orf57. together, data provide 
compelling evidence orf57 functions accumulate non-coding viral
rna course virus lytic infection.
