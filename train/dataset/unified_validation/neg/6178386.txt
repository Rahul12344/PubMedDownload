rat hybridoma antibodies canine parvovirus.

burtonboy g, bazin h, delferriere n.

hybrid cells produced fusion rat myeloma cells ir983f and
spleen cells lou rat immunized canine enteritis parvovirus. four
stable cell lines selected secreting monoclonal antibody directed
against virus. indirect immunofluorescence, antigenic determinants
recognized antibodies found present canine
parvovirus infected cells also cells infected related parvoviruses 
of mink enteritis feline panleukopenia. two monoclonal antibodies
inhibit hemagglutination canine virus neutralize infectivity.
hybrid cells transplanted histocompatible animals, large amounts of
the antibodies obtained.
