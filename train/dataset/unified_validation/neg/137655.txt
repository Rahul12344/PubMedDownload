the normal subtentorial brain cells newborn mice (c3h/bifb/ki) cultured
by monolayer culture technique. first subculture inoculated with
human adenovirus type 12 (ad 12) attempt achieve transformation of
the brain cells. normal cultured cells morphologically divided into
astrocytic cells (ac-1 cells ac-2 cells), immature brain cells including
undifferentiated cells (ud cells) glioblastic cells (gb cells), and
fibroblastic cells (fb cells). fluorescent t-antigen first appeared type
of cells gradually decreased. later, fluorescent t-antigen remained mainly in
the immature brain cells (gb cells) grew clusters epithelioid
areas astrocytic cells. 21 days ad 12 infection, transformed foci
appeared epithelioid areas. morphologically, transformed cells
resembled immature brain cells, especially gb cells, vitro. often showed 
rosette-like structures, cystic spaces trabecular patterns the
subcultures. tumors developed transplantation the
transformed cells subcutaneous tissue brain mice quite similar
to original brain tumors induced ad 12. findings strongly
suggested that, vitro, target cells ad 12 subtentorial tissues
of mouse brain immature brain cells, probably gb cells.
