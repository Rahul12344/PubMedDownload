rift valley fever virus (rvfv) causes outbreaks severe disease domestic
ungulates well humans africa. logical concern rvfv could
be introduced americas cause significant health economic damage 
based precedent introduction spread west nile virus (wnv).
unfortunately, currently licensed diagnostic assays available for
rvfv americas. work, report ability novel dipstick 
assay, vectortest rvfv antigen assay, modeled vectest assay wnv, to
detect rvfv-infected female within pool mosquitoes. dipsticks provided
results <20 min, easy use, require laboratory with
containment facilities. although readily able detect mosquito a
disseminated rvfv infection, occasionally detected rvfv mosquito
with nondisseminated infection, therefore may fail detect pools
that actually contain one positive mosquitoes. rvfv dipstick assay
was highly specific react samples added yellow
fever, west nile, venezuelan equine encephalitis, sandfly fever naples, sandfly
fever sicilian, sandfly fever toscana viruses. rvfv assay provide a
rapid, safe, easy-to-use assay alert public health personnel presence
of rvfv mosquitoes. results assay allow rapid threat
assessment focusing vector control measures high-risk areas.
