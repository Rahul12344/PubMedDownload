the effect micromolar concentrations delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(delta-9-thc) vitro replication biosynthesis herpes simplex
virus type 2 (hsv2) determined. 100-fold increase extracellular virus
was recorded infected vero cells pretreated 10(-6) 10(-5) drug
when compared infected vehicle-treated controls. however, significant
differences observed production total infectious virus 
the vehicle drug-treated cultures. immunofluorescence virus-infected cells 
revealed delta-9-thc alter intracellular compartmentalization of
virus-specified proteins. analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis autoradiography isotopically labeled, cell-associated
virus-specified proteins revealed delta-9-thc major effect the
production early nonstructural proteins decreased synthesis late
structural proteins. scanning electron microscopy light microscopy revealed
blebs surface macrovacuoles cytoplasm infected and
uninfected cells treated drug. results suggest delta-9-thc at
micromolar concentrations selectively targets host cell consequence 
of perturbation cellular membranes. alteration cellular membranes may
account enhanced virus release decreased expression of
virus-specified, cell-associated late structural proteins.
