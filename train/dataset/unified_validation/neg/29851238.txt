background: emergency department (ed) visits provide opportunity hepatitis
c virus (hcv) screening patients otherwise might tested. report
on novel nontargeted, opt-out hcv screening linkage-to-care (ltc) program
implemented urban ed.
methods: descriptive analysis 3 months (november 2016-january
2017) nontargeted, opt-out ed hcv screening ltc program among patients
at least 13 years old undergoing phlebotomy clinical purposes. multipurpose
best practice advisory (bpa) alerted providers program generated order
labels. patients authorized testing, specimens drawn ed for
hcv antibody (ab) reflex confirmatory rna tests. public health navigators
attempted contact rna-positive patients arrange outpatient visits.
results: hcv ab tests performed 3,808 patients, 6,950% increase from
preprogram. proportion hcv ab test positivity 13.2% (504/3,808, 95%
confidence interval [ci] = 12.2%-14.3%) 97.8% (493/504) a
follow-up rna test performed. total 292 confirmed positive active
infection, overall rna positivity rate 7.7% (95% ci = 6.8%-8.5%). of
those active infection, 155 (53%) outside centers disease
control prevention birth cohort increased risk hcv including 46
(15.8%, 95% ci = 11.8%-20.4%) also report injection drug use. linkage
attempts documented 223 (76.4%) patients appointments scheduled 
for 102 (38% attempted). sixty-six patients attended ltc visit (22.5% of
all rna-positive patients, 30% linkage-eligible patients).
conclusions: nontargeted opt-out hcv testing successfully implemented in
an ed setting. number patients diagnosed outside traditional risk
groups. diagnosed, ed population may difficult engage care, 
a structured interdisciplinary program successfully link patients hcv
care.
