previously, mutational analyses dna binding domain bovine
papillomavirus e1 protein (e1dbd) identified several hydrophobic residues that
are critical dna binding activity (m. west, d. flanery, k. woytek, d.
rangasamy, v. g. wilson, 2001, j. virol. 75, 11948-11960). hydrophobic
interactions nonpolar amino acid side chains contribute function of
dna binding proteins conformational effects direct interaction
with nucleotides. investigate role hydrophobic residues in
e1dbd function, extensive site-directed mutational analysis hydrophobic
amino acids conducted. alanine substitutions made residues v196,
f197, f217, f, 237, v246, l249, f276, mutants tested dna
binding activity vitro vivo. e1 f237a f276a mutants were
completely defective site-specific dna binding, mutants
retained partial full wild-type binding activity. consistent dna
binding defect, f237a f276a mutants severely impaired the
ability support transient vivo replication origin plasmid. combined
with previous study, five critical hydrophobic residues identified:
f175, v193, f237, v246, f276. five residues localize two internal
clusters e1dbd structure designated hydrophobic clusters (hca; includes 
f175, v193, f276) b (hcb; includes f237 v246). amino acid side chains
from residues hca hcb little surface accessibility unlikely
that involved direct contact dna. hca distal dna
binding surface presumably contributes global conformational organization 
of e1dbd. hcb positioned beneath dna contact surface propose
that serves anchor platform device stabilize dna-binding
element. comparable hydrophobic cluster present corresponding
position antigen dbd likely serves similar function.
