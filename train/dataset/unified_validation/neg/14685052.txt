background: hla-b57, well cytotoxic t-lymphocyte (ctl) responses restricted
by allele, strongly associated long-term non-progressive
chronic hiv-1 infection. however, impact viral replication acute 
hiv-1 infection known.
methods: clinical immunological parameters acute early hiv-1
infection individuals expressing hla-b57 assessed. hiv-1-specific t-cell 
responses determined peptide-specific interferon-gamma production
measured using elispot assay flow-based intracellular cytokine
quantification.
results: individuals expressing hla-b57 presented significantly less frequently
with symptomatic acute hiv-1 infection (4/116, 3.4%) expected the
frequency chronically infected individuals expressing allele (43/446,
9.6%; p < 0.05). acute infection, virus-specific cd8 t-cell responses were
dominated hla-b57-restricted responses, significantly broader (p < 0.02) 
and stronger (p < 0.03) responses restricted hla-b57 restricted all
other co-expressed hla class alleles combined. six nine individuals
expressing hla-b57 controlled hiv-1 viremia absence therapy levels <
5000 copies/ml (median, 515 copies/ml) 29 months following acute
infection.
conclusion: data demonstrate host genetic factors influence the
clinical manifestations acute hiv-1 infection provide functional link
between hla-b57 viral immune control.
