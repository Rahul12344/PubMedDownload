background: rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) highly virulent
calicivirus, first described domestic rabbits china 1984. rhdv appears
to mutant form benign virus existed europe long the
first outbreak. iberian peninsula, first epidemic 1988 severely
reduced populations autochthonous european wild rabbit. examine the
evolutionary history rhdv iberian peninsula, collected virus samples
from wild rabbits sequenced fragment capsid protein gene vp60. these
data together available sequences western european countries,
were analyzed following bayesian markov chain monte carlo methods infer 
phylogenetic relationships, evolutionary rates demographic history.
results: evolutionary relationships rhdv revealed three main lineages with
significant phylogeographic structure. lineages seem emerged a
common period time, ~1875 ~1976. iberian peninsula showed
evidences genetic isolation, probably due geographic barriers gene flow,
and also region youngest mrca.overall, demographic analyses
showed initial increase stabilization relative genetic diversity of
rhdv, subsequent reduction genetic diversity first epidemic
breakout 1984, compatible decline effective population
size.
conclusions: results consistent hypothesis current iberian
rhdv arose single infection 1869 1955 (95% hpd), rendered 
a temporal pattern appearance extinction lineages. propose 
rising positive selection pressure observed throughout history rhdv is
likely mediated host immune system consequence genetic changes
that rendered virus virulent. consequently, relationship suggested to
condition rhdv demographic history.
