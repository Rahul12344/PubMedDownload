intracranial injection viral vectors engineered express fluorescent
protein versatile labeling technique visualization specific subsets
of cells different brain regions vivo brain sections. unlike
the injection fluorescent dyes, viral labeling offers targeting individual 
cell types less expensive time consuming establishing transgenic 
mouse lines. technique, adeno-associated viral (aav) vector is
injected intracranially using stereotaxic coordinates, micropipette an
automated pump precise delivery aav desired area minimal
damage surrounding tissue. injection parameters tailored to
individual experiments adjusting animal age injection, injection
location, volume injection, rate injection, aav serotype promoter
driving gene expression. depending conditions chosen, virally-induced
transgene expression allow visualization groups cells, individual cells
or fine cellular processes, level dendritic spines. experiment
shown depicts injection double-stranded aav expressing green
fluorescent protein labeling neurons glia mouse primary
visual cortex.
