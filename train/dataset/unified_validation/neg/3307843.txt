sublethal doses whole-body irradiation induced elevation zinc
protoporphyrin (zpp). experiments conducted determine recovery from
radiomimetic drugs also resulted elevation zpp. daily injections with
hydroxyurea cytotoxic drugs 10 days caused zpp elevation dose
of radiation low cause zpp elevation caused zpp elevation when
hydroxyurea administered prior irradiation. friend leukemia virus also
brought elevation zpp. however, factors increased
erythropoiesis brought zpp elevation. elevated erythropoiesis in
response hypoxia enhanced erythropoiesis followed administration 
of folic acid folic acid-deficient mice accompanied zpp elevation.
