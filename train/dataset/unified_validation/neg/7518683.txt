epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection associated production of
autoantibodies. n-terminal 35-58 sequence ebna i, one nuclear
antigens encoded ebv, highly homologous c-terminal 95-119 region 
the ribonucleoprotein smd. autoantibodies specific smd present in
systemic lupus (sle) sera therefore considered serological marker of
sle. measured antibodies ebna 35-58 sequence ebv-related diseases 
and autoimmune disorders. antibodies ebna 35-58 peptide present 
in 30% normal sera, 12% burkitt lymphoma, 22% infectious mononucleosis, 25%
rheumatoid arthritis, 38% sle 33% sjogren's syndrome. antibodies smd
95-119 peptide detectable 32% sle sera, 17% infectious mononucleosis
and 12% burkitt lymphoma. specificity anti-ebna 35-58 antibodies
affinity-purified nine sera analysed means inhibition assay.
only anti-ebna 35-58 antibodies affinity-purified sle sera similar 
affinity viral peptide smd c-terminal one; also bind the
recombinant smd western blot. results indicate antibodies ebna i
35-58 produced normals, ebv-related diseases autoimmune
disorder, sle sera contain anti-viral antibodies cross-reactive 
autoantigen.
