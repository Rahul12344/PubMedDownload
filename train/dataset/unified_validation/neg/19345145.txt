background: procedures prevent severe graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) delay
immune reconstitution secondary transplants haploidentical haemopoietic
stem cells treatment leukaemia, leading high rates late
infectious mortality. aimed systematically add back genetically engineered 
donor lymphocytes facilitate immune reconstitution prevent late mortality.
methods: phase i-ii, multicentre, non-randomised trial haploidentical
stem-cell transplantation, infused donor lymphocytes expressing herpes-simplex
thymidine kinase suicide gene (tk-cells) transplantation. primary study
endpoint immune reconstitution defined circulating cd3+ count 100 cells
per mul two consecutive observations. analysis intention to
treat. trial registered clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00423124.
findings: aug 13, 2002, march 26, 2008, 50 patients (median age 51 years,
range 17-66) received haploidentical stem-cell transplants high-risk
leukaemia. immune reconstitution recorded infusion tk-cells. 28
patients received tk-cells starting 28 days transplantation; 22 patients
obtained immune reconstitution median 75 days (range 34-127) from
transplantation 23 days (13-42) infusion. ten patients developed acute
gvhd (grade i-iv) one developed chronic gvhd, controlled by
induction suicide gene. overall survival 3 years 49% (95% ci 25-73)
for 19 patients remission primary leukaemia time of
stem-cell transplantation. tk-cell infusion, last death due to
infection 166 days, infectious death 100
days. acute chronic adverse events related gene-transfer
procedure.
interpretation: infusion tk-cells might effective accelerating immune
reconstitution, controlling gvhd protecting patients late
mortality candidates haploidentical stem-cell
transplantation.
