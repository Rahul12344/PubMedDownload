human enteroviruses (hev) (picornaviridae) considered one major viral 
causes childhood acute respiratory wheezing illnesses including bronchiolitis 
and asthma exacerbation. identify mechanisms regulate the
development airway mucosa inflammation hev respiratory lower tract
infection, investigated profile levels mrna protein
secretion cc cxc human chemokines hev-infected primary human bronchial
epithelial cells (sae cells) using rt-pcr array bio-plex assay. cultures of
sae cells infected reference wild-type hev respiratory strains,
demonstrating replicative productive viral infection. observed 
replicative infection sae cells reference wild-type hev strains
induced specific dose time-dependent increases mrna protein secretion

tested. protein secretion chemokines appeared significantly
increased 48 72h post-infection cultures treated low-doses of
ifn-gamma comparatively mock-infected cells (p<0.001), correlated to
the viral replication activity. conclusion, findings demonstrated a
