oxysterols known pleiotropic molecules whose antiviral action been
recently discovered. reported activity panel oxysterols
against hsv-1 identification new mechanism action. marked
antiviral activity 25hc also 27hc hsv-1 observed
either oxysterols added infection, suggesting an
activity unrelated viral entry inhibition proposed previous
literature. therefore, relation pro-inflammatory activity of
oxysterols activation nf-kb il-6 induced hsv-1 host cell
was investigated. indeed, cell pre-incubation oxysterols potentiated
il-6 production induced hsv-1 infection consequent boost the
interleukin's total cell secretion. further, direct antiviral effect il-6
administration hsv-1 infected cells demonstrated, disclosing additional
mechanism antiviral action 25hc 27hc.
