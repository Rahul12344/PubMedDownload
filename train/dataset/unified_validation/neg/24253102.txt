pr39 angiogenic masterswitch protein, belonging second generation of
angiogenic growth factors. however, role recombinant adeno-associated
virus (aav) carrying pr39 fusion gene (aav-pr39) acute myocardial
infarction remains unclear. therefore, study, investigated role of
aav-pr39 experimental animal model acute myocardial infarction. pr39
gene fused transmembrane peptide, tat, 6xhis‑tag nt4 signal
sequences. aav-pr39 obtained calcium phosphate co-precipitation. a
total 18 healthy chinese mini pigs randomly divided experimental 
groups (the aav-pr39-treated group) control group [phosphated-buffered
saline (pbs)-treated group]. following induction myocardial infarction,
enhanced 3.0t mr imaging performed observe changes myocardial
signal intensity 0 h, 1, 2 3 weeks. expression hypoxia-inducible
factor‑1α (hif-1α) myocardial tissues determined sabc
immunohistochemistry. addition, vitro experiments using crl-1730
endothelial cells transfected aav vector containing nt4-tat-his-pr39
revealed aav-pr39-treated group significantly higher expression of
hif-1α compared control group. moreover, pr39 regulated the
hif-1α-induced expression angiogenic growth factors. hypoxic conditions,
the anti-apoptotic effects aav-pr39 group pronounced 
observed control (pbs-treated) group. vivo, enforced expression 
recombinant pr39 elevated level hif-1α hypoxic conditions and
decreased size infarcted areas upregulating expression of
hif-1α areas surrounding infarct area. taken together, data
demonstrate recombinant aav-pr39-mediated hif-1α expression attenuates
myocardial infarction, indicating aav-pr39 may serve novel therapeutic 
agent treatment myocardial infarction.
