the binding ci-repressor series mutant operators containing or1 the
right operator bacteriophage lambda investigated. sites or2 and/or or3
were inactivated either point deletion mutations. free energy of
binding repressor or1 wildtype operator, delta g1, -13.7 +/- 0.3
kcal/mol. delta g1 determined or2- operator created single point
mutation or2 -13.6 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol. contrast, delta g1 binding 
of repressor cloned synthetic or1 operator containing 24 bp lambda
sequence -12.2 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol. sequence 5' or1 present, the
binding affinity increases -13.0 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol. addition, proximity 
of or1 fragment-end decreases delta g1 -13.7 -12.3 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol.
these results suggest dna sequence outside 17 bp or1 binding-site
contributes specific binding ci-repressor.
