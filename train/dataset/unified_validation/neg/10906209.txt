canine distemper virus (cdv) causes life-threatening disease several
carnivores including domestic dogs. recently, identified molecule, cd9, a
member tetraspan transmembrane protein family, facilitates, and
antibodies inhibit, infection tissue culture cells cdv
(strain onderstepoort). describe anti-cd9 monoclonal antibody
(mab k41) interfere binding cdv cells uptake virus. 
addition, single-step growth experiments, mab k41 induce differences
in levels viral mrna proteins. however, virus release of
syncytium-forming strains cdv, virus-induced cell-cell fusion lytically
infected cultures, cell-cell fusion uninfected persistently
cdv-infected hela cells strongly inhibited mab k41. data indicate
that anti-cd9 antibodies selectively block virus-induced cell-cell fusion,
whereas virus-cell fusion affected.
