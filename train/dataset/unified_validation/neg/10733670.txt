investigated three nonviral transfection systems gene transfer cultured
human keratinocytes organotypic cultures. superfect highly branched
polycationic transfection reagent, primefector polycationic liposome compound, 
and avet (adenovirus-enhanced transferrin-mediated) system consists a
ternary complex biotinylated chemically inactivated adenovirus noncovalently
complexed plasmid dna polylysine-transferrin. avet transfection of
cultured keratinocytes pcibetagal, cmv/beta-galactosidase reporter
plasmid, 28.8% +/- 1.4% cells stained blue. superfect about
2-fold less efficient, whereas primefector transfect keratinocytes.
similar results obtained transfection efficiencies measured by
enzyme assays. addition holotransferrin culture medium replacement
of polylysine-transferrin polylysine ternary complex affect the
transfection efficiency. using avet complexes without adenovirus, however,
strongly diminished gene delivery. indicates avet complex taken 
up adenovirus receptor. separation avet/pcibetagal transfected
keratinocytes adhesion collagen iv two fractions (rapidly slowly
adhering cells) showed latter transfected 3-fold higher level.
therefore, seems putative stem cells adhering rapidly collagen iv 
not efficiently transfected avet. avet-transfected keratinocytes derived 
keratinocyte trans- glutaminase negative lamellar ichthyosis patients a
cmv-tgk expression plasmid showed possible reach level total
enzyme activity similar found cultured keratinocytes normal
individuals. organotypic cultures outer root sheath cells avet
transfection successful, might due presence the
cornified layer inaccessibility adenovirus receptor. summary, the
avet system provides powerful tool transient vitro transfection of
keratinocytes.
