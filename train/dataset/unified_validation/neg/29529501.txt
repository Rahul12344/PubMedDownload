hiv infection still serious health socio-economical impact one
of primary causes morbidity mortality world. hiv
infection aids pandemic still matters great concern, especially in
less developed countries access highly active antiretroviral therapy
(haart) limited. patient compliance another serious drawback. nowadays,
haart treatment choice although panacea. despite fact
that suppresses viral replication undetectable viral loads prevents
progression hiv infection aids haart several pitfalls, namely,
long-term side-effects, drug resistance development, emergence drug-resistant 
viruses, low compliance intolerance patients drugs.
moreover, another serious health concern event co-infection more
than one pathogen time (e.g. hiv hcv, hbv, herpes viruses, etc). 
currently, multi-target drug approach become exciting strategy to
address complex diseases overcome drug resistance development. such
multifunctional molecules combine structure pharmacophores may
simultaneously interfere multiple targets use may eventually be
more safe efficacious involving mixture separate molecules
because avoidance delay drug resistance, lower incidence unwanted
drug-drug interactions improved compliance. review focus on
multifunctional molecules dual activity different targets hiv
life cycle able block replication, hiv also other
viruses often co-pathogens hiv. different approaches are
documented selected examples.
