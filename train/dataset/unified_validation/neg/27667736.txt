the aim study assess immune response parainfluenza virus
type 3 (piv3), rhinovirus 1b (rv1b) intracellular toll-like receptors (tlr)
agonists nasal epithelial cells (necs) patients allergic rhinitis
and healthy controls. necs obtained eight patients allergic
rhinitis (ar) 11 non-atopic healthy controls (hc) nasal scraping, grown to
confluence exposed piv3, rv1b infection tlr-3 tlr-7/8 agonists.
interferon (ifn)-λ1, ifn-α, ifn-β regulated activation, normal expressed
and secreted (rantes) release cell culture supernatants assessed 
8, 24 48 h upon infection 8 24 h stimulation poly(i:c) 
r848. mrna levels ifns, rantes, interferon regulatory transcription factor
(irf)3, irf7 viral gene copy number determined using real-time
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). piv3 rv1b replication 48 h after
infection significantly lower (p < 0·01) necs ar patients compared to
hc. piv3 infection induced significantly less ifn-λ1 (both protein mrna) in
necs ar compared hc. ifn-β mrna expression rantes protein release and
mrna expression tended smaller ar compared hc cells response 
viruses. stimulation tlr-3 agonist [poly (i:c)] induced similar ifn-λ1 and
rantes generation ar hc subjects. viral infections necs induced irf7
expression, correlated ifn rantes expression. data suggest
that virus proliferation rates immune response profile different in
nasal epithelial cells patients allergic rhinitis compared healthy
individuals.
