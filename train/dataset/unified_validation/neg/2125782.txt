of 110 thalassemic patients 184 normal individuals matched age and
socioeconomic status study subjects. mean age (+/- sd) both
patients control subjects 31.1 +/- 13.5 years. hbv infection occurred
in 51.6% household contacts 32.1% control subjects. this
difference highly significant (p less 0.001). frequent marker
observed antihepatitis b core igg followed antihepatitis b surface
antibody. noteworthy none thalassemic patients infected 
past seropositive hepatitis b surface antigen time the
study, whereas frequency general population 8.1%. findings
indicate household contacts thalassemic patients greater
seroprevalence hepatitis b infection. furthermore, household contacts 
thalassemic patients infected younger age control population.
the high infection rate hbv groups tested suggests vaccination
