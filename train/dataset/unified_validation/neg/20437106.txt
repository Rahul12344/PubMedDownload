human t-lymphotrophic virus type (htlv-i) oncogenic retrovirus its
infection associated variety human diseases including
htlv-i-associated myelopathy/tropic spastic paraparesis (ham/tsp). large numbers 
of epidemiological, virological, immunological, clinical studies htlv-i-
and htlv-i-associated diseases published, although pathogenesis 
ham/tsp remains fully understood. last several years, researchers
have shown several key factors important htlv-i-associated neurologic
disease including high htlv-i proviral load strong immune response to
htlv-i. here, review pathophysiological findings ham/tsp focus on
viral-host immune responses virus htlv-i infected individuals. in
particular, role htlv-i-specific cd8+ cell response highlighted.
