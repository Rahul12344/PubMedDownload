the bglg protein transcriptional antiterminator acting within the
beta-glucoside operon escherichia coli binding specific sequence motif
in growing mrna. binding bglg prevents formation terminator
stem-loop structure, thereby causing rna polymerase continue
transcription. activity bglg modulated complex way antagonistically
acting phosphorylations response availability beta-glucosidic
substrates catabolic state cell. enzymes responsible for
these phosphorylations members phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate
phosphotransferase system (pts) represents central carbohydrate uptake and
signal transduction system. enzymes believed form
higher-order complexes associated cytoplasmic membrane, tested
whether bglg would remain active artificially anchored its
presumptive site regulation, inner membrane. show the
membrane-anchored protein indeed efficiently catalyzes transcriptional
antitermination. moreover, membrane-attached bglg remains regulated the
pts. thus, membrane-bound regulatory rna binding protein potentially
interact fast enough target within nascent transcript cause 
transcriptional machinery proceed, transcriptional termination would
occur. consequently, principal necessity rna-binding
transcriptional regulator like bglg leave inner membrane, potential
regulatory site, migrate site transcription, nucleoid.
