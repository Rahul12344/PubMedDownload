a new sulfolobus islandicus strain, rey15/4, harboured novel fusellovirus,
ssv2, small plasmid, pssvx. plasmid spread s. solfataricus p1
together virus infection either supernatant culture 
of rey15/4 purified virus. spreading plasmid required co-transfection
with either ssv2 related ssv1 helpers. virus purified rey15/4
constituted mixture two sizes particles, one dimensions a
normal fusellovirus smaller. cloned ssv2 produced larger
particles ssv2 dna, indicating smaller particles contained
pssvx packaged capsids made ssv2 components. 5.7 kb genome of
pssvx revealed regions high sequence similarity cryptic sulfolobales
plasmids prn1, prn2 pdl10. thus, pssvx belongs family prn plasmids 
that share highly conserved region, probably constitutes minimal
replicon. also contain variable region showing sequence similarity. 
pssvx, region contains three open reading frames (orfs), two are
juxtapositioned show high sequence similarity tandem orfs in
fusellovirus genomes. neither prn1 prn2, lack tandem, spread in
the presence fuselloviruses, implies sequences these
orfs enable pssvx use packaging system viral helpers spreading.
