the fusion paramyxovirus cell membrane mediated fusion protein (f
protein) present virus envelope, undergoes dramatic conformational
change process. unlike hemagglutinin orthomyxovirus, change is
not mediated alteration environmental ph, cause remains unknown.
steered molecular dynamics analysis leads us suggest conformational
modification mediated stretching mechanical forces the
transmembrane fusion peptide protein anchored cell membrane.
such elongating forces generate major secondary structure rearrangement in
the heptad repeat region f protein; β-sheet conformation an
elongated coil spontaneously α-helix. addition, proposed 
that heptad repeat region adopts final three-helix coiled coil that
this structure appears formation individual helices monomer.
