the aims present study investigate effects simple and
microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic without inulin
as prebiotic meat quality broiler infected avian influenza virus (h9n2).
two hundred-day-old chicks randomly allocated 14 groups based on
simple, microencapsulated probiotic prebiotic based vaccination and
challenge h9n2 virus. groups 1-7 contained 20 chicks, groups 8-12 14
contained 10 chicks. group 13 derived group 1 10 chicks at
challenge day avian influenza virus (aiv). half groups were
vaccinated h9n2 vaccine day 5. groups except negative control and
positive vaccine control challenged 106.5 eid50 low-virulence h9n2
aiv day 21. bird received 109 cfu simple microencapsulated
probiotic days 0 17 gavage. prebiotic dose 0.1Â % feed weight
was used daily. increase water-holding capacity, dry matter, ash protein
content, decrease dripping loss plus beneficial changes lightness and
redness breast meat detected response probiotic especially
microencapsulated synbiotic. conclusion, probiotic alone prebiotic was
able improve physicochemical properties chicken breast muscle both
healthy aiv-infected chickens.
