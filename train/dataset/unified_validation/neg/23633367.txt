update of
    cochrane database syst rev. 2011;(8):cd009153.

background: antiretroviral drugs shown reduce risk of
mother-to-child transmission human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) also
widely used post-exposure prophylaxis parenteral sexual exposures.
sexual transmission may lower couples one partner infected with
hiv infected partner antiretroviral therapy
(art).
objectives: determine art use hiv-infected member an
hiv-discordant couple associated lower risk hiv transmission the
uninfected partner compared untreated discordant couples.
search methods: used standard cochrane methods search electronic databases 
and conference proceedings relevant search terms without limits language.
selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rct), cohort studies and
case-control studies hiv-discordant couples hiv-infected member
of couple treated treated art data collection and
analysis: abstracts trials identified electronic bibliographic
scanning examined independently two authors. initially identified
3,833 references examined 87 detail study eligibility. data were
abstracted independently using standardised abstraction form.
main results: one rct nine observational studies included review.
these ten studies identified 2,112 episodes hiv transmission, 1,016 among
treated couples 1,096 among untreated couples. rate ratio single 
randomised controlled trial 0.04 [95% ci 0.00, 0.27]. index partners in
this study cd4 cell counts baseline 350-550 cells/µl. similarly, the
summary rate ratio nine observational studies 0.58 [95% ci 0.35,
0.96], substantial heterogeneity (i(2)=64%). excluding two studies
with inadequate person-time data, estimated summary rate ratio 0.36 [95% 
ci 0.17, 0.75] substantial heterogeneity (i(2)=62%). also performed
subgroup analyses among observational studies see effect art 
prevention hiv differed index partner's cd4 cell count. among couples
in infected partner ≥350 cd4 cells/µl, estimated rate ratio of
0.12 [95% ci 0.01, 1.99]. subgroup, 247 transmissions in
untreated couples 30 treated couples.
authors' conclusions: art potent intervention prevention hiv in
discordant couples index partner ≤550 cd4 cells/µl. recent
multicentre rct confirms suspected benefit seen earlier observational
studies reported recent ones. questions remain durability of
protection, balance benefits adverse events associated earlier
therapy, long-term adherence transmission art-resistant strains to
partners. resource limitations implementation challenges must also be
addressed.counselling, support, follow up, well mutual disclosure, may 
have role supporting adherence, programmes designed 
components. addition art provision, operational aspects delivering
such programmes must considered.
