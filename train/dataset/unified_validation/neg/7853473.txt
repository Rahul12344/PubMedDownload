frcase highly neurovirulent murine leukemia virus causes a
noninflammatory spongiform neurodegenerative disease neonatal inoculation. 
the central nervous system (cns) infection wide-spread, involving several
different cell types, whereas lesions localized motor areas the
brain spinal cord. inoculation frcase 10 days age (p10) results in
viremia, infection cns restricted neurological disease not
observed (m. czub, s. czub, f. mcatee, j. portis, j. virol. 65:2539-2544,
1991). study, used developmental resistance restrict the
extent distribution frcase brain examine whether the
spongiform degeneration consequence infection cells proximity to
the lesions. two approaches used infect brain p10. first,
mice inoculated frcase p10 induce viremia p17 were
subjected focal cns injury within brain regions known susceptible to
virus-induced spongiform degeneration. injury resulted local inflammation,
glial activation, migration inflammatory cells wound site, and
high-level parenchymal infection wound site. however, evidence of
spongiform neurodegeneration observed period 3 months. second
approach involved implantation frcase-infected microglia cns >
or = p10. resulted microglial engraftment focal cns infection
unilaterally implantation sites bilaterally along white matter tracts 
of corpus callosum pons cells subventricular layers 
lateral cerebral ventricles. strikingly, focal spongiform degeneration
colocalized sites infection. contrast wounding experiments,
the implantation model associated inflammatory response or
significant glial activation. results studies suggest (i) the
developmental resistance cns infection lies blood-brain barrier 
and bypassed direct introduction brain virus-infected
cells, (ii) neuropathology induced virus consequence local
effects infection appear require endothelial neuronal
infection, (iii) elements inflammatory response and/or glial
activation may modulate expression neuropathology induced neurovirulent
retroviruses.
