following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) integration host cell 
dna, viral promoter become transcriptionally silent absence of
appropriate signals factors. hiv-1 gene expression dependent regulatory
elements contained within long terminal repeat (ltr) drive synthesis
of viral rnas proteins interaction multiple host viral
factors. previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)
within ccaat/enhancer binding protein (c/ebp) site sp site iii (3t, c-to-t 
change position 3, 5t, c-to-t change position 5 binding site,
respectively, compared consensus b sequence) low affinity
binding sites correlate advanced stages hiv-1 disease. stably
transfected cell lines containing wild type, 3t, 5t, 3t5t ltrs were
developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, t, monocytic cell lines to
explore ltr phenotypes associated genotypic changes an
integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. results suggest in
nonexpressing cell clones ltr-driven gene expression occurs snp-specific
manner response ltr activation treatment trichostatin treatment, 
indicating possible cell type snp-specific mechanism behind epigenetic 
control ltr activation.
