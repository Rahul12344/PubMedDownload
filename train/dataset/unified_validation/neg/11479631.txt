many biological processes result either cell death cessation cell
growth. however, plasmid- retrovirus-based mammalian expression vectors in
which possible construct representative cdna libraries cannot be
readily recovered cells actively dividing. limited the
efficiency selection recombinant genes mediate either lytic events 
growth arrest. examples include genes encode target antigens of
cytotoxic cells, genes promote stem-cell differentiation pro-apoptotic
genes. successfully constructed representative cdna libraries a
poxvirus-based vector recovered cells undergone
lethality-based selection. strategy applied selection gene 
that encodes cytotoxic t-cell target antigen common several independently
derived tumors.
