background: new isolate aura virus serendipitously discovered cell
culture contaminant reported manuscript. aura virus belongs the
family togaviridae classified genus alphavirus. two 
reports aura virus isolation mosquitoes scientific literature, and
the existence vertebrate host still unknown. discovery new
isolate based transmission electron microscopy nucleic acid
amplification non-specific rt-pcr amplification protocol followed by
sequencing.
results: genetic analysis shown new virus shares high degree of
identity previously described isolate (genbank: af126284.1). major
difference observed nsp3 gene 234-nucleotide duplication
has identified. furthermore, pronounced difference observed cell
cultures compared data available previously described isolate.
cell permissiveness phenotypic characteristics c6/36, vero bhk-21
cells found differ previous reports. may due genetic 
differences observed.
conclusions: genetic biological characteristics new aura virus
isolate suggestive viral adaptation cell substrate. development
of cdna clone lend perspective better understanding results
as well open avenues use biotechnological tool, seen other
alphaviruses.
