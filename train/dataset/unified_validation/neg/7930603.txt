deoxyspergualin (dsg) novel immunosuppressive agent recently shown bind
to constitutive heat shock protein 70, involved binding and
intracellular transport antigenic peptides. study, show dsg

specific monocytes preincubation cells dsg inhibit their
proliferation monocytes pulsed tetanus toxoid ag 16 h, whereas the
presence dsg ag pulsing monocytes inhibited ability to
stimulate cell proliferation. dsg down-regulate expression mhc
class ii molecules monocytes, inhibitory effect dsg cell
proliferation reversed addition il-2, addition of
the costimulatory signals il-1, il-6, anti-cd28. studies two human t
cell clones, ha1.7 pf5, specific, respectively, peptides spanning amino
acids 307-319 256-270 influenza hemagglutinin, showed dsg inhibited
the proliferation clones native hemagglutinin molecule but
minimally affected proliferation peptides. data suggest that
dsg interferes ag processing and/or presentation.
