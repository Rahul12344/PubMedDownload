background: hepatitis b virus cause acute disease several chronic
conditions, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis liver cancer.in 1982,
hepatitis b vaccine developed. since 1984, many immunization programs against
hepatitis b implemented several countries 15 years later can
visualize epidemiological changes countries.objective: review
the papers published results hepatitis b immunization programs in
several countries asia, africa, europe (italy) peru, since 1984.methods:
pertinent literature identified medline (1980-2000) references quoted 
in published papers. results: impact vaccination hepatitis b 
the incidence acute disease, chronic carriers, hepatitis b virus prevalence
and hepatocarcinoma incidence, anayzed.the following results obtained:
in afragola (italy), reduction acute disease incidence 63 cases/100,000
population vaccination (1983), 3 cases/100,000 population the
vaccination (1997), obtained hbsag carriers rate decreased: 13.4% to
3.7% general population 6.8% 0.7% infant
population.infection prevalence: 66.9% 34.2% general population. in
taiwan:hbsag carriers rate decreased: 10.0% <1.0% children 1 to
10 years old.infection prevalence: 38.0% 16.0% children 13 years
old. peru:infection prevalence: 24.4-30.4% 2.3-5.1% children 3
and 4 years old. senegal:hbsag carriers rate decreased: 18.7% 2.2% 
children. gambia:hbsag carriers rate decreased: 10.0% 0.6% in
children.finally, hepatocarcinoma incidence children 6 14 years
old, decreased 0.70/100,000 children 0.36/100,000 (p<0.01) in
taiwan.conclusion: results studies support hypothesis the
vaccination hepatitis b virus infection reduce incidence acute
disease, carriers rate, prevalence infection hepatocarcinoma
incidence.
