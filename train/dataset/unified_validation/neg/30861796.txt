the effect tomato yellow leaf curl virus (tylcv) total yield yield
components various resistant f1 tomato cultivars new breeding lines was
evaluated field. seeds f1 hybrids 8484, 3761, fiona, tyking and
the new breeding lines ty172 ty197 sown insect-proof greenhouse.
when seedlings reached first-leaf stage, inoculated tylcv 
by means whitefly vector bemisia tabaci. noninoculated plants 
cultivar line exposed nonviruliferous whiteflies served as
controls. short recovery period, plants transplanted the
field. inoculated plants cultivar line compared their
respective control, noninoculated plants, terms total yield, average fruit 
weight number, plant fresh weight. disease symptom development virus 
accumulation inoculated plants monitored. substantial
differences among different entries tested extent yield loss
relative corresponding noninoculated control plants well viral dna
accumulation levels. plants ty172 ty197 suffered least relative yield 
loss contained lowest level viral dna. therefore, two lines
exhibited highest level resistance. results clearly demonstrate 
ability various resistant tomato cultivars lines inhibit the
effects virus, even following inoculation early stage plant
development.
