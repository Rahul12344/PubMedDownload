northern (rna) blot analysis used compare immediate-early (ie) transcripts
among strains bovine herpesvirus type 1 type 5 differing neurovirulent 
potential. results obtained neurovirulent strain n569 compared to
those two non-neurovirulent strains, jura k22. strain n569 expressed
three major ie transcripts similar size transcription pattern as
previously reported strain jura k22 (wirth et al., 1989, 1991, 1992),
except differences 5' terminal sequence common alternative
spliced ie transcripts ier4.2 ier2.9. significant differences were
discovered minor ie transcripts. transcribed joined genome
ends replicative phase found drastically overexpressed for
strain n569 ie condition. among two long ie transcripts were
detected clearly strain n569, however hardly recognized strain jura and
k22. two transcripts found encoded addition joined
terminal hindiii genome fragments second hindiii fragment j left 
genome end.
