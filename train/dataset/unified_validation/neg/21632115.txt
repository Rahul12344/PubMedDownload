objective: analyse records past influenza outbreaks determine a
definition pandemics.
methods: analysis publications large outbreaks influenza have
occurred since 1889/90, match results current definitions 
of influenza pandemic.
results: according general understanding pandemic, nine outbreaks 
influenza since 1889/90 satisfy definition; however, two these,
occurring 1900 1933, data limited. special condition an
influenza pandemic requires, one definition, virus strain responsible
could arisen previous circulating strain mutation; in
the second, new strain different subtype previously
circulating strain. restrictions deny pandemic status two, and
possibly three, influenza outbreaks pandemics according more
general understanding term. observations suggest a
re-evaluation criteria define influenza pandemics carried 
out.
conclusion: contradiction outlined brings previous definitions of
an influenza pandemic question; however, resolved defining an
influenza pandemic following criteria. thus, influenza pandemic arises 
at single, specific place spreads rapidly involve numerous countries.
the haemagglutinin (ha) emergent virus cross-react serologically 
with previously dominant virus strain(s), significant lack 
immunity population emergent virus. three criteria are
interlinked determined early alert authorities could respond
appropriately. criteria associated pandemics necessarily
retrospective, although important valid. implications definition 
are discussed.
