in hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection-preventing programs, serum plasma levels 
of antibody hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) important determine 
whether individuals protective not. compared anti-hbs responses using
passive hemagglutination assay (mycell) chemiluminescent immunoassay
(architect) among four recipient groups hb vaccines, meinyu, hby, bimmugen and
heptavax ii, approved japan. overall, total 1875
vaccinees mycell results showed recipient groups meinyu hby acquired
higher anti-hbs levels bimmugen heptavax ii. comparison of
anti-hbs responses mycell architect recipient groups meinyu
(n=150), hby (n=218), bimmugen (n=260), heptavax ii (n=47) demonstrated the
order vaccinees' responses, geometric mean titers, ratios acquiring
high antibody levels (mycell titers 1024, architect measurements 1000
miu/ml), ratios unsuccessful antibody responses (mycell titers
under 8, architect measurements 10 miu/ml), somewhat different between
the two assays. comparison architect measurements given mycell titers
revealed bimmugen-recipients showed significantly lower values hby- or
heptavax ii-recipients. around critical protective levels, 5 22
bimmugen-recipients mycell titers 16 32 showed architect measurements
under 10 miu/ml, 8 11 heptavax ii-recipients mycell titers 8 
demonstrated architect measurements 10 miu/ml. thus, discrepancies in
anti-hbs evaluation mycell architect seemed partly depend on
administered vaccines. results indicate anti-hbs concentration be
evaluated carefully could completely prevent hbv infection.
