cronobacter sakazakii infection particularly harmful infants, putative 
virulence factors prophage origin identified c. sakazakii. in
this study, phage ent39118 isolated wild-type c. sakazakii; it
belongs family siphoviridae. genomic sequence phage ent39118 was
composed circular double-stranded dna length 39,012 bp. sequence
of ent39118 showed weak sequence similarity reported regions the
prophage sequences c. sakazakii baa-894 genome. knowledge, 
the first study genomic sequencing annotation temperate phage,
which obtained c. sakazakii isolate powdered infant formula.
