studies mechanism action michellamine b, novel anti-human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) alkaloid tropical plant ancistrocladus
korupensis, revealed compound acts two distinct stages the
hiv life cycle. compound direct effect hiv virions not
block initial binding hiv target cells. postinfection time course
studies revealed agent partially inhibited hiv-induced cell killing 
syncytium formation added 48 h following acute infection; however,
viral reproduction fully inhibited compound added
immediately infection. time-limited treatments hiv-infected cells
revealed michellamine b present continuously provide maximum
antiviral protection. hiv replication cells infection already
fully established chronically infected cells unaffected michellamine
b. biochemical studies showed michellamine b inhibited enzymatic
activities reverse transcriptases (rts) hiv type 1 hiv type 2 as
well two different nonnucleoside drug-resistant rts specific amino acid
substitutions. addition, human dna polymerases alpha beta inhibited
by alkaloid. michellamine b exerted potent dose-dependent inhibition of
cell fusion two independent cell-based fusion assays. thus, michellamine b
acts early stage hiv life cycle inhibiting rt well 
later stages inhibiting cellular fusion syncytium formation.
