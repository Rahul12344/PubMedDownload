major histocompatibility complex (mhc) gene products expressed human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected cells incorporated lipid
envelope hiv virions. macaques immunized human mhc gene products are
protected simian immunodeficiency virus challenge virus grown in
cells expressing mhc alleles. relate findings to
mother-to-child transmission hiv-1, investigations whether sharing hla
between mother infant influenced risk transmission hiv-1 the
child carried out. class hla concordance independently associated with
a stepwise increase risk perinatal hiv-1 transmission each
additional concordant allele (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval,
1.36-5.07; p = .003). thus, discordant hla may provide infants means of
protection hiv-1 result allogeneic infant anti-maternal mhc
immune responses.
