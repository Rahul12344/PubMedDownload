introduction: different dengue virus (denv) serotypes associated with
greater epidemic potential. turn, increased frequency cases severe
forms dengue associated cocirculation several serotypes. 
because colombia country endemic presence four denv
serotypes, aim study evaluate vivo vitro
replication denv-2 denv-3 strains individual infection and
coinfection conditions.
methodology: c6/36ht cells infected two strains individually or
simultaneously (coinfection). replication capacity evaluated rt-qpcr, 
the effects cell viability assessed mtt (3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. additionally,
aedes aegypti mosquitoes artificially fed two strains serotype
individually simultaneously. viral genomes quantified rt-qpcr 
the survival infected mosquitoes compared uninfected
controls.
results: single infections, three strains significantly affected c6/36ht cell 
viability, significant differences found replication
capacities strains serotype. vivo infections,
mosquito survival affected, significant differences replication
between strains serotype found. finally, coinfections,
serotype 2 replicated thousandfold greater efficiency serotype 3 
both vitro vivo.
conclusions: due cocirculation serotypes endemic regions, further
studies coinfections natural environment would understanding
of transmission dynamics affect denv infection epidemiology.
