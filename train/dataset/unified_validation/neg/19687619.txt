treatment aids (hiv) hepatitis c virus needs protease inhibitors (pi) to
prevent viral replication. uses pi therapy usually associated a
decrease body weight dyslipidemia. acylation stimulating protein (asp) 
a protein synthesized adipocytes increase triglycerides biosynthesis, for
that relation pi asp adipogenesis tested work. asp
expression increased 3t3-l1 differentiation reached peak day 
8 cell maturation. addition pi adipocytes differentiation dose
dependently significantly (p < 0.5) inhibited degree triglycerides
(tg) accumulation. moreover, presence asp (450 ng/ml) media significantly
(p < 0.5) stimulated degree tg accumulation additive
stimulation asp added insulin (10 microg/ml). finally, asp 
different doses (low, 16.7; medium, 45 high, 450 ng/ml) incubated dose
of x150 pi, asp partially inhibited pi-inhibited adipogenesis tg
accumulation. results study show pi inhibit lipids accumulation 
and confirm role asp tg biosynthesis adipogenesis.
