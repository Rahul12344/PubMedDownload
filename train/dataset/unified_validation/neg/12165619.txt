objective: hospitalization rate bronchiolitis cause among us
children younger 1 year estimated 31.2 per 1000. data exist on
respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)-specific hospitalization rates among high-risk 
native americans alaska natives, incidence rsv
hospitalization estimated 150 per 1000 among infants younger 1 year. 
we aimed estimate rsv hospitalization rates among navajo white mountain
apache children younger 2 years.
methods: conducted prospective population-level hospital-based surveillance to
determine rsv hospitalization rates among navajo white mountain apache
children younger 2 years. 1997 2000, children admitted 
for acute lower respiratory tract infection october 1 march 31 
nasopharyngeal aspirate obtained tested rsv commercial enzyme
immunoassay kits. reviewed charts children tested positive rsv
antigen determine disease severity.
results: 3 rsv seasons (1997-2000), 51.3% 1837 admissions acute
lower respiratory tract infection among children younger 2 years were
attributed rsv infection. overall seasonal rsv hospitalization rate among 
children younger 2 years 63.6 per 1000 91.3 per 1000 among children 
younger 1 year. univariate analysis, predictors severity included
age <6 months (relative risk: 6.8; 95% confidence interval: 3.1-17.0).
conclusions: navajo white mountain apache children high risk rsv
disease requiring hospitalization. lower threshold hospitalization or
underlying chronic conditions predispose severe rsv disease seem
to explain high rsv hospitalization rates population.
