purpose: determine incidence non-aids-defining cancers (nadc) in
hiv-infected patients (p1) (p2) use highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart) relative observed french general
population (fgp) age sex.
patients methods: sex- age-adjusted nadc standardized incidence ratios
(sir), fgp reference, estimated 1992 1995 (p1) 1996 
1999 (p2) french hospital database hiv prospective hospital cohort study.
results: nadcs diagnosed 260 patients p1 391 patients during
p2 among 77,025 patients included database january 1, 1992,
and december 31, 1999. estimated incidence cancers higher in
hiv-infected men fgp periods (p1 sir = 2.36 p2 sir =
1.91). excess cancers observed among hiv-infected women either
period. incidence cancers change p1 p2 either sex (sir 
= 0.96 men 1.00 women). contrast, incidence hodgkin's disease
(hd) higher fgp sexes periods increased p2 as
compared p1; incidence lung cancer higher sexes p2.
conclusion: relative fgp, overall incidence nadcs increased in
hiv-infected men women differ p1 p2. hd
was much common hiv infection, potential role haart hd
cannot excluded.
