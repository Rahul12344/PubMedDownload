background: meta-analyses general population studies report mean low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) reductions 30% <50% moderate-intensity
and ≥50% high-intensity statins. persons living human immunodeficiency 
virus (plwh) high risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd),
yet many elevated ldl-c.
objective: evaluate ldl-c response statin initiation among plwh.
methods: conducted retrospective cohort study plwh initiating statins
between 2009 2013 (n = 706). patients categorized mutually
exclusive groups following hierarchy: history coronary heart disease
(chd), diabetes, prestatin ldl-c ≥190 mg/dl, 10-year predicted ascvd risk ≥7.5%, 
and none (ie, unknown statin indication). primary outcome 
≥30% reduction ldl-c statin initiation.
results: among patients initiating statins, 5.8% history chd, 13.6% 
diabetes, 6.2% ldl-c ≥190 mg/dl, 35.4% 10-year ascvd risk ≥7.5%, and
39.0% unknown statin indication. among patients history chd,
31.7% achieved ≥30% ldl-c reduction compared 25.0%, 59.1%, 33.9% among
those diabetes, ldl-c ≥190 mg/dl, 10-year ascvd risk ≥7.5%,
respectively. multivariable adjusted analyses compared patients an
unknown statin indication, ldl-c ≥ 190 mg/dl associated prevalence
ratio ldl-c reduction ≥30% 1.81 (95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.45),
whereas statistically significant association present history chd, 
diabetes, 10-year ascvd risk ≥7.5%.
conclusion: low percentage plwh achieved expected reductions ldl-c
after statin initiation, highlighting unmet need ascvd risk reduction.
