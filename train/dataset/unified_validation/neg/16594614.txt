rna interference (rnai) sequence-specific gene-silencing mechanism 
been proposed function defence mechanism eukaryotic cells against
viruses transposons. rnai first observed plants form a
mysterious immune response viral pathogens. rnai a
response exogenous genetic material. small rnas termed microrna (mirna)
regulate cellular gene expression programs control diverse steps cell
development physiology. discovery exogenously delivered short
interfering rna (sirna) trigger rnai mammalian cells made a
powerful technique generating genetic knock-outs. also raises the
possibility use rnai technology therapeutic tool pathogenic
viruses. indeed, inhibition virus replication reported several
human pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis b c
viruses influenza virus. reviewed field antiviral rnai research 
2003 (haasnoot et al. 2003), many new studies recently published.
in review, present complete listing antiviral strategies
published including december 2004. latest developments rnai 
field antiviral application described.
