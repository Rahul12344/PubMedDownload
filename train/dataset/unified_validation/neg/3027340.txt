a series substituted phenyl analogues 5-[[4-(4,5-dihydro-2-oxazolyl)
phenoxy]alkyl]-3-methylisoxazoles synthesized evaluated vitro
against several human rhinovirus (hrv) serotypes. substituents 2-position 
greatly enhanced activity compared unsubstituted compound. many of
these compounds exhibited mean mics (mic) five serotypes low 0.40
microm. mean mic correlated well (r = 0.83) mic80 (the concentration
that inhibited 80% serotypes tested). quantitative structure-activity
relationship study indicated strong dependency mic lipophilicity (log p) 
in combination inductive effects (sigma m) bulk factors (mw).
