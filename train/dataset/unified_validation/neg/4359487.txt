in chick-embryo fibroblasts infected t5, temperature-sensitive mutant of
schmidt-ruppin rous sarcoma virus, level catenated dimeric oligomeric 
mitochondrial dna temperature-dependent correlates phenotypic
manifestation transformation. permissive temperature (36 degrees ),
where transformation expressed, 2- 3-fold elevated level characteristic
of cells transformed wild-type rous sarcoma virus observed, the
nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees ), cells appear normal behave 
normally, oligomer level characteristic uninfected cells. temperature 
shifts 41 36 degrees vice versa resulted phenotypic reversion 
reversals respective levels multiple-length dna. cellular growth rates 
were altered. treatment control cells cycloheximide resulted a
5-fold increase oligomeric dna, whereas exposure to
9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyladenine little effect. inhibitors, nuclear
but mitochondrial dna synthesis inhibited. possible relation of
formation oligomeric mitochondrial dna alterations mitochondrial
membranes transformed cells inhibition protein synthesis the
cytoplasm discussed.
