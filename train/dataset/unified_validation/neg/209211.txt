equine infectious anemia virus (eiav) recently shown possess a
high-molecular-weight rna genome virion reverse transcriptase. completed
the demonstration eiav retrovirus showing presence proviral
dna equine cells infected vitro, normal horse dna. studies
were performed using highly representative cdna probe synthesized the
virion polymerase. found cdna reassociated extensively, with
high thermal stability, either viral rna dna extracted infected
cells, showed detectable reassociation dna uninfected horse
cells. similarly, sequences related eiav neither found dna four
other equus species, variety mammals including sheep, cows,
pigs- dogs, cats, humans; eiav cdna hybridize variety other
retrovirus rnas. experiments performed conditions low
stringency enable detection distantly related sequences, sufficient 
ratio dan cdna allow detection less one viral copy per haploid
genome. conclude eiav endogenous virus horse the
other species tested.
