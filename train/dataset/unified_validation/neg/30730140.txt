outbreaks porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) caused significant
lethality rates neonatal piglets, pose serious threat swine
industry worldwide. available commercial vaccines fail protect the
emergence high virulence pedv variants. therefore, endemic state the
pedv infection suckling piglets highlights urgent need uncovering 
molecular determinants disease pathogenesis. study, stable isotope
labeling amino acids cell culture (silac), combined high-performance
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry performed determine
proteomic differences pedv-infected mock-infected vero cells 18 h 
postinfection. silac-based approach identified 4508 host-cell proteins, of
which 120 significantly up-regulated 103 significantly
down-regulated â‰¥95% confidence. alterations expression selected
proteins verified western blot. several signaling metabolic pathways
including mevalonate pathway superpathway cholesterol biosynthesis
were triggered infection highly virulent strain linked to
host innate immunity. 25-hc, inhibitor mevalonate pathway, exhibited
potent antiviral activity pedv infection. meanwhile, the
cell-cycle-related functions significantly regulated, may likely be
responsible viral replication pathogenicity pedv.
