the nucleotide sequence envelope (env) gene long terminal repeat
(ltr) infectious clone rauscher mink cell focus-inducing (r-mcf) virus
has determined compared published env gene ltr sequences of
friend (f)- moloney (m)-mcf viruses. sequence shows r-mcf virus,
like mcf viruses, recombinant virus. env gene contains sequences
which acquired env gene mouse genome confer 
mcf virus dualtropic host range. unlike f-mcf m-mcf viruses, r-mcf virus 
will replicate nih 3t3 cells. deduced amino acid sequence gp70
of r-mcf differs f- m-mcf viruses 15 amino acids between
residues 49 138 gp70. differences amino acid sequences may be
responsible inability r-mcf virus replicate nih 3t3 cells. the
host range two hybrid viruses constructed vitro consistent this
hypothesis. r-mcf virus friend murine leukemia virus (f-mlv) show 98%
identity env gene 3' acquired env sequences. contrasts
with 82% identity env gene r-mcf virus m-mlv. ltr r-mcf
shows 98% identity ltr f-mcf compared 88% identity ltr
of m-mcf. striking similarity sequences r-mcf, f-mcf, and
f-mlv surprising since rauscher virus friend virus thought 
have originated independently. high degree similarity suggests that
rauscher friend viruses common origin. contrast m-mlv, which
induces predominantly lymphoid disease, r- f-mcf viruses induce an
erythroproliferative disease nih swiss mice. hybrid r-mcf virus a
genome derived primarily r-mcf virus 3' end including u3 region
derived m-mlv induces lymphoid disease instead erythroid disease.
this result indicates u3 region determines tissue
specificity mcf virus-induced disease. suggested putative
viral enhancers u3 region play two roles process leukemogenesis:
in friend rauscher disease, viral enhancers act increasing the
transcription mcf env gene; thymic lymphoma, enhancers activate
mainly expression cellular genes.
