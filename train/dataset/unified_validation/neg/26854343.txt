porcine circovirus 2 (pcv2) etiological agent postweaning multisystemic
wasting syndrome. pcv2 orf3 protein nonstructural protein known induce
apoptosis, little known biological function orf3 protein.
therefore, undertook study map orf3 protein epitopes recognized a
panel monoclonal antibodies (mabs) characterize putative nuclear
localization (nls) nuclear export (nes) sequences orf3. linear
epitopes targeted two previously published mabs 3b1 1h3 novel mouse 
mab 3c3 defined using overlapping pools peptides. here, find orf3
in pcv2 infected cells contains conformational epitope targeted antibody
3c3, distinct linear epitopes recognized antibodies 3b1 
1h3 recombinant orf3 protein. results suggest linear epitope
recognized 3b1 1h3 masked pcv2 infected cells, the
conformational epitope unique pcv2 infection. furthermore, find that
orf3 protein expressed cytoplasm early stages pcv2 infection then
accumulated nucleus time. moreover, localize nes n-terminus
(residues 1-35aa) orf3 plays critical role nuclear export activity.
these findings provide novel insight deepens understanding the
biological function pcv2 orf3.
