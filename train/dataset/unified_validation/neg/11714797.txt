light, member tnf family cytokines (homologous lymphotoxin,
exhibits inducible expression competes hsv glycoprotein for
herpesvirus entry mediator, receptor expressed cells), induced on
activated cells mediates costimulatory antitumor activity vitro.
relatively little information available vivo effects light
expression, particularly within cell compartment. work, describe
transgenic mice express human light control cd2 promoter,
resulting constitutive transgene expression cells lymphocyte
lineage. light-transgenic animals exhibit abnormalities lymphoid tissue
architecture distribution lymphocyte subsets. also show signs 
inflammation severe intestine, along tissue destruction
of reproductive organs. light-mediated effects recapitulated 
immune-deficient mice reconstituted bone marrow light-transgenic
donor mice. cells light-transgenic mice activated phenotype 
mucosal cells exhibit enhanced th1 cytokine activity. results indicate that
light may function important regulator cell activation, implicate 
light signaling pathways inflammation focused mucosal tissues.
