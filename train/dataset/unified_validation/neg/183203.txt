regulation active alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport expressed membrane
vesicles mouse fibroblasts.

membrane vesicles isolated untransformed balb/c swiss mouse fibroblasts 
and transformed simian virus 40 catalyzed carrier-mediated uptake
of l-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. concentrative uptake required presence 
na+ gradient (external na+ greater internal na+) occurred independently 
of endogenous (na+ + k+) atpase activity. process electrogenic, since
uptake stimulated k+ diffusion gradient (internal greater external) in
the presence valinomycin addition na+ salt permeant ion,
conditions expected create interior-negative membrane potential. the
initial rate concentrative uptake l-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid its
maximal accumulation, driven standard na+ gradient, decreased in
vesicles density-inhibited, untransformed cells increased 
cells transformed simian virus 40 compared vesicles proliferating
untransformed cells. increased maximal velocity (vmax) uptake stimulated by
na+ gradient observed vesicles transformed cells compared 
from untransformed cells, suggesting increase number carriers 
their mobility. since relative extent accumulation model amino
acid driven standard na+ gradient also differed growth transformed
status, additional possibility cellular regulation process could
be alteration membrane na+ permeability carrier response na+.
