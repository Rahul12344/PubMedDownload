the present studies designed determine whether cd25 marker
could distinguish cells productively latently infected hiv. this
was accomplished combining immunotoxin (it)-mediated killing cd25+ cells,
highly sensitive indirect immunofluorescence detect remaining cd25+ cells, and
pcr-mediated amplification proviral dna immunotoxin-treated vs untreated
hiv-infected cells. results demonstrate that: 1) direct immunofluorescence
3 8% pbmcs cd25+, whereas indirect immunofluorescence 30% cd25+.
the increased number cd25+ cells due detection highly
sensitive indirect immunofluorescence assay. 60% cd25+ cells are
cd4+ 12% cd8+. 2) treatment hiv-infected pbmcs anti-cd25 it
for 6 days eliminated cd25high cd25low cells decreased the
production p24 99%. 3) differences hiv proviral genome detected
in unfractionated pbmcs vs pbmcs cd25+ cells eliminated
by treatment. hence, pbmcs containing cd25+ cd25- cells express all
intermediate proviral species full-length double-stranded proviral dna. in
contrast, cd25- quiescent cells contain predominantly intermediate species. these
results confirm extend previous observations expression cd25 
distinguish latently infected cells cells producing virus.
