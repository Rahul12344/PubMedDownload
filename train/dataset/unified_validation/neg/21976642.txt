several arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever (hf) disease humans is
associated high morbidity significant mortality. arenavirus
nucleoprotein (np), abundant viral protein infected cells and
virions, encapsidates viral genome rna, np-rna complex, together
with viral l polymerase, forms viral ribonucleoprotein (vrnp) that
directs viral rna replication gene transcription. formation infectious
arenavirus progeny requires packaging vrnps budding particles, process 
in arenavirus matrix-like protein (z) plays central role. present 
study, characterized np-z interaction prototypic arenavirus
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv). lcmv np domain interacted
with z overlapped previously documented c-terminal domain counteracts
the host type interferon (ifn) response. however, found single amino
acid mutations affect anti-ifn function lcmv np disrupt the
np-z interaction, suggesting within c-terminal region np different
amino acid residues critically contribute two distinct segregable np
functions. similar np-z interaction confirmed hf arenavirus lassa
virus (lasv). notably, lcmv np interacted similarly lcmv z lasv z, 
while lasv np interacted lasv z. results also suggest presence 
of conserved protein domain within np specific amino acid residues
playing key roles determining specificity np-z interaction may
influence viability reassortant arenaviruses. addition, np-z
interaction represents potential target development antiviral drugs 
to combat human-pathogenic arenaviruses.
