by utilizing epstein-barr virus (ebv)-negative burkitt's lymphoma line (bjab) 
and several ebv-positive sub-lines derived vitro infection, 
been shown previously presence ebv genome b cell line 
reversibly associated deregulation myc expression. specifically, the
decline level myc transcripts observed ebv-negative bjab line as
cells approach stationary phase growth abrogated presence the
virus. studies described herein, mechanism deregulation myc in
ebv-converted bjab cells examined. shown presence ebv in
bjab cells associated changes rate transcription from
exons i, ii iii myc cells approached stationary phase growth. in
contrast, stability myc mrna altered ebv-positive bjab cells.
specifically, half-life myc mrna increased less 36 greater
than 70 min ebv-positive bjab lines cells progressed early late
exponential phase growth. alteration stability myc transcripts 
reversibly associated presence virus, since ebv-negative
revertant bjab line display increase stability myc transcripts
in late exponential phase growth. addition, progression early late 
exponential phase growth two ebv-immortalized lymphoblastoid lines derived 
from normal human b cells also associated prolongation half-life 
of myc.(abstract truncated 250 words)
