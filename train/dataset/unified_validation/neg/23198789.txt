porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) causes porcine
reproductive respiratory syndrome disease (prrs), disease a
significant economic impact swine industry. study,
single-stranded dna (ssdna) aptamers high specificity affinity against
vr-2332 strain prrsv type ii successfully obtained. 19 candidates, the
lb32 aptamer found specific sensitive vr-2332 strain
according aptamer-based surface plasmon resonance (spr) analysis. the
detection vr-2332 prrsv type ii successfully accomplished using the
enzyme-linked antibody-aptamer sandwich (elaas) method. detection limit of
elaas 4.8 Ã— 10(0) tcid(50)/ml comparable previous
reports pcr-based detection require complicated equipment
or extra costs. moreover, elaas-based prrsv detection showed similar
sensitivity vr-2332 samples spiked diluted swine serum in
buffer. therefore, vr-2332 strain-specific aptamer assay method with
high specificity used alternative method fast precise
detection prrsv.
