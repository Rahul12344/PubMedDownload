human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) incorporates several host cell
components budding infected cell. one abundant
host-derived molecules acquired hiv-1 hla-dr determinant major
histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc-ii) molecules. fact cd4 
natural ligand mhc-ii prompted us determine virally embedded
cellular components affect biology virus. herein, report for
the first time incorporation cellular hla-dr1 within hiv-1 enhances
its infectivity. observation made possible virions bearing not
bearing surfaces host-derived hla-dr1 glycoproteins. virus stocks
were prepared transient-expression system based transfection 293t
cells recombinant luciferase-encoding hiv-1 molecular clone along with
plasmids encoding alpha beta chains hla-dr1. cell-free virions
recovered transfected cells shown efficiently incorporated
host-derived hla-dr1 glycoproteins. infectivity increased factor 1.6 
to 2.3 virions bearing surfaces host-derived hla-dr1. observed
enhancement hiv-1 infectivity independent virus stocks used was
seen several t-lymphoid cell lines, premonocytoid cell line, in
primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. finally, determined the
presence virion-bound cellular hla-dr1 associated faster kinetics of
virus infection. taken together, results suggest hla-dr-1-bearing
hiv-1 particles greater infectivity per picogram viral p24 protein 
hla-dr1-free virions.
