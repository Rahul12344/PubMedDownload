viral infection detected host innate immune system. innate immune cells
such dendritic cells macrophages detect nucleic acids derived viruses
through pattern recognition receptors (prrs). viral recognition prrs initiates
the activation signaling pathways lead production type interferon
and inflammatory cytokines, important elimination viruses.
two types prrs recognize viral nucleic acids, toll-like receptors (tlr)
and rig-i-like rna helicases (rlh), identified. tlrs, tlr3
recognizes viral double-stranded (ds) rna, tlr7 human tlr8 identify viral
single-stranded (ss) rna tlr9 detects viral dna. tlrs located in
endosomal compartments, whereas rlh present cytoplasm they
detect viral dsrna ssrna. review role tlrs rlhs the
antiviral innate immune response.
