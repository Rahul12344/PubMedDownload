a pairwise comparison nucleic acid sequence 168 bases 152
wild-type unique cell culture-adapted strains hepatitis virus (hav)
revealed hav strains differentiated genetically seven unique
genotypes (i vii). general, nucleotide sequence viruses different
genotypes differs 15 25% positions within segment genome.
viruses four genotypes (i, ii, iii vii) recovered cases
of hepatitis humans, whereas viruses three genotypes (iv, v
and vi) isolated simian species developing hepatitis a-like
illness captivity. among non-epidemiologically related human hav strains, 
81 characterized genotype i, 19 genotype iii. within these
major genotypes, two distinct groups (subgenotypes), differed in
sequence approximately 7.5% base positions. genotype subgenotype
has characteristic amino acid sequence region polyprotein, 
the divergent genotypes differing 10 56 residues. strains recovered
from geographical regions belonged common (endemic) genotype, whereas
strains regions belonged several, probably imported, genotypes.
thus, hav strains recovered north america part closely
related nucleotide sequence level, whereas regions, japan
and western europe, hav strains derived multiple genotypes or
sub-genotypes. data indicate patterns endemic transmission be
differentiated situations infections imported due travel.
