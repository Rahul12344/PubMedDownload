alterations trna isoaccepting species erythroid differentiation 
friend leukemia cell.

lin vk, agris pf.

the chromatographic profiles isoaccepting trnas analyzed five time
points 96 hr, dimethylsulfoxide induced, erythroid-like
differentiation friend leukemia cells. sixty-four isoaccepting species trna
for 16 amino acids resolved rpc-5 chromatography. relative amounts of
trnaphe, trnaile, trnaval species maintained cells during
differentiation; whereas relative amounts isoacceptor trnas
for 13 amino acids changed significantly. fluctuations amounts of
isoacceptors occurred 36 72 hr addition dimethysulfoxide,
corresponding globin mrna appearance hemoglobin synthesis, respectively.
in cases, thepredominant trna isoacceptors uninduced cells retained 
throughout differentiation. notable exceptions trna species threonine,
proline, methionine. isoacceptors occurring relatively smaller
amounts expressed times. changes possibly reflect the
cell's functional adaptation trna differentiation hemoglobin synthesis.
