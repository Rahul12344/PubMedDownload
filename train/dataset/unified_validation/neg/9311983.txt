mu dna transposition occurs within context higher order nucleoprotein
structures transpososomes. describe new set transpososomes mu
b-bound target dna interacts non-covalently previously characterized
intermediates prior actual strand transfer. interaction occur 
several points along reaction pathway: ler, type 0 type 1
complexes. formation target capture complexes, rapidly undergo
the strand transfer chemistry, rate-limiting step overall reaction.
these complexes provide alternate pathways strand transfer, thereby maximizing
transposition potential. versatility contrast characterized
transposons, normally capture target dna single point their
respective reaction pathways.
