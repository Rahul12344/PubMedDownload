this chapter outlines methods production dengue virus (denv) reporter 
virus particles (rvps) use assays measure antibody-mediated
neutralization enhancement denv infection. rvps pseudo-infectious
virions produced complementation self-replicating flavivirus replicon
with denv structural genes trans. rvps harvested transfected cells
are capable single round infection encapsidate replicon rna that
encodes reporter gene used enumerate infected cells. rvps may produced
using structural genes different denv serotypes, genotypes, mutants by
changing plasmids used complementation. modifications possible
including generating rvps varying levels uncleaved prm protein, which
resemble either immature mature form virus. neutralization potency 
is measured incubating rvps serial dilutions antibody, followed by
infection target cells express denv attachment factors. enhancement of
infection measured similarly using fc receptor-expressing cells capable of
internalizing antibody-virus complexes.
