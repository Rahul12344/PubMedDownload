several cd4 mimics reported hiv-1 entry inhibitors block
the interaction viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 cell
surface protein cd4. previously found lead compound 2 (yya-021) high
anti-hiv activity low cytotoxicity. pharmacokinetic analysis however showed
compound 2 wide tissue distribution relatively high distribution
volumes rats rhesus macaques. present study searched more
hydrophilic cd4 mimics view reducing tissue distribution. new
compound (5) 1,3-benzodioxolyl moiety found relatively high
anti-hiv activity significant cytotoxicity. compound 5 hydrophilic
than compound 2 pharmacokinetics intravenous administration of
compound 5 rhesus macaque showed compound 5 lower tissue
distribution compound 2, suggesting compound 5 possesses better
profile.
