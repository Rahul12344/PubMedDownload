to study enteropathogens, 100 fecal samples collected brazilian human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive population, without diarrhea.
giardia lamblia calicivirus significantly associated diarrhea as
were severe immunosuppression presence least one enteropathogen. no
sample positive rotavirus one asymptomatic individual carried
the astrovirus. concluded great diversity pathogens and
opportunistic infections studied population, high prevalence of
mixed colonization/infection. findings pave way future molecular
studies related expression virulence factors possibility 
pathogen-pathogen interactions, especially g. lamblia calicivirus.
these findings relevant improvement therapies controlling
diarrhea hiv-seropositive population.
