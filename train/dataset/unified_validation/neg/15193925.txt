measles virus (mv) infects dendritic cells (dcs) resulting immunosuppression. 
human dcs express two mv receptors: cd46 human signaling lymphocyte
activation molecule (hslam); thus, role played either alone unclear.
because wild-type (wt) mv uses hslam receptor preferentially, dissected the
molecular basis mv-dc interaction resultant immunosuppression 
hslam receptor creating transgenic (tg) mice expressing hslam dcs. after
infection wt mv, murine splenic dcs expressing hslam receptor less b7-1,
b7-2, cd40, mhc class i, mhc class ii molecules surfaces and
displayed increased rate apoptosis compared uninfected dcs.
further, mv-infected dcs failed stimulate allogeneic cells inhibited
mitogen-dependent t-cell proliferation. individual expression human slam,
interferon alpha/beta receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and
lymphotoxin-alpha beta cells required mv-infected dcs to
inhibit proliferation cells.
