trek-1 two-pore domain (k(2p)) potassium channel carries leak current
that time- voltage-independent. recently, potassium channels been
related cell proliferation k(2p) family channels, task-3,
have shown overexpressed specific neoplasms. study, we
addressed expression trek-1 prostatic tissues cell lines, we
have found potassium channel highly expressed prostate cancer but
is expressed normal prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia.
furthermore, expression trek-1 correlates strongly grade the
stage disease, suggesting causal link channel expression and
abnormal cell proliferation. vitro studies showed trek-1 highly
expressed pc3 lncap prostate cancer cell lines detectable in
normal prostate epithelial cells (npe). report, show that
overexpression trek-1 npe chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells leads 
significant increase proliferation. moreover, increased cell proliferation
rate pc3 cells trek-1 overexpressing cho cells could reduced when
trek-1 current reduced overexpression dominant-negative trek-1 mutant
or cells exposed trek-1 inhibitor. taken together, data
suggest trek-1 expression associated abnormal cell proliferation and
may novel marker molecular target prostate cancer.
