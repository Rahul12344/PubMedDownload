the global adoption vaccines combat disease hampered high cost of
vaccine manufacturing. work described herein follows two previous
publications (van der sanden et al., 2016; wu et al., 2017) report a
strategy enhance poliovirus rotavirus vaccine production genetic
modification vero cell lines used large-scale vaccine manufacturing.
crispr/cas9 gene editing tools used knockout vero target genes previously
shown play role polio- rotavirus production. subsequently,
small-scale models current industry manufacturing systems developed and
adopted assess increases polio- rotavirus output multiple stable
knockout cell lines. unlike previous studies, vero knockout cell lines failed
to achieve desired target yield increases. findings suggest additional
research required implementing genetically engineered vero
cell lines manufacturing process polio- rotavirus vaccines be
able supply vaccines reduced prices.
