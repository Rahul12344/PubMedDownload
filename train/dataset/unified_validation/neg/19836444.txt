mouse-adapted human influenza virus detectable olfactory bulbs mice 
within hours intranasal challenge associated enhanced local
cytokine mrna protein levels. determine whether signals olfactory
nerve influence unfolding acute phase response (apr), surgically
transected olfactory nerve mice prior influenza infection. then
compared responses olfactory-nerve-transected (ont) mice recorded
in sham-operated control mice using measurements body temperature, food
intake, body weight, locomotor activity immunohistochemistry cytokines
and viral antigen, h1n1. ont change baseline body temperature (tb);
however, onset virus-induced hypothermia delayed 13 h the
ont mice. locomotor activity, food intake body weights two groups were
similar. 15 h post-challenge fewer viral antigen-immunoreactive (ir) cells
were observed olfactory bulb (ob) ont mice compared sham controls.
the number tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha)- interleukin 1beta
(il1beta)-ir cells ont mice also reduced ob other
