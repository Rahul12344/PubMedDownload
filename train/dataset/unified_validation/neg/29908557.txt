bentysrepinine (y101), derivative phenyalanine dipeptide, novel
mechanism treatment hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection good
anti-hbv effect. present study, fluorometric-based high throughput
method using cytochrome p450 (cyp) screening kit adopted evaluate vitro
inhibition potential y101 cyp isoenzymes calculating remaining enzyme
activities inhibitory potential (ic(50) values) using determined values
of fluorescence intensity. result showed y101 exhibited little activity 
in inhibition cyp1a2, cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19 cyp2d6 (ic(50) > 100
μmol·l(-1)). y101 used treat human primary hepotocytes 72 h, the
enzyme activities cyp1a2, cyp2b6 cyp3a4 determined cocktail of
probe substrates three cyp isoforms. metabolites simultaneously 
determined using lc-ms/ms method. y101 activity induction of
cyp1a2, cyp2b6 cyp3a4 basis following results: 1 ratio of
enzyme activities test control groups 1 (varied
from 0.662 0.928); 2 induction potential y101 lower forty
percent compared positive groups. results suggest that
y101 little activity regulation metabolic drug-drug interactions
based cyp isoform changes following co-administration drugs.
