aim: investigate expression nucleoporin 88 (nup88) hepatitis b virus
(hbv) c virus (hcv)-related liver diseases.
methods: generated new monoclonal nup88 antibody investigate nup88
protein expression immunohistochemistry (ihc) 294 paraffin-embedded liver
specimens comprising stages hepatocellular carcinogenesis. addition, in
cell culture experiments hbv-positive (hepg2.2.15 hb611) hbv-negative
(hepg2) hepatoma cell lines tested nup88 expression by
western-immunoblotting test data obtained ihc.
results: specific nup88 expression found chronic hcv hepatitis and
unspecific chronic hepatitis, whereas weak nup88 expression was
detected normal liver. nup88 expression markedly reduced missing in
mild chronic hbv infection inversely correlated hbcag expression.
irrespective hbv- hcv-status, increasing nup88 expression observed 
in cirrhosis dysplastic nodules, nup88 highly expressed in
hepatocellular carcinomas. intensity nup88 expression significantly
increased carcinogenesis (p<0.0001) correlated dedifferentiation 
(p<0.0001). interestingly, nup88 protein expression significantly
downregulated hbv-positive hepg2.2.15 (p<0.002) hb611 (p<0.001) cell lines
as compared hbv-negative hepg2 cells.
conclusion: based immunohistochemical data, hbv hcv unlikely to
influence expression nup88 cirrhotic neoplastic liver tissue, but
point interaction hbv nuclear pore chronic hepatitis. the
expression nup88 nonneoplastic liver tissue might reflect enhanced
metabolic activity liver tissue. data strongly indicate dichotomous 
role nup88 non-neoplastic neoplastic conditions liver.
