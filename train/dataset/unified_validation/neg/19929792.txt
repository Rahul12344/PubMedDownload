screening everyone hiv least estimated cost-effective.
screening health care settings recommended help achieve goal.
health care settings often encounter patient repeatedly, is
unknown limited resources better allocated conduct repeat screening, or
to screen patients yet tested. reviewed data targeted ed based hiv
screening program 2003-2007. role prior testing history predictor
of undiagnosed hiv positivity assessed using negative binomial model
adjusted demographics risk behaviors. hiv testing provided 8,450
unique patients. 5,781 (70%) self-reporting prior hiv test. compared
with patients reporting prior test, relative risk hiv positivity for
those reporting test within prior year 0.90 (95%ci 0.48-1.66), 
those reporting prior test year previously relative risk was
0.91 (95%ci 0.48-1.73). among patients testing positive, report
a prior test median cd4 count 228 cells/mm(3) lower those
with prior test (ci(95) difference medians 20-436 cells/mm(3)).
diagnosis prevalent hiv among risk never tested
should priority. however, repeat screening target populations for
incident infection remains important results earlier diagnosis. recent
self-reported testing history associated undiagnosed positivity among
targeted patients irrespective timing prior test.
