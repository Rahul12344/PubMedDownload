aedes aegypti (l.) (diptera: culicidae) vector viruses causing dengue,
zika, chikungunya, yellow fever subsequently pose significant global
threat public health. sampling live mosquitoes useful for
surveillance purposes, traps targeting aedes kill captured mosquitoes. the
biogents sentinel (bgs) trap, gold standard capturing ae. aegypti, one
such trap. study, modified bgs trap increase survival of
captured ae. aegypti replacing trap's catch bag catch pot that
protects mosquitoes desiccation airflow. sucrose-soaked sponge or
nucleic acid preservative card also placed inside pot enhance
mosquito survival augment arbovirus detection. modifications bgs
significantly increased longevity mosquitoes captured weekly
survivals 93% semifield structure 86% field. high
survival rates resulted 3.5 times alive ae. aegypti captured weekly in
the modified bgs compared original bgs, despite 40% lower overall catch
rates. cheap simple trap modifications facilitate easier specimen
identification well experiments requiring live field-collected samples such
as virus detection mosquito saliva excreta.
