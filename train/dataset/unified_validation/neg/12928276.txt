aim: identify key risk factors management outcome severe
infective keratitis leading public hospital admission new zealand.
methods: 2 year period, admissions presumed infective keratitis 
auckland hospital identified. clinical records 103 cases were
retrospectively reviewed respect clinical features, risk factors,
management, outcomes.
results: mean time first symptoms signs presentation hospital 
was 8.9 (sd 15.5) days. majority subjects, 88%, least one the
risk factors commonly associated infective keratitis including previous
ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), 
and ocular trauma (24%). corneal scraping performed 92% total 
105 scrapes, 71% positive. bacteria isolated cases, the
majority gram positive organisms (72%). common isolates identified
were coagulase negative staphylococcus (16%), propionibacterium acnes (14%),
staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). addition,
yeasts isolated 5%, fungi 4%, virus 2%, chlamydia 1%.
importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted 33% culture positive cases.
antimicrobial treatment changed basis culture results 17 cases
(16.5%). median initial visual final best corrected visual acuity was
6/36-6/48 (logmar 0.86) (iqr 0.39-2.00) 6/12-6/15 (logmar 0.360) (iqr
0.15-1.70), respectively. previous ocular surgery topical corticosteroid use 
were significantly associated poorer visual acuity. mean hospital stay
was 5.8 days median 4.0 (iqr 2.0-8.0) days. longer duration stay was
associated presence hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery,
and poor visual acuity.
conclusions: infectious keratitis important cause ocular morbidity. a
significant proportion cases potentially modifiable risk factors.
previous ocular surgery topical corticosteroid use, particular, were
associated poorer visual outcomes. many cases severe keratitis might be
avoided, severity reduced, appropriate education patients and
ophthalmologists.
