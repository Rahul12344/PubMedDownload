pharmacological modulation cellular proteins means block virus
replication proposed alternative antiviral strategy may be
less susceptible others development viral drug resistance. recent 
evidence indicates ubiquitin-proteasome pathway interacts different
aspects hepatitis b virus (hbv) life cycle cell culture models virus
replication. therefore examined effect proteasome inhibition hbv
replication vivo using hbv transgenic mice. proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib (velcade) inhibits proteasome activity vivo used
therapeutically clinical treatment multiple myeloma. found a
single intravenous dose 1 mg bortezomib/kg body weight reduced virus
replication long 6 days. inhibition hbv bortezomib dose
dependent occurred step replication subsequent viral rna and
protein expression. reduction hbv replication result from
nonspecific hepatocellular toxicity mediated indirectly the
induction intrahepatic interferon response. thus, pharmacological
manipulation ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may represent alternative
therapeutic approach treatment chronic hbv infection.
