the pathogenesis swine vesicular disease (svd) studied following a
natural route infection. two experiments groups ten eight pigs
respectively introduced stable contaminated svd virus. at
various intervals stable exposure, pigs killed amount virus
was determined serum, vesicles (if present), spleen, kidney, seven
lymph glands representing various parts body. one day pigs 
introduced stable, five eight pigs viraemic virus could 
be isolated various tissues. 2 introduction, three four
pigs killed vesicular lesions feet. tonsils pigs killed
between 1 7 introduction stable virologically positive. 
four days introduction 50% pigs serologically positive 7
d pigs developed antibody response. study shows contact with
a svd virus contaminated environment equally infectious injection,
or direct contact svd infected pigs, causing rapid spread disease. 
because tonsil shown highly efficient trapping growing
circulating virus, recommend addition serological examination,
virus isolation pig tonsils used study epidemiology svd 
on farms infection present.
