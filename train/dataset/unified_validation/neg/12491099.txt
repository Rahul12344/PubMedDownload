helper component proteinase (hc-pro) multifunctional viral protein involved 
in vection movement potyvirus; suppression host post-transcriptional
gene silencing reaction; synergism potyvirus viruses, notably
potexvirus. hc-pro plum pox potyvirus (ppv) transiently expressed
in n. benthamiana n. clevelandii plants via potato virus x (pvx) vector, a
highly synergistic response leaf necrosis plant death, observed in
pvxhc-infected plants. however, mutations introduced highly
conserved "ptk" "kitc" motifs hc-pro, known involvement in
protein/protein interaction aphid-mediated transmission potyvirus, 
resulting change amino acid residue lysine (k) glutamic acid (e) in
the "kitc" motif obvious influence.
