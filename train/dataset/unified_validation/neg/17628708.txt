hepatocyte apoptosis important feature liver injury hepatitis c virus
(hcv) infection. however, mechanism apoptosis consequences disease 
progression vivo investigated fully part due lack of
adequate small animal models. study, transgenic (tg) mice produced
that express conditionally hcv structural proteins (core, e1, e2 p7) the
liver following cre-mediated dna recombination. using novel cre-estrogen
receptor fusion protein (cre-er) induction strategy, tamoxifen injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.), induced cre nuclear translocation, transgene
recombination hcv protein expression liver. hepatic expression hcv 
core envelope proteins resulted increased hepatocyte apoptosis, detected
by tunel assay, 7 33 days induction. results were
confirmed presence increased levels apoptosis-associated cytokeratin
18 (ck-18) sera animals. presence cleaved caspase-3 and
elevated levels chop/gadd153 liver suggests endoplasmic reticulum
(er) stress-associated apoptosis mechanism. study suggests vivo
correlation hcv structural protein expression, er stress hepatocyte
apoptosis, implicating potentially important mechanism hcv pathogenesis.
