key biological properties high genetic diversity high evolutionary
rate enhance potential certain rna viruses adapt emerge.
identifying viruses properties natural hosts could
dramatically improve disease forecasting surveillance. recently, we
discovered two novel members viral family arteriviridae: simian
hemorrhagic fever virus (shfv)-krc1 shfv-krc2, infecting single wild red
colobus (procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) kibale national park, uganda.
nearly nothing known biological properties shfvs nature,
although shfv type strain, shfv-lvr, caused devastating outbreaks of
viral hemorrhagic fever captive macaques. detected shfv-krc1 and
shfv-krc2 40% 47% 60 wild red colobus tested, respectively. found
viral loads excess 10(6)-10(7) rna copies per milliliter blood plasma
for viruses. shfv-krc1 shfv-krc2 also showed high genetic
diversity inter- intra-host levels. analyses synonymous and
non-synonymous nucleotide diversity across viral genomes revealed patterns
suggestive positive selection shfv open reading frames (orf) 5 (shfv-krc2
only) 7 (shfv-krc1 shfv-krc2). thus, viruses share several
important properties rapidly evolving, emergent rna
viruses.
