background: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (cspgs) principal pericellular 
and extracellular components form regulatory milieu involving numerous
biological pathophysiological phenomena. diverse functions cspgs be
mainly attributed structural variability polysaccharide moieties,
chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (cs-gag). comprehensive understanding of
the regulatory mechanisms cs biosynthesis catabolic processes is
required order understand functions.
scope review: here, focus recent advances study enzymatic
regulatory pathways cs biosynthesis including successive
modification/degradation, distinct cs functions, disease phenotypes have
been revealed perturbation respective enzymes vitro vivo.
major conclusions: fine-tuned machineries cs production/degradation are
crucial functional expression cs chains developmental and
pathophysiological processes.
general significance: control enzymes responsible cs
biosynthesis/catabolism potential target therapeutic intervention for
the cs-associated disorders.
