of morphogenesis].

[article russian]

krylov vn, zhazykov izh.

a description structure bilogical properties new virulent
pseudomonas phage, phikz, given paper. phage phikz unique
characteristics particle (a large size head presence the
head structure visible electron micrographs crosswise
striated substance). cause high-titer phage phikz formation plates has
been investigated. characteristics single step growth experiments, sensitivity
of free phage particles heating, sds-treatment, uv-light, cycles of
freezing-thawing, osmotic shocking determined. exclusion found of
homologous phage early stages infection bacteria phikz. mutants of
phikz changed plaque morphology isolated; possibility a
recombination mutants demonstrated. supposed phage
phikz may used excellent model study genetic control of
morphogenesis packing dna phage head.
