ueda y, tagaya i.

the immunological role vaccinia-soluble early antigen examined rabbits.
the antigens prepared hela cells infected conditional lethal
mutant vaccinia virus, induces cells early antigens including
those responsible surface immunofluorescence infected cells, viral
dna late protein syntheses. immunization rabbits antigens in
freund's complete adjuvant induced complement-fixing antibody neither
detectable circulating neutralizing antibody detectable level of
inhibitory substance interferon skin animals. immunized
animals inoculated intradermally vaccinia virus, multiplication of
virus skin greatly inhibited, accompanied earlier
appearance well accelerated wane local reactions. resistance 
could transferred passively serum immunized animals normal
rabbits. immunization rabbits antigens without adjuvant 
failed inhibit but, contrariwise, enhanced multiplication intradermally
inoculated vaccinia virus, inducing heavy skin lesions exalted virus
multiplication.
