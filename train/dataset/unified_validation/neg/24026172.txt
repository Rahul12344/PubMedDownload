key message: using high-resolution mapping approach, identified candidate 
gene zymv resistance cucumber. findings assist development 
of high-versatility molecular markers mas zymv resistance. zucchini
yellow mosaic virus (zymv) causes significant disease, leads fruit yield
loss cucurbit crops. since zymv resistance often inherited recessively in
cucumber, marker-assisted selection (mas) useful tool development of
resistant cucumber cultivars. using 128 families f2:3 population derived
from cross susceptible 'cs-pmr1' resistant 'a192-18' cucumber
inbred lines, confirmed zymv resistance conferred single
recessive locus: zym (a192-18) . constructed cucumber genetic linkage map
that included 125 simple sequence repeat (ssr) markers segregating 7 linkage
groups (chromosomes). zym (a192-18) locus mapped chromosome 6, at
genetic distances 0.9 1.3Â cm two closely linked ssr markers. for
high-resolution genetic mapping, identified new molecular markers
cosegregating zym (a192-18) locus; using cucumber genomic molecular 
marker resources screening f2 population 2,429 plants, narrowed down
the zym (a192-18) locus <50-kb genomic region flanked two ssr markers,
which included six candidate genes. sequence analysis candidate genes'
coding regions revealed vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein
4-like (vps4-like) gene two snps parental lines. based snps of
the vps-4-like gene, developed zym (a192-18) -linked dna markers found
that genotypes associated markers correlated zymv
resistance phenotype 48 cucumber inbred lines. according data, gene
encoding vps4-like protein candidate zym (a192-18) locus. these
results may valuable mas zymv resistance cucumber.
