sequence polymorphism hiv type 1 env gene quite high, little 
data available subtype c env gp41 sequences india. presented a
molecular sequence analysis gp41 region env gene hiv type 1 subtype
c-infected individuals. samples obtained 3 acute seroconverters and
5 seropositive individuals india, one minor. heteroduplex
mobility analysis using v3v5 gp41 confirmed subtype c infection the
study subjects. sequences analyzed heterogeneity, polymorphism, 
epitope recognition. phylogenetic simplot analysis showed the
monophyletic lineage indian sequences. phylogenetic tree constructed for
the 286- 506-bp region highly variable clearly distinguishes the
subtype c sequences. interpatient sequence comparison revealed high genetic
diversity ranging 0.0623 2.18 (median, 0.119). supports the
phylogeny sequences belonging 8 study subjects form subclusters
within indian subtype c. majority functional domains gp41 well
conserved seroconverter seropositive sequences. however, sequence
polymorphism high sequences obtained minor. sequences 
gp41 would provide valuable information regarding diversity its
diagnostic implications hiv/aids research.
