cholangiopathies share common features, including bile duct proliferation,
periportal fibrosis, intrahepatic cholestasis. damage biliary epithelium
by autoimunne disorder, virus infection, toxic compounds, developmental
abnormalities causes severe progressive hepatic disorders responsible high
mortality. however, etiologies cholestatic diseases remain unclear
because useful models study pathogenic mechanisms available. in
the present study, found ezrin knockdown (vil2(kd/kd) ) mice develop
severe intrahepatic cholestasis characterized extensive bile duct
proliferation, periductular fibrosis, intrahepatic bile acid accumulation
without developmental defects bile duct morphology infiltration of
inflammatory cells. ezrin membrane cytoskeletal cross-linker protein, 
is known interact transporters, scaffold proteins, actin cytoskeleton
at plasma membrane. found normal apical membrane localizations of
several transport proteins including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (cftr), anion exchanger 2 (ae-2), aquaporin 1 (aqp1), na(+) /h(+)
exchanger regulatory factor disturbed bile ducts vil2(kd/kd) mice.
stable expression dominant negative form ezrin immortalized mouse
cholangiocytes also led reduction surface expression cftr, ae-2,
and aqp1. reduced surface expression transport proteins accompanied 
by reduced functional expression, evidenced fact cells exhibited 
decreased cftr-mediated cl(-) efflux activity. furthermore, bile flow biliary
hco3 (-) concentration also significantly reduced vil2(kd/kd)
mice.conclusion: dysfunction ezrin mimics important aspects the
pathological mechanisms responsible cholangiopathies. vil2(kd/kd) mouse
may useful model exploit development testing potential
therapies cholangiopathies.
