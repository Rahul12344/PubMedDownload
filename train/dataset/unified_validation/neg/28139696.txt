three enzymes soil bacteria pantoea ananatis. lycopene present at
undetectable levels chloroplasts non-infected leaves. tissues infected
with viral vector, however, lycopene comprised approximately 10% total
carotenoid content. research showed plant viruses express

illustrating potential viral vectors engineering complex metabolic
