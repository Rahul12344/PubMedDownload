portal vein thrombosis (pvt) common complication cirrhosis. aim of
this study determine risk factors pvt, assess efficacy of
anticoagulant therapy, evaluate effects pvt patients cirrhosis
undergoing elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tipss). a
total 101 patients cirrhosis undergoing elective tipss prospectively
studied. tipss, patients received preventive therapy pvt were
followed 3, 6, 12, 24 months. clinical outcomes compared between
patients developed pvt tipss not. multivariate
analysis showed white blood cell count (relative risk [rr]: 0.377; 95%
confidence interval [ci]: 0.132-0.579; p = .001), child-turcotte-pugh score (rr: 
1.547; 95% ci: 1.029-2.365; p = .032), ascites (rr: 1.264; 95% ci:
1.019-1.742; p = .040) independent predictors pvt. warfarin treatment
within 12 months achieved significantly higher rates complete recanalization
than aspirin clopidogrel patients pvt (54.5% vs 31.3%; p = .013),
although adverse events similar 2 groups ( p > .05). patients
without pvt significantly lower 2-year cumulative rates variceal
rebleeding (15.9% vs 36.6%; p = .023), shunt dysfunction (27.0% vs 46.8%; p =
.039), hepatic encephalopathy (24.1% vs 42.6%; p = .045), hepatocellular
carcinoma (11.4% vs 31.2%; p = .024) markedly higher 2-year cumulative
survival rates (89.8% vs 72.9%; p = .041) pvt. pvt is
associated poorer clinical outcomes tipss-treated patients, warfarin 
is safe effective recanalizing pvt aspirin clopidogrel.
