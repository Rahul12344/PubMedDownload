human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) infection associated adult
t-cell leukemia htlv-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.
inhibition htlv-1 transmission important prevent above
htlv-1-associated diseases. used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) 
complementary first splice junction, rex responsive site, gag, env, tax,
rex, p21 evaluated effects syncytium formation htlv-1 
producing human t-cell line, c9/pl cells, htlv-1-uninfected human glioma cell
line, u251-mg cells. syncytium formation significantly inhibited the
virion production assayed antisense oligos env, tax, gag, p21, rex,
with antisense oligo env inhibitory. antisense oligos env
and tax also inhibited reverse transcriptase activity. antisense oligo env may
have potential preventive measure htlv-1 replication transmission
in vivo.
