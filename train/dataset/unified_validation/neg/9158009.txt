lymphoreticular malignancies, collectively called posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorders (ptld), eventually develop 2-5% organ
transplant recipients. frequently undergo regression immunosuppression 
is reduced stopped. feature associated previous de
novo epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection. herein describe immunotherapy with
autologous lymphokine-activated killer (lak) cells seven patients ptld
(four ebv-positive patients three ebv-negative patients). autologous
peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained leukapheresis, depleted of
monocytes, cultured presence interleukin 2 10 11 days. a
single dose 5.2 x 10(9) 5.6 x 10(10) lak cells given intravenously.
systemic interleukin 2 administered. four patients ebv+ ptld had
complete tumor regression; two developed controllable rejection. three
patients well 13-16 months treatment; fourth patient died of
pneumonia 41 days infusion. three patients ebv- lymphomas no
response despite prior evidence tumors also subject immune
surveillance. two three patients died given treatment,
and third patient persistent tumor. conclusion, autologous lak cell
infusion effective treatment four ebv+ organ transplant recipients.
lak cell efficacy three patients ebv- ptld evaluable the
management circumstances treatment utilized.
