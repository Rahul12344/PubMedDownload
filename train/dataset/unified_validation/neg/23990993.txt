rotavirus (rv) common cause severe diarrhea among infants and
young children. currently, specific drug available rotavirus,
largely due lack ideal target molecule hampered drug
development. previous studies revealed cyclosporin (csa) might be
potentially useful anti-rv drug. therefore used cellular mouse 
models study immunological safety effectiveness csa anti-rv
drug. found csa treatment ht-29 cells before, during, viral 
infection efficiently inhibited wa strain rv replication restored ifn-β
expression ht-29 cell line model. exploring underlying mechanisms showed
that csa promoted interferon regulatory factor-5 (irf-5) expression (a key
positive regulator type ifn signaling pathway), irf-1, irf-3, or
irf-7. additionally, csa inhibited socs-1 expression (the key negative regulator 
of ifn-α/β), socs-2 socs-3. antiviral effect csa confirmed 
in rv-infected neonatal mouse model evaluation antigen clearance and
assessment changes intestinal tissue pathology. also, differences t
cell frequency proliferation csa- vehicle-treated groups 
observed. thus, vitro vivo findings suggest csa, 
modulating expression key regulators ifn signaling pathway, promote
type ifn-based intracellular innate immunity rv host cells. findings
suggest csa may useful candidate develop new anti-rv strategy,
although evaluation characterization csa rv-induced diarrhea
are warranted.
