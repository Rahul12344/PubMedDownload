the 2013-2016 west africa outbreak demonstrated epidemic potential ebola
virus highlighted need counter strategies. monoclonal antibody
(mab)-based therapies hold promise treatment options ebola virus
infections. however, production clinical-grade mabs labor intensive, and
immunity short lived. conversely, adeno-associated virus (aav)-mediated mab
gene transfer provides host genetic blueprint manufacture mabs in
vivo, leading steady release antibody many months. demonstrate
that aav-mediated expression nonneutralizing mab 5d2 7c9 confers 100%
protection mouse-adapted ebola virus infection, neutralizing mab
2g4 83% protective. 2-component cocktail, aav-2g4/aav-5d2, provided
complete protection administered 7 days prior challenge partially
protective 3-day lead time. finally, aav-mab therapies provided sustained 
protection challenge 5 months following aav administration. aav-mab may a
viable alternative strategy vaccination emerging infectious diseases.
