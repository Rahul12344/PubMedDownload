virus production newly developed microcarrier system.

primary cell cultures well established lines grown recently 
developed microcarrier configuration overcomes problem toxicity
attendant earlier developments technology. virus yields these
cells propagated new microcarriers measured. microcarrier-grown 
cells, compared roller-bottle-grown cells, gave virus yields a
per-cell basis varied slightly greater sindbis virus-chinese
hamster ovary cells polio-wi-38 combinations approximately one-third 
moloney murine leukemia virus-cl-1 mouse cells vesicular stomatitis
virus-chicken embryo fibroblasts. yields ranged 8.0 x 10(7) 3.6 x 10(8)
cells per 100-ml microcarrier culture 3.7 x 10(7) 4.1 x 20(8) cells
per roller-bottle culture. secondary chicken embryo fibroblast yields were
approximately four times great microcarrier cultures standard
roller-bottle cultures, per unit volume medium consumed. spite the
reduced virus yields per cell seen instances, greater cellular
productivity microcarrier cultures appears hold great promise for
large-scale virus production. optimizing microcarrier conditions specific
cell-virus systems result improved yields.
