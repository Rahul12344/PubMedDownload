structure-function analysis hepatitis c virus (hcv) envelope
glycoproteins, e1 e2, difficult due unavailability hcv
virions. truncated soluble forms e2 used models study virus
interaction putative hcv receptor cd81, may fully mimic e2 
structures virion. here, compared cd81-binding characteristics of
truncated e2 (e2(660)) full-length (fl) e1e2 complex expressed mammalian
cells, hcv virus-like particles (vlps) generated insect cells. all
three glycoprotein forms interacted human cd81 vitro binding assay,
allowing us test panel well-characterized anti-e2 monoclonal antibodies
(mabs) ability inhibit glycoprotein-cd81 interaction. mabs
specific e2 amino acid (aa) regions 396-407, 412-423 528-535 blocked
binding cd81 antigens tested. however, mabs specific regions
432-443, 436-443 436-447 inhibited interaction vlps, of
e2(660) fl e1e2 complex cd81, indicating existence structural 
differences amongst e2 forms. findings underscore need carefully
select appropriate ligand structure-function analysis.
