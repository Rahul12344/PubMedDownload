oligonucleotide microarrays applied microbial surveillance and
discovery highly multiplexed assays required address wide range of
genetic targets. although printing density continues increase, design of
comprehensive microbial probe sets remains daunting challenge, particularly 
virology rapid sequence evolution database expansion confound static
solutions. here, present strategy probe design based protein
sequences responsive unique problems posed virus detection 
discovery. method uses protein families database (pfam) motif finding
algorithms identify oligonucleotide probes conserved amino acid regions and
untranslated sequences. silico testing using experimentally derived
thermodynamic model indicated near complete coverage viral sequence
database.
