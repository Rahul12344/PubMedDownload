this first multicenter, randomized, open-label study compare the
efficacy safety cyclosporine microemulsion (csa-me) (neoral, novartis,
basel, switzerland ) c2 monitoring versus tacrolimus de novo liver
transplant recipients. patients stratified according hepatitis c virus
status randomized receive csa-me (n= 250) tacrolimus (n= 245) with
steroids, without azathioprine. primary endpoint incidence of
biopsy-proven acute rejection (bpar) 3 months. secondary endpoints included
death graft loss safety evaluations 6 months. incidence bpar 
3 months 26% csa-me group 24% tacrolimus group (not
significant). 6 months, 89% patients receiving csa-me 88% patients
receiving tacrolimus alive functioning graft. among hepatitis c
virus-positive patients, difference bpar, death graft loss
was frequent receiving tacrolimus (15% vs. 6%, p <0.05). diabetes
mellitus (14% vs. 7%, p <0.02) diarrhea (29% vs. 14%, p <0.001) were
significantly often reported patients receiving tacrolimus. incidence
of hypertension similar groups. 6 months, median total
cholesterol 4.7 mmol/l (2.9-7.4 mmol/l) csa-me arm versus 4.3 mmol/l
(2.5-6.4 mmol/l) tacrolimus arm; median serum creatinine 106
micromol/l (52-238 micromol/l) csa-me arm versus 103 micromol/l (44-477
micromol/l) tacrolimus arm. efficacy equivalent csa-me using c2
monitoring tacrolimus liver transplant recipients. incidence adverse
events comparable except significantly higher incidence diabetes
mellitus diarrhea tacrolimus group. agents effective primary 
immunosuppressants liver transplant recipients.
