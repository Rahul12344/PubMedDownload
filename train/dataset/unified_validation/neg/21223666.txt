objective: analyze relationship influenza epidemic genetic
characteristic whole genome influenza virus subtype a/h3n2 strains
isolated zhejiang province 1998 2009.
methods: eight genes 19 zhejiang influenza virus isolates,
circulated 1998 2009, amplified rt-pcr sequenced. the
obtained sequences aligned analyzed vaccine strains used 
in last 10 years.
results: highest mutation happened within ha na genes amino acid 
divergent ratios 13.98% 10.00%. amongst six internal proteins, the
amino acid divergent ratios np, m2 ns1 6.43%, 6.19% 3.48%
respectively, others lower 3%. ha na genes, 
mutations also observed six internal genes strains isolated in
those years influenza virus subtype a/h3n2 widely circulating.
additionally, obvious genetic lag vaccine strains
recommended contemporary zhejiang epidemic strains many years.
conclusion: besides ha na genes, surveillance programs also be
covered mutations regarding internal genes influenza virus subtype a/h3n2 
strains, order provide important information forecasting warning of
a new round influenza epidemic.
