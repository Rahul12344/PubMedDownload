inflammation brain plays major role neurodegenerative diseases. in
particular, microglial cell activation believed associated the
pathogenesis neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson's disease (pd).
an increase microglia activation shown substantia nigra pars
compacta (snpc) pd models decrease tyrosine
hydroxylase (th) positive cells. may sign neurotoxicity due to
prolonged activation microglia early late stages disease
progression. natural products, spirulina, derived blue green algae, 
are believed help reverse effect due its
anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant properties. adeno-associated virus vector
(aav9) α-synuclein injected substantia nigra rats model
parkinson's disease study effects spirulina inflammatory
response. one month prior surgeries, rats fed either diet enhanced with
spirulina control diet. immunohistochemistry analyzed unbiased
stereological methods quantify lesion size microglial activation. as
hypothesized, spirulina neuroprotective α-synuclein model pd as
more th+ neun+ cells observed; spirulina concomitantly decreased the
numbers activated microglial cells determined mhcii expression. this
decrease microglia activation may due, part, effect of
spirulina increase expression fractalkine receptor (cx3cr1) on
microglia. study hypothesize α-synuclein neurotoxicity is
mediated, least part, via interaction microglia. observed a
decrease activated microglia rats received spirulina- enhanced
diet concomitant neuroprotection. increase cx3cr1 groups that
received spirulina, suggests potential mechanism action.
