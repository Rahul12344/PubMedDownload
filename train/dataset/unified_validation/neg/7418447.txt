trypsinized human embryonic fibroblasts placed suspension culture demonstrated
a distinct sequence changes topography underlying surface in
the nature distribution processes. 4 h typical cell showed a
rippled surface protruded small 'blebs' several microvilli. 
this appearance similar displayed confluent monolayer
cultures fibroblasts. fibroblasts survived suspension least 8 h 
and, topography appeared revert normal, suspended cells may prove 
a reasonable system studying early alterations surface appearance 
metabolism fibroblasts following addition various agents, including
viruses, provided allowed 4 h recover trypsin.
