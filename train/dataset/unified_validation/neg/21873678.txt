purpose: determine whether small gtpase rap1 regulates formation and
maintenance retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cell junctional barrier.
methods: vitro model used study rpe barrier properties. dissect
the role rap1, two techniques used inhibit rap1 function:
overexpression rapgap, acts negative regulator endogenous rap1
activity, treatment engineered, adenovirally-transduced micrornas to
knockdown rap1 protein expression. transepithelial electrical resistance (ter)
and real-time cellular analysis (rtca) impedance used readouts for
barrier properties. immunofluorescence microscopy used visualize
localization cadherins steady state conditions also during
junctional reassembly calcium switch. finally, choroidal endothelial cell
(cec) migration across rpe monolayers quantified conditions rap1
inhibition rpe.
results: knockdown rap1 inhibition activity rpe reduces ter and
electrical impedance rpe monolayers. loss barrier function also 
reflected mislocalization cadherins formation gaps within the
monolayer. ter measurement immunofluorescent staining cadherins a
calcium switch indicate junctional reassembly kinetics also impaired.
furthermore, cec transmigration significantly higher rap1-knockdown rpe
monolayers compared control.
conclusions: rap1 gtpase important regulator rpe cell junctions, 
required maintenance barrier function. observation rpe
monolayers lacking rap1 allow greater transmigration cecs suggests possible 
role potentiating choroidal neovascularization pathology of
neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
