in study, describe interaction araçatuba virus (arav), a
naturally occurring brazilian vaccinia virus isolated outbreak dairy
farm, host cell's signal transduction pathways. even though arav
infection led phosphorylation mapks mek/erk, jnk, p38mapk, genetic or
pharmacological inhibition pathways impact viral replication. 
we also provide evidence arav stimulated phosphorylation akt (pkb) at
serine 473 (s473-p), signaling event required full activation of
akt infectious cycle. furthermore, pharmacological inhibition pi3k 
(ly294002) abrogated arav-induced akt activation (s473-p) affected early 
late viral gene expression, followed decrease virus yield (~1
log). taken together, data shed light onto biological differences
between arav vaccinia virus strain wr (vacv-wr), could contribute, at
least part, low-virulence phenotype displayed arav. thus, 
requirement pi3k/akt pathway successful arav replication also
shared vacv-wr cowpox virus strain br (cpxv-br), arav showed lower
replicative capacity, well smaller plaque-size phenotype infection 
of a31 cells compared vacv-wr.
