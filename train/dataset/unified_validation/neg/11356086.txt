helper-dependent (hd) adenoviral vectors devoid viral coding sequences
have large cloning capacity reported provide long-term
transgene expression vivo negligible toxicity, making attractive
vectors gene therapy. currently, efficient means generating hd
vectors involves co-infecting 293 cells expressing cre hd vector a
helper virus bearing packaging signal flanked loxp sites. cre-mediated
excision packaging signal renders helper virus genome unpackageable
but still able replicate provide helper functions hd vector
propagation. hd vector titer increased serial co-infections. typically,
helper virus contamination < =1% pre- < =0.1% postpurification by
cscl banding. contamination levels low, reduction is
desirable. alternative methods selection helper virus may achieve 
this goal, especially combined cre/loxp. describe development of
a system generating hd vectors based site-specific recombination between
frt sites catalyzed flp recombinase show direct comparison the
flp/frt cre/loxp systems equivalent respect hd vector
amplification efficiency helper virus contamination levels. availability a
second recombinase system hd vector production enhance utility and
flexibility hd vectors.
