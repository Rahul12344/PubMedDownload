an ultrastructural study made sendai virus induced heterokaryons derived
from theileria parva-infected lymphoblasts ehrlich ascites tumour cells. when
fusion occurred, parasites successfully integrated cytoplasm the
resulting heterokaryons appeared morphologically normal
macroschizonts. homokaryon formation also noted. occurred frequently
between ehrlich ascites tumour cells rarely lymphoblasts. small
proportion heterokaryons contained altered forms parva showing nuclear
components, vesicular structures paired organelles similar the
microshizont stage parasite.
