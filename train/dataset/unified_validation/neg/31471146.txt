background: vaccination provides protection infection inducing vnas
mainly rabv surface gp. measurement vnas rabv commonly used 
to assess level immunity humans animals vaccination. vna
titer  ≥ 0.5 iu/ml sera indicates adequate response vaccination. here,
we report development validation rabv gp serology elisa kit for
semi-quantitative measurement vna titers sera vaccinated human subjects.
methods: using recombinant rabv gp expressed mammalian cells capture 
antigen, elisa method established using humab nm57 reference initially
and hrig reference subsequently. limit detection (lod), linear range,
reproducibility, precision method examined. specificity and
sensitivity established assess diagnostic accuracy.
results: rabv gp elisa plate coating optimal dilution human serum
sample 1 µg/ml 1:20, respectively. multiple assays carried by
different technicians different laboratories assay standardization. using 
the hrig reference, lod found 0.02-0.06 iu/ml linear range 
was 0.2-10.0 iu/ ml. inter-assay cvs range 6.60-10.79%,
indicating reproducibility. none 12 known negative human sera, tested 
positive elisa, highlighting specificity. total 415 unknown positive 
human sera double-blind tested rffit elisa. vna titer cut-off
value elisa set 1.5 iu/ml ensure false-positive. diagnostic
specificity sensitivity 100% 91.1%, respectively.
conclusions: validation data characterize elisa suitable method for
semi-quantitative measurement vna titers human serum samples assess
vaccination status. elisa kit offer simplicity, speed, low cost high 
throughput, making practical tool monitoring immune response
following vaccination.
