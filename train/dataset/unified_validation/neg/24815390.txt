granzyme 3 (gr3) known tryptase-type member granzyme family and
exists granules immunocompetent cells. granule proteases including
granzymes, transported cytoplasm tumor cells virus-infected
cells perforin function, degrade cytoplasmic nuclear proteins and
subsequently cause death target cells. recently, although several
substrates gr3 vivo reported, hydrolyzed sites unclear
or lacked consistency. previous study investigated optimal amino acid
triplet (p3-p2-p1) substrate gr3 using limited combination amino
acids p2 p3 positions. present study, new fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (fret) substrate libraries screen p2 p3
positions synthesized, respectively. using substrate libraries, the
optimal amino acid triplet shown tyr-phe-arg substrate human
gr3. moreover, kinetic analyses also showed synthetic substrate
frets-yfr lowest km value human gr3. substantial number membrane
proteins possessed triplet tyr-phe-arg might vivo
substrates gr3. results might also great help preparing specific
inhibitors manipulate gr3 activity vitro vivo.
