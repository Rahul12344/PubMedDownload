despite availability prophylactic vaccines human papillomavirus
(hpv), cervical cancer (cc) still major problem globally. cancer
with second highest incidence third highest mortality women
worldwide, but, less developed countries, even greater problem 
the second common cause cancer death. although hpv infection one of
the common sexually transmitted diseases, high-risk hpv16 most
frequent genotype involved, small number hpv-infected women develop
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions whereas, remainder the
women, virus disappears spontaneously. lot evidence support 
the view host-dependent immunologic status hpv-induced immune evasion
are responsible persistent hpv infection subsequent development of
cervical neoplasia. therefore, role immune system, viral
clearance also tumor antigen recognition, particularly relevant 
case cervical carcinogenesis. better understanding processes would 
help development therapeutic vaccines. review aims explain
which immune cells molecules involved process viral tumor
recognition, failure lead cervical carcinoma the
main therapeutic strategies far tested preclinical models clinical
trials stimulate immune system cervical carcinoma.
