the spodoptera exigua (hübner) multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (semnpv) is
currently tested biological insecticide use greenhouse crops in
southern spain. performed study semipurified semnpv occlusion
bodies (obs) formulated phosphate-buffered saline, ph 6.5, 5%
(vol:vol) glycerol 0.15% (wt:vol) sorbic acid, stored -20,
4, 25 degrees c 18 mo. initial aerobic counts (+/-se) averaged 1.4
(+/-0.17) x 10(7) colony-forming units/ml 17-h incubation 37 degrees c. 
aerobic counts microorganisms contaminated ob formulations stored 250c
decreased markedly period study, whereas small decreases
were observed counts obs stored 4 -20 degrees c. principal
microbial contaminants ob suspensions enterococcus spp.,
enterobacteriaceae, yeasts. potential human pathogens (salmonella, shigella, 
and vibrio species) detected, populations staphylococcus aureus
and bacillus cereus extremely low. compared newly formulated obs, the
estimated ld50 values obs stored 25 degrees c increased >16,666-fold
over 18 mo storage, whereas ld50 values greatly affected by
storage 4 -20 degrees c. significant changes time ob concentrations
were observed 25 degrees c treatment. complete degradation viral
dna observed 25 degrees c refrigerated frozen obs. we
conclude ob formulation bacteriostatic antioxidant additives,
together storage distribution refrigerated conditions, likely
result semnpv biopesticide shelf life exceeds 18 mo.
