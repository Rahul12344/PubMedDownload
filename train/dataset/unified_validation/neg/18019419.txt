several 3-formylchromone derivatives examined tumor
cell-cytotoxic, anti-helicobacter pylori, urease inhibitory anti-hiv
activity. comparing relative cytotoxicity four human tumor cell
lines three normal human cells, tumor cell-specific cytotoxicity detected
in 3-formylchromone derivatives. clear-cut relationship between
the cytotoxicity chemical structures compounds.
6,8-dichloro-3-formylchromone (fc10) showed comparable anti-h. pylori activity
with metronidazole potent urease inhibition jack bean urease. 
other hand, 6,8-dibromo-3-formylchromone (fc11) exhibited potent inhibitory
activity urease, anti-h. pylori activity. chromones
(fc1-16) exhibited anti-hiv activity.
