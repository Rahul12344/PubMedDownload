a high global burden rotavirus disease unresolved challenges 
marketed rotavirus vaccines, particularly developing world, ignited
efforts develop virus-like particle (vlp) vaccines rotavirus. while
rotavirus-like particles comprising multiple viral proteins difficult to
process, modular vlps presenting rotavirus antigenic modules promising
alternatives reducing process complexity cost. study, integrated
molecular bioprocess engineering approaches used simplify the
production modular murine polyomavirus capsomeres vlps presenting a
rotavirus 18 kda vp8* antigen. single construct generated dual
expression non-tagged murine polyomavirus capsid protein vp1 modular vp1
inserted vp8*, co-expression escherichia coli. co-expressed proteins 
assembled pentameric capsomeres e. coli. selective salting-out
precipitation polishing size exclusion chromatography step allowed the
recovery stable modular capsomeres cell lysates high purity, and
modular capsomeres successfully translated modular vlps assembled 
in vitro. immunogenicity study mice showed modular capsomeres vlps
induced high levels vp8*-specific antibodies. results demonstrate a
multipronged synthetic biology approach combining molecular bioprocess
engineering enabled simple low-cost production highly immunogenic modular 
capsomeres vlps presenting conformational vp8* antigenic modules. this
strategy potentially provides cost-effective production route modular
capsomere vlp vaccines rotavirus, highly suitable manufacturing
