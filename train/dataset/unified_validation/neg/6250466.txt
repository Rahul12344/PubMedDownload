tunicamycin (0.5 microgram/ml) significantly lowers (2 3 log10) infectious
yield herpes simplex virus type 1 grown chicken embryo fibroblasts in
bsc1 cells. although virus particles formed synthesis viral
deoxyribonucleic acid partially affected antibiotic, the
glycosylation herpesvirus glycopeptides amost completely inhibited. the
morphology virus particles made presence tunicamycin similar to
that intact virus particles, demonstrated electron microscopy. this
suggests absence carbohydrate side-chain viral
glycopeptides affect overall integrity virion decreases
very significantly infectivity particles.
