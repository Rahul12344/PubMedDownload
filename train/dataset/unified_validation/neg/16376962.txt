human papillomaviruses (hpvs) previously shown adsorb cultured
cells via membrane-associated heparan sulfate (hs) alpha6 integrin. we
demonstrate cultured keratinocytes uniquely secrete component the
basal extracellular matrix (ecm) function adsorb hpv particles which
can internalized adherent cells. uncharacterized basal ecm
adsorption receptor secreted normal human epidermal keratinocytes (nhek)
and four keratinocyte-derived cell lines examined, by
non-keratinocyte cell lines. multiple hpv types bound preferentially this
keratinocyte-specific receptor membrane-associated receptor, binding
to basal ecm adsorption receptor refractory inhibition heparin.
like membrane-associated receptor, basal ecm component functional as
an adsorption receptor vitro infection model using hpv-11. unlike
particle adsorption, however, successful infection hpv-11 virions remained
sensitive pretreatment virions heparin. secreted basal ecm
receptor colocalize antibodies hs, perlecan, alpha6
integrin, colocalized antibody laminin-5, marker of
keratinocyte ecm abundant component basement membrane mucosa and
skin. findings suggest model natural infections hpv virions,
nonspecifically adsorbed hs suprabasal keratinocytes throughout an
epithelial wound, might transferred mitotically active migrating
keratinocytes via intermediate association ecm secreted these
cells reestablish basement membrane.
