an electrochemical genosensor based epoxy-phenanthroline-fe(iii)-nh2-ssdna 
layer detection rna derived avian influenza presented. the
biosensor preparation consists of: (i) modification gold electrodes with
aminoethanethiol, (ii) modification self-assembled monolayer of
aminoethanethiol 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10]-phenanthroline using "click"
chemistry, (iii) first step complexation fe(iii) by
5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10]-phenanthroline, (iv) second step complexation
of fe(iii) 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10]-phenanthroline, (v) immobilization 
the single stranded amino-dna probe via "click" chemistry epoxy amino
groups. interactions ssdna probe rna targets explored
with osteryoung square wave voltammetry. genosensor showed remarkable
detection limit 3 copies/µl (5 am) rna extracted a/swan/poland/305/06
(h5n1) containing fully complementary sequence. linear dynamic range this
sequence observed 3.0×103 3.0×105 [copies/µl]. rna extracted from
a/mallard/poland/446/09 (h7n7), containing non-complementary sequence,
generated much weaker response. moreover, developed genosensor allows to
distinguish rna present biological samples 2, 3 4 mismatches. 
biosensing approach become potential alternative tool detecting rna
samples biomedical research early clinical diagnosis avian influenza
viruses.
