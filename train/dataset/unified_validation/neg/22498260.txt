the availability infectious cdna clone prerequisite genetic
studies rna viruses. however, despite important improvement molecular
biology techniques last decades, obtaining clones often remains
tedious, time-consuming rather unpredictable. case potyviruses,
cdna clones frequently unstable due toxicity viral proteins
for bacteria. problem overcome inserting introns viral
sequence requires additional steps cloning process depends on
the availability suitable restriction sites viral sequence or
adjunction sites mutagenesis. homologous recombination yeast rather
than vitro restriction ligation used build infectious clones 
other viral constructs. paper describes how, using recombination yeast
and fusion pcr, infectious intron-containing clones obtained within few
weeks two strains watermelon mosaic virus (wmv, potyvirus), whereas
previous attempts using "classical" cloning techniques failed repeatedly.
using approach, intronless infectious clones two potyviruses,
zucchini yellow mosaic virus (zymv) papaya ringspot virus (prsv), were
obtained less two weeks.
