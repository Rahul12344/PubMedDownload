the burden hepatitis c virus genotype 4 (hcv-4) high africa east
mediterranean countries. previous reports estimate sustained virologic response
(svr) rates hcv-4 ∼20-70%. however, many studies limited by
different study designs small sample sizes. aim evaluate treatment
outcome host/viral factors svr hcv-4 patients treated pegylated
interferon ribavirin (peg ifn+rbv) systematic quantitative manner. a
comprehensive literature search medline embase 'genotype 4' was
conducted november 2013. abstracts american association study 
liver diseases, asian pacific study liver, digestive disease week, and
european association study liver 2012/2013 reviewed.
inclusion criteria original studies least 25 treatment-naive hcv-4
patients treated peg ifn+rbv. exclusion criteria coinfection hiv, 
hepatitis b virus, genotypes. effect sizes calculated using
random-effects models. heterogeneity determined cochrane q-test (p<0.05)
and statistic (>50%). included 51 studies (11 102 hcv-4 patients) the
primary analysis. pooled svr 53% [95% confidence interval (ci): 50-55%]
(q-statistic=269.20, p<0.05; i=81.43). subgroup analyses, svr was
significantly associated lower viral load, odds ratio (or) 3.05 (ci:
1.80-5.17, p<0.001); mild fibrosis, 3.17 (ci: 2.19-4.59, p<0.001); and
favorable il28b polymorphisms, rs12979860 cc versus ct/tt, 4.70 (ci:
2.87-7.69, p<0.001), rs8099917 tt versus gt/gg, 5.21 (ci: 2.31-11.73,
p<0.001). hcv-4 patients treated peg ifn+rbv may expect svr rates ∼50%.
lower viral load, mild fibrosis, favorable il28b (rs12979860 cc rs8099917
tt) positively associated svr.
