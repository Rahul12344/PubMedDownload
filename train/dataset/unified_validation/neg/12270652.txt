highly sensitive specific diagnostic tools essential monitoring the
health status farmed species. development genomic probe
diagnostic systems 1990s, followed pcr-based systems, miniarray
method developed allowing one-step multiple detection. miniarray
method developed enable accessibility powerful array technology. to
use system, hybridisation washing process modified, resulting 
a significant increase test's rapidity sensitivity. miniarray
technology, hybridisation time reduced 20 min, whereas methods
require longer hybridisation time. hybridisation pcr product nylon 
membrane revelation hybrids antibody increase considerably the
ability pathogen's detection. first application developed the
diagnosis two specific viruses are, geographical range and
their impact production, important shrimp pathology, namely, the
white spot syndrome virus (wssv) infectious hypodermal hematopoietic 
necrosis virus (ihhnv).
