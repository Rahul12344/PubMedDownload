real-time pcr assays developed quantitative detection porcine
reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) porcine circovirus type 2
(pcv2). established real-time pcr quantitation prrsv cdna pcv2
dna found 9-log(10) linear dynamic range excellent
linearity reliable reproducibility. using techniques, distribution 
and quantitation prrsv pcv2 naturally infected challenged pigs were
investigated. viral concentrations expressed mean log(10) viral
dna cdna copy numbers per mg ml tested samples. pigs infected
naturally viruses, lung, spleen, tonsil lymphoid organs the
highest viral burdens ranges 5.73 8.38 5.65 6.91 prrsv
and pcv2, respectively. injection formalin-inactivated salmonella
choleraesuis emulsified complete freund's adjuvant 1 week the
inoculation viruses resulted prrsv replication enhancement 2 weeks
post-challenge. however, facilitated clearance prrsv 4 weeks
post-challenge. results study show established quantitative
pcr could useful tool applied vaccine development pathogenesis
studies future.
