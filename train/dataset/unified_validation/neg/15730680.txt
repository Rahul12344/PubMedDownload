objective: investigate influence local application cytotoxic
lymphocyte antigen 4-ig (ctla4-ig) adenovirus burn wound alloskin
grafting upon murine immune function.
methods: sixty balb/c mice randomly divided (operation control), b
(ctla4-ig transfection) c (normal control) groups, 20 mice each
group. skin wounds (full-thickness loss) sized 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm created on
the backs mice b groups. skin grafts size
obtained c57bl mice grafted skin wounds. 0.1 g of
cross-linking polyacrylic resin (carbomer cream) without adenovirus daubed
onto wounds group, amount carbomer cream adenovirus
in titers 5 x 10(9)/l daubed onto wounds b group, no
treatment given c group. 1 ml 10% srbc (sheep red blood cell) was
injected intraperitoneally mice three groups 1st post
injury day (pid). splenocytes balb/c, c57bl kunming mice harvested 
for mixed lymphocyte culture 7, 14, 21 28 pids. agglutination assay was
used time detect srbc antibody titers.
results: reaction murine splenocytes b group donor (c57bl)
splenocytes suppressed specific way (p < 0.05) within 14 pids. was
no difference titers anti-srbc antibody among 3 groups (p > 0.05).
conclusion: local application ctla4-ig recombinant adenovirus exhibited no
influence murine humoral immunity, might induce systemic specific 
t cell tolerance immunity system.
