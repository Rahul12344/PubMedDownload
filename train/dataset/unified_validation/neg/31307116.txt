aims: examine cost-effectiveness hepatitis c virus (hcv) treatment of
people inject drugs (pwid), combined medication-assisted treatment (mat)
and syringe-service programs (ssp), tackle increasing hcv epidemic 
united states.
design: hcv transmission disease progression models cost-effectiveness
analysis using health-care perspective.
setting: rural perry county, ky (pc) urban san francisco, ca (sf), usa.
compared pc, sf greater proportion pwid access mat ssp. 
hcv treatment pwid negligible settings.
participants: pwid data collected 1998 2015 social networks
among appalachian people, u find out, urban health study national hiv
behavioral surveillance system studies.
interventions comparator: three intervention scenarios modeled:
baseline-existing ssp mat coverage hcv screening treatment with
direct-acting antiviral ex-injectors per standard care;
intervention 1-scale-up ssp mat without changes treatment; and
intervention 2-scale-up intervention 1 combined hcv screening and
treatment current pwid.
measurements: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icers) uncertainty using
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. benefits measured in
quality-adjusted life-years (qalys).
findings: settings, intervention 2 preferred intervention 1 and
the appropriate comparator intervention 2 baseline scenario. relative 
to baseline, pc intervention 2 averts 1852 hcv infections, increases
qalys 3095, costs $21.6 million icer $6975/qaly. sf,
intervention 2 averts 36 473 hcv infections, increases qalys 7893, costs 
$872 million icer $11 044/qaly. cost-effectiveness of
intervention 2 robust several sensitivity analysis.
conclusions: hepatitis c screening treatment people inject drugs,
combined medication-assisted treatment syringe-service programs, a
cost-effective strategy reducing hepatitis c burden united states.
