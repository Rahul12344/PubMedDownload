blood cell counts, differential blood cell counts weights spleen and
peripheral lymph nodes draining area lesions induced moloney sarcoma
virus inoculation quadriceps shank muscles inbred balb/c mice were
examined various stages tumor development regression. blood cell
count remained constant observation period 27 days post tumor
development regression. differential counts revealed changes the
cellular composition peripheral blood. pronounced increase
of neutrophiles stage tumor development, decline tumour 
regression. enlargement spleen popliteal lymph nodes
draining tumour site, peak tumor development day 13 post msv
inoculation, involved least doubling splenic weight, much greater
weight increase lymph nodes. long-lasting, although declining
event, extending beyond tumor regression.
