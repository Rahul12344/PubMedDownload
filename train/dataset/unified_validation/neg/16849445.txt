memory cells mount enhanced response secondary infections. an
enhancement attributed part ability memory cells more
rapidly respond cognate stimulation. study examined the
rapidity murine cd8(+) memory cells respond localized infection
with hsv. although central memory cells (tcm), effector memory t
cells, mounted strong recall response secondary infection, kinetics of
tcm proliferation, magnitude expansion, infiltration 
infected nonlymphoid tissues advanced compared observed for
naive cells. findings imply lack accelerated
proliferation kinetics subsequent delayed dissemination the
periphery limits ability tcm rapidly control localized virus
replication.
