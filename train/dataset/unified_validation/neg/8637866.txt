a hela cdna expression library screened human polypeptides that
interacted poliovirus rna-dependent rna polymerase, 3d, using the
two-hybrid system yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. sam68 (src-associated in
mitosis, 68 kda) emerged human cdna that, fused transcriptional 
activation domain, gave strongest 3d interaction signal lexa-3d hybrid
protein. 3d polymerase sam68 coimmunoprecipitated infected human cell
lysates antibodies recognized either protein. upon poliovirus
infection, sam68 relocalized nucleus cytoplasm, poliovirus 
replication occurs. sam68 isolated infected cell lysates an
antibody recognizes poliovirus protein 2c, suggesting found on
poliovirus-induced membranes upon viral rna synthesis occurs. data,
in combination known rna- protein-binding properties sam68, make 
sam68 strong candidate host protein functional role poliovirus 
replication.
