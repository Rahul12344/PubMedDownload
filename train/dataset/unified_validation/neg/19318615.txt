human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) researchers often use calendar periods an
imperfect proxy highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) estimating 
the effect haart hiv disease progression. authors report 614
hiv-positive homosexual men followed 1984 2007 4 us cities. during
5,321 person-years, 268 614 men incurred acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,
49 died, 90 lost follow-up. comparing pre-haart calendar period
(<1996) haart calendar period (>or=1996) resulted naive rate ratio 
of 3.62 (95% confidence limits: 2.67, 4.92). however, estimate likely
biased misclassification haart use calendar period. simple
calendar period approaches may circumvent confounding indication cost
of inducing exposure misclassification. correct misclassification, the
authors propose instrumental-variable estimator analogous ones previously
used noncompliance corrections randomized clinical trials. the
pre-haart calendar period compared haart calendar period, the
instrumental-variable rate ratio 5.02 (95% confidence limits: 3.45, 7.31),
39% higher naive result. weighting inverse probability of
calendar period given age seroconversion, race/ethnicity, time since
seroconversion appreciably alter results. methods may help
resolve discrepancies observational randomized evidence.
