individuals. gain insight type occurrence oral lesions this
population, 25 hiv-1 infected women including asymptomatic, symptomatic aids 
patients examined clinically sampled detection oral yeast and
characterization subgingival microbial flora. sixty percent the
subjects african-american, 80% infected via heterosexual contact. oral 
candidiasis common nonperiodontal oral lesion, observed 44% of
the patients. oral yeast cultured women candidiasis 76% 
the total subjects. oral hairy leukoplakia clinically diagnosed 16% the
subjects. clinically mild moderate gingivitis periodontitis observed 
in 84% 52% patients, respectively. candidiasis presence of
cultivable yeast observed patients low, intermediate, high cd4+ 
t lymphocyte numbers. plaque samples collected subject and
enumerated predominant cultivable methods, selective media microscopy. 
differences detected microflora associated seropositive women
with existing periodontitis relative without periodontitis to
