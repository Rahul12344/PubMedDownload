the immune synapse (is) temporary interface antigen-presenting
cell effector lymphocyte. viral synapse molecularly organized
cellular junction structurally similar is. primary cilium is
considered functional homologue due morphological and
functional similarities architecture micotubule structures. it
has hypothesized endogenous electromagnetic field cell is
generated unique cooperating system mitochondria microtubules.
we extending prior hypothesis endogenous electromagnetic field in
the cell postulating polarized centriole immune viral synapse could
serve monopole antenna. addition hypothesis primary
cilium could serve monopole antenna. simulated distribution of
electric field centriole polarized centrosome monopole antenna in
immune viral synapse. weak electromagnetic field polarized centriole 
of cd8+ lymphocyte contribute transport cytolytic granules 
into attacked (cancer) cell. analogically, weak electromagnetic field of
polarized centriole viral synapse infected cd4 cells aid transport 
of viruses (human immunodeficiency virus) non-infected cd4 cells. we
hypothesized healthy organisms need monopole antennas. if, 
neoplastic transformation, healthy cells lose monopole antennas form of
primary cilia, aims replace monopole antennas polarized
centrioles restore homeostasis.
