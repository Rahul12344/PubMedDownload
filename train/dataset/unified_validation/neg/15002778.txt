both spatial heterogeneity exploiters (parasites predators) been
implicated key ecological factors driving population diversification. however,
it unclear factors interact. addressed question using the
common plant-colonizing bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens, shown
to diversify rapidly spatial niche-specialist genotypes propagated in
laboratory microcosms. replicate populations evolved spatially
homogeneous heterogeneous environments (shaken static microcosms,
respectively) without viral parasites (bacteriophage) approximately 
60 bacterial generations. consistent previous findings, exploiters reduced
diversity heterogeneous environments relaxing intensity resource
competition. contrast, exploiters increased diversity homogeneous
environments little diversification resource competition.
competition experiments revealed increase diversity result of
fitness trade-offs exploiter resistance competitive ability. 
environments, exploiters increased allopatric diversity, presumably result
of divergent selection resistance populations. phage increased total 
diversity homogeneous environments, net effect heterogeneous
environments. interactions key ecological variables need be
considered addressing diversification coexistence future studies.
