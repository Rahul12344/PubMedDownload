background: hiv prevention trials network (hptn) 046 trial evaluated the
efficacy extended infant nevirapine (nvp) administration prevention hiv
transmission breastfeeding. infants received daily nvp 6 weeks of
age. hiv-uninfected infants (the intent-to-treat group) received daily nvp or
placebo 6 months age. analyzed emergence nvp resistance infants
who acquired hiv infection despite prophylaxis.
methods: hiv genotyping performed using viroseq hiv genotyping system.
medians proportions used summarize data. two-sided fisher exact tests
were used evaluate associations categorical variables.
results: nvp resistance detected 12 (92.3%) 13 infants were
hiv-infected 6 weeks 7 (28%) 25 infants hiv-uninfected 6
weeks hiv-infected 6 months age (6/8 = 75% nvp arm, 1/17 = 5.9% 
in placebo arm, p = 0.001). among 25 infants, 4 mothers who
initiated antiretroviral treatment regimen 6 months postpartum. 4
cases, treatment regimen included non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (nvp efavirenz). nvp resistance detected 4 those
infants 6 months age (4/4 = 100%). contrast, 3 (14.2%) the
remaining 21 hiv-infected infants whose mothers initiate antiretroviral
treatment developed nvp resistance (p = 0.003).
conclusions: extended nvp prophylaxis significantly increased risk nvp
resistance infants acquired hiv infection 6 weeks age. treatment 
of maternal hiv infection also associated emergence nvp resistance in
hiv-infected, breastfed infants.
