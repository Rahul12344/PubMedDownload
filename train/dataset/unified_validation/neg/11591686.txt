a number transcriptional regulators mediate effects direct
contact sigma(70) subunit escherichia coli rna polymerase (rnap). 
particular, several regulators shown contact c-terminal portion of
sigma(70) harbors conserved region 4. region sigma contains a
putative helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif contacts -35 element of
sigma(70)-dependent promoters directly. report use recently
developed bacterial two-hybrid system study interaction the
putative anti-sigma factor rsd sigma(70) subunit e. coli rnap. using
this system, found rsd interact 86-amino-acid c-terminal
fragment sigma(70) also amino acid substitution r596h, within region 
4 sigma(70), weakens interaction. demonstrated specificity this
effect showing substitution r596h weaken interaction between
sigma two regulators shown previously contact region 4 sigma(70).
we also demonstrated algq, homolog rsd positively regulates
virulence gene expression pseudomonas aeruginosa, contact c-terminal
region sigma(70) subunit rnap organism. found amino
acid substitution r600h sigma(70) p. aeruginosa, corresponding the
r596h substitution e. coli sigma(70), specifically weakens interaction
between algq sigma(70). taken together, findings suggest rsd and
algq contact similar surfaces rnap present region 4 sigma(70) and
probably regulate gene expression contact.
