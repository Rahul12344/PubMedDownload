the respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) phosphoprotein (p) major polymerase
co-factor interacts large polymerase fragment (l) the
nucleoprotein (n). n-binding domain rsv p investigated by
co-expression rsv p n proteins escherichia coli. pull-down assays
performed series truncated forms p fused glutathione
s-transferase (gst) revealed region comprising last nine c-terminal 
amino acid residues p (233-dndlsledf-241) sufficient efficient binding 
to n. site-directed mutagenesis shows last four residues peptide
are crucial binding must present end flexible c-terminal
tail. presence p oligomerization domain (residues 100-160) an
important stabilizing factor interaction. tetrameric full-length p
fused gst able pull helical ring structures, whereas a
monomeric c-terminal fragment p (residues 161-241) fused gst pulled down
exclusively rna-n rings. electron-microscopy analysis purified rings
showed presence two types complex: undecamers (11n) decamers (10n).
mass-spectrometry analysis rna extracted rings rnase a
treatment showed two peaks 22,900 24,820 da, corresponding mean rna
length 67 73 bases, respectively. results suggest strongly each
