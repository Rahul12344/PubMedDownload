in present study investigated whether age-related changes the
composition functional properties murine cd4+ cells reflected in
vivo changed humoral response influenza vaccine aged mice. the
primary immunization, titers influenza-specific igm, igg1, igg2a, and
igg2b, igg3 ige, significantly reduced aged mice compared 
to young mice. treatment aged mice anti-ifn-gamma, anti-il-4, or
anti-il-10 resulted levels igm igg1 comparable found young 
mice, whereas igg2a igg2b decreased. booster
immunization ige significantly enhanced aged mice, whereas differences 
were observed regard isotypes. primary response in
young mice, anti-ifn-gamma stimulated igg1 ige, whereas inhibition of
igg2a, igg2b, igg3 observed. anti-il-4 caused decrease igg3
while anti-il-10 increased igm igg1 decreased igg2b igg3. 
primary response aged mice, anti-cytokine antibodies enhanced igm igg1
while ige enhanced anti-il-10. contrast, igg3 inhibited by
anti-ifn-gamma anti-il-10. anti-cytokine treatment young mice increased
all isotypes, except igg3, secondary response, whereas secondary
response aged mice largely insensitive anti-cytokine treatment. these
data therefore support idea vivo effects cytokines isotype 
switching dependent differentiation stage b cells may be
different young aged mice.
