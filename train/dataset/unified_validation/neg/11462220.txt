it may possible, one day, use gene therapy treat diseases whose genetic 
defects discerned. many genes responsible inherited eye
disorders within retina identified, diseases eye prime
candidates form therapy. eye also advantage being
highly accessible altered immunological properties, important considerations
for easy delivery virus avoidance systemic immune responses. currently,
adenovirus, adeno-associated virus lentivirus used successfully 
transfer genetic material retinal pigment epithelium photoreceptor cells. 
by harnessing therapeutic genes viruses, researchers able to
demonstrate rescue rodent models retinitis pigmentosa, providing evidence
that form therapy effective delaying photoreceptor cell death. 
future challenges include confirming therapeutic effects animal models with
eyes anatomically similar humans demonstrating long-term
rescue minimal toxicity.
