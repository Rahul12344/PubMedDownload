in 2009, novel swine-origin h1n1 influenza virus emerged. here, we
characterize multifunctional ns1 protein human pandemic virus in
order understand factors may contribute replication efficiency or
pathogenicity. although 2009 h1n1 virus ns1 protein (2009/ns1) an
effective interferon antagonist, found ns1 (unlike previous
human-adapted influenza viruses) unable block general host gene
expression human swine cells. property could restored 2009/ns1
by replacing r108, e125, g189 residues corresponding human virus
consensus. mechanistically, previously undescribed mutations acted by
increasing binding 2009/ns1 cellular pre-mrna processing protein
cpsf30. recombinant 2009 h1n1 influenza virus (a/california/04/09) expressing
ns1 gain-of-function substitutions efficient wild
type antagonizing host innate immune responses primary human epithelial
cells. however, mutations significant effect virus replication 
either human swine tissue culture substrates. surprisingly, mouse model
of pathogenicity, mutant virus appeared cause less morbidity, was
cleared faster, wild type. mutant virus also demonstrated reduced
titers upper respiratory tracts ferrets; however, contact aerosol
transmissibility virus unaffected. data highlight potential
human adaptation ns1 seems absent "classically derived" swine-origin
influenza viruses, including 2009 h1n1 virus. discuss impact
