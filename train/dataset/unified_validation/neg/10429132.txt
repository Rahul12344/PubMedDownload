objective: although numerous cardiac abnormalities reported in
hiv-infected children, precise estimates incidence cardiac disease in
these children well-known. objective report describe
the 2-year cumulative incidence cardiac abnormalities hiv-infected
children.
methodology:
design: prospective cohort (group i) inception cohort (group ii) study
design.
setting: volunteer sample 10 university public hospitals.
participants: group consisted 205 hiv vertically infected children enrolled 
at median age 22 months. group comprised infants children
already known hiv-infected time enrollment study. 
the children african-american hispanic 89% symptomatic hiv
infection enrollment. second group included 611 neonates born to
hiv-infected mothers, enrolled fetal life 28 days age (group 
ii). contrast older group children, group ii children were
enrolled hiv status ascertained.
interventions: according study protocol, children underwent series of
cardiac evaluations including two-dimensional echocardiogram doppler studies 
of cardiac function every 4 6 months. also 12- 15-lead surface
electrocardiogram (ecg), 24-hour ambulatory ecg monitoring, chest
radiograph every 12 months.
outcome measures: main outcome measures cumulative incidence an
initial episode left ventricular (lv) dysfunction, cardiac enlargement, and
congestive heart failure (chf). cardiac abnormalities tended cluster
in patients, also determined number children cardiac
impairment defined either left ventricular fractional
shortening (lv fs) </=25% 6 months age, chf, treatment cardiac
medications.
results: cardiac abnormalities: group children (older cohort), the
prevalence decreased lv function (fs </=25%) 5.7% 2-year
cumulative incidence (excluding prevalent cases) 15.3%. prevalence of
echocardiographic lv enlargement (lv end-diastolic dimension z score >2) the
time first echocardiogram 8. 3%. cumulative incidence lv
end-diastolic enlargement 11. 7% 2 years. cumulative incidence of
chf and/or use cardiac medications 10.0% group children. there
were 14 prevalent cases cardiac impairment (lv fs </=25% 6 months of
age, chf, treatment cardiac medications) group i. excluding
these prevalent cases, 2-year cumulative incidence cardiac impairment 
19.1% among group children 80.9% remained free cardiac impairment 
2 years follow-up. within group ii (neonatal cohort), 2-year cumulative
incidence decreased lv fs 10.7% hiv-infected children compared with
3.1% hiv-uninfected children. lv dilatation also common group 
ii infected versus uninfected children (8.7% vs 2.1%). cumulative incidence
of chf and/or use cardiac medications 8.8% group ii infected versus
0.5% uninfected subjects. 1- 2-year cumulative incidence rates of
cardiac impairment group ii infected children 10.1% 12.8%,
respectively, 87.2% free cardiac impairment first 2 years of
life.
mortality: group cohort, 2-year cumulative death rate all
causes 16.9% [95% ci: 11.7%-22. 1%]. 1- 2-year mortality rates 
the diagnosis chf (kaplan-meier estimates) 69% 100%, respectively. in
the group ii cohort, 2-year cumulative death rate causes 16.3%
[95% ci: 8.8%-23.9%] hiv-infected children compared deaths among
the 463 uninfected group ii children. two 4 group ii children chf
died 2-year observation period 1 died within 2 years the
diagnosis chf. 2-year mortality rate the
