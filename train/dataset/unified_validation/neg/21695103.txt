background: leishmania (viannia) parasites present particular challenges, as
human murine immune responses infection distinct leishmania
species, indicating unique interaction host. further, vaccination
studies utilizing small animal models indicate modalities antigens 
prevent infection leishmania species generally protective.
methodology: using newly developed mouse model chronic l. (viannia)
panamensis infection heterologous dna prime - modified vaccinia virus
ankara (mva) boost vaccination modality, examined whether conserved
vaccine candidate antigen tryparedoxin peroxidase (tryp) could provide protection
against infection/disease.
results: heterologous prime - boost (dna/mva) vaccination utilizing tryp antigen 
can provide protection disease caused l. (v.) panamensis. however,
protection dependent modulating innate immune response using tlr1/2
agonist pam3csk4 dna priming. prime-boost vaccination using dna alone
fails protect. prior infection protectively vaccinated mice exhibit
augmented cd4 cd8 ifnÎ³ memory responses well decreased il-10 and
il-13 responses. il-13 il-10 shown independently critical for
disease model. cd8 cells essential role mediating host
defense, cd8 depletion reversed protection vaccinated mice; vaccinated 
mice depleted cd4 cells remained protected. hence, vaccine-induced
protection dependent upon tlr1/2 activation instructing generation of
antigen specific cd8 cells restricting il-13 il-10 responses.
conclusions: given general effectiveness prime-boost vaccination, the
recalcitrance leishmania (viannia) vaccine approaches effective against
other species leishmania evident. however, prime-boost vaccination
modality modulation induce protective responses, indicating the
delivery system critical. moreover, results suggest cd8 cells
should targeted development vaccine infection caused by
leishmania (viannia) parasites. further, tlr1/2 modulation may useful in
vaccines cd8 cell responses critical.
