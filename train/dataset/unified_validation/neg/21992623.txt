background: human lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) causes chronic
inflammatory disease central nervous system known htlv-1-associated
myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (ham) resembles chronic spinal
forms multiple sclerosis (ms). pathogenesis ham remains uncertain. to
aid differential diagnosis ham identify pathogenetic mechanisms,
we analysed plasma proteome asymptomatic htlv-1 carriers (acs), patients
with ham, uninfected controls, patients ms. used surface-enhanced
laser desorption-ionization (seldi) mass spectrometry analyse plasma
proteome 68 htlv-1-infected individuals (in two non-overlapping sets, each
comprising 17 patients ham 17 acs), 16 uninfected controls, 11
patients secondary progressive ms. candidate biomarkers identified by
tandem q-tof mass spectrometry.
results: concentrations three plasma proteins--high [β2-microglobulin],
high [calgranulin b], low [apolipoprotein a2]--were specifically associated
with ham, independently proviral load. plasma [β2-microglobulin] was
positively correlated disease severity.
conclusions: results indicate monocytes activated contact with
activated endothelium ham. using β2-microglobulin calgranulin b alone we
derive diagnostic algorithm correctly classified disease status
(presence absence ham) 81% htlv-1-infected subjects cohort.
