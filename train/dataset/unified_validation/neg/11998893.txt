adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma (atl) distinct clinicopathological entity,
i.e., peripheral t-lymphocytic malignancy caused human t-lymphotropic virus
type (htlv-1) diverse clinical features. high frequency genetic
instability (gin) aggressive indolent atl detected comparative
genomic hybridization (cgh). among gin, chromosomal instability, i.e.,
ancuploidy, indolent atl frequent less complex dynamic as
compared aggressive atl. cgh alterations, including gain 
of 14q32, appear rather atl specific. clonal instability htlv-1-infected
t cells. i.e., emergence distinct clone, detected one forth of
acute crisis indolent atl cgh southern blotting htlv-1. taking
together previous reports frequent subtle mutations several tumor 
suppressor genes aggressive atl, gin multistep leukemogenesis atl is
diverse including clonal, chromosomal, nucleotide levels.
