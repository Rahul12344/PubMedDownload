we partially characterized interaction 125i-labeled surface proteins 
of staphylococcus aureus, obtained thermal extraction, purified plasma
membranes uninfected influenza virus a/fm/1/47-infected madin-darby
canine kidney cells. radioactivity profile surface-labeled proteins,
derived anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed mixture
of acidic polypeptides peak contained approximately 5% total
protein injected; adsorption purified plasma membranes reduced radioactivity
by 5 7% altered elution profiles. using direct adhesin overlay
procedure, found surface-labeled proteins reacted polypeptides
located external surface plasma membranes shared both
virus-infected uninfected cells unique virus-infected cells. our
data may help explain enhanced adherence s. aureus influenza virus
a-infected cells vitro.
