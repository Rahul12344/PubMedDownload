several studies demonstrated bk virus (bkv) jc virus (jcv)
establish latent infection peripheral blood leukocytes (pbls) healthy
individuals; however, main populations studied european. study,
the prevalence bkv jcv dna pbls healthy adult individuals and
umbilical cord blood newborn children china detected semi-nested
polymerase chain reaction (snpcr) followed restriction enzyme analysis. the
results suggest healthy adult chinese population harbors bkv jcv dna
in peripheral leukocytes. overall, prevalence bkv jcv dna pbls of
healthy adult individuals 42.1% 7.8%, respectively. overall
prevalence bkv dna significantly higher jcv dna. none 
umbilical cord blood samples newborn children positive bkv jcv 
dna. understand target tissues involved establishment bkv
and jcv latency healthy individuals, presence dna viruses was
detected normal arterial wall samples 20 young trauma victims same
method used leukocyte dna. bkv dna detected alone 20% samples
tested; jcv dna detected alone samples. dna both
viruses found 5% samples. first report show normal 
arterial walls healthy individuals may another target site latency for
bkv jcv.
