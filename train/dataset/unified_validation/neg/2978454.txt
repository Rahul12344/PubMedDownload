samples peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbmc) serially obtained 30
patients herpes zoster (hz) 10 patients chickenpox (cp). cells were
assayed nk-cell function expression surface membrane antigens 
which identify t-cell nk-cell subsets. acute phase disease
(less 7 days onset), pbmc patients hz low proportions 
t-helper (cd 4+) cells large number t-suppressor (cd 8+) cells,
resulting low t-helper/t-suppressor ratio. increased percentage
of nonspecific suppressor cells (gd 8+-cd 11+ cells) increased expression 
hla-dr determinants cd 8+ cd 4+ cells. nk activity depressed 
with concomitant decrease nk cells (cd 16+ leu 7+ cells). early
convalescing phase disease (8-14 days), significant increase cd
16+ cells increased expression hla-dr cells, correlating with
increased nk activity. late recovery phase (greater 14 days), nk
activity levels t-cell subpopulations normal exception of
increased cd 4+ cells and, consequently, helper/suppressor ratios. 
acute phase cp (less 7 days), t-cell imbalances similar those
encountered hz patients.(abstract truncated 250 words)
