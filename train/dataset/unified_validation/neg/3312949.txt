the crossover sites cin-mediated inversion consist imperfect 12 bp
inverted repeats non-palindromic dinucleotides center symmetry.
inversion believed occur vivo homologous central 2 bp
crossover sequences inversely repeated crossover sites through
introduction 2 bp staggered cuts subsequent reciprocal strand exchanges.
the site-specific cin recombinase acts normal crossover sites but
also, less efficiently, quasi crossover sites homology with
the normal sites. identified 15 new quasi sites including 4 sites within the
cin structural gene. homology 2 bp crossover sequences recombining
sites favors selection quasi crossover sites. cin enzyme occasionally 
mediate inversion nonidentical crossover sequences such
recombinations often result localized mutations including base pair
substitutions deletions within 2 bp crossover sequences. mutations 
are explained consequences heteroduplex molecules formed the
staggered dinucleotides either subsequent resolution dna replication
or subsequent mismatch repair. occasional utilization quasi crossover sites
and localized mutagenesis crossover sequences enzyme-mediated inversion
processes would one mechanisms contributing genetic diversity.
