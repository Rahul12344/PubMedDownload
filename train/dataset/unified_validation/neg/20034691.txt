murine norovirus-1 (mnv) currently suitable surrogate human
norovirus. mechanism mnv-1 inactivation high pressure processing (hpp) 
was investigated. hpp-treated mnv could bind target receptor and
therefore could initiate infection mouse raw cells. integrity the
capsid affect hpp. partial motif changes viral capsid caused by
hpp accessed induced sensitivity proteinase k.
