vision-threatening viral retinitis primarily caused members the
herpesvirus family. biology molecular characterization herpesviruses, 
clinical presentations retinopathies, pathology pathogenesis including the
host responses, epidemiology laboratory methods aetiological diagnosis
of diseases described. clinical syndromes acute retinal necrosis
(arn), progressive outer retinal necrosis (porn), cytomegalovirus (cmv)
retinitis, multifocal choroiditis serpiginous choroiditis besides viral
retinopathies. herpes simplex virus (hsv) retinitis common in
immunocompetent persons varicella zoster virus (vzv) affects both
immunocompetent immunosuppressed patients equally. cmv retinitis most
common among patients aids. currently employed laboratory methods of
antigen detection, virus isolation antibody detection enzyme linked
immuno-sorbent assay (elisa) low sensitivity. polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) increased value diagnosis due high clinical sensitivity
and absolute specificity detection herpesviruses intraocular specimens.
