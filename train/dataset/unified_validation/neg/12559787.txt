cytotoxic cell responses key control intracellular pathogens
including hiv-1. particular, hiv-1 vaccines based regulatory proteins, such
as tat, aimed controlling hiv-1 replication blocking disease
development inducing cytotoxic cell responses. naked dna capable of
inducing responses requires several inoculations high amounts of
dna, and/or prime-boost regimens. here, show novel class cationic
block copolymers protect dna dnase digestion, improve dna delivery
to antigen-presenting cells (apcs) intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination. in
particular, three cationic block copolymers (k1, k2 k5) used deliver 
the hiv-1 pcv-tat dna vaccine balb/c mice. results indicate that
vaccination low dose (1 microg) pcv-tat delivered cationic 
block copolymer k2 safe and, compared naked dna (up 30 microg),
greatly increases ctl response tat, detected animals
in absence presence re-stimulation.
