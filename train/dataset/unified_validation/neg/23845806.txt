background: streptococcus zooepidemicus important opportunistic pathogen of
the equine respiratory reproductive tracts. normal tonsillar mucosal
commensal, becomes invasive conditions stress virus
infection, weaning, high temperature, prolonged transportation failure of
uterine involution. aim study evaluate vaccine potential
of several surface exposed secreted proteins novel mucoid clone of
sznc78 (st-307) epizootic equine respiratory disease.
methods: expression gene library sznc78 probed pool of
convalescent equine sera clonal epizootic respiratory disease. eleven
proteins selected purified based putative function, surface
expression secretion possible importance virulence factors. three
additional proteins (ahpc, gapdh enolase) also included based their
putative virulence function. groups icr mice vaccinated subcutaneously
with recombinant antigen quila later challenged sznc78.
results: szm protected 100% mice (p<0.01), followed szp hylc which
protected 90% mice (p=0.01). map, szmac scpc protected 63% (p<0.05)
mice. control mouse survived challenge. szm, map scpc combination
protected mice 10 fold higher dosage sznc78 antigen given 
separately. protection heterologous challenge (szw60) conferred by
combinations hylc+scpc (60%; p=0.05), followed hylc+map (50%; p=0.06) and
scpc+map (40%; p=0.1). serum antibody responses horses recently recovered from
sz respiratory infection highest scpc, map szp. combination of
skc sz115 stimulated protection challenge szw60.
conclusion: subset sz proteins reactive convalescent equine antibody
have potential components experimental vaccines aid prevention of
opportunistic sz infections.
