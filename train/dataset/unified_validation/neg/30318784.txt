background purpose: kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (kshv) vil-6 
sufficient induce lymphatic reprogramming vascular endothelial cells, which
is key event kaposi's sarcoma (ks) development. study aimed to
investigate effect chinese herb oroxylin lymphatic reprogramming 
neovascularization kshv vil-6 vitro vivo.
methods: lymphatic-phenotype endothelial cell line generated by
lentiviral kshv vil-6 infection. cell viability apoptosis determined 
mtt assay flow cytometry annexin v/propidium iodide staining. migration, 
invasion, neovascularization vil-6-expressing lymphatic-phenotype
endothelial cells determined wound healing assay, transwell chamber
assay, microtubule formation assay, chick chorioallantoic membrane assay,
respectively. quantitative polymerase chain reaction western blot analysis
were used test expression prox1, vegfr3, podoplanin, lyve-1, pparγ 
in cells. co-localization prox1 pparγ determined by
immunofluorescence. ubiquitination prox1 detected vivo
ubiquitination assay.
results: lymphatic-phenotype endothelial cell line expressing kshv vil-6 
successfully generated. oroxylin induced cellular invasion abrogation,
apoptosis induction, neovascularization inhibition vil-6-expressing
endothelial cells. mechanically, oroxylin elevated pparγ expression, in
turn interacted facilitated prox1 undergo ubiquitinational
degradation, subsequently leads vegfr3, lyve-1, podoplanin reduction.
conclusion: modulating pparγ/prox1 axis, oroxylin inhibits lymphatic
reprogramming neovascularization kshv vil-6. thus, oroxylin may serve as
a candidate treatment ks well aggressive angiomas.
