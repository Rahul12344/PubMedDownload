we used triparental matings demonstrate transfer (mobilization) the
nonconjugative genetically engineered plasmid phsv106, contains the
thymidine kinase gene herpes simplex virus cloned pbr322, from
escherichia coli hb101 environmental isolate enterobacter cloacae in
sterile drinking water. first demonstration two-step
mobilization genetically engineered plasmid type fresh water,
including drinking water. transfer mediated r plasmid r100-1 e. coli
ed2149(r100-1). matings drinking water 15, 25, 35 degrees c yielded
recombinants, number increased increasing temperature. numbers 
of recombinants obtained 2 orders magnitude lower obtained
from matings trypticase soy broth. high concentrations parental organisms
(2.6 x 10(8) 2.0 x 10(9) cfu/ml) required. 1 week incubation in
drinking water, number parental organisms recombinants resulting from
mobilization remained constant absence indigenous organisms and
declined presence. using oligonucleotide probes cloned foreign
dna (thymidine kinase gene) plasmid vector dna (ampicillin resistance gene), 
we demonstrated genes transferred e. cloacae the
mobilization process. one recombinant selected detailed study, the
plasmids containing genes differed size forms phsv106
present e. coli hb101(phsv106), indicating dna rearrangement had
occurred. recombinant maintained plasmids unchanged form 15 days 
in drinking water. second rearrangement occurred serial passage 
recombinant selective media.(abstract truncated 250 words)
