viral capsid antigen (vca) iga one commonly tested antibodies 
epstein-barr virus (ebv) clinic proven biomarker predict the
risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) diseases. present, vca-iga 
antibody used clinical diagnosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa), detect samples qualitatively semi-quantitatively, with
unsatisfactory sensitivity specificity. study, indirect
time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (trfia) using eu(3+) labeled mouse anti-human iga
monoclonal antibodies tracer developed. method produced linear
range 0-30 au/ml, limit detection 0.018 au/ml. intra- and
inter-assay precisions 1.62-4.30% 3.56-7.57%, respectively. trfia showed
no cross-reactivity potentially interfering substances better
sensitivity specificity compared commercial elisa. study confirmed 
that indirect trfia meets requirement clinical testing could an
alternative detect vca-iga levels human serum clinic.
