epstein-barr virus (ebv) encodes several enzymes involved viral
dna replication. evidence viral proteins, themselves, can
induce immune dysregulation may contribute pathophysiology the
virus infection. study, focused ebv-encoded deoxyuridine
triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dutpase) present first evidence that
the dutpase able induce immune dysregulation vitro demonstrated by
the inhibition replication stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmcs) upregulation several proinflammatory cytokines including
tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-8, il-6, il-10 produced unstimulated pbmcs treated
with purified ebv-encoded dutpase. depletion cd14-positive cells (monocytes)
eliminated cytokine profile induced ebv dutpase treatment. data
support hypothesis least one protein ebv early antigen complex
can induce immune dysregulation may involved pathophysiology of
ebv-associated disease.
