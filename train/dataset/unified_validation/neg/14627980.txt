tumor suppressor p53 functions downregulated cervical cancers,
because product human papilloma virus (hpv) oncogene e6 binds and
inactivates p53 promoting degradation. p73, p53 homologue, similar to
p53 structure function yet degraded hpv e6 gene product. in
this study, developed replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus,
which expresses p73beta (ad-p73). infection human cancer cells ad-p73
results several fold increase p73beta levels well known target
genes like p21(waf1/cip1). ad-p73-infected cells showed reduced cellular dna
synthesis, arrest g1 phase cell cycle induction apoptosis. ad-p73
inhibited growth cancer cells different types. importantly, ad-p73
inhibited growth cell lines carrying hpv e6 gene, introduced 
stable integration, efficiently comparison ad-p53. furthermore,
ad-p73 also inhibited growth hela cells, cell line derived cervical
cancer, efficiently. ability ad-p73 inhibit growth hpv
e6-expressing cells hela cells correlated stable expression of
functional p73 presence e6. results suggest ad-p73 could 
used potential gene therapy agent cervical cancer.
