a study biochemistry type 3 poliovirus strains involves the
examination virus-coded polypeptides infected cells preparation
of oligonucleotide maps reported. polypeptide patterns shown 
relatively stable property virus strains distinguished sabin vaccine

deciding origin (vaccine nonvaccine) field isolates poliovirus.
oligonucleotide maps found sensitive indicators differences among
strains appear form basis determining genetic relationships among
strains. nucleotide maps two viruses isolated human cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis temporally associated administration of
attenuated vaccine suggested vaccine origin strain. one case the
nucleotide map indistinguishable vaccine strain.
