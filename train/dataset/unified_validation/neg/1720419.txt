the role individual amino acids binding human macaque antibodies were
determined human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gp41, residues
594-613, human antibodies hepatitis b (hb) virus core/e antigens
(hbc/eag), residues 121-140. decapeptides 9 amino acids (aa) overlap were
synthesised using rapid method simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis with
9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (fmoc) protection alpha-amino group the
aas. one coupling cycle including washing steps performed within 60-90 min.
the crude products analysed reversed-phase hplc pd-mass spectrometry.

thus, human recognition antigenic site overlaps reported t- the

approach obtain large numbers immunologically active peptides useful
for laboratories interested immunological characterisation of
