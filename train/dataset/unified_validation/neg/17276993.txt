t20 (fuzeon), novel anti-human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) drug, peptide 
derived hiv-1 gp41 c-terminal heptad repeat (chr). mechanism action
has yet defined. applied pepscan strategy determine the
relationship functional domains mechanisms action five 36-mer
overlapping peptides shift five amino acids (aa): chr-1 (aa 623-658),
c36 (aa 628-663), chr-3 (aa 633-668), t20 (aa 638-673), chr-5 (aa 643-678).
c36 peptide addition two aa n terminus c34. peptides chr-1
and c36 contain n-terminal heptad repeat (nhr)- pocket-binding domains. 
inhibited hiv-1 fusion interacting gp41 nhr, forming stable six-helix
bundles blocking gp41 core formation. peptide t20 containing partial nhr- and
lipid-binding domains, lacking pocket-binding domain, blocked viral fusion by
binding n- c-terminal sequences gp41 nhr cell membrane,
respectively. peptide chr-3, located middle c36 t20, 
overlaps >86% sequences two peptides, lacks pocket- and
lipid-binding domains, exhibited marginal anti-hiv-1 activity. results
suggest t20 c36 contain different functional domains, they
inhibit hiv-1 entry distinct mechanisms action. multiple functional
domains gp41 chr binding partners may serve targets rational 
design new anti-hiv-1 drugs vaccines.
