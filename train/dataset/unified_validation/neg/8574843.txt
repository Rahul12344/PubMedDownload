a hepatitis b virus (hbv) immune escape variant results substitution
of glycine arginine position 145 (arginine-145) immunodominant
neutralization epitope protein found infect one child a
seroepidemiologic survey 1,812 vaccinated children. child's mother a
younger brother also infected hbv variant, despite greater
than accepted level protective antibody (anti-hbv surface antigen) the
index child (30 miu/ml) brother (> 20,000 miu/ml). findings suggest
the perinatal horizontal transmission arginine-145 hbv variant from
mother child, ability variant propagate among the
