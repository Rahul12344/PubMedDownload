hepatitis b virus (hbv) causes acute chronic hepatitis b. local outbreaks of
hbv infections skilled nursing facilities matter growing concern in
developed countries. here, investigated two outbreaks hepatitis b that
recently occurred nursing homes germany. outbreak location was
associated acute fulminant hepatitis fatal outcome several cases,
while individuals infected location b developed asymptomatic mild hepatitis
b. sequence analysis viruses involved outbreaks revealed different,
but unique hbv strains location. strains produced high
viremia 10(9) virions/ml serum. found mild course of
hepatitis b location b caused circulating wild-type hbv genotype a2
strain, commonly found central europe. complete genome sequences of
isolates obtained infected patients revealed nearly 100% sequence identity
at nucleotide level well expression hbv e protein (hbeag), known t
cell tolerogen incubation chronic phases hbv infection. contrast,
the outbreak location associated hbv genotype d2 variant that
lacked hbeag expression, suggesting immunopathology selection of
specific hbv variants played major role severe (or even fulminant) acute
hepatitis observed location a. importantly, patients diagnosed with
type 2 diabetes mellitus, known risk factor healthcare-associated
transmission hbv. study leads us suggest that, besides strict adherence
to hygiene standards, additional efforts required reduce risk hbv
transmission fulminant disease progression healthcare settings nursing
homes. context, general screening hbsag active hepatitis b
vaccination considered people living nursing homes, especially
for diagnosed diabetes predisposing factors hbv
transmission.
