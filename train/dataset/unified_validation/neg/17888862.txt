background: influenza surveillance valuable monitoring trends in
influenza-related morbidity mortality. using 2005-2006 influenza season
as example, paper describes comprehensive influenza surveillance
program used california department public health (cdph).
methods: data collected patients evaluated acute respiratory illness 
a given week reported summarized following week, including (1)
electronic hospital pneumonia influenza admission antiviral usage records
from kaiser permanente, (2) sentinel provider influenza-like illness (ili)
reports, (3) severe pediatric influenza case reports (e.g., children either
hospitalized intensive care expired), (4) school clinic ili evaluations,
and (5) positive influenza test results network academic, hospital,
commercial, public health laboratories state cdph viral and
rickettsial disease laboratory.
results: influenza activity california 2005-2006 season moderate in
severity; clinical laboratory markers rose fell consistently.
extensive laboratory characterization identified predominant circulating
virus strain a/california/7/2004(h3n2), component 2005-2006
influenza vaccine; 96% samples tested showed adamantane resistance.
conclusions: using multiple, complementary surveillance methods coupled a
strong laboratory component, cdph developed simple, flexible, stable,
and widely accepted influenza surveillance system monitor trends in
statewide influenza activity, ascertain correlation circulating
strains vaccine strains, assist detection new strain variants.
the methods described serve model influenza surveillance other
states.
