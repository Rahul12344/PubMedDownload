insulin-like growth factor (igf)-i receptor activation leads enhanced
proliferation cell survival via map kinase phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-signaling pathways. upon stimulation igf-i, hdm2 oncoprotein is
phosphorylated akt, leading rapid nuclear translocation subsequent 
inhibition p53. show igf-i stimulation regulates nuclear
export hdm2 p53 via map kinase pathway. inhibition p38 mapk mek 
via pharmacological means expression dominant negative proteins inhibited
the cytoplasmic accumulation hdm2 increased hdm2 p53 protein levels,
whereas constitutively active p90rsk promoted nuclear export hdm2.
expression constitutively active p90rsk e1a, oncogenic h-ras, htert
resulted anchorage-independent growth normal human fibroblasts. our
findings link p90rsk-mediated modulation hdm2 nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling
with diminished ability p53 regulate cell cycle checkpoints that
ultimately leads transformation.
