even though gene therapy made way clinics treat number of
human pathologies since early years experimental research despite 
recent approval first gene-based product (glybera) europe, safe and
effective use gene transfer vectors remains challenge human gene therapy 
due existence barriers host organism. work active
investigation improve gene transfer systems themselves, use of
controlled release approaches may offer alternative, convenient tools vector
delivery achieve performant gene transfer vivo overcoming the
various physiological barriers preclude wide use patients. this
article provides overview significant contributions showing how
the principles controlled release strategies may adapted human gene
therapy.
