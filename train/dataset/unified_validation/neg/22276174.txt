adenovirus vector-based vaccine promising approach protect hiv infection.
however, recent phase iib clinical trial using vector show its
protective efficacy hiv infection. improve vaccine, explored
the transgene protein expression immunogenicity using optimized codon
usage, promoters adaptors. compared protein expression immunogenicity 
of adenovirus vector vaccines carrying native codon usage-optimized hiv-1
clade c gag env genes expression cassettes driven different promoters
(cmv, cmvi, ca promoters) adapters (ires f2a). adenovirus vector 
vaccine containing optimized gag gene produced higher gag protein expression 
induced higher immune responses vector containing native gag gene in
mice. furthermore, ca promoter generated higher transgene expression elicited
higher immune responses two popularly used promoters (cmv cmvi).
the second gene expression using f2a adaptor resulted higher protein
expression immunity using ires direct fusion protein. taken 
together, adenovirus vector containing expression cassette ca
promoter, optimized hiv-1 clade c gene f2a adaptor produced best
protein expression elicited highest transgene-specific immune responses. 
this finding would promising vaccine design gene therapy.
