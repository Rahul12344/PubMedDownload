children dccs. serum- and- plasma samples obtained 
401 (55%) 730 participating children detection hhv-6 antibodies
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), viral dna amplification through
the nested-pcr. recent hhv-6 infection diagnosed 63.8% (256/401) them, 
as defined presence igm igg-specific antibodies (igm+/igg+);
of these, 114 (44.5%) symptomatic 142 (55.5%) symptoms (p =
0.03). subgroup 123 (30.7%) children found igm-/igg+, whereas the
remaining 22 (5.5%) children neither igm igg hhv-6- antibodies
(igm-/igg-). 118 children reacting strongly igm-positive (> = 30 panbio
units), 26 (22.0%) found harbour hhv-6 dna, demonstrated by
nested-pcr. taken elisa-igm- and- nested pcr-positive results together, hhv-6
infection shown occurred 5 8 dccs follow-up.
serological evidence recent infections epstein-barr virus (ebv) and
parvovirus b19 identified 2.0% (8/401) 1. 5% (6/401) children,
