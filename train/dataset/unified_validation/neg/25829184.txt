stat4 signal pathway plays important role ifn-Î³-mediated antiviral
activity. recent studies show association stat4 polymorphisms with
hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. therefore investigated influence of
stat4 polymorphisms susceptibility spontaneous clearance hbv a
chinese han population. genomic dna 288 cases chronic hbv infection and
288 controls spontaneously recovered hbv infection analyzed five
snps stat4 gene (rs7574865, rs7572482, rs7582694 rs11889341, and
rs8179673).our analysis revealed minor alleles four snps
(rs7574865, rs7582694, rs11889341, rs8179673) association overall
decreased risk hbv infection [p = 0.040, 0.762 (95 % ci 0.593-0.981); p =
0.011, 0.686 (95 % ci 0.535-0.878); p = 0.023, 0.751 (95 % ci 0.586-0.962);
p = 0.002, 0.670 (95 % ci 0.521-0.861), respectively]. major alleles of
the four snps found associated increased risk hbv-related
cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma. furthermore, haplotype gggct
constructed five snps found highly significant association
with chronic hbv infection compared controls spontaneously
recovered hbv infection [p = 0.031, 1.368 (95 % ci 1.028-1.818)]. these
findings indicate stat4 minor allele may associated spontaneous 
clearance hbv, whereas major allele may associated progress of
the hbv-related liver disease.
