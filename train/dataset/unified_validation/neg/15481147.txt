cd83 best-known surface marker mature dendritic cells (dc) and
recently could show soluble form cd83 inhibits dc maturation. in
addition, soluble form inhibits dc-mediated cell proliferation vitro
and vivo. furthermore, several viruses induce cd83 degradation shedding 
infected dc. soluble form cd83 also found plasma serum healthy
individuals interestingly highly elevated levels number of
haematological malignancies. thus, cd83 also functional implications 
immune response. however, molecular mechanism well defined. we
describe first time soluble cd83 completely changed cytoskeleton
(analysed using phalloidin-, tubulin- fascin-specific antibodies) when
administered concentration 10 microg/ml mature dc. cells rounded
off short, truncated, veils all. furthermore, soluble
cd83-treated cells completely inhibited ability form clusters
with cells, absolute prerequisite order stimulate cells.
