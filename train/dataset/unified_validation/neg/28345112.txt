in recent past, direct-acting anti-viral drugs (daas) become standard of
care treatment hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. however, the
experience use drugs indian renal transplant recipients is
limited. retrospectively reviewed experience daa-based treatment 
hcv infection patients. april 2015 december 2016, six adults 
(median age 41 [range 34-52] years, male 5; gt1 2, gt3 3, gt4 1; including
three prior failed interferon-based treatment) received genotype-guided,
daa-based anti-hcv treatment 1 158 (median 15) months renal
transplantation. them, four completed planned 24-week treatment without
any significant adverse event. one increase serum creatinine after
16 weeks treatment sofosbuvir daclatasvir, acute interstitial
nephritis kidney biopsy; renal function improved stopping drugs.
the patient preexisting mild renal dysfunction, worsened after
8 weeks sofosbuvir-ledipasvir treatment; reverse stopping
treatment. six patients achieved undetectable hcv rna 4 weeks of
treatment also achieved sustained virologic response, i.e. lack detectable
hcv rna serum 12 weeks stopping treatment. overall, daa-based treatment 
was effective treating hcv infection renal transplant recipients;
however, caution monitoring renal function treatment is
advisable patients additional factors predispose renal
injury.
