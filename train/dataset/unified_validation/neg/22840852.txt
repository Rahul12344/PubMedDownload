background: patients atopic dermatitis (ad) history eczema
herpeticum increased staphylococcal colonization infections. however,
whether staphylococcus aureus alters outcome skin viral infection 
been determined.
objective: investigated whether aureus toxins modulated host response to
herpes simplex virus (hsv) 1 vaccinia virus (vv) infections normal human
keratinocytes (nhks) murine infection models.
methods: nhks treated aureus toxins incubation viruses.
balb/c mice inoculated aureus 2 days vv scarification. viral
loads hsv-1 vv evaluated using real-time pcr, viral
plaque-forming assay, immunofluorescence staining. small interfering rna
duplexes used knockdown gene expression cellular receptor of
α-toxin, disintegrin metalloprotease 10 (adam10). adam10 protein and
α-toxin heptamers detected using western blot assays.
results: demonstrate sublytic staphylococcal α-toxin increases viral
loads hsv-1 vv nhks. furthermore, demonstrate in vivo vv
load significantly greater (p < .05) murine skin inoculated an
α-toxin-producing aureus strain compared murine skin inoculated the
isogenic α-toxin-deleted strain. viral enhancing effect α-toxin is
mediated adam10 associated pore-forming property. moreover, we
demonstrate α-toxin promotes viral entry nhks.
conclusion: current study introduces novel concept staphylococcal
α-toxin promotes viral skin infection provides mechanism aureus 
infection might predispose host toward disseminated viral infections.
