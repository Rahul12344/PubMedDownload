phic31 integrase, site-specific recombinase, effectively mediate foreign
genes bearing attb sequence integrated pseudo attp sites. have
previously identified two pseudo attp sites, bpsf1 bpsm1 bovine
genome. study, two new pseudo attp sites, bf4 bf10, discovered
using half-nested inverse pcr cow fibroblasts. genomic locations of
these two pseudo attp sites identified direct sequencing blast
search, confirmed reside positions 4q31 10q35 by
fluorescence situ hybridization analysis. subsequently, distinct
integration frequencies four pseudo attp sites examined. bf4 site
was identified hotspot site-specific integration occurred of
the cell clones examined, accounting 74% (42/57) integration; much
more integration frequency bf10 (7%; 4/57), bpsf1 (7%; 4/57) and
bpsm1 (0/57). interestingly, similar hotspots identified human
and mouse genomes, transgenes integrated hotspots result high
expression, gfp gene integrated hotspot bf4 expressed high levels
in cow fibroblasts, confirmed fluorescence microscopy facs analysis.
furthermore, elisa showed expression level gfp gene integrated at
the bf4 site averaged approximately 328 microg x mg(-1), than
twofold higher integrated bf10 site. study suggests that
somatic cells carrying desired gene integrated bf4 site used as
nuclear donors generate valuable transgenic animals nuclear transfer.
