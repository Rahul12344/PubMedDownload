influenza virus a/seal/mass/1/80 (h7n7) mutants obtained; hemagglutinins
(has) mutants activated trypsin, wild-type virus,
but thermolysin. mutants grew efficiently multiple replication cycle
conditions formed plaques chicken embryo cells thermolysin was
added culture medium. exhibited hemolytic activity induced
protective immunity chickens asymptomatic course infection.
nucleotide sequencing ha gene direct amino acid sequencing showed that
insertion single leucine fusion peptide ha2 chain close to
the cleavage site shift cleavage site toward c terminus one
amino acid responsible changes biological properties the
thermolysin activation mutants. revertants could obtained trypsin or
trypsin-like endoproteases present virus-producing system.
