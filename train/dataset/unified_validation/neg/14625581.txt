we reviewed medical records 256 patients investigate frequency and
characteristics hemorrhagic cystitis (hc) associated reduced-intensity
stem cell transplantation (rist) opposed conventional stem cell
transplantation (cst); 137 patients underwent cst 119 rist. diagnosis hc
was made based two episodes sterile, macroscopic hematuria with
normal coagulation profiles, without evidence renal stones or
genitourinary malignancy. actuarial frequency hc development rist group was
7.6% (9/119), gave cumulative annual incidence 11.7%. cst group, 13
of 137 patients (9.5%) developed hc, giving estimated annual incidence of
9.7%. probability developing hc similar two groups
(p=0.77). viral etiologies hc, adenovirus (n=12) bk virus (n=2), 
documented eight patients rist six cst. hc milder and
of shorter duration, less blood transfusion requirements, rist group
than cst group. multivariate analysis revealed hc associated with
antiadenovirus antibody positivity recipients, total dose busulfan, and
chronic gvhd. although hc following rist less severe following cst, 
it still significant problem.
