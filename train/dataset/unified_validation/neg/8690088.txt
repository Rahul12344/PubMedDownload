the plum pox virus (ppv) protein ci rna helicase, whose function the
virus replication still unknown. recently, rna binding domain mapped to
a region ci protein includes arginine-rich motif vi typical of
rna helicases superfamily sf2. present study, second region
involved rna binding activity ci protein identified.
northwestern assays series maltose-binding protein fusions contain
different ci fragments showed rna binding domain located between
residues 75 143. segment contains two amino-terminal conserved 
domains rna helicases: i, involved ntp binding, ia, unknown
function. results explained context close interdependence 
between protein regions involved ntpase rna binding activities
that expected rna helicase.
