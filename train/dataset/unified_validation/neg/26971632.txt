hand, foot, mouth disease (hfmd) common infectious disease caused a
group human enteroviruses (hev), including coxsackievirus a16 (ca16) and
enterovirus 71 (ev71). recent years, another hev-a serotype, ca6 ca10, 
emerged one major etiologic agents induce hfmd worldwide.
the objective study develop specific, sensitive, rapid methods 
to help diagnose hev ca16 specifically using simultaneous amplification
testing (sat) based isothermal amplification rna real-time detection of
fluorescence technique, named sat-hev sat-ca16, respectively
(sat-hev/sat-ca16). specificity sensitivity sat tested here.
sat-hev/sat-ca16 could measure viral titers least 10-fold lower than
those measured real-time pcr. non-false cross-reactive amplification indicated
that sat-hev/sat-ca16 highly specific addition internal control 
(ic) rna (5000 copies/reaction). total 198 clinical specimens assayed
by sat comparing real-time pcr. statistically robust assessment of
sat-hev hev-specific real-time pcr plus sequencing reached 99.0% (196/198),
with kappa value 0.97, 99.5% (197/198) kappa value 0.99 for
ca16, respectively. additionally, ic prevented false-negative readings and
assured sat-hev/sat-ca16 method's accuracy. overall, sat-hev/sat-ca16 method 
may serve platform simple rapid detection hev/ca16 time of
hfmd outbreak.
