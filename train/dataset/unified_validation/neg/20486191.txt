the storage conditions blood samples reliable results important
in hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna amplification tests used routine hcv analyses. 
according many studies, storage conditions could affect rna stability 
hcv rna detection. studied hcv rna stability blood samples stored 4
degrees c. nineteen blood samples containing different hcv rna levels stored
at 4 degrees c analyzed taqman real-time pcr method. hcv
rna levels remained almost stable (100%) least five weeks storage 
condition. however, among them, stability period 11 weeks two of
the samples. findings, slightly significant correlation
between positivity time beginning hcv rna levels (r=0.474, p=0.040). 
we conclude that, blood samples stored 4 degrees c five weeks
without significant difference detected hcv rna level using taqman
real-time pcr.
