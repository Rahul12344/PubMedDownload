recognized one apc types. however, little known whether
functional heterogeneity processing presentation exist within the
monocyte/macrophage population. past difficulties obtaining clonal

the c-myc-containing retrovirus mrv, previously shown immortalize murine
macrophages, used generate large panel macrophage cell clones.

hybridoma specific observed among clones, variation correlated
with levels surface mhc class ii antigen clones expressed. in
contrast, diversity ability process present certain nominal
antigens among clones presented corresponding antigenic peptide with
similar efficiency appear due differences levels surface
