background: genetic polymorphisms toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) 
demonstrated play important role respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)
infections western populations, association tlr4 polymorphisms and
rsv infections investigated chinese patient populations. the
study presented identifies tlr4 polymorphisms investigates the
association tlr4 genetic polymorphism rsv infection chinese infant
patient population.
methods: one-hundred ninety-six infants hospitalized rsv infections 
311 healthy control subjects enrolled study. genetic polymorphisms
in 5' untranslated region (5'utr), exons, 3' untranslated region (3'utr) 
of tlr4 gene screened using pcr sequencing analysis. association
between genetic polymorphisms tlr4, rsv infection risk, related
disease severity investigated using fisher's exact test chi-square
test.
results: fourteen different genetic polymorphisms within tlr4 gene, including
two 5'utr, four exons, eight 3'utr found the
study population. two polymorphisms, asp299gly thr399ile, typically
associated rsv caucasian infants observed chinese
infants. 14 polymorphisms, rs41426344 (g/c) 3'utr tlr4 
gene found associated rsv infection risk disease severity.
conclusions: tlr4 genetic polymorphism rs41426344 may specific genetic
risk factor chinese infants associated rsv infection disease
severity.
