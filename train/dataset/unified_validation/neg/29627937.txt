background: gastric cancer lymphoid stroma (gcls) pathologically
characterized poorly developed tubular structures prominent lymphocytic
infiltration. clinical prognostic features differ patients positive
and negative epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection. study analyzed the
expression programmed cell death-1 (pd-1), programmed cell death ligand-1
(pd-l1), density tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils) including
cd3+ and cd8+ t cells, well prognostic significance patients 
gcls.
methods: study included 58 patients gcls (29 ebv+ 29 ebv-) who
underwent curative resection. expression cd3, cd8, pd-1, pd-l1 tumor
cells tils analyzed using quantitative multispectral imaging system
(opal™), results validated immuno-histochemical assays pd-l1 on
whole slide sections.
results: proportion tumors overexpressing pd-l1 (31.0 vs. 0%, p = 0.002), 
til density (4548 vs. 2631/mm2, p < 0.001), intra-tumoral cd8+ t-cell density
(2650 vs. 1060/mm2, p < 0.001) significantly higher ebv+ ebv-
gcls. addition, cd8+/cd3+ t-cell ratio higher ebv+ ebv- gcls
(55.3 vs. 35.8%, p < 0.001). lower til density, defined as < 1350/mm2, a
significant negative factor survival.
conclusions: despite histopathological similarity, quantitative multispectral
imaging revealed differences tumor immune micro-environment ebv+
and ebv- gcls, indicating underlying pathogenesis differs two
disease entities. til density may prognostic marker patients gcls.
