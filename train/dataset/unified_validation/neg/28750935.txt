background: cabotegravir rilpivirine antiretroviral drugs development 
as long-acting injectable formulations. latte-2 study evaluated long-acting
cabotegravir plus rilpivirine maintenance hiv-1 viral suppression 
96 weeks.
methods: randomised, phase 2b, open-label study, treatment-naive adults
infected hiv-1 initially received oral cabotegravir 30 mg plus
abacavir-lamivudine 600-300 mg daily. objective study to
select intramuscular dosing regimen based comparison antiviral
activity, tolerability, safety two intramuscular dosing regimens
relative oral cabotegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine. 20-week induction
period oral cabotegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine, patients viral
suppression (plasma hiv-1 rna <50 copies per ml) randomly assigned (2:2:1)
to intramuscular long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine 4-week intervals
(long-acting cabotegravir 400 mg plus rilpivirine 600 mg; two 2 ml injections) or
8-week intervals (long-acting cabotegravir 600 mg plus rilpivirine 900 mg; two 3 
ml injections) continued oral cabotegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine.
randomisation computer-generated stratification hiv-1 rna (<50 copies
per ml, yes no) first 12 weeks induction period. primary
endpoints proportion patients viral suppression week 32 (as
defined us food drug administration snapshot algorithm),
protocol-defined virological failures, safety events 96 weeks. all
randomly assigned patients received least one dose study drug during
the maintenance period included primary efficacy safety analyses.
the primary analysis used bayesian approach evaluate hypothesis the
proportion viral suppression long-acting regimen worse 
the oral regimen proportion 10% (denoted comparable) according 
prespecified decision rule (ie, posterior probability comparability >90%).
difference proportions associated 95% cis supportive primary
analysis. trial registered clinicaltrials.gov, number nct02120352.
findings: among 309 enrolled patients, 286 randomly assigned the
maintenance period (115 4-week 8-week groups 56 the
oral treatment group). study currently ongoing. 32 weeks following
randomisation, long-acting regimens met primary criteria comparability
in viral suppression relative oral comparator group. viral suppression was
maintained 32 weeks 51 (91%) 56 patients oral treatment group,
108 (94%) 115 patients 4-week group (difference 2·8% [95% ci -5·8 to
11·5] vs oral treatment), 109 (95%) 115 patients 8-week group
(difference 3·7% [-4·8 12·2] vs oral treatment). week 96, viral suppression
was maintained 47 (84%) 56 patients receiving oral treatment, 100 (87%) 
115 patients 4-week group, 108 (94%) 115 patients 8-week
group. three patients (1%) experienced protocol-defined virological failure (two 
in 8-week group; one oral treatment group). injection-site reactions
were mild (3648 [84%] 4360 injections) moderate (673 [15%] 4360
injections) intensity rarely resulted discontinuation (two [<1%] 230
patients); injection-site pain reported frequently. serious adverse
events maintenance reported 22 (10%) 230 patients the
intramuscular groups (4-week 8-week groups) seven (13%) 56 patients in
the oral treatment group; none drug related.
interpretation: two-drug combination all-injectable, long-acting
cabotegravir plus rilpivirine every 4 weeks every 8 weeks effective 
daily three-drug oral therapy maintaining hiv-1 viral suppression 96
weeks well accepted tolerated.
