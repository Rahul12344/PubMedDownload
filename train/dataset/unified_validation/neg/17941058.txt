hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection huh-7.5 hepatoma cells results focal
areas infection transmission potentiated cell-cell contact. to
define route(s) transmission, hcv allowed infect hepatoma cells 
presence absence antibodies neutralize cell-free virus infectivity.
neutralizing antibodies (nabs) reduced cell-free virus infectivity >95% and
had minimal effect(s) frequency infected cells culture. to
assess whether cell-cell transfer viral infectivity occurs, hcv-infected cells
were cocultured fluorescently labeled na√Øve cells presence absence
of nabs. enumeration flow cytometry demonstrated cell-cell transfer of
infectivity presence absence nabs immunoglobulins hcv(+)
patients. host cell molecule cd81 tight junction protein claudin 1
(cldn1) critical factors defining hcv entry. soluble cd81 anti-cd81
abrogated cell-free infection huh-7.5 partially inhibited cell-cell
transfer infection. cd81-negative hepg2 hepatoma cells resistant to
cell-free virus infection became infected coculturing jfh-infected
cells presence nab, confirming cd81-independent routes of
cell-cell transmission exist. experiments 293t 293t-cldn1
targets suggested cell-cell transmission dependent cldn1
expression.conclusion: data suggest hcv transmit vitro at
least two routes, cell-free virus infection direct transfer cells,
with latter offering novel route evading nabs.
