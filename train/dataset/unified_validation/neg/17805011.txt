theiler murine encephalomyelitis (tme) represents important mouse model of
multiple sclerosis. activator protein nuclear factor-kappab proteins are
interacting transcription factors controlling expression cytokines
involved demyelination process. however, specific expression patterns of
these transcription factors susceptible resistant mouse strains 
relationship demyelination remains determined. expression of
activator protein-1 (c-fos c-jun) nuclear factor-kappab (p50 p65)
genes, tme virus, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma was
investigated spinal cord tme virus (bean strain)-infected sjl/j and
c57bl/6 mice 196 days postinfection (dpi) using reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. additionally, c-fos, c-jun,
and p50 expression examined applying immunohistochemistry. susceptible 
sjl/j mice, contrast resistant c57bl/6 mice, investigated mrna
transcripts upregulated early (0-7 days dpi) late phases (28-196 
days dpi) tme. addition, white matter lesions sl/j mice were
characterized c-jun-positive astrocytes p50-positive mononuclear immune
cells. upregulation activator protein-1 nuclear factor-kappab resident 
glial cells early phase followed strong downstream tumor necrosis
factor-alpha production might account disease development susceptible
sjl/j mice. late phase, formation jun/jun homodimers in
intralesional astrocytes might contribute sustained release of
proinflammatory cytokines, thereby promoting disease progression.
