although clinical trials enterovirus type 71 (ev71) inactivated vaccine
have progressing, potential mechanism ev71 infection its
associated pathogenesis well-characterized terms comprehensive
analysis induced immune response, generally recognized an
important indicator safety vaccines. investigate th1/th2
response following viral challenge neonatal rhesus monkeys immunized with
different doses ev71 inactivated vaccines, variety different th1 and
th2 cytokines organs tissues monkeys identified. the
results suggest depending viral challenge, th1/th2 reaction
induced different doses ev71 inactivated vaccine varies. specifically,
there enhanced immune response 80eu- 1280eu-immunized monkeys,
whereas 320eu immunization induces mild response. although direct
impact variation immune protection induced vaccine, th1
reaction functions t-cell cytotoxicity, aid investigation
of pathogenic characteristics small pathological changes central
nerves system (cns) likely induced th1 response.
