human mouse samhd1 proteins block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
infection noncycling human monocytic cells reducing intracellular
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dntp) concentrations. phosphorylation human
samhd1 threonine 592 (t592) cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) cyclin a2 
impairs hiv-1 restriction activity, dntp hydrolase activity,
suggesting dntp depletion sole mechanism samhd1-mediated hiv-1
restriction. using coimmunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, identified and
validated two additional host proteins interacting human samhd1, namely,
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) s-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (skp2). 
we observed mouse samhd1 specifically interacted cyclin a2, cyclin b1, 
cdk1, cdk2. given role samhd1-interacting proteins cell cycle
progression, investigated regulation host proteins monocyte
differentiation activation cd4+ cells examined effect the
phosphorylation human samhd1 t592. results indicate primary
monocyte differentiation cd4+ t-cell activation regulate expression of
these samhd1-interacting proteins. furthermore, results suggest that, in
addition cdk1 cyclin a2, cdk2 phosphorylates t592 human samhd1 and
thereby regulates hiv-1 restriction function.importance: samhd1 first 
dntp triphosphohydrolase found mammalian cells. human mouse samhd1
proteins block hiv-1 infection noncycling cells. previous studies suggested
that phosphorylation human samhd1 threonine 592 cdk1 cyclin a2
negatively regulates hiv-1 restriction activity. however, unclear
whether human samhd1 interacts host proteins cyclin a2 cdk1
complex whether mouse samhd1 shares similar cellular interacting partners.
here, identify five cell cycle-related host proteins interact human 
and mouse samhd1, including three previously unknown cellular proteins (cdk2,
cyclin b1, skp2). results demonstrate several samhd1-interacting
cellular proteins regulate phosphorylation samhd1 play important role
in hiv-1 restriction function. findings help define role these
cellular interacting partners samhd1 regulate hiv-1 restriction
function.
