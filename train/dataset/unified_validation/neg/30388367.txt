high-efficiency target capture essential prerequisite sensitive
immunoassays. however, current available immunoassay approaches subject
to deficient binding affinities predator-prey molecules greatly
restrict target capture efficiency immunoassay sensitivity. herein, we
present new strategy self-assembly antigen proteins into
nanowires enhance binding affinity antigen antibody.
through genetic fusion antigen proteins (e.g., hiv p24) yeast
amyloid protein sup35 self-assembly domain, specific antigen nanowires (ag
nanowires) constructed demonstrated remarkable enhancement binding 
affinity compared monomeric antigen molecule. ag nanowires
were combined magnetic beads form 3d magnetic probe based 
seed-induced self-assembly strategy. taking advantage strong binding 
affinity rapid magnetic separation enrichment capacity, specific 
3d magnetic probe achieved 100-fold improvement detection sensitivity within
a significantly shorter period 20 min conventional
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.
