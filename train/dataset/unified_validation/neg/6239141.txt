characterization intracellular dna strand breaks induced neocarzinostatin
in escherichia coli cells.

boye e, k√∂hnlein w, skarstad k.

dna strand breaks induced neocarzinostatin escherichia coli cells been
characterized. radioactively labeled phage lambda dna introduced into
lysogenic host bacteria allowing phage dna circularize superhelical
molecules. drug treatment dna single- double-strand breaks were
measured independently neutral sucrose gradient sedimentation. presence
of alkali-labile lesions measured parallel alkaline sucrose gradients. 
the cell envelope provided efficient protection towards drug, since no
strand breaks detected unless cells made permeable toluene 
with hypotonic tris buffer. permeable cells, double strand breaks could 
detected, even high ncs concentration (100 micrograms/ml). induction of
single-strand breaks leveled 15 min 20 degrees c presence 
2 mm mercaptoethanol. exposure 0.3n naoh doubled number strand breaks. 
no enzymatic repair breaks could observed.
