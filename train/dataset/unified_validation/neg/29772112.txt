the hepatitis b virus chronically infects liver 250 million people
worldwide. past decades, major advances made the
understanding hepatitis b virus life cycle hepatocytes. beside these
parenchymal cells, liver also contains resident infiltrating myeloid
cells involved immune responses pathogens much less known about
their interplay hepatitis b virus. review, summarized and
discussed current knowledge role liver macrophages (including
kupffer cells liver monocyte-derived macrophages), hbv infection. it
is still unclear liver macrophages play role establishment and
persistence hbv infection, several studies disclosed data suggesting hbv 
would favour liver macrophage anti-inflammatory phenotypes thereby increase
liver tolerance. addition, alternatively activated liver macrophages might
also play long term key role hepatitis b-associated pathogenesis,
especially activation hepatic stellate cells. therapies aiming 
a transient activation pro-inflammatory liver macrophages therefore 
considered treatment chronic hbv infection.
