enterocyte turnover along proper epithelial barrier function crucial
aspects mucosal defense. apoptosis highly regulated type programmed
cell death allows homeostatic turnover epithelial layer.
recent studies suggested microbial modulation enterocyte apoptosis
can result increased epithelial permeability, leading gastrointestinal
pathophysiology. review, highlight key mechanisms pathways via
which various viral, bacterial parasitic pathogens able modulate
enterocyte apoptosis. also discuss alterations enterocyte
apoptosis result activation chronic gastrointestinal disorders,
such allergies, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) inflammatory bowel disease 
(ibd). role proteinase-activated receptors pathogenesis of
modulated apoptosis-induced pathogenesis also discussed. newly discovered
processes, host epithelial cells may evolved, rescue
mechanisms microbe-induced apoptosis discussed. together, these
mechanisms key ever-increasing understanding host-microbe
interactions gut.
