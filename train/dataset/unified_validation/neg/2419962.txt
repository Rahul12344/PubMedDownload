arrest daudi cell growth inactive influenza virus in-vitro.

weil-hillman g, zakay-rones z.

we investigated destructive capability three influenza strains,
victoria, pr8, recombinant x47, human lymphoma cell line
daudi. victoria x47 strains share envelope glycoproteins
(h3n2), pr8, second parental strain x47, differs envelope
glycoproteins (hon1). h3n2 strains particularly x47 recombinant 
cytotoxic daudi cells hon1 strain not. reduce virulence
of oncolytic viruses, inactivated either heat (56 degrees c/45
min) formalin. treatments significantly reduced infectivity of
the viruses. x47 virus treated formalin retained hemagglutinin (ha) 
and neuraminidase (na) activities lost cytotoxic potential. 
hand, heat-treated x47 virus retained ha activity, lost na activity, 
but preserved cytotoxic potential. thus, heat-inactivated x47 virus (x56)
was effective non-virulent oncolytic agent tested. x56 virus
arrested daudi cell multiplication in-vitro inhibiting cellular dna synthesis.
the mechanism x56 inhibited daudi cell dna synthesis related 
interferon induction daudi cells, necessarily involve the
activation epstein-barr virus (ebv) genome present daudi cells.
although mechanism remains unclear, oncolytic potential x56 virus 
on daudi cells demonstrated.
