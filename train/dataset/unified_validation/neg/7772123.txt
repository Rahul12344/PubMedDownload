chronic infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) regarded risk factor for
hepatocellular cancer, mostly patients liver cirrhosis. looked hcv

cirrhosis see whether hcv directly oncogenic. cancerous non-cancerous 
liver tissue, serum samples 19 patients negative hepatitis b surface
antigen analysed polymerase chain reaction presence hcv
genome, hcv replication, hcv genotyping, hbv genome. 13 19 patients were
hcv rna-positive cancerous non-cancerous liver tissue; 8 17 tested were
anti-hcv positive. among 13 hcv rna-positive patients, 11 genotype 1b and
2 genotype 2a. 7 13 serum samples hcv rna positive. 7 19 patients

anti-hbc positive. 4 patients hcv rna hbv dna positive 3 were
both hcv rna hbv dna negative. results provide evidence the
association hcv, mostly genotype 1b, hepatocellular cancer without the
intermediate step cirrhosis.
