the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) one epidemic
diseases threatening human health world. based clinical studies, 
sars-cov (the sars-associated coronavirus), novel coronavirus, reported as
the pathogen responsible disease. date, effective specific
therapeutic method used treat patients suffering sars-cov
infection. rna interference (rnai) process introduced small
interfering rna (sirna) could cause degradation mrna identical
sequence specificity. rnai methodology used tool silence
genes cultured cells animals. recently, technique employed 
anti-virus infections human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis c/b virus. in
this study, rnai technology applied explore possibility for
prevention sars-cov infection. constructed specific sirnas targeting 
gene sars-cov. demonstrated sirnas could effectively and
specifically inhibit gene expression spike protein sars-cov-infected cells.
our study provided evidence rnai could tool inhibition sars-cov.
