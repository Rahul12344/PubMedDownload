individual foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) strains reveal different degrees
of infectivity pathogenicity host animals. differences severity
among outbreaks might ascribable differences infectivity among
fmdv strains. investigate molecular mechanisms underlying these
differences, estimated infectivity o/jpn/2000 o/jpn/2010, which
caused outbreaks markedly different scales, cell lines, holstein cattle,
and suckling mice. viral growth two strains cells remarkably
different; however, o/jpn/2000 showed apparently low transmissibility cattle. 
mortality rates suckling mice inoculated intraperitoneally 50% tissue
culture infective dose (tcid50) 10 o/jpn/2000 o/jpn/2010 also
differed, 0% 100%, respectively. identify genes responsible this
difference infectivity, genetic regions full-length cdna o/jpn/2010 
were replaced corresponding fragments o/jpn/2000. total eight
recombinant viruses successfully recovered, suckling mice were
intraperitoneally inoculated. strikingly, recombinants either vp1 3d
derived o/jpn/2000 showed 0% mortality suckling mice, whereas other
recombinants showed 100% mortality. finding indicates vp1, the
outermost component virus particle, 3d, rna-dependent rna
polymerase, individually involved virulence o/jpn/2010.
three-dimensional structural analysis vp1 confirmed amino acid
differences two strains located mainly domain interacting
with cellular receptor. hand, measurement mutation
frequencies demonstrated o/jpn/2000 higher replication fidelity than
o/jpn/2010.importance efforts understand universal mechanism of
foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) infection may aided knowledge the
molecular mechanisms underlie differences virulence beyond multiple
topotypes serotypes fmdv. here, demonstrated independent genetic
determinants two fmdv isolates different transmissibility in
cattle, namely, vp1 3d protein. findings suggested selectivity of
vp1 host cell receptors replication fidelity replication were
important individual factors induction differences virulence

aid development safe live vaccines antivirals obstruct viral
