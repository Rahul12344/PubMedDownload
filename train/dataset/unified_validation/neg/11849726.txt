in paper, deal strategies surveys substantiate freedom
from disease certain territory. infection might distributed
homogeneously. so, relatively high within-herd prevalence might observed
while herd-level prevalence lower. situation, compare various 
two-stage sample strategies. calculation appropriate sample sizes becomes 
quite complicated. theoretical generalization hypergeometric
distribution cameron baldock [prev. vet. med. 24 (1998) 1] introduces a
simple way evaluate multi-stage sample sizes regarding real-test
properties. demonstrate theoretical foundations calculations.
these principles open possibility optimizing costs relevant
variables, choosing appropriate sample strategy (each ensures the
same alpha-level first stage). addition, evaluate statistical
power complete strategies consideration.furthermore, apply our
theoretical results data example brucella melitensis. used the
herd-size situation germany, characterized many small sheep holdings and
only large ones. consequences real-test properties sample sizes
and applicability several strategies discussed.
