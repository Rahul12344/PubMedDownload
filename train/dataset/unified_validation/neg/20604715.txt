objective: extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (eppi) key regulator of
pathologic mineralization articular cartilage. articular chondrocytes generate
eppi transportation intracellular ppi (ippi) transport
mechanisms ank degradation extracellular adenosine
triphosphate (eatp) ectoenzymes. although numerous modulators eppi have
been characterized, little known eatp elaboration cartilage. we
sought determine (1) whether eatp coordinately regulated eppi (2) 
whether ank transports atp.
methods: primary articular chondrocytes treated factors known to
modulate eppi levels including growth factors (tgfβ1 igf-1), anion channel
inhibitors, chemicals alter adenylyl cyclase protein kinase c
activities. additional chondrocyte monolayers infected adenovirus
containing functional (ad-ank) mutated (ad-ank mutant) ank sequences. eatp
levels measured bioluminescent assay.
results: tgfβ1 enhanced eatp accumulation 33%, whereas igf-1 decreased eatp
accumulation 63% attenuated tgfβ1-induced eatp release 72%. forskolin
and probenecid diminished eatp accumulation 55% 89%.
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate increased eatp 29%. transfection of
chondrocytes ad-ank caused 10-fold increase eatp compared control 
values.
conclusion: modulation eatp various factors paralleled effects on
eppi production, suggesting shared pathway eppi eatp production and
implicating ank eatp transport. eatp directly contributes pathologic
mineralization articular cartilage, understanding eatp regulation may lead 
effective therapies crystal-associated arthritis.
