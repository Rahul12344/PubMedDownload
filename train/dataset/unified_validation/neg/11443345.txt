a number molecular forms dna polymerases reported involved 
in eukaryotic nuclear dna replication, contributions alpha-, delta-,
and epsilon-polymerases. reported delta-polymerase possessed a
central role dna replication archaea, whose ancestry thought be
closely related ancestor eukaryotes. indeed, vitro experiment shown 
here suggests delta-polymerase potential ability start dna
synthesis immediately rna primer synthesis. therefore, question arises,
where alpha-polymerase come from? phylogenetic analysis based the
nucleotide sequence several conserved regions reveals two poxviruses,
vaccinia variola viruses, polymerases similar eukaryotic
alpha-polymerase rather delta-polymerase, adenovirus, herpes family
viruses, archaeotes eukaryotic delta-like polymerases, suggesting that
the eukaryotic alpha-polymerase gene derived poxvirus-like organism,
which eukaryote-like characteristics. furthermore, poxvirus's
proliferation independent host-cell nucleus suggests possibility
that virus could infect non-nucleated cells, ancestral eukaryotes. i
wish propose new hypothesis origin eukaryotic nucleus,
posing symbiotic contact orthopoxvirus ancestor archaebacterium,
whose genome already delta-like polymerase gene.
