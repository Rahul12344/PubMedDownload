in 1983 luc montagnier colleagues claimed discovered novel
retrovirus presently known human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). 1984 hiv was
almost universally accepted cause aids. however, 20 years later, hiv
cannot account phenomena retroviral hypothesis was
proposed, namely, kaposi's sarcoma, decrease t4 lymphocytes thus the
opportunistic infections aids patients assumed direct
results decrease. agents hiv patients belonging to
the aids risk groups exposed cause decrease t4 cells. neither the
main predictions hiv hypothesis fulfilled. hiv seropositivity 
developed countries still remains restricted original high risk groups, no
hiv vaccine exists, successful animal model developed. this
communication, critically analyse evidence 1983 claimed to
prove existence hiv. phenomena montagnier colleagues
considered proof existence hiv detection reverse transcriptase 
activity; presence retrovirus-like particles culture; immunological
reactivity proteins culture supernatant which, sucrose
density gradients, banded density 1.16 g/ml ("purified virus") and
antibodies patient's (bru) serum. reverse transcriptase activity be
found viruses retroviruses normal cells. reverse
transcription brought enzyme reverse transcriptase
but also normal, cellular dna polymerases. retrovirus-like particles are
ubiquitous cultures infected retroviruses, especially conditions
employed montagnier et al. reaction proteins "purified
virus" antibodies patient serum montagnier concluded proteins
were hiv proteins antibodies hiv antibodies. since antibodies
are polyspecific, reaction possible define origin of
even one reactant let alone both. even possible, since montagnier's 
"purified virus" contain particles "morphology typical of
retroviruses", proteins cannot retroviral. conclude that, these
phenomena non-specific retroviruses thus cannot considered proof
for existence unique retrovirus hiv.
