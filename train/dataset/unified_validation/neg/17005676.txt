langerhans cells (lcs) antigen-presenting cells skin play
sentinel roles host immune defense secreting proinflammatory molecules 
activating cells. studied interaction vaccinia virus xs52
cells, murine epidermis-derived dendritic cell line serves surrogate 
model lcs. found vaccinia virus productively infects xs52 cells, yet 
this infection displays atypical response anti-poxvirus agents. whereas
adenosine n1-oxide blocked virus production viral protein synthesis 
synchronous infection, cytosine arabinoside effect concentrations
sufficient prevent virus replication bsc40 monkey kidney cells. vaccinia
virus infection xs52 cells failed elicit production various
cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1beta
(il-1beta), il-6, il-10, il-12 p40, alpha interferon (ifn-alpha), ifn-gamma, 
it actively inhibited production proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and
il-6 xs52 cells response exogenous lipopolysaccharide (lps) or
poly(i:c). infection vaccinia virus mutant lacking e3l gene resulted
in tnf-alpha secretion absence applied stimuli. infection xs52 cells
or bsc40 cells deltae3l virus, wild-type vaccinia virus,
triggered proteolytic decay ikappabalpha. results suggest novel role
for e3l protein antagonist nf-kappab signaling pathway.
deltae3l-infected xs52 cells secreted higher levels tnf-alpha il-6 in
response lps poly(i:c) cells infected wild-type virus.
xs52 cells productively infected vaccinia virus mutant lacking k1l 
gene. deltak1l-infected cells secreted higher levels tnf-alpha il-6 in
response lps wild-type virus-infected cells. vaccinia virus infection

reporter protein expressed infected lcs. vaccinia virus infection of
primary lcs strongly inhibited capacity antigen-specific activation
