the modulation motor behavior protein kinase c (pkc) signaling pathways 
nigrostriatal neurons examined using genetic intervention approach.
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) vectors encode catalytic domain rat
pkcbetaii (pkcdelta) developed. pkcdelta exhibited constitutively active
protein kinase activity substrate specificity similar rat brain
pkc. demonstrated cultured sympathetic neurons, pkcdelta caused a
long-lasting, activation-dependent increase neurotransmitter release. the
rat brain, microinjection hsv-1 vectors contain tyrosine hydroxylase 
promoter targeted expression dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. expression of
pkcdelta small percentage nigrostriatal neurons (approximately 0.1-2%)
was sufficient produce long-term (>/=1 month) change apomorphine-induced 
rotational behavior. nigrostriatal neurons catecholaminergic
neurons contained pkcdelta, amount rotational behavior was
correlated number affected nigrostriatal neurons. change in
apomorphine-induced rotational behavior blocked dopamine receptor
antagonist (fluphenazine). d2-like dopamine receptor density increased in
those regions striatum innervated affected nigrostriatal neurons.
therefore, strategy enabled demonstration pkc pathway pkc
pathways nigrostriatal neurons modulate apomorphine-induced rotational
behavior, altered dopaminergic transmission nigrostriatal neurons
appears affected neuronal physiology responsible change in
rotational behavior.
