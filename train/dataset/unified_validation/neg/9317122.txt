the presentation pathways followed dr1-restricted determinants fusion
protein measles virus studied. assessing capacity various apc
preparations stimulate fusion protein-specific cells, shown 
determinant contained within fusion protein sequence 254-268 (f254) relies on
newly synthesized dr1 protein presentation. contrast, determinant 
contained within fusion protein sequence 314-328 (f314) captured dr1
protein recycled plasma membrane. vitro binding analyses showed 
the f254 f314 peptides optimally bind dr1 ph 4 ph 5, respectively. 
in addition, found binding f254 peptide dr1 much poorer 
at ph 7 ph 4, binding f314 peptide decreased only
moderately ph 7 compared ph 5. substitution glutamic acid 261
for alanine f254 peptide resulted analogue improved
capacity binding dr1 neutral ph. contrast, replacement valine 
319 glutamic acid f314 peptide generated analogue decreased
binding capacity ph 7. findings indicated determinants 
bear acidic residues captured efficiently dr1 molecules broader
range ph determinants containing acidic residues. binding analyses
between dr1 four additional peptides supported conclusion.
altogether, results suggested acidic residues, tuning optimal
ph assembly peptide-dr1 complexes, determine processing pathway
followed determinants.
