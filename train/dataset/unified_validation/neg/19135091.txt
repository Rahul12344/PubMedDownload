west nile virus (wnv) emerging human pathogen specific antiviral 
therapy developed. therapeutic potential rna interference
(rnai) sequence-specific inhibitor wnv well demonstrated.
although multiple sirna targets identified within genomic coding
region, targets within untranslated regions (utr), encode cis-acting
regulatory elements, remain relatively unknown. wnv flaviviruses,
utrs located genomic termini. regions form complex secondary
structures, pose difficulty designing effective sirna targets. this
study, report identification sirna targets wnv 3' utr. these
targets selected sirna predictor algorithms, synthesized short
hairpin rna sequences plasmid-based expression system. vero cells stably
expressing sequences greatly diminished ability support wnv
replication related dengue virus, demonstrating sirnas 
effective suppressed wnv viral replication sequence-specific manner. the
sirnas developed study could function potential antiviral therapeutics
and genetic tools investigate role 3' utr wnv pathogenesis.
