aims: lymphoblastoid cell lines derived marek's disease virus (mdv) induced 
tumours served models mdv latency transformation. stable 
and cultured detectable mdv genomic alterations upon repeated
passaging. mdv transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (t9 cell line) 
reported contain disrupted mdv bamhi-h fragment rous associated virus 
insertional activation c-myb protooncogene. attempt define the
respective participation c-myb mdv transformed phenotype t9
cells, analysis mdv oncogenic sequences (bamhi-h, bamhi-a, ecoq
fragments) performed cells.
methods: using two different passages t9 cell line (late early
passages), organisation mdv oncogenic regions expression 
these cells analysed. vivo assessment oncogenicity virus
contained within cells assessed injecting 1 day old
chickens.
results: t9 cells maintained culture six months (late t9), the
mdv icp4 gene disrupted, whereas meq gene actively transcribed. the
alterations mdv genome cells correlated inability the
virus induce classic signs marek's disease 1 day old chickens.
however, early t9 cells submitted limited number passages induced classic
mdv pathogenicity, efficiently mdv control cell line (t5), 
show gross structural changes oncogenic mdv sequences.
conclusions: although expression pattern mdv oncogenes early t9
cells identical one reported mdv transformed cells, longterm
culture mdv transformed cell line containing rav insertional activation
of c-myb protooncogene led disruption mdv bamhi-h bamhi-a
oncogenic regions. late t9 cells meq detected mdv
oncoprotein. results suggest late t9 cells truncated myb
protein compensates loss mdv oncoproteins reinforce the
possibility meq myb cooperate maintenance transformed
state tumorigenic potential cells.
