viral cross protection plants known acquired immunity phenomenon,
where mild virus isolate/strain protect plants economic damage
caused severe challenge strain/isolate virus. mild strain cross 
protection (mscp) used extensively control losses caused few
major virus diseases parts world. far, none many
proposed mechanisms fully explain intact process mscp. fact, may
be different mechanisms involved mscp different viruses, even
when different research approaches used virus, different
mechanisms could proposed. molecular detail mscp still remains unclear,
although several lines evidence imply resistance protein and/or
rna mediated. data date shown minimum time (a days to
less month) required mild virus strain establish mscp. to
investigate interference among virus strains plant host early stage
of mscp subcellular level, developed rapid micro-extraction method 
the preparation total nucleic acid (tna), combined molecular
methods, monitor interaction virus strains short time intervals in
young plants. method initially developed study mechanism 
of mscp citrus tristeza virus, potentially widespread application
to viruses efficiently used extract 50,000 tna
samples citrus viruses, viroids, bacteria.
