therapeutic strategies controlling human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection are
limited due adverse side effects emergence antiviral resistance
variants. compound evaluated treating hcmv disease maribavir (mbv)
which disrupts replication inhibiting viral kinase pul97. previous studies
have demonstrated antiviral activity mbv sensitive the
proliferation state infected cell. studies, interested in
determining whether inhibition pro-proliferative transcription factor,
signal transducer activator transcription-3 (stat3), could influence the
antiviral activity mbv. addition stat3 inhibitor, s3i-201, during
infection altered hcmv-mediated changes cell cycle protein expression. upon
combining s3i-201 mbv, data suggest stat3 inhibition acting
synergistically mbv inhibit infection vitro. furthermore, specific
concentrations s3i-201 mbv induced caspase-dependent death infected but
not uninfected cell. studies suggest treating infection both
s3i-201 mbv novel approach inhibit hcmv replication.
