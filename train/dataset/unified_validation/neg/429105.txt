distance constraints macromolecular conformation.

crippen gm.

many physico-chemical studies made proteins determine something of
their solution conformation. example coat protein tobacco mosaic virus
has subjected non-crystallographic experimental studies determine
its native conformation perhaps protein. yet sum the
experimentally determined constraints tertiary structure surprisingly 
inadequate fix conformation. able detect remove minor
inconsistencies data calculate sampling conformations
consistent data, differ among r.m.s. deviations 
of respective interresidue distances ranging 5.7 angstrom 15.8
angstrom. individual interresidue distances differ much 50 angstrom
from structure structure. order restrict range possible
conformations something corresponding errors 10 angstrom
resolution x-ray crystal structure, chemical spectroscopic studies 
to much detailed anything done date. calculations appear to
be useful deciding experiments would productive.
