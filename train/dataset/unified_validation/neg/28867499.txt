background: integrase strand transfer inhibitors (instis) coadministered two
nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis) recommended
as first-line treatment hiv, coformulated fixed-dose combinations are
preferred facilitate adherence. report 48-week results study
comparing initial hiv-1 treatment bictegravir-a novel insti high
in-vitro barrier resistance low potential perpetrator victim of
clinically relevant drug interactions-coformulated nrti combination
emtricitabine tenofovir alafenamide fixed-dose combination to
dolutegravir administered coformulated emtricitabine tenofovir
alafenamide.
methods: randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled,
non-inferiority trial, hiv-infected adults screened enrolled 126
outpatient centres 10 countries australia, europe, latin america, north
america. participants previously untreated adults (hiv-1 rna ≥500 copies per
ml) estimated glomerular filtration rate least 30 ml/min. chronic
hepatitis b virus hepatitis c co-infection allowed. randomly assigned
participants (1:1) receive oral fixed-dose combination bictegravir 50 mg,
emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg dolutegravir 50 mg 
coformulated emtricitabine 200 mg tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg, matching 
placebo, day 144 weeks. investigators, participants, study staff, 
those assessing outcomes masked treatment group. participants who
received least one dose study drug included primary efficacy and
safety analyses. primary endpoint proportion participants with
plasma hiv-1 rna less 50 copies per ml week 48 (us food drug
administration snapshot algorithm), prespecified non-inferiority margin of
-12%. study registered clinicaltrials.gov, number nct02607956.
findings: nov 11, 2015, july 15, 2016, 742 participants screened
for eligibility, 657 randomly assigned treatment (327 with
bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide fixed-dose combination
[bictegravir group] 330 dolutegravir plus emtricitabine tenofovir
alafenamide [dolutegravir group]). 320 participants received bictegravir 
regimen 325 participants received dolutegravir regimen included 
in primary efficacy analyses. week 48, hiv-1 rna <50 copies per ml was
achieved 286 (89%) 320 participants bictegravir group 302 (93%) 
of 325 dolutegravir group (difference -3·5%, 95·002% ci -7·9 1·0,
p=0·12), showing non-inferiority bictegravir regimen dolutegravir
regimen. treatment-emergent resistance study drug observed.
incidence severity adverse events similar groups, few
participants discontinued treatment due adverse events (5 [2%] 320 the
bictegravir group 1 [<1%] 325 dolutegravir group). study drug-related 
adverse events less common bictegravir group dolutegravir
group (57 [18%] 320 vs 83 [26%] 325, p=0·022).
interpretation: 48 weeks, virological suppression bictegravir regimen
was achieved non-inferior dolutegravir regimen previously
untreated adults. emergent resistance either regimen. the
fixed-dose combination bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide
was safe well tolerated compared dolutegravir regimen.
