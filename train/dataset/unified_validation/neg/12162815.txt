an e1/e2a/e3-deficient adenoviral vector encoding epitope-tagged (flagged)
human factor viii (fviii) cdna delivered systemically four cynomolgus
monkeys. analysis liver biopsy samples revealed presence vector dna 
all points study (day 7, 28, 56), vector copy number declining
approximately 10-fold day 7 day 56. immunoprecipitation/western
analyses detected human flagged fviii plasma monkeys expression
persisted 14-28 days. peak plasma fviii levels ranged 50 100 ng/ml.
bethesda assays revealed inhibitor two animals, development a
low-level transient inhibitor one animal, inhibitor titer that
continued increase duration study one animal. other
treatment-related changes included modest increases liver enzymes, increase
in interleukin-6 (il-6) levels, transient decrease platelets four
animals. data indicate early generation adenoviral vectors not
support long-term expression fviii nonhuman primates.
