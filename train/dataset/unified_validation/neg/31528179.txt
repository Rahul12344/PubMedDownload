t cells fundamental effector cells viruses cancers be
divided different subsets based long-term immune protection and
immediate immune response effects. percentage absolute number these
subsets change ageing, leads reduced immune response older
individuals. stem cell memory cells (tscm) represent small population of
memory cells enhanced proliferation differentiation properties that
are endowed high potential maintaining cell homeostasis. however,
whether cells change ageing gender remains unknown. here, we
assayed distribution tscm cell subsets peripheral blood
from 92 healthy subjects (44 females 48 males) ranging 3 88 years old
by flow cytometry. found cd4+ cd8+ tscm circulation have
relatively stable frequencies, absolute number cd8+ tscm decreased
with age; however, ratio tscm cd4+ cd8+ naïve population
increased age. unlike obvious changes cell subsets age
and gender, stable level tscm peripheral blood may support their
capacity sustaining long-term immunological memory, importance
may increase together ageing.
