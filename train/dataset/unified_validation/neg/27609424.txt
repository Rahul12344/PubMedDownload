objective: hepatitis c result ribonucleic acid (rna) virus (hepatitis
c virus; hcv). japan society hepatology (jsh) estimated 1.5-2 million
people japan carry hcv. six major hcv genotypes (gt) large number of
subtypes described literature. japan, around 70% 80% of
people infected hcv genotype 1b. progress disease primarily
affects liver may lead liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc)
and death. sofosbuvir (sof) nucleotide analogue ns5b inhibitor and
ledipasvir (ldv) inhibitor hcv ns5a protein. combined 
single tablet regimen treatment gt1 patients resulted sustained
virological response (svr) 94% large phase iii trials. analysis
assesses cost-utility ldv/sof gt1 patients japan.
research design methods: cohort 10,000 patients followed a
markov model reached 100 years age. gt1 treatment-naïve and
experienced, non-cirrhotic cirrhotic patients studied separately.
ldv/sof compared several treatment regimens containing pegylated
interferon (pegifn), telaprevir (tvr), simeprevir (smv), daclatasvir (dcv),
asunaprevir (asv) ribavirin (rbv). discount rates 2% applied costs
and outcomes according japanese guidelines.
results: ldv/sof cost-effective comparators incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (icers) jpy 5,000,000. applying societal
perspective, ldv/sof dominant treatment strategy cases. moreover, 
ldv/sof reduced number cases advanced liver disease. results were
robust sensitivity analyses.
conclusions: ldv/sof cost-effective compared currently
recommended treatments. furthermore, ldv/sof extends treatments hcv-infected
patients ineligible interferon rbv-based regimens. ldv/sof thus
has potential help reduce burden hcv japan.
