to determine whether 48-week course amprenavir-based antiretroviral therapy 
is associated metabolic alterations, 14 clinically stable human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected, protease inhibitor-naive adults initiated 
amprenavir-based triple therapy. twelve subjects (86%) achieved hiv rna levels of
<400 copies/ml week 24. fasting glucose insulin levels change.
insulin sensitivity decrease first 24 weeks, trend toward 
decrease appeared week 48. six subjects experienced onset worsening of
glucose tolerance week 24. levels fasting triglycerides low-density
lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol increased. bone
mineral content, lean tissue, total fat, trunk fat, limb fat, ratio of
trunk limb fat increased week 48. amprenavir-based therapy associated
with increases serum lipid levels short-term decrease insulin
sensitivity. trend toward insulin resistance appeared late study
following weight gain, particularly trunk fat, without loss limb fat.
