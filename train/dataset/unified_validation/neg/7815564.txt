we report identification four additional genes autographa
californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus involved expression late
baculovirus promoter transient expression assays. three genes, p35,
39k, p47, previously described. role p35 gene product in
late gene expression may related ability block apoptosis, since two 
other baculovirus genes also known block apoptosis, cp-iap op-iap, were
able functionally replace p35 transient expression assay. the
requirement p47 assay confirms role late gene expression, a
role previously established characterization temperature-sensitive mutant
of p47, requirement 39k may related known association
with virogenic stroma. fourth gene identified late expression factor
gene, lef-11, located immediately upstream 39k predicted encode 
a 13-kda polypeptide. plasmids containing 4 genes cotransfected
with plasmids containing 14 genes previously identified late gene
expression factors, level expression late capsid promoter was
similar observed library clones representing entire viral
genome. genes provided 18 plasmids thus represent viral genes
necessary sufficient support expression late viral promoter this
transient expression assay.
