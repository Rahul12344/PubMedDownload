in mosquito species conditions experienced larvae development 
have shown lead changes susceptibility various arboviruses in
the adult female. since laboratory mosquitoes generally reared ideal
conditions, mosquito vector competence experiments laboratory may not
accurately reflect vector?virus relationships nature. examined the
consequences larval nutritional stress culex tarsalis vector competence for
west nile virus (wnv). larval nutrition deprivation resulted increased
development time, decreased pupation emergence rates, smaller adult
female body size. however, infection, dissemination, transmission rates for
wnv 5, 7, 14 days postfeeding consistently affected. these
results suggest larval nutritional rearing protocols major factor 
in laboratory estimates wnv vector competence cx. tarsalis.
