the intensified surveillance scrapie small ruminants european union 
(eu) resulted substantial increase number diagnosed cases.
four rapid tests passed eu evaluation bse testing cattle
are also recommended currently used testing small ruminants the
eu authorities. tests include indirect elisa (celisa), colorimetric
sandwich elisa (selisa i), chemiluminescent sandwich elisa (selisa ii), a
western blot (wb). point, majority samples screened by
using either selisa (predominantly germany) wb (predominantly france).
in study, shown number german french scrapie cases
show inconsistent results using rapid confirmatory test methods. forty-eight 
german sheep, 209 french sheep 19 french goat transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (tse) cases tested. cases recognised selisa i
and either one confirmatory methods (scrapie-associated fibrils
(saf)-immunoblot immunohistochemistry). surprisingly, three rapid tests failed
to detect significant number scrapie cases (29 france 24 germany).
the possible reasons inconsistent reaction patterns scrapie cases
are discussed. similar discrepancies observed rapid testing 
of cattle bse, disease diagnostic methods applied been
evaluated.
