whitefly-transmitted, cucurbit-infecting begomoviruses (genus begomovirus, family
geminiviridae) detected cucurbit crops bangladesh, china, egypt, 
israel, malaysia, mexico, philippines, thailand, united states, vietnam. 
pumpkin plants showing leaf curling, blistering, yellowing symptoms were
observed avrdc fields (tainan, taiwan) 2001 nearby farmers' 
fields 2005. two samples symptomatic plants collected 2001
and six collected 2005. viral dnas extracted (2), pcr, with
previously described primers, used detect presence begomoviral
dna-a (4), dna-b (3), associated satellite dna (1). begomoviral dna-a was
detected one 2001 samples 2005 samples. pcr-amplified
1.5 kb viral dna-a one positive sample 2001 2005
collections cloned sequenced. basis 1.5-kb dna-a sequences,
specific primers designed completely sequence dna-a component. the
overlap fragments obtained using primer walking ranged 43 119 bp 
with 100% nt identities. complete dna-a sequences determined two
isolates 2,734 bp (2001) (genbank accession no. dq866135) 2,733 bp (2005) 
(genbank accession no. ef199774). sequence comparisons analyses were
performed using dnaman sequence analysis software (lynnon corporation,
vaudreuil, quebec, canada). dna-a begomovirus isolates contained 
the conserved nanosequence-taatattac six open reading frames, including two
in virus sense four complementary sense. basis 99%
shared nucleotide sequence identity, considered isolates same
species. blastn analysis comparison sequence others available
in genbank database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) indicated taiwan
virus shared highest nt identity (more 95%) squash leaf curl
philippines virus (genbank accession no. ab085793). virus-associated satellite
dna found samples. dna-b found samples,
providing evidence virus bipartite squash
leaf curl philippines virus. knowledge, first report squash
