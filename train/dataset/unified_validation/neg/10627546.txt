to express function encoded genome, herpes simplex virus 1
capsid-tegument structure released deenvelopment entry cells must 
be transported retrograde nuclear pore viral dna released into
the nucleus. path essential case virus entering axons dorsal
root ganglia. objective study identify viral proteins 
may involved transport. report following findings. (i) the
neuronal isoform intermediate chain (ic-1a) dynein complex pulled
down, lysates [(35)s]methionine-labeled infected cells, two viral
proteins identified products u(l)34 u(l)31 open reading frames,
respectively. u(l)34 protein virion protein associated cellular
membranes phosphorylated viral kinase u(s)3. u(l)31 protein a
largely insoluble, evenly dispersed nuclear phosphoprotein required optimal
processing packaging viral dna preformed capsids. reciprocal pulldown
experiments verified interaction ic-1a u(l)34 protein. similar
experiments, u(l)34 protein found interact u(l)31 protein the
major capsid protein icp5. (ii) determine whether u(l)34 protein is
transported nuclear membrane, requirement involved in
transport, u(l)34 protein inserted baculovirus vector the
cytomegalovirus major early promoter. cells infected recombinant
baculovirus expressed u(l)34 protein dose-dependent manner, u(l)34
protein localized primarily nuclear membrane. unexpected finding was
that u(l)34-expressing cells showed dissociation inner outer nuclear
membranes reminiscent morphologic changes seen cells productively
infected herpes simplex virus 1. u(l)34, like many viral proteins, may
have multiple functions expressed early late infection.
