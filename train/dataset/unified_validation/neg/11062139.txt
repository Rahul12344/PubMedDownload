epithelial intercellular adhesion fundamental formation airway
epithelial protective barrier. respect, cadherins important because
these adhesion molecules regulate formation maintenance epithelial
intercellular junctions. study importance airway epithelial integrity
in determining susceptibility virus infection, used a
replication-incompetent adenovirus, rad35, e-cadherin specific
function-blocking antibody, she78-7, disrupt intercellular contacts human
bronchial epithelial cell line 16hbe14o- primary bronchial epithelial cells. 
after exposure 16hbe14o- cell cultures she78-7, disruption the
transepithelial permeability barrier indicated loss transepithelial
electrical resistance associated increase mannitol, inulin, dextran
paracellular flux. subsequent exposure she78-7-treated cell cultures rad35 
showed remarkable increase adenoviral infection assessed by
beta-galactosidase reporter gene expression. cultures exposed she78-7,
disruption e-cadherin function resulted infection equivalent in
control cultures using 16-fold lower viral titers. studies show that
manipulation e-cadherin function provides specific means altering
epithelial integrity turn determines resistance airway epithelia to
adenoviral infection.
