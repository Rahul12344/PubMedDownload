cd4+ cells die individuals infected hiv, either result direct
hiv infection uninfected "innocent bystanders". possible mechanisms for
bystander killing include generation viral products tat gp120 and
expression death receptor ligands, fasl, engage functional death 
receptors uninfected cells. review covers sometimes conflicting in
vitro ex vivo studies address possible mechanisms of
hiv-associated cell death. intriguing possibility manipulation of
cell death processes, decrease bystander death increase death infected
cells, patients infected hiv might provide useful adjunct to
antiretroviral therapy.
