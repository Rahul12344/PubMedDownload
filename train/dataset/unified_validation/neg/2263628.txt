we identified region human tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) 
gene promoter necessary maximal constitutive, virus-induced, and
lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced transcription. region contains three sites 
that match nf-kappa b binding-site consensus sequence. show these
three sites specifically bind nf-kappa b vitro, yet sites be
deleted tnf-alpha promoter little effect induction the
gene virus lps. moreover, multimers three sites placed
upstream truncated tnf-alpha promoter, heterologous promoter, an
increase basal level transcription observed influenced by
sequence context cell type. however, multimers sufficient for
virus lps induction either promoter. thus, unlike virus- and
lps-inducible promoters contain nf-kappa b binding sites, sites from
the tnf-alpha promoter neither required sufficient virus lps
induction. comparison sequence requirements virus induction the
human tnf-alpha gene mouse l929 p388d1 cells reveals significant
differences, indicating sequence requirements virus induction the
gene cell type-specific. however, sequences required virus lps
induction gene single cell type, p388d1, overlap.
