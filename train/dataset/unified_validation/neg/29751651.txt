clostridium perfringens one common causes food-borne illness.
the increasing prevalence multidrug-resistant bacteria requires the
development alternatives typical antimicrobial treatments. here, we
isolated characterized c. perfringens-specific virulent bacteriophage cps2 
from chicken feces. cps2 phage contains 17,961 bp double-stranded dna
genome 25 putative orfs, belongs picovirinae, subfamily of
podoviridae. bioinformatic analysis cps2 genome revealed putative
endolysin, lyscps2, homologous endolysin clostridium phage
phizp2 phicp7r. enzyme showed strong lytic activity c.
perfringens optimum conditions ph 7.5⁻10, 25⁻65 °c, broad
range nacl concentrations. interestingly, lyscps2 found highly
thermostable, 30% lytic activity remaining 10 min of
incubation 95 °c. cell wall binding domain c-terminal region of
lyscps2 showed binding spectrum specific c. perfringens strains. the
first report characterize highly thermostable endolysin isolated virulent
c. perfringens bacteriophage. enzyme used alternative biocontrol
and detection agent c. perfringens.
