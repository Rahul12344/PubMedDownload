transgenic tobacco plants carrying number regulatory sequences derived 
the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter tested response to
treatment salicylic acid (sa), endogenous signal involved plant
defense responses. beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene fusions full-length
(-343 +8) 35s promoter -90 truncation found induced sa.
time course experiments revealed that, continuous presence sa, -90 
promoter construct (-90 35s-gus) displayed rapid transient induction
kinetics, maximum rna levels 1 4 hr, declined low levels by
24 hr. induction still apparent presence protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide (chx). moreover, mrna levels continued accumulate over
24 hr rather decline. contrast, mrna endogenous
pathogenesis-related protein-1a (pr-1a) gene began accumulate later times
during sa treatment steadily increased 24 hr; transcription this
gene almost completely blocked presence chx. dissection 
the region -90 -46 35s promoter revealed sa-responsive
element corresponds previously characterized activation sequence-1 (as-1).
these results represent definitive analysis immediate early responses sa,
relative late induction pr genes, potentially elucidate early
events sa signal transduction plant defense response.
