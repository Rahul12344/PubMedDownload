kindlins essential coactivators, talin, cell surface
receptors integrins also participate integrin outside-in signalling, and
the control gene transcription cell nucleus. kindlins ~75 kda
multidomain proteins bind npxy motif upstream t/s cluster the
integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tail. hematopoietically-important kindlin
isoform, kindlin-3, critical platelet aggregation thrombus
formation, leukocyte rolling response infection inflammation and
osteoclast podocyte formation bone resorption. kindlin-3's role these
processes resulted extensive cellular physiological studies. however, 
there need efficient method acquiring high quality milligram
quantities protein studies. developed protocol, here
described, efficient expression purification recombinant murine
kindlin-3 use baculovirus-driven expression system sf9 cells yielding 
sufficient amounts high purity full-length protein allow biophysical
characterization. approach could taken study other
mammalian kindlin isoforms.
