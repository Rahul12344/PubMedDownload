richter's transformation denotes development high-grade non-hodgkin
lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia, hodgkin disease, acute leukemia patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll)/small lymphocytic lymphoma. search of
published articles medline (pubmed) abstracts professional meetings
was performed. electronic database search patients cll the
university texas m. d. anderson cancer center (houston, tx) determined the
incidence richter syndrome (rs) patients cll 1992 2002. rs
occurs approximately 5% patients cll. large cells rs may arise 
through transformation original cll clone represent new neoplasm. rs 
may triggered viral infections, epstein-barr virus. trisomy 12 
chromosome 11 abnormalities frequent patients rs the
overall population patients cll. multiple genetic defects, as
mutations p53 tumor suppressor gene, p16ink4a, p21, loss p27
expression, deletion retinoblastoma, increased copy number c-myc, and
decreased expression a-myb gene, described. abnormalities 
may cause cll cells proliferate and-by facilitating acquisition new
genetic abnormalities-to transform rs cells. therapeutic strategies include 
intensive chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, stem cell transplantation. the
response rates range 5% 43% (complete response, 5-38%), median
survival duration ranges 5 months 8 months. conclusion, rs may be
triggered viral infections genetic defects. current treatments are
aggressive, prognosis poor. novel curative treatment strategies are
needed.
