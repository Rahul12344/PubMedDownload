acute encephalitis observed suckling golden syrian hamsters following
intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation hamster brain adapted strain subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) measles virus (hbs). virus isolated from
the brains encephalitic animals cocultivation tissue vero
cells. histopathology encephalitis characterized perivascular
mononuclear infiltrates, necrosis, eosinophilic inclusion bodies, rare giant 
cells. association encephalitis systemic viral infection observed
with virus present lung kidney-spleen pool addition brain. viral
dissemination asymptomatic animals documented virus isolated
from multiple non-neural tissues (spleen, lung, liver) animals no
recoverable virus brains signs encephalitis. treatment of
animals cyclophosphamide prior ip virus inoculation increase
dissemination brain. absence encephalitis asymptomatic animals with
proven viral dissemination parenchymal organs indicates neither viremia
alone, viremia conjunction dissemination sufficient conditions to
establish central nervous system disease. association encephalitis with
systemic viral infection dissemination brain establish model's
potential value study pathogenesis measles encephalitis.
