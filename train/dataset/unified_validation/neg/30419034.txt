background: enteric infections common public health infrastructure is
lacking. study assesses risk factors range enteric infections among
children living low-income, unplanned communities urban maputo, mozambique.
methods & findings: conducted cross-sectional survey 17 neighborhoods 
maputo assess prevalence reported diarrheal illness and
laboratory-confirmed enteric infections children. collected stool from
children aged 1-48 months, independent reported symptoms, molecular
detection 15 common enteric pathogens multiplex rt-pcr. also collected
survey observational data related water, sanitation, hygiene (wash)
characteristics; environmental factors; social, economic, and
demographic covariates. analyzed stool 759 children living 425
household clusters (compounds) representing range environmental conditions. 
we detected ≥1 enteric pathogens stool children (86%, 95% confidence
interval (ci): 84-89%) though diarrheal symptoms reported 16% (95% 
ci: 13-19%) children enteric infections 13% (95% ci: 11-15%) all
children. prevalence enteric infection positively associated age 
and ranged 71% (95% ci: 64-77%) children 1-11 months 96% (95% ci:
93-98%) children 24-48 months. found poor sanitary conditions, as
presence feces soiled diapers around compound, associated with
higher risk protozoan infections. certain latrine features, including
drop-hole covers latrine walls, presence water tap compound
grounds associated lower risk bacterial protozoan infections. 
any breastfeeding also associated reduced risk infection.
conclusions: found high prevalence enteric infections, primarily among
children without diarrhea, weak associations bacterial protozoan 
infections environmental risk factors including wash. findings suggest that
environmental health interventions limit infections would need be
transformative given high prevalence enteric pathogen shedding poor
sanitary conditions observed.
