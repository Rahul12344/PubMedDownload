gene mutations implicated etiology cancer, developmental
anomalies, genetic disease aging. many different methods mutation
detection developed applied obtain fundamental insight in
the chain molecular events ultimately lead mutations. these
methods, however, applied cultured cells therefore not
allow comparative analysis mutations various organs tissues an
intact organism. main difficulty studying mutagenesis chromosomal dna
is identify isolate mutated genes high efficiency. describe
the development application lacz transgenic mouse models studying, 
different organs tissues, spontaneous induced mutations. models allow
study induction dna damage, repair, mutagenesis carcinogenesis in
one animal system. accordingly, results obtained may ultimately provide greater
insight chain events vivo exposure genotoxic agents to
mutations ultimate physiological endpoints. addition use in
fundamental research, transgenic animal mutation models find major application 
in field genetic toxicology testing, particular respect organ
specificity.
