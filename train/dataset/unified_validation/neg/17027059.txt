varicella-zoster virus (vzv) encodes two multiply inserted membrane proteins,
open reading frame (orf) 39 protein (orf39p) glycoprotein k (gk). hsv-1
homologs proteins believed act conjunction other
during viral egress cell-cell fusion, directly influence each
other's intracellular trafficking. however, orf39p vzv gk received 
limited study largely due difficulties producing antibodies highly
hydrophobic proteins. overcome obstacle, introduced epitope tags 
both orf39p gk examined intracellular distributions transfected 
and infected cells. data demonstrate orf39p gk accumulate
predominately er cultured cells expressed absence 
vzv proteins coexpressed isolation vzv proteins. therefore,
the transport vzv orf39p gk exhibit functional
interdependence seen hsv-1 homologs. however, infection, the
primary distributions orf39p gk shift er golgi, they
are also found plasma membrane indicating intracellular
trafficking infection depends vzv-encoded proteins. during
infection, orf39p gk tightly colocalize vzv envelope glycoproteins b, e 
and h; however, coexpression orf39p gk individual viral
glycoproteins insufficient alter transport either orf39p gk.
