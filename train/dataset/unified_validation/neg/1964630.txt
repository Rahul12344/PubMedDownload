the author concentrated contamined foodstuffs poliovirus type 1--vaccine
strain--by means negative pressure overpressure filtration across membranes
with different porosity means ultracentrifuge. foods - milk, meat,
meat products vegetables contaminated virus various doses
corresponded approximately 1.2 4 pfu per gram specimen. virus in
concentrates detected cell cultures vero line plaque method.
the virus extract (number pfu expressed per cent) originally
inoculated absorbed amount virus resp. follows: negative
filtration average 53%, overpressure filtration without use of
polyelectrolyte average 75%, using polyelectrolyte 79% using
utracentrifugation average 87%.
