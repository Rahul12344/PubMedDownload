objectives: aim study compare amprenavir pharmacokinetics in
hiv/hepatitis c virus (hcv)-co-infected cirrhotic patients receiving non-boosted 
fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily hcv/hiv-co-infected non-cirrhotic subjects 
and hiv-mono-infected subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg twice
daily. liver stiffness baseline alanine aminotransferase levels at
baseline follow-up measured order find correlation
between drug levels liver fibrosis hepatotoxicity.
methods: amprenavir plasma concentration determined hplc. liver stiffness 
was measured transient elastometry. liver function tests determined every
1-3 months follow-up.
results: nineteen hiv-infected patients included. eight chronic hcv
hepatitis (group nc), five hcv-related liver cirrhosis (group c) six were
hiv-mono-infected (group m). group c patients, amprenavir c(trough), auc(0-12)
and half-life 86%/83%, 64%/55% 58%/59% lower compared controls
and co-infected subjects without cirrhosis, respectively; conversely, drug
clearance cirrhotics 181%/124% higher. 3/5 cirrhotic patients (60%) and
in 2/14 non-cirrhotic patients (14%), c(trough) minimum target
concentration 400 ng/ml; nonetheless, patients, hiv viral load
was undetectable. correlation found amprenavir pharmacokinetics
and liver stiffness hepatotoxicity follow-up.
conclusions: basis data, seems reasonable boost
fosamprenavir ritonavir even cirrhotic patients; amprenavir
pharmacokinetics could predicted liver stiffness seem to
predict hepatotoxicity follow-up.
