two hundred seventeen field isolates cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (cmv),
sampled 11 natural populations, typed rnase protection assay (rpa)
using probes genomic rnas strains subgroup subgroup ii of
cmv strains. (85%) analyzed isolates belonged subgroup i. for
these subgroup isolates, two clearly different rpa patterns, b, were
found four probes representing rna1, rna2, two open
reading frames rna3. basis rpa patterns probe,
different haplotypes defined. frequency composition haplotypes
differed various analyzed populations, correlation place 
year sampling. genetic structure corresponds metapopulation with
local extinctions recolonizations. subgroup isolates (73%) belonged to
haplotypes rpa pattern (type 1) b (type 2) four probes. a
significant fraction subgroup isolates (16%) gave evidence mixed
infections two main types, genetic exchange could occur.
genetic exchange segment reassortment seen occur: fraction of
reassortant isolates 4%, reassortment occur random, and
reassortants become established population. thus, is
evidence selection reassortment types 1 2 subgroup i
isolates. aphid transmission experiments plants doubly infected type 1 
and type 2 isolates gave evidence reassortment selected against
in cmv. genetic exchange recombination detected rna3, two
rpa probes used. recombinant isolates amounted 7% also become
established cmv populations. sequence analyses regions rna1, rna2, and
rna3 showed strong constraints maintain encoded sequence
and also gave evidence constraints may different during
divergence types 1 2 and, later on, diversification two
types. constraints evolution encoded proteins may related to
selection genetic exchange. data, thus, favor current
hypotheses explain evolution multipartite viral genomes promote
genetic exchange.
