the novel capsid-binding antiviral pleconaril inhibits vitro replication of
most rhinoviruses enteroviruses. oral pleconaril treatment studied 2
parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. among 1363
picornavirus-infected participants (65%) studies combined, median time
to alleviation illness 1 day shorter pleconaril recipients for
placebo recipients (p<.001). cold symptom scores frequency picornavirus
cultured nasal mucus specimens lower among pleconaril recipients day
2 treatment. treatment effects seen without picornavirus
infection. pleconaril associated higher incidence nausea (6% vs.
4%) diarrhea (9% vs. 7%) small increases mean serum cholesterol
levels platelet counts, compared baseline measurements. subsequent
6-week prophylaxis study found pleconaril induces cytochrome p-450 3a
enzymes, metabolize variety drugs, including ethinyl estradiol. early 
pleconaril treatment well tolerated significantly reduced duration
and severity colds due picornaviruses adults.
