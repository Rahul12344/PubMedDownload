surface disinfectants part broader preventive strategies preventing the
transmission bacteria, fungi viruses medical institutions. evaluate 
their virucidal efficacy, products must tested appropriate model
viruses different physico-chemical properties conditions representing 
practical application hospitals. aim study evaluate a
quantitative carrier assay. furthermore, different putative model viruses like
adenovirus type 5 (adv-5) different animal parvoviruses evaluated with
respect tenacity practicability laboratory handling. evaluate 
the robustness method, viruses tested parallel in
different laboratories multi-center study. different biocides, are
common active ingredients surface disinfectants, used test. 
drying stainless steel discs carrier, model viruses exposed to
different concentrations three alcohols, peracetic acid (paa) or
glutaraldehyde (gda), fixed exposure time 5 minutes. residual virus was
determined treatment endpoint titration. parvoviruses exhibited a
similar stability respect gda, adv-5 susceptible. paa,
the porcine parvovirus sensitive parvoviruses, again,
adv-5 presented higher susceptibility parvoviruses. parvoviruses
were resistant alcohols, adv-5 stable treated with
2-propanol. analysis results multi-center study showed high
reproducibility test system. conclusion, two viruses different
physico-chemical properties recommended appropriate model viruses for
the evaluation virucidal efficacy surface disinfectants: adv-5, which
has high clinical impact, murine parvovirus (mvm) highest
practicability among parvoviruses tested.
