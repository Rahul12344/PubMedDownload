as candidate rapid detection biomaterials, terahertz (thz)
spectroscopy system considered advantage non-destructive,
label-free, non-contact manner. protein-ligand binding energy in
the thz range, especially, important conformational information molecular
interactions captured thz electromagnetic wave. based thz
time-domain spectroscopy system, thz nano-metamaterial sensing chips were
prepared great enhancing detection sensitivity. metamaterial sensing
chip designed increasing absorption cross section target
sample, related transmitted thz near field enhancement via composition
of metamaterial. measured thz optical properties analyzed terms 
of refractive index absorption coefficient, compared simulation
results. also, virus quantification regarding various concentrations the
viruses performed, showing clear linearity. proposed sensitive and
selective thz detection method provide abundant information detected
biomaterials help deep understanding fundamental optical characteristics of
them, suggesting rapid diagnosis way especially useful dangerous and
time-sensitive target biomaterials.
