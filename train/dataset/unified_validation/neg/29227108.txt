cellular secretion proteins extracellular environment essential
mediator critical biological mechanisms, including cell-to-cell communication,
immunological response, targeted delivery, differentiation. here, report a
novel methodology allows real-time detection imaging single
unlabeled proteins secreted individual living cells. is
accomplished via interferometric detection scattered light (iscat) is
demonstrated laz388 cells, epstein-barr virus (ebv)-transformed b cell
line. find single laz388 cells actively secrete igg antibodies rate 
of order 100 molecules per second. intriguingly, also find other
proteins particles spanning ca. 100 kda-1 mda secreted laz388
cells tandem igg antibody release, likely arising ebv-related viral 
proteins. technique general and, show, also applied to
studying lysate single cell. results establish label-free iscat
imaging powerful tool studying real-time exchange cells 
their immediate environment single-protein sensitivity.
