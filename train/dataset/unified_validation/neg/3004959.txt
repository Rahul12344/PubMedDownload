the p53 oncogene thought play role proliferation normal and
transformed cells expression postulated cell cycle dependent.
using flow cytofluorimetry sorting populations exponentially growing cells,
coupled radioimmune assay, investigated accumulation p53
along cell cycle normal fr 3t3 rat cells well two types of
sv40-transformed derivatives, one expresses large-t protein
during g2 phase cell cycle. p53 accumulated constant level
throughout cell cycle fr 3t3 cells. level stability increased to
different extents two types transformants. however, formation of
complexes p53 large-t modulated g2-restricted accumulation
of large-t, thus leading differential increase levels p53 
exponentially growing cells along cell cycle. increase levels
of p53 appeared regulated post-transcriptional level.
