epstein-barr virus (ebv) associated tumours lymphoid and
epithelial origin. whilst role ebv latent genes development these
malignancies accepted, also possible viral proteins involved ebv
replication may influence oncogenic process. bhrf1 immediate early
protein homology bcl-2 oncogene protect b cells from
apoptosis. vivo protein abundantly expressed upper layers 
of oral 'hairy' leukoplakia (hl), benign hyperparakeratotic tongue lesion which
represents focus ebv replication. transfected bhrf1 human
squamous cell carcinoma line scc12f retains several features normal
keratinocytes behaviour vitro. bhrf1 expression epithelial cells is

is apoptotic process, data strongly suggests bhrf1 expression delays
the terminal differentiation epithelial cells prevention of
apoptosis. effect bhrf1, may normally function promote
productive ebv infection, could contribute development ebv-associated
tumours.
