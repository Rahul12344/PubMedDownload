hemodialysis shows high risk hepatitis b infection, hepatitis b virus
(hbv) vaccination become routine procedure. unfortunately, 40% 50%
of hemodialysis patients adequate protective antibodies the
hbv vaccination thought due depressed cell mediated immunity.
levamisole reported stimulate depressed t-cell activity enhance b
lymphocyte function restore delayed hypersensitivity reactions in
immune-depressed patients. studied effects levamisole, an
immunomodulatory agent, protective antibody response hemodialysis
patients hbv vaccination. hemodialysis patients negative anti-hbs
antibody routinely received 40 microg doses recombinant hbv vaccine
intramuscularly 0, 1, 6 months, followed serum anti-hbs levels.
patients serum antibody level >10 miu/ml considered responders.
study groups classified follows. group 1 comprised 96 chronic
hemodialysis patients negative anti-hbs hbv core antibody (52 male, 44
female, mean age 45 +/- 15 years mean hemodialysis duration 46 +/- 40
months) received hbv vaccination; 55 patients (57%) found be
responders. group 2 comprised 19 randomly selected patients never 
received hepatitis b vaccine (13 male, 6 female, mean age 42 +/- 14 years,
mean duration hemodialysis 31 +/- 27 months) started hbv
vaccination protocol levamisole per os 80 mg hemodialysis session
for 4 months followed serum anti-hbs levels. seventeen patients 
completed levamisole treatment. fourteen 17 patients levels
of protective serum antibody indicating higher response rate compared 
with patients receive levamisole (82% versus 57%, respectively, p <
0.05). group 3 comprised 19 patients randomly selected persons who
did respond previous vaccination programs (10 male, 9 female, mean age 
51 +/- 14 years, mean duration hemodialysis 41 +/- 31 months). second hbv
vaccination program started levamisole protocol. group,
18 patients completed treatment model. fourteen responded the
vaccination model. group 4, second hbv vaccination program applied
without levamisole 20 randomly selected persons respond the
previous routine vaccination program (12 male, 8 female, mean age 53 +/- 17
years, mean duration dialysis 51 +/- 38 months). 3 responded a
second vaccination program. comparing group 3 group 4, higher
responder rate hbv vaccination (77% versus 15%, respectively, p < 0.0001).
these results show levamisole treatment increases response rate the
first hbv vaccination previously unresponsive cases modulating
possible cellular immune response.
