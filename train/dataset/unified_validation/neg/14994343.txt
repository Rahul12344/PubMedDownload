neurotrophins (nts) play important role modulation synaptic
transmission morphological changes synaptic structures. although 
is agreement brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) sorted large
dense-core vesicles (ldcvs) released via regulated secretory pathway,
there dispute regarding mode secretion nerve growth
factor (ngf) neurotrophin-3 (nt-3), two structurally related members the
nt family. study, examined subcellular localization release
characteristics ngf, bdnf, nt-3 adenovirus-infected primary cortical
neurons. found members nt family colocalized markers 
the endoplasmic reticulum golgi within cell bodies punctate manner
with marker ldcvs within processes. moreover, release triggered
by depolarization, indicating ngf, bdnf, nt-3 released via the
regulated secretory pathway. neurons coinfected two separate
adenoviruses coding ngf bdnf, nts showed almost complete vesicular
colocalization within single cells, suggesting different nts might be
packaged shared vesicles. also examined whether two splice variants
of ngf, short long precursors, differ release characteristics.
we found neurons infected viruses coding either splice variant
released ngf regulated way. overall, study supports notion 
members nt family undergo activity-dependent regulated release from
neurons, enabling act "synaptotrophins" electrically active
neurons.
