it demonstrated half-life c-myc mrna modulated in
response physiological agents. elucidation decay process the
identification critical steps vivo c-myc mrna degradation
pathway approached following fate c-myc mrna influence
of factors. ifn-alpha factor used modulate c-myc mrna half-life
in hela 1c5 cells, stable clone derived hela cells. cell line carries
multiple copies c-myc gene, control dexamethasone
inducible mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (mmtv-ltr). exposure 
hela 1c5 cells ifn-alpha resulted 2-fold increase the
dexamethasone-induced c-myc mrna. however, c-myc mrna ifn-alpha treated
cells less stable control cells. rnase h mapping 3'
untranslated region c-myc mrna revealed, addition full length mrna, 
three smaller fragments. fragments proven truncated,
non-adenylated c-myc mrna species generated vivo. exposure hela 1c5 cells
to interferon-alpha induction dexamethasone resulted enhanced 
presence intermediates. rnase h analysis c-myc mrna actinomycin
d chase revealed deadenylation led formation relatively more
stable oligoadenylated c-myc mrna population appear precursor
to truncated intermediates. detection truncated 3' end c-myc mrna
adenylated fragments well, implies c-myc mrna degradation process may
follow alternative pathway possibly involving endonucleolytic cleavage.
