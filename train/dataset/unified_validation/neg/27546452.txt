newcastle disease (nd), highly contagious, acute, potent infectious disease
caused newcastle disease virus (ndv), considerable impact global 
poultry industry. although live attenuated inactivated vaccines used
to prevent control spread nd among chickens, increasing number 
nd outbreaks commercial poultry flocks worldwide indicates routine
vaccinations insufficient control nd. hence, efforts invested
into developing alternative effective vaccination strategies. this
study, focus f protein, neutralizing protective antigen ndv, and
flagellin (flic), toll-like receptor 5 (tlr5) agonist effective
inducer innate immune responses. amplified f gene velogenic ndv strain
f48e8. recombinant histidine (his)-tagged f protein efficiently expressed
in pichia pastoris (p. pastoris) eukaryotic system verified sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis western blotting. the
conditions f protein expression p. pastoris optimal. the
immunogenicity f protein flic adjuvant evaluated c3h/hej 
mouse model. flic found enhance f-specific ndv-specific igg
responses f-specific cellular immune responses following intraperitoneal
co-administration f protein. thus, recombinant f protein expressed by
p. pastoris used flagellin adjuvant potential subunit
vaccine candidate.
