micrornas (mirnas) small noncoding rnas. 2500 mature mirnas are
detected plants, animals several types viruses. hepatitis c virus
(hcv), positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus, encode
viral mirna. however, hcv infection alters expression host mirnas, either 
in cell culture patients liver disease progression, liver
fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. turn, host mirnas regulate 
hcv life cycle directly binding hcv rnas indirectly targeting
cellular mrnas. increasing evidence demonstrates mirnas one the
centered factors interaction network virus host. the
competitive viral host rna hypothesis proposes latent cross-regulation
pattern host mrnas hcv rnas. high loads hcv rna sequester and
de-repress host mirnas normal host targets thus disturb host gene 
expression, indicating means adaptation hcv establish persistent
infection. special mirnas closely correlated liver-specific disease
progression changed levels mirnas even higher sensitivity and
specificity traditional proteins. therefore, serve
as novel diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers hcv-infected patients liver
diseases. also attractive therapeutic targets development new
anti-hcv agents.
