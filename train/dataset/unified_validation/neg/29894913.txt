cartilage-derived matrix (cdm) emerged promising scaffold material for
tissue engineering cartilage bone due native chondroinductive
capacity ability support endochondral ossification. it
consists native tissue, cdm undergo cellular remodeling, promote
integration host tissue enables degraded replaced by
neotissue time. however, enzymatic degradation decellularized tissues can
occur unpredictably may allow sufficient time mechanically competent 
tissue form, especially harsh inflammatory environment diseased
joint. goal current study engineer cartilage bone
constructs ability inhibit aberrant inflammatory processes caused 
the cytokine interleukin-1 (il-1), scaffold-mediated delivery of
lentiviral particles containing doxycycline-inducible il-1 receptor antagonist 
(il-1ra) transgene anatomically-shaped cdm constructs. additionally,
scaffold-mediated lentiviral gene delivery used facilitate spatial
organization simultaneous chondrogenic osteogenic differentiation via
site-specific transduction single mesenchymal stem cell (msc) population 
overexpress either chondrogenic, transforming growth factor-beta 3 (tgf-β3), or
osteogenic, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (bmp-2), transgenes. controlled
induction il-1ra expression protected cdm hemispheres from
inflammation-mediated degradation, supported robust bone cartilage tissue
formation even presence il-1. absence inflammatory stimuli,
controlled cellular remodeling exploited mechanism fusing concentric
cdm hemispheres overexpressing bmp-2 tgf-β3 single bi-layered
osteochondral construct. findings demonstrate site-specific delivery 
inducible tunable transgenes confers spatial temporal control both
cdm scaffold remodeling neotissue composition. furthermore, constructs 
provide microphysiological in vitro joint organoid model site-specific,
tunable, inducible protein delivery systems examining spatiotemporal 
response pro-anabolic and/or inflammatory signaling across osteochondral
interface.
