a fragment chicken dna containing left long terminal repeat endogenous 
retrovirus ev-2 flanking cellular sequences molecularly cloned and
analyzed. comparison sequence data analogous regions ev-1 and
rous-associated virus-0 viral dna reveals similarities among flanking regions 
the integrated proviruses among three long terminal repeats. the
latter finding, conclude difference level expression ev-2
and progeny rous-associated virus-0 provirus cannot due sequence
differences upstream long terminal repeats.
