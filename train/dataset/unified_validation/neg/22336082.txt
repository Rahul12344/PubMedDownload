background: respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) rhinovirus infections the
most common significant infant respiratory tract illnesses associated
with increased differential risks childhood asthma.
objective: sought determine whether maternal asthma associated with
higher odds infant respiratory tract infection rhinovirus versus rsv 
increased infection severity.
methods: mother-infant dyads enrolled 2004-2008 infant
respiratory tract infection (104 rhinovirus 279 rsv). mothers 
classified mutually exclusive groups (atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and
no asthma). determined viral cause using pcr severity infant's 
respiratory tract infection using bronchiolitis severity score. adjusted
relative odds maternal asthma viral cause calculated using
logistic regression. proportional odds models assessed association of
maternal asthma infant infection severity.
results: infants mother atopic asthma compared infants whose
mothers asthma likely rhinovirus versus rsv
infection (adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 95% ci, 1.19-4.90). similarly, among
infants rhinovirus, mother atopic asthma associated with
increased infection severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.10; 95% ci, 1.21-7.98). this
relationship seen among infants rsv.
conclusions: clinically significant rhinovirus infection infancy 
strongly associated mother atopic asthma clinically
significant rsv infection. mother atopic asthma associated with
increased severity infant rhinovirus rsv infections. infants with
rhinovirus likely familial atopic predisposition, might
partly explain subsequent increased asthma risk.
