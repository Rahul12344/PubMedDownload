lipopolysaccharide, particularly o-antigen component, one many
virulence determinants necessary shigella flexneri pathogenesis. o-antigen
modification mediated glucosyltransferase genes (gtr) encoded temperate 
serotype-converting bacteriophages. gtrv gene encodes gtrv
glucosyltransferase, integral membrane protein catalyzes transfer 
a glucosyl residue via alpha1,3 linkage rhamnose ii o-antigen unit. 
this mediates conversion s. flexneri serotype serotype 5a. analysis of
the gtrv amino acid sequence using computer prediction programs indicated that
gtrv 9-11 transmembrane segments. computer prediction models tested 
by genetically fusing c-terminal deletions gtrv dual reporter system
composed alkaline phosphatase beta-galactosidase. sandwiched
gtrv-phoa/lacz fusions also constructed predetermined positions. the
enzyme activities cells gtrv-phoa/lacz fusions particular
location fusions gtrv indicated gtrv nine transmembrane
segments one large n-terminal periplasmic loop n c termini
located cytoplasmic periplasmic sides membrane, respectively.
the existence unique reentrant loop discovered transmembrane
segment iv, feature documented bacterial glycosyltransferases. its
potential role mediating serotype conversion s. flexneri discussed.
