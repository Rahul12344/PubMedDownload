retroviral integrases reported form alternate dimer assemblies like the
core-core dimer reaching dimer. core-core dimer stabilized
predominantly extensive interface two catalytic core domains. the
reaching dimer stabilized n-terminal domains reach form
intermolecular interfaces subunit's core c-terminal domains
(ctd), well ctd-ctd interactions. study, molecular dynamics (md),
brownian dynamics (bd) simulations, free energy analyses, performed to
elucidate determinants stability reaching dimer forms of
full-length avian sarcoma virus (asv) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) in, 
and examine role c-tails (the last ~16-18 residues the
c-termini) structural dynamics. dynamics hiv reaching dimer
derived small angle x-ray scattering protein crosslinking data, was
compared dynamics core-core dimer model derived combining 
crystal structures two-domain fragments. results showed core
domains asv reaching dimer express free dynamics, whereas hiv
reaching dimer highly stable. bd simulations suggest higher rate of
association hiv core-core dimer reaching dimer. predicted
stability dimers therefore ranked following order: asv
reaching dimer < hiv reaching dimer < composite core-core dimer. analyses md
trajectories suggested residues critical intermolecular
contacts reaching dimer. tests predictions insights gained
from analyses could reveal potential pathway association and
dissociation full-length multimers.
