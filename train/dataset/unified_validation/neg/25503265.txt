background: pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) daily oral emtricitabine
(ftc)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may select drug resistance is
low adherence.
methods: plasma viral hiv-1 rna level, cd4+ t-cell counts, drug resistance
were evaluated among seroconverting women fem-prep trial
(clinicaltrials.gov nct00625404) using standard clinical tests, allele-specific
pcr (aspcr), deep sequencing. tenofovir, ftc, intracellular
metabolites measured plasma cells.
results: difference plasma hiv-1 rna level cd4+ cell count
among seroconverters active arm versus receiving placebo. tenofovir 
resistance observed. ftc resistance detected using clinical assays in
five seroconverters (four active arm one placebo arm); two in
the active arm occurred among women moderate concentrations prep drugs 
in blood. first evidence infection occurred first
postenrollment visit three four ftc resistance, although none 
detectable viral nucleic acids enrollment. ftc-resistant minor variants were
detected additional four seroconverters (one active arm three in
the placebo arm).
conclusions: drug resistance detected ineffective prep use had
characteristics suggesting transmitted infection incubating infection prior to
starting prep.
