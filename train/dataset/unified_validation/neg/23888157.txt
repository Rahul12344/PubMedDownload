rice gall dwarf virus (rgdv), member family reoviridae, causes repeated 
epidemics rice fields southern china. rgdv isolate collected from
guangdong province (southern china) mainly transmitted leafhopper vector
recilia dorsalis persistent-propagative manner. infection rgdv
induces formation virus-containing tubules plant host insect
vector. study, established continuous cell cultures leafhopper 
r. dorsalis investigate functional role tubules within insect
vector. cytopathologic studies revealed tubules, comprised viral
non-structural protein pns11 contained viral particles, able protrude
from surface cultured leafhopper cells. tubule-like structures formed in
non-host insect cells expression pns11 baculovirus system,
suggesting pns11 minimal viral factor required formation 
the tubules induced rgdv infection. cultured leafhopper cells, knockdown of
pns11 expression rna interference, induced synthesized dsrna the
pns11 gene, abolished formation tubules, preventing direct
cell-to-cell spread rgdv without significant effects viral multiplication. 
all results show rgdv exploits virus-containing tubules facilitate 
viral spread among insect vector cells.
