viruses incorporate foreign glycoproteins form infectious particles
through process known pseudotyping. however, glycoproteins are
compatible viruses. despite fact viral pseudotyping widely
used, makes virus/glycoprotein pair compatible poorly understood. to
study this, chose analyze gammaretroviral glycoprotein (env) whose
compatibility different viruses could modulated small changes 
its cytoplasmic tail (ct). one form glycoprotein compatible with
murine leukemia virus (mlv) particles incompatible human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) particles, second compatible
with hiv-1 particles mlv particles. decipher factors
affecting virus-specific env incompatibility, characterized env incorporation,
maturation, cell-to-cell fusogenicity, virus-to-cell fusogenicity each
env. hiv-1 particle incompatibility correlated less efficient cleavage
of r peptide hiv-1 protease. however, mlv particle incompatibility was
more nuanced. mlv incompatibility appeared caused lack incorporation 
into particles, yet incorporation could restored truncating ct 
or using chimeric mlv gag protein containing hiv-1 without fully
restoring infectivity. mlv particle incompatibility appeared caused 
part fusogenic repression mlv particles unknown mechanism. 
study demonstrates env ct dictate functionality env within
particles virus-specific manner.importance viruses utilize viral
glycoproteins efficiently enter target cells infection. viruses
acquire viral glycoproteins studied understand pathogenesis of
viruses develop safer efficient viral vectors gene therapies.
the cts viral glycoproteins shown regulate various stages of
glycoprotein biogenesis, gap still remains understanding molecular
mechanism glycoprotein acquisition functionality regarding ct. here,
we studied mechanism specific mutations ct gammaretroviral
envelope glycoprotein distinctly affect infectivity two different viruses.
different mutations caused failure glycoproteins function a
virus-specific manner due distinct fusion defects, suggesting are
virus-specific characteristics affecting glycoprotein functionality.
