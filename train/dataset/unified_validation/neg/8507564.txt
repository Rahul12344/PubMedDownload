the differentiation potential lucké renal carcinoma northern
leopard frog, rana pipiens, characterized nuclear transplantation
procedure. transplantation tumor nuclei activated enucleated ova
results, best cases, swimming larvae fail feed. larvae 
die 10 14 days. rescue tumor nuclear transplantation tadpole
tissue, destined die, accomplished allografting fragments 
tissue normal hosts. allografts persist differentiate diversity of
tissues cannot distinguished histological analysis allografted
normal control tissue. allografts imperfect mode assay histological
competence immune response host. lymphocytes and
eosinophils invade grafts 40 days. host immune response occurs
in experimental control allografts. consequently, believe added 
histogenetic potential exists genome lucké renal carcinoma. we
propose unexpressed differentiative potential grafted tissue be
extracted abrogation immune response host. herpesvirus 
etiological agent lucké renal carcinoma. currently seek detect viral
dna tissue derived tumor nuclear transplant embryos. presence 
viral genetic material normal mitotic progeny lucké tumor cells, if
demonstrated, raises question long-term stability differentiated
cells derived virus tumor. alternatively, absence viral dna the
tumor nuclear transplant tissue would suggest normal differentiation ensues 
after elimination oncogenic dna tissue. loss viral dna may
prognosticate stable differentiation.
