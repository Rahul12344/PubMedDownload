naturally occurring newcastle disease virus (ndv) strains vary greatly in
virulence. presence multibasic residues proteolytic cleavage site
of fusion (f) protein shown primary determinant
differentiating virulent versus avirulent strains. however, wide
variation virulence among virulent strains. also examples of
incongruity cleavage site sequence virulence. observations
suggest additional viral factors contribute virulence. study, 
evaluated contribution viral gene virulence individually in
different combinations exchanging genes velogenic (highly virulent)
strain gb texas (gbt) mesogenic (moderately virulent) strain beaudette c
(bc). two strains phylogenetically closely related, f
proteins contain identical cleavage site sequences, (112)rrqkr↓f(117). total of
20 chimeric viruses constructed evaluated vitro, 1-day-old chicks,
and 2-week-old chickens. results showed envelope-associated 
and polymerase-associated proteins contribute difference virulence
between rbc rgbt, envelope-associated proteins playing greater
role. f protein major individual contributor sometimes
augmented homologous hn proteins. dramatic effect f was
independent cleavage site sequence since identical two
strains. polymerase l protein next major individual contributor and
was sometimes augmented homologous n p proteins. leader and
trailer regions appear contribute difference virulence
between bc gbt.importance: study first comprehensive and
systematic study ndv virulence pathogenesis. genetic exchanges a
mesogenic velogenic strain revealed fusion glycoprotein the
major virulence determinant regardless identical virulence protease
cleavage site sequence present strains. contribution large
polymerase protein ndv virulence second fusion
glycoprotein. identification virulence determinants considerable
importance, potential generate better live attenuated ndv
vaccines. may also possible apply findings other
paramyxoviruses.
