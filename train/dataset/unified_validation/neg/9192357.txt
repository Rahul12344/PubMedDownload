non-cytopathogenic (ncp) viruses bovine viral diarrhea (bvd) virus were
detected low ratio reverse plaque formation method virus samples
after several plaque clonings cytopathogenic (cp) bvd viruses; nadl osloss
strains. phenomenon suggests ncp bvd viruses produced low 
ratio propagation cp bvd viruses vitro. investigate the
differences parent cp bvd virus ncp bvd virus real
progeny, regions flanking insertion cellular mrna p125 domain
of nadl osloss strains amplified rt-pcr cloned pgem 3z
plasmid vector, sequenced. consequently, confirmed sequences
of cellular mrna insertion cp bvd viruses, nadl osloss strains, were
completely exactly deleted ncp bvd viruses real progeny
of cp bvd viruses, nadl osloss strains. results suggest ncp bvd
viruses may revert cp biotype ncp biotype deletion cellular
mrna insertion viral genome cp bvd viruses (nadl osloss strains).
