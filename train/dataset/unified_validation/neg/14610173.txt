kaposi's sarcoma (ks)-associated herpesvirus (kshv), human oncogenic
gamma-2-herpesvirus, transforms human endothelial cells establishes latent
infection low efficiency vitro. latent infection, limited
number genes expressed, circularized viral genome maintained as
a multicopy episome. latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana), exclusively
expressed latency, shown multifunctional role ks
pathogenesis. lana tethers viral episome host chromosome, thus
ensuring efficient persistence viral genome successive rounds of
cell division. besides episome maintenance, lana modulates expression of
genes various cellular viral pathways, including retinoblastoma
protein p53. herpesvirus saimiri (hvs), another gamma-2-herpesvirus,
primarily infects new world primates. orf73, encoding nuclear antigen hvs,
is positional homolog lana gene, orf73 protein some
sequence homology kshv lana. however, function orf73 hvs not
been thoroughly investigated. report, show hvs orf73 may be
important episome persistence colocalizes hvs genomic dna on
metaphase chromosomes. furthermore, hvs terminal repeats (trs) contain a
cis-acting sequence similar kshv trs, suggesting lana binding
sequence conserved two viruses. cis-acting element is
sufficient bind hvs orf73 strains c488 a11, plasmids containing
the hvs c488 tr element maintained replicate hvs c488 orf73-expressing
cells.
