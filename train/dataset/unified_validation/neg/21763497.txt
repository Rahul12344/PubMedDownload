signal transducers activator transcription (stat) proteins often
constitutively activated leukocytes hiv-1(+) individuals, frequently 
show dominant expression c-terminally truncated isoform stat5 (stat5δ).
stat5δ act negative regulator human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) expression cd8-depleted primary leukocytes chronically
infected promonocytic u1 cells stimulated granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf). activated stat5δ directly bind two
consensus sequences hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) promoter; binding
impairs recruitment rna polymerase ii (crotti, a., lusic, m., lupo, r.,
lievens, p. m., liboi, e., della chiara, g., et al. (2007). naturally occurring
c-terminally truncated stat5 negative regulator hiv-1 expression. blood, 
109, 5380-5389). one stat consensus sequences overlaps one nuclear
factor κb (nf-κb) binding site; interestingly, nf-κb1/p50 homodimers, frequently 
detected monocytic cells, negative regulators hiv transcription. here, 
we show gm-csf stimulation u1 cells, inducing nf-κb activation,
leads stat5δ phosphorylation binding nf-κb/stat target sequence 
the hiv ltr promoter, already associates p50 unstimulated
conditions. stat5δ found associate p50, rela/p65, in
both u1 cells expressing endogenous proteins 293t cells overexpressing 
factors. furthermore, gm-csf stimulation promoted concurrent binding stat5δ
and p50 hiv ltr promoter u1 cells. immunoprecipitation chromatin
from gm-csf-stimulated u1 cells confirmed vivo binding p50 viral
promoter together stat5δ. thus, cytokine-activated stat5δ/p50 complexes 
contribute maintenance hiv-1 latency monocytic cells.
