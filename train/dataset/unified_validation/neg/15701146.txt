during last decade, 'precautionary principle' health gained
importance. approach manage uncertain risks prevent damage
to environment human. key element take action, even cause 
and effect relationships fully established scientifically. although there
are also critics principle, meanwhile, also increasingly
implemented medicine. important subject medicinal products human or
animal origin. manifold official precaution-guided regulations stated
to improve safety, particularly avoid infection viruses and
pathogens causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. addition to
numerous regulations decisions, generally recommended substitute
animal human-derived products adequate alternatives wherever possible.
this great challenge research drug development. one option is
recombinant proteins, however, generally free risk of
contamination. therefore, best strategy might development of
synthetic, specifically acting drugs. widely used medicinal product of
animal origin present heparin. although indication any
viral contamination, many reasons suggest substitution alternative
antithrombotics. actually promoted research new anticoagulants. with
the approval fondaparinux, first synthetic, selective factor xa, first
alternative porcine-derived heparin become available. addition,
other synthetic antithrombotics currently clinical development. in
principle, thus possible prophylaxis therapy thromboembolic
diseases become completely independent animal-derived drugs, would 
be line precautionary principle.
