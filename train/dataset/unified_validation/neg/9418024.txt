the presence bacteriophages infecting enteric bacteria tested than
1500 drinking water samples israel spain. bacteriophages tested were
somatic coliphages, f-specific bacteriophages bacteroides fragilis
bacteriophages. three groups bacteriophage isolated 100 ml water
samples presence/absence test similar frequencies, ranged 
4.4% somatic coliphages 6.1% bacteriophages infecting bact. fragilis. 
in contrast, frequency isolation bacteriophages significantly
higher frequency isolation faecal coliforms, averaged only
1.9%. significant differences observed frequencies of
isolation samples tested spain tested israel. the
percentage groundwater samples containing faecal coliforms somatic
coliphages reduced significantly chlorination, despite known deficiencies.
however, effect occurrence f-specific bacteriophages and
bact. fragilis bacteriophages.
