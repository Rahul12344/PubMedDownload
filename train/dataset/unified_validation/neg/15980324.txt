beta-d-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-oxa-5-fluorocytidine (d-fdoc) effective inhibitor
of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1) hiv-2, simian immunodeficiency
virus, hepatitis b virus (hbv) vitro. purpose study to
evaluate intracellular metabolism d-fdoc human hepatoma (hepg2), human 
t-cell lymphoma (cem), primary human peripheral blood mononuclear (pbm) cells
by using tritiated compound. 24 h, levels d-fdoc-triphosphate
(d-fdoc-tp) 2.8 +/- 0.4, 6.7 +/- 2.3, 2.0 +/- 0.1 pmol/10(6) cells in
hepg2, cem, primary human pbm cells, respectively. intracellular d-fdoc-tp
concentrations remained greater 50% inhibitory concentration hiv-1
reverse transcriptase 24 h removal drug cell
cultures. addition d-fdoc-monophosphate (d-fdoc-mp), -diphosphate
(d-fdoc-dp), -tp, d-fdoc-dp-ethanolamine d-fdoc-dp-choline detected 
in cell extracts major intracellular metabolites. d-fdoc a
substrate escherichia coli thymidine phosphorylase. toxicity observed 
in mice given d-fdoc intraperitoneally 6 days dose 100 mg/kg per
day. pharmacokinetic studies rhesus monkeys indicated d-fdoc t(1/2)
of 2.1 h plasma oral bioavailability 38%. nucleoside was
excreted unchanged primary urine, metabolites detected in
plasma urine. results suggest safety pharmacological
studies warranted assess potential nucleoside the
treatment hiv- hbv-infected individuals.
