there 350 million chronic carriers hepatitis b virus (hbv) the
world, third eventually develop severe hbv-related complications.
hbv contributes liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma development.
remarkable progress made selective inhibition hbv replication by
nucleoside analogs. however, generate protective antibody hbsab in
hbv-infected patients hbv-dna becomes negative still remains challenge
for scientists. study, show ompc-hbsag 'a' epitope chimeric
protein vaccine break hbv tolerance induce protective immunity hbv
transgenic mice based mimicking cell-independent antigen bypass cells
from adaptive immune system. antibodies induced vaccine the
ability prevent hbv virion infection human hepatocytes.
