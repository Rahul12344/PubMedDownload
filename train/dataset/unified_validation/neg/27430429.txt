epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection tumor cells usually restricted the
latent form, indicating induction viral lytic infection may present a
novel approach treatment ebv‑associated tumors. contrast, ebv lytic
replication inhibited high‑levels nuclear factor (nf)‑κb, suggests
that nf‑κb inhibitors may activate lytic replication latent form. the
current study, addition nf‑κb inhibitors (bay11‑7082, z‑llf‑cho and
aspirin) observed induce ebv lytic genes bzlf1, brlf1 bmrf1 in
ebv‑positive gastric cancer (gc) cells. ebv‑positive ‑negative gc cells 
were treated different concentrations anti‑herpes agents the
cytotoxic effects measured different time points following induction of
ebv lytic replication. marginal dose‑ time‑dependent reduction cell
viability observed ebv‑positive and‑negative gc cells. cytotoxic
effects nf‑κb inhibitors ebv‑positive gc cells enhanced the
addition anti‑herpes agents, ganciclovir, acyclovir, foscarnet and
brivudine (p<0.05). however, significant synergistic effect on
ebv‑negative gc cells. combination 5 mm aspirin ganciclovir exhibited 
the highest cytotoxic effect ebv‑positive gc cells (cc50=7.2 µg/ml).
