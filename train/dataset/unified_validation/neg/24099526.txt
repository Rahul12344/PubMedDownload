background: ducks natural reservoir influenza virus central 
host highly pathogenic avian influenza (h5n1), domestic ducks rearing
in semi-scavenging system could serve re-assortment vessels re-emerging
new subtypes influenza viruses birds human. avian influenza virus
(aiv) surveillance bangladesh passive, relying poultry farmers 
report suspected outbreaks highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza. here, results
of active surveillance effort focusing semi-scavenging ducks are
presented.
result: total 2100 cloacal swabs 2100 sera collected from
semi-scavenging ducks three wintering-sites bangladesh three
successive winter seasons, december february years 2009
and 2012. virus isolation identification carried cloacal
swabs virus propagation embryonated hen eggs followed amplification of
viral rna using avian influenza virus (aiv) specific rt-pcr. overall
prevalence avian influenza type 22.05% swab samples 39.76% ducks
were sero-positive avian influenza type antibody. extremely low
sero-prevalence (0.09%) aiv h5n1 detected.
conclusions: based surveillance results, conclude semi-scavenging 
ducks bangladesh might play important role transmitting avian influenza
virus (aiv) type a. however, current risk infection humans from
domestic ducks bangladesh negligible. believe relatively large
dataset three winters bangladesh might create strong foundation for
future studies aiv prevalence, evolution, ecology wintering sites
around globe.
