this report describes 4 patients presenting multiple teeth affected by
invasive cervical resorption (icr). cases came attention 2006 
and 2008; previously, cases multiple icr (micr) reported in
switzerland. characteristics common 4 cases included progression of
disease time, similar clinical radiographic appearance lesions, and
obscure etiology. histologically assessed teeth showed similar pattern of
tooth destruction, resorptive lesions confined cervical region.
howship's lacunae multinucleated, tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase-positive odontoclasts detected. none teeth presented with
internal resorption. positive pulp sensitivity corresponded histologic
findings, indicating pulp tissue resisted degradation even advanced
stages resorptive lesions. although micr rare humans, similar disease 
known feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions (forl) common domestic,
captive, wild cats. etiology forl, like micr, remains largely 
unknown. forl associated feline viruses, asked micr 
patients whether contact cats, interestingly, patients 
reported direct (2 cases) indirect (2 cases) contact. addition, 
blood samples taken patients neutralization testing feline
herpes virus type 1 (fehv-1). indeed, sera obtained able neutralize
(2 cases) partly inhibit (2 cases) replication fehv-1, indicating
transmission feline viruses humans. future studies micr (and forl)
should evaluate possible role (feline) virus etiologic (co-)factor
in disease.
