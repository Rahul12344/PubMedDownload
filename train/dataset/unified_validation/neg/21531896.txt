recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (rrp) caused human papillomavirus type
6 (hpv-6) hpv-11. specific hla-dr haplotypes drb1*01:02 drb1*03:01 are
associated development rrp, disease severity, th2-like responses 
to hpv early proteins. th1-like responses hpv proteins shown be
protective animal models. therefore, investigated hypothesis rrp
patients dysfunctional th1-like, hpv-specific cell responses. using mhc
class ii tetramers, identified immunogenic peptides within hpv-11 early
proteins. two distinct peptides (e6(113-132) e2(1-20)) contained drb1*01:02- 
or drb1*03:01-restricted epitopes, respectively. additional peptide
(e2(281-300)) contained epitope presented alleles. peptide binding,
tetramer, proliferation assays identified minimal epitopes within these
peptides. epitopes elicited e2/e6-specific cd4(+) cell responses rrp
patients healthy control subjects, allowing isolation hpv-specific t
cell lines using tetramers. cytokine profiles stat signaling these
tetramer-positive cells measured compare polarization and
responsiveness hpv-specific cells patients rrp healthy
subjects. hpv-specific ifn-γ secretion substantially lower cells from
rrp patients. hpv-specific il-13 secretion seen modest levels cells
from rrp patients absent cells healthy control subjects.
hpv-specific cells rrp patients exhibited reduced stat-5 phosphorylation
and reduced il-2 secretion, suggesting anergy. levels stat-5 phosphorylation
and ifn-γ secretion could improved addition il-2 hpv-specific 
cell lines rrp patients. therapeutic vaccination interventions aimed at
restoring th1-like cytokine responses hpv proteins reversing anergy could 
improve clinical outcomes rrp patients.
