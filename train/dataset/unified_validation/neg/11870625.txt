natural killer (nk) cell receptors classical mhc class molecules are
encoded killer ig-like receptor (kir) multigene family humans other
primates. mouse nk cells, however, employ completely different multigene
family, c-type lectin-like ly49 genes, perform function. this
example functional convergent evolution raises question type of
receptors found non-primate non-rodent mammals. screening bovine 
spleen cdna library, isolated ly49 gene cow (bos taurus) show 
by genomic southern blotting likely single copy gene this
species. coding region intact immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibition motif (itim) cytoplasmic domain, suggesting role an
inhibitory receptor. also identified several bovine cdna clones related
to kir show least one intact open reading frame two itim.
evidence multiple kir-like genes cow obtained southern blotting
and found least two genes contain ancient retro-element
present human kir genes. results suggest cow primate
kirgene families arose common ancestral gene amplified independently. 
furthermore, findings indicate existence multiple ly49 genes
may phenomenon unique rodents.
