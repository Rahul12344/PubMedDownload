objective: il-18 pluripotent cytokine implicated the
development rheumatoid arthritis. soluble form il-18 receptor
accessory protein (sil-18rbeta) unknown function recently been
identified. study examined ability sil-18rbeta inhibit il-18
biological activities modulate immune responses collagen-induced
arthritis (cia).
methods: adenoviruses encoding sil-18rbeta administered intravenously in
type ii collagen-immunised dba/1 mice. humoral responses analysed by
determining anti-bovine collagen type ii (bcii) antibody levels elisa.
cytokine production splenic cells cytokine levels serum measured
by luminex multi-analyte technology. cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) regulatory cells
(treg) measured flow cytometry.
results: intravenous delivery ad5.sil-18rbeta collagen-immunised mice led
to enhanced transgene expression splenic antigen-presenting cells (apc). a
co-culture sil-18rbeta-transduced apc purified splenic cd3(+) t
cells led marked inhibition il-18-induced ifngamma, il-4 il-17
production cd3(+) cells. remarkably, systemic treatment ad5.sil-18rbeta
caused exacerbation arthritis, histological evaluation knee joints
showed increased cartilage bone erosion. significant differences were
observed anti-bcii antibodies, aggravation accompanied by
decreased ifngamma (-30%) il-4 (-44%) increased il-17 (+84%) production
by splenic cd3(+) cells. addition, reduced circulating levels of
cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) treg anti-inflammatory il-10 shown.
conclusion: study identifies sil-18rbeta novel il-18 inhibitor, which
promotes cia intravenous overexpression affecting treg levels and
supporting helper type 17 response.
