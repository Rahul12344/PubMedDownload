dimethyl sulfate (dms) genomic footprinting revealed presence putative
regulatory proteins attached specific sequences promoter region 
interferon (ifn) alpha-1 gene normal human tissue. pattern protein-dna 
interactions observed human alpha-1 promoter freshly isolated human
spleen cells identical seen dna b-cell line namalwa. 
protein interactions involving human ifn alpha-1 promoter spanned region
from positions -38 -174 relative cap site encompasses part
of ifn alpha-1 promoter previously shown deletion analysis confer virus
inducibility ifn alpha-1 gene. dnase footprinting performed isolated 
nuclei revealed pattern protein-dna interactions promoter region 
the ifn alpha-1 gene similar obtained dms footprinting performed 
whole cells, appearance disappearance additional
protected nucleotides outside region identified use dms. these
results provide first direct evidence presence proteins bound in
vivo parts ifn alpha-1 promoter positions -64 -109
previously shown deletion analysis confer virus inducibility ifn
alpha-1 gene. pattern protein-dna interactions observed ifn
alpha-1 promoter virus induction identical seen before
induction, keeping finding many transcriptional activators are
present induced uninduced cells.
