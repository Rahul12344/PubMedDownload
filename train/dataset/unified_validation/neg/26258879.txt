the production high affinity, class switched antibodies produced b cells
hinges effective differentiation follicular helper (tfh) cells. 
we define conditions specifically enhancing tfh differentiation providing
protection model influenza infection. tfh responses associated 
prolonged antigen presentation dendritic cells (dcs), maintained t
cell/dc interactions stage 3 (&gt;72 hr) activation. blocking stage 3
interactions ablated tfh generation, demonstrating causal link t
cell-dc behaviour functional outcomes. current data therefore explain how
duration antigen presentation affects dynamics cell-dc interactions
and consequently determine tfh cell differentiation developing immune
response.
