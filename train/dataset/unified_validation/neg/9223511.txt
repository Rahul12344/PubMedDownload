pvc-211 murine leukemia virus (mulv) causes neurodegenerative disease following
inoculation neonatal, adult, mice rats. previously shown
that tropism brain capillary endothelial cells (cec) determinant the
viral neuropathogenicity. study, demonstrate host age-dependent
replication pvc-211 mulv vivo occurs cec brain well in
other organs, liver, kidney, heart. contrast, primary explant 
cultures cec derived brains livers adult neonatal rats could
be infected pvc-211 mulv, suggesting age-dependent susceptibility was
abrogated vitro. although cec generally less susceptible mulv-mediated
gene transduction fibroblasts, treatment cec 2-deoxyglucose followed
by inoculation pvc-211 mulv-pseudotyped vector absence heparin
improved transduction efficiency. observations support possibility 
that pvc-211 mulv may useful establishing models cec gene transduction.
