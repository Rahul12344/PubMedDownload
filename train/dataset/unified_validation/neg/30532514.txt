context: chronic infection hepatitis c virus causes impairment in
neurocognitive function 50% patients may detected by
clinical tests.
aim: early detection neurocognitive impairment chronic hepatitis c patients
and investigating cognitive function hcv patient p300 clinical
test.
materials methods: study included 60 patients chronic hepatitis c
and 30 healthy controls. participants subjected biochemical,
hematological assessment, mini-mental state examination, montreal cognitive
assessment, p300, polymerase chain reaction (pcr), fibroscan made for
hepatitis c patients.
results: digit span, attention, concentration, memory significantly 
lower patients controls. delayed p300 peak latency reduction 
of amplitude significantly evident patients liver fibrosis 
the controls patients without fibrosis. abnormalities were
significantly higher increasing grade fibrosis. patients with
cognitive impairment (reduced mini-mental state score) abnormal p300-evoked
responses. p300 could detect neurocognitive impairment patients with
normal neurocognitive functions clinical test. p300 sensitivity (100%),
specificity (59.26), positive predictive value (75%), negative predictive value
(100%), accuracy (81.67) detection neurocognitive impairment hcv
patient.
conclusion: patients chronic hepatitis c infection significant
impairment cognitive functions. impairment increases the
increase grade hepatic fibrosis. p300 detect minimal subclinical
impairment cognitive function early stages chronic hepatitis with
accuracy (81.67).
trial registration: pactr 19 march 2018 retrospectively. identification number
for registry pactr201804003215168.
