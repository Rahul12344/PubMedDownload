the discovery autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemic patients mutations 
in pcsk9 gene, encoding proprotein convertase narc-1, resulting the
missense mutations suggested role low density lipoprotein (ldl) metabolism. 
we show endoplasmic reticulum-localized pronarc-1 narc-1 zymogen
conversion ca2+-independent within zymogen autocatalytic
processing site ssvfaq [downward arrow]sip val p4 pro p3' critical.
the s127r d374y mutations result approximately 50-60% > =98%
decrease zymogen processing, respectively. contrast, double [d374y +
n157k], f216l, r218s natural mutants resulted normal zymogen processing.
the cell surface ldl receptor (ldlr) levels reduced 35% lymphoblasts of
s127r patients. ldlr levels also reduced stable hepg2 cells
overexpressing narc-1 natural mutant s127r, reduction is
abrogated presence 5 mm ammonium chloride, suggesting that
overexpression narc-1 increases turnover rate ldlr. adenoviral
expression wild type human narc-1 mice resulted maximal approximately 
9-fold increase circulating ldl cholesterol, ldlr-/- mice delayed
approximately 2-fold increase ldl cholesterol observed. conclusion,
narc-1 seems affect level ldlr circulating
apob-containing lipoproteins ldlr-dependent -independent fashion.
