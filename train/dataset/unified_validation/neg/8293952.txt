we present sequence open reading frame (orf) 3' end human
astrovirus serotype 1. primer extension experiments showed rna
expressing gene shorter complete orf, could form protein
of m(r) 85,540. protein expressed recombinant baculovirus was
recognized anti-virion serum, indicating structural role. sequence
comparison indicates astrovirus serotypes 1 2 differ markedly the
c-terminal half protein well conserved towards n-terminus.
