a series 2'-deoxy analogues antiviral agent
5,6-dichloro-2-isopropylamino-1-(beta-l-ribofuranosyl)-1h-benzimidazole (1263w94)
were synthesized evaluated activity human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) 
and cytotoxicity. 2-substituents benzimidazole moiety correspond
to used 1263w94 series. general, found the
1263w94 series, cyclic branched alkylamino groups needed potent
activity hcmv. three analogues 3a, 3b 3d potent 1263w94.
further evaluation two analogues, 3a 3b, suggested 2'-deoxy
analogues may act via novel mechanism action similar 1263w94.
these 2'-deoxy analogues generally lacked cytotoxicity vitro. pharmacokinetic 
parameters mice protein binding properties 3a quite similar to
1263w94. however, oral bioavailability 3a half observed
for 1263w94.
