hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) common, life-threatening complication of
longstanding infection hepatitis c virus (hcv), likely consequence 
the direct oncogenic activity virus cooperating liver cell
inflammation transforming liver mitogenic mutagenic
environment. achievement sustained virological response (svr) to
interferon-based therapies shown benefit course hepatitis c in
terms reduced rates liver-related complications mortality all
causes. interestingly, achievement svr associated a
negligible risk developing clinical decompensation years, risk of
hcc fully abrogated following hcv clearance, remains dominant
complication svr populations. factors accounting residual
risk hcc svr patients fully understood, yet persistence 
subverted architecture liver, diabetes alcohol abuse likely
culprits. end, risk developing hcc svr patients attenuated
by 75% compared non-responders untreated patients, whereas responders who
develop hcc may stratified different categories hcc risk score
based demographic liver disease-based variables, those
that predict liver cancer viremic patients. all, prevents full
understanding factors drive hcc risk hcv eradicated. 
here, critically review current understanding hcc svr patients focusing 
on factors predict residual risk hcc among patients providing a
glimpse expected benefits new anti-hcv regimens based direct
antiviral agents.
