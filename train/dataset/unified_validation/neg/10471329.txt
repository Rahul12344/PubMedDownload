neurons withdraw cell cycle immediately differentiation their
proliferative precursors. e2f1, principal transcription factor promotes
cell cycle progression, must silenced neurons. investigated e2f1
system postmitotic neurons derived murine embryonal carcinoma p19 cells. 
p19 cells highly expressed e2f1 gene neural differentiation, and
enriched neurons contained high abundance e2f1 mrna. contrast,
postmitotic neurons possessed extremely low levels e2f1 protein assessed by
the electrophoretic mobility shift assay western blotting. recombinant e2f1
fusion protein ubiquitinated vitro incubated neuronal lysates.
in addition, treatment proteasome inhibitor mg132 increased the
endogenous level e2f1 protein neurons. results suggest the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway contributes, least part, downregulation
of e2f1 protein postmitotic neurons. adenovirus-mediated transfer e2f1 cdna
into postmitotic neurons induced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and
chromatin condensation, suggesting deregulated e2f1 expression causes both
aberrant s-phase entry apoptosis postmitotic neurons. thus, downregulation
of endogenous e2f1 protein postmitotic neurons may indispensable the
prevention reentry cell cycle.
