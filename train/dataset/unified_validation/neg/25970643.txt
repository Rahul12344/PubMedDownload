several types cutaneous reactions reported arise site of
herpes zoster (hz) infection weeks years acute disease. among these,
granulomatous reactions frequently reported. study, we
describe spectrum histopathologic findings hz granulomatous reactions
observed 26 patients cutaneous lesions confined area previous
hz eruption compare biopsy specimens taken 25 patients with
acute hz. patients persistent reactions history available 
presented within 12 weeks onset acute eruption. frequent
findings interstitial granulomatous dermatitis lymphocytes, histiocytes
and multinucleated giant cells displaying elastophagocytosis perineural,
perivascular perieccrine mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate rich in
lymphocytes plasma cells. less common features included intra-arrector and
peri-arrector pili granulomas, follicular dilatation hyperkeratosis, and
vasculitis. specimens patients acute hz found small
numbers perineural plasma cells subtle granulomatous
inflammation, patterns similar group late granulomatous reactions.
our findings suggest granulomatous reactions varicella zoster virus
