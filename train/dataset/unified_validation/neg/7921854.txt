sera patients suffering acute hepatitis, different forms chronic
hepatitis found reactive reagents prepared yellow fever
virus (yf) vaccine strain. serum samples 1974 patients tested, 133 of
them positive. hepatitis c virus specific antibodies absent the
majority them. frequency antibodies flaviviruses (tick-borne
encephalitis, west nile) hepatitis b virus markers similar that
measured among population hungary positive surrogate
markers hepatitis infections. results immunofluorescence tests, and
western blots suggest non-a, non-b, non-c hepatitis virus
circulating among hungarian population, possesses antigenic
cross-reactivity yellow fever virus, identity the
known flaviviruses could verified yet. history yellow fever
vaccination could revealed patients included study.
the anamnestic data previous transfusions surgical operations be
verified case half yfv-positive patients, nevertheless, the
sexual transmission seems infrequent. attempts continued order 
to detect viral rna using polymerase chain reaction, clone cdna sequences
for sequence analysis.
