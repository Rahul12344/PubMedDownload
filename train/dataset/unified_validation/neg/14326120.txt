ontogenesis human smallpox virus.

avakyan aa, byckovsky af.

the vegetative stage development human smallpox virus described as
being comprised four successive periods: "without membrane" period;
"open-cavity" period; "single-cavity" period; "double-cavity" period. this
classification based organization virus membranes. paper
presents description changes virus structure period. it
shows strict sequence morphological continuity succession of
differentiation viral components. important stage development,
the differentiation virus nucleoid, takes place virus cavity
morphologically isolated cellular milieu limited originally the
external membrane virus second one, primary membrane
of nucleoid. osmiophilic fibrils 20 25 wide, fill cavity 
mature nucleoid, become clearly evident staining uranyl acetate and
are revealed end last double-cavity period. main
features developmental cycle human smallpox virus may probably be
characteristic certain groups viruses.
