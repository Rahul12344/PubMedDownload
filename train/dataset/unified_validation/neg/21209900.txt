monkeypox zoonotic viral disease occurs primarily central west
africa. recent outbreak united states heightened public health concerns 
for susceptible human populations. vaccinating vaccinia virus prevent
smallpox also effective monkeypox due high degree sequence
conservation. yet, identity antigens within monkeypox virus proteome
contributing immune responses described detail. compared
antibody responses monkeypox virus infection human smallpox vaccination by
using protein microarray covering 92-95% (166-192 proteins) representative
proteomes monkeypox viral clades central west africa, including 92%
coverage (250 proteins) vaccinia virus proteome reference orthopox
vaccine. viral gene clones verified sequencing purified
recombinant proteins used construct microarray. serum igg of
cynomolgus macaques recovered monkeypox recognized least 23 separate
proteins within orthopox proteome, 14 proteins were
recognized igg vaccinated humans. 12 14 antigens detected
by sera human vaccinees also recognized igg convalescent
macaques. greatest level igg binding macaques occurred the
structural proteins f13l a33r, membrane scaffold protein d13l.
significant igm responses directed towards a44r, f13l a33r monkeypox virus
were detected onset clinical symptoms macaques. thus, antibodies
from vaccination recognized small number proteins shared pathogenic
virus strains, recovery infection also involved humoral responses to
antigens uniquely recognized within monkeypox virus proteome.
