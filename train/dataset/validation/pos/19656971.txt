The matrix (M1) protein of influenza A virus is a conserved multifunctional
protein that plays essential roles in regulating the viral life cycle. This study
demonstrated that M1 is able to interact with complement C1qA and plays an
important inhibitory function in the classical complement pathway. The N-terminal
domain of M1 protein was required for its binding to the globular region of C1qA.
As a consequence, M1 blocked the interaction between C1qA and heat-aggregated IgG
in vitro and inhibited haemolysis. It was shown that M1 protein prevented the
complement-mediated neutralization of influenza virus in vitro. In addition,
studies on mice indicated that the administration of M1 could promote a higher
virus propagation rate in lung and shortened survival of mice infected with the
virus. Taken together, these results suggest strongly that the M1 protein plays a
critical role in protecting influenza virus from the host innate immune system.
