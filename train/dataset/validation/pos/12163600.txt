Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) plays a significant role in the
development of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and some forms of
multicentric Castleman's disease. The KSHV open reading frame K9 encodes the
viral interferon (IFN) factor 1 (vIRF1), which downregulates IFN- and
IRF-mediated transcriptional activation, and leads to cellular transformation in 
rodent fibroblasts and induction of tumors in nude mice. Using the yeast
two-hybrid assay, we identified genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced
mortality-19 (GRIM19), which interacts directly with vIRF1, both in vivo and in
vitro. The N-terminal region of vIRF1 is required for binding GRIM19.
Colocalization of vIRF1 and GRIM19 was observed in 293T cells. The vIRF1 protein 
deregulates GRIM19-induced apoptosis in the presence of IFN/all-trans-retinoic
acid (RA) and inhibits IFN/RA-induced cell death. Another DNA tumor viral
protein, human papillomavirus type 16 E6, also binds GRIM19, suggesting that this
is a general target of viral proteins. Our results collectively indicate that
vIRF1 modulates IFN/RA-cell death signals via interactions with GRIM19.
