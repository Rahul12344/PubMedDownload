Molecular mimicry of cytokines and cytokine receptors is a strategy used by
poxviruses and herpesviruses to modulate host immunity. The human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) UL144 gene, situated in the UL/b' region of the viral genome, has
amino-acid sequence similarity to members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor 
superfamily. We report that UL144 is a potent activator of NFkappaB-induced
transcription in a TRAF6-dependent manner. This NFkappaB activation enhances
expression of the chemokine CCL22 through the NFkappaB responsive elements found 
in its promoter. In contrast to the clinical HCMV isolates, extensively passaged 
laboratory strains lack the UL/b' region and hence do not encode UL144.
Consistent with this, infection with viruses that carry UL/b' causes NFkappaB
activation and CCL22 expression, a phenotype that is not observed after
infections with strains lacking the UL/b' region. Moreover, knockdown of UL144,
TRAF6 or NFkappaB by specific siRNA in infections with UL144-encoding HCMV
prevents the activation of CCL22 expression normally observed after infection
with UL/b' positive HCMV. Upregulation of CCL22, which attracts Th2 and
regulatory T cells, may help HCMV evade immune surveillance.
