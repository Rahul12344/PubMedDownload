Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a pathogenic human virus whose RNA genome and
replication cycle resemble those of plant viroids. However, viroid genomes
contain no open reading frames, whereas HDV RNA encodes a single protein,
hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), which is required for viral replication. A
cellular gene whose product interacts with HDAg has now been identified, and this
interaction was found to affect viral genomic replication in intact cells. DNA
sequence analysis revealed that this protein, termed delta-interacting protein A 
(DIPA), is a cellular homolog of HDAg. These observations demonstrate that a host
gene product can modulate HDV replication and suggest that HDV may have evolved
from a primitive viroidlike RNA through capture of a cellular transcript.
