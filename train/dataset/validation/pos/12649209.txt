By means of the yeast two-hybrid system, we have discovered a novel physical
interaction between the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein and Ran, a small GTPase which 
regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell cycle progression, and mitotic
spindle organization. Expression of E1A elicits induction of S phase and
centrosome amplification in a variety of rodent cell lines. The induction of
supernumerary centrosomes requires functional RCC1, the nucleotide exchange
factor for Ran and, hence, a functional Ran network. The E1A portion responsible 
for the interaction with Ran is the extreme NH(2)-terminal region (amino acids
1-36), which is also required for the induction of centrosome amplification. In
an in vitro assay with recombinant proteins, wild-type E1A interferes with
nucleotide exchange on Ran, whereas an E1A mutant, deleted from the extreme
NH(2)-terminal region, does not. In addition, we detected an in vitro interaction
between Ran and HPV-16 E7 and SV40 large T antigen, two oncoproteins functionally
related to E1A. These findings suggest a common pathway of these oncoproteins in 
eliciting virus-induced genomic instability.
