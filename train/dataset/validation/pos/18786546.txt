Like all retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergoes
reverse transcription during its replication cycle. The cellular cofactors
potentially involved in this process still remain to be identified. We show here 
that A-kinase anchoring protein 149 (AKAP149) interacts with HIV-1 reverse
transcriptase (RT) in both the yeast two-hybrid system and human cells. The
AKAP149 binding site has been mapped to the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT. AKAP149
silencing by RNA interference in HIV-1-infected cells inhibited viral replication
at the reverse transcription step. We selected single-point mutants of RT
defective for AKAP149 binding and demonstrated that mutant G462R, despite
retaining significant intrinsic RT activity in vitro, failed to carry out HIV-1
reverse transcription correctly in infected cells. This suggests that the
interaction between RT and AKAP149 in infected cells may play an important role
in HIV-1 reverse transcription.
