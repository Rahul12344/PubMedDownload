We previously reported that hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) inhibits
production of interleukin 6 by suppressing NF-κB activation. NF-κB is known to be
activated through receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2),
and we examined the mechanisms of interleukin 6 regulation by HBeAg. HBeAg
inhibits RIPK2 expression and interacts with RIPK2, which may represent 2
mechanisms through which HBeAg blocks nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain-containing protein 1 ligand-induced NF-κB activation in HepG2 cells. Our
findings identified novel molecular mechanisms whereby HBeAg modulates
intracellular signaling pathways by targeting RIPK2, supporting the concept that 
HBeAg could impair both innate and adaptive immune responses to promote chronic
HBV infection.
