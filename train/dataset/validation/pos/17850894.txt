Ficolins are collagenous lectins that bind N-acetylated glycans and participate
in innate immune responses, including phagocytosis and complement activation.
Related collagenous lectins such as mannan binding lectin (MBL) and surfactant
proteins A and D possess antiviral activity, but this activity has not been
demonstrated for ficolins. In these studies, we used purified porcine plasma
ficolin alpha and recombinant ficolin alpha to assess their ability to bind and
neutralize porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) in various assays. 
Recombinant ficolin alpha was designed with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag using a 
pcDNA3.1 expression vector system in CHO K1 cells. Plasma-purified and
recombinant ficolin alpha reduced cytopathic effect of PRRSV-infected Marc-145
cells in neutralization assays and inhibited replication of infectious viral
particles in a GlcNAc-dependent manner. In vitro replication determined by plaque
assay was inhibited in the presence of plasma-purified ficolin alpha and
recombinant ficolin. Immunoreactive plasma ficolin alpha and recombinant ficolin 
alpha also bound PRRSV-coated wells in a GlcNAc-dependent manner. These studies
indicate that porcine ficolin can bind and neutralize a common arterivirus that
is a major pathogen of swine.
