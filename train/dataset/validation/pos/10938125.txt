The E7 protein encoded by human papillomavirus type 16 is one of the few viral
genes that can immortalize primary human cells and thereby override cellular
senescence. While it is generally assumed that this property of E7 depends on its
interaction with regulators of the cell cycle, we show here that E7 targets
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the product of a
p53-inducible gene that is overexpressed in senescent cells. IGFBP-3 can suppress
cell proliferation and induce apoptosis; we show here that IGFBP-3-mediated
apoptosis is inhibited by E7, which binds to IGFBP-3 and triggers its proteolytic
cleavage. Two transformation-deficient mutants of E7 failed to inactivate
IGFBP-3, suggesting that inactivation of IGFBP-3 may contribute to cell
transformation.
