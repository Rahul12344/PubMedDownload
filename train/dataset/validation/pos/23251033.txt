The HIV-1 Tat protein stimulates viral gene expression by recruiting human
transcription elongation complexes containing P-TEFb, AFF4, ELL2, and ENL or AF9 
to the viral promoter, but the molecular organization of these complexes remains 
unknown. To establish the overall architecture of the HIV-1 Tat elongation
complex, we mapped the binding sites that mediate complex assembly in vitro and
in vivo. The AFF4 protein emerges as the central scaffold that recruits other
factors through direct interactions with short hydrophobic regions along its
structurally disordered axis. Direct binding partners CycT1, ELL2, and ENL or AF9
act as bridging components that link this complex to two major elongation
factors, P-TEFb and the PAF complex. The unique scaffolding properties of AFF4
allow dynamic and flexible assembly of multiple elongation factors and connect
the components not only to each other but also to a larger network of
transcriptional regulators.
