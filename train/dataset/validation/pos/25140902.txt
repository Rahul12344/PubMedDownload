Mitochondria contribute to cellular innate immunity against RNA viruses.
Mitochondrial-mediated innate immunity is regulated by signalling molecules that 
are recruited to the mitochondrial membrane, and depends on the mitochondrial
inner membrane potential (Δψm). Here we examine the physiological relevance of
Δψm and the mitochondrial-associating influenza A viral protein PB1-F2 in innate 
immunity. When expressed in host cells, PB1-F2 completely translocates into the
mitochondrial inner membrane space via Tom40 channels, and its accumulation
accelerates mitochondrial fragmentation due to reduced Δψm. By contrast, PB1-F2
variants lacking a C-terminal polypeptide, which is frequently found in low
pathogenic subtypes, do not affect mitochondrial function. PB1-F2-mediated
attenuation of Δψm suppresses the RIG-I signalling pathway and activation of
NLRP3 inflammasomes. PB1-F2 translocation into mitochondria strongly correlates
with impaired cellular innate immunity, making this translocation event a
potential therapeutic target.
