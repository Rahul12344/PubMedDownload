BACKGROUND: During primary infection of its human host, Herpes Simplex Virus
Type-1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in neurons where the viral genome is
maintained in a circular form associated with nucleosomes in a chromatin
configration. During latency, most viral genes are silenced, although the
molecular mechanisms responsible for this are unclear. We hypothesized that
neuronal factors repress HSV-1 gene expression during latency. A search of the
HSV-1 DNA sequence for potential regulatory elements identified a Repressor
Element-1/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Element (RE-1/NRSE) located between HSV-1
genes ICP22 and ICP4. We predicted that the Repressor Element Silencing
Transcription Factor/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Factor (REST/NRSF) regulates
expression of ICP22 and ICP4.
RESULTS: Transient cotransfection indicated that REST/NRSF inhibited the activity
of both promoters. In contrast, cotransfection of a mutant form of REST/NRSF
encoding only the DNA-binding domain of the protein resulted in less inhibition. 
Stably transformed cell lines containing episomal reporter plasmids with a
chromatin structure showed that REST/NRSF specifically inhibited the ICP4
promoter, but not the ICP22 promoter. REST/NRSF inhibition of the ICP4 promoter
was reversed by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA).
Additionally, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that the
corepressor CoREST was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 promoter and that
acetylation of histone H4 was reduced in the presence of REST/NRSF.
CONCLUSION: Since the ICP4 protein is a key transactivator of HSV-1 lytic cycle
genes, these results suggest that REST/NRSF may have an important role in the
establishment and/or maintenance of HSV-1 gene silencing during latency by
targeting ICP4 expression.
