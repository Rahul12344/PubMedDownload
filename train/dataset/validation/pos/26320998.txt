Invading viral DNA can be recognized by the host cytosolic DNA sensor, cyclic
GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), resulting in production of the second messenger 
cGAMP, which directs the adaptor protein STING to stimulate production of type I 
interferons (IFNs). Although several DNA viruses are sensed by cGAS, viral
strategies targeting cGAS are virtually unknown. We report here that Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF52, an abundant
gammaherpesvirus-specific tegument protein, subverts cytosolic DNA sensing by
directly inhibiting cGAS enzymatic activity through a mechanism involving both
cGAS binding and DNA binding. Moreover, ORF52 homologs in other
gammaherpesviruses also inhibit cGAS activity and similarly bind cGAS and DNA,
suggesting conserved inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, KSHV infection evokes
cGAS-dependent responses that can limit the infection, and an ORF52 null mutant
exhibits increased cGAS signaling. Our findings reveal a mechanism through which 
gammaherpesviruses antagonize host cGAS DNA sensing.
