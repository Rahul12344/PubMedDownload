Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 is involved in pre-mRNA
splicing in the nucleus and translational regulation in the cytoplasm. The
cytoplasmic redistribution of hnRNP A1 is a regulated process during viral
infection and cellular stress. Here we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 not only is an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) trans-acting factor that binds specifically
to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and regulates
IRES-dependent translation but also binds to the 5' UTR of Sindbis virus (SV) and
facilitates its translation. The cytoplasmic relocalization of hnRNP A1 in
EV71-infected cells leads to the enhancement of EV71 IRES-mediated translation,
and its function can be substituted by hnRNP A2, whereas the cytoplasmic
relocalization of hnRNP A1 following SV infection enhances the SV translation,
but this function cannot be replaced by hnRNP A2. Our study provides the first
direct evidence that the cytoplasmic relocalization of hnRNP A1 controls not only
the IRES-dependent but also non-IRES-dependent translation initiations of RNA
viruses.
