The U(S)3 protein kinase of herpes simplex virus 1 plays a key role in blocking
apoptosis induced by viral gene products or exogenous agents. The U(S)3 protein
kinase is similar to protein kinase A with respect to substrate range and
specificity. We report that in the yeast two-hybrid system a domain of U(S)3
essential for antiapoptotic activity reacted with programmed cell death protein 4
(PDCD4). We report that U(S)3 interacts with PDCD4, that PDCD4 is
posttranslationally modified in infected cells both in a U(S)3-dependent and
-independent fashion, and that depletion of PDCD4 by siRNA blocked apoptosis
induced by a Δα4 mutant virus. In infected cells, PDCD4 accumulates in the
nucleus, whereas U(S)3 accumulates in the cytoplasm. Studies designed to
elucidate the convergence of these proteins led to the discovery that U(S)3
protein kinase cycles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that U(S)3 retains
PDCD4 in infected cell nuclei.
