The possible biochemical factors able to affect the in vitro expression of the
high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E7 oncoprotein have been analyzed.
Evidence is provided that E7 mRNA stability is increased and, conversely,
transcript translation is inhibited by binding to a 32-kDa protein from rabbit
reticulocyte lysate; sequence analysis identified the 32-kDa binding protein as
rabbit alpha(1)-globin protein; and interaction between rabbit alpha(1)-globin
and E7 mRNA occurs through the 6-mer peptide SEQIKA present in human cytokeratin 
7 protein. The in vitro data were confirmed by the occurrence of HPV16 E7
mRNA-cytokeratin 7 binding in squamous cervical cancer SiHa cells.
