Vaccinia virus intracellular mature virus (IMV) binds to glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs) on cells via three virion proteins, H3L, A27L, and D8L. In this study, we 
demonstrated that binding of IMV to BSC40 cells was competitively inhibited by
soluble laminin but not by fibronectin or collagen V, suggesting that this cell
surface extracellular matrix (ECM) protein may play a role in vaccinia virus
entry. Moreover, IMV infection of GAG(-) sog9 cells was also inhibited by
laminin, demonstrating that virion binding to laminin does not involve a prior
interaction with GAGs. Furthermore, comparative envelope protein analyses of
wild-type vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve, which binds to laminin, and of a
mutant virus, IA27L, which does not, showed that the A26L open reading frame
(ORF), encoding an envelope protein, was mutated in IA27L, resulting in A26L
being absent from the IMV. Expression of the wild-type A26L ORF in IA27L resulted
in laminin binding activity. Moreover, recombinant A26L protein bound to laminin 
in vitro with a high affinity, providing direct evidence that A26L is the laminin
binding protein on IMV. In summary, these results reveal a novel role for the
vaccinia viral envelope protein A26L in binding to the ECM protein laminin, an
association that is proposed to facilitate IMV entry.
