OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction between influenza A virus PB1-F2 and human
modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP-1).
METHODS: The recombinant plasmid pACT2-MOAP-1 was constructed and co-transformed 
into yeast AH109 with pGBKT7-PB1-F2. The growth of the co-transformants on
quadruple dropout medium and beta-galactosidase activity of the reporter gene
were tested. We further confirmed the interaction of cellular protein MOAP-1 and 
PB1-F2 by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation
(Co-IP) assays. In addition, we investigated the effect of PB1-F2 on MOAP-1
protein level by Western blot.
RESULTS: The results of yeast two-hybrid assay showed that MOAP-1 specifically
interacted with PB1-F2 in yeast cells. Furthermore, the binding of MOAP-1 with
PB1-F2 was demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and Co-IP assays. 
PB1-F2 could upregulate exogenous MOAP-1 protein level.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that influenza virus PB1-F2 interacted with
MOAP-1 and it might be involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis
via association with MOAP-1.
