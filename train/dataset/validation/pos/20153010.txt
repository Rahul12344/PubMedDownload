Nuclear Matrix and MARs have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of
host as well as viral genes but their precise role in HIV-1 transcription remains
unclear. Here, we show that >98% of HIV sequences contain consensus MAR element
in their promoter. We show that SMAR1 binds to the LTR MAR and reinforces
transcriptional silencing by tethering the LTR MAR to nuclear matrix. SMAR1
associated HDAC1-mSin3 corepressor complex is dislodged from the LTR upon
cellular activation by PMA/TNFalpha leading to an increase in the acetylation and
a reduction in the trimethylation of histones, associated with the recruitment of
RNA Polymerase II on the LTR. Overexpression of SMAR1 lead to reduction in LTR
mediated transcription, both in a Tat dependent and independent manner, resulting
in a decreased virion production. These results demonstrate the role of SMAR1 in 
regulating viral transcription by alternative compartmentalization of LTR between
the nuclear matrix and chromatin.
