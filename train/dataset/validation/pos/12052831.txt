Transcription of the highly pathogenic Ebola virus (EBOV) is dependent on VP30, a
constituent of the viral nucleocapsid complex. Here we present evidence that
phosphorylation of VP30, which takes place at six N-terminal serine residues and 
one threonine residue, is of functional significance. Replacement of the
phosphoserines by alanines resulted in an only slightly phosphorylated VP30
(VP30(6A)) that is still able to activate EBOV-specific transcription in a
plasmid-based minigenome system. VP30(6A), however, did not bind to inclusions
that are induced by the major nucleocapsid protein NP. Three intracellular
phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, and PP2C) have been determined to dephosphorylate VP30. 
The presence of okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, had the same
negative effect on transcription activation by VP30 as the substitution of the
six phosphoserines for aspartate residues. OA, however, did not impair
transcription when VP30 was replaced by VP30(6A). In EBOV-infected cells, OA
blocked virus growth dose-dependently. The block was mediated by the extensive
phosphorylation of VP30, which is evidenced by the result that expression of
VP30(6A), in trans, led to the progression of EBOV infection in the presence of
OA. In conclusion, phosphorylation of VP30 was shown to regulate negatively
transcription activation and positively binding to the NP inclusions.
