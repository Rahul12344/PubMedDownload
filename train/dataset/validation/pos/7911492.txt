The mechanism of CD4+ cell depletion in HIV-infected patients is poorly
understood. In this study we investigated whether rgp120 can activate the
complement system in the absence of anti-gp120 Abs. We found that the complement 
proteins C4, C3d, C5b-9, and properdin bind to rgp 120-coated CD4+ T cells of
healthy individuals when incubated in autologous serum. Activation of the
complement system occurred primarily via the classical pathway and was abolished 
in sera deficient in C1q and C4 as well as in the presence of EDTA. No cell lysis
was observed in a lymphocytotoxicity assay using human serum, possibly because of
homologous restriction of complement lysis. In contrast, addition of rabbit sera 
induced lysis of the rgp 120-precoated cells. Cell lysis by rabbit serum was
found to be because of naturally occurring IgM anti-gp 120 Abs. The rgp 120,
which was immobilized on the surface of microtiter plates activated complement in
the absence of lymphocytes. Complement activation by cell-bound HIV-1 envelope
glycoprotein gp120 with subsequent opsonization may be relevant for the
elimination of noninfected CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected patients.
