Ligand activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)
has been reported to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in various cancers
including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the effect of hepatitis B
virus X protein (HBx) on PPARgamma activation has not been characterized in
hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC. Herein, we demonstrated that HBx
counteracted growth inhibition caused by PPARgamma ligand in HBx-associated HCC
cells. We found that HBx bound to DNA binding domain of PPARgamma and
HBx/PPARgamma interaction blocked nuclear localization and binding to recognition
site of PPARgamma. HBx significantly suppressed a PPARgamma-mediated
transactivation. These results suggest that HBx modulates PPARgamma function
through protein-protein interaction.
