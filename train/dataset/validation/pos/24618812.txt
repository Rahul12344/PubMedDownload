Previously we reported that nuclear export of both unspliced and spliced murine
leukemia virus (MLV) transcripts depends on the nuclear export factor (NXF1)
pathway. Although the mRNA export complex TREX, which contains Aly/REF, UAP56,
and the THO complex, is involved in the NXF1-mediated nuclear export of cellular 
mRNAs, its contribution to the export of MLV mRNA transcripts remains poorly
understood. Here, we studied the involvement of TREX components in the export of 
MLV transcripts. Depletion of UAP56, but not Aly/REF, reduced the level of both
unspliced and spliced viral transcripts in the cytoplasm. Interestingly,
depletion of THO components, including THOC5 and THOC7, affected only unspliced
viral transcripts in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the RNA immunoprecipitation assay
showed that only the unspliced viral transcript interacted with THOC5. These
results imply that MLV requires UAP56, THOC5 and THOC7, in addition to NXF1, for 
nuclear export of viral transcripts. Given that naturally intronless mRNAs, but
not bulk mRNAs, require THOC5 for nuclear export, it is plausible that THOC5
plays a key role in the export of unspliced MLV transcripts.
