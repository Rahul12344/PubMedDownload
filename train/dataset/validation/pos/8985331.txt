Several cellular polypeptides critical for growth regulation interact with DNA
tumor virus oncoproteins. p400 is a cellular protein which binds to the
adenovirus E1A oncoprotein(s). The biological function of p400 is not yet known, 
but it is structurally and immunologically closely related to p300 and
CREB-binding protein, two known E1A-binding transcription adapters. Like p300,
p400 is a phosphoprotein that binds to the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen
(T). In anti-T coimmunoprecipitation experiments, staggered deletions spanning
the amino-terminal 250 amino acids of T did not abrogate T binding to either p400
or p300. A T species composed of residues 251 to 708 bound both p400 and p300,
while a T species defective in p53 binding was unable to bind either detectably. 
Anti-p53 immunoprecipitates prepared from cells containing wild-type T also
contained p400 and p300. Hence, both p400 and p300 can bind (directly or
indirectly) to a carboxyl-terminal fragment of T which contains its p53 binding
domain. Since the p53 binding domain of T contributes to its immortalizing and
transforming activities, T-p400 and/or T-p300 interactions may participate in
these functions.
