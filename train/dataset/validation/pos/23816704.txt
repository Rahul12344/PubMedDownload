BACKGROUND & AIMS: α-taxilin was identified as binding partner of syntaxins and
is supposed to regulate vesicular trafficking. However, the physiological
functions of α-taxilin and its potential relevance for the life cycle of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) are still poorly understood.
METHODS: Transfected hepatoma cells, infected primary human hepatocytes, and
liver tissue of HBV-infected patients were used to study the expression of
α-taxilin. Subcellular localization and colocalization were analyzed by confocal 
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Protein-protein interactions were further
investigated by co-immunoprecipitations. Silencing of α-taxilin expression was
performed by lentiviral gene transfer.
RESULTS: HBV producing cells show a significant higher level of α-taxilin. HBV
induces α-taxilin expression, by its regulatory proteins HBx and LHBs via c-Raf. 
This indicates that α-taxilin is essential for the release of HBV particles. CLSM
and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that the PreS1PreS2 domain of LHBs
interacts with α-taxilin. α-taxilin harbors a YXXL motif that represents a
classic late domain. In accordance with this, it was found by
co-immunoprecipitations that α-taxilin interacts with the ESCRT I component
tsg101. CLSM revealed that a fraction of α-taxilin colocalizes with LHBs and
tsg101.
CONCLUSIONS: α-taxilin plays an essential role for release of HBV-DNA containing 
particles. It might act as an adapter that binds, on the one hand, to LHBs and,
on the other hand, to tsg101 and thereby helps recruit the ESCRT machinery to the
viral envelope proteins.
