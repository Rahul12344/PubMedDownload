The zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) was originally identified as a host
factor that inhibits the replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Here we
report that ZAP inhibits HIV-1 infection by promoting the degradation of specific
viral mRNAs. Overexpression of ZAP rendered cells resistant to HIV-1 infection in
a ZAP expression level-dependent manner, whereas depletion of endogenous ZAP
enhanced HIV-1 infection. Both human and rat ZAP inhibited the propagation of
replication-competent HIV-1. ZAP specifically targeted the multiply spliced but
not unspliced or singly spliced HIV-1 mRNAs for degradation. We provide evidence 
indicating that ZAP selectively recruits cellular poly(A)-specific ribonuclease
(PARN) to shorten the poly(A) tail of target viral mRNA and recruits the RNA
exosome to degrade the RNA body from the 3' end. In addition, ZAP recruits
cellular decapping complex through its cofactor RNA helicase p72 to initiate
degradation of the target viral mRNA from the 5' end. Depletion of each of these 
mRNA degradation enzymes reduced ZAP's activity. Our results indicate that ZAP
inhibits HIV-1 by recruiting both the 5' and 3' mRNA degradation machinery to
specifically promote the degradation of multiply spliced HIV-1 mRNAs.
