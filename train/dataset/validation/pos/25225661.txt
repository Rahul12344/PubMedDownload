Human MCP-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1, also known as ZC3H12A and Regnase-1) plays
important roles in negatively regulating the cellular inflammatory response.
Recently, we found that as an RNase, MCPIP1 has broad-spectrum antiviral effects 
by targeting viral RNA. In this study, we demonstrated that MCPIP1 expression was
induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells. MCPIP1
expression was higher in liver tissue from patients with chronic HCV infection
compared with those without chronic HCV infection. Knockdown of MCPIP1 increased 
HCV replication and HCV-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as
TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1. However, overexpression of MCPIP1 significantly inhibited
HCV replication and HCV-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Various
mutants of functional domains of MCPIP1 showed disruption of the RNA binding and 
oligomerization abilities, as well as RNase activity, but not deubiquitinase
activity, which impaired the inhibitory activity against HCV replication. On
immunocytochemistry, MCPIP1 colocalized with HCV RNA. Use of a
replication-defective HCV John Cunningham 1/AAG mutant and in vitro RNA cleavage 
assay demonstrated that MCPIP1 could directly degrade HCV RNA. MCPIP1 may
suppress HCV replication and HCV-mediated proinflammatory responses with
infection, which might contribute to the regulation of host defense against the
infection and virus-induced inflammation.
