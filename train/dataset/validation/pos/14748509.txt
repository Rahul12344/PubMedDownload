NFAT factors control HIV-1 transcription. We show here that, in addition to
binding to two NF-kappaB/NFAT sites within the U3 HIV LTR, NFATc1 and NFATc2 bind
to an NFAT site within the LTR's U5 region. Mutations in this site which abolish 
NFAT binding reduce the ability of NFATs to transactivate LTR-mediated
transcription. Mutations in all three NFAT sites strongly interfered with LTR
induction, but affected moderately the stimulatory effect of Tat.
