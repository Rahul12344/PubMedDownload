At least two different types of proteins, NF-kappa B/KBF1 and
HIV-EP1/PRDII-BF1/MBP-1, which are members of a family of rel oncoproteins and
metal-finger proteins, respectively, bind to the human immunodeficiency virus
type (HIV-1) enhancer. As a new member of a HIV-EP1 family that is expressed at a
high level in T cells, we have isolated cDNA clones of HIV-EP2 by
cross-hybridization with HIV-EP1 cDNA. HIV-EP2 protein consists of 1,833 amino
acids and has a molecular weight of 211,000. HIV-EP2 protein is highly homologous
with HIV-EP1/PRDII-BF1/MBP-1 in three regions. These three regions contain the
potential nuclear localization signal followed by a Ser/Thr-rich region, the
DNA-binding domain consisting of a metal-finger structure, and a cluster of
acidic amino acids. The DNA-binding property of HIV-EP2 was similar to that of
HIV-EP1. Northern blot analysis of HIV-EP2 mRNA indicated relatively high
expression in the T cell line Molt-4 and in some tumor cell lines. Furthermore,
like HIV-EP1, expression of HIV-EP2 mRNA was greatly induced by mitogen and
phorbol ester treatment of Jurkat T cells, suggesting that HIV-EP2 acts in HIV
production from latently infected T cells.
