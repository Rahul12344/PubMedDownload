The adenovirus E4orf6 is a viral oncoprotein known to cooperate with the E1A gene
product in transforming primary murine cells. It has been shown to inhibit the
apoptotic activities of p53 and p73 through direct binding to these proteins.
Here, we demonstrate that the adenovirus E4orf6 protein inhibits apoptosis
mediated by BNIP3 and Bik, which are BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family. This 
activity was not mediated by p53 and p73 because E4orf6 had the same effect on
the apoptosis in Saos-2 cells that do not express p53-related genes. It was also 
ascertained that E4orf6 could change the mitochondrial localization of BNIP3 and 
Bik. A mutant lacking the nuclear export signal of E4orf6 failed to inhibit
apoptosis and to translocate BNIP3 protein from the mitochondria. Moreover, it
was also established that E4orf6 was able to interact with BNIP3 and Bik. In
BNIP3 protein, the region required for the interaction included the transmembrane
domain, which is required for the localization of BNIP3 to the mitochondria.
These results suggest that E4orf6 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, 
enabling it to interact with BH3-only proteins, eventually leading to the
inhibition of apoptotic activity.
