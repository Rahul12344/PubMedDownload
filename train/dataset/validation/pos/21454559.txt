Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) has been recently described as the cause for most 
human Merkel cell carcinomas. MCV is similar to simian virus 40 (SV40) and
encodes a nuclear large T (LT) oncoprotein that is usually mutated to eliminate
viral replication among tumor-derived MCV. We identified the hVam6p cytoplasmic
protein involved in lysosomal processing as a novel interactor with MCV LT but
not SV40 LT. hVam6p binds through its clathrin heavy chain homology domain to a
unique region of MCV LT adjacent to the retinoblastoma binding site. MCV LT
translocates hVam6p to the nucleus, sequestering it from involvement in lysosomal
trafficking. A naturally occurring, tumor-derived mutant LT (MCV350) lacking a
nuclear localization signal binds hVam6p but fails to inhibit hVam6p-induced
lysosomal clustering. MCV has evolved a novel mechanism to target hVam6p that may
contribute to viral uncoating or egress through lysosomal processing during virus
replication.
