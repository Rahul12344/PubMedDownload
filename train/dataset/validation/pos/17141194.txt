Through protein-protein binding assays, we found that HCV core protein interacted
with 14-3-3epsilon protein. Interestingly, the expression of HCV core protein
induced apoptosis in 293T cells. The apoptosis induced by core expression is
accompanied by translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, disruption of
mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and activation of
caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, over-expression of 14-3-3epsilon inhibited 
the core-induced apoptosis and Bax translocation to mitochondria. These results
indicate that HCV core protein induces the Bax-mediated apoptosis by interacting 
with 14-3-3epsilon protein in 293T cells. As a mechanism of apoptosis induction
by HCV core, we propose that the interaction of HCV core with 14-3-3epsilon
causes the dissociation of Bax from the Bax/14-3-3epsilon complex in cytosol, and
the free Bax protein provokes activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
