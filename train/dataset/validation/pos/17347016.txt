Vpr, an accessory gene product of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),
affects both viral and cellular proliferation by mediating long terminal repeat
activation, cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase, and apoptosis. We previously found
that Vpr plays a novel role as a regulator of pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and 
in vitro. However, the cellular target of Vpr, as well as the mechanism of
cellular pre-mRNA splicing inhibition by Vpr, is unknown. Here, we show clearly
that Vpr inhibits the splicing of cellular pre-mRNA, such as beta-globin pre-mRNA
and immunoglobulin (Ig) M pre-mRNA and that the third alpha-helical domain and
arginine-rich region are important its ability to inhibit splicing. Additionally,
using mutants with specific substitutions in two domains of Vpr, we demonstrated 
that the interaction between Vpr and SAP145, an essential splicing factor, was
indispensable for splicing inhibition. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation and in
vitro competitive binding assays indicated that Vpr associates with SAP145 and
interferes with SAP145-SAP49 complex formation. Thus, these results suggest that 
cellular expression of Vpr may block spliceosome assembly by interfering with the
function of the SAP145-SAP49 complex in host cells.
