The flavivirus NS3 protein plays an important role in the cleavage and processing
of the viral polyprotein and in the synthesis of the viral RNA. NS3 recruits NS2B
and NS5 proteins to form complexes possessing protease and replicase activities
through protease and nucleoside triphosphatase/helicase domains. We have found
that NS3 also induces apoptosis. Expression of the Langat (LGT) virus NS3 protein
resulted in a cleavage of cellular DNA and reduced the viability of cells.
Coexpression of NS3 with apoptotic inhibitors (CrmA and P35) and addition of
caspase peptide substrates (Z-VAD-FMK and Z-IETD-FMK) to NS3-transfected cells
blocked NS3-induced apoptosis. In cotransfection experiments, NS3 bound to
caspase-8 and enhanced caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. NS3 and caspase-8
colocalized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Deletion analysis demonstrated
that at least two regions of NS3 contribute to its apoptotic activities. The
protease and helicase domains are each able to bind to caspase-8, while the
protease domain alone induces apoptosis. The protease domain and tetrahelix
region of the helicase domain are required for NS3 to augment caspase-8-mediated 
apoptosis. Thus, the LGT virus NS3 protein is a multifunctional protein that
binds to caspase-8 and induces apoptosis.
