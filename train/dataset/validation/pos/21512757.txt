The UL14 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is highly conserved in
herpesvirus family. However, its exact function during the HSV-1 replication
cycle is little known. In the present study, a high throughput yeast two-hybrid
system was employed to screen the cellular factors interacting with UL14, and
five target candidates were yielded: (1) TSC22 domain family protein 3 (TSC22D3);
(2) Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 8 isoform 1(MED8); (3)
Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3); (4) Arrestin beta-2 (ARRB2); (5)
Cereblon (CRBN). Indirect immunofluorescent assay showed that both TSC22D3 and
MED8 co-localized with UL14. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that UL14 
could be immunoprecipitated by TSC22D3, suggesting that UL14 interacted with
TSC22D3 under physiological condition. In summary, this study opened up new
avenues toward delineating the function and physiological significance of UL14
during the HSV-1 replication cycle.
