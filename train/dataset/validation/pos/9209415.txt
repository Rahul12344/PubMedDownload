Friend spleen focus forming-virus (F-SFFV) induces acute erythroleukemia in
susceptible mice. Initiation of the erythroleukemia is due to binding of the
env-related glycoprotein gp55 encoded by F-SFFV to the erythropoietin receptor
(EPOR). The gp55/EPOR interaction induces prolonged and growth factor independent
proliferation in a factor-dependent cell line. In erythropoietin (EPO) signaling,
the JAK2/STAT5 pathway was shown to be activated downstream of the EPOR to
transmit the signal to the cells. To determine members of the JAK family and the 
STAT transcription factor family involved in the gp55/EPOR signaling, we examined
tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs and STATs in F-SFFV-infected erythroid or
erythroleukemic cells. JAK1 and STAT5 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated
but the DNA binding activity of STAT5 was not induced without EPO stimulation in 
erythroblastoid cells from spleens of F-SFFV-infected mice and erythroleukemia
cell lines derived from gp55-transgenic mice. These results indicate that JAK1 is
involved in the gp55/EPOR signaling but STAT5 is not playing an essential role in
the growth of those erythroid cells.
