The N-terminal transactivation domain of ATF2 is a target for the co-operative
activation of the c-jun promoter by p300 and 12S E1A.

The adenovirus E1A proteins activate the c-jun promoter through two
Jun/ATF-binding sites, jun1 and jun2. P300, a transcriptional coactivator of
several AP1 and ATF transcription factors has been postulated to play a role in
this activation. Here, we present evidence that p300 can control c-jun
transcription by acting as a cofactor for ATF2: (1) Over-expression of p300 was
found to stimulate c-jun transcription both in the presence and absence of E1A.
(2) Like E1A, p300 activates the c-jun promoter through the junl and jun2
elements and preferentially activates the N-terminal domain of ATF2. (3)
Co-immunoprecipitation assays of crude cell extracts indicate that endogenous
p300/CBP(-like) proteins and ATF2 proteins are present in a multiprotein complex 
that can bind specifically to the jun2 element. We further demonstrate that the
Stress-Activated-Protein-Kinase (SAPK) target sites of ATF2, Thr69 and Thr71 are 
not required for the formation of the p300/CBP-ATF2 multiprotein complex. These
data indicate that E1A does not inhibit all transcription activation functions of
p300, and, in fact, cooperates with p300 in the activation of the ATF2
N-terminus.
