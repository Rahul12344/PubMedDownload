The M3 protein encoded by murine gamma herpesvirus68 (gamma HV68) functions as an
immune system saboteur by the engagement of chemoattractant cytokines, thereby
altering host antiviral inflammatory responses. Here we report the crystal
structures of M3 both alone and in complex with the CC chemokine MCP-1. M3 is a
two-domain beta sandwich protein with a unique sequence and topology, forming a
tightly packed anti-parallel dimer. The stoichiometry of the MCP-1:M3 complex is 
2:2, with two monomeric chemokines embedded at distal ends of the preassociated
M3 dimer. Conformational flexibility and electrostatic complementation are both
used by M3 to achieve high-affinity and broad-spectrum chemokine engagement. M3
also employs structural mimicry to promiscuously sequester chemokines, engaging
conservative structural elements associated with both chemokine homodimerization 
and binding to G protein-coupled receptors.
