We describe the effect of pretreatment with alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) on the
susceptibility of the human neuroblastoma SKNMC cell line to infection by herpes 
virus type 1 (HSV-1). ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the 
A2M-HSV-1 interaction in vitro. Indirect immunofluorescence shows that A2M
exacerbated the cytopathic effect induced after HSV-1 infection. However,
A2M-pretreated SKNMC cells notably produced fewer HSV-1 particles than did the
untreated cells, suggesting that A2M could induce a restrictive infection.
Furthermore, high levels of HSV-1 and A2M induced the production of nitric oxide 
(NO) in SKNMC. Preliminary results suggest that A2M might induce apoptosis in
HSV-1-infected cells. These findings affirm the conclusion that A2M may interact 
directly with HSV-1 and modulate the course of the infection in SKNMC human
neuroblastoma cells.
