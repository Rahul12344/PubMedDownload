Double-stranded RNAs suppress the expression of homologous genes through an
evolutionarily conserved process called RNA interference (RNAi) or
post-transcriptional gene silencing. A bidentate nuclease called Dicer has been
implicated as the protein responsible for the production of short interfering
RNAs (siRNAs). In our experiments, Rex overexpression reduced the efficiency of
short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNAi. The interaction of Dicer with Rex
inhibited the conversion of shRNA to siRNA. These results suggest that the
interaction of Dicer with HTLV-I Rex inhibits Dicer activity and thereby reduces 
the efficiency of the conversion of shRNA to siRNA.
