The propagation of autonomous parvoviruses is strongly dependent on the
phosphorylation of the major nonstructural protein NS1 by members of the protein 
kinase C (PKC) family. Minute virus of mice (MVM) replication is accompanied by
changes in the overall phosphorylation pattern of NS1, which is newly modified at
consensus PKC sites. These changes result, at least in part, from the ability of 
MVM to modulate the PDK-1/PKC pathway, leading to activation and redistribution
of both PDK-1 and PKCeta. We show that proteins of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)
family are essential for virus propagation and spreading through their functions 
as adaptors for PKCeta. MVM infection led to redistribution of radixin and moesin
in the cell, resulting in increased colocalization of these proteins with PKCeta.
Radixin was found to control the PKCeta-driven phosphorylation of NS1 and newly
synthesized capsids in vivo. Conversely, radixin phosphorylation and activation
were driven by the NS1/CKIIalpha complex. Altogether, these data argue for ERM
proteins being both targets and modulators of parvovirus infection.
