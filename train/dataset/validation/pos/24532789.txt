Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members have been implicated as
critical transcription factors that function in immune responses, hematopoietic
differentiation, and cell growth regulation. Activation of IRF5 results in the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL6, and IL12, as well as 
type I interferons. In this study, we demonstrate that HIV-2 Vpx interacts with
IRF5, and Vpx inhibits IRF5-mediated transactivation. Expression of Vpx in THP-1 
cells reduced mRNA levels and protein production of Toll-like receptor-dependent 
IL6, IL12p40, and TNFα induced by lipopolysaccharide, R848, and ODN2216.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that Vpx expression results in
decreased promoter binding activity of IRF5. This study provides new insights
into mechanisms employed by HIV-2 to counteract innate immune defenses against
viral infection.
