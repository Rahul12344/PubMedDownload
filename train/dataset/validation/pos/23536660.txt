Phosphorylation of viral proteins plays important roles in the influenza A virus 
(IAV) life cycle. By using mass spectrometry, we identified tyrosine 132 (Y132)
as a phosphorylation site of the matrix protein (M1) of the influenza virus
A/WSN/1933(H1N1). Phosphorylation at this site is essential to the process of
virus replication by controlling the nuclear import of M1. We further
demonstrated that the phosphorylated tyrosine is crucial for the binding of M1 to
the nuclear import factor importin-α1, since any substitutions at this site
severely reduce this protein-protein interaction and damage the
importin-α1-mediated nuclear import of M1. Additionally, the tyrosine
phosphorylation which leads to the nuclear import of M1 is blocked by a Janus
kinase inhibitor. The present study reveals a pivotal role of this tyrosine
phosphorylation in the intracellular transportation of M1, which controls the
process of viral replication.
