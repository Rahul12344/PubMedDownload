We have recently identified Np9 as a novel nuclear protein produced by the human 
endogenous retrovirus K and were able to document the exclusive presence of np9
transcript in tumors and transformed cells. With the aim of studying whether Np9 
has a role in tumorigenesis, a systematic search for interacting proteins was
performed. Here, we identify the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase LNX (ligand of
Numb protein X) as an Np9-interacting partner. We furthermore show that the
interaction involves N- and C-terminal domains of both proteins and can affect
the subcellular localization of LNX. LNX has been reported to target the cell
fate determinant and Notch antagonist Numb for proteasome-dependent degradation, 
thereby causing an increase in transactivational activity of Notch. We document
that LNX-interacting Np9, like Numb, is unstable and degraded via the proteasome 
pathway and that ectopic Numb can stabilize recombinant Np9. Combined, these
findings point to the possibility that Np9 affects tumorigenesis through the
LNX/Numb/Notch pathway.
