Although the proteasome facilitates transcription from several yeast promoters,
it is unclear if its role is proteolytic or which subunits are involved. We show 
that the proteasome regulates the HIV-1 promoter in both proteolytic and
nonproteolytic modes. In the absence of transcription factor, Tat, proteasome was
associated with promoter and coding regions, and its proteolytic activity
regulated the level of basal transcription emanating from the promoter. Tat
switched the proteasome to a nonproteolytic mode by recruiting a
proteasome-associated protein, PAAF1, which favors proteasome dissociation into
19S and 20S particles. Gel filtration chromatography showed that expression of
both Tat and PAAF1 enhanced the abundance of a 19S-like complex in nuclear
extracts. 19S, but not 20S, subunits were strongly recruited to the promoter in
the presence of Tat and PAAF1 and coactivated Tat-dependent transcription. 19S
components facilitated transcriptional elongation and may be involved in
clearance of paused transcriptional elongation complexes from the promoter.
