Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7a is an accessory
protein with no known homologues. In this study, we report the interaction of a
SARS-CoV 7a and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein 
(SGT). SARS-CoV 7a and human SGT interaction was identified using a two-hybrid
system screen and confirmed with interaction screens in cell culture and cellular
co-localization studies. The SGT domain of interaction was mapped by deletion
mutant analysis and results indicated that tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (aa
125-158) was essential for interaction. We also showed that 7a interacted with
SARS-CoV structural proteins M (membrane) and E (envelope), which have been shown
to be essential for virus-like particle formation. Taken together, our results
coupled with data from studies of the interaction between SGT and HIV-1 vpu
indicated that SGT could be involved in the life-cycle, possibly assembly of
SARS-CoV.
