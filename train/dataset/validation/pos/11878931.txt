Poxviruses encode soluble cytokine receptors to interfere with host immune
functions. Cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV) strains USSR, Lister, and
Evans express soluble and cell surface tumor necrosis factor receptors (vTNFRs). 
We have characterized vTNFR activity in VV USSR and identified an open reading
frame that encodes both soluble and cell surface activity, hereafter referred to 
as VV cytokine response modifier E (VV CrmE). Expression and characterization
from recombinant VV and baculovirus showed VV CrmE to be an 18-kDa protein that
bound human, mouse, and rat TNF-alpha, but not human LT alpha. VV CrmE inhibited 
the cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of human, but not mouse or rat, TNF in
vitro. Nonetheless, in a murine intranasal model, USSR recombinants lacking CrmE 
were attenuated, demonstrating a role in vivo. Furthermore, expression of VV or
cowpox virus vTNFRs from VV strain WR (which itself does not express a vTNFR) was
shown to enhance virulence in the murine model.
