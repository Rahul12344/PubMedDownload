Nonenveloped viruses undergo conformational changes that enable them to bind to, 
disrupt, and penetrate a biological membrane leading to successful infection. We 
assessed whether cytosolic factors play any role in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) membrane penetration of the nonenveloped SV40. We find the cytosolic
SGTA-Hsc70 complex interacts with the ER transmembrane J-proteins DnaJB14 (B14)
and DnaJB12 (B12), two cellular factors previously implicated in SV40 infection. 
SGTA binds directly to SV40 and completes ER membrane penetration. During
ER-to-cytosol transport of SV40, SGTA disengages from B14 and B12. Concomitant
with this, SV40 triggers B14 and B12 to reorganize into discrete foci within the 
ER membrane. B14 must retain its ability to form foci and interact with
SGTA-Hsc70 to promote SV40 infection. Our results identify a novel role for a
cytosolic chaperone in the membrane penetration of a nonenveloped virus and raise
the possibility that the SV40-induced foci represent cytosol entry sites.
