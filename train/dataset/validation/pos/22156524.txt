Although O-mannosylated dystroglycan is a receptor for Lassa virus, a causative
agent of Lassa fever, recent findings suggest the existence of an alternative
receptor(s). Here we identified four molecules as receptors for Lassa virus: Axl 
and Tyro3, from the TAM family, and dendritic cell-specific intercellular
adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and liver and lymph node
sinusoidal endothelial calcium-dependent lectin (LSECtin), from the C-type lectin
family. These molecules enhanced the binding of Lassa virus to cells and mediated
infection independently of dystroglycan. Axl- or Tyro3-mediated infection
required intracellular signaling via the tyrosine kinase activity of Axl or
Tyro3, whereas DC-SIGN- or LSECtin-mediated infection and binding were dependent 
on a specific carbohydrate and on ions. The identification of these four
molecules as Lassa virus receptors advances our understanding of Lassa virus cell
entry.
