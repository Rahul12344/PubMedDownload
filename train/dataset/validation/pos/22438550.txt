In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) appeared as a
novel human virus with high similarity to bat coronaviruses. However, while
SARS-CoV uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for
cellular entry, no coronavirus isolated from bats appears to use ACE2. Here we
show that signatures of recurrent positive selection in the bat ACE2 gene map
almost perfectly to known SARS-CoV interaction surfaces. Our data indicate that
ACE2 utilization preceded the emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses from bats.
