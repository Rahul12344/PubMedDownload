Herpesviruses such as cytomegaloviruses encode functions that modulate the innate
response in diverse ways to counteract host sensing and delay host clearance
during infection. The murine cytomegalovirus M45 protein interacts with
receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 1 and RIP3 via a RIP homotypic interaction
motif. Cell death suppression by M45 requires RIP homotypic interaction
motif-dependent interaction with RIP1. This interaction also underlies the cell
tropism role of M45 in preventing premature death of endothelial cells during
murine cytomegalovirus infection. Thus, M45 is a viral inhibitor of RIP
activation that provides a direct cell type-dependent replication benefit to the 
virus while modulating other biological processes signaling via the RIP1 adaptor 
such as activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 as well as other mediators of
cell death.
