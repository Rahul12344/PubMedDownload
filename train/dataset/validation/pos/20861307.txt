Intercellular tight junctions define epithelial apicobasal polarity and form a
physical fence which protects underlying tissues from pathogen invasions. PALS1, 
a tight junction-associated protein, is a member of the CRUMBS3-PALS1-PATJ
polarity complex, which is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of
epithelial polarity in mammals. Here we report that the carboxy-terminal domain
of the SARS-CoV E small envelope protein (E) binds to human PALS1. Using
coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, we show that E interacts with PALS1
in mammalian cells and further demonstrate that the last four carboxy-terminal
amino acids of E form a novel PDZ-binding motif that binds to PALS1 PDZ domain.
PALS1 redistributes to the ERGIC/Golgi region, where E accumulates, in
SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Ectopic expression of E in MDCKII epithelial
cells significantly alters cyst morphogenesis and, furthermore, delays formation 
of tight junctions, affects polarity, and modifies the subcellular distribution
of PALS1, in a PDZ-binding motif-dependent manner. We speculate that hijacking of
PALS1 by SARS-CoV E plays a determinant role in the disruption of the lung
epithelium in SARS patients.
