The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) G protein-coupled receptor
(vGPCR) is a constitutively active, highly angiogenic homologue of the
interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptors that signals in part via the cytoplasmic protein
tyrosine phosphatase Shp2. We show that vGPCR contains a bona fide immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that binds and constitutively activates
Shp2.
