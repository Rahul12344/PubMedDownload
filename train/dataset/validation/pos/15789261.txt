HBx, a transcriptional transactivating protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), is
required for viral infection and has been implicated in virus-mediated liver
oncogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism for its influence on cell remains
largely unknown. It was proved that HBx need the help of host cell proteins to
exert its function by binding to them. During purifying of GSTX (fusion protein
of GST and HBx) expressed in E. coli, we found that it can bind specifically with
GrpE (HSP60) and DnaK (HSP70) of E. coli while GST cannot. Using GST pull-down,
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrum, we found that GSTX can
also bind to human mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP70, which are homologues of GrpE
and DnaK. These interactions between HBx and mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP70 are
supported by the result of co-immunoprecipitation experiment. It means that HBx
can form complex with E. coli and human HSP60 and HSP70. The implication of HBx, 
HSP60 and HSP70 complex in molecular mechanism of virus infection is discussed.
