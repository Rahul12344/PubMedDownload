Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA 2) activates transcription of specific
genes and is essential for B-lymphocyte transformation. EBNA 2 has an acidic
activation domain which interacts with general transcription factors TFIIB,
TFIIH, and TAF40. We now show that EBNA 2 is specifically bound to a novel
nuclear protein, p100, and that p100 can coactivate gene expression mediated by
the EBNA 2 acidic domain. The EBNA 2 acidic domain was used to affinity purify
p100. cDNA clones encoding the p100 open reading frame were identified on the
basis of peptide sequences of the purified protein. Antibody against p100
coimmunoprecipitated p100 and EBNA 2 from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed
lymphocyte extracts, indicating that EBNA 2 and p100 are complexed in vivo. p100 
overexpression in cells specifically augmented EBNA 2 acidic domain-mediated
activation. The coactivating effect is probably mediated by p100 interaction with
TFIIE. Bacterially expressed p100 specifically adsorbs TFIIE from nuclear
extracts, and in vitro-translated p56 or p34 TFIIE subunit can independently bind
to p100. p100 also appears to be essential for normal cell growth, since cell
viability was reduced by antisense p100 RNA and restored by sense p100 RNA
expression.
