Interferons (IFNs) are critical for protection from viral infection, but the
pathways linking virus recognition to IFN induction remain poorly understood.
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce vast amounts of IFN-alpha in response to the
wild-type influenza virus. Here, we show that this requires endosomal recognition
of influenza genomic RNA and signaling by means of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)
and MyD88. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules of nonviral origin also induce
TLR7-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines. These results identify ssRNA
as a ligand for TLR7 and suggest that cells of the innate immune system sense
endosomal ssRNA to detect infection by RNA viruses.
