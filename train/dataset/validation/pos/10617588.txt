Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) establishes a life-long latent infection in
sensory neurons of infected individuals. Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is
important for productive infection and reactivation from latency. Thus,
activation of ICP0 expression in neurons is likely to be important for
reactivation from latency. In a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, ICP0 promoter
activity is high compared with other strong viral promoters. In contrast,
promoter activity is low in non-neuronal cells. DNase I footprinting assays
indicated that three distinct motifs in the ICP0 promoter are bound by nuclear
factors. One of these motifs contains a binding site for a novel helix-loop-helix
olfactory neuron-specific transcription factor (Olf-1). Gel shift assays and
supershift assays using an Olf-1-specific antibody demonstrated that mouse
neuroblastoma cells express Olf-1, which is bound to the Olf-1-like site in the
ICP0 promoter. Deletion of the putative Olf-1 motif reduced ICP0 promoter
activity more than 5-fold in mouse neuroblastoma cells and prevented
trans-activation by an Olf-1 expression vector. We hypothesize that the
Olf-1-binding site activates ICP0 promoter activity in neurons during
reactivation from latency.
