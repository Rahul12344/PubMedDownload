The Epstein-Barr virus latency-associated membrane protein LMP2A has been shown
to activate the survival kinase Akt in epithelial and B cells in a
phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent fashion. In this study, we demonstrate that
the signalling scaffold Shb associates through SH2 and PTB domain interactions
with phosphorylated tyrosine motifs in the LMP2A N-terminal tail. Additionally,
we show that mutation of tyrosines in these motifs as well as shRNA-mediated
downregulation of Shb leads to a loss of constitutive Akt-activation in
LMP2A-expressing cells. Furthermore, utilization by Shb of the LMP2A ITAM motif
regulates stability of the Syk tyrosine kinase in LMP2A-expressing cells. Our
data set the precedent for viral utilization of the Shb signalling scaffold and
implicate Shb as a regulator of LMP2A-dependent Akt activation.
