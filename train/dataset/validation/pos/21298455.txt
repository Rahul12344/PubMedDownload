The flavivirus NS5 protein is one of the most important proteins of the
replication complex, and cellular proteins can interact with it. This study shows
for the first time that the yellow fever virus (YFV) NS5 protein is able to
interact with U1A, a protein involved in splicing and polyadenylation. We
confirmed this interaction by GST-pulldown assay and by co-immunoprecipitation in
YFV-infected cells. A region between amino acids 368 and 448 was identified as
the site of interaction of the NS5 protein with U1A. This region was conserved
among some flaviviruses of medical importance. The implications of this
interaction for flavivirus replication are discussed.
