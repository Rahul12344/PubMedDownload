Virus-host interactomes are instrumental to understand global perturbations of
cellular functions induced by infection and discover new therapies. The
construction of such interactomes is, however, technically challenging and time
consuming. Here we describe an original method for the prediction of
high-confidence interactions between viral and human proteins through a
combination of structure and high-quality interactome data. Validation was
performed for the NS1 protein of the influenza virus, which led to the
identification of new host factors that control viral replication.
