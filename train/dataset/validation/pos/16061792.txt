The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 gene encodes a multifunctional
oncoprotein that can subvert multiple cellular regulatory pathways. The
best-known cellular targets of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein are the retinoblastoma
tumor suppressor protein pRB and the related pocket proteins p107 and p130.
However, there is ample evidence that E7 has additional cellular targets that
contribute to its transforming potential. We isolated HPV-16 E7 associated
cellular protein complexes by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry 
and identified the 600-kDa retinoblastoma protein associated factor, p600, as a
cellular target of E7. Association of E7 with p600 is independent of the pocket
proteins and is mediated through the N terminal E7 domain, which is related to
conserved region 1 of the adenovirus E1A protein and importantly contributes to
cellular transformation independent of pRB binding. Depletion of p600 protein
levels by RNA interference substantially decreased anchorage-independent growth
in HPV-positive and -negative human cancer cells. Therefore, p600 is a cellular
target of E7 that regulates cellular pathways that contribute to
anchorage-independent growth and cellular transformation.
