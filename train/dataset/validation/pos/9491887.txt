The HIV-1 Tat protein regulates transcription elongation through binding to the
viral TAR RNA stem-loop structure. We have isolated a novel 87 kDa cyclin
C-related protein (cyclin T) that interacts specifically with the transactivation
domain of Tat. Cyclin T is a partner for CDK9, an RNAPII transcription elongation
factor. Remarkably, the interaction of Tat with cyclin T strongly enhances the
affinity and specificity of the Tat:TAR RNA interaction, and confers a
requirement for sequences in the loop of TAR that are not recognized by Tat
alone. Moreover, overexpression of human cyclin T rescues Tat activity in
nonpermissive rodent cells. We propose that Tat directs cyclin T-CDK9 to RNAPII
through cooperative binding to TAR RNA.
