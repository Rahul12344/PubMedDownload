Mammalian viruses often use components of the host's cellular DNA replication
machinery to carry out replication of their genomes, which enables these viruses 
to be used as tools for characterizing factors that are involved in cellular DNA 
replication. The human papillomavirus (HPV) E1 protein is essential for
replication of the virus DNA. Here we identify the cellular factor that
participates in viral DNA replication by using a two-hybrid assay in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E1 protein as bait. Using this assay, we isolated
Inil/hSNF5, a component of the SWI/SNF complex which facilitates transcription by
altering the structure of chromatin. In vitro binding and immunoprecipitation
confirmed that E1 interacts directly with Ini1/hSNF5. Transient DNA-replication
assay revealed that HPV DNA replication is stimulated in a dose-dependent manner 
by addition of Ini1/hSNF5, and that Ini1/hSNF5 antisense RNA blocks the
replication of HPV DNA. Amino-acid substitution at residues that are conserved
among E1 proteins prevented the E1-Ini1/hSNF5 interaction and reduced DNA
replication of HPV in vivo. Our results indicate that Ini1/hSNF5 is required for 
the efficient replication of papillomavirus DNA and is therefore needed, either
alone or in complex with SWI/SNF complex, for mammalian DNA replication as well.
