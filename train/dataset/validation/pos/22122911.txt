Sequence similarity between the erythrocyte binding domain of the Plasmodium
vivax Duffy binding protein and the V3 loop of HIV-1 strain MN reveals a
functional heparin binding motif involved in binding to the Duffy antigen
receptor for chemokines.

BACKGROUND: The HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 (SU, gp120) and the Plasmodium
vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) bind to chemokine receptors during infection 
and have a site of amino acid sequence similarity in their binding domains that
often includes a heparin binding motif (HBM). Infection by either pathogen has
been found to be inhibited by polyanions.
RESULTS: Specific polyanions that inhibit HIV infection and bind to the V3 loop
of X4 strains also inhibited DBP-mediated infection of erythrocytes and DBP
binding to the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC). A peptide including 
the HBM of PvDBP had similar affinity for heparin as RANTES and V3 loop peptides,
and could be specifically inhibited from heparin binding by the same polyanions
that inhibit DBP binding to DARC. However, some V3 peptides can competitively
inhibit RANTES binding to heparin, but not the PvDBP HBM peptide. Three other
members of the DBP family have an HBM sequence that is necessary for erythrocyte 
binding, however only the protein which binds to DARC, the P. knowlesi alpha
protein, is inhibited by heparin from binding to erythrocytes. Heparitinase
digestion does not affect the binding of DBP to erythrocytes.
CONCLUSION: The HBMs of DBPs that bind to DARC have similar heparin binding
affinities as some V3 loop peptides and chemokines, are responsible for specific 
sulfated polysaccharide inhibition of parasite binding and invasion of red blood 
cells, and are more likely to bind to negative charges on the receptor than cell 
surface glycosaminoglycans.
