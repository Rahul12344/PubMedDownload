Hendra virus (HeV) is an emerging pathogen of concern in Australia given its
ability to spillover from its reservoir host, pteropid bats, to horses and
further on to humans, and the severe clinical presentation typical in these
latter incidental hosts. Specific human pressures over recent decades, such as
expanding human populations, urbanization, and forest fragmentation, may have
altered the ecological niche of Pteropus species acting as natural HeV reservoirs
and may modulate spillover risk. This study explored the influence of
inter-decadal net human local migration between 1970 and 2000 on changes in the
habitat suitability to P. alecto and P. conspicillatus from 1980 to 2015 in
eastern Australia. These ecological niches were modeled using boosted regression 
trees and subsequently fitted, along with additional landscape factors, to HeV
spillovers to explore the spatial dependency of this zoonosis. The spatial model 
showed that the ecological niche of these two flying fox species, the human
footprint, and proximity to woody savanna were each strongly associated with HeV 
spillover and together explained most of the spatial dependency exhibited by this
zoonosis. These findings reinforce the potential for anthropogenic pressures to
shape the landscape epidemiology of HeV spillover.
