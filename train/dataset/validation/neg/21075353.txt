Autophagy influences numerous cellular processes, including innate and adaptive
immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, some viruses, including dengue
virus (DENV), usurp autophagy to enhance their replication. The mechanism for a
positive role of autophagy in DENV infection is unclear. We present data that
DENV induction of autophagy regulates cellular lipid metabolism. DENV infection
leads to an autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to
release free fatty acids. This results in an increase in cellular β-oxidation,
which generates ATP. These processes are required for efficient DENV replication.
Importantly, exogenous fatty acids can supplant the requirement of autophagy in
DENV replication. These results define a role for autophagy in DENV infection and
provide a mechanism by which viruses can alter cellular lipid metabolism to
promote their replication.
