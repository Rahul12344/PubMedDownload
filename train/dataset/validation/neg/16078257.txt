There is an increased incidence of anal squamous carcinoma and its precursor
lesions (anal intraepithelial neoplasia [AIN]) among persons who engage in
anal-receptive sex. Analogous to cervical cancer screening, anal Papanicplaou
(Pap) smears currently are used to screen these high-risk populations. Human
papilloma virus (HPV) has been implicated in anal carcinoma pathogenesis and this
study was performed to assess the potential role of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct
to anal cytology. We correlated cytological diagnoses and HPV DNA (Digene Hybrid 
Capture [HC II] assay) in anal specimens collected in SurePath liquid medium from
118 patients; 54.8% of cases diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined
significance (ASC-US) and 87.8% diagnosed as low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion (LSIL) or above tested positive for high- risk HPV DNA (B+). High-grade
SIL (HSIL) was present in 31 of the 51 patients with follow-up. Although a
cytological diagnosis of ASC-US or above was a reliable indicator for AIN,
cytology frequently did not accurately predict the grade of SIL in subsequent
biopsy. Our findings suggest that reflex HPV DNA testing would be helpful in
triaging patients diagnosed with ASC-US. However, patients diagnosed with LSIL or
above should go directly to ansocopic biopsy.
