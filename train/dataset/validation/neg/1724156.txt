alpha 2-Macroglobulin is cleaved by human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease. The 
cleavage site is the Phe684-Tyr685 bond in the "bait region", an exposed part of 
alpha 2-macroglobulin, creating the "F-form". The methylamine derivative of alpha
2-macroglobulin is also cleaved at the same bond. The homologous chicken
ovomacroglobulin does not form an F-form structure with the protease, although,
F-form generation by other enzymes is known. This is possibly due to the lack of 
a suitable cleavage sequence in the corresponding region of ovomacroglobulin. In 
human alpha 2-macroglobulin, the interdomain segment between the main part of the
molecule and the receptor-binding C-terminal domain is not cleaved by the HIV
protease although typical cleavage sequences occur. In AIDS, therefore, HIV
protease from infected cells in unlikely to interfere with receptor-binding of
alpha 2-macroglobulin.
