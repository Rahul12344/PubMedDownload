Langerhans cells are CD4+ antigen-presenting cells in the dendritic cell family
that can initiate primary and secondary immune responses after emigration from
skin and mucosa. Because of these properties, Langerhans cells have been proposed
as potential targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and as
potential vectors for the transmission of primary HIV infection to T cells after 
mucosal exposure. In support of this theory, previous investigative studies have 
demonstrated that Langerhans cells are targets for HIV infection both in vivo and
in vitro and that HIV-pulsed Langerhans cells, as well as blood dendritic cells, 
induce a productive infection in co-cultured T cells in vitro. In addition,
Langerhans cell dysfunction has been proposed as contributing to the pathogenesis
of some of the cutaneous manifestations observed in HIV+ individuals. In a recent
study, we detected Langerhans cell dysfunction in patients with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, but not in earlier stages of HIV disease. Here we review
previous and current investigative studies on HIV and the skin, with an emphasis 
on Langerhans cells, and discuss possible future investigations in this field.
