Antibodies from the yolk of eggs of chicken immunized with enteric viruses
(simian rotavirus SA 11, poliomyelitis virus type 2, and Coxsackie B2) were
obtained. The time course of the emergence and amplification of antibody in the
yolk was followed for several months by neutralization tests and enzyme
immunoassay. The long-term persistence of a high antibody level in the yolk, the 
simplicity of generation of large amounts of chromatographically pure
preparations, as well as specificity of chicken immunoglobulins open ways for
their employment in different test systems for the detection and identification
of enteric viruses.
