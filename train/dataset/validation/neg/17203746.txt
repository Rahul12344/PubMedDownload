Conglutinin, collectin-43 (CL-43) and collectin-46 (CL-46) are serum proteins
characteristic for Bovidae. They belong to collectins--family of oligomeric
proteins composed of trimeric subunits containing collagen-like sequences joined 
to C-type lectin domains. The genes encoding conglutinin, CL-43 and CL-46 are
located on the bovine chromosome 28, and phylogenetic analysis indicates their
common origin--from the lung surfactant protein D gene. Northern blot or
immunocytochemical analysis confirm biosynthesis of bovine collectins mainly in
the liver (conglutinin, CL-43) and in the thymus (CL-46). The level of
conglutinin in the serum of dairy cows depends on many factors such as breeding, 
the season of the year, the stage of the reproductive cycle and infection. The
collectins are involved in the innate immune defense. They bind to microbial
surface carbohydrates inducing aggregation and, thereby, impeding infectivity. On
the other hand the destruction of pathogens occurs due to stimulation of effector
cells. CL-43 as well as conglutinin, binds to the collectin receptor (C1qR)
localized on many types of cells identified as a surface variant of calreticulin.
Conglutinin and CL-43 show antiviral activities towards influenza A virus and
rotaviruses. Conglutinin also displays protective activity against bacterial
infections.
