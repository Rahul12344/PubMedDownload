BACKGROUND AIMS: Haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
with add-back of donor lymphocytes expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine 
kinase suicide gene (TK cells) is one of the most widely applied promising new
gene therapy approaches. However, the immunological status of added-back TK cells
after HSCT has yet to be well characterized.
METHODS: We investigated TK cells through the use of flow cytometry, T-cell
receptor (TCR) Vβ repertoire spectratyping and linear amplification-mediated
polymerase chain reaction followed by insertion site analysis in a patient
enrolled in our clinical trial.
RESULTS: A comparison of onset with remission of acute graft-versus-host disease 
confirmed that TK cells were predominantly eliminated and that proliferative
CD8(+) non-TK cells were also depleted in response to ganciclovir administration.
The TCR Vβ-chain repertoire of both TK cells and non-TK cells markedly changed
after administration of ganciclovir, and, whereas the TCR repertoire of non-TK
cells returned to a normal spectratype long after transplantation, that of TK
cells remained skewed. With the long-term prophylactic administration of
acyclovir, TK cells oligoclonally expanded and the frequency of spliced variants 
of TK cells increased. Known cancer-associated genes were not evident near the
oligoclonally expanded herpes simplex virus (HSV)-TK insertion sites.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate obvious differences in immunological status between
TK cells and non-TK cells. In addition, we speculate that long-term prophylactic 
administration of acyclovir increases the risk of oligoclonal expansion of
spliced forms of TK cells.
