PURPOSE: MRI cell tracking can be used to monitor immune cells involved in the
immunotherapy response, providing insight into the mechanism of action, temporal 
progression of tumor growth, and individual potency of therapies. To evaluate
whether MRI could be used to track immune cell populations in response to
immunotherapy, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, and 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide
particles.
METHODS: Superparamagnetic iron oxide-labeled cells were injected into mice (one 
cell type/mouse) implanted with a human papillomavirus-based cervical cancer
model. Half of these mice were also vaccinated with DepoVaxTM (ImmunoVaccine,
Inc., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada), a lipid-based vaccine platform that was
developed to enhance the potency of peptide-based vaccines.
RESULTS: MRI visualization of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, regulatory T cells, and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells was apparent 24 h post-injection, with
hypointensities due to iron-labeled cells clearing approximately 72 h
post-injection. Vaccination resulted in increased recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T
cells, and decreased recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and
regulatory T cells to the tumor. We also found that myeloid-derived suppressor
cell and regulatory T cell recruitment were positively correlated with final
tumor volume.
CONCLUSION: This type of analysis can be used to noninvasively study changes in
immune cell recruitment in individual mice over time, potentially allowing
improved application and combination of immunotherapies. Magn Reson Med
