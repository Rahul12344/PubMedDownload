Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease with dramatically increasing
morbidity rate worldwide in decades. Since there is no specific treatment to
date, early diagnosis is important for providing proper timely medical care to
minimize mortality, and for the prompt initiation of public health control
measures. NS5 is a potential biomarker for dengue virus infection due to its
highly conserved and immunogenic properties. In this study, the DENV 2 NS5
full-length and the DENV 2 NS5 C-terminus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain
fragment (NS5-C70) expression plasmids were constructed, and the 104 kDa
full-length NS5 and the 70 kDa NS5-C70 were respectively expressed in Escherichia
coli. These two purified recombinant products were found to react with the sera
of patients infected with dengue virus when analyzed by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which resulted in significantly higher absorption
values than those of control sera. The recombinant DENV 2 NS5 exhibited strong
reactivity to each of the four types of sera, whereas the NS5-C70 showed strong
reactivity only to DENV 2 and 4. In comparison, the positive agreement value of
recombinant NS5-based assay with either MyBioSource or Panbio assay was higher
than that of the two commercially available IgG indirect ELISA kits. These
results suggest that the recombinant DENV 2 NS5 be an effective antigen for
detection of dengue virus infection. The recombinant NS5-C70 may also be used as 
an auxiliary antigen for diagnostic purposes.
