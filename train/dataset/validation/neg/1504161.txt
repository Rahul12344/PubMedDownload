A significant proportion (10%) of notified AIDS cases in Portugal are due to
HIV-2 infection as a result of the close connections of Portugal with Western
African Countries (ex-Portuguese colonies) where there is a high HIV-2
seroprevalence. We conducted a seroepidemiological study of HIV-1 and HIV-2
infection in 1400 women attending family planning and antenatal clinics in a
health centre in Lisbon with the objective of analysing whether there was
evidence of HIV-2 spread in this population. The seroprevalence for HIV, as
determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot, was 0.42% (6 cases) and 50% of
these were of HIV-2 infection. Analysis of the epidemiological inquiries reveals 
that out of the 6 seropositive cases, only one was a drug addict (HIV-1) and
another a western African black woman (HIV-2). The other 4 cases (2 HIV-2 and 2
HIV-1) were white Portuguese women with no history of travelling to Africa or
previous blood transfusions, and the only risk factor was a history of multiple
sexual partners (in 3 out of 4).
