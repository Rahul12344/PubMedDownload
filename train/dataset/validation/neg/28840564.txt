Human endogenous retrovirus W family (HERV-W) envelope (env) has been reported to
be related to several human diseases, including autoimmune disorders, and it
could activate innate immunity. However, there are no reports investigating
whether human leukemia antigen (HLA)-A*0201+ restriction is involved in the
immune response caused by HERV-W env in neuropsychiatric diseases. In the present
study, HERV-W env-derived epitopes presented by HLA-A*0201 are described with the
potential for use in adoptive immunotherapy. Five peptides displaying
HLA-A*0201-binding motifs were predicted using SYFEPITHI and BIMAS, and
synthesized. A CCK-8 assay showed peptides W, Q and T promoted lymphocyte
proliferation. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A*0201+
donors with each of these peptides induced peptide-specific CD8+ T cells. High
numbers of IFN-Î³-secreting T cells were also detectable after several weekly
stimulations with W, Q and T. Besides lysis of HERV-W env-loaded target cells,
specific apoptosis was also observed. These data demonstrate that human T cells
can be sensitized toward HERV-W env peptides (W, Q and T) and, moreover, pose a
high killing potential toward HERV-W env-expressing U251 cells. In conclusion,
peptides W Q and T, which are HERV-W env antigenic epitopes, have both
antigenicity and immunogenicity, and can cause strong T cell immune responses.
Our data strengthen the view that HERV-W env should be considered as an
autoantigen that can induce autoimmunity in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as
multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. These data might provide an experimental
foundation for a HERV-W env peptide vaccine and new insight into the treatment of
neuropsychiatric diseases.
