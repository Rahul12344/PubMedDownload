Plasma selenium reference values from healthy donors in the metropolitan area of 
Barcelona are determined. A random sample from 156 healthy adults (control group)
is analysed by using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman
effect background correction. The relationship between several pathologies and Se
content is also evaluated. Se content from 64 samples from subjects with chronic 
renal failure and 54 from subjects suffering from several malignancies are
determined and the results are compared to the reference values. Moreover, Se
contents are determined and compared in two groups of children, healthy (19
samples) and children of mothers infected with HIV-1 (16 samples). In the control
group, Se plasma concentration ranges between 50 and 145 microg x L(-1) (82.2 +/-
17.5 microg x L(-1)). Significantly lower values are found in the two pathologies
studied (malignancy and chronic renal failure), compared to the control group.
However, no significant differences in Se content are found between the two
groups studied regarding malignancy and chronic renal failure. In children of
mothers infected with HIV-1, Se status is significantly lower than that of
healthy children.
