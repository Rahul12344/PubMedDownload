capacity compared to a previously characterized European isolate.

In this study, we report the genome sequence of five isolates of strawberry
mottle virus (family Secoviridae, order Picornavirales) from strawberry field
samples with decline symptoms collected in Eastern Canada. The Canadian isolates 
differed from the previously characterized European isolate 1134 in that they had
a longer RNA2, resulting in a 239-amino-acid extension of the C-terminal region
of the polyprotein. Sequence analysis suggests that reassortment and
recombination occurred among the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
the Canadian isolates are diverse, grouping in two separate branches along with
isolates from Europe and the Americas.
