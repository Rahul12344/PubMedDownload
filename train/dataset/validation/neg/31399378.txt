BACKGROUND: Patients who are immunocompromised because of malignancy have an
increased risk of herpes zoster and herpes zoster-related complications. We aimed
to investigate the efficacy and safety of an inactivated varicella zoster virus
(VZV) vaccine for herpes zoster prevention in patients with solid tumour or
haematological malignancies.
METHODS: This phase 3, two-arm, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre trial with an adaptive design was done in 329 centres across 40
countries. The trial included adult patients with solid tumour malignancies
receiving chemotherapy and those with haematological malignancies, either
receiving or not receiving chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to
receive four doses of VZV vaccine inactivated by γ irradiation or placebo
approximately 30 days apart. The patients, investigators, trial site staff,
clinical adjudication committee, and sponsor's clinical and laboratory personnel 
were masked to the group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was herpes
zoster incidence in patients with solid tumour malignancies receiving
chemotherapy, which was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population
(defined as all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of
inactivated VZV vaccine or placebo). The primary safety endpoint was serious
adverse events up to 28 days after the fourth dose in patients with solid tumour 
malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Safety endpoints were assessed in all
patients who received at least one dose of inactivated VZV vaccine or placebo and
had follow-up data. This trial is registered (NCT01254630 and EudraCT
2010-023156-89).
FINDINGS: Between June 27, 2011, and April 11, 2017, 5286 patients were randomly 
assigned to receive VZV vaccine inactivated by γ irradiation (n=2637) or placebo 
(n=2649). The haematological malignancy arm was terminated early because of
evidence of futility at a planned interim analysis; therefore, all prespecified
haematological malignancy endpoints were deemed exploratory. In patients with
solid tumour malignancies in the modified intention-to-treat population,
confirmed herpes zoster occurred in 22 of 1328 (6·7 per 1000 person-years) VZV
vaccine recipients and in 61 of 1350 (18·5 per 1000 person-years) placebo
recipients. Estimated vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster in patients with
solid tumour malignancies was 63·6% (97·5% CI 36·4 to 79·1), meeting the
prespecified success criterion. In patients with solid tumour malignancies,
serious adverse events were similar in frequency across treatment groups,
occurring in 298 (22·5%) of 1322 patients who received the vaccine and in 283
(21·0%) of 1346 patients who received placebo (risk difference 1·5%, 95% CI -1·7 
to 4·6). Vaccine-related serious adverse events were less than 1% in each
treatment group. Vaccine-related injection-site reactions were more common in the
vaccine group than in the placebo group. In the haematological malignancy group, 
VZV vaccine was well tolerated and estimated vaccine efficacy against herpes
zoster was 16·8% (95% CI -17·8 to 41·3).
INTERPRETATION: The inactivated VZV vaccine was well tolerated and efficacious
for herpes zoster prevention in patients with solid tumour malignancies receiving
chemotherapy, but was not efficacious for herpes zoster prevention in patients
with haematological malignancies.
