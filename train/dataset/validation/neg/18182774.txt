We report on a stem cell-transplanted patient with B cell chronic lymphatic
leukemia who presented with a subacute onset of focal neurological deficits, gait
abnormalities, emotional lability and dementia. Progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
brain and detection of JC virus genome in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cidofovir and 
the 5HT2A receptor antagonist chlorpromazine were subsequently administered. A
follow-up MRI of the brain 2 weeks after initiation of the antiviral therapy
displayed progress of the demyelination, and the patient died 3 months after
onset of the neurological symptoms. This report highlights the need for the
development of novel and potent strategies for treatment of progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
