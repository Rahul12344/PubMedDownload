OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship of the Herpesviridiae with
inflammation and subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients.
METHODS: Prospective study including virologically suppressed HIV-infected
patients. IgG antibodies against herpesviruses, carotid intima-media thickness
(cIMT), endothelial function through flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the
brachial artery, and blood atherosclerosis biomarkers (hsCRP, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1,
MDA, sCD14, sCD163, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, D-dimer, and PAI-1) were measured.
RESULTS: 136 patients with HIV viral load <200 copies/ml were included. 93.4%
patients were infected with herpes simplex virus type-1, 55.9% with herpes
simplex virus type-2, 97.1% with varicella-zoster virus, 65.4% with human
herpesvirus-6, 91.2% with cytomegalovirus, and 99.3% with Epstein-Barr virus.
Previous AIDS diagnosis was associated with higher cytomegalovirus IgG titers
(23,000 vs 17,000 AU, P = 0.011) and higher varicella-zoster virus IgG titers
(3.19 vs 2.88 AU, P = 0.047), and there was a positive correlation of the
Framingham risk score with IgG levels against cytomegalovirus (Spearman's Rho
0.216, P = 0.016) and Herpes simplex virus-2 (Spearman's Rho 0.293, P = 0.001).
IgG antibodies against cytomegalovirus correlated in adjusted analysis with the
cIMT (P = 0.030). High seropositivity for varicella-zoster virus (OR 2.91, 95% CI
1.05-8.01, P = 0.039), and for cytomegalovirus (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.20-11.97, P =
0.023) were predictors for the highest quartile of the cIMT in adjusted analyses.
PAI-1 levels were independently associated with cytomegalovirus IgG titers (P =
0.041), IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels with varicella-zoster virus IgG (P = 0.046 and P =
0.035 respectively), and hsCRP levels with Herpes simplex virus-2 IgG (P =
0.035).
CONCLUSION: In virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients, antibody responses
against herpesviruses are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, and with
increased inflammation and coagulation biomarkers.
