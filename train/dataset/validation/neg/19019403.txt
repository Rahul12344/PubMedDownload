Phylogenetic analysis of 19 complete VZV genomic sequences resolves wild-type
strains into 5 genotypes (E1, E2, J, M1, and M2). Complete sequences for M3 and
M4 strains are unavailable, but targeted analyses of representative strains
suggest they are stable, circulating VZV genotypes. Sequence analysis of VZV
isolates identified both shared and specific markers for every genotype and
validated a unified VZV genotyping strategy. Despite high genotype diversity no
evidence for intra-genotypic recombination was observed. Five of seven VZV
genotypes were reliably discriminated using only four single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) present in ORF22, and the E1 and E2 genotypes were resolved
using SNP located in ORF21, ORF22 or ORF50. Sequence analysis of 342 clinical
varicella and zoster specimens from 18 European countries identified the
following distribution of VZV genotypes: E1, 221 (65%); E2, 87 (25%); M1, 20
(6%); M2, 3 (1%); M4, 11 (3%). No M3 or J strains were observed.
