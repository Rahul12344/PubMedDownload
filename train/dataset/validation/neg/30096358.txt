OBJECTIVES: Between November 20, 2016 and April 17, 2017, outbreaks of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N6 occurred on poultry farms in Gyeonggi
Province in the Republic of Korea. A serosurvey was conducted among poultry
farmers to identify the transmission of HPAI A/H5N6 virus to humans.
METHODS: A descriptive study of 870 poultry farmers in Gyeonggi Province in Korea
was conducted during the 2016-2017 outbreaks. Serological testing was performed
using a microneutralization (MN) assay for antibodies against influenza
A/duck/ES2/Korea/2016 virus, which has antigenic properties similar to those of
the HPAI A/H5N6 virus that caused this poultry outbreak.
RESULTS: Overall, 523 exposed poultry farmers were assessed by serological
testing. Consequently, all tested negative for HPAI A/H5N6 virus via MN assay.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on serological assays, no transmission of HPAI A/H5N6 to
humans was identified in this study cohort. Additional studies should be
conducted to determine the possibility of poultry-to-human transmission of HPAI
A/H5N6.
