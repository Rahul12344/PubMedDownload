An E1/E2a/E3-deficient adenoviral vector encoding an epitope-tagged (flagged)
human factor VIII (FVIII) cDNA was delivered systemically to four cynomolgus
monkeys. Analysis of liver biopsy samples revealed the presence of vector DNA at 
all points in the study (day 7, 28, and 56), with vector copy number declining
approximately 10-fold between day 7 and day 56. Immunoprecipitation/Western
analyses detected human flagged FVIII in the plasma of all monkeys and expression
persisted for 14-28 days. Peak plasma FVIII levels ranged from 50 to 100 ng/ml.
Bethesda assays revealed no inhibitor in two animals, the development of a
low-level transient inhibitor in one animal, and an inhibitor titer that
continued to increase for the duration of the study in one animal. Other
treatment-related changes included modest increases in liver enzymes, an increase
in interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and a transient decrease in platelets in all four
animals. These data indicate that early generation adenoviral vectors do not
support the long-term expression of FVIII in nonhuman primates.
