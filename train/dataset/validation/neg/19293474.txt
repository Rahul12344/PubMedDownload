BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type 1 is one of the most common viruses among
human population. Studies demonstrate the essential role of cell mediated
immunity, especially CD8+ T cells, in prevention and clearance of HSV1.
OBJECTIVE: It is of great importance to improve our knowledge about the kinetics 
of CTL responses to primary and secondary HSV-1 infection.
METHODS: Using a sensitive technique for detection and analysis of CD8+ T cells, 
granzyme B ELISA, the CTL activity in the spleens of Balb/c mice at various time 
points after intraperitoneal administration of HSV1 (strain KOS) in primary and
secondary infections were determined.
RESULTS: During acute HSV-1 infection, virus specific cytotoxic T cells were
detected at day 5 post virus inoculation and peaked at day 7. Six hours after
secondary infection the activity of memory CD8+ T cells was detected and peaked
at 12 hours post infection.
CONCLUSION: The peak of CTL activity was found to be day 7 post infection in
primary HSV-1 infections which decreased with time. In secondary infections, the 
activity of CTLs reached the highest level at 12 hours post infection.
