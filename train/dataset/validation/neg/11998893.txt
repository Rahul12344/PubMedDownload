Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct clinicopathological entity,
i.e., peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy caused by human T-lymphotropic virus
type I (HTLV-1) with diverse clinical features. High frequency of genetic
instability (GIN) in both aggressive and indolent ATL was detected by comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH). Among GIN, chromosomal instability, i.e.,
ancuploidy, in indolent ATL was as frequent but less complex and dynamic as
compared to those in aggressive ATL. Some of the CGH alterations, including gain 
of 14q32, appear to be rather ATL specific. Clonal instability of HTLV-1-infected
T cells. i.e., emergence of distinct clone, was detected in about one forth of
acute crisis from indolent ATL by CGH and Southern blotting for HTLV-1. Taking
together with the previous reports of frequent subtle mutations in several tumor 
suppressor genes in aggressive ATL, GIN in multistep leukemogenesis of ATL is
diverse including clonal, chromosomal, and nucleotide levels.
