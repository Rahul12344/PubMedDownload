Increasing attention has focused on the medical risk to young, unmarried,
sexually active adults of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in
general and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in particular. Yet little
is known empirically about the extent to which this group perceives themselves to
be at risk for contracting specific STDs or is changing their behaviors to reduce
their risk. In the current study, the authors report findings from two matched
samples of unmarried young adults, 182 assessed in the winter of 1986 and 182 in 
the fall of 1987. Results demonstrated greater worry and concerns about all STDs,
including AIDS, in the second sample assessed than in the first. Some behavioral 
changes also were noted in the second group, including increased use of condoms. 
Nevertheless, 44% of sexually experienced participants in the fall of 1987
reported that they had not changed their behavior in any way to reduce their risk
of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
