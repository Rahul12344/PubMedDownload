Treatment of AIDS (HIV) and hepatitis C virus needs protease inhibitors (PI) to
prevent viral replication. Uses of PI in therapy are usually associated with a
decrease in body weight and dyslipidemia. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is 
a protein synthesized in adipocytes to increase triglycerides biosynthesis, for
that the relation of PI and ASP to adipogenesis is tested in this work. ASP
expression was increased during 3T3-L1 differentiation and reached a peak at day 
8 with cell maturation. Addition of PI during adipocytes differentiation dose
dependently and significantly (p < 0.5) inhibited the degree of triglycerides
(TG) accumulation. Moreover, presence of ASP (450 ng/mL) in media significantly
(p < 0.5) stimulated the degree of TG accumulation and there was additive
stimulation for ASP when added with insulin (10 microg/mL). Finally, when ASP in 
different doses (Low, 16.7; Medium, 45 and High, 450 ng/mL) incubated with a dose
of x150 PI, ASP partially inhibited the PI-inhibited adipogenesis and TG
accumulation. The results in this study show that PI inhibit lipids accumulation 
and confirm role of ASP in TG biosynthesis and adipogenesis.
