CD83 is the best-known surface marker for mature dendritic cells (DC) and
recently we could show that a soluble form of CD83 inhibits DC maturation. In
addition, this soluble form inhibits DC-mediated T cell proliferation in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, several viruses induce CD83 degradation or shedding in 
infected DC. A soluble form of CD83 was also found in plasma and serum of healthy
individuals and interestingly at highly elevated levels in a number of
haematological malignancies. Thus, CD83 also has functional implications for the 
immune response. However, the molecular mechanism is not well defined. Here we
describe for the first time that soluble CD83 completely changed the cytoskeleton
(analysed using phalloidin-, tubulin- and fascin-specific antibodies) when
administered at a concentration of 10 microg/ml to mature DC. The cells rounded
off and had only short, truncated, or no veils at all. Furthermore, soluble
CD83-treated cells were completely inhibited in their ability to form clusters
with T cells, an absolute prerequisite in order to stimulate T cells.
