Proprotein convertases (PCs) are crucial in the processing and entry of viral or 
bacterial protein precursors and confer increased infectivity of pathogens
bearing a PC activation site, which results in increased symptom severity and
lethality. Previously, we developed a nanomolar peptide inhibitor of PCs to
prevent PC activation of infectious agents. Herein, we describe a peptidomimetic 
approach that increases the stability of this inhibitor for use in vivo to
prevent systemic infections and cellular damage, such as that caused by influenza
H5N1 and Shiga toxin. The addition of azaβ(3)-amino acids to both termini of the 
peptide successfully prevented influenza hemagglutinin 5 fusogenicity and Shiga
toxin Vero toxicity in cell-based assays. The results from a cell-based model
using stable shRNA-induced proprotein convertase knockdown indicate that only
furin is the major proprotein convertase required for HA5 cleavage.
