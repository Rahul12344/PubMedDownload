We studied the effect of two cytokines, basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF)
and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
replication in cultured human lung fibroblasts. We show that TGF-beta increases
HCMV production, probably by a transcriptional mechanism, and that bFGF represses
HCMV replication in a dose-dependent manner. These actions were antagonistic and 
the mechanisms involved were independent of the effects of these factors on cell 
DNA synthesis and proliferation.
