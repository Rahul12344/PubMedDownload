Recombinant baculoviruses were used to express the gp160 envelope glycoprotein of
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a truncated variant
designated gp160(t) which lacks a transmembrane domain. Glycosylation,
proteolytic cleavage, secretion, and biological activities of gp160 and gp160(t) 
160(t) were studied in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Both proteins were rapidly
glycosylated and initially were found to be totally
endo-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H (endo-H) sensitive. However, partial
resistance to endo-H was gradually acquired by both molecules. gp160 was found to
remain cell-associated, whereas gp160(t) was secreted into the culture medium in 
large amounts. A fraction of gp160 and gp160(t) appeared to be proteolytically
cleaved, and a cleavage product corresponding in size to gp120 was identified in 
the culture medium. gp160(t) was found to interact specifically with CD4
receptors without any requirement for proteolytic cleavage. The gp160 protein was
shown to be expressed on the surface of S. frugiperda cells by direct
immunofluorescence. These surface molecules were biologically active, as
demonstrated by their ability to induce syncytium formation when cocultivated
with HeLa T4 cells.
