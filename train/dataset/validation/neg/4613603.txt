Radiation genetics in microorganisms and evolutionary considerations.

Kondo S.

Recent knowledge of UV-resistance mechanisms in microorganisms is reviewed in
perspective, with emphasis on E. coli. Dark-repair genes are classified into
"excision" and "tolerance" (ability to produce a normal copy of DNA from damaged 
DNA). The phenotype of DNA repair is rather common among the microorganisms
compared, and yet their molecular mechanisms are not universal. In contrast, DNA 
photoreactivation is the simplest and the most general among these three repair
systems. It is proposed that DNA repair mechanisms evolved in the order:
photoreactivation, excision repair, and tolerance repair. The UV protective
capacity and light-inducible RNA photoreactivation possessed by some plant
viruses are interpreted to be the result of solar UV selection during a rather
recent era of evolution.
