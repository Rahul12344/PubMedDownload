Efficacy of translation in the rickettsia Coxiella burnetii.

Donahue JP, Thompson HA.

The addition of coliphage Q beta ribonucleic acid to a cell-free translation
system obtained from Coxiella burnetii cells caused the formation of monosomes
and disomes from ribosomal subunits and resulted in synthesis of viral coat
protein. Rickettsial ribosomes and associated translation factors functioned
together, with fidelity, efficiency, and a specificity similar to those of
free-living gram-negative bacteria.
