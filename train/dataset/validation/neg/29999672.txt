No information is available on the clinical use of diethyltoluamide (DEET) during
breastfeeding. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency consider DEET to be safe and effective during
breastfeeding when used as directed.[1] It should be used by breastfeeding women 
to avoid exposure to mosquito-borne viruses.[1][2][3] Avoid application directly 
to the nipple and other areas where the infant might directly ingest the product.
