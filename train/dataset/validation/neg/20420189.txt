Blood cell counts, differential blood cell counts and weights of the spleen and
peripheral lymph nodes draining the area of lesions induced by Moloney sarcoma
virus inoculation into the quadriceps shank muscles of inbred BALB/c mice were
examined at various stages of tumor development and regression. The blood cell
count remained constant through the observation period up to 27 days post tumor
development and regression. Differential counts revealed some changes in the
cellular composition of the peripheral blood. The most pronounced was an increase
of neutrophiles at the stage of tumor development, and their decline with tumour 
regression. The enlargement of the spleen and of the popliteal lymph nodes
draining the tumour site, at the peak of tumor development on day 13 post MSV
inoculation, involved at least a doubling of splenic weight, and a much greater
weight increase for lymph nodes. This was a long-lasting, although declining
event, extending beyond tumor regression.
