The choroid plexus contains a major reservoir of macrophages poised for efficient
delivery of virus and neurotoxins to the brain after infection by lentiviruses
such as human or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). However, their contribution
to neurotoxicity is poorly understood. Medium from FIV-infected, choroid plexus
macrophages applied to cultured feline cortical neurons induced a small acute
calcium rise followed by either a delayed calcium deregulation (41%) or swelling 
and bursting (23%). NMDA glutamate receptor blockade prevented the acute calcium 
increase and antagonists to the IP(3) receptor, voltage-gated calcium channels
and sodium channels suppressed both the acute and late increases. Analysis of
intracellular calcium recovery in toxin-treated neurons after a brief exposure to
glutamate, revealed a decrease in the rate and extent of recovery. The apparent
diverse pharmacological contributions to intracellular calcium destabilization
may be due to the ability of macrophage toxins to interfere with recovery of
intracellular calcium homeostasis.
