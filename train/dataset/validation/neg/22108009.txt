During the 1990s, Milan Labuda's experimental results established a new paradigm 
for the study of tick-borne viruses that has since been strengthened by its
demonstrated effectiveness in explaining the epidemiology of tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE). This brief review summarizes the essential features of the
transmission of tick-borne pathogens such as TBE virus. Leukocytes migrate
between tick feeding sites, bearing infective virions and providing a transport
route for the virus between co-feeding ticks independent of a systemic viraemia. 
Such tick-borne pathogens are thus transmitted from tick to tick via vertebrates;
the ticks are the reservoirs as well as the vectors, while the vertebrate is the 
transient bridge. The aim is to bring the related but non-synonymous terms
(co-feeding and non-systemic) to the attention of workers who use simple PCR
screening to identify additional vertebrate reservoir hosts of vector-borne
pathogens that are not in fact maintained in nature through systemic
transmission.
