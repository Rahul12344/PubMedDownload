BACKGROUND: Chest wall defects continue to present a complicated treatment
scenario for thoracic and reconstructive surgeons. The purpose of this study is
to report our 25-year experience with chest wall resections and reconstructions.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 200 patients who had chest wall resections
from 1975 to 2000 was performed.
RESULTS: Patient demographics included tobacco abuse, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and human immunodeficiency virus. Surgical indications included lung
cancer, breast cancer, chest wall tumors, and severe pectus deformities.
Twenty-nine patients had radiation necrosis and 31 patients had lung or chest
wall infections. The mean number of ribs resected was 4 +/- 2 ribs. Fifty-six
patients underwent sternal resections. In addition 14 patients underwent
forequarter amputations. Immediate closure was performed in 195 patients whereas 
delayed closure was performed in 5 patients. Primary repair without the use of
reconstructive techniques was possible in 43 patients. Synthetic chest wall
reconstruction was performed using Prolene mesh, Marlex mesh, methyl methacrylate
sandwich, Vicryl mesh, and polytetrafluoroethylene. Flaps utilized for soft
tissue coverage were free flap (17 patients) and pedicled flap (96 patients).
Mean postoperative length of stay was 14 +/- 14 days. Mean intensive care unit
stay was 5 +/- 9 days. In-hospital and 30-day survival was 93%.
CONCLUSIONS: Chest wall resection with reconstruction utilizing synthetic mesh or
local muscle flaps can be performed as a safe, effective one-stage surgical
procedure for a variety of major chest wall defects.
