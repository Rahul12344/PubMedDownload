The novel capsid-binding antiviral pleconaril inhibits in vitro replication of
most rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Oral pleconaril treatment was studied in 2
parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Among 1363
picornavirus-infected participants (65%) in the studies combined, the median time
to alleviation of illness was 1 day shorter for pleconaril recipients than for
placebo recipients (P<.001). Cold symptom scores and frequency of picornavirus
cultured from nasal mucus specimens were lower among pleconaril recipients by day
2 of treatment. No treatment effects were seen in those without picornavirus
infection. Pleconaril was associated with a higher incidence of nausea (6% vs.
4%) and diarrhea (9% vs. 7%) and with small increases in mean serum cholesterol
levels and platelet counts, compared with baseline measurements. A subsequent
6-week prophylaxis study found that pleconaril induces cytochrome P-450 3A
enzymes, which metabolize a variety of drugs, including ethinyl estradiol. Early 
pleconaril treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced the duration
and severity of colds due to picornaviruses in adults.
