BACKGROUND: Human T lymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a chronic
inflammatory disease of the central nervous system known as HTLV-1-associated
myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM) which resembles chronic spinal
forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The pathogenesis of HAM remains uncertain. To
aid in the differential diagnosis of HAM and to identify pathogenetic mechanisms,
we analysed the plasma proteome in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs), patients
with HAM, uninfected controls, and patients with MS. We used surface-enhanced
laser desorption-ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry to analyse the plasma
proteome in 68 HTLV-1-infected individuals (in two non-overlapping sets, each
comprising 17 patients with HAM and 17 ACs), 16 uninfected controls, and 11
patients with secondary progressive MS. Candidate biomarkers were identified by
tandem Q-TOF mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The concentrations of three plasma proteins--high [β2-microglobulin],
high [Calgranulin B], and low [apolipoprotein A2]--were specifically associated
with HAM, independently of proviral load. The plasma [β2-microglobulin] was
positively correlated with disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that monocytes are activated by contact with
activated endothelium in HAM. Using β2-microglobulin and Calgranulin B alone we
derive a diagnostic algorithm that correctly classified the disease status
(presence or absence of HAM) in 81% of HTLV-1-infected subjects in the cohort.
