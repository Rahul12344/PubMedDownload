Complementary DNAs covering the entire RNA genome of soybean dwarf luteovirus
(SDV) were cloned and sequenced. Computer analysis of the 5861 nucleotide
sequence revealed five major open reading frames (ORFs) possessing conservation
of sequence and organisation with known luteovirus sequences. Comparative
analyses of the genome structure show that SDV shares sequence homology and
features of gene organisation with barley yellow dwarf virus (PAV isolate) in the
5' half of the genome, yet is more closely related to potato leafroll virus in
its 3' coding regions. In addition, SDV differs from other known luteoviruses in 
possessing an exceptionally long 3' terminal sequence with no apparent coding
capacity. We conclude from these data that the SDV genome represents a third
variant genome type in the luteovirus group.
