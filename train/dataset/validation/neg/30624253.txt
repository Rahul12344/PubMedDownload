Genetic variants in APOL1, encoding apolipoprotein L1, are major drivers of
glomerular disease in peoples of sub-Saharan African descent. APOL1-associated
primary glomerular diseases include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, human
immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathies, and arterionephrosclerosis.
Other conditions where APOL1 variants affect outcomes include membranous
nephropathy, lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, preeclampsia, and kidney
transplant. In focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, APOL1 variants are associated 
with upregulation of RNA encoding chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 3 ligands and
ubiquitin D; the significance of these findings remains unclear but may provide
valuable insight into disease mechanisms.
