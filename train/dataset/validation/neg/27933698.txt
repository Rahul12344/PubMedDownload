Until 2014, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin was the recommended standard of
care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in India.
This open-label phase 3b study, conducted across 14 sites in India between 31
March 2014 and 30 November 2015, evaluated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir 
plus ribavirin therapy among treatment-naïve patients with chronic genotype 1 or 
3 HCV infection. A total of 117 patients with genotype 1 or 3 HCV infection were 
randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir 400 mg and weight-based ribavirin (1000 or
1200 mg) daily for 16 or 24 weeks. Among those with genotype 1 infection, the
primary efficacy endpoint of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks
post-treatment (SVR12) was reported in 90% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 73-98)
and 96% (95% CI, 82-100) of patients following 16 and 24 weeks of treatment,
respectively. For patients with genotype 3 infection, SVR12 rates were 100% (95% 
CI, 88-100) and 93% (95% CI, 78-99) after 16 and 24 weeks of therapy,
respectively. Adverse events, most of which were mild or moderate in severity,
occurred in 69% and 57% of patients receiving 16 and 24 weeks of treatment,
respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were asthenia,
headache and cough. Only one patient in the 24-week group discontinued treatment 
with sofosbuvir during this study. Overall, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy
achieved SVR12 rates ≥90% and was well tolerated among treatment-naïve patients
with chronic genotype 1 or 3 HCV infection in India.
