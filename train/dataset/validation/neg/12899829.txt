Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires a programmed -1 ribosomal
frameshift to produce Gag-Pol, the precursor of its enzymatic activities. This
frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence on the viral messenger RNA and is
stimulated by a specific structure, downstream of the shift site. While in group 
M, the most abundant HIV-1 group, the frameshift stimulatory signal is an
extended bulged stem-loop, we show here, using a combination of mutagenesis and
probing studies, that it is a pseudoknot in group O. The mutagenesis and probing 
studies coupled to an in silico analysis show that group O pseudoknot is a
hairpin-type pseudoknot with two coaxially stacked stems of eight base-pairs
(stem 1 and stem 2), connected by single-stranded loops of 2nt (loop 1) and 20nt 
(loop 2). Mutations impairing formation of stem 1 or stem 2 of the pseudoknot
reduce frameshift efficiency, whereas compensatory changes that allow
re-formation of these stems restore the frameshift efficiency to near wild-type
level. The difference between the frameshift stimulatory signal of group O and
group M supports the hypothesis that these groups originate from a different
monkey to human transmission.
