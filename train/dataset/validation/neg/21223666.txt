OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between influenza epidemic and genetic
characteristic on the whole genome of influenza virus subtype A/H3N2 strains
isolated in Zhejiang province during 1998 to 2009.
METHODS: All of the eight genes from the 19 Zhejiang influenza virus isolates,
circulated during 1998 to 2009, were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The
obtained sequences were aligned and analyzed with the vaccine strains being used 
in the last 10 years.
RESULTS: The highest mutation happened within HA and NA genes and the amino acid 
divergent ratios were 13.98% and 10.00%. Amongst the six internal proteins, the
amino acid divergent ratios of NP, M2 and NS1 were 6.43%, 6.19% and 3.48%
respectively, and the others were lower than 3%. Other than the HA and NA genes, 
mutations were also observed on six internal genes of the strains isolated in
those years when the influenza virus subtype A/H3N2 was widely circulating.
Additionally, there had been an obvious genetic lag between vaccine strains
recommended by WHO and the contemporary Zhejiang epidemic strains for many years.
CONCLUSION: Besides on HA and NA genes, surveillance programs should also be
covered mutations regarding the internal genes of influenza virus subtype A/H3N2 
strains, in order to provide important information for forecasting and warning of
a new round of influenza epidemic.
