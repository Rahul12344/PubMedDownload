Hyperimmune anti-human immunodeficiency virus immunoglobulin (HIVIG) is an
intravenous immunoglobulin prepared from HIV-infected asymptomatic donors with a 
CD4 cell count greater than 400 cells/microl and a high titer of antibody to
HIV-1 p24 protein. Twelve persons with AIDS received four doses of HMG (two at 50
mg/kg of body weight and then two at 200 mg/kg) every 28 days. Pharmacokinetics
were evaluated by measurement of anti-p24 antibody. HIVIG was well tolerated, and
all participants completed the study. Three subjects who were not receiving
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis developed PCP. The mean value
for HIVIG clearance was 3.02 ml/kg/day at 50 mg/kg and 3.65 ml/kg/day at 200
mg/kg (P = 0.027); the mean trough antibody titers (reciprocal units) were 1,442 
and 4,428, respectively. This study indicates that high titers of anti-p24
antibody can be maintained with a monthly administration schedule of HIVIG and
that short-term safety is acceptable. Comparisons to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of HIVIG are justified.
