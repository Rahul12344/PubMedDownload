Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by deacetylating 
Forkhead box O 1 (FoxO1). HDAC9 upregulation is involved in hepatitis C virus
(HCV)-associated exaggerated gluconeogenesis. Herein, we found in addition to
FoxO1, HDAC9 also regulates other gluconeogenic transcription factors, including 
peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), cyclic
AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 
Unlike FoxO1, which is regulated by post-translational modification responses to 
HDAC9, HDAC9 regulates PGC-1α, CREB and GR by altering gene expression. Similar
to PGC-1α, CREB and GR were found to be novel regulatory targets of FoxO1 by
examination of the FoxO1 binding site in their promoter. PGC-1α, CREB and GR were
upregulated in response to HDAC9 via FoxO1 deacetylation. These findings indicate
that HDAC9-FoxO1 signalling contributes to gluconeogenesis by modulating the
expression of gluconeogenic transcription factors. In particular, metabolic
profiling demonstrated a clear shift towards gluconeogenesis metabolism, and
HDAC9-FoxO1 signalling can be strongly induced to upregulate gluconeogenic
transcription factors following HCV infection. The positive correlation between
HDAC9 and gluconeogenic transcription factor expression levels in the livers of
both HCV-infected patients and normal individuals further emphasizes the clinical
relevance of these results. Thus, HDAC9-FoxO1 signalling axis is involved in
regulating gluconeogenic transcription factors, gluconeogenesis, and HCV-induced 
type 2 diabetes.
