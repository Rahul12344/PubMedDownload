BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid testing is the major method used to monitor HIV viral
load. Commercial systems based on real-time PCR assays are available for
high-volume centralized laboratory testing, but they are not fully automated.
OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: We have compared the diagnostic performance of the
Hologic Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay (Aptima) (based on real-time TMA) on the
Panther instrument, a fully-automated random access platform, to that of, the
Roche Cobas Ampliprep Cobas TaqMan (CAP/CTM) HIV-1 version 2.0 (based on
real-time PCR).
RESULTS: Probit analysis of replicate dilutions of NIBSC WHO International HIV-1 
Standard, gave LODs of 8.6 c/ml for Aptima and 15.2 c/ml for CAP/CTM. The
agreement between the assays was excellent when measuring HIV RNA in a calibrated
reference (κ=0.90, p<0.001) and good when measuring clinical samples (κ=0.62,
p<0.001). The correlation among the samples quantified by the two methods was
very good (r=0.95, p<0.001) and the mean difference between the values obtained
with the two assays was 0.02 log c/ml for B and non-B subtypes. The vast majority
of results showed <0.5 log variance between the two assays (89%); only one sample
showed results that differed by over 1.0 log c/ml.
CONCLUSION: The performance of the new fully automated Aptima assay is adequate
for clinical monitoring of HIV-1 RNA during infections and treatment. The Aptima 
assay is well suited for routine laboratory use.
