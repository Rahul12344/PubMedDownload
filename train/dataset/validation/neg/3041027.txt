Transforming and mitogenic effects of avian leukemia virus E26 on chicken
hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts, respectively, correlate with level of
expression of the provirus.

We have investigated the effect of E26, an avian leukemia retrovirus, on the
growth properties of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). E26-infected CEFs were
not transformed, according to several transformation parameters, but exhibited an
activated growth in vitro. They started to grow without latency in
serum-supplemented medium, maintained long-term growth in regular or low-serum
medium, and could grow when seeded at low cell density in low-serum medium. We
compared the integration and the level of expression of the proviral DNA in
E26-infected CEFs and E26-transformed hematopoietic cells. An average of two
provirus copies were found in each kind of cells. However, whereas high contents 
of both viral mRNA and E26-specific protein products were found in transformed
hematopoietic cells, we detected only low amounts of viral mRNA and no E26
protein in infected CEFs. These data show that the level of expression of the E26
provirus is lower in CEFs than in hematopoietic cells. They suggest that
transformation efficiency of the virus depends on its level of expression.
