ONTOGENESIS OF HUMAN SMALLPOX VIRUS.

AVAKYAN AA, BYCKOVSKY AF.

THE VEGETATIVE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN SMALLPOX VIRUS IS DESCRIBED AS
BEING COMPRISED OF FOUR SUCCESSIVE PERIODS: "without membrane" period;
"open-cavity" period; "single-cavity" period; and "double-cavity" period. This
classification is based on the organization of the virus membranes. This paper
presents a description of the changes in virus structure during each period. It
shows the strict sequence of morphological continuity and succession of
differentiation of viral components. The most important stage of the development,
the differentiation of virus nucleoid, takes place in the virus cavity
morphologically isolated from the cellular milieu and limited originally by the
external membrane of the virus and then by the second one, the primary membrane
of the nucleoid. Osmiophilic fibrils 20 to 25 A wide, which fill the cavity of a 
mature nucleoid, become clearly evident after staining with uranyl acetate and
are revealed only at the end of the last or double-cavity period. The main
features of the developmental cycle of human smallpox virus may probably be
characteristic of certain other groups of viruses.
