Aichi virus, genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae, has been proposed as a
causative agent of gastroenteritis in human. Although high seroprevalence has
been detected, it has been identified in only a few cases. We report detection of
Aichi virus in Hungary. A total of 65 stool samples were tested retrospectively, 
collected from children with diarrhea, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction. One (1.5%) sample from a 3-year-old girl was positive. Besides
diarrhea, fever, purulent conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms were also
present at the same time with virus shedding. The genotype A virus,
Kobuvirus/human/Szigetvar-HUN298/2000/Hungary (FJ225407), has 96% nucleotide
identity to Aichi virus.
