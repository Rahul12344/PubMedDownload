Serologic diagnosis of bovine paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) with currently
available tests may give false-positive results due to cross-reactions with avian
and bovine tuberculosis viruses and other infectious agents. Indirect
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detection of antibodies against
paratuberculosis based on antigens from Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium
(A-ELISA) and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (P-ELISA) were compared. Despite
an expected higher specificity for M. a. paratuberculosis in the P-ELISA, the 2
antigens were equally suitable for demonstration of antibody to M. a.
paratuberculosis in cattle. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was
used to demonstrate the possible antigenic relationship. The area under the curve
(AUC) was calculated for each of the 2 ROC curves. The AUC for the P-ELISA ROC
curve was 0.9197, and the AUC for the A-ELISA ROC curve was 0.9149, demonstrating
a negligible difference in efficiency of the 2 tests (z = 0.182).
