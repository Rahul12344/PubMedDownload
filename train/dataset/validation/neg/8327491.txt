Transgenic tobacco plants that express the genome-linked
protein/proteinase-coding region of the potyvirus tobacco vein mottling virus
(TVMV) were produced and tested for their reaction to inoculation with TVMV and
two other potyviruses. These plants did not develop disease symptoms after being 
inoculated with large doses of TVMV but were as susceptible to infection by the
other potyviruses as were control plants. Lines of tobacco that express the coat 
protein- or the nonstructural cylindrical inclusion protein-coding regions were
also produced. The coat protein transgenic plants were protected against all
three potyviruses, and the cylindrical inclusion transgenic plants were
susceptible to all three potyviruses. These results indicate that some, but not
all, TVMV genes can be used to confer protection against potyviruses in plants.
The results also suggest that combinations of viral genes in transgenic plants
might improve protection against potyviruses.
