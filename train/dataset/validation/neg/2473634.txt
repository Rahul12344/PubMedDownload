Histamine release caused by anti-IgE was examined in leukocyte suspensions from
10 healthy individuals. Influenza A virus was found to enhance the histamine
release but did not release histamine per se. When monoclonal antibodies directed
against the viral neuraminidase were included in the samples, the potentiating
effect of the virus was completely abolished. The same occurred using a
neuraminidase inhibitor. However, monoclonal antibodies directed against the
viral haemagglutinin also abolished the potentiation. A binding of virus to the
basophil cell surface by haemagglutinin therefore seems to be necessary for the
viral neuraminidase to cause potentiation of mediator release.
