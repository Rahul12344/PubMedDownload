A total of 963 HIV-infected patients have been identified or followed up in
Martinique since 1985. Medical files were used to retrieve information about age,
sex, circumstances of diagnosis, HTLV-I status, and HIV clinical grade at first
examination according to CDC criteria from 1987. Complete information was
available for 774 patients. At the first clinical examination, the clinical grade
of 65 coinfected patients was more severe than that of the monoinfected patients 
(GIV versus GII, OR = 2.60, p < 0.01), but after adjustment for age and sex, this
odds ratio was reduced 1.57. Although this study cannot invalidate the hypothesis
of a faster progression toward AIDS of coinfected than of monoinfected patients, 
it shows that one or several other mechanisms contribute to the different grades 
of severity at the first clinical examination observed between these two
categories of patients. We believe that HTLV-I infection acquired during
adulthood is a marker of high-risk behavior and that it might be associated with 
early or multiple HIV infections.
