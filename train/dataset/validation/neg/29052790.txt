BACKGROUND: Once-daily, orally administered, co-formulated glecaprevir (NS3/4A
protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (NS5A inhibitor) (G/P) demonstrated
pangenotypic activity and high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in
studies outside Japan. Here we report safety and efficacy in a subset of Japanese
patients with chronic HCV infection who received G/P 300/120 mg in a phase 3,
open-label, multicenter study (CERTAIN-1).
METHODS: This analysis focuses on three difficult-to-treat subgroups: HCV
GT1/2-infected patients who failed to achieve SVR after treatment with a direct
acting antiviral (DAA)-containing regimen; GT1/2-infected patients with severe
renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2); and 
GT3-infected patients. Patients in the renal impairment and GT3 cohorts were
treatment-naive or interferon treatment-experienced. Noncirrhotic GT1/2-infected,
DAA-naïve patients in the renal impairment cohort received G/P for 8 weeks; all
other patients were treated for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was SVR (HCV
RNA < 15 IU/mL) 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12).
RESULTS: The study enrolled 33 GT1/2-infected patients who failed previous DAA
treatment (four with cirrhosis); 12 GT1/2-infected patients with severe renal
impairment (two with cirrhosis); and 12 GT3-infected patients (two with
cirrhosis). SVR12 was achieved by 31/33 (93.9%), 12/12 (100%), and 10/12 (83.3%) 
patients, respectively. One serious adverse event (fluid overload, not related to
G/P) occurred in a patient on chronic intermittent hemodialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: G/P achieved high SVR12 rates and was well tolerated in three
difficult-to-treat patient subgroups with limited treatment options in Japan
(DAA-experienced patients, patients with severe renal impairment, and
GT3-infected patients). These results support the potential suitability of this
regimen for these special populations in Japan.
