IgGs were purified from the sera of HTLV-I transgenic and nontransgenic mice.
Comparative studies of the N-linked sugar chains released by hydrazinolysis
revealed that their structures of transgenic IgG are quite different from those
of nontransgenic IgG. Although both IgGs contained biantennary complex-type
oligosaccharides, transgenic IgG had more agalactosylated forms (45%) than those 
from nontransgenic IgG (28%), just as was found in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). Since these transgenic mice express arthritis similar to RA, it
will be a useful model to investigate the relationship between the
galactosylation of IgG and the development of RA.
