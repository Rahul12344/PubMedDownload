In the present work the Authors report the results of the research of HAAb in 383
subjects living in Rome with negative history for hepatitis (divided for age, sex
and occupation) and in 64 acute non B hepatitis (HBsAg-). In the latter, the
titer of HAAb was determined at the beginning and later during the course of the 
disease. A fractionation of 13 sera of these patients was done and the type of
specific immunoglobulin was determined. Among the subject with negative history
for hepatitis, 68.9% was positive during first 6 months of age 6.2% from 6 months
to 5 y.o., 27.6% from 6 to 12 y.o., 45.4% from 12 to 17 y.o., 76.8% from 18 to 25
y.o., 82.2% from 26 to 45 y.o., 90.2% from 46 to 65 y.o.. There was no
statistically significant difference either between males and females, or among
various occupations. Among the 64 patients with non B hepatitis, 25 (39%) were
hepatitis A (because they showed either a seroconversion for HAAb or a positive
HAAb-IgM); 12 (18.7%) were non A-non B hepatitis because HAAb negative or HAAb
positive but negative for HAAb-IgM; while 27 (42.2%) were impossible to classify 
because they showed a positivity for HAAb but not a seroconversion during the
disease. The limit of the determination of HAAb and the utility of the research
of IgM antibody for the diagnosis of hepatitis A are discussed.
