Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a small dipeptide with numerous activities,
including antioxidant effects, metal ion chelation, proton buffering capacity,
and inhibitory effects on protein carbonylation and glycation. Carnosine has been
mostly studied in organs where it is abundant, including skeletal muscle,
cerebral cortex, kidney, spleen, and plasma. Recently, the effect of
supplementation with carnosine has been studied in organs with low levels of
carnosine, such as the lung, in animal models of influenza virus or
lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. Among the
known protective effects of carnosine, its antioxidant effect has attracted
increasing attention for potential use in treating lung disease. In this review, 
we describe the in vitro and in vivo biological and physiological actions of
carnosine. We also report our recent study and discuss the roles of carnosine or 
its related compounds in organs where carnosine is present in only small amounts 
(especially the lung) and its protective mechanisms.
