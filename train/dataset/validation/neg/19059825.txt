The trigeminal trophic syndrome is a rare complication following central or
peripheral injury of the trigeminal nerve typically characterized by unilateral
distribution of anaesthesia, paraesthesia and ulceration. In one third of cases
it is preceded by an iatrogenic damage of the trigeminal nerve, in another third 
by a history of stroke. Other causes include head trauma, intracranial tumours,
herpes virus infection, degenerative diseases of the CNS and idiopathic. Little
is known about the pathogenesis. Contribution of neurotrophic factors and an
altered sympathetic activity is assumed but a pivotal role of self-mutilation is 
generally accepted. We report a case of a patient who developed a strictly
unilateral crescent ulcer of the ala nasi in addition to an extensive ulceration 
of the forehead and scalp following herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
