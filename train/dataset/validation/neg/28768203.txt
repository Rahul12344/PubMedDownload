Low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) have caused a global concern
to public health since the first novel LPAIV H7N9 outbreak occurred. The
receptor-binding properties of the viral hemagglutinin are one key factor for
efficient transmission and infection in humans. Recent evidence shows that H4
subtype viruses have been widely circulating in domestic poultry and human
asymptomatic infections might have occurred. Here, we evaluated the
receptor-binding properties of two representative isolates, avian H4N6
(containing Q226 and G228) and swine H4N6 (containing L226 and S228), and found
that the avian isolate preferentially binds to avian receptors, whereas the swine
isolate preferentially binds to human receptors. The Q226L and G228S
substitutions are pivotal for the receptor-binding switch, which resulted in
similar human receptor-binding features to the pandemic H2 and H3, implying that 
H4 has the potential to cause human infections. This early-warning study calls
for future extensive surveillance.
