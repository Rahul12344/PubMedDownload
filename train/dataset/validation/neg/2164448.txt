The morphological features of a spontaneous, multifocal vascular neoplasm of
chickens are described. Histologically, the tumor was characterized by areas
consisting of freely anastomosing vascular channels with prominent papillary
appearance and lined by bland-looking endothelial cells, which alternate with
areas resembling cavernous hemangioma. Occasionally solid areas composed of
plump, pleomorphic cells were also present. Although there was no clear evidence 
for metastatic spread, some tumors were obviously invasive. Electron microscopy
and immunohistochemistry confirmed the endothelial nature of neoplastic cells,
demonstrating in particular pinocytic vesicles, well developed junctional
complexes, fragmented basal lamina, occasional Weibel-Palade bodies, and patchy
factor VIII-related antigen immunoreactivity. The overall appearance of the tumor
was that of a cavernous hemangioma with prominent papillary endothelial
hyperplasia. Previously we have shown that the tumor was induced by a newly
isolated strain of avian hemangioma retrovirus and in this study we demonstrated 
typical type C retrovirus particles in the tumor by electron microscopy. It is
suggested that this retrovirus-induced avian tumor may serve as a useful model
for the study of transformed endothelia and other vascular tumorigenesis.
