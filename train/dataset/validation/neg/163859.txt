Spleen cell-mediated cytotoxicity of hamster cells transformed by Herpes simplex 
virus: evidence for virus-specific membrane antigen.

Lausch RN, Jones C, Christie D, Hay KA, Rapp F.

The nature of the host's immune response to isografts of hamster embryo
fibroblasts (HEF) transformed by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was
investigated by the microcytotoxicity assay. It was found that spleen cells from 
tumor-bearing hamsters killed homologous tumor cells but not HEF transformed by
cytomegalovirus or PARA-(defective SV40)-adenovirus 7 (PARA-7). Cytotoxicity was 
lost as the tumor increased in size. Spleen cells from animals bearing isografts 
of HSV type 2 (HSV-2) transformed cells also killed HSV-1 target cells whereas
spleen cells from PARA-7 tumor bearers did not. Further studies showed that
animals immunized with HSV-1 or HSV-1-infected rabbit kidney cells produced
spleen cells specifically cytotoxic for HSV-transformed cells. On the other hand,
sera from virus-immunized hosts or tumor bearers had no effect on the cells in
the presence of guinea pig complement. However, in blocking experiments such sera
could significantly reduce spleen cell cytotoxicity. These experiments
established that cells transformed by HSV could elicit a cellular immune response
in the syngeneic host, and provided evidence that the immunity was directed
against virus-specific antigens on the cell surface.
