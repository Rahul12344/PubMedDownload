CD4+ T cells die in individuals infected with HIV, either as a result of direct
HIV infection or as uninfected "innocent bystanders". Possible mechanisms for
bystander killing include generation of viral products such as Tat or gp120 and
expression of death receptor ligands, such as FasL, that engage functional death 
receptors on uninfected cells. This review covers the sometimes conflicting in
vitro and ex vivo studies that address these possible mechanisms of
HIV-associated cell death. It is an intriguing possibility that manipulation of
cell death processes, to decrease bystander death or increase death of infected
cells, in patients infected with HIV might provide a useful adjunct to
antiretroviral therapy.
