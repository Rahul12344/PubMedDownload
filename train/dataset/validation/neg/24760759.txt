Infections with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) have a huge economic impact on
cattle production and reproduction worldwide. A key factor for BVDV surveillance 
and eventual eradication is to efficiently detect infections and to monitor herd 
immunity. In this study, we generated a stable, bi-cistronic BVDV that encoded
EGFP in addition to the viral proteins. Applying this recombinant virus, a new
flow-cytometry-based virus neutralization test was established that enabled
accurate and reliable detection of field-virus-infected and vaccinated animals.
The test, which is simple and fast, is expected to support novel, effective
screening procedures in eradication and vaccination programmes.
