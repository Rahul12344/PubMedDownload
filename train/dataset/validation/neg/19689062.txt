OBJECTIVE: Developing a rapid method to detect influenza virus N2 subtype by
fluorescence real-time quantitative RT-PCR.
METHODS: According to conservative sequences of NA gene of influenza virus N2
subtype, a pair primers and Taq-man probe were designed, respectively. Using one 
step RT-PCR kit to set up real-time RT-PCR system for detection of influenza
virus N2 subtype, after the standard quantitative curve of the assay was
established using 10-fold serial dilution of TCID50, the sensitivity was
determined. The specificity and test for influenza virus illness (ILI) samples
were also determined using this RT-PCR system.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of detection influenza virus N2 subtype was 2.56 x
10(-6) and the regression coefficient of the quantitative curve was 0.997. The
amplification efficiency and specificity of this assay was 99.9% and 100%,
respectively. The real-time RT-PCR for N2 subtype results of ILI samples was in
accordance with HAI method completely.
CONCLUSION: The detection system based on real-time RT-PCR could be utilized to
rapidly and sensitively detect influenza virus N2 subtype.
