Shutoff of host RNA synthesis in bacteriophage T4-infected Escherichia coli in
the absence of host DNA degradation and nuclear disruption.

Snustad DP, Bursch CJ.

In contrast to its effect on host DNA synthesis, nuclear disruption in phage
T4-infected Escherichia coli B/5 cells has no effect on the shutoff of host RNA
synthesis. Host RNA synthesis is shut off normally after infection with T4
multiple mutants that fail to induce both nuclear disruption and host DNA
degradation.
