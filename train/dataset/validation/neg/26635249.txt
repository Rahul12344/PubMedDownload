Understanding the mechanism of protective antibody recognition against highly
pathogenic avian influenza A virus H5N1 in humans is critical for the development
of effective therapies and vaccines. Here we report the crystal structure of
three H5-specific human monoclonal antibodies bound to the globular head of
hemagglutinin (HA) with distinct epitope specificities, neutralization potencies 
and breadth. A structural and functional analysis of these epitopes combined with
those reported elsewhere identifies four major vulnerable sites on the globular
head of H5N1 HA. Chimeric and vulnerable site-specific mutant pseudoviruses are
generated to delineate broad neutralization specificities of convalescent sera
from two individuals who recovered from the infection with H5N1 virus. Our
results show that the four vulnerable sites on the globular head rather than the 
stem region are the major neutralizing targets, suggesting that during natural
H5N1 infection neutralizing antibodies against the globular head work in concert 
to provide protective antibody-mediated immunity.
