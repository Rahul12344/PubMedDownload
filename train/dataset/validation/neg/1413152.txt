The purpose of this study was to review the extent of the HIV-epidemic and to
make a prognosis about the number of AIDS-cases among drug addicts in the
community of Copenhagen. In the public institutions for treatment of drug
addicts, 191 HIV-positive individuals were known by January 1991. In the period
August 1990-November 1991, 33 newly recognized cases of seropositivity were
registered among drug addicts in the area of Copenhagen, but the time of
infection was unknown. By October 1991, 53 cases of AIDS among drug addicts in
Denmark were recorded. Based upon the knowledge of incubation period and
mortality of AIDS, it was possible to set up a mathematical model, from which the
number of expected AIDS-cases could be estimated. This model showed that the
number of living drug addicts with AIDS in the community of Copenhagen probably
not will exceed 20 during the coming years. It was also showed, that the number
of drug addicts, who were infected with HIV in the primary spread of the virus in
1985-1986, was probably lower than 250. The actual prevalence and incidence of
HIV-infection among drug addicts is uncertain, and there is a need for better
surveillance of the epidemic.
