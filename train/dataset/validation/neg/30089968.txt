correlates of depression among women living with HIV/AIDS.

medical college hospital in North Karnataka and cross-sectional design.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted among of 145 women living with
HIV/AIDS, depression was assessed using Beck Depression Inventory, and social
support was assessed using Lubben Social Network Scale and quality of life (QoL) 
using the World Health Organization QoL BREF scale.
Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences version 20.0. Chi-square test with P value less than 0.05 was
taken as statistically significant.
Results: Among 145 HIV-positive women, 50 (34.5%) were depressed. Depression was 
statistically significant in women from rural background. Significant association
between depression and risk of social isolation was observed. Scores of all
domains of QoL, that is, physical, psychological, social, and environmental were 
reducing with increase in the severity of depression indicating that QoL was
decreasing with increase in severity of depression. Among the four domains,
