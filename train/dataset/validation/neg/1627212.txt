As the indications for zidovudine (ZDV) treatment in human immunodeficiency
virus-infected individuals expand, we anticipate an increased use of this drug
during pregnancy. We report pharmacokinetics data from a patient studied both in 
the third trimester and intrapartum. ZDV peak-plasma levels and serum half-lives 
were comparable to nonpregnant adults. High concentrations of ZDV and its
glucuronide metabolite were found in umbilical cord blood and in amniotic fluid.
