To examine the effectiveness of three psychoeducational interventions in reducing
emotional distress after voluntary serologic testing for human immunodeficiency
virus-1,307 physically asymptomatic adults were randomly assigned to standard
counseling, counseling plus a three-session interactive video program, or
counseling plus six individual sessions of stress prevention training. Subjects
were evaluated using five standardized distress measures at entry and 3 months
later. Among the 204 human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative subjects, mean
distress measures decreased significantly after all three interventions without
differential treatment effects. Among the 103 human immunodeficiency
virus-seropositive subjects, mean distress measures decreased significantly after
the stress prevention training and did not significantly increase in the other
two interventions. We conclude that stress prevention training is particularly
helpful after notification of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity.
