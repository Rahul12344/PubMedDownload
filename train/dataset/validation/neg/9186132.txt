PURPOSE: To report the value of polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of a
worsening corneal ulcer.
METHODS: A 6-year-old boy underwent an emergent penetrating keratoplasty for a
corneal ulcer that continued to worsen despite intensive antibiotic therapy.
RESULTS: Examination of the corneal specimen by polymerase chain reaction was
positive for varicella-zoster virus but negative for herpes simplex. Based on
polymerase chain reaction studies, we diagnosed primary varicella-zoster
keratitis with corneal perforation. Electron microscopy showed herpetic virus
particles in the cornea.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymerase chain reaction analysis of corneal buttons at the time of
penetrating keratoplasty may benefit patients with undiagnosed recalcitrant
corneal ulcers.
