A series of new compounds, carbocyclic oxetanocins, have been synthesized and
their anti-herpesvirus activity determined. Carbocyclic oxetanocin G (OXT-G) was 
most active against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
among carbocyclic oxetanocins tested; the median effective concentrations (EC50) 
for HSV-1, -2, and HCMV were 0.23, 0.04 and 0.40 micrograms/ml, respectively. The
EC50 value of carbocyclic OXT-G against HSV-2 was significantly lower than those 
of acyclovir, ganciclovir (DHPG) and OXT-G, while the value for HCMV was
comparable to those of DHPG and OXT-G. Carbocyclic OXT-G showed much higher
activity against TK+ HSV-2 than against a TK- mutant, suggesting that this
compound is a good substrate for HSV-2-induced TK. The antiviral activity of the 
compound was only partially reversed even by the addition of 100-fold excess
deoxyguanosine. The results suggest that the mode of action of carbocyclic OXT-G 
is different from that of OXT-G.
