For public health safety, vaccines and other pharmaceutical products as well as
the raw materials used in their manufacture need to be tested for adventitious
virus contamination. The current standard of practice is to develop culture-based
or polymerase chain reaction assays for the types of viruses one might expect
based upon the source of reagents used. High-throughput sequencing technology is 
well-suited for building an unbiased strategy for the purpose of adventitious
virus detection. We have developed an approach to automate curation of publically
available nucleotide sequences, and have practically balanced the desire to
capture all viral diversity while simultaneously reducing the use of partial
viral sequences that represent the largest source of false positive results. In
addition, we describe an effective workflow for virus detection that can process 
sequence data from all currently available High-throughput sequencing
technologies and produce a report that summarizes the weight of sequence data in 
support of each detected virus.
