Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also named Human herpesvirus 8
HHV-8) is the cause of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common malignancy in
HIV-infected individuals worldwide, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and
multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). KSHV is a double-stranded DNA virus that
encodes several homologues of cellular proteins. The structural similarity
between viral and host proteins explains why some viral homologues function as
their host counterparts, but sometimes at unusual anatomical sites and
inappropriate times. In other cases, structural modification in the viral
proteins can suppress or override the function of the host homologue,
contributing to KSHV-related diseases. For example, viral IL-6 (vIL-6) is
sufficiently different from human IL-6 to activate gp130 signaling independent of
the Î± subunit. As a consequence, vIL-6 can activate many cell types that are
unresponsive to cellular IL-6, contributing to MCD disease manifestations. Here, 
we discuss the molecular biology of KSHV homologues of cellular products as
conduits of virus/host interaction with a focus on identifying new strategies for
therapy of KS and other KSHV-related diseases.
