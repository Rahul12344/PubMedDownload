There are over 350 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the
world, of whom about a third eventually develop severe HBV-related complications.
HBV contributes to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma development.
Remarkable progress has been made in selective inhibition of HBV replication by
nucleoside analogs. However, how to generate protective antibody of HBsAb in
HBV-infected patients after HBV-DNA becomes negative still remains a challenge
for scientists. In this study, we show that OmpC-HBsAg 'a' epitope chimeric
protein vaccine can break HBV tolerance and induce protective immunity in HBV
transgenic mice based on mimicking T cell-independent antigen to bypass T cells
from the adaptive immune system. The antibodies induced by the vaccine have the
ability to prevent HBV virion infection of human hepatocytes.
