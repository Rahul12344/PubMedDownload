49 French haemophiliacs (haemophilia A: 41 patients; haemophilia B: 8 patients)
were serologically testes for lymphadenopathy-AIDS virus antibodies: 10 patients 
(20.4%) were seropositive including 9 (21.9%) with haemophilia A and 1 (12.5%)
with haemophilia B. Among haemophiliacs A, seropositive patients received
significantly larger amounts of factor VIII concentrate during the 2 years
preceding the study.
