In the absence of effective prophylaxis and treatment, therapeutic options in
HIV-positive patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are
limited to antiretroviral therapy: nevertheless, outcome is poor. We conducted a 
retrospective study (2009-2015) describing the outcome of 25 HIV-positive
patients with detectable cerebrospinal fluid JC virus DNA: 14 had a probable PML 
while the others had evidence of other inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) 
affecting disorders. In the former group, 6-month mortality was 45.5% vs 21.4 in 
the latter one: survival was higher than previously described but no predictor of
poor outcome was identified. Two patients treated with 5HT2-inhibitors survived. 
The contributing role of JCV replication in other CNS-affecting disorders needs
to be assessed as well as the benefits of 5HT2-inhibitors in HIV-positive
patients with proven PML.
