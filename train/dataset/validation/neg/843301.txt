Aerosol vaccination against Newcastle disease. III. Field experiments in broiler 
chickens.

Villegas P, Anderson DP, Kleven SH, Vezey SA.

Two different aerosol generators were used for aerosol-vaccination of 128,000
broiler-type chickens having moderate to low maternal antibody titers with the B1
and LaSota strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Efficacy of vaccination was 
evaluated from resistance to challenge with a velogenic strain (Texas GB) of NDV 
and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers, Both aerosol generators
induced adequate immune response at the aperture settings used. There was little 
detectable benefit from vaccination at 1 day old, but antibody response and
resistance to challenge were good from vaccination at 10 and 28 days of age.
