The cervical infection by human papilloma virus (HPV) is considered one of the
most common sexual transmitted diseases. Fifty couples were studied which
consulted for sterility, in all women a cervical HPV infection was detected.
Colposcopy, cervical biopsy, vaginal secretions culture, hysterosalpingography,
laparoscopy and semen analysis were performed, in all of them. Age, obstetrical
history, age at which patients began sexual relations, number of sexual partners,
usage and time of usage of intrauterine device were analyzed. We can conclude
that patients HPV cervical infection have risk factors for tuboperitoneal
sterility, and are also in risk for other sexual transmitted diseases.
