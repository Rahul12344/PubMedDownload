Mounting evidence indicates that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), a circular
double-stranded DNA virus, is a causal factor underlying a highly lethal form of 
skin cancer known as Merkel cell carcinoma. To explore the possibility that MCV
and other polyomaviruses commonly inhabit healthy human skin, we developed an
improved rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique to isolate circular DNA
viral genomes from human skin swabs. Complete MCV genomes were recovered from 40%
of healthy adult volunteers tested, providing full-length, apparently wild-type
cloned MCV genomes. RCA analysis also identified two previously unknown
polyomavirus species that we name human polyomavirus-6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7.
Biochemical experiments show that polyomavirus DNA is shed from the skin in the
form of assembled virions. A pilot serological study indicates that infection or 
coinfection with these three skin-tropic polyomaviruses is very common. Thus, at 
least three polyomavirus species are constituents of the human skin microbiome.
