High-efficiency target capture is an essential prerequisite for sensitive
immunoassays. However, the current available immunoassay approaches are subject
to deficient binding affinities between predator-prey molecules that greatly
restrict the target capture efficiency and immunoassay sensitivity. Herein, we
present a new strategy through the self-assembly of antigen proteins into
nanowires to enhance the binding affinity between an antigen and antibody.
Through the genetic fusion of antigen proteins (e.g., HIV p24) with the yeast
amyloid protein Sup35 self-assembly domain, specific antigen nanowires (Ag
nanowires) were constructed and demonstrated a remarkable enhancement in binding 
affinity compared with that of the monomeric antigen molecule. The Ag nanowires
were further combined with magnetic beads to form a 3D magnetic probe based on a 
seed-induced self-assembly strategy. Taking advantage of both the strong binding 
affinity and the rapid magnetic separation and enrichment capacity, the specific 
3D magnetic probe achieved a 100-fold improvement in detection sensitivity within
a significantly shorter period of 20 min over that of the conventional
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.
