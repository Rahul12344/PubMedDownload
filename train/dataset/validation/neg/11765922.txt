Rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) open reading frame R44 is the homolog of human
cytomegalovirus gene UL44, which encodes the DNA polymerase accessory protein.
Here, we show that R44 is transcribed as a 3.6-kb mRNA within the early and late 
phases of infection in vitro. In order to find potential monoclonal antibodies
(MoAbs) directed against the R44-encoded protein (pR44), a panel of anti-RCMV
MoAbs was screened for binding to pR44 recombinant proteins. Thus, an anti-pR44
MoAb, termed RCMV8, was identified. By using this MoAb, pR44 could be detected as
early as 8 h after RCMV infection in vitro. The pR44 protein was determined to
have a molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa and was found to be localized to
the nucleus of RCMV-infected cells.
