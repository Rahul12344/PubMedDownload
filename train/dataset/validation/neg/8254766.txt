The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease is cleaved at two autoprocessing
sites during viral maturation, one of which shares amino acid identity with its
substrate, ICP35. Similar autoprocessing sites have been observed within other
members of the Herpesviridae. Introduction of point mutations within the
autoprocessing sites of the HSV-1 protease indicated that specificity resides
within the P4-P1' region of the cleavage sites.
