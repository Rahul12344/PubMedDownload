BACKGROUND: Previous cohort studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) on viral load suppression. We aimed to examine the
factors associated with virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients on ART
receiving care at the Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute, Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
METHODS: HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts at the date closest to midyear
(1 July) were evaluated for 1,678 ART-naïve patients ≥ 18 years of age initiating
ART between 1997 and 2010. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
for having an undetectable viral load (≤ 400 copies/mL) were estimated using
generalized estimating equations regression models adjusted for clinical and
demographic factors. Time-updated covariates included age, years since HIV
diagnosis, hepatitis C diagnosis and ART interruptions.
RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2011, the proportion of patients with an undetectable
viral load increased from 6% to 78% and the median [interquartile range] CD4+
T-cell count increased from 207 [162, 343] to 554 [382, 743] cells/μL.
Pre-treatment median CD4+ T-cell count significantly increased over the
observation period from 114 [37, 161] to 237 [76, 333] cells/μL (p < .001). The
per-year adjusted OR (aOR) for having undetectable viral load was 1.18 (95% CI = 
1.16-1.21). ART interruptions >1 month per calendar significantly decreased the
odds [aOR = 0.32 (95% CI = 0.27-0.38)] of having an undetectable viral load.
Patients initiating on a protease inhibitor (PI)-based first-line regimen were
less likely to have undetectable viral load [aOR = 0.72 (95% CI = 0.63-0.83)]
compared to those initiating on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI)-based regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate significant improvements in virologic
outcomes from 1997 to 2011, which persisted after adjusting for other factors.
This may in part be due to improvements in care and new treatment options. NNRTI-
versus PI-based first-line regimens were found to be associated with increased
odds of having an undetectable viral load, consistent with previous studies.
Treatment interruptions were found to be the most important determinant of not
having an undetectable viral load. Studies are needed to characterize the reasons
for treatment interruptions and to develop subsequent strategies for improving
adherence to ART.
