We report two cases of Ross River virus (RRV) infection in Dutch travellers who
visited Australia during February to April 2015. These cases coincided with the
largest recorded outbreak of RRV disease in Australia since 1996. This report
serves to create awareness among physicians to consider travel-related RRV
disease in differential diagnosis of patients with fever, arthralgia and/or rash 
returning from the South Pacific area, and to promote awareness among
professionals advising travellers to this region.
