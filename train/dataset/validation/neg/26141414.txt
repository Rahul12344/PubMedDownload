OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a major cause of premalignant
dysplasia and cervical cancer. There are no data on the prevalence of
genotype-specific HPV infection assessed by HPV E6/E7 mRNA in women
representative of the Korean population across a broad age range.
METHODS: A total of 630 women aged 17-90 years were enrolled in this study.
ThinPrep liquid-based cytology samples were evaluated using the CervicGen HPV
RT-qDx assay, which detects 16 high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes (set 1: HPV 16, 31,
33, 35, 52, and 58; set 2: HPV 18, 39, 45, 51, 59, and 68; and set 3: HPV 53, 56,
66, and 69).
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV infection was 33.2% (n=209), and oncogenic
high-risk HPV was detected in 75.9% (n=107) of 141 women with high-grade cervical
lesions. HPV 16 was the most common HPV genotype among women with high-grade
cervical lesions and histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 
grade 2 and above (CIN2+) in the Republic of Korea (41.6%). Among women aged over
30 years, 182/329 (55%) had invasive cervical cancer and 135 (74%) of these were 
infected with oncogenic HR-HPV types (in particular 25% with HPV 16). Among
patients diagnosed with CIN2+, the positivity rate of HR-HPV was the highest in
women aged 40-49 years.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the determination of specific HPV
genotypes is very important for evaluating the potential impact of preventive
measures, including the use of prophylactic vaccines, on reducing the burden of
cervical cancer.
