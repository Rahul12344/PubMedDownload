BACKGROUND: There are limited data on primary human immunodeficiency virus drug
resistance (HIVDR) in pediatric populations. This study aimed to assess the
prevalence of primary HIVDR and associated risk factors among children initiating
first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda.
METHODS: At three Ugandan clinics, children (age <12 years) requiring ART were
recruited between January 2010 and August 2011. Before starting ART, blood was
collected for viral load and pol gene sequencing. Drug resistance mutations were 
determined using the 2010 International AIDS Society-USA mutation list. Risk
factors for HIVDR were assessed with multivariate regression analysis.
RESULTS: Three hundred nineteen HIV-infected children with a median age of 4.9
years were enrolled. Sequencing was successful in 279 children (87.5%). HIVDR was
present in 10% of all children and 15.2% of children <3 years. Nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTI (NNRTI), and dual-class resistance was
present in 5.7%, 7.5%, and 3.2%, respectively. HIVDR occurred in 35.7% of
prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)-exposed children, 15.6% in
children with unknown PMTCT history, and 7.7% among antiretroviral-naive
children. History of PMTCT exposure [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.6, 95% CI:
1.3-5.1] or unknown PMTCT status (AOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.1-13.5), low CD4 (AOR: 2.2,
95% CI: 1.3-3.6), current breastfeeding (AOR: 7.4, 95% CI: 2.6-21), and current
maternal ART use (AOR: 6.4, 95% CI: 3.4-11.9) emerged as risk factors for primary
HIVDR in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment HIVDR is high, especially in children with PMTCT
exposure. Protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens are advocated by the World
Health Organization, but availability in children is limited. Children with
(unknown) PMTCT exposure, low CD4 count, current breastfeeding, or maternal ART
need to be prioritized to receive PI-based regimens.
