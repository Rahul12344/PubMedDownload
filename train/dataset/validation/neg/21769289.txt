This report presents the case of a 78-year-old female with hepatic encephalopathy
due to an inferior mesenteric venous-inferior vena cava shunt. She developed
hepatocellular carcinoma affected by hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and
underwent posterior sectionectomy. Portal vein thrombosis developed and the
portal trunk was narrowed after hepatectomy. Portal vein thrombosis resulted in
high portal pressure and increased blood flow in an inferior mesenteric
venous-inferior vena cava shunt, and hepatic encephalopathy with hyperammonemia
was aggravated. The hepatic encephalopathy aggravated by portal vein thrombosis
was successfully treated by balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration 
via a right transjugular venous approach without the development of other
collateral vessels.
