Determinants of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus].

Liu X, Wang F, Wen Y.

The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can cause
reproductive barriers in breeding pigs and respiratory symptoms in piglets. In
this review, we summarize research progress of the infection and replication
mechanisms of the PRRSV. We also review the virulence determinants of the PRRSV. 
All these fundamental studies are important for the control and elimination of
the PRRSV.
