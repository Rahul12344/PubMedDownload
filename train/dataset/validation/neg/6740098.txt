The standardization of vaccines: a discussion.

Perkins FT.

Many changes have been made in the World Health Organization's (WHO) requirements
for the production and control of both the killed and live (oral) poliovirus
vaccines since their initial formulations in 1959 and 1962, respectively. The
major changes in the production of killed vaccine concern the cell substrates
used from primary tissue to passaged primary tissue or even a continuous cell
line such as Vero. It has been shown also that there is no longer the necessity
to test for residual infectious virus by the inoculation of monkeys, since cell
cultures are much more sensitive for this purpose. For the live vaccine, a more
uniform test for the titration of virus content has been introduced. Furthermore,
international agreement on the details of the test for neurovirulence in monkeys 
has been reached. The expression of the immunogen of poliovirus in eukaryotic
cells has been achieved, but whether it becomes a commercial proposition
replacing one or both of our present vaccines remains to be seen.
