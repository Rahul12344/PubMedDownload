Cryptococcus neoformans causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis, particularly
in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals with low CD4 levels
(<100 cells/μL). Although the burden of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) in 
Turkey is low (0.13 cases per 100 000 persons), asymptomatic individuals at risk 
of cryptococcosis should be screened for antigenemia to prevent the disease
and/or promote early CM diagnosis. A lateral flow assay (LFA) is used to detect
Cryptococcus antigen (CrAg) in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. We determined
Cryptococcus antigenemia prevalence in serum samples of HIV-positive and
HIV-negative adult patients by using Dynamiker® CrAg-LFA, a point-of-care
dipstick test. Patients' demographic data, CD4 count, HIV-RNA levels and
anti-retroviral therapy status were recorded. CrAg was detected in 28 (11%) of
254 HIV-positive patients screened but not in 100 HIV-negative control
individuals; a significant difference was observed in the CrAg-LFA positivity
rate between HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (x2  = 11.970; P < .05). In
CrAg-positive patients, the median CD4 level was 666 cells/μL
(115-1344 cells/μL), with a median viral load of 23 copies/mL (0-3.69 × 106
 copies/mL). In HIV-positive CrAg-negative patients, the median CD4 level was
633 cells/μL (31-2953 cells/μL) and the median viral load was 12 copies/mL
(0-1.95 × 106  copies/mL; P > .05). Results indicate that HIV-positive patients
with both low (<200 cells/μL) and high (>200 cells/μL) CD4 counts should be
screened for asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia. HIV-associated asymptomatic
cryptococcosis is not uncommon in Turkey, which warrants systematic screening.
Updated strategies for CM prevention among HIV-positive patients should be used
even in non-endemic countries.
