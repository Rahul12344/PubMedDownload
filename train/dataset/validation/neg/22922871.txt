Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and
shows a propensity to metastasize and infiltrate adjacent and more distant
tissues. HCC is associated with multiple risk factors, including hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection, which is especially prevalent in China. Here, we used
exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in ten HBV-positive individuals
with HCC with portal vein tumor thromboses (PVTTs), intrahepatic metastases. Both
C:G>A:T and T:A>A:T transversions were frequently found among the 331 non-silent 
mutations. Notably, ARID1A, which encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex, was mutated in 14 of 110 (13%) HBV-associated HCC specimens. 
We used RNA interference to assess the roles of 91 of the confirmed mutated genes
in cellular survival. The results suggest that seven of these genes, including
VCAM1 and CDK14, may confer growth and infiltration capacity to HCC cells. This
study provides a view of the landscape of somatic mutations that may be
implicated in advanced HCC.
