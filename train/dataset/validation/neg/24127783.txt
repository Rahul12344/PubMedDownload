BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA detection in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after recovery from HCV infection, is a type of occult 
HCV infection although is unclear how the viral persistence in PBMCs affects
HCV-specific T-cell responses. The aim of this study was to investigate if
cellular immune responses are modified by HCV persistence in PBMCs.
METHODS: HCV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses against six HCV
peptides, situated within the non-structural (NS) proteins NS3, NS4b and NS5b,
were measured by flow cytometry-through intracellular detection of gamma
interferon (IFN-γ) or interleukin 4 (IL-4) and CD69 expression- in 27 sustained
virological responders (SVR): 13 with and 14 without occult HCV infection in
PBMCs, detected by strand-specific real-time PCR. Ten healthy individuals and 14 
chronically infected patients with viraemia, were included as controls.
RESULTS: SVR without occult infection showed a higher percentage of activated
CD4(+) cells against peptides belonging to NS3 (p124, p153) and NS5b (p257,
p294), activated CD8(+) cells against NS3 (p124, p153, p158) and NS5b-p294, as
well as an elevated percentage of CD4(+) cells releasing IFN-γ + IL-4 against
NS3-p153, and by CD8(+) cells against NS3 (p124, p153). SVR without occult
infection showed a higher percentage of activation and release of IFN-γ + IL-4 by
both cell subpopulations than the two group of controls, in contrast to SVR with 
occult infection.
CONCLUSION: The lower HCV-specific T-cell response found in SVR with occult
infection indicates that the immune response may be impaired when the virus
persists in PBMCs.
