Thiocyanate and hydroxyl ions inactivate the scrapie agent.

To probe the macromolecular structure of the scrapie agent and explore conditions
for monomerization, the stability of the agent in low concentrations of inorganic
ions was determined. A reduction by a factor of 10(5) in scrapie titer was found 
on exposure of the agent to 1 M KSCN or 0.3 M NaOH. In addition to the
inactivation by thiocyanate ions, other chaotropic ions such as guanidinium and
trichloroacetate inactivate the scrapie agent. Removal of thiocyanate ions by
dialysis or glass permeation chromatography prevented the reduction in scrapie
agent infectivity. Addition of equimolar amounts of (NH4)2SO4, a nonchaotrope, to
preparations containing 1 M KSCN also prevented the loss of scrapie infectivity. 
In contrast, neutralization of the alkali-treated fractions with HCl did not
restore infectivity. Acidification of partially purified fractions did not cause 
inactivation of the agent but did result in precipitation of the infectious
agent. Inactivation by relatively low concentrations of chaotropic ions is
consistent with many observations, all of which suggest that the scrapie agent
contains a protein component that is essential for the maintenance of
infectivity. Thus, it is unlikely that the agent is composed only of a "naked"
nucleic acid. Certainly, if the agent were a naked nucleic acid, its lability in 
alkali virtually eliminates the possibility that it is composed of a
single-stranded molecule of DNA.
