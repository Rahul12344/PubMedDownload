To assess the expression of an hypothetical protein F154 encoded in an open
reading frame of the DNA sequence of the virus TTV1 identified in the
archaebacterium Thermoproteus tenax, two synthetic peptides related to
characteristic repeats of the primary structure and corresponding to the sequence
portions [Ser81] (73-84) and (79-101) were selectively grafted at their N-termini
to the surface-exposed single cysteine residue of iso-1-cytochrome c via the
maleimide thiol principle. Antisera were raised in rabbits against the two
conjugates and the antipeptide-(79-101) immunoselected antibodies were found to
crossreact with a strong protein band in Western blots of cell lysates of
TTV1-infected bacteria, thus confirming expression of the protein F154 in
Thermoproteus tenax.
