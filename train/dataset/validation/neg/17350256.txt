A recently disclosed series of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine inhibitors of herpes virus
replication has been closely examined herein for effects of the C3 substituent on
antiviral activity. Significant changes in activity are observed by alterations
of the heteroatom basicity and orientation of the group at C3. These results in
combination with previous studies have served to further elaborate the minimal
pharmacophore required for potency of this novel series of antiviral agents.
During the course of these studies, several novel synthetic approaches were
developed and are described.
