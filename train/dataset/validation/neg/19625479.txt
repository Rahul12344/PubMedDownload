We compared a DNA-based assay with a total nucleic acid-based assay for early
detection of infant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The codetection
of DNA and RNA did not result in an overall higher sensitivity compared to that
of DNA alone. Discordant results were associated with low levels of HIV DNA,
indicating that the sample amount may be critical.
