We described the antiviral activity of an octapeptide corresponding to a Trp-rich
domain of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) transmembrane glycoprotein. To
overcome the limited enzymatic stability of short peptides, the retroinverso
analogue was prepared and tested for inhibitory activity of FIV in the presence
or absence of normal cat serum. Differently from the unmodified peptide, the
retroinverso analogue maintains strong inhibitory activity in serum. NMR studies 
showed that it displays crucial conformational features believed to be important 
for antiviral activity.
