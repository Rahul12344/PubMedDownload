Adenovirus-based drugs are efficient when combined with other anticancer
treatments. Here we show that treatment with LY294002 and LY303511 upregulates
expression of recombinant proteins encoded by replication-defective adenoviruses,
including expression of therapeutically valuable combination of herpes simplex
virus thymidine kinase controlled by human telomerase reverse transcriptase
promoter (Ad-hTERT-HSVtk). In line with this, treatment with LY294002 synergized 
with Ad-hTERT-HSVtk infection in the presence of gancyclovir prodrug on Calu-I
lung cancer cell death. The effect of LY294002 and LY303511 on
adenovirus-delivered transgene expression was demonstrated in 4 human lung cancer
cell lines. LY294002-induced upregulation of adenovirally delivered transgene is 
mediated in part by direct inhibition of mTOR protein kinase in mTORC2 signaling 
complex thus suggesting that anticancer drugs targeting mTOR will also enhance
expression of transgenes delivered with adenoviral vectors. As both LY294002 and 
LY303511 are candidate prototypic anticancer drugs, and many mTOR inhibitors for 
cancer treatment are under development, our results have important implication
for development of future therapeutic strategies with adenoviral gene delivery.
