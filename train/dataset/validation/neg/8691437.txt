Ethyl 2-alkyl-4-aryl-3-oxobutyrates were synthesized from the corresponding
arylacetonitriles and 2-bromo esters. Condensation of the butyrates with thiourea
followed by treatment with chloroacetic acid afforded the
5-alkyl-6-(arylmethyl)uracils. Condensation of the uracils with acetals using
trimethylsilyl triflate (TMS triflate) as a catalyst gave acyclic
5-alkyl-6-(arylmethyl)uracil derivatives. 6-Benzyl-5-ethyluracil was also
condensed with methyl
5-O-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)-2-deoxy-3-O-(phenoxythiocarbonyl+
++)-alpha,beta-D-erythro-pentofuranoside, followed by Barton reduction and
deprotection, to give the anomers of 6-benzyl-5-ethyl-2',3'-dideoxyuridine.
Alkylation of the uracils with alkyl chloromethyl sulfides gave new thio
analogues of HEPT. All new N1-substituted uracils were tested for activity
against HIV-1, and the thio analogues were found extremely potent.
