In the decade since the first human retrovirus was identified, one form of
leukemia and a chronic neurological disorder have been shown to be related to
this agent. A spectrum of lymphomas, additional inflammatory disorders such as
polymyositis, and possibly other neurological diseases also have been linked to
HTLV-I infection. Although the pathogenesis of these disorders remains to be
defined, these exciting developments coupled with the discovery that AIDS is a
retroviral-induced disease indicate that human retroviruses are responsible for a
variety of human disorders and suggest that other agents such as members of the
foamy virus subfamily, as well as yet unidentified human retroviruses, may
produce other human diseases.
