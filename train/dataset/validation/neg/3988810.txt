Oxonol dyes as monitors of membrane potential: the effect of viruses and toxins
on the plasma membrane potential of animal cells in monolayer culture and in
suspension.

Optical indicators of the cationic, cyanine and anionic oxonol classes were used 
to evaluate the plasma membrane potential of animal cells in suspension and in
monolayer culture. The optical signals were calibrated by using diffusion
potentials either of K+ (in the presence of valinomycin) or of H+ (in the
presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; FCCP); both
classes of dye gave similar values of plasma membrane potential, in the range -40
to -90 mV for different cell types. Addition of haemolytic Sendai virus or
Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin depolarizes cells and causes them to leak
monovalent cations; these effects are antagonized by extracellular Ca2+. Cells
infected with vesicular stomatitis or Semliki Forest virus become depolarized
during an infectious cycle; infection with other viruses was without affect on
plasma membrane potential.
