Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus (ATCV-1), a prospective member of the
family Phycodnaviridae, genus Chlorovirus, infects a unicellular, eukaryotic,
chlorella-like green alga, Chlorella SAG 3.83, that is a symbiont in the
heliozoon A. turfacea. The 288,047-bp ATCV-1 genome is the first virus to be
sequenced that infects Chlorella SAG 3.83. ATCV-1 contains 329 putative
protein-encoding and 11 tRNA-encoding genes. The protein-encoding genes are
almost evenly distributed on both strands and intergenic space is minimal.
Thirty-four percent of the viral gene products resemble entries in the public
databases, including some that are unexpected for a virus. For example, these
unique gene products include ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase,
dTDP-d-glucose 4,6 dehydratase, potassium ion transporter, aquaglyceroporin, and 
mucin-desulfating sulfatase. Comparison of ATCV-1 protein-encoding genes with the
prototype chlorella virus PBCV-1 indicates that about 80% of the ATCV-1 genes are
present in PBCV-1.
