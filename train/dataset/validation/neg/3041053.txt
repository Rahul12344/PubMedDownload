Studies on the origin-specific DNA-binding domain of simian virus 40 large T
antigen.

Strauss M, Argani P, Mohr IJ, Gluzman Y.

The origin-specific DNA-binding domain of simian virus 40 large T antigen was
analyzed, and its C-terminal boundary was found to be at or before amino acid
259. This does not include the zinc finger structural motif located at amino
acids 302 to 320 (J. M. Berg, Science 232:485-486, 1986). Interestingly,
N-terminal fragments of 266 and 272 amino acids and larger displayed dramatically
reduced origin-binding activity. In addition, the specific DNA-binding properties
of truncated proteins purified from both bacterial and mammalian sources were
compared. Truncated T antigens from mammalian cells bound specific DNA fragments 
more efficiently than did their bacterial counterparts. These results implicate
posttranslational modification with a role in regulating the DNA-binding activity
of large T antigen.
