Retroviral vectors are commonly used in clinical gene therapy, but recent
observations of insertional oncogene activation in preclinical and clinical
settings have forced a discussion of their safety. Here we investigated the
relationship between retroviral transduction efficiency in mass cultures and the 
actual number of integrated vector copies in single cells using K562 leukemia and
primary CD34+ cells. We found an exponential increase of integration numbers
correlated to gene transfer rates and a linear increase of expression levels with
insertion frequency. On average we detected one vector insertion per transduced
cell for a gene transfer of less than 30%, 3 for 60%, and approximately 9 for 90%
(in K562). Clonal analysis revealed strikingly increased variations of both
transgene copy numbers (more than 20-fold in primary cells) and expression levels
associated with higher transduction. Therefore, limiting retroviral gene transfer
to approximately 30% may be suggested to avoid generating clones containing
multiple insertions.
