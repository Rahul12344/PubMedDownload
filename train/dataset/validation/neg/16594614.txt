RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific gene-silencing mechanism that has 
been proposed to function as a defence mechanism of eukaryotic cells against
viruses and transposons. RNAi was first observed in plants in the form of a
mysterious immune response to viral pathogens. But RNAi is more than just a
response to exogenous genetic material. Small RNAs termed microRNA (miRNA)
regulate cellular gene expression programs to control diverse steps in cell
development and physiology. The discovery that exogenously delivered short
interfering RNA (siRNA) can trigger RNAi in mammalian cells has made it into a
powerful technique for generating genetic knock-outs. It also raises the
possibility to use RNAi technology as a therapeutic tool against pathogenic
viruses. Indeed, inhibition of virus replication has been reported for several
human pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus, the hepatitis B and C
viruses and influenza virus. We reviewed the field of antiviral RNAi research in 
2003 (Haasnoot et al. 2003), but many new studies have recently been published.
In this review, we present a complete listing of all antiviral strategies
published up to and including December 2004. The latest developments in the RNAi 
field and their antiviral application are described.
