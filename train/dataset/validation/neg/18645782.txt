Nine outbreaks of a disease affecting 2 to 5-month-old guinea fowl, characterized
by slight depression and sudden deaths, are described. Gross haemorrhages in the 
serosa and muscles were constantly observed. Histologically nuclear inclusion
bodies, similar to those observed in avian adenovirosis group II were detected in
the spleen of affected animals. Electron microscopic examination revealed the
presence of adenovirus particles in spleen ultra-thin sections. The agar-gel
immunodiffusion test, carried out on the sera from one outbreak, demonstrated
reacting antibodies with haemorrhagic enteritis virus of turkeys. The disease was
experimentally reproduced inoculating 35-day-old guinea fowl with spleen
homogenate from affected animals.
