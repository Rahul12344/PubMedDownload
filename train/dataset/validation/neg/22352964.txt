A new single-molecule approach for rapid and purely electronic discrimination
among similar genes is presented. Combining solid-state nanopores and γ-modified 
synthetic peptide nucleic acid probes, we accurately barcode genes by counting
the number of probes attached to each gene and measuring their relative spacing. 
We illustrate our method by sensing individual genes from two highly similar
human immunodeficiency virus subtypes, demonstrating feasibility of a novel,
single-molecule diagnostic platform for rapid pathogen classification.
