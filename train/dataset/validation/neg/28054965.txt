The innate immune system has evolved a number of sensors that recognize viral
RNAÂ (vRNA) to restrict infection, yet the full spectrum of host-encoded RNA
binding proteins that target these foreign RNAs is still unknown. The RNA decay
machinery, which uses exonucleases to degrade aberrant RNAs largely from the 5'
or 3' end, is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in antiviral
defense. The 5' degradation pathway can directly target viral messenger RNA
(mRNA) for degradation, as well as indirectly attenuate replication by limiting
specific pools of endogenous RNAs. The 3' degradation machinery (RNA exosome) is 
emerging as a downstream effector of a diverse array of vRNA sensors. This review
discusses our current understanding of the roles of the RNA decay machinery in
controlling viral infection.
