Chronic viral hepatitis depends on the inability of the T-cell immune response to
eradicate antigen. This results in a sustained immune response accompanied by
tissue injury and fibrogenesis. We have created a mouse model that reproduces
these effects, based on the response of CD8(+) T cells to hepatocellular antigen 
delivered by an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. Ten thousand
antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells undergo slow expansion in the liver and can
precipitate a subacute inflammatory hepatitis with stellate cell activation and
fibrosis. Over time, antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells show signs of exhaustion,
including high expression of PD-1, and eventually both inflammation and fibrosis 
resolve. This model allows the investigation of both chronic liver
immunopathology and its resolution.
