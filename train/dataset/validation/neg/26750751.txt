Arabidopsis thaliana leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) proteins RPS4 and RRS1,
known as dual resistance proteins, confer resistance to multiple pathogen
isolates, such as the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Ralstonia
solanacearum and the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. RPS4 is a
typical Toll/interleukin 1 Receptor (TIR)-type NLR, whereas RRS1 is an atypical
TIR-NLR that contains a leucine zipper (LZ) motif and a C-terminal WRKY domain.
RPS4 and RRS1 are localised near each other in a head-to-head orientation. In
this study, direct mutagenesis of the C-terminal LZ motif in RRS1 caused an
autoimmune response and stunting in the mutant. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis
indicated that full-length RPS4 and RRS1 are physically associated with one
another. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing experiments showed that
hypersensitive-like cell death triggered by RPS4/LZ motif-mutated RRS1 depends on
EDS1. In conclusion, we suggest that the RRS1-LZ motif is crucial for the
regulation of the RPS4/RRS1 complex.
