Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common
in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. It is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis flare and/or hepatic
decompensation. These consequences arising from HBV reactivation are, however,
largely preventable. Routine screening for HBV serologic status is recommended
for all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or biologics. By recognizing
different serological patterns (which represent either overt or occult HBV
infection) and the types of immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a
risk-adapted approach can be established. Prophylactic therapy with nucleos(t)ide
analogues (prior to or concomitantly with the commencement of immunosuppressive
therapies) is more effective than pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when
HBV DNA level is rising) in high-risk individuals. Entecavir has been proven to
be more effective than lamivudine according to recent studies. Close monitoring
of serum HBV level is the preferred strategy in low-risk patients. However, the
optimal interval of DNA monitoring and the duration of therapy remain unknown.
