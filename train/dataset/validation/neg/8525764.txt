Hepatitis B virus infection is responsible of an important number of world
morbimortality. This is associated to severe liver outcome such as cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Diverse factors influence the severity of liver injury 
produced by Hepatitis B Virus (HBV): the emergence of HBV mutants unable to
secrete "e" antigen (pre-core mutants), the virus and host genetic heterogenicity
and immune system competence. Particularly, the presence of pre-core mutants in
chronic carriers is associated a low response to interferon therapy. We present
paper is to present evidence as to the presence of these mutants in chronically
infected, HBeAg negative patients (HBsAg positive) in Argentina. Viral DNAs were 
extracted from sera of nine patients, amplified by PCR and characterized by
restriction enzyme assay. All of them appear to be pre-core mutants according
with serological markers and a very low level of viral DNA detected in serum.
Further genetic characterization of one of them by nucleotide sequence analysis
of the pre-core region let allowed us to show modifications at codon 15 and 28
both of them previously described for pre-core mutants.
