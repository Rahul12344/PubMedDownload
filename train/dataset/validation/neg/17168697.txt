Conventional cancer treatments are often hampered by a lack of tumour
selectivity, resulting in toxicity to healthy tissue. Gene-directed enzyme
prodrug therapy (GDEPT) is a suicide gene therapy approach that aims to improve
the selectivity of chemotherapy by enabling cancer cells to convert non-cytotoxic
prodrugs to cytotoxic drugs. Many enzyme/prodrug systems have been described,
some of which have already been tested in clinical trials. A key component of
GDEPT is a foreign enzyme that is expressed selectively at the tumour site where 
it converts the prodrug into the cytotoxic agent. The gene encoding the
prodrug-activating enzyme needs to be expressed selectively and efficiently in
tumour cells in order to spare normal tissue from damage. Substantial efforts
have been made to develop gene therapy vectors that are capable of targeting
cancer cells. A large number of gene delivery systems have been described for
GDEPT: Viral vectors are the most advanced. They include replication-deficient
and replication-selective (oncolytic) viruses. Recent advances in engineering
viruses for GDEPT are reviewed in this article and data from both preclinical
studies and clinical trials are discussed.
