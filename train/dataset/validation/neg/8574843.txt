A hepatitis B virus (HBV) immune escape variant which results from a substitution
of glycine by arginine at position 145 (arginine-145) in the immunodominant
neutralization epitope of the S protein was found to infect one child in a
seroepidemiologic survey of 1,812 vaccinated children. The child's mother and a
younger brother were also infected by the same HBV variant, despite a greater
than accepted level of protective antibody (anti-HBV surface antigen) in both the
index child (30 mIU/ml) and the brother (> 20,000 mIU/ml). Our findings suggest
the perinatal or horizontal transmission of the arginine-145 HBV variant from
mother to child, but the ability of this variant to propagate among the
vaccinated children remains unknown.
