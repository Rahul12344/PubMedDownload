BACKGROUND: Liver disease in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection ranges
from minimal lesions to liver cirrhosis, eventually evolving to hepatocellular
carcinoma. Whether and how HCV determines the different clinical and histological
manifestations of the disease is not fully understood.
AIMS: To verify whether the amount of virus in individual patients could be
related to the severity of liver injury.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Levels of HCV RNA were measured in serum in 96 consecutive 
patients with chronic hepatitis type C using a signal amplification assay. The
relation between viraemic values and the corresponding viral load in the liver
was assessed in a subgroup of 21 patients in whom HCV RNA was measured in serum
samples and liver specimens obtained at the same time.
RESULTS: A positive correlation was observed between the amount of viral nucleic 
acid in the two compartments, indicating that levels of viraemia reflect the
amount of virus present in the liver. Viral load did not correlate with
aminotransferase activities nor with histological diagnosis, and serum and liver 
levels of HCV RNA were not significantly different in patients infected by the
various HCV genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of HCV replication in serum is a mirror of viral
replication in the liver. The extent of replicative activity of HCV does not seem
to play a role in the modulation of the associated hepatic disease.
