BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E is a major health problem in developing countries
including India. The incidence and mortality rate in pregnant women with
fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been reported 
to be significantly higher, specifically in Asian women. Pregnancy is usually
associated with an altered status of sex steroid hormones and immunity. Steroid
hormones directly influence the replication through their effects on viral
regulatory elements. Moreover, pregnant women in Asia generally suffer from
folate deficiency, which is known to cause reduced immunocompetence leading to
greater risk of multiple viral infections and higher viral load.
OBJECTIVES: To correlate and analyze the viral load and genotypes of HEV in acute
liver failure with that of acute viral hepatitis among pregnant and nonpregnant
women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 FHF and 150 acute viral hepatitis (AVH)
patients (50, 75 pregnant and 50, 75 nonpregnant, respectively), were included in
the study. These cases were evaluated on the basis of history, clinical
examination, liver function profile, and serological test of hepatitis A, B, C,
and E using commercially available ELISA kits. Quantification of HEV RNA-positive
samples was carried out.
RESULTS: Out of 100 FHF and 150 acute viral hepatitis (AVH) patients, 28 (56%)
and 22 (29.3%) pregnant and 7 (14%) and 8 (16%) nonpregnant, respectively, were
HEV RNA-positive. HEV viral load in FHF pregnant women was 5.87 x 10(4)+/- 1.5 x 
10(5) microL/mL as compared to AVH pregnant women 343.29 +/- 216.44 microL/mL and
FHF and AVH nonpregnant 199.2 +/- 225.5 microL/mL and 13.83 +/- 7.8 microL/mL,
respectively. Sequencing data of all the positive samples of FHF and AVH pregnant
and nonpregnant women showed genotype 1.
CONCLUSION: HEV viral load was found to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) in
pregnant patients compared to the nonpregnant. Pregnancy appears to be a risk
factor for viral replication. The viral copies of HEV in FHF pregnant women were 
comparatively higher when compared to AVH pregnant women, which may be related to
the severity of the disease in these patients. We could detect only one genotype 
(genotype 1) in our study population. Thus in the absence of other genotypes in
this population, the impact of genotype could not be adequately assessed in this 
study.
