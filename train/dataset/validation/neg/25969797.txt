Since Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was first identified in 1976 in what is now the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and despite the numerous outbreaks recorded to
date, rarely has an epidemic origin been identified. Indeed, among the twenty-one
most documented EVD outbreaks in Africa, an index case has been identified four
times, and hypothesized in only two other instances. The initial steps of
emergence and spread of a virus are critical in the development of a potential
outbreak and need to be thoroughly dissected and understood in order to improve
on preventative strategies. In the current West African outbreak of EVD, a unique
index case has been identified, pinpointing the geographical origin of the
epidemic in Guinea. Herein, we provide an accounting of events that serve as the 
footprint of EVD emergence in Sierra Leone and a road map for risk mitigation
fueled by lessons learned.
