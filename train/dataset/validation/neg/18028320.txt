BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although insulin resistance affects liver fibrosis
progression and treatment response in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), the relationship
between chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and insulin resistance (IR)
remains to be firmly established. We thus studied the impact of host, metabolic
and viral factors on IR in CHC patients.
METHODS: A total of 162 CHC patients with complete clinical data were enrolled.
Among them, 94 received histological examinations. Quantitative HCV RNA was
assayed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Genotyping was
performed by reverse transcription PCR with type-specific primers. The
pretreatment IR index was determined using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA),
and an index value of more than 2.4 was designated IR. Unadjusted and adjusted
association of the HCV RNA level and IR was further analysed.
RESULTS: In multivariate linear regression analysis, a dose-response relationship
was observed between the log(10) HCV RNA level and the presence of IR. IR was
positively correlated with body mass index, triglyceride, HCV RNA and alanine
aminotransferase levels, but negatively correlated with adiponectin level.
Subgroup analysis stratified by HCV genotype showed that there was a trend
towards a higher HOMR-IR index value and lower adiponectin levels in genotype 1
patients. Histological analysis showed that IR was positively associated with the
severity of hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that higher HCV RNA levels are associated with the
presence of IR in CHC patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the
interplays between HCV infection, IR and adiponectin in an attempt to develop new
adjuvant therapy for CHC.
