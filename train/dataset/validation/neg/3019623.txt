Prevalence of viral warts on the hands of retail butchers.

Buchet C, de la Brassinne M.

The prevalence of viral warts on the hands was found to be the same in a group of
113 workers in butcher's shops as in a control group of 115 mechanics. This low
prevalence is discussed and statistically compared to previous studies in the
literature.
