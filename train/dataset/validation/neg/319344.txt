Lambdoid phages that simplify the recovery of in vitro recombinants.

Murray NE, Brammar WJ, Murray K.

Derivatives of phage lambda are described for use as vectors for fragments of DNA
generated with the HindIII and EcoRI restriction enzymes. With some vectors,
hybrid molecules are recognised by a change from a turbid to a clear plaque
morphology resulting from the insertion of a fragment of DNA into the lambda gene
coding for the phage regressor. Other vectors contain a central, replaceable
fragment of DNA which imparts a readily recognisable phenotype. This central
fragment may include either a gene for a mutant transfer RNA (suppressor) or a
part of the lacZ gene of E. coli able to complement a lacZ host. The appropriate 
lacZ host and indicator plates permit the ready distinction between recombinant
and vector phages by the colour of the plaques.
