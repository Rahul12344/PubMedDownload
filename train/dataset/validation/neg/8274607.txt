In the 1980s, tens of thousands of cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) 
occurred in persons with AIDS, making it the most common opportunistic infection 
encountered in this patient population. Thus, the presentation and clinical
course of PCP became well-known to many physicians. Overshadowed by this epidemic
was the continued occurrence of PCP in persons not infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, most notably those receiving immunosuppressive therapy
for neoplastic disease or other indications. A review from Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has demonstrated that, in addition to those
patients previously defined as at risk--those with acute lymphocytic leukemia or 
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation--patients receiving corticosteroid therapy
for a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm are at risk for PCP and should receive
prophylaxis. Among patients with neoplastic disease, the disease may be more
fulminant and the mortality rate higher--approaching 50% in most series. Wider
use of prophylaxis should decrease the frequency of this disease, while prompt
initiation of therapy in patients with a compatible syndrome should help to lower
mortality rates.
