OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of Lamivudine on controlling
hepatitis B virus DNA replication.
METHODS: The liver disease patients were divided into two groups, the treated
group (n=64) was given Lamivudine 100 mg once a day for one year and was
additionally given liver protection drugs according to their liver function,
while the control group (n=30) was given common liver protection drugs. The blood
routine test, liver function and the viral markers were detected at defined
times.
RESULTS: The results showed that after one year treatment of chronic hepatitis B 
with Lamivudine, the recovery rate of ALT was 90.7%, the negative conversion rate
of HBV DNA was 73.1% showing a significant difference as compared with the
control group (P<0.05). The negative seroconversion rate of HBeAg was 50%,
HBeAg/anti HBe changing rate was 38.2%, that had no significant different as
compared with the control group (P<0.05). The percentage for disease relapse and 
second elevation of ALT was 3.1% in therapeutic group that was significantly
different from that of the control group (P<0.05). Two cases with severe
hepatitis in the treated group were all alive.
CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine could effectively control HBV DNA replication, making ALT
normal, it also could decrease the relapse rate of chronic hepatitis B and raise 
the survival rate of the patients with liver disease.
