The resolution of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is dramatically affected by
the number and configuration of the electrodes used, because these alter the
shape of the applied electrical fields. Here we present calculations and
experiments on the effect of electrode position in one of the most commonly used 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis configurations. The goal was to explore which
aspects of the electrical field shape correlate with improved electrophoretic
resolution. The most critical variable appears to be the angle between the
alternate electrical fields. The most effective electrode configurations yield
angles of more than 110 degrees. A continually increasing angle between the
fields produces band sharpening that greatly enhances the resolution.
