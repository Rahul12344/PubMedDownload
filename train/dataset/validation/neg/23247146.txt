Respiratory viral infections in infants and young children frequently cause
illness that can easily progress to hospitalization and death. There are
currently no licensed vaccines to prevent respiratory viral disease in children
younger than 6 months, reflecting safety concerns and the difficulty in inducing 
effective immune responses in infants. This review discusses vaccines that have
been developed, or are currently being developed, against influenza and
respiratory syncytial virus, with a focus on studies performed to demonstrate
their safety and efficacy, and the impact of immunologic immaturity and maternal 
antibodies on the infant response to vaccines.
