Temperature-dependent formation of dimers and oligomers of mitochondrial DNA in
cells transformed by a thermosensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus.

Nass MM.

In chick-embryo fibroblasts infected by T5, a temperature-sensitive mutant of
Schmidt-Ruppin Rous sarcoma virus, the level of catenated dimeric and oligomeric 
mitochondrial DNA is temperature-dependent and correlates with the phenotypic
manifestation of transformation. At the permissive temperature (36 degrees ),
where transformation is expressed, the 2- to 3-fold elevated level characteristic
of cells transformed by the wild-type Rous sarcoma virus was observed, but at the
nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees ), at which cells appear normal and behave 
normally, the oligomer level was characteristic of uninfected cells. Temperature 
shifts from 41 to 36 degrees and vice versa resulted in phenotypic reversion and 
reversals of the respective levels of multiple-length DNA. Cellular growth rates 
were not altered. Treatment of control cells with cycloheximide resulted in a
5-fold increase of oligomeric DNA, whereas exposure to
9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine had little effect. With both inhibitors, nuclear
but not mitochondrial DNA synthesis was inhibited. The possible relation of
formation of oligomeric mitochondrial DNA to alterations in the mitochondrial
membranes of transformed cells and to inhibition of protein synthesis in the
cytoplasm is discussed.
