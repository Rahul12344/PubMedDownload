Pigs are thought to be the most suitable donor animal for xenotransplantation.
However, pigs harbour potentially hazardous infectious agents, termed porcine
endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), in their genome. In this study, we generated a
mAb against PERV-B surface (SU) envelope protein (Env), designated KRT1. KRT1
binding was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometric 
analysis on cells infected with PERV-B. KRT1 neutralized PERV-B pseudotype virus 
and specifically recognized PERV-B SU Env, but not PERV-A SU Env by
immunoblotting analysis. The peptide-ELISA revealed that KRT1 recognized a linear
peptide sequence (ALEPPHNLPVP) residing in a proline-rich region that is one of
the subdomains of SU Env. In conclusion, the KRT1 antibody will serve as a useful
tool for the study of PERV-B and, more importantly, it may provide new protective
strategies against PERV-B infection in xenotransplantation.
