Plaque assays for titrating dengue virus (DENV) are time-consuming and not
suitable for strains that do not plaque. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) has been used to detect DENV-infected cells. Here we describe a FACS-based
assay for titrating DENV. We determined that at 24 h postinfection, the number of
infected cells detected by FACS represented the first round of infection and
therefore could be used as a readout of the number of infectious particles in the
inoculum. When the titers of different laboratory and clinical strains of DENV
were compared using FACS, plaque, and endpoint dilution assays, for most strains 
the FACS titers were comparable to titers obtained by plaque or endpoint dilution
assays. The FACS assay is an improvement over the plaque assay because the
infection period is reduced from 5 to 7 days to 24 h and the assay can be used to
titrate clinical isolates that frequently do not form clear plaques on cell
monolayers. The novel FACS-based methods described here will facilitate
laboratory studies of dengue.
