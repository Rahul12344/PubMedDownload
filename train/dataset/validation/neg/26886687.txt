OBJECTIVES: To analyse the subgroup of early arthritis patients with new onset
parvovirus infections for details that may help narrow the population tested.
METHODS: From their routine patient charts, patient histories and clinical and
serological data were obtained for all 130 patients of the Rheumatology division 
with parvovirus serology performed. 11 patients had acute parvovirus infections, 
defined by specific IgM antibodies. 95 patients had a previous infection, 16 were
never infected, together forming the n=111 control group, and 8 patients had to
be excluded.
RESULTS: Most patients with acute parvovirus infection had an acute onset, highly
symmetrical polyarthritis of small joints, which was preceded by prodromal
symptoms. Positive ANA were frequently found, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP)
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were only mildly elevated. No frank
synovitis was found longer than two weeks after disease onset. Most patients were
free of symptoms within three months, and no patient in the parvovirus group
developed rheumatoid arthritis or a connective tissue disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Parvovirus serology may be helpful in patients with acute
polyarthritis of very recent onset, and if they give a history of prodromal
symptoms, in particular. In most instances, parvovirus arthritis is an acute
disease, which is rapidly self-limiting.
