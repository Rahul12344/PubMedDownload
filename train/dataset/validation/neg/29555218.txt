The global adoption of vaccines to combat disease is hampered by the high cost of
vaccine manufacturing. The work described herein follows two previous
publications (van der Sanden et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017) that report a
strategy to enhance poliovirus and rotavirus vaccine production through genetic
modification of the Vero cell lines used in large-scale vaccine manufacturing.
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tools were used to knockout Vero target genes previously
shown to play a role in polio- and rotavirus production. Subsequently,
small-scale models of current industry manufacturing systems were developed and
adopted to assess the increases in polio- and rotavirus output by multiple stable
knockout cell lines. Unlike previous studies, the Vero knockout cell lines failed
to achieve desired target yield increases. These findings suggest that additional
research will be required before implementing the genetically engineered Vero
cell lines in the manufacturing process for polio- and rotavirus vaccines to be
able to supply vaccines at reduced prices.
