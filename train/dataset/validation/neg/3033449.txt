Development of immunity to Epstein-Barr virus in Malaysian children.

Yadav MS, Malliga N, Ablashi DV.

The pattern of seroconversion to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was determined in 98
Malaysian children aged 2 weeks to 12 years. Maternal IgG antibodies to EBV viral
capsid antigen, ranging between 1:10 to 1:160 titer, were found in 70.6 percent
of infants less than three months old, and dropped to 26 percent by seven to nine
months. Primary infection, as denoted by emergence of EBV-IgM antibody, occurred 
at 4 to 6 months, and by eight years all children were seropositive. Maternal
antibody titers to EBV nuclear antigen were detected in 52.9 percent of infants
less than 3 months old, declined to undetectable levels by 4 to 12 months, and
then increased to 40 percent by the age of 12 years. The IgA antibody to viral
capsid antigen was absent in all but one infant aged one year; the child also had
IgG anti-early antigen, The IgG antibody to EBV early antigen were present in
17.7 percent of the infants aged 3 months or less. This seroconversion to EBV in 
early life explains the absence of infectious mononucleosis in the Malaysian
population. The data suggest that a subunit vaccine to protect against
EBV-associated diseases, most notably nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly observed
in Malaysians would have to be administered to infants 6-12 months of age.
