Oral lactoferrin supplementation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, 
antiretroviral therapy-naïve children resulted in a skewing of T-lymphocytes
towards more differentiated subpopulations. Phagocytosis (P=0.01) and killing
(P=0.009), Toll-like receptor 2 expression (P=0.01) and the
interleukin-12/interleukin-10 ratio (P=0.001) were also improved by lactoferrin. 
Lactoferrin supplementation results in immune modulation and could be useful in
HIV infection.
