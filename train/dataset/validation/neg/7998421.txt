The canarypox (CP) and fowlpox (FP) viruses, which are unable to replicate
productively in non-avian species, have been utilized as live vectors carrying
the HIV-1SF2 env gene with the putative immunosuppressive (IS) region complete
(CPIS+ and FPIS+) or deleted (CPIS- and FPIS-). To determine if these avipox-env 
recombinants could be utilized to elicit a specific immune response against
HIV-1, six groups of rabbits were immunized with CPIS+, CPIS-, FPIS+, FPIS-
constructs or their non-engineered wild-type CPwt or FPwt counterparts. After a
primary inoculation and successive boosters, env-specific humoral and
cell-mediated immunity were demonstrated by ELISA, immunoblots and
lymphoproliferation assays. Antibody titres and neutralization activities were
higher in CP- than FP-inoculated rabbits, the CPIS+ always showing a similar
immunogenic capacity to CPIS-. Evidence is also presented indicating that rabbit 
sera possess group-specific antibodies, which were, however, unable to
cross-neutralize divergent HIV-1 strains. Although the protective capacity
against HIV-1 experimental infection has not yet been determined in these
animals, our results suggest that these recombinants might represent promising
and safer candidate vaccines against HIV-1.
