The infection of CD4 cells may have significant involvement in the transmission
and long-term persistency of HIV. Using HIV clones carrying the enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP), we infected epithelial and glioneuronal cell lines
derived from the female reproductive tract, brain, colon, and intestine. HIV
infection was quantified by counting EGFP-positive cells. Infection was
quantified in cell lines from the female reproductive tract, brain tissue, and
colon tissue (0.36%-3.15%). Virus replicated in the infected cells and the
progeny virus were infectious for CD4 cells, HeLa-CD4, and CEM T lymphocytes.
Furthermore, we found that infection of these epithelial and brain cell lines is 
independent of gp120. The results from the infection of CD4 epithelial cells
suggest that HIV can traverse epithelial cell layers by infecting them through a 
gp120-independent mechanism. Infection of glial and neuronal cell lines suggests 
that HIV infection of these cells is a probable mechanism for HIV pathogenicity
in the brain and a possible cause for persistent infection in patients.
