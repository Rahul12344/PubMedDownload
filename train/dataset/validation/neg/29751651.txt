Clostridium perfringens is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness.
The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria requires the
development of alternatives to typical antimicrobial treatments. Here, we
isolated and characterized a C. perfringens-specific virulent bacteriophage CPS2 
from chicken feces. The CPS2 phage contains a 17,961 bp double-stranded DNA
genome with 25 putative ORFs, and belongs to the Picovirinae, subfamily of
Podoviridae. Bioinformatic analysis of the CPS2 genome revealed a putative
endolysin, LysCPS2, which is homologous to the endolysin of Clostridium phage
phiZP2 and phiCP7R. The enzyme showed strong lytic activity against C.
perfringens with optimum conditions at pH 7.5⁻10, 25⁻65 °C, and over a broad
range of NaCl concentrations. Interestingly, LysCPS2 was found to be highly
thermostable, with up to 30% of its lytic activity remaining after 10 min of
incubation at 95 °C. The cell wall binding domain in the C-terminal region of
LysCPS2 showed a binding spectrum specific to C. perfringens strains. This is the
first report to characterize highly thermostable endolysin isolated from virulent
C. perfringens bacteriophage. The enzyme can be used as an alternative biocontrol
and detection agent against C. perfringens.
