Central European encephalitis is the most common arthropod-borne virus disease in
the Czech Republic, with the mean annual incidence of 6 cases per 100 000
population. However, seven less known arboviruses (Flavivirus West Nile,
Bunyavirus Tahyna, Bunyavirus Batai, Bunyavirus Sedlec, Bunyavirus Lednice,
Orbivirus Tribee, Uukuvirus Uukuniemi) also circulate in this country, of which
West Nile, Tahyna, Tribec and possibly Batai have been reported to cause human
disease. Moreover, antibodies against two other pathogenic viruses found in
Europe, i.e. Alphavirus Sindbis and Coltivirus Eyach, have been detected in the
Czech Republic. The aim of this study is to review briefly the less known
arboviruses found in the Czech Republic with emphasis on the taxonomic status,
identification of their hosts and vectors, and pathogenicity to humans. These
arboviruses can cause febrile illness to aseptic (meningo)encephalitis of unclear
etiology. The review points out the possible emergence of these neglected
arboviruses in the foreseeable future and provides diagnostic guidance.
