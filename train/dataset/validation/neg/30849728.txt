In the study, we describe an oscillatory flow-assisted efficient target
enrichment method by using a particle-based microarray device. Periodic
oscillating flow effectively increased the mixing and binding performance between
the target molecules in the sample solution and surface functionalized
microparticles. Particles were trapped, secured, and released with an elastic
microvalve structure operated via differences in the flow conditions. Single
particle (20-µm diameter) trapping efficiency exceeded 95%. Secured particles can
freely move inside each array element based on oscillating sample flow.
Furthermore, the particles can be released from the array and collected at the
outlet of the device, and this provides an opportunity for further off-chip
analysis. As a proof-of-concept, we used the interaction between
streptavidin-coated microparticles and fluorescence labeled biotin solution and
demonstrated that target enrichment and detection based on oscillatory flow were 
significantly more efficient than that based on unidirectional or static flow.
The applicability of the method was further examined by conducting an on-chip
immunoassay to detect the presence of anti-Zika nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)
monoclonal antibody. The limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 1 ng/mL with an
assay time of only 10 min and less than 10 µL of sample consumption.
