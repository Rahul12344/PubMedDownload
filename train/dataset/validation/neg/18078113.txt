The aim of this study was to examine whether Staphylococcus aureus of phage type 
187 are genetically homogenous with the use of digestion of chromosomal DNA with 
SmaI and separation of the DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Sixteen S. aureus phage type 187 were isolated from the hospital patients (12)
and the healthy carriers (4) in twelve medical centres in Poland during 1991 and 
2005. The PFGE typing proved that the phage type 187 isolates have the same PFGE 
type (except for one) and constitute one clone.
