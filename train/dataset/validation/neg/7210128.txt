Aedes albopictus in the Solomon and Santa Cruz Islands, South Pacific.

Elliott SA.

Surveys of mosquitoes in the South Pacific up until 1977 have shown the presence 
of Aedes albopictus only as far east as Papua New Guinea. During the visit to the
Solomon Islands in 1978 to collect members of the Aedes (Stegomyia) scutellaris
complex, Ae. albopictus was found in large numbers on Guadalcanal and was also
present in the Santa Cruz Islands. This species has been incriminated as a vector
of dengue haemorrhagic fever.
