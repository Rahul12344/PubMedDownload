There are still many unanswered questions in the pathogenesis of rabies, but
recent progress has been made. During most of the long incubation period of
rabies, the virus likely remains close the site of viral entry. Centripetal
spread to the central nervous system and spread within the central nervous system
occur by fast axonal transport. Neuronal dysfunction, rather than neuronal death,
is responsible for the clinical features and fatal outcome in natural rabies.
Recent work has changed our perspective on the ecology of rabies virus under
particular circumstances in certain species. Hopefully, advances in our
understanding of rabies pathogenesis will lead to advances in the treatment of
this dreaded disease.
