Comparison of methods for removal of nonspecific inhibitors of arbovirus
hemagglutination.

Human sera were treated with kaolin, acetone, and dextran sulfate to determine
the best method for removing nonspecific hemagglutination inhibitors. Results
indicated that on surveys for group A, group B, and some group C arbovirus HI
antibodies, dextran sulfate treatment of sera could be used effectively. This
method, however, has limited usefulness for detecting HI antibody for a number of
arboviruses, particularly some members of the Bunyamwera supergroup since
nonspecific inhibitors for these antigens were not completely removed. HI
antibodies in sera drawn early after dengue and Venezuelan equine encephalitis
infection were detected more readily after dextran sulfate treatment than after
kaolin treatment. Kaolin, but not dextran sulfate, was shown to remove antibody
from IgM fractions of sera.
