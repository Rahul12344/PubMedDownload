Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is regarded as a risk factor for
hepatocellular cancer, mostly in patients with liver cirrhosis. We looked for HCV
genomes in the livers of patients with hepatocellular cancer who did not have
cirrhosis to see whether HCV was directly oncogenic. Cancerous and non-cancerous 
liver tissue, and serum samples from 19 patients negative for hepatitis B surface
antigen were analysed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of HCV
genome, HCV replication, HCV genotyping, and HBV genome. 13 of 19 patients were
HCV RNA-positive in cancerous and non-cancerous liver tissue; 8 of 17 tested were
anti-HCV positive. Among the 13 HCV RNA-positive patients, 11 had genotype 1b and
2 had genotype 2a. 7 of 13 serum samples were HCV RNA positive. 7 of 19 patients 
were HBV DNA positive in cancerous and non-cancerous liver tissue, 5 of them
anti-HBc positive. 4 patients were both HCV RNA and HBV DNA positive and 3 were
both HCV RNA and HBV DNA negative. Our results provide evidence for the
association of HCV, mostly genotype 1b, with hepatocellular cancer without the
intermediate step of cirrhosis.
