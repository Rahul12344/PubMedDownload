The human tumor suppressor SMARCB1/INI1/SNF5/BAF47 (SNF5) is a core subunit of
the multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, also known 
as Brahma/Brahma-related gene 1 (BRM/BRG1)-associated factor (BAF). Experimental 
studies of SWI/SNF are currently considerably limited by the low cellular
abundance of this complex; thus, recombinant protein production represents a key 
to obtain the SWI/SNF proteins for molecular and structural studies. While the
expression of mammalian proteins in bacteria is often difficult, the
baculovirus/insect cell expression system can overcome limitations of prokaryotic
expression systems and facilitate the co-expression of multiple proteins. Here,
we demonstrate that human full-length SNF5 tagged with a C-terminal 3 × FLAG can 
be expressed and purified from insect cell extracts in monomeric and dimeric
forms. To this end, we constructed a set of donor and acceptor vectors for the
expression of individual proteins and protein complexes in the baculovirus/insect
cell expression system under the control of a polyhedrin (polh), p10, or a
minimal Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70 promoter. We show that the SNF5 expression 
level could be modulated by the selection of the promoter used to control
expression. The vector set also comprises vectors that encode a 3 × FLAG tag,
Twin-Strep tag, or CBP-3 × FLAG-TEV-ProteinA triple tag to facilitate affinity
selection and detection. By gel filtration and split-ubiquitin assays, we show
that human full-length SNF5 has the ability to self-interact. Overall, the
toolbox developed herein offers the possibility to flexibly select the promoter
strength as well as the affinity tag and is suggested to advance the recombinant 
expression of chromatin remodeling factors and other challenging proteins.
