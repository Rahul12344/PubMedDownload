We present the sequence of an open reading frame (ORF) at the 3' end of human
astrovirus serotype 1. Primer extension experiments showed that the RNA
expressing this gene is shorter than the complete ORF, and could form a protein
of M(r) 85,540. The protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus and was
recognized by anti-virion serum, indicating a structural role. Sequence
comparison indicates that astrovirus serotypes 1 and 2 differ markedly in the
C-terminal half of the protein but are well conserved towards the N-terminus.
