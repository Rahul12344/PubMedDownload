Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, slowly progressing but
invariably fatal disease that is related to a prior measles virus infection and
most commonly affects paediatric patients. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the
modality of choice for determining such changes in white matter. SSPE typically
demonstrates bilateral but asymmetric periventricular and subcortical white
matter involvement. We herein report a rare case of unilateral white matter
involvement in a 13-year-old boy with SSPE that closely simulated Rasmussen's
encephalitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an
atypical presentation on MR imaging in which SSPE was a rare cause of unilateral 
brain parenchymal involvement in a patient with intractable seizures.
