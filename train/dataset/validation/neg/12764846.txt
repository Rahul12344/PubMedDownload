OBJECTIVE: To observe the presence of Epstin-Barr virus (EBV) and expression of
P53 and P16 in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) occurring in the nasal cavity and
pharyngeal Waldeyer's ring.
METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to detect EBV-DNA and P16-mRNA and
immunohistochemical staining was used to examine the expression of LMP1, P53 and 
P16 in the 36 cases. Five cases whose EBV-DNA were negative at first assay by
hybridization was re-detected for EBV-DNA by PCR.
RESULTS: Positive expression rates of EBV-DNA, LMP1, P16 mRNA, P53 and P16 were
63.9%, 27.8%, 30.6%, 19.4% and 22.2%. P53 and P16 expressions were not
significantly different between T cell NHL and B cell NHL, nor were them
significantly different between EBV positive and negative cases.
CONCLUSION: A higher percentage of EBV infection was detected in the nasal cavity
and pharyngeal Waldeyer's ring in NHL. EBV infection was not significantly
associated with P53 and P16 expresions in NHL.
