Amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the major structural polypeptides of avian 
retroviruses: sequence homology between reticuloendotheliosis virus p30 and p30s 
of mammalian retroviruses.

Hunter E, Bhown AS, Bennett JC.

The major structural polypeptides, p30 of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV)
(strain T) and p27 of avian sarcoma virus B77, have been compared with regard to 
amino acid composition. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and immunological
crossreactions. The amino acid composition of the two polypeptides is distinct,
and a comparison of the first 30 NH2-terminal amino acids of REV p30 with that
for the first 25 of B77 p27 yields only three homologous residues. In competition
radioimmunoassays the polypeptides show no crossreactivity. A comparison of the
amino acid composition and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of REV p30 with those
reported for several mammalian retrovirus p30s shows remarkable similarities.
Both REV and mammalian p30s contain a large number of polar residues in their
amino acid composition and show approximately 40% homology in the first 30
NH2-terminal amino acids. No crossreactivity could be observed, however, in
competition radioimmunoassays between Rauscher murine leukemia virus p30 and that
of REV. The observations reported here suggest a close evolutionary relationship 
between REV and the mammalian retroviruses.
