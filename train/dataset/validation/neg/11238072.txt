MOTIVATION: The recent rapid rise in the availability of whole genome DNA
sequence data has led to bottlenecks in their complete analysis. Specifically,
there is a need for software tools that will allow mining of gene and putative
gene data at a whole genome level. These new tools will complement the current
set already in use for studying specific aspects of individual genes and putative
genes in detail. A key software challenge is to make them user-friendly, without 
losing their flexibility and capability for use in research.
RESULTS: The creation of GeneOrder-a web-based interactive, computational
tool-allows researchers to compare the order of genes in two genomes. It has been
tested on full genome sequence data for viruses, mitochondria and chloroplasts
that were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. It is accessible at
http://www.bif.atcc.org/GENEOrder/index.html. GeneOrder prepares the comparison
in table form, listing the order of similar genes. Hyperlinks are provided from
this output; these lead to the 'Protein Coding Regions' in the NCBI database.
