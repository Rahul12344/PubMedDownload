OBJECTIVE: The in situ reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced
cardiomyocytes by the administration of gene transfer vectors encoding Gata4 (G),
Mef2c (M), and Tbx5 (T) has been shown to improve ventricular function in
myocardial infarction models. The efficacy of this strategy could, however, be
limited by the need for fibroblast targets to be infected 3 times--once by each
of the 3 transgene vectors. We hypothesized that a polycistronic "triplet" vector
encoding all 3 transgenes would enhance postinfarct ventricular function compared
with use of "singlet" vectors.
METHODS: After validation of the polycistronic vector expression in vitro, adult 
male Fischer 344 rats (n=6) underwent coronary ligation with or without
intramyocardial administration of an adenovirus encoding all 3 major vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms (AdVEGF-All6A positive), followed 3
weeks later by the administration to AdVEGF-All6A-positive treated rats of
singlet lentivirus encoding G, M, or T (1×10(5) transducing units each) or the
same total dose of a GMT "triplet" lentivirus vector.
RESULTS: Western blots demonstrated that triplet and singlet vectors yielded
equivalent GMT transgene expression, and fluorescence activated cell sorting
demonstrated that triplet vectors were nearly twice as potent as singlet vectors 
in generating induced cardiomyocytes from cardiac fibroblasts. Echocardiography
demonstrated that GMT triplet vectors were more effective than the 3 combined
singlet vectors in enhancing ventricular function from postinfarct baselines
(triplet, 37%±10%; singlet, 13%±7%; negative control, 9%±5%; P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These data have confirmed that the in situ administration of G, M,
and T induces postinfarct ventricular functional improvement and that GMT
polycistronic vectors enhance the efficacy of this strategy.
