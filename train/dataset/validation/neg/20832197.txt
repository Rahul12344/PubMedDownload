BACKGROUND: Despite the value of 12-step meetings, few studies have examined
factors associated with attendance among those living with HIV/AIDS, such as the 
impact of HIV disease severity and demographics.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines predisposing characteristics, enabling resources
and need on attendance at Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA)
meetings among those living with HIV/AIDS and alcohol problems.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of prospective data from the HIV-Longitudinal
Interrelationships of Viruses and Ethanol study, a cohort of 400 adults living
with HIV/AIDS and alcohol problems. Factors associated with AA/NA attendance were
identified using the Anderson model for vulnerable populations. Generalized
estimating equation logistic regression models were fit to identify factors
associated with self-reported AA/NA attendance.
RESULTS: At study entry, subjects were 75% male, 12% met diagnostic criteria for 
alcohol dependence, 43% had drug dependence and 56% reported attending one or
more AA/NA meetings (past 6 months). In the adjusted model, female gender
negatively associated with attendance, as were social support systems that use
alcohol and/or drugs, while presence of HCV antibody, drug dependence diagnosis, 
and homelessness associated with higher odds of attendance.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-substance abuse related barriers to AA/NA group attendance exist
for those living with HIV/AIDS, including females and social support systems that
use alcohol and/or drugs. Positive associations of homelessness, HCV infection
and current drug dependence were identified. These findings provide implications 
for policy makers and treatment professionals who wish to encourage attendance at
12-step meetings for those living with HIV/AIDS and alcohol or other substance
use problems.
