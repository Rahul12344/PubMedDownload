A local strain of goat pox virus was tested in goats and sheep. The results
showed that 65% of goats and 20% of sheep reacted positively. Only goats died few
days after the inoculation (55%) and no mortality was recorded in the sheep. The 
strict species specificity of this strain was not observed. The difference of
sensitivity between sheep and goats was statistically significant.
