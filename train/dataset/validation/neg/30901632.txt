Males/men and females/women differ in the outcome of influenza A virus (IAV)
infections, vaccination, and antiviral treatments. Both sex (i.e. biological
factors) and gender (i.e. sociocultural factors) can impact exposure and severity
of IAV infections as well as responses and outcomes of treatments for IAV.
Greater consideration of the combined effects of sex and gender in
epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies of influenza pathogenesis is
needed.
