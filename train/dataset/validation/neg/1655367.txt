420 cases of condyloma acuminata and condyloma-like lesions in vulvar region in
Guangzhou area were studies on paraffin sections: detection of capsid antigen of 
human papilloma-versus (HPV-Ag) and observation of microscopic morphology. Of the
420 cases, 160 cases (38.1%) were diagnosed condyloma acuminata. In which,
diagnostic koilocytes can be found in 156 cases (97.5%) and HPV-Ag were positive 
in 105 cases (65.6%). 260 cases (61.9%) were diagnosed chronic inflammation of
the skin or mucosa and were all negative for HPV-Ag, koilocyte-like cells but
diagnostic koilocytes presented in these lesions. In this paper, morphological
features of diagnostic koilocytes and koilocyte-like cells were detailed, and
histological and gross distinction between condyloma and condyloma-like lesions
were described.
