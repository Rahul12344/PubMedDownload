Comparative studies of sequence motifs in the RNA polymerases and nucleic acid
helicases of positive-sense RNA plant viruses have provided a new scheme for the 
classification of these pathogens. We propose a new luteovirus supergroup which
should be added to the already described Sindbisvirus-like and picornavirus-like 
supergroups. Sequence motifs of nucleic acid helicases and RNA polymerases which 
previously were considered to be specific for each of the two supergroups now
occur together within this new supergroup. We propose that this new viral
supergroup provides an evolutionary link between the other two supergroups.
