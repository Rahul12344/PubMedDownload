Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive skin malignancy. The growing
incidence and recognition of this cancer in elderly or immunosuppressed
individuals suggests that it is becoming an increasing clinical challenge. MCC
recently has been demonstrated to have a probable viral pathogenesis related to a
novel member of the polyomavirus (termed Merkel cell polyomavirus [MCV]). The
molecular pathogenesis of viral carcinogenesis is currently being worked out in
MCC. Current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are discussed, with an eye
toward the future development of molecularly targeted treatments.
