SUMOylation of viral proteins is widespread and serves to modify or regulate the 
properties of those proteins. Papillomaviruses are a large group of small DNA
viruses that infect the skin, leading to benign lesions (warts) that in some
cases can progress to malignancy. The papillomavirus life cycle is intimately
connected with the differentiation process of stratified epithelium, and several 
viral early proteins function to modulate the host cell environment. One of the
critical early proteins is the E2 protein, which functions in both viral
replication and transcription. In the present paper, we demonstrate that E2
proteins are SUMOylated and that overexpression of SUMOylation results in a
dramatic increase in intracellular levels of the E2 protein. We have shown
previously that there is increased SUMOylation during keratinocyte
differentiation, suggesting that the levels of E2 protein may be tied to changes 
in the cellular SUMOylation state during differentiation. In addition to itself
being regulated by SUMOylation, E2 appears to influence the SUMOylation state of 
one of its binding partners, the cellular transcription factor, C/EBP
(CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein). Overall, these observations indicate a complex 
interplay between this viral protein and the host SUMOylation system.
