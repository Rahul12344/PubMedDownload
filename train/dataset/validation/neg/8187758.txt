Anti-FRP mAbs induced polykaryocyte formation of U2ME-7 cells (CD4+U937 cells
transfected with the HIV gp160 gene). Anti-FRP-1 mAb immunoprecipitated gp80-85, 
gp120 and homodimers of these peptides, and anti-FRP-2 mAb reacted with gp135
identically to the alpha 3 subunit of integrin. Both anti-FRP-1 and anti-FRP-2
mAb-induced cell fusion was blocked by anti-beta 1 integrin antibody, fibronectin
or inhibiting anti-FRP-1 antibody. Therefore, anti-FRP mAbs were thought to
induce the fusion via an integrin system(s). FRP-mediated fusion was temperature,
cytoskeleton, energy and Ca2+ dependent. These experiments showed a possible
regulatory function of cell fusion by an integrin system(s).
