In 2013, 80,000 new cases of infection caused by human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) (HIV infection) were registered in Russia; there have been a total of as
many as 850,000 notified HIV-infected cases in this country, which suggests that 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic becomes generalized. Of them, 150,000 people have died,
most (22,000) cases in 2013, predominantly due to the late diagnosis of HIV
infection and its delayed treatment initiation. The rise of new cases denotes
that counteraction against the spread of HIV is inadequately effective; in this
connection a further increase in morbidity and mortality rates should be
forthcoming. However, the medical community has proved to be poorly trained to
fight the epidemic; there is a lower awareness and knowledge about HIV infection 
among healthcare workers. To overcome the epidemic and its imminent negative
implications, it is necessary to improve an epidemiological surveillance system, 
to introduce proven effective methods for the prevention of the disease, to
increase patient access to current treatments, which will require not only higher
direct expenditures on preventive measures, the creation of an infrastructure,
and the purchase of medicaments and diagnostic agents, but also on the training
and retraining of a large number of healthcare workers.
