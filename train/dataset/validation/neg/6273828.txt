Nucleotide requirements for DNA replication of SV40 chromatin in
digitonin-treated and saponin-treated permeable cells.

Oda T, Watanabe S, Maki Y, Iwamoto H.

Permeable cell systems have been developed by treatment with digitonin or saponin
for studying in vitro DNA replication of chromatin. DNA replication of SV40
nucleoprotein complexes (SV40 chromatin) in these systems requires the addition
of ATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and Mg2+. Further addition of three other
ribonucleoside triphosphates slightly increased DNA synthesis. Omission of ATP
greatly reduced DNA synthesis. In the presence of ATP, however, omission of dATP 
did not significantly alter or rather slightly enhanced DNA synthesis. Analysis
of replicated SV40 DNA by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicated that 
complete replication of SV40 DNA and chromatin occurred in these systems
