We had previously reported that REIC/Dkk-3, a member of the Dickkopf (Dkk) gene
family, works as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic 
effects of an intratumoral injection with adenoviral vector encoding REIC/Dkk-3
gene (Ad-REIC) using an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model of RM-9 cells. We 
also investigated the in vivo anti-metastatic effect and in vitro anti-invasion
effect of Ad-REIC gene delivery. We demonstrated that the Ad-REIC treatment
inhibited prostate cancer growth and lymph node metastasis, and prolonged mice
survival in the model. These therapeutic responses were consistent with the
intratumoral apoptosis induction and in vitro suppression of cell
invasion/migration with reduced matrix metalloprotease-2 activity. We thus
concluded that in situ Ad-REIC/Dkk-3 gene transfer may be a promising therapeutic
intervention modality for the treatment of prostate cancer.
