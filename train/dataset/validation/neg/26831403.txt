OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the adiponectin-encoding gene ADIPOQ and changes in serum
lipid levels in HIV-1-infected patients after antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: ART-naïve HIV-1-infected patients were recruited to this prospective
analysis. SNP +45 and SNP +276 genotype was determined by direct sequencing.
Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to analyse the effects of
genotype, and predisposing conditions on serum total cholesterol and triglyceride
in the 4 months before and after ART initiation.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 78 patients with HIV-1-infection (73 male, five
female; age range 22-67 years). HIV-1 viral load ≥5 log10 copies/ml, baseline
total cholesterol ≥160 mg/dl, and CD4(+) lymphocyte count <200/µl were associated
with increased serum total cholesterol levels after ART initiation. Protease
inhibitor treatment and body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2) were associated with
increased triglyceride levels after ART initiation. There were no significant
associations between SNP +45 or SNP +276 genotype and serum total cholesterol or 
triglyceride levels.
CONCLUSIONS: SNP +45 and SNP +276 genotype is not associated with changes in
serum total cholesterol or triglyceride levels after ART initiation.
