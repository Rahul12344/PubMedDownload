Molecular species of interferon induced in mouse L cells by Newcastle disease
virus and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid.

Erickson JS, Paucker K.

Interferons were stimulated in mouse L cells by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or 
by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid poly(rI).poly(rC). These were
fractionated by sequential affinity chromatography on bovine plasma albumin
(BPA)-Sepharose and on omega-carboxypentyl (CH)-Sepharose. Based on their
interaction with CH-Sepharose, interferon induced by NDV was resolved into three 
major bands of activity (L/NDV-1,2,3) and poly(rI).poly(rC)-interferon into two
(L/rI:rC-1,2). These interferon components were purified to a specific activity
of 3 X 10(7) to 4 X 10(7) units/mg protein by antibody affinity chromatography
and examined by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A total of five
molecular species was thus identified for NDV-induced interferon and three for
poly(rI).poly(rC) induced interferon, as summarized in Table 1. We conclude from 
our observations that mouse interferons can be produced by L cells in multiple
forms with specific physiochemical properties and in proportions determined by
the type of agent employed for induction.
