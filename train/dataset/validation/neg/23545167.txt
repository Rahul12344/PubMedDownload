Site-specific recombinases (SSRs) have been crucial in the development of
mammalian transgenesis. For gene therapy purposes, this approach remains
challenging, because, for example, SSR delivery is largely unresolved and SSR DNA
substrates must pre-exist in target cells. In this review, we discuss the
potential of His-hydrophobic-His (HUH) recombinases to overcome some of the
limitations of conventional SSRs. Members of the HUH protein family cleave
single-stranded (ss)DNA, but can mediate site-specific integration with the aid
of the host replication machinery. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep remains the
only known example to support site-specific integration in human cells, and AAV
is an excellent gene delivery vector that can be targeted to specific cells and
organelles. Bacterial protein TrwC catalyzes integration into human sequences and
can be delivered to human cells covalently linked to DNA, offering attractive new
features for targeted genome modification.
