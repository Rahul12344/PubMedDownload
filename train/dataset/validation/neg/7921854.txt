Sera of patients suffering from acute hepatitis, and different forms of chronic
hepatitis were found to be reactive to reagents prepared from the yellow fever
virus (YF) vaccine strain. Serum samples of 1974 patients were tested, and 133 of
them were positive. Hepatitis C virus specific antibodies were absent from the
majority of them. The frequency of antibodies to other flaviviruses (tick-borne
encephalitis, West Nile) and hepatitis B virus markers was similar to that
measured among the population in Hungary positive for any of the surrogate
markers of hepatitis infections. Results of both immunofluorescence tests, and
Western blots suggest that there is a non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis virus
circulating among the Hungarian population, which possesses antigenic
cross-reactivity with the yellow fever virus, but the identity to any of the
known flaviviruses could not be verified yet. No history of yellow fever
vaccination could be revealed in any of the patients included into this study.
The anamnestic data on previous transfusions or surgical operations can be
verified only in the case of the half of YFV-positive patients, nevertheless, the
sexual transmission seems to be very infrequent. Attempts are continued in order 
to detect the viral RNA using polymerase chain reaction, and clone cDNA sequences
for sequence analysis.
