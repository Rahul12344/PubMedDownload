Citrus yellow vein clearing virus is a newly accepted member of the genus
Mandarivirus in the family Alphaflexiviridae. The triple gene block proteins
(TGBp1, TGBp2 and TGBp3) encoded by plant viruses in this family function on
facilitating virus movement. However, the protein function of citrus yellow vein 
clearing virus (CYVCV) have never been explored. Here, we showed in both yeast
two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence (BiFC) assays that the coat protein
(CP), TGBp1 and TGBp2 of CYVCV are self-interacting. Its CP also interacts with
all three TGB proteins, and TGBp1 and TGBp2 interact with each other but not with
TGBp3. Furthermore, the viral CP colocalizes with TGBp1 and TGBp3 at the
plasmodesmata (PD) of epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, and TGBp1 
can translocate TGBp2 from granular-like structures embedded within ER networks
to the PD. The results suggest that these proteins could coexist at the PD of
epidermal cells of N. benthamiana. Using Agrobacterium infiltration-mediated RNA 
silencing assays, we show that CYVCV CP is a strong RNA silencing suppressor
(RSS) triggered by positive-sense green fluorescent protein (GFP) RNA. The
presented results provide insights for further revealing the mechanism of the
viral movement and suppression of RNA silencing.
