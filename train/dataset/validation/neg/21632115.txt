OBJECTIVE: To analyse the records of past influenza outbreaks to determine a
definition for pandemics.
METHODS: Analysis of publications of large outbreaks of influenza which have
occurred since 1889/90, and to match the results against the current definitions 
of an influenza pandemic.
RESULTS: According to the general understanding of a pandemic, nine outbreaks of 
influenza since 1889/90 satisfy the definition; however, for two of these,
occurring in 1900 and 1933, the data are limited. The special condition for an
influenza pandemic requires, in one definition, that the virus strain responsible
could not have arisen from the previous circulating strain by mutation; and in
the second, that the new strain be a different subtype to the previously
circulating strain. Both these restrictions deny pandemic status to two, and
possibly three, influenza outbreaks which were pandemics according to the more
general understanding of the term. These observations suggest that a
re-evaluation of the criteria which define influenza pandemics should be carried 
out.
CONCLUSION: The contradiction outlined above brings the previous definitions of
an influenza pandemic into question; however, this can be resolved by defining an
influenza pandemic by the following criteria. Thus, an influenza pandemic arises 
at a single, specific place and spreads rapidly to involve numerous countries.
The haemagglutinin (HA) of the emergent virus does not cross-react serologically 
with the previously dominant virus strain(s), and there is a significant lack of 
immunity in the population against the emergent virus. These three criteria are
interlinked and can be determined early to alert authorities who could respond
appropriately. Other criteria associated with pandemics are necessarily
retrospective, although important and valid. The implications of this definition 
are discussed.
