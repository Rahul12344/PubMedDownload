To enable the differential PCR detection of Andean potato latent virus (APLV) and
Andean potato mild mosaic virus (APMMV) strains, sense primers were designed that
correspond to regions directly upstream of the coat protein genes. Their
differentiating power was increased by A->C or T->C replacements in their
3'-terminal parts. Together with the broad-specificity antisense primer EM3,
primer AL-a-mod3C detected all APLV strains tested, but none of the APMMV
strains. Primer AM-a-mod4C yielded PCR products with all APMMV preparations, but 
also with some APLV preparations. Sequence analysis revealed that this was not
due to a lack of primer specificity, but to the sensitive detection of
contaminating APMMV in some of our APLV preparations.
