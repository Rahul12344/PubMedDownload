Vision-threatening viral retinitis are primarily caused by members of the
herpesvirus family. The biology and molecular characterization of herpesviruses, 
clinical presentations of retinopathies, pathology and pathogenesis including the
host responses, epidemiology and the laboratory methods of aetiological diagnosis
of these diseases are described. Clinical syndromes are acute retinal necrosis
(ARN), progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN), cytomegalovirus (CMV)
retinitis, multifocal choroiditis and serpiginous choroiditis besides other viral
retinopathies. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) retinitis is more common in
immunocompetent persons while varicella zoster virus (VZV) affects both
immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients equally. CMV retinitis is most
common among patients with AIDS. The currently employed laboratory methods of
antigen detection, virus isolation and antibody detection by enzyme linked
immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) have low sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) has increased the value of diagnosis due to its high clinical sensitivity
and absolute specificity in detection of herpesviruses in intraocular specimens.
