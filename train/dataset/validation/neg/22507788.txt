Current knowledge suggests that EBV, KSHV and HTLV-1 contribute to
lymphomagenesis by subverting the host-cell molecular signaling machinery to
deregulate cell growth and survival. Some signaling pathways that are affected by
these viruses are well characterized, such as the NF-kB pathway, which is
activated by these three viruses to promote cellular survival by inhibiting
apoptosis, thereby playing a critical role in tumorigenesis. Other pathways, such
as MTOR and JAK-STAT are also likely involved in viral lymphomagenesis. This
provides the opportunity to inhibit these cellular pathways using drugs developed
for the treatment of other malignancies. However, since these compounds target
cellular proteins, they always have the potential for toxicity. In the context of
viral malignancies, we have the unique opportunity of targeting viral proteins,
and developing completely specific therapies. Here we will examine the question
of whether the pathobiology of EBV, KSHV and HTLV-1 will allow the use of such an
approach.
