In early October 2014, 7 months after the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa
began, a cluster of reported deaths in Koinadugu, a remote district of Sierra
Leone, was the first evidence of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in the district.
Prior to this event, geographic isolation was thought to have prevented the
introduction of Ebola to this area. We describe our initial investigation of this
cluster of deaths and subsequent public health actions after Ebola was confirmed,
and present challenges to our investigation and methods of overcoming them. We
present a transmission tree and results of whole genome sequencing of selected
isolates to identify the source of infection in Koinadugu and demonstrate
transmission between its villages. Koinadugu's experience highlights the danger
of assuming that remote location and geographic isolation can prevent the spread 
of Ebola, but also demonstrates how deployment of rapid field response teams can 
help limit spread once Ebola is detected.
