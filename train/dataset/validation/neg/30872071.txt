BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, the virus had caused a high case fatality rate.
The clinical presentation of MERS varied from asymptomatic to severe bilateral
pneumonia, depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies. There
are few studies examining the mortality predictors in this disease. In this
study, we examined clinical predictors of mortality of Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) infection.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of symptomatic admitted patients to a
large tertiary MERS-CoV center in Saudi Arabia over the period from April 2014 to
March 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analysis was done
using a binary regression model.
RESULTS: A total of 314 symptomatic MERS-CoV patients were included in the
analysis, with a mean age of 48 (±17.3) years. Of these cases, 78 (24.8%) died.
The following parameters were associated with increased mortality, age, WBC,
neutrophil count, serum albumin level, use of a continuous renal replacement
therapy (CRRT) and corticosteroid use. The odd ratio for mortality was highest
for CRRT and corticosteroid use (4.95 and 3.85, respectively). The use of
interferon-ribavirin was not associated with mortality in this cohort.
CONCLUSION: Several factors contributed to increased mortality in this cohort of 
MERS-CoV patients. Of these factors, the use of corticosteroid and CRRT were the 
most significant. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these factors
were a mark of severe disease or actual contributors to higher mortality.
