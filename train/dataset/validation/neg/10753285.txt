PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test whether basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) participates in arterialized vein graft remodeling.
METHODS: Rabbits underwent in vivo gene transfer and carotid interposition vein
grafting. Segments of external jugular vein were infected with an adenovirus that
expressed antisense bFGF RNA (Ad.ASbFGF) at 1 x 10(10) PFU/mL to inhibit new
synthesis of bFGF by cells in the vein graft wall. Control rabbits were treated
with either adenovirus that encoded beta-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) at 1 x 10(10)
PFU/mL or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline solution [PBS]). At 3 days, 3 grafts
per treatment group were harvested for the determination of gene expression of
ASbFGF RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Rabbits were
killed, and perfusion was fixed 2 months after the grafting. Total wall thickness
and lumen circumference of vein grafts and normal arteries were measured in cross
sections. Calculated mean tangential stress (+/-SD) for the ASbFGF-treated group 
and controls was compared for significance. Grafts were immunohistochemically
stained to assess bFGF protein production.
RESULTS: Only the grafts infected with the Ad.ASbFGF gene expressed ASbFGF RNA.
Grafts that were treated with Ad.ASbFGF displayed lower tangential stress (10.9
+/- 2.3 dynes/cm(2)) than PBS alone (22 +/- 2.8 dynes/cm(2)) or Ad. lacZ-treated 
controls (20.6 +/- 5.4 dynes/cm(2); P <.001). Tangential stress in the Ad.ASbFGF 
group was comparable to a normal carotid artery (13.9 +/- 2.1 dynes/cm(2)). The
difference in mean total wall thickness was significant among the 3 treatment
groups: Ad.ASbFGF, 164 +/- 3.4 microm); Ad.lacZ, 100 +/- 3.3 microm; and PBS, 96 
+/- 3.6 microm; P <.01). Luminal circumference was not different among the
groups. The Ad.ASbFGF-treated vein graft wall was composed of thick layers of
concentric smooth muscle cells and elastin fibers in contrast to the sponge-like 
appearance observed in control arterialized vein grafts. Reduction in bFGF
protein was noted only in the Ad.ASbFGF-treated group.
CONCLUSION: Inhibition of bFGF synthesis in vivo with the use of adenoviral gene 
transfer of antisense RNA to bFGF promotes a vein graft with decreased tangential
stress while maintaining the luminal area. The vein graft wall is remodeled and
qualitatively resembles an artery so that wall tangential stress in Ad.ASbFGF and
normal artery are not significantly different. The lack of significant difference
in lumen circumference among groups suggests that wall thickening in the Ad.
ASbFGF grafts is not at the expense of luminal narrowing. Our results suggest
that ASbFGF RNA expression may represent an effective strategy in limiting the
failure of arterialized venous conduits.
