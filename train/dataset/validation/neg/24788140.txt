BACKGROUND/AIM: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) mutations play a role in the development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the association between HBV
polymerase gene mutations and HCC has not been reported. In this study, we
conducted a multi-stage study to identify HCC-related mutations in the reverse
transcriptase (RT) domain of the HBV polymerase gene.
METHODS: A total of 231 HCCs and 237 non-HCC controls from Qidong, China, were
included in this study. The entire sequence of HBV RT was first compared between 
29 HCC and 35 non-HCC cases, and candidate mutations were then evaluated in two
independent validation sets.
RESULTS: There were 15 candidate mutations identified from the discovery set,
with A799G and T1055A being consistently associated with HCC across all studies. 
A pooled analysis of samples revealed that A799G, A987G, and T1055A were
independent risk factors for HCC, with adjusted odds ratios of 5.53 [95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.69-18.10], 4.20 (95%CI, 1.15-15.35), and 3.78 (95%CI,
1.45-9.86), respectively. A longitudinal study showed that these mutations were
detectable 4-5 years prior to HCC diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence the first that HBV RT contains naturally
occurring mutations that can be used as predictive markers for HCC.
