Sporadic human infections have been reported with a few select avian influenza
(AI) viruses over the past 50 years. Most of the infections resulted from the
H7N7 high pathogenicity AI (HPAI) virus from The Netherlands (2003) and H5N1 HPAI
viruses from several Asian countries (1997-2005). Epidemiological studies have
identified direct exposure to infected poultry as the primary risk factor for
human infection. In The Netherlands, veterinarians, cullers and poultry farmers
had an occupational risk of infection through exposure to infected commercial
poultry, and presented with conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like illnesses. In
Asia, most of the clinical infections involved direct exposure to poultry in the 
smallholder sector or live poultry markets, and not commercial poultry. However, 
serological data from Hong Kong during 1997 indicated H5N1 infections without
clinical disease were associated with occupational exposure. No cases of human AI
infection have been linked to consumption of infected or contaminated poultry
products. However, HPAI virus can be present in blood, bone and meat of infected 
poultry, which, if consumed raw, are a potential source of virus for human
infections. Cooking and pasteurisation are effective methods of killing AI
viruses. Proper vaccination of poultry has been shown to prevent HPAI virus from 
localising in the meat.
