A recurrent theme in viral immune evasion is the sabotage of MHC-I antigen
presentation, which brings virus the concomitant issue of 'missing-self'
recognition by NK cells that use inhibitory receptors to detect surface MHC-I
proteins. Here, we report that rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP) encodes a Qa-1 like
protein (pQa-1) via RNA splicing to counteract NK activation. While pQa-1 surface
expression is stabilized by the same canonical peptides presented by murine Qa-1,
pQa-1 is GPI-anchored and resistant to the activity of RHVP pK3, a ubiquitin
ligase that targets MHC-I for degradation. pQa-1 tetramer staining indicates that
it recognizes CD94/NKG2A receptors. Consistently, pQa-1 selectively inhibits
NKG2A+ NK cells and expression of pQa-1 can protect tumor cells from NK control
in vivo. Collectively, these findings reveal an innovative NK evasion strategy
wherein RHVP encodes a modified Qa-1 mimic refractory to MHC-I sabotage and
capable of specifically engaging inhibitory receptors to circumvent NK
activation.
