Beet curly top Iran virus (BCTIV) is a distinct geminivirus which has been
reported from sugar-beet-growing farms in Iran. In this study, the role of the
splicing in expression of complementary-sense genes of BCTIV was studied. Total
RNA was extracted from BCTIV-infected tissue, and the predicted intron position
of complementary-sense mRNA transcripts was amplified by RT-PCR followed by
cloning of the amplicons. Sequence confirmed that both spliced and unspliced
mRNAs are synthesized by the same transcription unit. Sequence comparison showed 
that a 155-nt segment (intron) corresponding to nucleotides 1890-2044 of the
viral genome has been removed from the latter transcript and therefore fusion of 
the C1:C2 genes resulted creation of a continuous reading frame for potential
production of intact replication initiator protein (Rep). BCTIV intron comprises 
of most consensus splicing signals required for splicing in eukaryotes and
several plant viruses including mastre- and capulaviruses.
