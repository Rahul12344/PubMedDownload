Heterogeneity of the 3' end of minus-strand RNA in the poliovirus replicative
form.

Richards OC, Ehrenfeld E.

The 3' terminus of the strand (minus strand) complementary to poliovirion RNA
(plus strand) has been examined to see whether this sequence extends to the
5'-nucleotide terminus of the plus strand, or whether minus-strand synthesis
terminates prematurely, perhaps due to the presence of a nonreplicated nucleotide
primer for initiation of plus-strand synthesis. The 3' terminus was labeled with 
32P using [5'-32P]pCp and RNA ligase, and complete RNase digests were performed
with RNases A, T1, and U2. 32P-oligonucleotides were analyzed for size by
polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. The major oligonucleotide products
formed were consistent with the minus strand containing 3' ends complementary and
flush with the 5' end of the plus strand. However, a variable proportion of the
isolated minus strands from different preparations were heterogeneous in length
and appeared to differ from each other by the presence of one, two, or three
3'-terminal A residues.
