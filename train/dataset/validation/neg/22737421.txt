BACKGROUND: Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted disease in many
developed and developing countries mostly caused by Herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2). This study determines the prevalence of HSV-2 infection between two
groups of women with high and low risk behaviors.
METHODS: In this seroepidemiologic study, 362 women attending obstetrics and
gynecology clinics as low risk group and 156 prisoners and drop in center
resident women in Tehran as high risk group were enrolled. HSV infection was
identified by serologic tests on blood samples.
RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG antibody in high risk group was significantly more
than low risk women (26.3% vs. 2.5%). The prevalence of IgM antibody in high risk
group was less than low risk group (3.8% vs. 7.1%) but the difference was not
statistically significant. In high risk group, there was significant association 
between positive IgG and anal/oral sex, use of condom, smoking and drug addiction
as well as genital pain, burning, itching, ulcer, dysuria, and history of genital
infection. In low risk group, association between positive IgM and IgG test
results and risky behaviors were not significant. There was significant
association between IgM and genital itching, rash, and ulcer.
CONCLUSION: Relatively high seroprevalence of anti-HSV-2 IgG and high frequency
of genital Herpes among high risk women necessitates regular screening and safe
sex education programs. Moreover, risk of acute infection in this group should
not be ignored and its distribution in Iranian population should be alarmingly
concerned.
