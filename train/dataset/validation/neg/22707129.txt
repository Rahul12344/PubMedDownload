Usutu virus is a mosquito-borne virus first isolated from Culex naevei in South
Africa in 1959. The first emergence of Usutu virus outside Africa was recorded in
Austria. Here, a phylogenetic analysis targeting the E5 and NS5 genes was carried
out on the viral strains circulating in Europe. The NS5 gene tree showed two main
clades, one of which included the Italian sequences. In the E gene tree all
sequences grouped into the same main clade, with sequences from Austria divided
into two separate clusters. Only sites under negative selective pressure were
found in E and NS5 proteins. The results suggest that Usutu virus circulating in 
Europe has a degree of genetic diversity higher than expected and that infection 
may arise from different sources.
