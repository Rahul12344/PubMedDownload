cold-adapted mutant influenza viruses: oligonucleotide mapping and RNA-RNA
hybridization studies.

Direct biochemical evidence for the existence of mutations in five of the RNA
segments of the A/Leningrad/134/57 cold-adapted 47th passage mutant as compared
with its wild-type progenitor has been obtained using two techniques. T1
oligonucleotide mapping of total viral RNA as well as of individual RNA segments 
revealed changes in RNAs 4, 5 and 6. Analysis of S1 nuclease-treated RNA-RNA
hybrids on polyacrylamide gels revealed changes in at least one of the polymerase
genes as well as in RNAs 4, 5, 6 and 7. These findings provide a direct
demonstration for the existence of multiple mutations in the cold-adapted mutant 
vaccine strain.
