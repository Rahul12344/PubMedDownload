Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with tumours of both lymphoid and
epithelial origin. Whilst a role for EBV latent genes in the development of these
malignancies is accepted, it is also possible that viral proteins involved in EBV
replication may influence the oncogenic process. BHRF1 is an immediate early
protein which has homology with the Bcl-2 oncogene and can protect B cells from
apoptosis. In vivo this protein is most abundantly expressed in the upper layers 
of oral 'hairy' leukoplakia (HL), a benign hyperparakeratotic tongue lesion which
represents a focus EBV replication. We have transfected BHRF1 into the human
squamous cell carcinoma line SCC12F which retains several features of normal
keratinocytes behaviour in vitro. BHRF1 expression in these epithelial cells is
associated with a delay in the commitment of cells to terminal differentiation,
increased resistance to the DNA damaging drug, cis-platin and enhanced survival
under conditions of serum deprivation. As the differentiation of epithelial cells
is an apoptotic process, this data strongly suggests that BHRF1 expression delays
the terminal differentiation of epithelial cells through the prevention of
apoptosis. This effect of BHRF1, which may normally function to promote
productive EBV infection, could contribute to the development of EBV-associated
tumours.
