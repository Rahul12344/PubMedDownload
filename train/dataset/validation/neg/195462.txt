Clinical manifestations of renal allograft derived primary cytomegalovirus
infection.

Betts RF, Freeman RB, Douglas RG Jr, Talley TE.

Seventy seven patients, thirteen younger than 20 years of age, were followed up
prospectively for the first three months after renal transplant for evidence of
infection and illness due to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Thirty-two developed
reactivation of latent CMV and 29 did not develop any CMV infection and wn, five 
had pneumonia, and four underwent nephrectomy. Of these, 16, eleven received a
kidney from a parent, whereas of the other 61 patients, five received parental
kidneys (P less than .001). Hence, CMV seronegative individuals who received a
kidney from a CMV seropositive parent developed clinical illness and sometimes
lost the allograft.
