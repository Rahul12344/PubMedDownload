The immunogenicity of Pandeflu subunit vaccine against influenza
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) was evaluated in 70 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60
years. The vaccine was intramuscularly injected twice at an interval of 28 days. 
Each dose (0.5 ml) contains A(HIN1) influenza virus hemagglutinin (15 +/- 2.2
microg), aluminum hydroxide (Denmark) (0.475 +/- 0.075 microg), and the
preservative thiomerosal (merthiolate) (50 +/- 7.5 microg). The level of
antibodies was determined in the microneutralization assay. After administration 
of two doses of the vaccine at a 28-day interval, the geometric mean antibody
titer (GMAT) reached 1:21.1 with a further increase to 1:30 (the baseline GMAT)
was 1:6.1). The frequencies of seroconversion and seroprotection were 71.4 and
59.2%, respectively; the antibody increase factor was 4.92, which meets the CPMP 
criteria. The administration of the vaccine did not result in adverse reactions
in the postvaccination period.
