Recombinant technology in transfusion medicine has really only just begun to have
large-scale impact. The preparation of blood products, determination of blood
group phenotype, detection of blood group specific antibodies does not currently 
employ DNA-based methods for their preparation or detection. The detection of
bloodborne viruses, production of blood grouping reagents and diagnosis of HLA
polymorphism all include recombinant DNA-based technologies and are beginning to 
impact on routine laboratory life in Transfusion medicine. This review analyses
the current use of recombinant technology in transfusion medicine, and indicates 
where there is likely to be significant development of this methodology
(particularly in molecular diagnostics) oven the next decade or so. The impact of
molecular medicine in the field of transfusion has already begun. Recent
licensing of thrombopoietin for clinical use may have a profound effect on the
very high current demand for platelet transfusions. Gene therapy protocols for
the treatment of haemophilias and other coagulation disorders, and the production
of recombinant blood products may reshape the demand for clotting factors from
human plasma. I also consider the potential impact of the exciting technologies
of DNA arraying and nucleic acid therapeutics in the fields of molecular
diagnostics and the possible treatment of leukemia respectively.
