Fatal encephalopathy complicating lymphoid interstitial pneumonia.

Jefferson M, Riddoch D, Smith WT.

The case is reported of a young woman who suffered from lymphoid interstitial
pneumonia. Involvement of the brain by what appeared to be an identical
pathological process led to her death, and the orbital tissues were also involved
at one stage. The cause of this condition is unknown, but the hypotheses are put 
forward that it may represent one facet of delayed hypersensitivity or that a
slow virus is the responsible aetiological agent. Although lymphoid interstitial 
pneumonia has previously been reported as an isolated entity, the evidence from
this case suggests that it might represent part of pluri-systemic disease.
