Since 2001 models of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, supported by the data 
from the UK epidemic, have been expounded as some of the best examples of
problem-driven epidemic models. These claims are generally based on a comparison 
between model results and epidemic data at fairly coarse spatio-temporal
resolution. Here, we focus on a comparison between model and data at the
individual farm level, assessing the potential of the model to predict the
infectious status of farms in both the short and long terms. Although the
accuracy with which the model predicts farms reporting infection is between 5 and
15%, these low levels are attributable to the expected level of variation between
epidemics, and are comparable to the agreement between two independent model
simulations. By contrast, while the accuracy of predicting culls is higher
(20-30%), this is lower than expected from the comparison between model
epidemics. These results generally support the contention that the type of the
model used in 2001 was a reliable representation of the epidemic process, but
highlight the difficulties of predicting the complex human response, in terms of 
control strategies to the perceived epidemic risk.
