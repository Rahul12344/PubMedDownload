The isolation of a second retrovirus, HIV-2, led to fears that a second AIDS
pandemic, similar in scope and magnitude to that caused by HIV-1, might ensue.
However, the peculiar biologic properties of HIV-2, namely the lower
transmissibility of this virus through both sexual and vertical routes,
contributed to a more regionalized distribution of the virus, which became
endemic in West Africa. HIV-2 is genetically more closely related to SIV than to 
HIV-1. When it comes to clinical disease, the spectrum of opportunistic
infections and tumors (except for Kaposi sarcoma) are similar to that observed
with HIV-1. Controlled longitudinal studies suggest that the rate of progression 
to advanced HIV related disease and mortality are far lower for HIV-2 than for
HIV-1. Understanding how, immunologically and virologically, HIV-2 behaves
differently from HIV-1 may provide some insight into the mechanisms governing
HIV-1 pathogenesis.
