BACKGROUND: The causal interpretation of cervical immune response to Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is complex and poorly characterized mainly due to 
the delicate balance that exists between viral infection, increase of
inflammatory cytokines and host risk factors. This study aims to explore the
significance of cervical immune mediators associated to cell survival,
angiogenesis and interaction with immune response, in predicting the risk to
develop HPV-related intraepithelial lesions.
METHODS: A panel of 48 cytokines and growth factors were explored in a selected
cohort of 168 immunocompetent women including 88 diagnosed with low (LSIL) or
high (HSIL) squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix and 80 with normal
cervical cytology (NIL). HPV genotyping was performed by Linear Array HPV test
and the soluble concentration of 48 immune molecules was analyzed using the
Bio-Plex platform.
RESULTS: The prevalence of single HR-HPV infection was 30% in NIL and 100% in
LSIL and HSIL women. The expression of 13 cytokines, including interleukins IL-6,
IL-3, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-16, IL-18, LIF, of chemokines CCL7 (MCP-3), CXCL9
(MIG), CXCL12 (SDF-1Î±) and of the tropic factors VEGF, G-CSF, M-CSF were
significantly associated with the presence of infection, with levels being higher
in women with precancerous lesions compared to NIL HPV negative women. Only the
growth factor GM-CSF was positively associated with the cytological
abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of HR-HPV to escape from innate immune recognition and
to orchestrate the production of specific inflammatory and growth factors,
involved in early inflammatory response and in the cell-proliferating phase of
intraepithelial damage, was documented in women before the development of
cervical lesions.
