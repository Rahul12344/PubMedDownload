Recent observations indicate that bacterial inclusion bodies formed in absence of
the main chaperone DnaK result largely enriched in functional, properly folded
recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, the molecular basis of this intriguing fact,
with obvious biotechnological interest, remains unsolved. We have explored here
two non-excluding physiological mechanisms that could account for this
observation, namely selective removal of inactive polypeptides from inclusion
bodies or in situ functional activation of the embedded proteins. By combining
structural and functional analysis, we have not observed any preferential
selection of inactive and misfolded protein species by the dissagregating
machinery during inclusion body disintegration. Instead, our data strongly
support that folding intermediates aggregated as inclusion bodies could complete 
their natural folding process once deposited in protein clusters, which conduces 
to significant functional activation. In addition, in situ folding and protein
activation in inclusion bodies is negatively regulated by the chaperone DnaK.
