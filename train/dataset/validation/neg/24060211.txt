Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) spreads primarily by cell-to-cell
transmission. Therefore, HTLV-1 promotes the proliferation of infected cells to
facilitate transmission. In HTLV-1 infected individuals, the provirus is present 
mainly in effector/memory T cells and Foxp3+ T cells. Recent study suggests that 
this immunophenotype is acquired by infected cells through the function of HTLV-1
bZIP factor (HBZ). Tax, which is encoded by the plus strand, is crucial for viral
replication and de novo infection, while HBZ, encoded by the minus strand, is
important for proliferation of infected cells. Importantly, HBZ and Tax have
opposing functions in most transcription pathways. HBZ and Tax cooperate in
elaborate ways to permit viral replication, proliferation of infected cells and
propagation of the virus.
