The study of the antigenic and molecular genetic structure of human acute
encephalomyelitis virus (HAEV) showed a high similarity of the HAEV N gene with
the homologous gene of the fixed rabies virus strain. The results of the
nucleotide sequence analysis indicate that HAEV belongs to the lyssavirus
genotype 1. The N gene sequence is the closest to those of the ERA-CB20-M and
RV-97 strains of the rabies virus. The need for further research into the role of
the human acute encephalomyelitis virus in human pathology stems from past
surveys that revealed the presence of the VNAs against this virus in 6 per cent
of the blood received from donors in the USA and in each third among the patients
with multiple sclerosis in the former USSR.
