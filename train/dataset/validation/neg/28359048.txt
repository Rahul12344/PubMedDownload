Oxysterols are known pleiotropic molecules whose antiviral action has been
recently discovered. Here reported is the activity of a panel of oxysterols
against HSV-1 with the identification of a new mechanism of action. A marked
antiviral activity not only of 25HC but also of 27HC against HSV-1 was observed
either if the oxysterols were added before or after infection, suggesting an
activity unrelated to the viral entry inhibition as proposed by previous
literature. Therefore, the relation between the pro-inflammatory activity of
oxysterols and the activation of NF-kB and IL-6 induced by HSV-1 in the host cell
was investigated. Indeed, cell pre-incubation with oxysterols further potentiated
IL-6 production as induced by HSV-1 infection with a consequent boost of the
interleukin's total cell secretion. Further, a direct antiviral effect of IL-6
administration to HSV-1 infected cells was demonstrated, disclosing an additional
mechanism of antiviral action by both 25HC and 27HC.
