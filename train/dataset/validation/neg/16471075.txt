Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an uncommon cause of heart failure
but has widespread importance because it is the cause of 45% of heart
transplantations. Multiple experimental and clinical lines of evidence have
implicated altered immunity in the pathogenesis of DCM. However, advances in the 
understanding of the mechanisms of altered immunity have not affected the
diagnosis or treatment of DCM. In recognition of this problem, the National
Institutes of Health sponsored an expert workshop with 2 aims: to review the
current understanding of inflammation and immunity as they relate to DCM and to
identify the most promising areas for future clinical research efforts in the
field. This report summarizes the scientific opportunities, perceived needs and
barriers, and workshop recommendations on research directions in DCM. The major
recommendations from the members of the workshop are organized according to the
following themes: cardiotropic viruses, innate and acquired immune responses,
environmental factors, novel diagnostics, and novel therapeutics.
