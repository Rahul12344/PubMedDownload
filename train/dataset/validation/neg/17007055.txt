AIM: To investigate the expression of nucleoporin 88 (Nup88) in hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and C virus (HCV)-related liver diseases.
METHODS: We generated a new monoclonal Nup88 antibody to investigate the Nup88
protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 294 paraffin-embedded liver
specimens comprising all stages of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. In addition, in
cell culture experiments HBV-positive (HepG2.2.15 and HB611) and HBV-negative
(HepG2) hepatoma cell lines were tested for the Nup88 expression by
Western-immunoblotting to test data obtained by IHC.
RESULTS: Specific Nup88 expression was found in chronic HCV hepatitis and
unspecific chronic hepatitis, whereas no or very weak Nup88 expression was
detected in normal liver. The Nup88 expression was markedly reduced or missing in
mild chronic HBV infection and inversely correlated with HBcAg expression.
Irrespective of the HBV- or HCV-status, increasing Nup88 expression was observed 
in cirrhosis and dysplastic nodules, and Nup88 was highly expressed in
hepatocellular carcinomas. The intensity of Nup88 expression significantly
increased during carcinogenesis (P<0.0001) and correlated with dedifferentiation 
(P<0.0001). Interestingly, Nup88 protein expression was significantly
downregulated in HBV-positive HepG2.2.15 (P<0.002) and HB611 (P<0.001) cell lines
as compared to HBV-negative HepG2 cells.
CONCLUSION: Based on our immunohistochemical data, HBV and HCV are unlikely to
influence the expression of Nup88 in cirrhotic and neoplastic liver tissue, but
point to an interaction of HBV with the nuclear pore in chronic hepatitis. The
expression of Nup88 in nonneoplastic liver tissue might reflect enhanced
metabolic activity of the liver tissue. Our data strongly indicate a dichotomous 
role for Nup88 in non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions of the liver.
