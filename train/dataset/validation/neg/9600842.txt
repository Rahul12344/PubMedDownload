X-ray fiber diffraction is potentially powerful in solving the atomic structure
of filamentous assemblies of macromolecules, as demonstrated for tobacco mosaic
virus. However, it requires extremely well-oriented sols to allow for extraction 
of intensities on closely located layer-lines. A high degree of orientation
requires a high filament concentration to restrain the orientational freedom, but
orienting concentrated sols is hampered by their high viscosity. Here, we report 
a systematic method that reproducibly produces extremely good orientation, which 
involves three steps; liquid crystallization, centrifugation and magnetic
orientation. We found that a slow centrifugation can trigger a dynamic
self-orientation process to form perfectly homogeneous liquid-crystalline sols,
and further centrifugation to concentrate sols followed by magnetic orientation
produces exceptionally well-oriented sols. The best-oriented flagellar sol showed
a disorientation angle of 0.6 degrees as 1sigma of its Gaussian distribution. The
new method has been successfully applied to many other systems, such as tobacco
mosaic virus and F-actin.
