Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare but fatal papovavirus 
infection of the central nervous system predominantly affecting immunocompromised
patients. Although the basal ganglia circuitry may be involved in the pathology
of PML, movement disorders are exceedingly rare as presenting symptoms and have
not been described as isolated features in such patients. We report a previously 
healthy, immunocompetent 24-year-old woman with histologically proven PML who
presented with a focal movement disorder of the left arm as an isolated symptom
for many months before diagnosis.
