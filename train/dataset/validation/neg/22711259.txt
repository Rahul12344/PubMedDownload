The 90 % human cytomegalovirus inhibitory concentration of
17-allylamino-17-(demethoxy)geldanamycin (17-AAG) was 0.1 nM and 50 %
cytotoxicity required at least a 10 μM concentration. Three molecular targets may
explain the antiviral activities of this compound. These are (1) heat shock
protein maturation complexes, (2) host cell cycle progression and (3)
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. However, the data suggested a mechanism 
of action where 17-AAG blocked immediate-early protein transactivation.
