In the last decade, the phylogenetic approach is recurrent in molecular
evolutionary analysis. On 12 May, 2019, about 2 296 213 papers are found, but
typing "phylogeny" or "epidemiology AND phylogeny" only 199 804 and 20 133 are
retrieved, respectively. Molecular epidemiology in infectious diseases is widely 
used to define the source of infection as so as the ancestral relationships of
individuals sampled from a population. Coalescent theory and phylogeographic
analysis have had scientific application in several, recent pandemic events, and 
nosocomial outbreaks. Hepatitis viruses and immunodeficiency virus (human
immunodeficiency virus) have been largely studied. Phylogenetic analysis has been
recently applied on Polyomaviruses so as in the more recent outbreaks due to
different arboviruses type as Zika and chikungunya viruses discovering the source
of infection and the geographic spread. Data on sequences isolated by the
microorganism are essential to apply the phylogenetic tools and research in the
field of infectious disease phylodinamics is growing up. There is the need to
apply molecular phylogenetic and evolutionary methods in areas out of infectious 
diseases, as translational genomics and personalized medicine. Lastly, the
application of these tools in vaccine strategy so as in antibiotic and antiviral 
researchers are encouraged.
