BACKGROUND: A new isolate of Aura virus serendipitously discovered as a cell
culture contaminant is reported in this manuscript. Aura virus belongs to the
family Togaviridae and is classified in the genus Alphavirus. There are only two 
reports of Aura virus isolation from mosquitoes in the scientific literature, and
the existence of a vertebrate host is still unknown. The discovery of this new
isolate was based on transmission electron microscopy and nucleic acid
amplification through a non-specific RT-PCR amplification protocol followed by
sequencing.
RESULTS: Genetic analysis has shown that the new virus shares a high degree of
identity with the previously described isolate (GenBank: AF126284.1). A major
difference was observed in the nsP3 gene in which a 234-nucleotide duplication
has been identified. Furthermore, a pronounced difference was observed in cell
cultures compared to the data available for the previously described isolate.
Cell permissiveness and phenotypic characteristics in C6/36, Vero and BHK-21
cells were found to differ from previous reports. This may be due to the genetic 
differences that have been observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The genetic and biological characteristics of the new Aura virus
isolate are suggestive of viral adaptation to the cell substrate. The development
of a cDNA clone will lend a perspective and better understanding of these results
as well as open avenues for its use as a biotechnological tool, as seen for other
alphaviruses.
