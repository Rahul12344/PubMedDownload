The innate immune system provides protection against invading neurotropic
viruses. It acts as the first line of defense against invading viruses and plays 
an elementary role in their pathogenesis. The list of viruses capable of
infecting human central nervous system (CNS) is quite long, most important of
them are Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), rabies virus, West Nile virus (WNV), 
herpes simplex virus (HSV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), La Crosse virus,
tick borne encephalitis virus (TEBE) and polio virus. Germ line pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide
binding oligomerization domain (NOD) - like receptors (NLRs), retinoic
acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) -like helicases or RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and 
cytosolic DNA sensors recognize the pathogen associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) and initiate an immune response against invading pathogen. Although PRRs 
were originally characterized in peripheral immune cells but accumulating
evidence also suggest their crucial roles in CNS to combat against neurotropic
viruses. In this review, we will highlight the recent developments in our
understating of the mechanisms by which PRRs in resident brain cells provide
protection against invading neurotropic viruses.
