Target cells of human adenovirus type 12 in subtentorial brain tissue of newborn 
mice. II. Cytomorphologic and immunofluorescent microscopic studies in vitro.

The normal subtentorial brain cells of newborn mice (C3H/BifB/Ki) were cultured
by the monolayer culture technique. The first subculture was inoculated with
human adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) in an attempt to achieve the transformation of
the brain cells. Normal cultured cells were morphologically divided into
astrocytic cells (Ac-1 cells and Ac-2 cells), immature brain cells including
undifferentiated cells (Ud cells) and glioblastic cells (Gb cells), and
fibroblastic cells (Fb cells). Fluorescent T-antigen first appeared in all type
of cells and gradually decreased. Later, fluorescent T-antigen remained mainly in
the immature brain cells (Gb cells) which grew in clusters on the epithelioid
areas of astrocytic cells. From 21 days after Ad 12 infection, transformed foci
appeared in such epithelioid areas. Morphologically, the transformed cells
resembled immature brain cells, especially Gb cells, in vitro. They often showed 
rosette-like structures, cystic spaces and trabecular patterns in the
subcultures. Tumors which developed through the transplantation of the
transformed cells into subcutaneous tissue and brain of mice were quite similar
to original brain tumors induced by Ad 12. From these findings it is strongly
suggested that, in vitro, the target cells of Ad 12 in the subtentorial tissues
of the mouse brain are immature brain cells, probably Gb cells.
