Multiple and diverse mechanisms have been proposed as supplements to the HIV-1
virus in the destruction of CD4+ cells and the pathogenesis of AIDS. But it is
now realized that 100 times more CD4+ cells are infected with HIV-1 than was
originally thought to be the case, and many antigen-presenting cells are infected
as well. In addition to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, one or a few
supplemental mechanisms may well suffice to explain the progressive loss of CD4+ 
cells, e.g., the considerable variation in the virus and/or the destruction of
uninfected CD4+ cells by one immunological mechanism or another. However, it is
not yet possible to state confidently which additional mechanism(s) is important.
Identification of the nature of this supplemental process has become essential
for successful, nonharmful intervention.
