Immunoglobulin G subclass antibody responses in influenza A and parainfluenza
type 1 virus infections.

Julkunen I, Hovi T, Sepp채l채 I, M채kel채 O.

Antibody responses in immunoglobulin G1, G2, G3, G4, A (IgA1) and M isotypes were
studied in 10 patients with an acute influenza A and in another 10 patients with 
a parainfluenza type 1 virus infection using radioimmunoassay with standardized
monoclonal anti-immunoglobulins. A four-fold or greater increase of antibody in
patients have an acute influenza A virus infection, were found in IgG1 (all 10
cases), IgG3 (seven cases), IgG4 (eight cases) and in IgA1 (six cases) whereas
IgG2 and IgM responses were observed only in one and three cases, respectively.
The antibody titre values were converted to immunoglobulin units by multiplying
the titre by a pre-determined correction coefficient compensating for the varying
affinity of the individual monoclonal anti-immunoglobulins. These units were then
used to calculate the actual proportions of each isotype. In the convalescent
phase, 78% of total anti-influenza A antibodies were estimated to be of IgG1
isotype and other immunoglobulin isotypes varied from 3 to 7% of total. Similar
results in parainfluenza virus antibodies were obtained with serum pairs from
patients with an acute parainfluenza virus infection.
