Mosaic symptoms were observed on the tip parts of upper leaves of Datura
stramonium L. (2-3 cm in length), systemically infected with potato virus X
(PVX); symptoms were absent on basal parts of the same leaves. Virus-like
particles were not observed in the parenchyma cells of the basal parts lacking
symptoms. Considerable retraction of the plasmalemma from the cell wall and the
appearance of vesicles and tubules between them were the most characteristic
features of such cells. In the tip parts of the leaves with mosaic symptoms,
numerous PVX particles were observed in many parenchyma cells, where they were
dispersed in the cytoplasm or grouped in aggregates. As a rule the dispersed PVX 
virions were associated with specific laminated inclusions. Sometimes virions
appeared in areas of the cytoplasm subjected to local autolysis. The tonoplast
was often disturbed in infected cells, and virus particles were released into a
central vacuole.
