Women account for almost 60% of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
infections in Sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-1 prevention tools such as condoms,
abstinence and monogamy are not always feasible options for women due to various 
socio-economic and cultural factors. Microbicides are anti-microbial medications 
formulated for topical administration to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1
and other pathogens. Ideally, they will afford bidirectional protection to both
men and women who are engaged in vaginal or anal sex. Since the use of condom is 
often difficult or impossible, this multifunctional role of microbicides will be 
crucial in the fight against AIDS. The 15th Conference on Retroviruses and
Opportunistic Infections (CROI) was recently held in Boston, USA, where one of
the most interesting subject area discussed by researchers from all around the
world was the latest developments and understandings in microbicide-related basic
science and pre-clinical product development as well as in product manufacturing 
and formulation that address the issue of user adherence.
