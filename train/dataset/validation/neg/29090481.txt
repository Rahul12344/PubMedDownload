OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary infiltrates in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (allo-HSCT) patients are potentially life-threatening and require
early diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to retrospectively explore the clinical
efficacy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in conjunction with flexible
bronchoscopy (FB) in allo-HSCT patients with pulmonary infiltrates.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing FB
after allo-HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology from January
2013 to December 2016. We used PCR to detect various viruses in FB specimens,
particularly for 27 viruses.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine diagnostic FBs were performed in 130 patients.
The overall diagnostic yield was 58%. Eighty-nine percent of the patients with a 
positive FB result were diagnosed with a pulmonary infection. Viruses were the
most common infectious diagnosis (70%), followed by fungi (48%), bacteria (38%), 
and Pneumocystis jirovecii (12%). Multivariate analyses showed that a chest
computed tomography (CT) finding of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (P = .012) and 
positive results in assisted microbiological and serological analyses (P = .000) 
predicted a positive FB result. FB results prompted a treatment modification in
61% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: FB in conjunction with PCR is efficient in the rapid diagnosis and
management of pulmonary infiltrates in allo-HSCT patients.
