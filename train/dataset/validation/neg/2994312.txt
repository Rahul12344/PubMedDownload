Differential replication of SV40 and polyoma DNAs in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

La Bella F, Ozer HL.

We have investigated the ability of CHO cells to allow growth of papovaviruses by
analyzing viral DNA replication after transfection using the calcium-phosphate
co-precipitation technique. These analyses showed that when SV40-containing
plasmids were introduced into CHO cells, viral DNA replicated to a level of
approximately 1000 copies per T antigen-expressing cell, and neither late
proteins nor virus progeny were produced. When polyoma (Py)-containing plasmids
were transfected into CHO cells, a ten-fold higher level of Py DNA was present
per T antigen-positive cell, and viral capsid proteins and progeny virus were
detected, indicating that CHO cells are not equally restricted for all
papovaviruses. Infection with intact virions was restricted in both cases. These 
results indicate that either SV40 or Py DNA introduced into CHO cells are able to
express their early viral functions, and that different interactions of cellular 
proteins involved in the replication machinery with viral nucleic acids and
proteins result in different levels of viral DNA synthesis and virus progeny
production. We propose that, because of their favorable genetic characteristics, 
CHO cells should, therefore, provide a valuable experimental system for
definition of the cellular contributions to papovavirus replication.
