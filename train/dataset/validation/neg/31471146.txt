BACKGROUND: Vaccination provides protection against infection by inducing VNAs
mainly against RABV surface GP. The measurement of VNAs to RABV is commonly used 
to assess the level of immunity in humans and animals after vaccination. A VNA
titer of  ≥ 0.5 IU/mL of sera indicates adequate response to vaccination. Here,
we report the development and validation of a RABV GP serology ELISA kit for
semi-quantitative measurement of VNA titers in sera of vaccinated human subjects.
METHODS: Using a recombinant RABV GP expressed in mammalian cells as the capture 
antigen, the ELISA method was established using HuMAb NM57 reference initially
and HRIG reference subsequently. The limit of detection (LOD), linear range,
reproducibility, and precision of the method were examined. Specificity and
sensitivity were established to assess the diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: RABV GP for ELISA plate coating and optimal dilution of human serum
sample was 1 µg/mL and 1:20, respectively. Multiple assays were carried out by
different technicians at different laboratories for assay standardization. Using 
the HRIG reference, the LOD was found to be 0.02-0.06 IU/mL and the linear range 
was 0.2-10.0 IU/ mL. The inter-assay CVs were in the range of 6.60-10.79%,
indicating the reproducibility. None of the 12 known negative human sera, tested 
positive by ELISA, highlighting the specificity. A total of 415 unknown positive 
human sera were double-blind tested by the RFFIT and ELISA. The VNA titer cut-off
value of ELISA was set at 1.5 IU/mL to ensure no false-positive. The diagnostic
specificity and sensitivity were 100% and 91.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The validation data characterize this ELISA as a suitable method for
semi-quantitative measurement of VNA titers in human serum samples to assess
vaccination status. The ELISA kit can offer simplicity, speed, low cost and high 
throughput, making it a practical tool for monitoring the immune response
following vaccination.
