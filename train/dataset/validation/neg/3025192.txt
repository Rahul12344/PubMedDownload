Transplasmalemma electron transport is changed in simian virus 40 transformed
liver cells.

Transplasma membrane electron transport activity by fetal rat liver cells
(RLA209-15) infected with a temperature-sensitive strain of SV40 has been
measured with cells grown at the restrictive temperature (40 degrees C) and
permissive temperature (33 degrees C). The transformed cells grown at 33 degrees 
C had only one-half the rate of external ferricyanide reduction as the
nontransformed cells held at 40 degrees C. Both the Km and Vmax for ferricyanide 
reduction were changed in the transformed state. The change in Vmax can be based 
on a decrease of NADH in the transformed cells. The change in rate with
ferricyanide does not depend on change in surface charge. Reduction of external
ferricyanide was accompanied by release of protons from the cells. The ratio of
protons released to ferricyanide reduced was higher in the transformed cells than
in the non-transformed cells. Since the transplasma membrane electron transport
has been shown to stimulate cell growth under limiting serum, the changes in the 
plasma membrane electron transport and proton release in transformed cells may
relate to modification of growth control.
