A recombinant vaccinia virus was constructed that expressed poliovirus coat
precursor protein P1 fused to about two-thirds of the 2A proteinase. The
truncated 2A segment could be cleaved away from the P1 region by coinfecting with
poliovirus type 1, 2, or 3 or with human rhinovirus 14 but not with
encephalomyocarditis virus. Further cleavage of the vector-derived P1 to yield
mature poliovirus capsid proteins was not observed. Attempts to isolate vaccinia 
virus recombinants containing portions of the poliovirus genome that encompassed 
the complete gene for proteinase 2A were unsuccessful, unless expression of
functional 2A was abolished by insertion of a frameshift mutation. We conclude
that an activity of the 2A proteinase, probably its role in translational
inhibition, prevented isolation of vaccinia virus recombinants that expressed 2A.
