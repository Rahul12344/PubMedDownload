Peptide vaccine was found to be an effective and powerful approach to a variety
of pathogens. To explore multi-epitope based peptide vaccines against infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV), the immunogenic peptides were fused to the 3' terminal of
glutathione S transferase gene (GST) and expressed in Escherichia coli. ELISA and
Western blot analysis showed that the purified fusion proteins had excellent
immune activity with chicken anti-IBV serum. During the vaccination course, the
candidate peptide vaccines induced strong humoral and cellular response, and
provided up to 80.0% immune protection, while all non-immunized chickens in the
negative control group manifested obvious typical symptoms and died after virus
challenge. Our finding provides a new way to develop multi-epitope based peptide 
vaccine against IBV.
