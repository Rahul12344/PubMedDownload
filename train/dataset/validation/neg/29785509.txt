Why, so far, have epidemics always eventually petered out? Quasispecies theory
suggests a (testable!) answer.

In this paper, it is argued that the fact that, so far, even the worst and most
far-reaching epidemics-from the Plague of Athens in 430 BC and the Plague of
Justinian in 541/542 AD to the Hong Kong Flu from 1968/69-always finally petered 
out can be explained using Manfred Eigen's quasispecies concept: Indeed, as the
infectious agents, while duplicating themselves in the infected organisms, mutate
all the time, these infected organisms carry along quite a multitude of
mutational variants or-in Manfred Eigen's terms-a whole quasispecies of
infectious agents implying that, within that quasispecies, those variants that
differ from the wild type may actually serve as some kind of vaccination program 
when infecting some previously uninfected persons. In this context, some data
regarding various recent epidemics will also be illustrated, using Daniel Huson's
SplitsTree software tool.
