Persistence of mumps viral antigens in mouse brain.

Hayashi K, Ross ME, Notkins AL.

Newborn mice were infected intracerebrally with a fresh isolate of mumps virus.
Although infectious virus could not be recovered after the acute infection,
direct immunofluorescence demonstrated the persistence of mumps antigens for up
to 100 days after the initial infection.
