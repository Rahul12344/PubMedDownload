Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes BamHIA rightward transcript (BART) microRNAs
(miRNAs). These miRNAs are expressed at high levels in epithelial tumors, such as
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). BART miRNAs play important roles in
EBV-associated malignancies, however, the reason for their high expression in NPC
is unclear. We performed multiple sequence alignment of six completely sequenced 
EBV strains: Akata, YCCEL1, SNU719, C666-1, Mutu I, and M81. A single-nucleotide 
deletion was identified at the promoter region of BART. The luciferase assay
suggested that this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly increased 
BART promoter activity. In addition to deletion, substitution at the same site
also increased BART promoter activity. Analysis of the 170 EBV genome sequences
from NPC and EBV-associated gastric cancers revealed that the frequency of this
SNP was associated with NPC incidence and this SNP was found to be accumulated in
the BART promoter region. Overall, our results suggested that this SNP should
enhance BART promoter activity and thus, might contribute to the development of
EBV-associated epithelial malignancies.
