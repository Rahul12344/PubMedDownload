A prospective study of herpes simplex virus infection in a defined population in 
Houston, Texas.

Adler-Storthz K, Dreesman GR, Kaufman RH, Melnick JL, Adam E.

A seroepidemiologic study was conducted to determine the incidence of antibodies 
to herpes simplex virus in a population of middle-class Caucasian women. In utero
exposure to diethylstilbestrol did not influence the frequency of herpes simplex 
virus infection. The frequency of infection increased with age and number of sex 
partners and a 50% increase in incidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection
was noted during the 4-year period of the study. Subclinical herpes simplex virus
type 2 infections apparently occurred in some women without preexisting
antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1.
