The specific hydrolytic activity of PON1 paraoxonase/arylesterase enzymes in
liver and blood provides a natural barrier against the entry of organophosphate
toxins into the central and peripheral nervous systems. Inherited differences in 
PON1 enzyme concentrations may determine levels of susceptibility to
organophosphate injury in humans. To test whether boosting serum levels of PON1
enzymes by gene therapy might provide increased protection, we compared the
degree of inactivation of whole brain acetylcholinesterase of mice exposed to
chlorpyrifos 4 days after intravenous injection of recombinant adenoviruses
containing PON1-LQ or PON1-LR genes or no PON1 gene. Both recombinant viruses
containing PON1 genes boosted serum arylesterase concentrations by approximately 
60% and significantly prevented the inactivation of brain acetylcholinesterase.
Some mice were completely protected. These findings indicate that boosting serum 
levels of PON1 enzymes by a gene delivery vector raises the threshold for
organophosphate toxicity by hydrolytic destruction before the chemical can enter 
the brain.
