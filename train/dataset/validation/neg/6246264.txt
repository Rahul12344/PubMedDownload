Comparative biochemical studies of type 3 poliovirus.

Minor PD.

A study of the biochemistry of type 3 poliovirus strains which involves the
examination of the virus-coded polypeptides in infected cells and the preparation
of oligonucleotide maps is reported. The polypeptide patterns were shown to be a 
relatively stable property of virus strains and distinguished Sabin vaccine
strains from wild strains of poliovirus type 3. This approach may be of value in 
deciding the origin (vaccine or nonvaccine) of field isolates of poliovirus.
Oligonucleotide maps were found to be sensitive indicators of differences among
strains and appear to form a basis for determining genetic relationships among
strains. The nucleotide maps of two viruses isolated from human cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis temporally associated with the administration of
attenuated vaccine suggested a vaccine origin for the strain. In one case the
nucleotide map was indistinguishable from that of the vaccine strain.
