Genotype determination is recommended before starting anti-HCV therapy to
determine the duration of treatment (PEG-Interferon+ribavirin). The Versant HCV
Genotype 2.0 assay, based on the reverse hybridization of the 5'UTR segment and
core region of hepatitis C virus (HCV), has been one of the assays used most
widely for HCV genotyping. A multicenter evaluation of the more automated Abbott 
RealTime HCV Genotype II assay was carried out on 124 HCV positive sera tested
previously with the Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 assay. There was good agreement
between the two assays. Type concordance was 95.9% (117/122) while concordance at
the subtype level for genotype 1 was 95.6% (43/45). The Abbott RealTime HCV
Genotype II assay is automated, allowing a substantial reduction of time-to
results and hands-on time. The combined features of full automation, objective
interpretation and digital archiving make this assay useful in a diagnostic
setting.
