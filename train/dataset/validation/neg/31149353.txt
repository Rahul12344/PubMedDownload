Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses continue to pose a
pandemic threat. US national vaccine stockpiles are a cornerstone of the
influenza pandemic preparedness plans. However, continual genetic and antigenic
divergence of A(H5Nx) viruses requires the development of effective vaccination
strategies using stockpiled vaccines and adjuvants for pandemic preparedness.
Human sera collected from healthy adults who received either homologous (2 doses 
of a AS03A-adjuvanted A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005, A/Turkey), or heterologous (primed 
with AS03A-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/5/2005, A/Indo, followed by A/Turkey boost)
prime-boost vaccination regimens were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition and
microneutralization assays against 8 wild-type HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses from 6
genetic clades. Molecular, structural and antigenic features of the A(H5Nx)
viruses that could influence the cross-clade antibody responses were also
explored. Compared with homologous prime-boost vaccinations, priming with a clade
2.1.3.2 antigen (A/Indo) followed by one booster dose of a clade 2.2.1 antigen
(A/Turkey) administered 18 months apart did not compromise the antibody responses
to the booster vaccine (A/Turkey), it also broadened the cross-clade antibody
responses to several antigenically drifted variants from 6 heterologous clades,
including an antigenically distant A(H5N8) virus
(A/gyrfalcon/Washington/410886/2014, clade 2.3.4.4) that caused recent outbreaks 
in US poultry. The magnitude and breadth of the cross-clade antibody responses
against emerging HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses are associated with genetic, structural and
antigenic differences from the vaccine viruses and enhanced by the inclusion of
an adjuvant. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination with AS03A adjuvanted vaccine
offers a vaccination strategy to use existing stockpiled vaccines for pandemic
preparedness against new emerging HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses.
