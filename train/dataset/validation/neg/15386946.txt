OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of HLA-B alleles in the Chinese Yi
ethnic group and its association with HIV infection.
METHODS: One hundred and six unrelated healthy HIV negative and 73 HIV positive
Chinese Yi ethnic individuals were typed by PCR-SSP.
RESULTS: The frequency of alleles B*07, Bx 35, and B*46 were increased in
HIV-1-positive subjects, whereas the alleles B*55, B*44 and B*78 were absent in
the HIV-infected persons studied. The B*46 allele was present in a significantly 
higher gene frequency among HIV-1-positive individuals (P=0.02, OR=3.32, 95%
CI=1.13-9.78) compared with control subjects.
CONCLUSION: HLA-B*46 may be associated with its susceptibility to HIV-1
infections.
