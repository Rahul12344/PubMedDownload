Comparative studies of H3N2 influenza virus strains isolated in May-June, 1982,
and in the subsequent epidemic in February, 1983: antigenic and genome analysis.

Comparative studies have been undertaken on the H3N2 influenza virus strains
isolated in Leningrad in May-June, 1982 and those isolated in the subsequent
winter epidemic in February, 1983. Analysis of the isolates with ferret antisera 
against standard influenza viruses of the H3N2 subtype and with monoclonal
antibodies against A/Bangkok/1/79 virus revealed a considerable but similar
degree of heterogeneity in the HA antigenic specificity of the strains isolated
in the spring-summer, 1982, as in the winter, 1983, periods and also a close
resemblance between the antigenic specificities of the strains of these two
epidemics. However comparative genome analysis of the strains using cRNA:vRNA
hybridization technique revealed that in terms of the gene homology, the
influenza virus strains which circulated in the spring-summer period of 1982
resembled the strains responsible for the previous rather than subsequent
epidemic.
