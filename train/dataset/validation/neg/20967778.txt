We provide an experimental test of the universal behavior arising in simulations 
of the electrophoretic collision of a long DNA molecule with an isolated, thin
post. Our experiments take advantage of a robust protocol to embed matrices of
circa 100 nm radius ZnO nanowires in a microfluidic channel. The density and
height of the nanowires are easily controlled by the seeding and growth
conditions. Single-molecule videomicroscopy of λ-DNA electrophoresis in a sparse 
nanowire array shows that the average holdup time decays exponentially with the
impact parameter, in agreement with simulations. Only at the largest electric
field studied here does the hooking probability approach that for an
infinitesimally thin post.
