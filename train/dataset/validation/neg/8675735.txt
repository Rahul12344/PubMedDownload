AIMS: To investigate the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in long term
survivors of haematological malignancy treated before the introduction of blood
donor screening in September 1991.
METHOD: Patients were tested for evidence of HCV infection by third generation
enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, a recombinant immunoblot assay and reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Serum aspartate aminotransferase
activities were measured. The number and type of blood component units received
by each patient were recorded.
RESULTS: Forty two patients were studied who had received a total of 7143 blood
component units. Two patients (4.8%) were found to have HCV infection, both had
histological evidence of chronic active hepatitis, and one is now receiving
treatment with alpha-interferon. Both of these patients had been missed by the
ongoing look-back programme which aims to detect recipients of all known HCV
infected blood components.
CONCLUSION: Although HCV infection affects a minority of long term survivors of
haematological malignancy, infected patients may benefit from alpha-interferon
treatment. The screening of all patients treated for haematological malignancy
before September 1991 is advocated.
