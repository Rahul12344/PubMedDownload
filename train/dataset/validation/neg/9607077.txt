Fifteen host-range (h) mutants of cyanophage N-1 were characterized with
reference to their efficiency of plating, time of appearance, morphology and size
of plaques on Nostoc muscorum and its three phage-resistant (Nm 1/N-1, Nm 2/N-1
and Nm 8/N-1) mutants. While phage N-1 did not adsorb to the three
phage-resistant mutants, the h mutants differed one from the other in having
lower or higher adsorption rate constants on N. muscorum or the phage-resistant
mutants. The inability of majority of h mutants isolated on Nm 1/N-1 to grow in
Nm 8/N-1 was shown to be due to a failure of adsorption. The h mutants also
differed one from the other in their reversion (back mutation) frequencies. The
lethal doses (LD37) required to kill 37% of free phage particles after
UV-irradiation, heating and ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) treatment greatly
varied. Most of the h mutants were found to be considerably more sensitive to UV 
and thermic inactivation than N-1 while they were resistant to EDTA. The h
mutants except five of them were unable to multiply at 40 degrees C. The
significance of these features is discussed.
