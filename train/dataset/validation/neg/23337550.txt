BACKGROUND: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated,
multisystemic disease that combines a granulomatous inflammatory process with
lymphoproliferative potential. It is a rare disorder with a variable clinical
presentation ranging from an indolent process to an aggressive B-cell lymphoma.
Outcome is unpredictable, and a standard treatment has not yet been established. 
Cases treated with rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, have been
reported with variable results.
OBSERVATION: We report on 2 children with LG treated with rituximab and review
the literature. The first patient had good response but the second did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab is a treatment option for LG.
