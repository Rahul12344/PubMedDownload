Memory T cells mount an enhanced response to secondary infections. Such an
enhancement has been attributed in part to the ability of memory cells to more
rapidly respond to cognate stimulation. In this study we have examined the
rapidity with which murine CD8(+) memory T cells respond to a localized infection
with HSV. Although central memory T cells (TcM), but not the effector memory T
cells, mounted a strong recall response to secondary infection, the kinetics of
TcM proliferation, the magnitude of their expansion, and their infiltration into 
infected nonlymphoid tissues were not advanced compared with that observed for
naive T cells. These findings imply that it is the lack of accelerated
proliferation kinetics and the subsequent delayed dissemination into the
periphery that limits the ability of TcM to rapidly control localized virus
replication.
