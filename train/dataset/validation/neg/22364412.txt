Bacteriophages use specific tail proteins to recognize host cells. It is still
not understood to molecular detail how the signal is transmitted over the tail to
initiate infection. We have analysed in vitro DNA ejection in long-tailed
siphovirus 9NA and short-tailed podovirus P22 upon incubation with Salmonella
typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We showed for the first time that LPS alone
was sufficient to elicit DNA release from a siphovirus in vitro. Crystal
structure analysis revealed that both phages use similar tailspike proteins for
LPS recognition. Tailspike proteins hydrolyse LPS O antigen to position the phage
on the cell surface. Thus we were able to compare in vitro DNA ejection processes
from two phages with different morphologies with the same receptor under
identical experimental conditions. Siphovirus 9NA ejected its DNA about 30 times 
faster than podovirus P22. DNA ejection is under control of the conformational
opening of the particle and has a similar activation barrier in 9NA and P22. Our 
data suggest that tail morphology influences the efficiencies of particle opening
given an identical initial receptor interaction event.
