With the availability of better treatment and prophylactic regimens for the
infectious complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the
non-infectious complications are gaining greater attention. HIV-related pulmonary
arterial hypertension (HIV-PAH) is one of these. The incidence of HIV-PAH is
estimated at 0.5% of HIV-infected individuals. The pathogenesis remains unclear. 
Patients present with symptoms as diverse as progressive shortness of breath,
pedal edema, dry cough, fatigue, syncope, as well as chest pain. Chest X-ray
always shows cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary artery, and evidence of right
ventricular hypertrophy can be seen from the electrocardiogram. The pulmonary
arterial systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance 
from right heart catheterization are increased. There are a few small studies
showing the benefit of prostacyclin analog (epoprostenol and iloprost) and
bosentan. The role of antiretrovirals remains controversial, as do those of other
agents such as calcium channel blockers and anticoagulants. The prognosis of
HIV-PAH is grave. Two thirds of HIV-PAH related mortality is usually secondary to
consequences of pulmonary hypertension, with the worst survival noted in New York
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV. The probability of survival in 
one series was 73%, 60% and 47% at one, two and three years, respectively.
