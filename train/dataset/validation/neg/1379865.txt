Cell-to-cell spread of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is presumed to occur through
plant intercellular connections, the plasmodesmata. Viral movement is an active
process mediated by a specific virus-encoded P30 protein. P30 has at least two
functions, to cooperatively bind single-stranded nucleic acids and to increase
plasmodesmatal permeability. Here, we visualized P30 complexes with
single-stranded DNA and RNA. These complexes are long, unfolded, and very thin
(1.5 to 2.0 nm in diameter). Unlike TMV virions (300 x 18 nm), the complexes are 
compatible in size with the P30-induced increase in plasmodesmatal permeability
(2.4 to 3.1 nm), making them likely candidates for the structures involved in the
cell-to-cell movement of TMV. Mutational analysis using single and double
deletion mutants of P30 revealed three regions potentially important for the
protein function. Amino acid residues 65 to 86 possibly are required for correct 
folding of the active protein, and the regions between amino acid residues 112 to
185 and 185 to 268 potentially contain two independently active single-stranded
nucleic acid binding domains designated binding domains A and B, respectively.
