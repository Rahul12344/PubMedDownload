To evaluate the antigenic relationship between bat mumps virus (BMV) and the JL5 
vaccine strain of mumps virus (MuVJL5), we rescued a chimeric virus bearing the F
and HN glycoproteins of BMV in the background of a recombinant JL5 genome
(rMuVJL5). Cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization between this chimeric
recombinant MuV bearing the F and HN glycoproteins of BMV (rMuVJL5-F/HNBMV) virus
and rMuVJL5 were demonstrated using hyperimmune mouse serum samples and a curated
panel of human serum. All mouse and human serum samples that were able to
neutralize rMuVJL5 infection had cross-neutralizing activity against
rMuVJL5-F/HNBMV. Our data suggest that persons who have neutralizing antibodies
against MuV might be protected from infection by BMV.
