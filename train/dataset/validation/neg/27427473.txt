A molecular diagnostic assay utilizing reverse transcription-recombinase
polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) at an isothermal constant temperature of 39°C
and target-specific primers and probe were developed for the rapid, sensitive,
and specific detection of tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid (TCDVd) in infected leaf 
and seed tissues. The performance of the AmplifyRP(®) Acceler8™ RT-RPA diagnostic
assay, utilizing a lateral flow strip contained within an amplicon detection
chamber, was evaluated and the results were compared with a standard RT-PCR
assay. The AmplifyRP(®) Acceler8™ assay was specific for TCDVd in leaf and seed
tissues, its sensitivity was comparable to conventional RT-PCR in leaf tissues,
and it does not require extensive sample purification, specialized equipment, or 
technical expertise. This is the first report utilizing an RT-RPA assay to detect
viroids and the assay can be used both in the laboratory and in the field for
TCDVd detection.
