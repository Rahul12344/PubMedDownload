A cohort of 81 HIV-infected participants received seasonal trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine (TIV) and their humoral responses were monitored using
hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). Three weeks after the vaccination, the percentage of the cohort that had
an HAI titer of >1:40 was 35% (for H1N1), 43% (for H3N2) and 19% (for influenza
B). An increase in HAI titer can be achieved by an increase in magnitude of the
antibody responses, which can be measured by an increase in ELISA titer; as well 
as a quality improvement of the antibody responses through increased avidity to
the virus. For some individuals, an increase in avidity alone is sufficient to
reach the sero-protective titer. Notably, a number of volunteers showed an
increase in ELISA titer without a rise in HAI titer. A total of 24 participants
(30%) did not show any significant increase in both HAI and ELISA tests after
vaccination. Apart from a lower peripheral CD4+ T cell count, the non responders'
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) also had a higher IL-10 mRNA expression
after TIV vaccination ex vivo. Cytokine profiling demonstrated that, apart from a
weaker MCP-1 expression in the non-responder group, PBMC from both groups
responded comparably to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro. Since only
3 participants developed sero-protective titers against all 3 subtypes after
vaccination, our study highlights a need to enhance the immunogenicity of the
subunit vaccine for this population, potentially through harnessing the innate
immunity with an external adjuvant.
