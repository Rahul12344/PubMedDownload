Fourteen patients with radiculomyelitis following acute haemorrhagic
conjunctivitis (AHC) were seen in Bangkok during October to December 1974. Most
patients developed weakness of extremities 2 weeks after AHC. Prodromal symptoms 
consisted of fever and malaise for a few days, followed by the acute onset of
root pain in the legs and flaccid paralysis. Knee and ankle reflexes were absent 
or diminished. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed lymphocytosis and an
increase in protein. Electromyographic findings were consistent with anterior
horn cell or motor root lesions. Ten of the 12 cases in which virological studies
were performed showed definite serological evidence of AHC virus infection. Six
patients received corticosteroid treatment but apart from relief of pain no
significant improvement was seen. Motor weakness in 10 patients was less at the
end of 2 months, but in 4 it remained unchanged. The occurrence of disabling
neurological sequelae calls for effective public health control of AHC outbreak.
