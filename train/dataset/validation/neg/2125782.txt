The hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers have been studied in 184 household contacts
of 110 thalassemic patients and 184 normal individuals matched for age and
socioeconomic status with the study subjects. The mean age (+/- SD) in both
patients and control subjects was 31.1 +/- 13.5 years. HBV infection had occurred
in 51.6% of the household contacts and in 32.1% of the control subjects. This
difference is highly significant (p less than 0.001). The most frequent marker
observed was the antihepatitis B core IgG followed by the antihepatitis B surface
antibody. It is noteworthy that none of the thalassemic patients infected in the 
past was seropositive for the hepatitis B surface antigen at the time of the
study, whereas its frequency in the general population was 8.1%. The findings
indicate that the household contacts of thalassemic patients have a greater
seroprevalence for hepatitis B infection. Furthermore, the household contacts of 
thalassemic patients are infected at a younger age than the control population.
The high infection rate with HBV in all groups tested suggests that vaccination
should be considered not only for the household contacts of thalassemic patients 
but possibly for the entire Greek population.
