The aim of this study was to develop and test a multivalent subunit vaccine
against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) based on the E2 virus glycoprotein
belonging to genotypes 1a, 1b and 2a, immunopotentiated by targeting these
antigens to antigen-presenting cells. The E2 antigens were expressed in insect
cells by a baculovirus vector as fusion proteins with a single chain antibody,
named APCH I, which recognizes the β-chain of the MHC Class II antigen. The three
chimeric proteins were evaluated for their immunogenicity in a guinea pig model
as well as in colostrum-deprived calves. Once the immune response in
experimentally vaccinated calves was evaluated, immunized animals were challenged
with type 1b or type 2b BVDV in order to study the protection conferred by the
experimental vaccine. The recombinant APCH I-tE21a-1b-2a vaccine was immunogenic 
both in guinea pigs and calves, inducing neutralizing antibodies. After BVDV type
1b and type 2 challenge of vaccinated calves in a proof of concept, the type 1b
virus could not be isolated in any animal; meanwhile it was detected in all
challenged non-vaccinated control animals. However, the type 2 BVDV was isolated 
to a lesser extent compared to unvaccinated animals challenged with type 2 BVDV. 
Clinical signs associated to BVDV, hyperthermia and leukopenia were reduced with 
respect to controls in all vaccinated calves. Given these results, this
multivalent vaccine holds promise for a safe and effective tool to control BVDV
in herds.
