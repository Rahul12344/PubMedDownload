BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C viral (HCV) proteins, including core, demonstrate
immuno-modulatory properties; however, the effect of extracellular core on
natural killer (NK) cells has not previously been investigated.
AIMS: To characterise NKs in acute HCV infection over time, and, to examine the
effect of exogenous HCV-core protein on NK cell phenotype and function.
METHODS: Acute HCV patients (n = 22), including 10 subjects who spontaneously
recovered, were prospectively studied. Flow-cytometry was used to measure natural
cytotoxicity and to phenotype NKs directly ex vivo and after culture with
HCV-core protein. Microarray analysis was used to identify pathways involved in
the NK cell response to exogenous HCV-core.
RESULTS: Direct ex vivo analysis demonstrated an increased frequency of
immature/regulatory CD56bright NKs early in acute HCV infection per se which
normalized with viral clearance. Natural cytotoxicity was reduced and did not
recover after viral clearance. There was a statistically significant correlation 
between the frequency of CD56bright NKs and circulating serum levels of HCV core 
protein. In vitro culture of purified CD56bright NK cells with HCV-core protein
in the presence of IL-15 maintained a significant proportion of NKs in the
CD56bright state. The in vitro effect of core closely correlates with NK
characteristics measured directly ex vivo in acute HCV infection. Pathway
analysis suggests that HCV-core protein attenuates NK interferon type I
responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HCV-core protein alters NK cell maturation and
may influence the outcome of acute infection.
