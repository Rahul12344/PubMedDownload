PURPOSE: Radioresistance may be caused by cancer stem cells (CSC). Because CSCs
require telomerase to proliferate, a telomerase-specific oncolytic adenoviral
vector carrying apoptotic tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
and E1A gene (Ad/TRAIL-E1) may preferentially target CSCs.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established two pairs of parental and radioresistant (R) 
esophageal carcinoma cell lines (Seg-1, Seg-1R and TE-2, TE-2R) by fractionated
irradiation. Stem cell markers were measured by Western blotting and flow
cytometry. Serial sorting was used to enrich stem-like side population cells.
Telomerase activity, transgene expression, antitumor activity, apoptosis
induction, and viral replication were determined in vitro and/or in vivo.
RESULTS: Expression of the stem cell markers beta-catenin, Oct3/4, and beta(1)
integrin in Seg-1R cells was 29.4%, 27.5%, and 97.3%, respectively, compared with
4.8%, 14.9%, and 45.3% in Seg-1 cells (P < 0.05). SP levels in Seg-1R and TE-2R
cells were 14.6% and 2.7%, respectively, compared with 3.4% and 0.3% in Seg-1 and
TE-2 cells. Serial sorting of Seg-1R SP cells showed enrichment of the SP cells. 
Telomerase activities in Seg-1R, Seg-1R SP, and TE-2R cells were significantly
higher than in Seg-1, Seg-1R non-SP, and TE-2 cells, respectively (P < 0.05).
Seg-1R and TE-2R cells were more sensitive to Ad/TRAIL-E1 than parental cells.
Increased Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor and elevated transgene expressions were
found in the radioresistant cells. Ad/TRAIL-E1 resulted in significant tumor
growth suppression and longer survival in Seg-1R-bearing mice (P < 0.05) with no 
significant toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Radioresistant cells established by fractionated irradiation display 
CSC-like cell properties. Ad/TRAIL-E1 preferentially targets radioresistant
CSC-like cells.
