BACKGROUND: Immunization of mice with the G protein of respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) characteristically induces an immune response that is partially
protective, but which can prime for pulmonary eosinophilia. We have shown
previously that the N191A mutation in a recombinant RSV G protein fragment is
associated with reduced pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration when administered
with alum subcutaneously in BALB/c mice followed by RSV challenge. We hypothesize
that the performance of this "epitope enhanced" recombinant G protein fragment
may be further improved by combining with the newly developed adjuvant,
Protollin, coupled with intranasal delivery.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate efficacy of an intranasally delivered,
Protollin-adjuvanted, epitope-enhanced recombinant G protein vaccine in BALB/c
mice.
STUDY DESIGN: Recombinant protein, designated Trx-G128-229, consisted of a
bacterially expressed central fragment (amino acids 128-229) of the RSV Long
strain G protein fused to a fragment of thioredoxin (Trx). BALB/c mice were
chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of wild type and epitope-enhanced
Trx-G128-229 as a nasal vaccine with the adjuvant Protollin.
RESULTS: The intranasal administration of Trx-G128-229 with Protollin conferred
similar protection against RSV challenge as subcutaneously administered
Trx-G128-229 with alum, but with markedly reduced eosinophilia and the Th2
cytokine IL-13.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the concept of an RSV vaccine optimized by
combined strategies, including epitope enhancement and judicious selection of
adjuvants.
