Influenza infections cause airway epithelial inflammation and oxidant-mediated
damage. In this setting, cellular antioxidant enzymes may protect airway
epithelial cells against damage resulting from toxic oxygen radicals produced by 
activated leukocytes. Therefore, we tested the effect of influenza virus
infection, as well as exposed to human recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), 
on gene expression for the antioxidant enzymes manganese superoxide dismutase
(MnSOD), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO), and catalase in primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells. In
these cells, both viral infection and IFN-gamma increased MnSOD and IDO mRNAs. In
contrast, neither viral infection nor IFN-gamma affected Cu/ZnSOD gene
expression, and both viral infection and IFN-gamma decreased catalase gene
expression. The differential effects of viral infection on antioxidant gene
expression and their further amplification by IFN-gamma are likely to be
important protective mechanisms in viral airway infections.
