An optimally effective AIDS vaccine would likely require the induction of both
neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, which has proven
difficult to obtain in previous clinical trials. Here we report on the induction 
of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-specific immune responses in
healthy adult volunteers that received the multi-gene, polyvalent, DNA
prime-protein boost HIV-1 vaccine formulation, DP6-001, in a Phase I clinical
trial. Robust cross-subtype HIV-1 specific T cell responses were detected in
IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. Furthermore, we detected high titer serum antibody
responses that recognized a wide range of primary HIV-1 Env antigens and also
neutralized pseudotyped viruses that express the primary Env antigens from
multiple HIV-1 subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the DNA prime-protein
boost approach is an effective immunization method to elicit both humoral and
cell-mediated immune responses in humans, and that a polyvalent Env formulation
could generate broad immune responses against HIV-1 viruses with diverse genetic 
backgrounds.
