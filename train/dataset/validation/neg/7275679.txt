Fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome in a scalded child after immunization
with attenuated virus (measles, mumps and rubella).

Pfenninger J, Zimmermann A.

A fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in a 15-month-old
child who had suffered minor scalding during the febrile response to combined
attenuated virus immunization (measles, mumps and rubella [MMR]). Despite
vigorous efforts the child died 26 days after the accident. It is suggested that 
the scalding suppressed the normal immune response to the viremia and that the
latter (i.e. most likely the measles viremia) caused the lung damage which, in
turn, led to the ARDS. Histologically the lung presented a peculiar change with
fibroblastic nodules, vessel wall inflammation and signs as observed in ARDS.
