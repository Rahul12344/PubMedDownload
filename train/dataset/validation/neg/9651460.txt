OBJECTIVES: To compare language development in infants and young children with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to language development in children 
who had been exposed to HIV but were uninfected, and (among subjects with HIV
infection) to compare language development with cognitive and neurologic status.
DESIGN: Prospective evaluation of language development in infected and in exposed
but uninfected infants and young children.
SETTING: Pediatric Infectious Disease Clinic, State University of New York-Health
Science Center at Syracuse.
SUBJECTS: Nine infants and young children infected with HIV and 69 seropositive
but uninfected infants and children, age 6 weeks to 45 months.
RESULTS: Mean Early Language Milestone Scale, 2nd edition (ELM-2) Global Language
scores were significantly lower for subjects with HIV infection, compared with
uninfected subjects (89.3 vs 96.2, Mann-Whitney U test). The proportion of
subjects scoring >2 SD below the mean on the ELM-2 on at least one occasion also 
was significantly greater for subjects with HIV infection, compared with
uninfected subjects (4 of 9 infected subjects, but only 5 of 69 uninfected
subjects; Fisher's exact test). Seven of the 9 subjects with HIV infection
manifested deterioration of language function. Four manifested unremitting
deterioration; only 1 of these 4 demonstrated unequivocal abnormality on
neurologic examination. Three subjects with HIV infection and language
deterioration showed improvement in language almost immediately after the
initiation of antiretroviral drug treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging or
computed tomography of the brain were performed in 6 of 7 infected subjects with 
language deterioration, and findings were normal in all 6. ELM-2 Global Language 
scaled scores showed good agreement with the Bayley Mental Developmental Index or
the McCarthy Global Cognitive Index (r = 0. 70). Language deterioration, or
improvement in language after initiation of drug therapy, coincided with or
preceded changes in global cognitive function, at times by intervals of up to 12 
months.
CONCLUSIONS: Language deterioration occurs commonly in infants and young children
with HIV infection, is seen frequently in the absence of abnormalities on
neurologic examination or central nervous system imaging, and may precede
evidence of deterioration in global cognitive ability. Periodic assessment of
language development should be added to the developmental monitoring of infants
and young children with HIV infection as a means of monitoring disease
progression and the efficacy of drug treatment.
