PIP: The 1st case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Malaysia was
detected in 1987, 1 year after the Ministry of Health established a national AIDS
task force. The patient was a 45-year-old Chinese man of Malaysian origin who had
been living overseas for the past 30 years. The patient denied any homosexual
relationships, blood transfusions, of intravenous drug use; however, he reported 
multiple sexual partners 10 years prior to developing AIDS. At hospital
admission, the patient was in acute respiratory distress and Pneumocystis carinii
was isolated from his sputum. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western
blot tests revealed antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The T-
helper/T-suppressor cell ratio was inverted, 16:51%. There were no antibodies to 
cytomegalovirus or toxoplasmosis. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement
after treatment with co-trimoxazole and was released from the hospital 2 weeks
after admission. Although this is the 1st case of full-blown AIDS in Malaysia,
individuals with antibodies to HIV have been identified.
