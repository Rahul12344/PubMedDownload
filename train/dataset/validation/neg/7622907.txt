To determine whether defects in mucosal immunity were associated with invasive
disease caused by a mucosal pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, levels of
salivary immunoglobulins and nonspecific immune factors were compared in subjects
with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and in
HIV-1-seronegative subjects with and without pneumococcal bacteremia. The IgA2
subclass may be of particular importance because S. pneumoniae produces IgA1
protease, which cleaves IgA1 but not IgA2. Levels (37-56 micrograms/mL) and
proportions (11%-17%) of IgA2 were similar among groups. Serotype-specific
capsular salivary IgA was present in a minority of patients with acute
bacteremia. Levels of lactoferrin were increased with bacteremia. Neither
selective mucosal IgA2 deficiency nor impaired nonspecific upper respiratory
mucosal responses were associated with invasive pneumococcal disease during HIV-1
infection; thus, other defects in mucosal cellular responses and systemic
immunity may predispose HIV-1-infected patients to invasive pneumococcal disease.
