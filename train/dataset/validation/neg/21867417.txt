In some mosquito species the conditions experienced by larvae during development 
have been shown to lead to changes in susceptibility to various arboviruses in
the adult female. Since laboratory mosquitoes are generally reared under ideal
conditions, mosquito vector competence experiments in the laboratory may not
accurately reflect vector?virus relationships in nature. We examined the
consequences of larval nutritional stress on Culex tarsalis vector competence for
West Nile virus (WNV). Larval nutrition deprivation resulted in increased
development time, decreased pupation and emergence rates, and smaller adult
female body size. However, infection, dissemination, and transmission rates for
WNV at 5, 7, and 14 days postfeeding were not consistently affected. These
results suggest that larval nutritional rearing protocols are not a major factor 
in laboratory estimates of WNV vector competence in Cx. tarsalis.
