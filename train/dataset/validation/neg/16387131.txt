BACKGROUND: Recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) is often treated with interferon
and ribavirin combination therapy but results have been disappointing. Given the 
promising results reported with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for hepatitis 
C, this combination is now preferred for the treatment of recurrent HCV. This
article reports a transplantation program's experience with antiviral therapy
treatment for liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV.
METHODS: Between October 2002 and June 2004, patients with recurrent HCV were
screened to determine if they were eligible for treatment. Liver function tests, 
HCVRNA, and liver biopsies were done on all patients prior to treatment. HCVRNA
was repeated at 3 months, end of treatment (EOT), and 6 months after EOT for
patients HCVRNA-negative at EOT. Patients were prospectively followed up after
starting weekly pegylated interferon alfa-2a 180 mcg/wk and ribavirin 1000-1200
mg/d (Roche, Nutley, NJ, United States) with folic acid 1 mg/d.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were eligible for treatment with a median age of
49.2 years. Twenty-one patients have completed treatment, 6 remain on treatment, 
and 5 were intolerant. In an intention-to-treat analysis, sustained HCVRNA
eradication occurred in at least 40.6% of patients. Side effects led to treatment
withdrawal in 5 patients (15.6%).
CONCLUSION: Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin appear promising for the
treatment of recurrent HCV. Side effects were an infrequent cause of treatment
discontinuation, unlike previous combinations of interferon-based therapy.
Randomized, prospective trials incorporating serial liver biopsies with
appropriate quality of life analyses are required to manage this silent epidemic.
