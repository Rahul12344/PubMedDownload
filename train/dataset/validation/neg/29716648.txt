Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the archetypal fish alloherpesvirus and the
etiologic agent of a lethal disease in common and koi carp. To date, the genome
sequences of only four CyHV-3 isolates have been published, but no comparisons of
the biologic properties of these strains have been reported. We have sequenced
the genomes of a further seven strains from various geographical sources, and
have compared their growth in vitro and virulence in vivo. The major findings
were: (i) the existence of the two genetic lineages previously described as
European and Asian was confirmed, but inconsistencies between the geographic
origin and genotype of some strains were revealed; (ii) potential inter-lineage
recombination was detected in one strain, which also suggested the existence of a
third, as yet unidentified lineage; (iii) analysis of genetic disruptions led to 
the identification of non-essential genes and their potential role in virulence; 
(iv) comparison of the in vitro and in vivo properties of strains belonging to
the two lineages revealed that inter-lineage polymorphisms do not contribute to
the differences in viral fitness observed; and (v) a negative correlation was
observed among strains between viral growth in vitro and virulence in vivo. This 
study illustrates the importance of coupling genomic and biologic comparisons of 
viral strains in order to enhance understanding of viral evolution and
pathogenesis.
