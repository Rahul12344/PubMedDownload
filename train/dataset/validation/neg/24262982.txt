Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is associated with adrenal
disorders, which must not be underestimated. Adrenal morphologic changes are
primarily related to opportunistic infections, mostly by cytomegalovirus and
mycobacteria, and malignant tumours such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's
sarcoma. The most frequent biological alteration reported to date is the
increases in cortisol concentrations which results from a decrease in cortisol
metabolism and hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis commonly
referred to as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. These modifications can be a
consequence of antiretroviral therapy and do not require any investigation or
specific treatment. Conversely, adrenal insufficiency, either iatrogenic or
secondary to glandular infiltration by neoplasms or infections, needs long-term
substitution with hydrocortisone, but at present occurs more rarely and usually
at late stages of disease progression. The impact of HIV infection on the other
adrenocortical functions has been less reported in the literature although
several studies show low levels of adrenal androgens, especially
dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA). Impairment in mineralocorticoid function
appears occasional and remains a subject of debate.
