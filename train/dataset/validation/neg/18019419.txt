Several 3-formylchromone derivatives were examined for their tumor
cell-cytotoxic, anti-Helicobacter pylori, urease inhibitory and anti-HIV
activity. Comparing their relative cytotoxicity against four human tumor cell
lines and three normal human cells, tumor cell-specific cytotoxicity was detected
in some 3-formylchromone derivatives. There was no clear-cut relationship between
the cytotoxicity and the chemical structures of the compounds.
6,8-Dichloro-3-formylchromone (FC10) showed comparable anti-H. pylori activity
with metronidazole and potent urease inhibition against jack bean urease. On the 
other hand, 6,8-dibromo-3-formylchromone (FC11) exhibited potent inhibitory
activity against the urease, but had no anti-H. pylori activity. No chromones
(FC1-16) exhibited anti-HIV activity.
