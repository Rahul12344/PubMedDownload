Human plasma-derived protein concentrates intended for clinical use must be
treated for viral inactivation to ensure patient safety. This study explored the 
use of liquid iodine for inactivation of several lipid- and nonlipid-enveloped
viruses in an antithrombin III (AT-III) concentrate. Iodine at levels of 0.01% to
0.02% caused between 43% and 94% loss of AT-III activity, as well as degradation 
of AT-III as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. However, addition of up to 0.1% human
albumin protected the AT-III against both inactivation and fragmentation. At
albumin levels sufficient to retain greater than 75% of AT-III activity, greater 
than 6 logs of sindbis, encephalomyocarditis, and vesicular stomatitis viruses,
greater than 4 logs of pseudorabies, and greater than 3 logs of human
immunodeficiency virus were inactivated. Except with sindbis virus, this
represented complete inactivation of all the viruses spiked into the AT-III
concentrate.
