The role of ozone on earth is controversial, as in the stratosphere it is
protective against excessive ultra violet irradiation, and in the troposphere it 
is toxic for animals and plants. The effectiveness of ozone against pathogens is 
well recognized and ozone appears to be the best agent for sterilization of
water. In spite of this, the use of ozone in medicine has been overlooked or
despised, mostly because it has been either misused or used without appropriate
controls. Studies carried out in our laboratory have revealed that ozone can
display relevant biological effects and that, having defined its therapeutic
index, can become an important and reliable drug for the treatment of several
diseases. An exciting new aspect is that ozone, being a strong oxidizer, can
stimulate the increase of cellular anti-oxidant enzymes, eventually inhibiting
the oxidative stress.
