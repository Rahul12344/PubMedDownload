Induction of mutations in bacteriophage T7 by gamma-rays: no influence of the SOS
repair pathway.

Bleichrodt JF, Roos-Verheij WS.

Under conditions where the reversion of an amber mutant of bacteriophage lambda
by gamma-rays is enhanced by subjecting the irradiated phage to SOS repair,
gamma-ray-induced reversion of two T7 ambers is not influenced by this
error-prone bacterial repair system. The survival of T7 gamma-irradiated under
anoxic conditions is somewhat enhanced by SOS repair, whereas the survival of
phage irradiated under oxygen is not affected.
