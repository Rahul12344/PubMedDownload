F-like pili specified by conjugative plasmids have been reported to contain
phosphate which may be noncovalently incorporated into the pilus. Electron
spectroscopic imaging was able to detect phosphate in the filamentous,
single-stranded DNA phage f1, used as positive control, but could not detect
phosphate in F-like pili. Thus, the phosphate in purified pili which has been
reported is probably derived from contaminating cell envelope material.
