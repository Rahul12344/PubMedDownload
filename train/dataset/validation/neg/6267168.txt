Physical mapping of temperature-sensitive mutations of herpes simplex virus type 
2 by marker rescue.

Chartrand P, Wilkie NM, Timbury MC.

The physical mapping of six ts mutations of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)
is presented. The results were obtained from 14 separate intratypic marker rescue
experiments and the analysis of 20 HSV-1/HSV-2 intertypic recombinants. The order
of these mutations on the physical map of HSV-2 is unambiguous and correlates
almost exactly with the previously published genetic map of Timbury & Calder
(1976). One of the mutants studied (HSV-2 ts12) has apparently two distinct
conditionally lethal ts mutations, one in the long and the other in the short
region of the HSV genome.
