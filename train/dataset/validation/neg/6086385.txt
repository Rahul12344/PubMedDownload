Host cell reactivation capacity of different strains of E. coli B resistant or
sensitive to ozone.

L'HÃ©rault P, Chung YS.

Host cell reactivation capacity for ozonated or irradiated phage was determined
for different strains of E. coli either more sensitive or resistant to ozone than
the wild type strain. The results suggest that the ozr gene product could be
involved in the same repair pathway for ozone-induced lesions on DNA as the polA 
gene. The possible involvement of a specific endonuclease for these lesions is
also considered.
