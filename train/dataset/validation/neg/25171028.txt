The burden of hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-4) is high in Africa and East
Mediterranean countries. Previous reports estimate sustained virologic response
(SVR) rates in HCV-4 to be ∼20-70%. However, many of these studies are limited by
different study designs and small sample sizes. Our aim was to evaluate treatment
outcome and host/viral factors on SVR in HCV-4 patients treated with pegylated
interferon and ribavirin (PEG IFN+RBV) in a systematic and quantitative manner. A
comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE and EMBASE for 'genotype 4' was
conducted in November 2013. Abstracts from American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases, Asian Pacific Study of the Liver, Digestive Disease Week, and
European Association for the Study of the Liver in 2012/2013 were reviewed.
Inclusion criteria were original studies with at least 25 treatment-naive HCV-4
patients treated with PEG IFN+RBV. Exclusion criteria were coinfection with HIV, 
hepatitis B virus, or other genotypes. Effect sizes were calculated using
random-effects models. Heterogeneity was determined by Cochrane Q-test (P<0.05)
and I statistic (>50%). We included 51 studies (11 102 HCV-4 patients) in the
primary analysis. Pooled SVR was 53% [95% confidence interval (CI): 50-55%]
(Q-statistic=269.20, P<0.05; I=81.43). On subgroup analyses, SVR was
significantly associated with lower viral load, odds ratio (OR) 3.05 (CI:
1.80-5.17, P<0.001); mild fibrosis, OR 3.17 (CI: 2.19-4.59, P<0.001); and
favorable IL28B polymorphisms, rs12979860 CC versus CT/TT, OR 4.70 (CI:
2.87-7.69, P<0.001), and rs8099917 TT versus GT/GG, OR 5.21 (CI: 2.31-11.73,
P<0.001). HCV-4 patients treated with PEG IFN+RBV may expect SVR rates of ∼50%.
Lower viral load, mild fibrosis, and favorable IL28B (rs12979860 CC and rs8099917
TT) are positively associated with SVR.
