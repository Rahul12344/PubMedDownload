Human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic retrovirus and its
infection is associated with a variety of human diseases including
HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropic spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Large numbers 
of epidemiological, virological, immunological, and clinical studies on HTLV-I-
and HTLV-I-associated diseases have been published, although the pathogenesis of 
HAM/TSP remains to be fully understood. In the last several years, researchers
have shown that several key factors are important in HTLV-I-associated neurologic
disease including high HTLV-I proviral load and a strong immune response to
HTLV-I. Here, we review pathophysiological findings on HAM/TSP and focus on
viral-host immune responses to the virus in HTLV-I infected individuals. In
particular, the role of HTLV-I-specific CD8+ T cell response is highlighted.
