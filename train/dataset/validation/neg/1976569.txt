The genomes of many RNA viruses terminate in a tertiary structure similar to the 
L-conformation of tRNAs and this structure is recognized by many tRNA-specific
enzymes such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Virtually the entire 3'-untranslated
region (UTR) of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA is involved in an extended
tertiary structure containing, in addition to a tRNA-like structure, a pseudoknot
domain that lies immediately upstream. Although the functions of these structures
are not well understood, they are essential to the virus. We demonstrate that the
addition of the 204-base TMV 3'-untranslated region to foreign mRNA constructs
can increase gene expression up to 100-fold compared to nonadenylated mRNA. The
3'-UTR of TMV was equal to or greater than a polyadenylated tail in enhancing
gene expression in electroporated dicot and monocot protoplasts. The TMV 3'-UTR
is functionally similar to a polyadenylated tail in that it increases mRNA
stability and translation and must be positioned at the 3' terminus to function
efficiently. Similar effects on expression were observed in Chinese hamster ovary
cells, demonstrating that the sequence functions in a wide range of eukaryotes.
When the extended tertiary structure was dissected, the upstream pseudoknot
domain was found to be largely responsible for increasing expression. The
inclusion of the tRNA-like structure, however, was important for full regulation.
