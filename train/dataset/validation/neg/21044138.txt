The innate immune system provides the first line of host defense against invading
pathogens. Innate immune responses are initiated by germline-encoded PRR, which
recognize specific structures expressed by microorganisms. TLR are a family of
PRR which sense a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi,
protozoa and viruses. TLR are also expressed in the intestine and are critical
for intestinal homeostasis. Recently, cytoplasmic PRR, such as NLR and RLR, have 
been shown to detect pathogens that have invaded the cytosol. One of the NLR,
NOD2, is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. This
review focuses on the innate immune responses triggered by PRR in the intestine.
