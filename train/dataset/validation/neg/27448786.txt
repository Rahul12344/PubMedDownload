Even though gene therapy made its way through the clinics to treat a number of
human pathologies since the early years of experimental research and despite the 
recent approval of the first gene-based product (Glybera) in Europe, the safe and
effective use of gene transfer vectors remains a challenge in human gene therapy 
due to the existence of barriers in the host organism. While work is under active
investigation to improve the gene transfer systems themselves, the use of
controlled release approaches may offer alternative, convenient tools of vector
delivery to achieve a performant gene transfer in vivo while overcoming the
various physiological barriers that preclude its wide use in patients. This
article provides an overview of the most significant contributions showing how
the principles of controlled release strategies may be adapted for human gene
therapy.
