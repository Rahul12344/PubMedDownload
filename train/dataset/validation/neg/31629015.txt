The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been revolutionised by the
advent of oral, well-tolerated, direct acting antiviral therapies (DAA), with
high cure rates. However, in some scenarios, HCV resistance to antiviral
therapies may have an impact on treatment success. Public Health England's HCV
Resistance Group was established to support clinicians treating people with HCV, 
where the issue of resistance may be a factor in clinical decision-making, and
this review includes the Group's current recommendations on the use of HCV
resistance testing. The authors describe the principles behind and approach to
HCV resistance testing and consider evidence from in vitro studies, clinical
trials and real world cohorts on the impact of HCV resistance on treatment
outcomes for particular DAA regimens. Five scenarios are identified in the UK and
similar settings, where, in the Group's opinion, resistance testing should be
performed.
