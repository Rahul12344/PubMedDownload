An electrochemical genosensor based on an epoxy-phenanthroline-Fe(III)-NH2-ssDNA 
layer for the detection of RNA derived from Avian Influenza is presented. The
biosensor preparation consists of: (I) modification of gold electrodes with
aminoethanethiol, (II) modification of the self-assembled monolayer of
aminoethanethiol with 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10]-phenanthroline using "click"
chemistry, (III) a first step of complexation of Fe(III) by
5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10]-phenanthroline, (IV) a second step of complexation
of Fe(III) by 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-[1,10]-phenanthroline, (V) immobilization of 
the single stranded amino-DNA probe via "click" chemistry between epoxy and amino
groups. The interactions between the ssDNA probe and RNA targets were explored
with Osteryoung Square Wave Voltammetry. The genosensor showed a remarkable
detection limit of 3 copies/µL (5 aM) for RNA extracted from A/swan/Poland/305/06
(H5N1) containing a fully complementary sequence. A linear dynamic range for this
sequence was observed from 3.0×103 to 3.0×105 [copies/µl]. RNA extracted from
A/mallard/Poland/446/09 (H7N7), containing a non-complementary sequence,
generated a much weaker response. Moreover, the developed genosensor allows to
distinguish RNA present in biological samples having 2, 3 and 4 mismatches. This 
biosensing approach can become a potential alternative tool for detecting RNA
samples in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis of avian influenza
viruses.
