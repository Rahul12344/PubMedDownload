[Intestinal cryptosporidiosis in suspected acquired immune deficiency].

[Article in German]

Bertram U, Lampert F.

In a 13-year-old boy--with haemophilia A, positive tests for HTLV-III antibodies,
and lymphocytopenia--there occurred watery voluminous stools which persisted over
many months. Cryptosporidia were demonstrated microscopically in the stool.
Cryptosporidiosis should be considered in patients with acquired immune
deficiency who have diarrhoea.
