Diarrhea, a disease of poverty and poor sanitation, kills an estimated two
million children each year. Oral rehydration therapy is a very simple and
inexpensive treatment that has significantly reduced mortality from secretory
diarrhea caused by rotavirus, cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The
efficacy and adoption of oral rehydration therapy would be enhanced by a drug
that reduces fluid loss associated with these diseases and alleviates disease
symptoms. Secretion and absorption by the intestine offer a number of potential
drug targets to reduce fluid loss. Among these, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is the most attractive because it
is the primary driver of secretion in cases of diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic
bacteria. CFTR can be inhibited by both natural products and synthetic small
molecules. iOWH032 is a synthetic CFTR inhibitor that has recently entered
clinical trials for this indication.
