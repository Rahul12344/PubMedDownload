PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) type-16 has been associated with invasive
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This study examines the role of
HPV-16 in the progression of oral head and neck cancer by determining the
quantity of HPV-16 DNA in premalignant and malignant lesions, using real-time
quantitative PCR, to more accurately determine the role of HPV-16 in oral head
and neck squamous cell carcinogenesis.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined 102 microdissected premalignant head and neck
lesions (85 from the oral cavity), 34 invasive oral cavity squamous cell
carcinomas, as well as 18 invasive tumors known to be HPV positive by traditional
molecular technology for the presence of HPV-16 DNA using real-time quantitative 
PCR.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 1 of 102 premalignant lesions (0.98%), 1 of 34
(2.9%) invasive oral cavity carcinomas, and 14 of 18 (78%) known HPV-positive
tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV-16 infection and integration is seldom found in oral
premalignant lesions and invasive carcinoma, and therefore rarely contributes to 
malignant progression in the oral cavity. Furthermore, quantitative PCR is a
useful technique that reliably excludes contaminated samples and those with
minimal HPV DNA content that is unlikely to be significant in carcinogenesis.
