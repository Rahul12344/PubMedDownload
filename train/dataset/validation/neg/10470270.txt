The causative agent of tobacco mosaic and of foot and mouth disease (FMD) were
recognized in 1898 as "filterable" or "invisible"--and eventually termed "virus".
Four years later the viral aetiology of yellow fever was established, and the new
discipline took off. Thus animal virology started with a veterinary problem, and 
Germany's contribution during the following decades came mainly from the chairs
of veterinary teaching and research establishments in Giessen, Munich and
Hanover, the Riems Institute, and the Federal Research Institute for Animal Virus
Diseases in TÃ¼bingen. From a superficial bibliometric analysis, a wide divergence
in impact figures is noted, with excellent contributions in international
virology journals and lesser papers in German veterinary journals. The
publications in the observed time frame reveal a fascination by virion structure,
physical characteristics and structure-function relationships with little work
published in journals dedicated to immunology and pathogenesis.
