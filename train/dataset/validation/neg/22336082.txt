BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus infections are the
most common significant infant respiratory tract illnesses and are associated
with increased but differential risks of childhood asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether maternal asthma is associated with
higher odds of infant respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus versus RSV and 
increased infection severity.
METHODS: Mother-infant dyads were enrolled from 2004-2008 during an infant
respiratory tract infection (104 with rhinovirus and 279 with RSV). Mothers were 
classified into mutually exclusive groups (atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and
no asthma). We determined viral cause using PCR and the severity of the infant's 
respiratory tract infection using the bronchiolitis severity score. Adjusted
relative odds of maternal asthma with viral cause were calculated by using
logistic regression. Proportional odds models assessed the association of
maternal asthma and infant infection severity.
RESULTS: Infants with a mother with atopic asthma compared with infants whose
mothers did not have asthma were more likely to have rhinovirus versus RSV
infection (adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.19-4.90). Similarly, among
infants with rhinovirus, having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with
increased infection severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.98). This
relationship was not seen among infants with RSV.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant rhinovirus infection during infancy was more 
strongly associated with having a mother with atopic asthma than clinically
significant RSV infection. Having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with
increased severity of infant rhinovirus but not RSV infections. Infants with
rhinovirus were more likely to have a familial atopic predisposition, which might
partly explain the subsequent increased asthma risk.
