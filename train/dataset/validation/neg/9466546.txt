Trends in the use of antimicrobials in France between 1980-1981 and 1991-1992
were analyzed. Data were obtained from surveys of health and ambulatory care,
which were based on national probability samples. In a 3-month period in 1980,
17% of the population of France was treated with an antibiotic, compared with 25%
in 1991 (P < .001). The frequency of respiratory tract infections with a presumed
viral etiology that were diagnosed and treated with antibiotics increased by 86% 
for adults and 115% for children in the 11-year period. The proper use of
cephalosporins must be encouraged, and vigilance is required in view of the
increased improper use of fluoroquinolones, mainly for respiratory tract
infections with a presumed viral etiology.
