Cellular secretion of proteins into the extracellular environment is an essential
mediator of critical biological mechanisms, including cell-to-cell communication,
immunological response, targeted delivery, and differentiation. Here, we report a
novel methodology that allows for the real-time detection and imaging of single
unlabeled proteins that are secreted from individual living cells. This is
accomplished via interferometric detection of scattered light (iSCAT) and is
demonstrated with Laz388 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell
line. We find that single Laz388 cells actively secrete IgG antibodies at a rate 
of the order of 100 molecules per second. Intriguingly, we also find that other
proteins and particles spanning ca. 100 kDa-1 MDa are secreted from the Laz388
cells in tandem with IgG antibody release, likely arising from EBV-related viral 
proteins. The technique is general and, as we show, can also be applied to
studying the lysate of a single cell. Our results establish label-free iSCAT
imaging as a powerful tool for studying the real-time exchange between cells and 
their immediate environment with single-protein sensitivity.
