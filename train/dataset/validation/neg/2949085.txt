Structure of helical RecA-DNA complexes. Complexes formed in the presence of
ATP-gamma-S or ATP.

Egelman EH, Stasiak A.

Electron micrographs of RecA-DNA filaments, formed under several different
conditions, have been analyzed and the filament images reconstructed in three
dimensions. In the presence of ATP and a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog.
ATP-gamma-S, the RecA protein forms with DNA a right-handed helical complex with 
a pitch of approximately 95 A. The most detailed view of the filament was
obtained from analysis of RecA filaments on double-stranded DNA in the presence
of ATP-gamma-S. There are approximately six subunits of RecA per turn of the
helix, but both this number and the pitch are variable. From the examination of
single filaments and filament-filament interactions, a picture of an extremely
flexible protein structure emerges. The subunits of RecA protein are seen to be
arranged in such a manner that the bound DNA must be partially exposed and able
to come into contact with external DNA molecules. The RecA structure determined
in the presence of ATP-gamma-S appears to be the same as the "pre-synaptic" state
that occurs with ATP, in which there is recognition and pairing between
homologous DNA molecules.
