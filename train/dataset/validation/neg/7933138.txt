Influenza virus A/seal/Mass/1/80 (H7N7) mutants were obtained; the hemagglutinins
(HAs) of the mutants were not activated by trypsin, as in the wild-type virus,
but by thermolysin. The mutants grew efficiently under multiple replication cycle
conditions and formed plaques in chicken embryo cells only when thermolysin was
added to the culture medium. They exhibited hemolytic activity and induced
protective immunity in chickens after an asymptomatic course of infection.
Nucleotide sequencing of the HA gene and direct amino acid sequencing showed that
insertion of a single leucine into the fusion peptide of the HA2 chain close to
the cleavage site and a shift of the cleavage site toward the C terminus by one
amino acid were responsible for the changes in the biological properties of the
thermolysin activation mutants. Revertants could be obtained when trypsin or
trypsin-like endoproteases were present in the virus-producing system.
