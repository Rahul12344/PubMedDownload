Substance abuse still remains one of the major problems in the world today, with 
millions of people abusing legal and illegal drugs. In addition, a billion people
may also be infected with one or more infections. Both drugs of abuse and
infections are associated with enormous burden of social, economic, and health
consequences. This article briefly discusses a few medical consequences of drugs 
of abuse and infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, 
psychiatric complications in hepatitis C infection, pharmacokinetic drug-drug
interactions among medications used in the treatment of addiction and infections,
and new drugs in development for the treatment of infections. Research is
encouraged to study interactions between infections, drugs of abuse, and
underlying pathophysiologic and molecular/genetic mechanisms of these
interactions.
