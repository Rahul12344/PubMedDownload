A healthy-looking 44-year-old female was admitted to our hospital complaining of 
fever and hemosputum. The chest roentgenogram on admission showed patchy
infiltrates of the segment 3 and 8 of the right lung. Laboratory studies showed a
leukocyte count of 9700/microliters, erythrocytes sedimentation rate of 55
mm/hour and C reactive protein of 8.7 mg/dl. The arterial PO2 was 71.9 torr while
the patient was breathing room air. Transtracheal aspiration was performed on
admission, and strains and culture for bacteria, acid fast bacilli, fungi and
mycoplasma were negative. Respiratory syncytial virus was isolated from
transtracheal aspirates. The RSV complement fixing antibody titers rose from 1:40
to 1:16. She became afebrile on the fourth day after admission and her chest
roentgenogram improved gradually. RSV infection should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of atypical adult pneumonias.
