To dissect the host RNA silencing response incited by citrus tristeza virus (CTV,
genus Closterovirus), a (+) ssRNA of ~19300 nt, and the counter reaction deployed
by the virus via its three RNA silencing suppressors (RSS), the small RNAs
(sRNAs) of three virus-host combinations were deep sequenced. The subsequent
analysis indicated that CTV sRNAs (1) constitute more than half of the total
sRNAs in the susceptible Mexican lime and sweet orange, while only 3.5% in the
restrictive sour orange; (2) are mostly of 21-22 nt, with those of (+) sense
predominating slightly; and (3) derive from all the CTV genome, as evidenced by
its entire recomposition from viral sRNA contigs but adopt an asymmetric pattern 
with a hotspot mapping at the 3'-terminal ~2500 nt. The citrus homologues of
Arabidopsis Dicer-like (DCL) 4 and 2 most likely generate the 21 and 22 nt CTV
sRNAs, respectively, by dicing the gRNA and the 3' co-terminal sgRNAs and,
particularly, their double-stranded forms accumulating in infected cells. The
plant sRNA profile, very similar and dominated by the 24 nt sRNAs in the three
mock-inoculated controls, displayed a major reduction of the 24 nt sRNAs in
Mexican lime and sweet orange, but not in sour orange. CTV infection also
influences the levels of certain microRNAs.The high accumulation of CTV sRNAs in 
two of the citrus hosts examined suggests that it is not their synthesis, but
their function, the target of the RSS encoded by CTV: p25 (intercellular), p23
(intracellular) and p20 (both). The two latter might block the loading of CTV
sRNAs into the RNA silencing complex or interfere with it through alternative
mechanisms. Of the three CTV RSS, p23 is the one that has been more thoroughly
studied. It is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein with a putative Zn finger
domain and basic motifs that (1) has no homologues in other closteroviruses, (2) 
accumulates in the nucleolus and plasmodesmata, (3) regulates the asymmetric
balance of CTV (+) and (-) RNA strands, and (4) induces CTV syndromes and
stimulates systemic infection in certain citrus species when expressed as a
transgene ectopically or in phloem-associated cells.
