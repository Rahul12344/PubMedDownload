As a typical protein nanostructure, virus-based nanoparticle (VNP) of simian
virus 40 (SV40), which is composed of pentamers of the major capsid protein of
SV40 (VP1), has been successfully employed in guiding the assembly of different
nanoparticles (NPs) into predesigned nanostructures with considerable stability. 
However, the stabilization mechanism of SV40 VNP remains unclear. Here, the
importance of inter-pentamer disulfide bonds between cysteines in the
stabilization of quantum dot (QD)-containing VNPs (VNP-QDs) is comprehensively
investigated by constructing a series of VP1 mutants of cysteine to serine.
Although the presence of a QD core can greatly enhance the assembly and stability
of SV40 VNPs, disulfide bonds are vital to stability of VNP-QDs. Cysteine at
position 9 (C9) and C104 contribute most of the disulfide bonds and play
essential roles in determining the stability of SV40 VNPs as templates to guide
assembly of complex nanoarchitectures. These results provide insightful clues to 
understanding the robustness of SV40 VNPs in organizing suprastructures of
inorganic NPs. It is expected that these findings will help guide the future
design and construction of protein-based functional nanostructures.
