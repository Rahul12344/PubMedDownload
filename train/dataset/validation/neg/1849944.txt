We have been looking for urethral condylomatous lesions during a screening
genital examination of 2,000 male patients who were the partners of women
presenting with a condylomatous infection. The use of a small speculum and of a
retractor of our own design has allowed the out patient diagnosis and treatment
of urethral lesions up to 20 mm deep in 26 (22%) of the 123 patients presenting
with lesions of the urethral meatus. A follow-up urethroscopy demonstrated the
presence of condylomatous lesions in the retrobalanic portion, up to the vicinity
of the striated sphincter in 11 (8%) of these patients. The use of a novel
retractor thus allows visualizing all the lesions located up to the great lacuna 
and treating them with a laser beam, with a healing rate of 93%. Urethroscopy
must be reserved for recurrence of meatic condylomas after treatment.
