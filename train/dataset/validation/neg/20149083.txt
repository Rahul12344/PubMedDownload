AIMS: The anti-enterovirus 71 (EV71) activity of six Nepalese plants' extracts
and gallic acid (GA) isolated from Woodfordia fruticosa Kurz (family; Lythaceae) 
flowers were evaluated in Vero cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The anti-EV71 activity of tested compounds was evaluated by 
a cytopathic effect reduction method. Our results demonstrated that flowers'
extracts of W. fruticosa exerted strong anti-EV71 activity, with a 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC(50)) of 1.2 microg ml(-1) and no cytotoxicity at a
concentration of 100 microg ml(-1), and the derived therapeutic index (TI) was
more than 83.33. Rivabirin showed no antiviral activity against EV71.
Furthermore, GA isolated from W. fruticosa flowers exhibited a higher anti-EV71
activity than the extract of W. fruticosa flowers, with an IC(50) of 0.76 microg 
ml(-1) and no cytotoxicity at a concentration of 100 microg ml(-1), and the
derived TI was 99.57.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that flower extracts of W. fruticosa
possessed anti-EV71 activity and GA isolated from these flowers showed stronger
anti-EV71 activity than that the extracts.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results suggest that the GA from W.
fruticosa flowers may be used as a potential antiviral agent.
