Vpu is an 81 amino acid type I integral membrane protein encoded by human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It is identified to support viral release 
by potentially forming ion and substrate conducting channels and by modulating
the function of host factors. The focus is on the interaction of the
transmembrane domains of Vpu with those of host factors using a combination of
molecular dynamics simulations and docking approach. Binding poses and adopted
tilt angles of the dimers are analyzed and correlated with experimentally derived
activity data from literature. Vpu activity is driven by dimerization with the
host protein via its alanine rim Ala-8/11/15/19. Tight binding is shown by an
almost parallel alignment of the helices in the dimers. Less parallel alignment
is proposed to correlate with lower activity. This article is part of a Special
Issue entitled: Viral Membrane Proteins - Channels for Cellular Networking.
