The inhibitory activities of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase
(HIV-RT) inhibitors PFA and Suramin against HIV-RT and equine infectious anemic
virus reverse transcriptase (EIAV-RT) were studied in this paper. The 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of HIV-RT and EIAV-RT treated by PFA and Suramin 
were 0.2 mumol, 9.8 mumol and 17 mumol, 19.9 mumol, respectively. More than
thirty Chinese medicines, including recipes, herbs, extracts of traditional
materia medica and isolated compounds were tested using HIV-RT and EIAV-RT as
target enzymes. It was found that 5 crude extracts such as Rhizoma Polygoni
Cuspidati, and Radix Notoginseng, 7 isolated compounds like Flavone of Ramulus
Visci, Flavone of Ajuga Decumbens Thumb, and Aristolochic acid, as well as the
extract of the complex prescription Xiao Chai Hu Tang have shown various
inhibitory actions on these two enzymes. The activities of the two enzymes were
comparable, but HIV-RT was more sensitive, suggesting that HIV-RT can be used as 
index for the screening of anti-aids drugs.
