Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and
CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems are key immune mechanisms helping prokaryotic
species fend off RNA and DNA viruses. CRISPR/Cas9 has broad applications in basic
research and biotechnology and has been widely used across eukaryotic species for
genome engineering and functional analysis of genes. The recently developed
CRISPR/Cas13 systems target RNA rather than DNA and thus offer new potential for 
transcriptome engineering and combatting RNA viruses. Here, we used
CRISPR/LshCas13a to stably engineer Arabidopsis thaliana for interference against
the RNA genome of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Our data demonstrate that CRISPR
RNAs (crRNAs) guiding Cas13a to the sequences encoding helper component
proteinase silencing suppressor (HC-Pro) or GFP target 2 (GFP-T2) provide better 
interference compared to crRNAs targeting other regions of the TuMV RNA genome.
This work demonstrates the exciting potential of CRISPR/Cas13 to be used as an
antiviral strategy to obstruct RNA viruses, and encourages the search for more
robust and effective Cas13 variants or CRISPR systems that can target RNA.
