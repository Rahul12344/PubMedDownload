BACKGROUND: The number of people newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) has been decreasing in sub-Saharan Africa, but prevalence of the infection 
remains unacceptably high among young people. Despite the alarming pervasiveness 
of the virus, young people in this region continue to engage in risky sexual
behaviors including unprotected sexual intercourse. In developed countries,
parents can play important roles in protecting young people from such behaviors, 
but evidence regarding the impact of parental involvement is still limited in
sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we conducted this study to examine the magnitude
of risky sexual behaviors and the association of parental monitoring and parental
communication with condom use at last sexual intercourse among secondary school
students in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional study among 2,217 male and female
students aged 15 to 24 years from 12 secondary schools in Dar es Salaam. From
October to November 2011, we collected data using a self-administered
questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine
the association of parental monitoring and parental communication with condom use
at last sexual intercourse, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 665 (30.3%) secondary school students reported being sexually
active within the year prior to data collection. Among them, 41.7% had multiple
sexual partners, 10.5% had concurrent sexual partners, and 41.1% did not use a
condom at last sexual intercourse. A higher level of parental monitoring was
associated with increased likelihood of condom use at last sexual intercourse
among male students (AOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.05-2.32; p = 0.03) but not among female
students (AOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.71-3.37; p = 0.28). The association between
parental communication and condom use at last sexual intercourse among both male 
and female students was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: A high level of parental monitoring is associated with more
consistent condom use among male students in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania -- many of
whom have engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors such as multiple sexual
partnerships, concurrent sexual partnerships, and unprotected sexual intercourse 
in the past one year. Interventions should thus be strengthened to reduce
multiple sexual partnerships, concurrent sexual partnerships, and to improve
parental monitoring among such students toward increasing condom use.
