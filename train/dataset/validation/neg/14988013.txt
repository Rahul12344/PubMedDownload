The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been one of the most epidemic
diseases threatening human health all over the world. Based on clinical studies, 
SARS-CoV (the SARS-associated coronavirus), a novel coronavirus, is reported as
the pathogen responsible for the disease. To date, no effective and specific
therapeutic method can be used to treat patients suffering from SARS-CoV
infection. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which the introduced small
interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause the degradation of mRNA with identical
sequence specificity. The RNAi methodology has been used as a tool to silence
genes in cultured cells and in animals. Recently, this technique was employed in 
anti-virus infections in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C/B virus. In
this study, RNAi technology has been applied to explore the possibility for
prevention of SARS-CoV infection. We constructed specific siRNAs targeting the S 
gene in SARS-CoV. We demonstrated that the siRNAs could effectively and
specifically inhibit gene expression of Spike protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells.
Our study provided evidence that RNAi could be a tool for inhibition of SARS-CoV.
