Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) type II is a disorder characterized by circulating
cold-precipitable immune complexes composed of polyclonal immunoglobulin IgG and 
monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor (RF). The systemic vasculitis which
characterizes the disease is caused by the deposition of immune complexes on the 
walls of small vessels, and by the subsequent activation of the complement
cascade. MC may be asymptomatic or lead to clinical manifestations characterized 
by a typical triad--purpura, arthralgia, and weakness--and in some cases by a
more serious vasculitis with neurologic and renal involvement. In the vast
majority (more than 90%) of patients, MC is associated with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection, which is considered the triggering factor of the disease. The
association between cryoglobulinemia and HCV infection, and the possible
evolution to B-cell lymphomas usually after long-term follow-up, suggest the role
of HCV infection both in the pathogenesis of MC and in lymphomagenesis. In fact, 
the virus chronically stimulates the polyclonal proliferation of B cells from
which a monoclonal population may emerge. This paper also reviews the treatment
strategies for MC syndrome, emphasizing the issue of the eradication of HCV, and 
the clinical and biological activity of rituximab for selective B-cell control.
