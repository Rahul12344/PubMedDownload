Detection of novel murine mammary tumor viruses by interspecies immunoassays.

Teramoto YA, Hand PH, Callahan R, Schlom J.

Radioimmunoassays were developed that can detect antigenic determinants common to
mammary tumor viruses (MTV's) of four distinct Mus species: M. musculus, M.
cervicolor, M. cookll, and M. caroll. The radioimmunoassays were based on the
immunologic cross-reactivity observed between the murine mammary tumor viruses
(MuMTV) of M. musculus and type B retrovirus isolated from M. cervicolor. Both of
the glycoproteins of MuMTV (gp52, gp36) shared antigenic determinants with
virions of M. cervicolor mammary tumor virus. Interspecies radioimmunoassays for 
gp52 and gp36 were developed and used to detect viruses in the milk of noninbred 
feral Mus species and MuMTV-related translational products in mammary tumors in
these species. Type C and type D retroviruses, as well as the M432 retrovirus of 
M. cervicolor, did not react in either assay. Both interspecies immunoassays were
therefore specific for the detection of distinct MuMTV-related antigenic
determinants.
