Large amounts of RNA and RNP isolated from influenza virus were obtained. This
has allowed us to undertake detailed physical studies of the secondary structure 
of RNA of influenza virus in free form and in RNP. Analysis of CD spectrum and
the hypochromic effect after thermal denaturation of RNA indicated that RNA in
free form contains 58--62% double-stranded regions. By comparative studies of the
secondary structure of RNA in RNP, it was estimated that 12--14% of the RNA
exists in double-stranded form.
