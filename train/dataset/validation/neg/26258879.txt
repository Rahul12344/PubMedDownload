The production of high affinity, class switched antibodies produced by B cells
hinges on the effective differentiation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Here 
we define conditions specifically enhancing Tfh differentiation and providing
protection in a model of influenza infection. Tfh responses were associated with 
prolonged antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs), which maintained T
cell/DC interactions into stage 3 (&gt;72 hr) of activation. Blocking stage 3
interactions ablated Tfh generation, demonstrating a causal link between T
cell-DC behaviour and functional outcomes. The current data therefore explain how
duration of antigen presentation affects the dynamics of T cell-DC interactions
and consequently determine Tfh cell differentiation in the developing immune
response.
