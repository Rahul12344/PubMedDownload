Infectious bronchitis and mixed infections of Mycoplasma synoviae and Escherichia
coli in gnotobiotic chickens. I. Synergistic role in the airsacculitis syndrome.

Springer WT, Luskus C, Pourciau SS.

The synergistic role of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and mixed infections of
Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) and Escherichia coli (EC) in the airsacculitis syndrome 
was evaluated in gnotobiotic chickens. Relative air sac lesion score indexes, in 
descending order of severity, from various combinations of organisms were:
9.5-IBV, MS, EC; 6.8-IBV, EC; 4.5-IBV, MS; 2.7-IBV; and 0.5-MS, EC. Infectious
bronchitis virus caused a mild fibrinous inflammation. M. synoviae combined with 
IBV increased heterophilic and follicular lymphoid infiltration and mortality. E.
coli combined with IBV increased exudation and prolonged airsacculitis.
Concentrations of fibrinogen, gamma globulin, and total plasma proteins were
elevated significantly by combined infections of IBV, MS, and EC (P < 0.01).
