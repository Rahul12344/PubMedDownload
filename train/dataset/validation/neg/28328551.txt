BACKGROUND: A low proportion of CD28CD8 T cells that express CD57 is associated
with increased mortality in HIV infection. The effect of increasing body mass
index (BMI) changes in the proportion of CD57CD28CD8 T cells among HIV-infected
individuals on antiretroviral therapy is unknown.
SETTING: In a US cohort of HIV-infected women, we evaluated associations of BMI
and waist circumference with 3 distinct CD8 T cell phenotypes: % CD28CD57CD8 T
cells, % CD57 of CD28CD8 T cells, and % CD28 of all CD8 T cells.
METHODS: Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to estimate beta
coefficients for each of 3 T-cell phenotypes. Covariates included HIV parameters 
(current and nadir CD4, current viral load), demographics (age, race, income, and
study site), and lifestyle (tobacco and alcohol use) factors.
RESULTS: Of 225 participants, the median age was 46 years and 50% were obese (BMI
>30 m/kg). Greater BMI and waist circumference were both associated with higher %
CD28CD57CD8 T cells and % CD57 of all CD28CD8 T cells in multivariable analysis, 
including adjustment for HIV viral load (all P < 0.05). The association between
greater BMI and the overall proportion of CD28 CD8 cells in fully adjusted models
(0.078, 95% confidence interval: -0.053 to 0.209) was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, greater BMI and waist circumference are associated
with greater expression of CD57 on CD28CD8 T cells and a greater proportion of
CD57CD28 CD8 T cells. These findings may indicate that increasing BMI is
immunologically protective in HIV-infected women. Future research is needed to
understand the prognostic importance of these associations on clinical outcomes.
