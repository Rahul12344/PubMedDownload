A cluster of four cases of symptomatic B virus infection in humans occurred in
Pensacola, Florida, in March 1987. Three cases occurred in persons who worked
with monkeys at a research facility, and the fourth resulted from apparent
autoinoculation through use of a nonprescription skin cream. Contact tracing
identified 159 persons who may have been exposed to B virus (21 had been exposed 
to monkeys at the facility and 138 had been exposed to one or more of the
case-patients), but no further cases were identified. Comparisons of restriction 
endonuclease patterns from B virus isolates linked two of the three cases in
monkey handlers to one clinically ill monkey and the other to a second, healthy
monkey. Three risk factors for human infection were identified: nonuse of
mechanical or chemical restraints for monkeys before handling, nonuse of
available protective gear, and direct viral inoculation through the application
of a topical medication.
