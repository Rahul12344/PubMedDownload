Laboratories in low-income countries report that acid-fast microscopy is
insensitive and nonspecific. We demonstrate that for a Ugandan population with
high prevalences of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus infection,
acid-fast microscopy is highly sensitive (93.1%) and specific (100%) when
performed by trained technologists in a carefully controlled manner using
established techniques.
