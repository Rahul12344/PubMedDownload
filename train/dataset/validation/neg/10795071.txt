The course of human immunodeficiency virus infection and the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome can be complicated by a variety of endocrine
abnormalities. This article describes the findings of a prospective autopsy study
of the thyroid in 100 patients who died of complications of AIDS before the
advent of the so-called highly active antiretroviral therapy [corrected]. A wide 
range of bacterial, fungal, viral, and neoplastic disorders were observed.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was recorded in 23% of the patients, cytomegalovirus
in 17%, Cryptococcus in 5%, Mycobacterium avium in 5%, Pneumocystis in 4%, and
other bacteria or fungi in 7%. Kaposi's sarcoma was recorded in 2% of patients
and occult papillary carcinoma in 4%. Four patients had dual infections of the
thyroid. The mean weight of the thyroid was lower than normal, and 1 case of
thyroid follicular atrophy is presented. A review of the medical literature on
thyroid disorders in HIV-infected patients is included. Physicians caring for HIV
patients should be aware of the possibility of thyroid dysfunction in their
patients.
