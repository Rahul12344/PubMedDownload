A case of primary infection by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) variant A in a
54-year-old woman, which occurred at the same time as the onset of
encephalomyelitis, is reported. The correlation between the two events is
discussed. It is speculated that, during the early phase of the infection, the
HHV-6 spread to the central nervous system and triggered a pathogenic process
that initially developed without symptoms. When the neurological disorders
appeared, HHV-6 had already established a latent state: only the virus carried by
infected blood cells was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.
