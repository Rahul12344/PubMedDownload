Triatoma virus (TrV) is a viral pathogen of the blood-sucking reduviid bug
Triatoma infestans, the most important vector of American human trypanosomiasis
(Chagas' disease). TrV has been putatively classified as a member of the
Cripavirus genus (type cricket paralysis virus) in the Dicistroviridae family.
This work describes the purification of TrV particles from infected T. infestans 
and their crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analyses. Two
different crystal forms, rhombohedral and orthorhombic, were obtained at room
temperature by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique using polyethylene
glycol and polyethylene glycol monomethylether as precipitants. The rhombohedral 
crystals have unit-cell parameters a = b = 306.6, c = 788.4 A (hexagonal
setting), diffract to 3.2 A resolution and contain one-third of the viral
particle per asymmetric unit. The orthorhombic crystals have cell parameters a = 
336, b = 351, c = 332 A, diffract to about 2.5 A resolution, and contain one-half
of a virus particle in the asymmetric unit. A complete diffraction data set has
been collected to 3.2 A resolution, using synchrotron radiation, from a single
rhombohedral crystal under cryogenic conditions.
