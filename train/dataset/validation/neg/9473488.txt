Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is associated with adult
T-cell leukemia and HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.
Inhibition of HTLV-1 transmission is important to prevent the above
HTLV-1-associated diseases. We used the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) 
complementary to the first splice junction, rex responsive site, gag, env, tax,
rex, and p21 and evaluated the effects on the syncytium formation between HTLV-1 
producing human T-cell line, C9/PL cells, and HTLV-1-uninfected human glioma cell
line, U251-MG cells. The syncytium formation was significantly inhibited the
virion production assayed by antisense oligos to env, tax, gag, p21, and rex,
with antisense oligo to env being the most inhibitory. Antisense oligos to env
and tax also inhibited reverse transcriptase activity. Antisense oligo to env may
have a potential as a preventive measure of HTLV-1 replication and transmission
in vivo.
