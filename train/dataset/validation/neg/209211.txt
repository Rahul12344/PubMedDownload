Detection of proviral DNA in horse cells infected with equine infectious anemia
virus.

Rice NR, Simek S, Ryder OA, Coggins L.

Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) recently has been shown to possess a
high-molecular-weight RNA genome and a virion reverse transcriptase. We completed
the demonstration that EIAV is a retrovirus by showing the presence of proviral
DNA in equine cells infected in vitro, but not in normal horse DNA. These studies
were performed by using a highly representative cDNA probe synthesized by the
virion polymerase. It was found that this cDNA reassociated extensively, and with
high thermal stability, with either viral RNA or DNA extracted from infected
cells, but showed no detectable reassociation with DNA from uninfected horse
cells. Similarly, sequences related to EIAV were neither found in the DNA of four
other Equus species, nor in a variety of other mammals including sheep, cows,
pigs- dogs, cats, and humans; nor did EIAV cDNA hybridize with a variety of other
retrovirus RNAs. These experiments were performed under conditions of very low
stringency to enable detection of distantly related sequences, with a sufficient 
ratio of DAN to cDNA to allow detection of less than one viral copy per haploid
genome. We conclude that EIAV is not an endogenous virus of the horse or of the
other species tested.
