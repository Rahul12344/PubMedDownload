Spontaneous pneumothorax is a known complication of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To evaluate
the possible pathogenesis and natural history of pneumothorax in patients
receiving aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis, we retrospectively reviewed 327
outpatients positive for human immunodeficiency virus receiving aerosolized
pentamidine. There were 12 spontaneous pneumothoraces in this group of patients. 
Seventy-five percent of patients with pneumothorax had roentgenographic evidence 
of fibrocystic lung parenchyma and clinical evidence of active Pneumocystis
pneumonia. The majority (83%) required chest tube evacuation. There was a 50%
mortality rate associated with this complication. These findings suggest that
spontaneous pneumothorax in patients treated with aerosolized pentamidine most
commonly represents a prophylaxis failure associated with a high mortality rate.
