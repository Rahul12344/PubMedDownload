Translational cancer research has benefitted significantly from the generation of
preclinical models that recapitulate the native tumour environment. While
conventional cell models have contributed substantially to the current
understanding of cancer biology and therapeutic development, a missing link
between cell culture and their clinical applications is evident. Patient derived 
xenograft (PDX) models represent this missing link as they enable the examination
of patient tumour tissue in a native environment without significantly affecting 
the cellular complexity, genomics, and stromal architecture of the neoplasms. The
use of PDXs to model head and neck cancer (HNC) begets the development of novel
therapeutics, increased understanding of tumorigenesis and the advent of
personalised treatments cancer patients. There has been an increase in attempts
to generate viable PDXs for HNCs in recent years. This concise review summarizes 
the current developments in the field of PDXs for HNCs.
