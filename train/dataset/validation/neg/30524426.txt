Current vaccine development disregards human immune ontogeny, relying on animal
models to select vaccine candidates targeting human infants, who are at greatest 
risk of infection worldwide, and receive the largest number of vaccines. To help 
accelerate and de-risk development of early-life effective immunization, we
engineered a human age-specific microphysiologic vascular-interstitial
interphase, suitable for pre-clinical modeling of distinct age-targeted immunity 
in vitro. Our Tissue Constructs (TCs) enable autonomous extravasation of
monocytes that undergo rapid self-directed differentiation into migratory
Dendritic Cells (DCs) in response to adjuvants and licensed vaccines such as
Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or Hepatitis B virus Vaccine (HBV). TCs contain a
confluent human endothelium grown atop a tri-dimensional human extracellular
matrix substrate, employ human age-specific monocytes and autologous non
heat-treated plasma, and avoid the use of xenogenic materials and exogenous
cytokines. Vaccine-pulsed TCs autonomously generated DCs that induced
single-antigen recall responses from autologous naïve and memory CD4+ T
lymphocytes, matching study participant immune-status, including BCG responses
paralleling donor PPD status, BCG-induced adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity
paralleling infant cohorts in vivo, and multi-dose HBV antigen-specific responses
as demonstrated by lymphoproliferation and TCR sequencing. Overall, our
microphysiologic culture method reproduced age- and antigen-specific recall
responses to BCG and HBV immunization, closely resembling those observed after a 
birth immunization of human cohorts in vivo, offering for the first time a new
approach to early pre-clinical selection of effective age-targeted vaccine
candidates.
