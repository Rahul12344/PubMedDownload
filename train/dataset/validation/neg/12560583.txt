The genetic diversity of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL) was investigated by
comparing 24 ABL isolate glycoprotein (G) gene nucleotide sequences with those of
37 lyssaviruses representing Lyssavirus genotypes 1-6. Phylogenetic analyses
indicated that ABL forms a monophyletic group separate from other lyssaviruses.
This group differentiates into two clades: one associated with Pteropus (flying
fox) species, the other with the insectivorous bat Saccolaimus flaviventris.
Calculation of percentage nucleotide identities between isolates of the two
clades revealed up to 18.7 % nucleotide sequence divergence between the two ABL
variants. These observations suggest that ABL is a separate lyssavirus species
with a similar epidemiology to chiropteran rabies virus (RV), where two distinct 
ABL variants co-exist in Australia in bat species with dissimilar ecology.
Analyses of selection pressures in ABL G gene sequences provided some evidence of
weak positive selection within the endodomain at amino acids 499 and 501,
although in general the dominant evolutionary process observed was purifying
selection. This intimates that, in nature, isolates of ABL, like those of RV, are
subject to relatively strong selective constraints, suggesting a stability of
host species, cell tropisms and ecological conditions.
