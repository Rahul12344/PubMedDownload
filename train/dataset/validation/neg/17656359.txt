Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers consisting of tubulin subunits that take
part in diverse cell activities. Many viruses hijack cellular motor proteins to
move on microtubules toward the cell interior during the entry process and toward
the plasma membrane during the egress period. In addition, viruses often remodel 
microtubules to facilitate the generation of infectious progeny. In this study,
we found that the transactivator of transcription protein of Jembrana disease
virus (Jtat) bound tubulin and microtubules both in cells and in the purified
system. Microtubule co-sedimentation and co-localization assays revealed a robust
interaction of Jtat with microtubules. Tubulin turbidity assay further showed
that Jtat promoted tubulin polymerization in vitro in a concentration-dependent
manner. Moreover, Jtat promoted the partitioning of cellular tubulin toward the
polymeric form, increased the level of tubulin acetylation, and significantly
enhanced the cold stability of cellular microtubules. In addition, Jtat-mediated 
disruption of microtubule dynamics induced the release of Bim from microtubules, 
leading to profound apoptosis. These results not only identify Jtat as an
important viral regulator of microtubule dynamics but also indicate that
Jtat-induced apoptosis might contribute to Jembrana disease pathogenesis.
