We present a practical description of polyethylene glycol mediated spheroplast
transformation of Halobacterium halobium and Halobacterium volcanii. This method 
has been applied to phage DNA transfection, plasmid DNA transformation, and
transformation with linear fragments of high molecular weight genomic DNA.
Efficient spheroplast regeneration allows uncomplicated recovery of transformed
progeny. Transformations can be performed equally well using fresh or frozen cell
preparations. These methods should find application in molecular cloning, genetic
fine mapping, and strain construction.
