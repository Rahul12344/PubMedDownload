To increase our understanding of the consequences of dengue virus infection
during pregnancy, a retrospective analysis was performed on the medical records
of all completed pregnancies (live births and pregnancy losses) at nine public
hospitals in the Gulf of Mexico from January to October 2013. Eighty-two patients
developed clinical, laboratory-confirmed dengue virus infections while pregnant. 
Of these, 54 (65.9%) patients were diagnosed with dengue without warning signs,
15 (18.3%) patients were diagnosed with dengue with warning signs, and 13 (15.9%)
patients had severe dengue. Five (38.5%) patients with severe dengue experienced 
fetal distress and underwent emergency cesarean sections. Four patients delivered
apparently healthy infants of normal birthweight while the remaining patient
delivered a premature infant of low birthweight. Patients died of multiple organ 
failure during or within 10 days of the procedure. Severe dengue was also
associated with obstetric hemorrhage (30.8%, four cases), preeclampsia (15.4%,
two cases), and eclampsia (7.7%, one case). These complications were less common 
or absent in patients in the other two disease categories. Additionally,
nonsevere dengue was not associated with maternal mortality, fetal distress, or
adverse neonatal outcomes. In summary, the study provides evidence that severe
dengue during pregnancy is associated with a high rate of fetal distress,
cesarean delivery, and maternal mortality.
