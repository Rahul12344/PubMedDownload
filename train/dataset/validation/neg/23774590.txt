BACKGROUND: Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are principal pericellular 
and extracellular components that form regulatory milieu involving numerous
biological and pathophysiological phenomena. Diverse functions of CSPGs can be
mainly attributed to structural variability of their polysaccharide moieties,
chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAG). Comprehensive understanding of
the regulatory mechanisms for CS biosynthesis and its catabolic processes is
required in order to understand those functions.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here, we focus on recent advances in the study of enzymatic
regulatory pathways for CS biosynthesis including successive
modification/degradation, distinct CS functions, and disease phenotypes that have
been revealed by perturbation of the respective enzymes in vitro and in vivo.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Fine-tuned machineries for CS production/degradation are
crucial for the functional expression of CS chains in developmental and
pathophysiological processes.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Control of enzymes responsible for CS
biosynthesis/catabolism is a potential target for therapeutic intervention for
the CS-associated disorders.
