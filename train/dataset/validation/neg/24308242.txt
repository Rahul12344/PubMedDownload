The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a zoonotic arbovirus that has recently been causing 
outbreaks in many countries in southern and Central Europe. In 2012, for the
first time, it caused an outbreak in eastern Croatia with total of 7 human
clinical cases. With an aim of assisting public health personnel in order to
improve survey protocols and vector control, the high risk areas of the WNV
transmission were estimated and mapped. The study area included cities of Osijek 
and Slavonski Brod and 8 municipalities in Vukovarsko-Srijemska County. Risk
estimation was based on seroprevalence of WNV infections in horses as an
indicator of the virus presence, as well as the presence of possible WNV mosquito
vectors with corresponding vector competences. Four mosquito species considered
as possible WNV vectors are included in this study: Aedes vexans, Culex modestus,
Culex pipiens and Ochlerotatus caspius. Mosquitoes were sampled using dry-ice
baited CDC trap, twice a month, between May and October. This study suggests that
the two mosquito species present the main risk of WNV transmission in eastern
Croatia: the Culex pipiens--because of good vector competence and the Aedes
vexans--because of the very high abundances. As a result, these two species
should be focus of future mosquito surveillance and a vector control management.
