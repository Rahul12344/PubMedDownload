The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, is the most important managed pollinator
globally and has recently experienced unsustainably high colony losses.
Synergistic interactions among stressors are believed to be primarily
responsible. However, despite clear evidence of strong effect on honeybee
longevity of widely-employed neonicotinoid insecticides and of the ubiquitous
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, no data exist to show synergistic effects
between these two stressors. Even though neonicotinoids had no significant impact
by themselves, we here show for the first time a synergistic time-lag interaction
between mites and neonicotinoids that resulted in significantly reduced survival 
of long-lived winter honeybees. Even though these mites are potent vectors of
viruses, the virus-insecticide interaction had no significant impact. The data
suggest a previously overlooked mechanism possibly explaining recent
unsustainably high losses of managed A. mellifera honeybee colonies in many
regions of the world. Future mitigation efforts should concentrate on developing 
sustainable agro-ecosystem management schemes that incorporate reduced use of
neonicotinoids and sustainable solutions for V. destructor mites.
