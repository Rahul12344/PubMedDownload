Virus-like particles have been isolated from the oviducts of a parasitoid wasp,
Hyposoter exiguae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Particles are readily purified by
centrifugation on either Ficoll or sucrose gradients. Double-stranded circular
DNA isolated from purified particles is heterodisperse in terms of molecular
weight; none of the molecules are sufficiently large to code for the aggregate of
structural proteins comprising the particles. Preliminary Southern blot
hybridization data suggest that there is minimal sequence homology between the
different size classes of DNA examined.
