The papillary squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a rare variant of the head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma. Established etiological factors can include tobacco
smoking and heavy alcohol abuse. Moreover, human papillomavirus infection can be 
involved in the pathogenesis of PSCC. This tumor is more frequent in patients
with immunosuppression including those who have received a transplant. Most of
the cases are produced by genotype HPV-6 and HPV-16, although there is a
possibility of infection by other HPV subtypes. We present a case report of a
PSCC and papilloma with oropharyngeal location in which high-risk HPV type 16 and
low-risk HPV type 6, respectively, were identified by PCR in a renal transplant
patient.
