OBJECTIVE: In view of the possible implication of various environmental factors
in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), the role of appendectomy 
in patients with PBC and other chronic liver diseases from Central Greece was
investigated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical files of 68 patients with PBC and gender- and
age-matched controls with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (n=65) and
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (n=67) were reviewed for the history
and time of appendectomy.
RESULTS: Nineteen of 68 (27.9%) PBC patients, 32 of 65 (49.2%) patients with
chronic HCV infection and 22 of 67 (32.8%) patients with chronic HBV infection
had a history of appendectomy. There was a significant higher frequency of
appendectomy in patients with chronic hepatitis C (p = 0.012, chi(2) test)
compared to patients with PBC. There were no significant differences in the
clinical and histological characteristics of PBC patients with or without a
history of appendectomy.
CONCLUSION: In this case-control study we were unable to provide evidence of an
association between primary biliary cirrhosis and the occurrence of appendectomy.
