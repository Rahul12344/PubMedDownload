Peripheral blood lymphocytes and B-cells were obtained from patients with
myasthenia gravis and stimulated in vitro with either pokeweed mitogen or
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), respectively. EBV stimulation of B-cells caused a
production of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor in 15 of the 25 myasthenia
gravis patients: the EBV stimulation of B-cells was more effective in this regard
than the pokeweed mitogen stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The in
vitro synthesis of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies was found to be
positively correlated with both the patients' sera antibody titers and with the
disease severity.
