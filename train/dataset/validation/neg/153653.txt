Seven hundred sixteen blood serum specimens from residents of presumable foci of 
phlebotomus fevers in Turkmenia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldavia
were examined by the neutralization, complement fixation,
hemagglutionation-inhibition and indirect immunofluorescence tests for the
presence of antibody to viruses of the group of phlebotomus fevers (Sicilyan,
Neapolitan, and Karimabad) and to rhabdovirus isfahan transmitted by phlebotomus 
papatasi. For the first time, antibody to Karimabad and Isfahan viruses were
found in residents of the Central Asian republics. Antibody to Sicilyan and
Neapolitan fevers were found in residents of all the republics examined. Data
have been obtained indicating probable pathogenicity of Isfahan virus for man.
