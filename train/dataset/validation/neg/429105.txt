Distance constraints on macromolecular conformation.

Crippen GM.

Many physico-chemical studies are made on proteins to determine something of
their solution conformation. For example the coat protein of Tobacco Mosaic Virus
has been subjected to more non-crystallographic experimental studies to determine
its native conformation than perhaps any other protein. Yet the sum of the
experimentally determined constraints on its tertiary structure are surprisingly 
inadequate to fix its conformation. We are able to detect and remove minor
inconsistencies in the data and then calculate a sampling of conformations
consistent with all the data, which differ among themselves by r.m.s. deviations 
of the respective interresidue distances ranging from 5.7 angstrom to 15.8
angstrom. Some individual interresidue distances differ by as much as 50 angstrom
from structure to structure. In order to restrict the range of possible
conformations to something corresponding to the errors in a 10 angstrom
resolution X-ray crystal structure, chemical and spectroscopic studies will have 
to be much more detailed than anything done to date. Our calculations appear to
be useful in deciding which further experiments would be most productive.
