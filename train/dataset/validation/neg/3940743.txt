The combination of a modified Staphylococci binding assay for immune complexes
and Western blot analysis is described for the isolation and detection of antigen
in immune complexes from human sera. The strategy of the procedure is to preclear
immune complexes from other serum components by sequential polyethylene glycol
precipitation and incubation with insoluble protein A under conditions in which
immune complexes are preferentially bound. Immune complexes are eluted from
protein A in sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and dissociated by acrylamide
electrophoresis. Resolved proteins are then transblotted to nitrocellulose, and
antigen is detected with specific antibody. Immune complexes were prepared in
vitro with an antigen (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) that focuses well on
electrophoresis and for which a potent immunologic probe (antibody) was
available. In this system, antigen could be detected when immune complexes were
present in sera in concentrations as low as 20 micrograms aggregated-IgG eq/ml,
regardless of antigen-antibody ratio. We demonstrate the detection of horse
globulin in immune complexes from a patient with acute serum sickness and
hepatitis B virus antigen in complexes from a patient with vasculitis.
