The immune system has evolved various effector cells and functions to combat
diverse infectious agents equipped with different virulence strategies. CD8 T
cells play a critical role in protective immunity to Listeria monocytogenes (Lm),
a bacterium that grows within the host cell cytosol and spreads directly into
neighboring cells. The importance of CD8 T cells during Lm infection is currently
attributed to the cytosolic niche of this organism, which allows it to evade many
aspects of immune surveillance. CTL lysis of infected cells is believed to be an 
essential protective mechanism, presumably functioning to release intracellular
bacteria, although its precise role remains to be fully defined. In this study,
we examined the contribution of perforin-mediated CTL cytolysis to protective
immunity against recombinant Lm capable of or defective in cell-cell spread. We
found that CTL cytolysis is critical for protective immunity to Lm capable of
cell-cell spread while protective immunity against spread-defective Lm is largely
independent of CTL cytolysis. These results demonstrate that an important
function of CTL cytolysis is to counter the microbial virulence strategy of
direct cell-cell spread. We propose a model that advances the current view of the
role of CTL cytolysis in immunity to intracellular pathogens.
