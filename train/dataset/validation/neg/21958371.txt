One-hundred and thirty confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) were recruited to evaluate their anti-SARS-coronavirus (CoV) antibody
status and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types in September 2006, 3 y after the
SARS outbreaks in Taiwan. Western blot assay showed that 6.9% of participants
still had anti-spike and anti-nucleocapside antibodies. A case-control study of
the association of HLA with SARS revealed that the HLA-Cw1502 and DR0301 alleles 
conferred resistance against SARS infection (p<0.05).
