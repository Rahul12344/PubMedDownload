RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities were detected in purified particles of
white clover cryptic viruses 1 and 2. The polymerases of the two viruses had
different requirements for optimum activity. Enzyme activity was dependent upon
the presence of virus particles, Mg2+, and the four ribonucleoside triphosphates,
and was insensitive to actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin, and rifampicin. The labeled
reaction products were dsRNAs as indicated by CF 11 column chromatography and by 
their ionic-strength-dependent sensitivity to hydrolysis by RNase A and
resistance to S1 nuclease. The dsRNAs synthesized in vitro had the same
electrophoretic mobilities as the corresponding viral templates.
