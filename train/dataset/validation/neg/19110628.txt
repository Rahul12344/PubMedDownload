Successful retroviral gene transfer into hematopoietic cells has been
demonstrated in a number of small and large animal models and clinical trials.
However, severe adverse events related to insertional muta-genesis in a recent
clinical trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency reinforced the need 
to develop novel retroviral vectors with improved biosafety. Improvements include
the use of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors as well as improvements in vector
design. This chapter describes the basic design of gamma-retroviral and
lentiviral SIN vectors that utilize a split-packaging system and includes a
description of the various cloning modules frequently used in the design of such 
vectors that impact biosafety, titer, and transgene expression. In addition, this
chapter describes the methods used for high titer vector production using calcium
phosphate transfection both at research scale and at large scale for clinical
application using a closed system bioreactor.
