Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious
disease caused by a tick-borne phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, SFTS virus
(SFTSV). Wild-type and type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor 1-deficient (IFNAR1-/-)
mice have been established as nonlethal and lethal models of SFTSV infection,
respectively. However, the mechanisms of IFN-I production in vivo and the factors
causing the lethal disease are not well understood. Using bone marrow-chimeric
mice, we found that IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells was essential for
survival of lethal SFTSV infection. The disruption of IFN-I signaling in
hematopoietic cells allowed an increase in viral loads in serum and produced an
excess of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The production of IFN-I
and inflammatory cytokines was abolished by deletion of the signaling molecules
IPS-1 and MyD88, essential for retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like
receptor (RLR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, respectively. However,
IPS-1-/- MyD88-/- mice exhibited resistance to lethal SFTS with a moderate viral 
load in serum. Taken together, these results indicate that adequate activation of
RLR and TLR signaling pathways under low to moderate levels of viremia
contributed to survival through the IFN-I-dependent antiviral response during
SFTSV infection, whereas overactivation of these signaling pathways under high
levels of viremia resulted in abnormal induction of multiple inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, causing the lethal disease.IMPORTANCE SFTSV causes a
severe infectious disease in humans, with a high fatality rate of 12 to 30%. To
know the pathogenesis of the virus, we need to clarify the innate immune response
as a front line of defense against viral infection. Here, we report that a lethal
animal model showed abnormal induction of multiple inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines by an uncontrolled innate immune response, which triggered the lethal 
SFTS. Our findings suggest a new strategy to target inflammatory humoral factors 
to treat patients with severe SFTS. Furthermore, this study may help the
investigation of other tick-borne viruses.
