BACKGROUND: Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) ablation may
reduce the incidence of invasive cancer, but few data exist on treatment efficacy
and natural regression without treatment.
METHODS: An open-label, randomized, multisite clinical trial of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults aged ≥27 years with 1-3
biopsy-proven anal HSILs (index HSILs) without prior history of HSIL treatment
with infrared coagulation (IRC). Participants were randomized 1:1 to HSIL
ablation with IRC (treatment) or no treatment (active monitoring [AM]).
Participants were followed every 3 months with high-resolution anoscopy.
Treatment participants underwent anal biopsies of suspected new or recurrent
HSILs. The AM participants underwent biopsies only at month 12. The primary end
point was complete clearance of index HSIL at month 12.
RESULTS: We randomized 120 participants. Complete index HSIL clearance occurred
more frequently in the treatment group than in the AM (62% vs 30%; risk
difference, 32%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13%-48%; P < .001). Complete or
partial clearance (clearance of ≥1 index HSIL) occurred more commonly in the
treatment group (82% vs 47%; risk difference, 35%; 95% CI, 16%-50%; P < .001).
Having a single index lesion, compared with having 2-3 lesions, was significantly
associated with complete clearance (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.22-3.10). The 
most common adverse events related to treatment were mild or moderate anal pain
and bleeding. No serious adverse events were deemed related to treatment or study
participation.
CONCLUSION: IRC ablation of anal HSILs results in more clearance of HSILs than
observation alone.
