STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe the implementation of a mobile pediatric emergency
response team for mildly ill children with influenza-like illnesses during the
H1N1 swine influenza outbreak.
METHODS: This was a descriptive quality improvement study conducted in the Texas 
Children's Hospital (Houston, TX) pediatric emergency department (ED), covered,
open-air parking lot from May 1, 2009, to May 7, 2009. Children aged 18 years or 
younger were screened for viral respiratory symptoms and sent to designated areas
of the ED according to level of acuity, possibility of influenza-like illness,
and the anticipated need for laboratory evaluation.
RESULTS: The mobile pediatric emergency response team experienced 18% of the
total ED volume, or a median of 48 patients daily, peaking at 83 patients treated
on May 3, 2009. Although few children had positive rapid influenza assay results 
and the morbidity of disease in the community appeared to be minimal for the
majority of children, anxiety about pandemic influenza drove a large number of ED
visits, necessitating an increase in surge capacity. Surge capacity was augmented
both through utilization of existing institutional resources and by creating a
novel area in which to treat patients with potential airborne pathogens.
Infection control procedures and patient safety were also maximized through
patient cohorting and adaptation of social distancing measures to the ED setting.
CONCLUSION: The mobile pediatric emergency response team and screening and triage
algorithms were able to safely and effectively identify a group of low-acuity
patients who could be rapidly evaluated and discharged, alleviating ED volume and
potentially preventing transmission of H1N1 influenza.
