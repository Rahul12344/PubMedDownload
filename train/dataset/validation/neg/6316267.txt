Transcription regulatory elements in the late region of bacteriophage T5 DNA.

Brunel F, Thi VH, Pilaete MF, Davison J.

Transcription promoters and terminators have been cloned from the late region of 
bacteriophage T5 DNA and their strengths determined in vivo in plasmid
derivatives. DNA sequence analysis shows these transcription signals to be
remarkable in that, in all four cases studied in detail, the promoters and
terminators overlapped or were very close together.
