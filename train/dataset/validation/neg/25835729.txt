Remarkable progress in structural biology has equipped virologists with insight
into structures of viral proteins and virions at increasingly high resolution.
Structural information has been used extensively to address fundamental questions
about virtually all aspects of how viruses replicate in cells, interact with the 
host, and in the design of antiviral compounds. However, many critical aspects of
virology exist outside the snapshots captured by traditional methods used to
generate high-resolution structures. Like all proteins, viral proteins are not
static structures. The conformational flexibility and dynamics of proteins play a
significant role in protein-protein interactions, and in the structure and
biology of virus particles. This review will discuss the implications of the
dynamics of viral proteins on the biology, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of
flaviviruses.
