An influenza A virus (H7N9) anti-neuraminidase monoclonal antibody protects mice 
from morbidity without interfering with the development of protective immunity to
subsequent homologous challenge.

The emergence of A(H7N9) virus strains with resistance to neuraminidase (NA)
inhibitors highlights a critical need to discover new countermeasures for
treatment of A(H7N9) virus-infected patients. We previously described an anti-NA 
mAb (3c10-3) that has prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mice lethally
challenged with A(H7N9) virus when delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Here we
show that intrananasal (i.n.) administration of 3c10-3 protects 100% of mice from
mortality when treated 24h post-challenge and further characterize the protective
efficacy of 3c10-3 using a nonlethal A(H7N9) challenge model. Administration of
3c10-3 i.p. 24h prior to challenge resulted in a significant decrease in viral
lung titers and deep sequencing analysis indicated that treatment did not
consistently select for viral variants in NA. Furthermore, prophylactic
administration of 3c10-3 did not inhibit the development of protective immunity
to subsequent homologous virus re-challenge. Taken together, 3c10-3 highlights
the potential use of anti-NA mAb to mitigate influenza virus infection.
