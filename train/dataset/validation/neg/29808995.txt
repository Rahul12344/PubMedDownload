By taking advantage of the spectral properties of metal carbonyls, we have
designed a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) ratiometric assay for
measuring cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) from Epstein-Barr virus in blood for 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This assay consists of a rhenium carbonyl (Re-CO)
to serve as a DNA probe, an osmium carbonyl (Os-CO) embedded within the
SERS-active substrate as an internal reference, and a streptavidin layer on the
surface of the substrate. Hybridization of cfDNA with biotinylated-capture
sequence leads to immobilization of cfDNA on the substrate. The binding of Re-CO 
via daunorubicin (DNR) to cfDNA is accompanied by an appearance of a strong
symmetry stretching vibrations peak at 2113 cm-1, which has spectral overlap with
Os-CO (2025 cm-1). This results in an increase in the I2113/ I2025 ratio and
quantitatively correlates with cfDNA. This SERS assay can be readily used to
detect cfDNA in blood samples from patients due to the intensity ratio of I2113/ 
I2025 lying in a silent region (1780-2200 cm-1) in the SERS spectrum of the
biomolecules.
