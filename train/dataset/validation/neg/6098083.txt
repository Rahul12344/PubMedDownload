Biopsy histopathology in herpes simplex encephalitis and in encephalitis of
undefined etiology.

Booss J, Kim JH.

The histopathology of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) has been described
principally from postmortem studies which reveal end-stage disease. Biopsy
material, which selects an earlier stage in disease development, has been used
principally to isolate virus, identify viral particles, and locate viral
antigens. Further, little attention has been paid to the histopathology of
biopsies of encephalitis of undefined etiology. In the present study, sections
from biopsies which yielded virus and those which were negative for virus were
evaluated in a systematic and controlled manner. Biopsies yielding virus were
characterized by meningeal inflammation, perivascular infiltrates, and glial
nodules. Biopsies which did not yield virus and which failed to reveal another
diagnosis were characterized by nonspecific gliosis. Thus the early
histiopathology of HSE is characterized by early signs of inflammation in the
absence of necrosis and generally differs from biopsies in which virus is not
isolated.
