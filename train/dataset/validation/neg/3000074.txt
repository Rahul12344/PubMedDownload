Association of the pX gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I with
nucleus.

Kiyokawa T, Kawaguchi T, Seiki M, Yoshida M.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) contains a unique gene pX coding for 
p40 chi, and this protein was suggested to activate the transcription from the
LTR of HTLV. By a similar mechanism, this viral function might be involved in
immortalization of T-cells and leukemogenesis in adult T-cell leukemia induced by
HTLV-I. In this communication, a part of the p40 chi was found to be tightly
associated with nuclei in infected cell lines by subcellular fractionation and
immunofluorescence staining.
