We previously reported that a higher degree of methylation of CpG sites in the
promoter (positions 31, 37, 43, 52, and 58) and enhancer site 7862 of human
papillomavirus (HPV) 16 was associated with a lower likelihood of being diagnosed
with HPV 16-associated CIN 2+. The purpose of this study was to replicate our
previous findings and, in addition, to evaluate the influence of plasma
concentrations of folate and vitamin B12 on the degree of HPV 16 methylation (HPV
16m). The study included 315 HPV 16-positive women diagnosed with either CIN 2+
or ≤CIN 1. Pyrosequencing technology was used to quantify the degree of HPV 16m. 
We reproduced the previously reported inverse association between HPV 16m and
risk of being diagnosed with CIN 2+. In addition, we observed that women with
higher plasma folate and HPV 16m or those with higher plasma vitamin B12 and HPV 
16m were 75% (P < 0.01) and 60% (P = 0.02) less likely to be diagnosed with CIN
2+, respectively. With a tertile increase in the plasma folate or vitamin B12,
there was a 50% (P = 0.03) and 40% (P = 0.07) increase in the odds of having a
higher degree of HPV 16m, respectively. This study provides initial evidence that
methyl donor micronutrients, folate and vitamin B12, may play an important role
in maintaining a desirably high degree of methylation at specific CpG sites in
the HPV E6 promoter and enhancer that are associated with the likelihood of being
diagnosed with CIN 2+.
