BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction has been observed in a range of liver diseases 
including chronic hepatitis C virus, alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary
cirrhosis and Wilson's disease. Such dysfunction may range from mild cognitive
changes to overt hepatic encephalopathy, and represents a significant
complication of liver disease that may negatively impact the patient's quality of
life, and normal activities of daily living (e.g., driving).
METHOD: This article reviews the published evidence relating to cognitive
dysfunction in liver disease.
OUTCOME: Issues of definition, diagnosis, epidemiology, aetiology, treatment and 
outcome are discussed. Particular attention is devoted to identifying the mild
cognitive changes that occur in liver diseases of different aetiology.
