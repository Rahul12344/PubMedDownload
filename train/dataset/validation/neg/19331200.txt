BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression is reportedly
frequently reduced in cancer. We examined heat-shock protein (HSP) expression in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: HCV-related HCC was examined in 73 patients who had
undergone hepatectomy, and the relationship between HSP70 and HLA class I
expressions, clinicopathological factors and survival was evaluated.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemically positive results for HSP70 and HLA class I were
seen in 67 (92%) and 43 cases (59%), respectively, while 38 patients (52%) were
positive for both. Increased HSP70 immunoreactivity was significantly associated 
with high histological grade of tumor differentiation (p = 0.0179), whereas
reduced HLA class I immunoreactivity was significantly associated with large
tumor size (p = 0.0082). No differences were apparent between disease-free and
overall survival in regard to expression levels.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HSP70 expression may be related to tumor
differentiation and HLA class I loss may occur with tumor growth in HCV-related
HCC.
