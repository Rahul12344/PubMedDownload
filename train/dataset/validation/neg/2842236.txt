Recent reports of cytomegalovirus associated colonic and oesophageal ulceration
in immunosuppressed patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, have
focused attention on the possibility that viral infections may in some cases be
the initial insult which leads in susceptible subjects to gastrointestinal
ulceration. In this case report we describe how systemic primary infection with
the cytomegalovirus was associated with the development of multiple gastric and
duodenal erosions.
