We have previously found that a 14-amino acid residue-peptide, T140, inhibits
infection of target cells by T cell line-tropic HIV-1 (X4-HIV-1) through its
specific binding to a chemokine receptor, CXCR4. Here, the importance of an
L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine (Nal) residue at position 3 in T140 for high anti-HIV
activity and inhibitory activity against Ca(2+) mobilization induced by stromal
cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha-stimulation through CXCR4 has initially been
shown by the synthesis and biological evaluation of several analogues, where
Nal(3) is substituted by diverse aromatic amino acids. Next, the order of the
N-terminal 3 residues (Arg(1)-Arg(2)-Nal(3)) has been proved to be important from
the structure--activity relationship (SAR) study shuffling these residues. Based 
on these results, we have found 10-residue peptides possessing modest anti-HIV
activity by systematic antiviral evaluation of a series of synthetic, shortened
analogues of T140.
