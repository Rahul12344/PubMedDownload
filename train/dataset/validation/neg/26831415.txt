Combination therapy with three drug regimens for human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection significantly suppresses the viral replication. However, this
therapeutic impact is restricted by adverse drug events and response in terms of 
short and long term efficacy. There are multiple factors involved in different
responses to antiretrovirals (ARVs) such as age, body weight, disease status,
diet and heredity. Pharmacogenomics deals with individual genetic make-up and its
role in drug efficacy and toxicity. In depth genetic research has provided
evidence to predict the risk of developing certain toxicities for which
personalized screening and surveillance protocols may be developed to prevent
side effects. Here we describe the use of pharmacogenomics for optimal use of
HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy).
