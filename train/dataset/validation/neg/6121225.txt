Morphological identification of the agent of Korean haemorrhagic fever (Hantaan
virus)as a member of the Bunyaviridae.

Korean haemorrhagic fever (KHF) (Hantaan virus), a rodent-borne viral illness, is
an important cause of human disease throughout much of Asia and Eastern Europe.
The agent responsible for KHF has not yet been conclusively identified.
Plaque-purified KHF virus was concentrated and then banded in a potassium
tartrate gradient. Material from the 1.17-1.19 g/ml band was examined by electron
microscopy and particles with a morphology identical to that of the family
Bunyaviridae were found. The particles were aggregated by KHF serum but not by
saline solution or non-immune serum. Identification of KHF virus as a member of
the family Bunyaviridae implies a potential for spread by arthropod vectors.
