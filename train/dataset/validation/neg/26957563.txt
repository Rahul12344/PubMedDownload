The sulfurea (sulf) allele is a silent epigenetic variant of a tomato (Solanum
lycopersicum) gene affecting pigment production. It is homozygous lethal but, in 
a heterozygote sulf/+, the wild-type (wt) allele undergoes silencing so that the 
plants exhibit chlorotic sectors. This transfer of the silenced state between
alleles is termed paramutation and is best characterized in maize. To understand 
the mechanism of paramutation we mapped SULF to the orthologue SLTAB2 of an
Arabidopsis gene that, consistent with the pigment deﬁciency, is involved in the 
translation of photosystem I. Paramutation of SLTAB2 is linked to an increase in 
DNA methylation and the production of small interfering RNAs at its promoter.
Virus-induced gene silencing of SLTAB2 phenocopies sulf, consistent with the
possibility that siRNAs mediate the paramutation of SULFUREA Unlike the maize
systems, the paramutagenicity of sulf is not, however, associated with repeated
sequences at the region of siRNA production or DNA methylation.
