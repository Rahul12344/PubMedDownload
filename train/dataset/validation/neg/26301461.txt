Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a major constraint to transboundary trade in
animal products, yet much of its natural ecology and epidemiology in endemic
regions is still poorly understood. To address this gap, a multidisciplinary,
molecular and conventional epidemiological approach was applied to an
investigation of endemic FMD in Vietnam. Within the study space, it was found
that 22.3% of sampled ruminants had previously been infected with FMD virus
(FMDV), of which 10.8% were persistent, asymptomatic carriers (2.4% of the total 
population). Descriptive data collected from targeted surveillance and a farm
questionnaire showed a significantly lower prevalence of FMDV infection for dairy
farms. In contrast, farms of intermediate size and/or history of infection in
2010 were at increased risk of FMD exposure. At the individual animal level,
buffalo had the highest exposure risk (over cattle), and there was spatial
heterogeneity in exposure risk at the commune level. Conversely, carrier
prevalence was higher for beef cattle, suggesting lower susceptibility of buffalo
to persistent FMDV infection. To characterize virus strains currently circulating
in Vietnam, partial FMDV genomic (VP1) sequences from carrier animals collected
between 2012 and 2013 (N = 27) and from FMDV outbreaks between 2009 and 2013
(N = 79) were compared by phylogenetic analysis. Sequence analysis suggested that
within the study period, there were two apparent novel introductions of serotype 
A viruses and that the dominant lineage of serotype O in Vietnam shifted from
SEA/Mya-98 to ME-SA/PanAsia. FMDV strains shared close ancestors with FMDV from
other South-East Asian countries indicating substantial transboundary movement of
the predominant circulating strains. Close genetic relationships were observed
between carrier and outbreak viruses, which may suggest that asymptomatic
carriers of FMDV contribute to regional disease persistence. Multiple viral
sequences obtained from carrier cattle over a 1-year period had considerable
within-animal genetic variation, indicating within-host virus evolution.
