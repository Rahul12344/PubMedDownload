BACKGROUND: Enteric infections are common where public health infrastructure is
lacking. This study assesses risk factors for a range of enteric infections among
children living in low-income, unplanned communities of urban Maputo, Mozambique.
METHODS & FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 17 neighborhoods of 
Maputo to assess the prevalence of reported diarrheal illness and
laboratory-confirmed enteric infections in children. We collected stool from
children aged 1-48 months, independent of reported symptoms, for molecular
detection of 15 common enteric pathogens by multiplex RT-PCR. We also collected
survey and observational data related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
characteristics; other environmental factors; and social, economic, and
demographic covariates. We analyzed stool from 759 children living in 425
household clusters (compounds) representing a range of environmental conditions. 
We detected ≥1 enteric pathogens in stool from most children (86%, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 84-89%) though diarrheal symptoms were only reported for 16% (95% 
CI: 13-19%) of children with enteric infections and 13% (95% CI: 11-15%) of all
children. Prevalence of any enteric infection was positively associated with age 
and ranged from 71% (95% CI: 64-77%) in children 1-11 months to 96% (95% CI:
93-98%) in children 24-48 months. We found poor sanitary conditions, such as
presence of feces or soiled diapers around the compound, to be associated with
higher risk of protozoan infections. Certain latrine features, including
drop-hole covers and latrine walls, and presence of a water tap on the compound
grounds were associated with a lower risk of bacterial and protozoan infections. 
Any breastfeeding was also associated with reduced risk of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of enteric infections, primarily among
children without diarrhea, and weak associations between bacterial and protozoan 
infections and environmental risk factors including WASH. Findings suggest that
environmental health interventions to limit infections would need to be
transformative given the high prevalence of enteric pathogen shedding and poor
sanitary conditions observed.
