Evolution of receptor specificity by viruses has several implications for viral
pathogenesis, host range, virus-mediated gene targeting, and viral adaptation
after organ transplantation and xenotransplantation, as well as for the emergence
of viral diseases. Recent evidence suggests that minimal changes in viral genomes
may trigger a shift in receptor usage for virus entry, even into the same cell
type. A capacity to exploit alternative entry pathways may reflect the ancient
evolutionary origins of viruses and a possible role as agents of horizontal gene 
transfers among cells.
