[Circulation of cytopathogenic enteric viruses in Lombardy 7 years after the
introduction of vaccination against poliomyelitis with the Sabin vaccine].

[Article in Italian]

Galli MG.

The Author has studied the circulation of enteric cytopathogenic viruses in
Lombardy in 1971, seven years after the mass vaccination campaign with Sabin
vaccine. The incidence of such viruses has already been studied in the same area 
in 1964-1965-1967 and in 1971. The present survey demonstrated the constant rate 
of non polio viruses. On the contrary no heterologous poliovirus were isolated.
