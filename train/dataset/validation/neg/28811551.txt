As a candidate for a rapid detection of biomaterials, terahertz (THz)
spectroscopy system can be considered with some advantage in non-destructive,
label-free, and non-contact manner. Because protein-ligand binding energy is in
the THz range, especially, most important conformational information in molecular
interactions can be captured by THz electromagnetic wave. Based on the THz
time-domain spectroscopy system, THz nano-metamaterial sensing chips were
prepared for great enhancing of detection sensitivity. A metamaterial sensing
chip was designed for increasing of absorption cross section of the target
sample, related to the transmitted THz near field enhancement via the composition
of metamaterial. The measured THz optical properties were then analyzed in terms 
of refractive index and absorption coefficient, and compared with simulation
results. Also, virus quantification regarding various concentrations of the
viruses was performed, showing a clear linearity. The proposed sensitive and
selective THz detection method can provide abundant information of detected
biomaterials to help deep understanding of fundamental optical characteristics of
them, suggesting rapid diagnosis way especially useful for such dangerous and
time-sensitive target biomaterials.
