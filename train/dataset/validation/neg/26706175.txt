Several CD4 mimics have been reported as HIV-1 entry inhibitors which can block
the interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 and the cell
surface protein CD4. We previously found a lead compound 2 (YYA-021) with high
anti-HIV activity and low cytotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic analysis however showed
compound 2 to have wide tissue distribution and relatively high distribution
volumes in rats and rhesus macaques. In the present study we searched for more
hydrophilic CD4 mimics with a view to reducing tissue distribution. A new
compound (5) with a 1,3-benzodioxolyl moiety was found to have relatively high
anti-HIV activity and no significant cytotoxicity. Compound 5 is more hydrophilic
than compound 2 and the pharmacokinetics of the intravenous administration of
compound 5 in a rhesus macaque showed that compound 5 has lower tissue
distribution than compound 2, suggesting that compound 5 possesses a better
profile.
