We have previously demonstrated that the ribozyme located 34 nucleotides
downstream of the polyadenylation site on the antigenomic RNA of the hepatitis
delta virus can stabilize the downstream transcript after polyadenylation. Here, 
we have reports on further investigations of the molecular mechanism of this
stabilization effect and the potential role of the small and large delta
antigens. We found that the downstream transcripts after polyadenylation were
stabilized by the ribozyme independently of either the small or large delta
antigen. The stabilization effect was abolished as the ribozyme activity was
eliminated by mutations on either the enzyme domain or target site of the
ribozyme. These findings suggested that it was the ribozyme activity rather than 
the RNA structure or the delta antigens that contributed to the stabilization
effect.
