Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools are essential for monitoring the
health status of farmed species. After the development of genomic probe
diagnostic systems in the 1990s, followed by PCR-based systems, a miniarray
method has been developed allowing one-step multiple detection. The miniarray
method was developed to enable the accessibility of powerful array technology. To
use this system, hybridisation and washing process were modified, resulting into 
a significant increase in the test's rapidity and sensitivity. With miniarray
technology, hybridisation time is reduced to 20 min, whereas other methods
require a longer hybridisation time. Hybridisation of the PCR product on a nylon 
membrane and revelation of the hybrids by an antibody increase considerably the
ability of pathogen's detection. A first application is developed for the
diagnosis of two specific viruses which are, by their geographical range and
their impact on the production, very important in shrimp pathology, namely, the
White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) and the Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic 
Necrosis Virus (IHHNV).
