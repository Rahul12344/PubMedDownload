BACKGROUND: An important question in dengue pathogenesis is the identity of
immune cells involved in the control of dengue virus infection at the site of the
mosquito bite. There is evidence that infection of immature myeloid dendritic
cells plays a crucial role in dengue pathogenesis and that the interaction of the
viral envelope E glycoprotein with CD209/DC-SIGN is a key element for their
productive infection. Dermal macrophages express CD209, yet little is known about
their role in dengue virus infection.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, we showed that dermal macrophages bound recombinant
envelope E glycoprotein fused to green fluorescent protein. Because dermal
macrophages stain for IL-10 in situ, we generated dermal-type macrophages from
monocytes in the presence of IL-10 to study their infection by dengue virus. The 
macrophages were able to internalize the virus, but progeny virus production was 
undetectable in the infected cells. In addition, no IFN-alpha was produced in
response to the virus. The inability of dengue virus to grow in the macrophages
was attributable to accumulation of internalized virus particles into
poorly-acidified phagosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Aborting infection by viral sequestration in early phagosomes would 
present a novel means to curb infection of enveloped virus and may constitute a
prime defense system to prevent dengue virus spread shortly after the bite of the
infected mosquito.
