BACKGROUND: Genotyping of HBV is generally used for determining the
epidemiological relationship between various virus strains and origin of
infection mostly in research studies. The utility of genotyping for clinical
applications is only beginning to gain importance. Whether HBV genotyping will
constitute part of the clinical evaluation of Hepatitis B patients depends
largely on the availability of the relevance of the evidence based information.
Since Pakistan has a HBV genotype distribution which has been considered less
virulent as investigated by earlier studies from south East Asian countries, a
study on correlation between HBV genotypes and risk of progression to further
complex hepatic infection was much needed
METHODS: A total of 295 patients with HBsAg positive were selected from the
Pakistan Medical Research Council's (PMRC) out patient clinics. Two hundred and
twenty six (77%) were males, sixty nine (23%) were females (M to F ratio 3.3:1).
RESULTS: Out of 295 patients, 156 (53.2%) had Acute(CAH), 71 (24.2%) were HBV
Carriers, 54 (18.4%) had Chronic liver disease (CLD) Hepatitis. 14 (4.7%) were
Cirrhosis and HCC patients. Genotype D was the most prevalent genotype in all
categories of HBV patients, Acute (108), Chronic (39), and Carrier
(53).Cirrhosis/HCC (7) were HBV/D positive. Genotype A was the second most
prevalent with 28 (13%) in acute cases, 12 (22.2%) in chronics, 14 (19.7%) in
carriers and 5 (41.7) in Cirrhosis/HCC patients. Mixed genotype (A/D) was found
in 20 (12.8%) of Acute patients, 3 (5.6%) of Chronic and 4 (5.6%) of carriers,
none in case of severe liver conditions.
CONCLUSION: Mixed HBV genotypes A, D and A/D combination were present in all
categories of patients except that no A/D combination was detected in severe
conditions. Genotype D was the dominant genotype. However, genotype A was found
to be more strongly associated with severe liver disease. Mixed genotype (A/D)
did not significantly appear to influence the clinical outcome.
