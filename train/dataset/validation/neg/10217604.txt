Novel ways of delivering plasmid DNA to elicit humoral IgA, IgG and cell-mediated
immune responses in mice were investigated. Intraoral administration of DNA in
the cheek, using a jet immunization technique, elicited the highest IgA mucosal
responses. Intranasal immunization gave strong mucosal IgA responses and
persistent systemic IgG. Immunoglobulin isotype analysis revealed an IgG1 profile
for intramuscular tongue and gene gun immunizations and an IgG2a profile
following oral jet injection and intranasal application. The route of delivery
was of importance for the characteristics and quality of the mucosal immune
response following DNA immunization. For DNA vaccine delivery, the intraoral jet 
injection technique has the advantages of being a simple and rapid way of
administering the DNA in solution and of provoking specific mucosal IgA when
administered in the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue.
