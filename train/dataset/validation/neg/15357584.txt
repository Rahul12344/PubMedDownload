A practical, efficient synthesis of 1, a hepatitis C virus RNA replication
inhibitor, is described. Starting with the inexpensive diacetone glucose, the
12-step synthesis features a novel stereoselective rearrangement to prepare the
key crystalline furanose diol intermediate. This is followed by a highly
selective glycosidation to couple the C-2 branched furanose epoxide with
deazapurine.
