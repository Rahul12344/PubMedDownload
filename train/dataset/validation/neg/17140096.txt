[Have we defeated the principal zoonoses?].

[Article in French]

Blancou J.

Following an overview of some successful campaigns against zoonoses, this paper
examines other zoonotic diseases that are likely to be brought under control in
industrialized countries, such as brucellosis, tuberculosis and canine or
wildlife rabies. The author goes on to explain the reasons for the failure to
eradicate some other zoonoses in developing countries, and concludes by examining
reasons for optimism or pessimism, taking into account new methods of prevention 
and control.
