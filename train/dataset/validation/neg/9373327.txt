BACKGROUND: There is considerable interest in the specific targeting of
therapeutic agents to cancer cells. Of particular promise is a technique known as
Antibody-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). In this approach an enzyme is
targeted to the tumour by its conjugation to a tumour specific-antibody tumour.
After allowing sufficient time for the conjugate to localise at the tumour and
clear from the circulatory system, a relatively non-toxic prodrug is
administered. This prodrug is converted to a highly cytotoxic drug by the action 
of the targeted enzyme localised at the tumour site.
OBJECTIVES: To construct gene fusions between the pseudomonad carboxypeptidase G2
(CPG2) gene and DNA encoding MFE-23 (an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
single-chain Fv (scFv) molecule), derived from a phage display library. To
overexpress the resultant gene fusions in Escherichia coli, and assess the in
vitro and in vivo properties of the purified fusion proteins.
STUDY DESIGN: To introduce unique cloning restriction sites into the 5'-end of
the CPG2 gene by site-directed mutagenesis to facilitate fusion to the 3'-end of 
the gene encoding MFE-23 (constructs with or without a flexible (Gly4Ser)3
linker-encoding sequence were designed). To overexpress the resultant gene
fusions under transcriptional control of the lac promoter and to direct the
fusion proteins produced to the periplasmic space of E. coli through
translational coupling to the pelB signal peptide.
RESULTS: Biologically active recombinant CPG2::MFE-23 scFv fusion proteins were
produced in E. coli and shown to possess enzyme and anti-CEA activity. Affinity
chromatography followed by size exclusion gel filtration yielded approximately
0.7-1.4 mg/l from shake flask culture. The fusion protein in which the enzyme and
antibody moieties were joined by a linker peptide was shown to be effectively
localised in nude mice bearing human colon tumour xenografts, giving favourable
tumour to blood ratios.
CONCLUSION: MFE-23 scFv serves as an ideal candidate for the antibody arm of a
bacterially expressed fusion protein with CPG2. The biological properties of this
recombinant protein suggest that it may be employed for tumour specific prodrug
activation. However, further assessment of its stability and pharmokinetics is
required if genetic fusion is to be considered as an alternative to chemical
conjugation.
