Immunological reactivity of antisera to sodium dodecyl sulfate-derived
polypeptides of polyoma virions.

McMillen J, Consigli RA.

A study was undertaken to produce antisera to sodium dodecyl sulfate-derived
polyoma virion polypeptides. With the use of this antisera, it was possible to
detect, by immunofluorescence, cytoplasmic synthesis of V1, V2, and V3
polypeptides at 18 h postinfection and subsequent transport to the nucleus by 22 
h postinfection. Anti-V1, anti-V2, and anti-V3 sera did not react with intact
virions in an immunodiffusion assay, nor did they possess hemagglutination
inhibition or viral neutralization activity. Antiserum produced against the four 
host histone polypeptides (V4 through V7) demonstrated immunofluorescence when
reacted with polyoma-infected cells but not with uninfected cells. Antihistone
serum was also capable of neutralizing viral infectivity, inhibiting
hemagglutination and reacting with whole virions in an immunodiffusion assay.
