[Kinetic properties of peroxidase from intact and virus-infected tobacco leaves].

Voronova VA, Ugarova NN, Andreeva VA.

The kinetic properties of peroxidase from tobacco leaves (var. Xanthie and
Samsun) infected with various viruses (TMV, Xt and Xy, were compared. The enzyme 
from intact plant grown under similar conditions was used as control. The pH
dependencies of the peroxidase activity for o-dianisidine peroxidation in
infected and control plants were identical. Viral infection produces a dramatic
effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme: the KM values for o-dianisidine
were decreased by 20-40% and those for H2O2 - by 30-40% in the case of the Samsun
var. infected with TMV and Xanthie var. infected with a highly virulent strain of
potato X-virus. The decrease of these values in plants infected with a weakly
virulent strain of the virus was insignificant.
