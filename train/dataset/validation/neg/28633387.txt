Current evidence suggests that anal intercourse (AI) during sex work is common in
sub-Saharan Africa, but there have been few studies in which the contribution of 
heterosexual AI to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics has been
investigated. Using a respondent-driven sampling survey of female sex workers
(FSWs; n = 466) in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, in 2014, we estimated AI prevalence
and frequency. Poisson regressions were used to identify AI determinants.
Approximately 20% of FSWs engaged in AI during a normal week (95% confidence
interval: 15, 26). Women who performed AI were generally younger, had been
selling sex for longer, were born in Côte d'Ivoire, and reported higher sex-work 
income, more frequent sex in public places, and violence from clients than women 
not reporting AI. Condom use was lower, condom breakage/slippage more frequent,
and use of water-based lubricants was less frequently reported for AI than for
vaginal intercourse. Using a dynamic transmission model, we estimated that 22%
(95% credible interval: 11, 37% of new HIV infections could have been averted
among FSWs during 2000-2015 if AI had been substituted for vaginal intercourse.
Despite representing a small fraction of all sex acts, AI is an underestimated
source of HIV transmission. Increasing availability and uptake of condoms,
lubricants, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for women engaging in AI could help
mitigate HIV risk.
