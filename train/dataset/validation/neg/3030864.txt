The combination measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine in healthy
children.

Arbeter AM, Baker L, Starr SE, Plotkin SA.

A clinical trial was conducted to compare the combination measles, mumps,
rubella, varicella vaccine (MMRV) and the standard measles, mumps, rubella
vaccine and subsequent varicella vaccine (MMR + V) in 15 to 17 month old healthy 
children. Both the MMRV and MMR + V schedules stimulated virtually 100%
seroconversion for all component viruses. Mean antibody titers were similar for
each virus component in the two vaccine groups. Clinical reactivity post
immunization was also similar with 25-29% morbilliform rashes, 12-25% mild
papulovesicular (varicella) rashes, and 12.5-18% temperature elevations above 101
degrees F. Antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses were persistent in
8/10 originally seronegative MMRV vaccinees and 5/5 MMR + V recipients tested. On
MMRV recipient had a household exposure to chickenpox during the year
postvaccination that resulted in a subclinical boost in varicella antibody titer.
Two children in the MMR + V group had close varicella exposures: one developed
mild varicella (20 lesions). There were no known exposures to natural measles,
mumps, or rubella. Three of four MMRV vaccinees with low titer antibody to
varicella prior to immunization had greater than four-fold rises in antibodies.
The combination measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine is an immunogenic,
safe and cost effective approach to varicella immunization of healthy children.
