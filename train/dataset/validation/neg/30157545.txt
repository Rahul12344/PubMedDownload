Despite the well-proven, safe and effective therapies for hepatitis B infection, 
delivery of treatment remains a significant challenge in resource-poor settings. 
Geopolitical and economic restrictions present additional difficulties in
providing care in North Korea. However, treatment of patients with chronic
hepatitis B remains a top priority for both the North Korean Ministry of Public
Health and international agencies working in North Korean hepatitis healthcare
facilities. Working in partnership, a path was created to institute this
much-needed program. A consortium of United States and Australian humanitarian
non-governmental organizations along with generous individual and corporate
donors working in concert with local and national health authorities have
succeeded in establishing the first hepatitis B treatment program in North Korea.
The essential elements of this program include renovation of existing hepatitis
hospitals, access to antiviral medications, establishment of laboratory
facilities, creation of medical documentation and record-keeping, training of
local health care professionals, and quarterly visits by international volunteer 
physicians and laboratory experts. Management and treatment decisions are made
bilaterally. To date, nearly 1,500 patients have been evaluated, and over 800
have been started on long-term antiviral therapy. It is envisioned that this
program will eventually be managed and funded by the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea Ministry of Public Health. This program's success demonstrates a
potential model for delivery of antiviral therapy for patients suffering from
hepatitis B in other developing countries.
