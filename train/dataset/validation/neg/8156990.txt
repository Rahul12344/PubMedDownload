The nucleocapsid (NC) protein of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 (NCp7) is
responsible for packaging the viral RNA by recognizing a packaging site (PSI) on 
the viral RNA genome. NCp7 is a molecule of 55 amino acids containing two zinc
fingers, with only the first one being highly conserved among retroviruses. The
first zinc finger is flanked by two basic amino acid clusters. Here we
demonstrate that chemically synthesized NCp7 specifically binds to viral RNA
containing the PSI using competitive filter binding assays. Deletion of the PSI
from the RNA abrogates this effect. The 35 N-terminal amino acids of NCp7,
comprising the first zinc finger, are sufficient for specific RNA binding.
Chemically synthesized mutants of the first zinc finger demonstrate that the
amino acid residues C-C-C/H-C/H are required for specific RNA binding and zinc
coordination. Amino acid residues F16 and T24, but not K20, E21 and G22, located 
within this zinc finger, are essential for specific RNA binding as well. The
second zinc finger cannot replace the first one. Furthermore, mutations in the
basic amino acid residues flanking the first zinc finger demonstrate that R3, 7, 
10, 29 and 32 but not K11, 14, 33 and 34 are also essential for specific binding.
Specific binding to viral RNA is also observed with recombinant NCp15 and
Pr55Gag. The results demonstrate for the first time specific interaction of a
retroviral NC protein with its PSI RNA in vitro.
