Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global public health concern. It causes
respiratory diseases ranging from mild illness to fatal disease. Natural killer
(NK) cells are an innate immune component that kill infected cells and secrete
cytokines to modulate the adaptive immune system; they constitute the first-line 
defense and play important roles in controlling IAV infection. This study
evaluated the effect of daily administration of heat-treated Lactobacillus
plantarum nF1-fortified yogurt on immunity and protection against IAV infection. 
Mice administered with heat-treated L. plantarum nF1-fortified yogurt showed
elevated NK cell-related cytokine expression levels. Daily administration of the 
L. plantarum nF1-fortified yogurt before IAV infection also enhanced splenic NK
activity, lung inflammatory cytokine responses, and survival rate. Thus, daily
administration of nF1-fortified yogurt enhances host immunity and helps prevent
IAV infection.
