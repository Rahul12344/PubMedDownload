BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genetic variations in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene have 
been associated with viral response to PEG-interferon-α/ribavirin (PR) therapy in
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected patients from North America, Europe
and Asia. The importance of these IL28B variants for Argentine patients remains
unknown.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: IL28B host genotypes (rs8099917 and rs12979860) were
determined in a population of Argentine patients with European ancestry. Results 
were analyzed looking for their association with sustained virologic response
(SVR) to PR therapy and compared with other baseline hosts' biochemical,
histological and virological predictors of response.
RESULTS: We studied 102 patients, 60% were men, and 40% of them were rs8099917 TT
and 18% rs12979860 CC. Mean baseline serum HCV RNA was 1.673.092 IU/mL and mean F
score was: 2.10 ± 1.18 (21% cirrhotic). SVR rate was higher in rs8099917 TT
genotypes (55%) when compared to GT/GG (25%) (p = 0.002) and in rs1512979860 CC
(64%) than in CT/TT (30%) (p = 0.004). The univariate analysis showed that
rs8099917 TT (OR 3.7; 95 %CI 1.5-8.7; p = 0.002), rs12979860 CC (OR 4.6; 95%CI
1.5-13.7; p = 0.006), low viral load (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.7-12.6; p = 0.002) and
F0-2 (OR 8.5; 95% CI 2.3-30.6; p = 0.001) were significantly associated with SVR.
In the multivariate analysis, rs12979860 CC, rs8099917 TT, viral load < 400.000
IU/mL and F0-2 were associated with SVR rates (p = 0.029, p = 0.012, p = 0.013
and p = 0.004, respectively).
CONCLUSION: IL28B host genotypes should be added to baseline predictors of
response to PR therapy in Latin American patients with European ancestry.
