It may be possible, one day, to use gene therapy to treat diseases whose genetic 
defects have been discerned. Because many genes responsible for inherited eye
disorders within the retina have been identified, diseases of the eye are prime
candidates for this form of therapy. The eye also has the advantage of being
highly accessible with altered immunological properties, important considerations
for easy delivery of virus and avoidance of systemic immune responses. Currently,
adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and lentivirus have been used to successfully 
transfer genetic material to retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. 
By harnessing therapeutic genes to these viruses, researchers have been able to
demonstrate rescue in rodent models of retinitis pigmentosa, providing evidence
that this form of therapy can be effective in delaying photoreceptor cell death. 
Future challenges include confirming therapeutic effects in animal models with
eyes more anatomically similar to those of humans and demonstrating long-term
rescue with minimal toxicity.
