Peptide maps and N-terminal sequences of polypeptides from early region 1A of
human adenovirus 5.

Experiments exploring the reasons for a multiplicity of products from early
region 1A of adenovirus 5 are described. Labeled early region 1A products from
wild-type virus were synthesized in infected cells and in a cell-free system
programmed with mRNA from infected cells, immunoprecipitated specifically with an
antipeptide serum, E1A-C1, directed against the C-terminal sequence of E1A
products, and separated by gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional maps of
[35S]methionine-labeled peptides were consistent with antigens of 52,000 daltons 
(52K) and 48.5K being from the 13S mRNA and antigens of 50K, 45K, and 35K from
the 12S mRNA. Partial N-terminal sequences of 52K, 50K, 48.5K, and 45K
synthesized in vitro showed that each of these antigens was initiated at the
predicted ATG at nucleotide 560 in the DNA sequence. These results eliminate
multiple initiation sites and proteolytic cleavage at the N-terminal end as
sources of antigen diversity. Peptide maps and N-terminal sequences were obtained
in a similar way for E1A products from the Ad5 deletion mutant dl1504, which
lacks the normal initiator codon. As predicted, these polypeptides are initiated 
at the next ATG, 15 codons downstream in the wild-type sequence. These results
are discussed in relation to Kozak's ribosomal scanning model.
