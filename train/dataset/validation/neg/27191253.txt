Many of the survivors of the 2014-2015 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in
western Africa were women of childbearing age. Limited clinical and laboratory
data exist that describe these women's pregnancies and outcomes. We report the
case of an EVD survivor who became pregnant and delivered her child in the United
States, and we discuss implications of this case for infection control practices 
in obstetric services. Hospitals in the United States must be prepared to care
for EVD survivors.
