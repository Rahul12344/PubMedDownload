BACKGROUND: The efficacy of raltegravir plus optimized background therapy (OBT)
has been demonstrated for antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced HIV-1-infected
patients in randomized clinical trials. We studied viro-immunological response,
pharmacokinetic parameters and genotypic test results in an observational cohort 
of multiple ARV class-experienced patients starting a raltegravir-based regimen.
METHODS: Already enrolled ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort patients with virological
failure were included in this study after starting a raltegravir-based regimen
(400 mg twice a day, week 0). Virological success was defined by the plasma HIV-1
RNA level [viral load (VL)] <2.7 log(10) copies/mL at week 12 and <1.7 log(10)
copies/mL at week 24. One patient was excluded from further analysis (no
follow-up after week 4).
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients [male/female = 43/8, median age = 48 (interquartile
range = 43, 55) years] were included. At week 0, median CD4 count was 244 (110;
310)/mm(3) and median VL was 4.2 (3.6, 4.7) log(10) copies/mL. At week 24, 39
(78%) patients experienced virological success: 4 (44%), 14 (82%) and 21 (87%)
patients with a genotypic sensitivity score <1, > or =1 and <2 and > or =2 (P =
0.02), respectively. Raltegravir-related mutations emerged in 9 of 11 failing
patients (82%): Q148H/R (n = 5), N155S/H (n = 3) and S230N (n = 1). Median CD4
increases from week 0 to week 4 and week 24 were 28 (-4, 85) and 57 (0, 156)
cells/mm(3), respectively. A poor immune response was independently associated
with a lower VL decline (week 0 to week 12) [odds ratio (OR): 3.5, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.4, 8.4, for 1 log(10) less] and CD4+% at baseline (OR: 2.6, 95% 
CI: 0.97, 8.3, for 10% lower).
CONCLUSIONS: Raltegravir plus OBT provided a good virological success rate in
highly pre-treated patients under clinical routine conditions.
