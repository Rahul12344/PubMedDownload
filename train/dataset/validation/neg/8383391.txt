Northern (RNA) blot analysis was used to compare immediate-early (IE) transcripts
among strains of bovine herpesvirus type 1 and type 5 differing in neurovirulent 
potential. Results obtained from the neurovirulent strain N569 were compared to
those from two non-neurovirulent strains, Jura and K22. Strain N569 expressed
three major IE transcripts with similar size and transcription pattern as
previously reported for strain Jura and K22 (Wirth et al., 1989, 1991, 1992),
except for some differences in the 5' terminal sequence common to the alternative
spliced IE transcripts IER4.2 and IER2.9. More significant differences were
discovered for some minor IE transcripts. Those transcribed over joined genome
ends during replicative phase were found to be drastically overexpressed for
strain N569 under IE condition. Among them two very long IE transcripts were
detected clearly for strain N569, however hardly recognized for strain Jura and
K22. These two transcripts were found to be encoded in addition to the joined
terminal HindIII genome fragments by the second HindIII fragment J from the left 
genome end.
