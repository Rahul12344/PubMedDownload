Mechanism of activation of human ras genes cloned from a gastric adenocarcinoma
and a pancreatic carcinoma cell line.

O'Hara BM, Oskarsson M, Tainsky MA, Blair DG.

We have analyzed the mechanism of activation of two human ras oncogenes. We have 
also identified a rasN gene from a human gastric adenocarcinoma which efficiently
induced both morphological transformation and tumorigenicity of NIH3T3 cells in a
transfection assay. The rasN gene in tumor tissue DNA did not appear to be
rearranged or amplified. A molecular clone, which contained an EcoRI fragment
spanning the first and second rasN exons, was molecularly cloned directly from
the human tumor DNA. Chimeric constructions and DNA sequencing defined the
mechanism of activation of the gene as a mutation in the 61st amino acid codon
substituting arginine for glutamine. Normal DNA isolated from Epstein-Barr virus 
immortalized lymphocytes derived from the same patient did not induce
morphological transformation or tumorigenicity in NIH3T3 cells. A cloned cell
line isolated from the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line Panc1 had previously 
been shown to contain an activated rasK-2. Sequence analysis of the cloned
transfected gene reveals a G to A change within codon 12, which is presumably
responsible for its biological activity. This represents the first identification
of a codon 12 aspartic acid substitution of a c-rask oncogene from a human
tumor-derived cell line.
