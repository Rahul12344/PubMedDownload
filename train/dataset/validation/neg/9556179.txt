An outbreak of hepatitis A is described involving thirteen cases in a town in
central-northern Italy. The consumption of infected clams, caught in a polluted
coastal area of the Adriatic Sea, caused hepatitis A in all five members of a
family consisting of mother, father and children, two of whom attended primary
school. The epidemic subsequently spread to the primary school with a secondary
attack rate of 7.9%, 0 for female pupils and 18.9% for males. The epidemiological
and environmental investigations showed that the critical exposure took place in 
the boys' toilet in the primary school (OR: 32.79, 95% CI: 6.83-157.45). To
prevent the spreading of contagion, extra disinfection was carried out in the
whole school and health education campaigns were mounted. The good basic hygienic
conditions of the homes, together with the cooperation of school staff in
surveillance and providing information, allowed the epidemic to be controlled.
