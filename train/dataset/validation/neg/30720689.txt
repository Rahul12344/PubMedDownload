BACKGROUND: An 11-year-old girl with dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8)
deficiency was proposed for potentially curative hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT), the donor being her haploidentical mother. However,
end-stage liver disease caused by chronic Cryptosporidium infection required
liver transplantation before HSCT.
METHODS: Consequently, a staged approach of a sequential liver transplant
followed by a HSCT was planned with her mother as the donor for both liver and
HSCT.
RESULTS: The patient successfully underwent a left-lobe orthotopic liver
transplant; however, she developed a biliary leak delaying the HSCT. Notably, the
recipient demonstrated 3% donor lymphocyte chimerism in her peripheral blood
immediately before HSCT. Haploidentical-related donor HSCT performed 2 months
after liver transplantation was complicated by the development of
acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus viremia, primary graft failure, and
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The patient died from sinusoidal obstruction
syndrome-associated multiorgan failure with Candida sepsis on day +40 following
HSCT.
CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the many considerations inherent to planning for HSCT
preceded by liver transplant in patients with primary immunodeficiencies,
including the role of prolonged immunosuppression and the risk of infection
before immune reconstitution. We also discuss the implications of potential
recipient sensitization against donor stem cells precipitated by exposure of the 
recipient to the donor lymphocytes from the transplanted organ.
