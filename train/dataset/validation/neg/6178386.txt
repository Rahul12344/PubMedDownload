Rat hybridoma antibodies against canine parvovirus.

Burtonboy G, Bazin H, Delferriere N.

Hybrid cells have been produced by fusion between rat myeloma cells IR983F and
spleen cells from a LOU rat immunized with canine enteritis parvovirus. Four
stable cell lines were selected each secreting a monoclonal antibody directed
against this virus. By indirect immunofluorescence, the antigenic determinants
recognized by these antibodies were found to be present not only in canine
parvovirus infected cells but also in cells infected by the related parvoviruses 
of mink enteritis and feline panleukopenia. Two of the monoclonal antibodies
inhibit hemagglutination by the canine virus and neutralize its infectivity.
Hybrid cells were transplanted into histocompatible animals, and large amounts of
the antibodies were obtained.
