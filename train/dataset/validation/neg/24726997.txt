Swine appear to be a key species in the generation of novel human influenza
pandemics. Previous pandemic viruses are postulated to have evolved in swine by
reassortment of avian, human, and swine influenza viruses. The human pandemic
influenza viruses that emerged in 1957 and 1968 as well as swine viruses
circulating since 1998 encode PB1 segments derived from avian influenza viruses. 
Here we investigate the possible role in viral replication and virulence of the
PB1 gene segments present in two swine H1N2 influenza A viruses,
A/swine/Sweden/1021/2009(H1N2) (sw 1021) and A/swine/Sweden/9706/2010(H1N2) (sw
9706), where the sw 1021 virus has shown to be more pathogenic in mice. By using 
reverse genetics, we swapped the PB1 genes of these two viruses. Similar to the
sw 9706 virus, chimeric sw 1021 virus carrying the sw 9706 PB1 gene was not
virulent in mice. In contrast, replacement of the PB1 gene of the sw 9706 virus
by that from sw 1021 virus resulted in increased pathogenicity. Our study
demonstrated that differences in virulence of swine influenza virus subtype H1N2 
are attributed at least in part to the PB1 segment.
