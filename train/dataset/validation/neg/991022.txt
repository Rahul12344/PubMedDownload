The Canadian influenza decision, 1976.

Morrison AB, Liston AJ, Abbott JD.

This paper explains the Canadian decision process following the isolation and
identification of A/New Jersey/8/76 at Fort Dix, New Jersey in February 1976. The
cause for concern was the emergence of a swine-like strain related to that which 
caused the 1918-19 pandemic, together with proved man-to-man transmission. This
concern was reinforced since all new influenza A strains known to have infected
the number of persons involved at Fort Dix have become strains of epidemic
importance. The Fort Dix outbreak gave sufficient warning to allow implementation
of a national vaccination program, to prevent and protect against influenza. In
the past such an opportunity had not occurred, and vaccine use had, at best,
constituted an intervention in the course of an outbreak. The National Advisory
Committee on Immunizing Agents had all available information when it reached its 
decision to recommend vaccination with bivalent (A/Victoria and A/New Jersey) or 
with monovalent (A/New Jersey) vaccine for selective, high-risk groups. This was 
an independent, scientifically based decision.
