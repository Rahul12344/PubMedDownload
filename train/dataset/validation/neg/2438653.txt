The sequence of a viroid from grapevine closely related to severe isolates of
citrus exocortis viroid.

García-Arenal F, Pallás V, Flores R.

The primary structure of a grapevine viroid (GVs) isolated in Spain was
determined. The sequence consisted of 369 nucleotide residues forming a circular 
molecule. GVs presented extensive homology with viroids of the potato spindle
tuber viroid (PSTV) group, that was specially high in the case of citrus
exocortis viroid (CEV) both with variants found in isolates inducing severe (92% 
with CEV-A) and mild (89% with CEV-DE26) symptoms on tomato. The secondary
structure proposed for GVs showed that the changes in the sequence in relation to
CEV-A generated modifications of the secondary structure particularly important
in the left terminal (Tl), variable (V) and pathogenesis (P) viroid domains that 
have been postulated. Nevertheless it was noted in GVs a central core in the P
domain that is conserved in the class A sequence variants characteristic of
severe isolates, but not in the class B ones found in mild isolates of CEV. These
observations indicate that GVs should be considered as a severe isolate of CEV
from grapevine (CEV-g), a suggestion that correlates with the biological
properties of CEV-g both in tomato and in Gynura aurantiaca. The presence of this
central core in the P domain seems to characterize all the variants of CEV
inducing severe symptoms in tomato.
