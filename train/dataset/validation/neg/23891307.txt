A cDNA clone of a genotype 4 swine hepatitis E virus (HEV) strain (SAAS-FX17),
identified in Shanghai, has been constructed. Capped RNA transcripts were
prepared in vitro and shown to be replication-competent in Huh7 cells.
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats administered the RNA transcripts by intrahepatic
inoculation developed active infections as evidenced by fecal virus shedding and 
sero-conversion to anti-HEV. The former was first detected between 23 and 30 days
post-inoculation (dpi) and persisted until 45 dpi. Sera of rats inoculated with
RNA transcripts became anti-HEV positive between 30 and 40 dpi, and reverted to
anti-HEV negative at 52 dpi. Our data indicate for the first time that
intrahepatic inoculation of rats with RNA transcripts of an HEV cDNA clone may
serve as an alternative animal model for HEV research.
