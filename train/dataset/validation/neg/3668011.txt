Persistent viral infections have been postulated to be trigger factors for the
development of autoimmune disease. We report the development of vitiligo in four 
patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related conditions and in one
patient with hepatitis who later developed both psoriasis and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other common features were hepatitis and
multiple other viral infections. Ribavirin was associated with repigmentation in 
one patient. Vitiligo may be an example of an autoimmune disease triggered by
viral infection in a genetically predisposed host.
