Hepatitis E infection is usually a self-limiting disease. In industrialized
countries, sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections have been
described; their number seems to be increasing in European countries. We report
the first human case of autochthonous acute hepatitis E confirmed in Portugal.
Patients with acute non-A-C hepatitis should be tested for HEV in Portugal and
hepatitis E infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
unexplained hepatitis cases.
