Various possible causes of proventriculitis include virus, bacteria, fungus,
protozoans, nematodes, biogenic amines and excessive copper sulphate. In the
present case, parasites were found in the lumen of the proventriculus, gizzard
and duodenum of a poultry bird. Characteristic features of the parasite were
studied and confirmed as Ascaridia galli. An ulcerative proventriculitis evident 
as denuded superficial epithelium, sub-epithelial hemorrhages, infiltration of
the inflammatory cells and fibrosis were seen at histopathology. Proventriculitis
caused by A. galli has not been reported till date. Here, we report a case of
ulcerative proventriculitis in a poultry bird caused by nematode, A. galli.
