Oligonucleotide microarrays have been applied to microbial surveillance and
discovery where highly multiplexed assays are required to address a wide range of
genetic targets. Although printing density continues to increase, the design of
comprehensive microbial probe sets remains a daunting challenge, particularly in 
virology where rapid sequence evolution and database expansion confound static
solutions. Here, we present a strategy for probe design based on protein
sequences that is responsive to the unique problems posed in virus detection and 
discovery. The method uses the Protein Families database (Pfam) and motif finding
algorithms to identify oligonucleotide probes in conserved amino acid regions and
untranslated sequences. In silico testing using an experimentally derived
thermodynamic model indicated near complete coverage of the viral sequence
database.
