OBJECTIVE: Although transient hyperphosphatasemia (TH) has been well known for
decades, its etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear. We aimed to study the
clinical characteristics of children diagnosed with TH compared to older studies 
in order to expand our knowledge and understanding of this condition and to try
and find a subgroup of children who are more prone to develop TH.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 60 children diagnosed at Maccabi Health
Services and Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel with TH between the years
2003-08. One hundred and twenty-two children matched by age, gender and
presenting symptoms served as the control group. The patients were divided into
four subgroups by their presenting symptoms: infectious disease 33%, failure to
thrive 28%, diarrhea 15% and other 23%. The Hydragel 7 ISO-PAL and Hydragel 15
ISO-PAL kits were used for the identification and quantification of ALP
isoenzymes in human serum.
RESULTS: The ALP levels of the study group were 805-8619 U\L (mean 2311 U\L),
without differences between the subgroups. The mean duration of TH was 12 weeks. 
ALP isoenzymes levels were measured in one-third of the patients, and showed that
the bone isoenzyme was elevated in most. Forty-three (71%) subjects were
diagnosed in the second half of the calendar year.
CONCLUSIONS: We could not establish an etiological explanation for TH. We presume
that it is a complex mechanism in which different stimuli led to upregulation of 
the enzyme.
