We propose that the ratios of lymphocyte subsets: CD4+/CD8+, CD4+/CD3+, and
CD8+/CD3+, graphically displayed in this order, could be an easy way of
immunophenotyping and a simple form of interpretation both for clinicians and
patients. A total of 187 asymptomatic HIV-positive patients, -including 83
symptomatic patients with AIDS- and a normal comparative age group of 36
patients, were studied by flow cytometry. Ratios were graphically displayed on
millimetric-grid paper, and a specific point was given to each obtained ratio.
The points were connected by a line. The angles formed by the lines were measured
and graphically displayed over a circle. The point of reference 0 degree was
located on the left side of the circle, giving the corresponding 90 degrees, 180 
degrees, and 240 degrees angles. The graph of the control group shows a "beach
chair" image. As soon as the CD4+ lymphocytes diminish and the CD8+ lymphocytes
increase in HIV+ patients, "the chair's headrest" descends and the "chair's
footpiece" swivels back. Given the ranks and fluctuations of the lymphocyte
subsets, their graphic display provides a better representation of the
immunological status.
