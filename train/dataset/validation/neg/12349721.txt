Will HIV / AIDS undermine democracy in South Africa?

Willan S.

PIP: This paper argues the potential of HIV/AIDS to undermine the democratic
governance of South Africa and other developing countries. It begins by assessing
the extent of the impact of HIV/AIDS on society, and from these facts it would
indicate whether democracy can be undermined. As observed in sub-Saharan Africa, 
the extent of the epidemic has the potential to cripple the country's attempt to 
establish and maintain democracy and equity. Therefore, in order to sustain
democratic governance, the following is required: strong citizen support;
powerful, committed, democratic leadership; a strong and active civil society.
Moreover, governments need to address the spread of HIV/AIDS, not only because
people are sick and dying, but also because democracy itself is threatened.
