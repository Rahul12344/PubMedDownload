Detection of staphylococcal membrane receptors on virus-infected cells by direct 
adhesin overlay.

Sanford BA, Ramsay MA.

We partially characterized the interaction between 125I-labeled surface proteins 
of Staphylococcus aureus, obtained by thermal extraction, and purified plasma
membranes from uninfected and influenza virus A/FM/1/47-infected Madin-Darby
canine kidney cells. The radioactivity profile of surface-labeled proteins,
derived from anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed a mixture
of acidic polypeptides in a peak which contained approximately 5% of the total
protein injected; adsorption with purified plasma membranes reduced radioactivity
by 5 to 7% and altered elution profiles. Using a direct adhesin overlay
procedure, we found that these surface-labeled proteins reacted with polypeptides
located on the external surface of plasma membranes which were shared by both
virus-infected and uninfected cells or were unique to virus-infected cells. Our
data may help explain the enhanced adherence of S. aureus to influenza virus
A-infected cells in vitro.
