OBJECTIVE: Previous HPV models have only included genital transmission, when
evidence suggests that transmission between several anatomical sites occurs. We
compared model predictions of population-level HPV vaccination effectiveness
against genital HPV16 infection in women, using a 1) uni-site (genital site), and
a 2) multi-site model (genital and one extragenital site).
METHODS: We developed a uni-site and a multi-site deterministic HPV transmission 
model, assuming natural immunity was either site-specific or systemic. Both
models were calibrated to genital HPV16 prevalence (5%-7.5%), whilst the
multi-site model was calibrated to HPV16 prevalence representative of oral
(0%-1%) and anal (1%-7.5%) sites. For each model, we identified 2500 parameter
sets that fit endemic genital and extragenital prevalences within pre-specified
target ranges. In the Base-case analysis, vaccination was girls-only with 40%
coverage. Vaccine efficacy was 100% for all sites with lifetime protection. The
outcome was the relative reduction in genital HPV16 prevalence among women at
post-vaccination equilibrium (RRprev). RRprev was stratified by extragenital
prevalence pre-vaccination.
RESULTS: Under assumptions of site-specific immunity, RRprev with the multi-site 
model was generally greater than with the uni-site model. Differences between the
uni-site and multi-site models were greater when transmission from the
extragenital site to the genital site was high. Under assumptions of systemic
immunity, the multi-site and uni-site models yielded similar RRprev in the
scenario without immunity after extragenital infection. In the scenario with
systemic immunity after extragenital infection, the multi-site model yielded
lower predictions of RRprev than the uni-site model.
CONCLUSIONS: Modelling genital-site only transmission may overestimate
vaccination impact if extragenital infections contribute to systemic natural
immunity or underestimate vaccination impact if a high proportion of genital
infections originate from extragenital infections. Under current understanding of
heterosexual HPV transmission and immunity, a substantial bias from using
uni-site models in predicting vaccination effectiveness against genital HPV
infection is unlikely to occur.
