Murine cytomegalovirus causes diffuse myocardial lesions in immunologically
intact young adult male BALB/cBy mice. The cardiac changes develop in and around 
the small penetrating blood vessels of the heart where perivascular and
interstitial infiltrates of macrophages and lymphocytes accumulate. Focal lesions
of the coronary vessels and the endocardium also appear. When infected mice are
depleted of CD4+ T lymphocytes, myocardial lesions fail to develop even though
virus replication in the heart is enhanced. Contrary wise, when CD4+ cells are
adoptively transferred into infected, thymectomized, irradiated, bone
marrow-repleted mice, focal perivascular necrotizing lesions of the heart
develop. Depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes fails to influence virus replication and
the development of cardiac lesions. Endothelial and endocardial cells appear to
be major sites of virus replication in the heart. Delayed hypersensitivity is
hypothesized to be the mechanism of cardiac injury in this model system.
