Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that belongs to
the nuclear receptor superfamily. In the presence of its specific ligands, AR
translocates into the nucleus, interacts with chromatin at hormone response
elements (HREs) and recruits a variety of coregulators and basal transcription
factors to regulate transcription. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)
labelling and the tandem gene array system of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), 
the interaction of AR with HREs can be visualized and studied in live cells. The 
MMTV array in nuclei can be specifically detected by DNA fluorescence in situ
hybridization (DNA FISH) and thereby specific binding of GFP-AR to the array can 
be confirmed in the presence of specific ligands. The transcriptional activity of
GFP-AR at the MMTV array can be visualized by RNA FISH in combination with
interactions of GFP-AR or its cofactors, or different components of the
transcriptional initiation complex, by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Finally,
using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), dynamic interactions of 
GFP-AR with the chromatin template can be studied. Methods to carry out these
experiments are described herein.
