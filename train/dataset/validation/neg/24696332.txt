This chapter outlines methods for the production of dengue virus (DENV) reporter 
virus particles (RVPs) and their use in assays that measure antibody-mediated
neutralization and enhancement of DENV infection. RVPs are pseudo-infectious
virions produced by complementation of a self-replicating flavivirus replicon
with the DENV structural genes in trans. RVPs harvested from transfected cells
are capable of only a single round of infection and encapsidate replicon RNA that
encodes a reporter gene used to enumerate infected cells. RVPs may be produced
using the structural genes of different DENV serotypes, genotypes, and mutants by
changing plasmids used for complementation. Further modifications are possible
including generating RVPs with varying levels of uncleaved prM protein, which
resemble either the immature or mature form of the virus. Neutralization potency 
is measured by incubating RVPs with serial dilutions of antibody, followed by
infection of target cells that express DENV attachment factors. Enhancement of
infection is measured similarly using Fc receptor-expressing cells capable of
internalizing antibody-virus complexes.
