The SCF complexes are the prototype of a superfamily of cullin-dependent
ubiquitin ligases, which regulate diverse cellular functions by promoting the
ubiquitination of a large number of regulatory and signaling proteins. The SCF
complexes are organized by the elongated scaffold protein subunit Cul1, which
interacts with the Rbx1 RING finger protein at one end and the Skp1 adaptor
protein at the other. By binding to Skp1, members of the F-box protein family are
responsible for recruiting specific substrates to the ligase machine. This
chapter describes methods that we have developed to achieve high-level expression
and purification of two recombinant SCF complexes from both insect cells and
bacteria. We emphasize the power of protein coexpression and a novel
"Split-n-Coexpress" method in producing soluble and functional recombinant
proteins and protein complexes. We propose that similar approaches can be used to
obtain large quantities of other SCF and SCF-like complexes for biochemical and
structural investigations.
