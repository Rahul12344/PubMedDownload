An unusual rotavirus strain, MG6, was isolated from a 16-month-old child admitted
to hospital with acute gastroenteritis. The virus could not be serotyped
(G-typed) by enzyme immunoassay using standard reagents specific for common
serotypes of human Group A rotaviruses. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNA derived
from the gene encoding the outer capsid protein, VP7, and deduction of the VP7
amino acid sequence indicated that this strain belonged to serotype G6, a
serotype normally associated with viruses causing disease in cattle. This was
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction typing and enzyme immunoassay using a
G6-specific monoclonal antibody. The VP4 genotype of MG6 was determined by
hybridization of its VP4 cDNA to genomic RNA isolated from standard strains of
defined P-types. This analysis, confirmed by deduced amino acid sequence
analysis, classified MG6 into the novel genotype P13. MG6, therefore, is related 
to the previously described G6P13 human strain PA169, isolated in Italy. The
emergence of strain MG6, the first human G6 rotavirus identified in Australia,
provides further evidence of reassortment between human and animal rotaviruses.
