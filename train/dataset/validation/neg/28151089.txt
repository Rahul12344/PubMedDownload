Nucleic acid recognition by toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) initiates signaling
pathways that regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines or type I
interferons, as well as many other molecules required to initialize the immune
response. The use of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) has been crucial to
emulate the recognition of DNA sequences by TLR9. Furthermore, ODN administration
to mice has shown to confer protection against a wide range of viral, bacterial, 
and parasitic pathogens. In contrast, oncogenic DNA viruses like hepatitis B
virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human papilloma virus inhibit TLR9 expression,
thus contributing to the establishment of chronic viral infections. In this
review, we will focus on TLR9 signals initiated by ODN recognition, on the
inhibition of TLR9 expression mediated by DNA oncogenic viruses, and on TLR9
expression as a relevant event in the progression to cancer, considering other
functions of this receptor, aside from viral recognition.
