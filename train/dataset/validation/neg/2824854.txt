An antiviral protein is released by mosquito cells persistently infected with
Sindbis virus. Differences in both sensitivity to and production of this
virus-specific activity were apparent in three independently produced Aedes
albopictus cell lines. This activity inhibits total viral RNA synthesis in a
time-dependent manner. The antiviral effect is maximally realized when cells are 
treated with the activity 48 h before infections. These data suggest that the
antiviral activity induces an antiviral state in treated cells which prevents the
formation or efficient function of viral RNA-synthesizing complexes.
