The crystal structure of a mutant T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha domain containing
a grafted third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) from a different V
alpha was determined at 2.3 A resolution by molecular replacement using the
wild-type V alpha structure as a search model. Like the wild-type V alpha domain,
the mutant crystallized as a homodimer very similar to TCR V alpha V beta and
antibody V(L)V(H) heterodimers, with the CDR loops disposed to form part of the
antigen-binding site. However, the relative orientation of the two chains in the 
mutant V alpha homodimer differs from that in the wild-type by a rotation of 14
degrees such that the buried surface area in the dimer interface of the mutant is
140 A2 less than in the wild-type. While the residues forming the interface are
essentially the same in the two structures, there are only four pairs of
interface hydrogen bonds in the case of the mutant compared with eight for the
wild-type. These results suggest that multiple relative orientations of the V
alpha and V beta domains of TCRs may be possible, providing a significant
contribution to TCR combining site diversity.
