BACKGROUND: The authors have previously reported genomic subtypes of chronic
fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) based on expression of 88
human genes.
AIM: To attempt to reproduce these findings, determine the specificity of this
signature to CFS/ME, and test for associations between CFS/ME subtype and
infection.
METHODS: Expression levels of 88 human genes were determined in blood of 62 new
patients with idiopathic CFS/ME (according to Fukuda criteria), six patients with
Q-fever-associated CFS/ME from the Birmingham Q-fever outbreak (according to
Fukuda criteria), 14 patients with endogenous depression (according to DSM-IV
criteria) and 29 normal blood donors.
RESULTS: In patients with CFS/ME, differential expression was confirmed for all
88 genes. Q-CFS/ME had similar patterns of gene expression to idiopathic CFS/ME. 
Gene expression in patients with endogenous depression was similar to that in the
normal controls, except for upregulation of five genes (APP, CREBBP, GNAS, PDCD2 
and PDCD6). Clustering of combined gene data in CFS/ME patients for this and the 
authors' previous study (117 CFS/ME patients) revealed genomic subtypes with
distinct differences in SF36 scores, clinical phenotypes, severity and
geographical distribution. Antibody testing for Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus, 
Coxiella burnetii and parvovirus B19 revealed evidence of subtype-specific
relationships for Epstein-Barr virus and enterovirus, the two most common
infectious triggers of CFS/ME.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the involvement of these genes in CFS/ME.
