Alterations in tRNA isoaccepting species during erythroid differentiation of the 
Friend leukemia cell.

Lin VK, Agris PF.

The chromatographic profiles of isoaccepting tRNAs were analyzed at five time
points during the 96 hr, dimethylsulfoxide induced, erythroid-like
differentiation of Friend leukemia cells. Sixty-four isoaccepting species of tRNA
for 16 amino acids were resolved by RPC-5 chromatography. The relative amounts of
tRNAphe, tRNAile, and tRNAval species were maintained by the cells during
differentiation; whereas the relative amounts of some of the isoacceptor tRNAs
for the other 13 amino acids changed significantly. Fluctuations in amounts of
isoacceptors occurred between 36 and 72 hr after addition of dimethysulfoxide,
corresponding to globin mRNA appearance and hemoglobin synthesis, respectively.
In most cases, thepredominant tRNA isoacceptors of uninduced cells were retained 
throughout differentiation. Notable exceptions were tRNA species for threonine,
proline, and methionine. Some of the isoacceptors occurring in relatively smaller
amounts were not expressed at all times. These changes possibly reflect the
cell's functional adaptation of tRNA in differentiation for hemoglobin synthesis.
