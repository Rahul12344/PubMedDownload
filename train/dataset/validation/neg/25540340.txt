A ranavirus associated with mass mortalities in wild water frogs (Pelophylax
spp.) and other amphibians in the Netherlands since 2010 was isolated, and its
complete genome sequence was determined. The virus has a genome of 107,772 bp and
shows 96.5% sequence identity with the common midwife toad virus from Spain.
