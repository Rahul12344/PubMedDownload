Acute cerebellar syndrome in infectious mononucleosis: documentation of two cases
with Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Kramer DS, Smitnik LM, John K, Drake ME Jr.

Acute cerebellar ataxia has been described occasionally with infectious
mononucleosis. Two additional cases are reported with serologic identification of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. As with
previously described cases, the outcome was benign, and examination and
laboratory studies did not indicate diffuse neurologic involvement. Visual and
brainstem auditory-evoked responses were normal. Electroencephalograms (EEG)
demonstrated 14 and 6 per second positive spikes in both patients. This pattern
is considered a normal variant and has been recorded from depth electrodes and
reported with deep midline lesions. These cases support the prognosis of benign
cerebellar involvement in infectious mononucleosis and suggest that evidence of
EBV infection be sought in patients with acute ataxia. The significance of 14/sec
and 6/sec positive EEG spikes is uncertain.
