Experiments with monoclonal antibodies raised against two laboratory strains of
Sindbis virus, SB and SIN, suggested the existence of a strain-specific
neutralizing antigenic site (E2-b) on the E2 glycoprotein. A comparison of
monoclonal antibody binding patterns and E2 glycoprotein gene sequences of six
laboratory strains distinguished three different configurations of E2-b that
correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at position 216 of the E2
glycoprotein. Further study of neutralization escape mutants selected with
E2-b-specific antibodies confirmed that amino acid 216 is a major determinant of 
the E2-b antigenic site. Eight of nine mutants showed a coding change at position
216. One neutralization escape mutation created a new glycosylation site at
position 213 and resulted in an E2 protein with an altered migration rate in
SDS-PAGE. The neutralization escape mutants studied included amino acid
substitutions not found in the laboratory strains that revealed differing binding
requirements for two E2-b-specific monoclonal antibodies. The E2-b site is
contrasted with the E2-c neutralizing antigenic site described previously (R.A.
Olmsted, W.J. Meyer, and R.E. Johnston, 1986, Virology 148, 245-254).
