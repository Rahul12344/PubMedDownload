[Five years experience with an influenza subunit vaccine (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Majer M, Kindt H, Mettier B.

After a short review on development, production, and assay of influenza vaccines 
the authors discuss the special properties of influenza virus subunit vaccine
which contains the purified protective antigens of the influenza virus. The
results of pre-clinical and clinical studies allow the conclusion that subunit
vaccine is better tolerated than and at least as potent as conventional influenza
vaccines. It therefore seems to be especially suited for annual re-vaccinations
of persons at high risk.
