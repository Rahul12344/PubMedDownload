The objective of this project was to describe longitudinal change in chronic
hepatitis C virologic reponse using time-to-event (TTE) analysis and to identify 
patient characteristics that determine the dynamics of this change. We compiled
demographic, clinical, and genetic data from 715 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2a and ribavirin. TTE
modelling described the time between antiviral treatment initiation and the first
observation of undetectable HCV RNA. A lognormal TTE model was selected to
describe time to first undetectable HCV RNA. The identified predictors of
prolonged time to achieve undetectable HCV RNA include HCV genotype 1, low
pre-treatment ALT level, older age, or with elevated baseline haemoglobin level. 
In conclusion, a cohort of patients with low probability of achieving SVR can be 
identified. This project identifies patients with a low risk of responding to
PEG-IFN alfa-2a and ribavirin combination.
