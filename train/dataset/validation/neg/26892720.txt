The objective of this study was to evaluate the stimulatory effects of Bacillus
amyloliquefaciens SQR9 on dendritic cells (DCs) and to verify its ability to
enhance the immune response by modulating DC maturation. The results demonstrated
that B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 can adhere to the nasal epithelium and be taken up
by DCs in the nasal mucosa, thereby inducing DC maturation and resulting in
increased CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHCII expression and cytokine secretion. The
frequencies of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and CD69(+) memory T cells were
increased in spleens after nasal immunization with virus plus B.
amyloliquefaciens SQR9 compared to immunization with inactivated H9N2 AIV alone. 
Moreover, the levels of sIgA in the nasal cavity, the trachea, and the lung and
the levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in serum were significantly increased in mice 
administered WIV plus SQR9 compared to mice administered H9N2 WIV alone. The
results of this study demonstrated that B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 can stimulate
DC maturation to effectively induce an immune response. In conclusion, an
effective immune response may result from the uptake of H9N2 by DCs in the nasal 
mucosa, thereby stimulating DC maturation and migration to cervical lymph nodes
to initiate immune response.
