Although Hodgkin's disease (HD) is not usually associated with congenital or
acquired immunodeficiency disorders, recent evidence would suggest a
statistically significant increase in HD among individuals infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the setting of underlying HIV infection,
clinical and pathologic characteristics of HD may differ from usual expectations.
Thus, 70%-100% of HIV-infected patients with HD present with systemic "B"
symptoms. Likewise, disseminated, stage III or IV disease is reported in
approximately 75%-90%. Bone marrow is a common site of extranodal HD, occurring
in 40%-50%. Complete response rates after multiagent chemotherapy range from
approximately 45% to 70%, although median survival has been only in the range of 
approximately 18 months. Hematologic toxicity from multiagent chemotherapy may be
substantial, even with the use of hematopoietic growth factor support. It is
apparent that new strategies of therapeutic intervention must be explored.
