Partial nucleotide sequences of amplification products obtained from four
European apple stem grooving virus (ASGV) isolates using degenerate primers
showed 80 to 85% similarity with the published ASGV sequence of a Japanese strain
but 98 to 100% identities among themselves. Based on these sequences, two
ASGV-specific primers (ASGV4F-ASGV4R) were designed to amplify a 574-bp fragment 
located in the putative viral RNA polymerase. With these primers, six European
and five American ASGV isolates, maintained in herbaceous hosts (Chenopodium
quinoa, Nicotiana glutinosa, and N. occidentalis) or in apple trees, were readily
detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using these
specific ASGV primers, dsRNA preparations have been shown to constitute good
templates for reliable amplification of ASGV sequences from leaves and bark
tissues of apple trees, both in a two-step RT-PCR protocol and in the one-step
Titan One-Tube RT-PCR. System. Furthermore, the one-step RT-PCR system allowed a 
specific amplification of ASGV sequences directly from clarified crude extracts
of leaves and bark tissues of apple trees during both active growth and the
dormant season.
