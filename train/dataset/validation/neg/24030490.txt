The CCR5 chemokine receptor acts as a co-receptor for HIV-1 viral entry. Here we 
report the 2.7 angstrom-resolution crystal structure of human CCR5 bound to the
marketed HIV drug maraviroc. The structure reveals a ligand-binding site that is 
distinct from the proposed major recognition sites for chemokines and the viral
glycoprotein gp120, providing insights into the mechanism of allosteric
inhibition of chemokine signaling and viral entry. A comparison between CCR5 and 
CXCR4 crystal structures, along with models of co-receptor-gp120-V3 complexes,
suggests that different charge distributions and steric hindrances caused by
residue substitutions may be major determinants of HIV-1 co-receptor selectivity.
These high-resolution insights into CCR5 can enable structure-based drug
discovery for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.
