From 1987 through 1991, 2687 intravenous drug users recruited at three AIDS
information centres in the Region of Valencia (Spain) were interviewed about drug
use and sexual behaviour and subsequently tested for HIV-1 antibody. The overall 
seroprevalence was high, 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.8-51.9%). There
were no differences by gender, but HIV-1 infection was related to older age and
city of residence. After adjustment by means of logistic regression age (odds
ratio [OR] = 1.80), sharing of injection equipment (OR = 2.16), duration of
addiction (OR = 6.59) and prostitution (OR = 1.77) were significantly associated 
with HIV-1 prevalence. High educational level was inversely related to HIV-1
status (OR = 0.43) and a decreasing trend of prevalence with time was observed.
