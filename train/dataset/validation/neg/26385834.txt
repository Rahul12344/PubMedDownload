Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) splicing has to be strictly
controlled to ensure the balanced production of the unspliced and all differently
spliced viral RNAs. Splicing at the major 59 splice site (59ss) that is used for 
the synthesis of all spliced RNAs is modulated by the local RNA structure and
binding of regulatory SR proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the suboptimal
sequence complementarity between this 59ss and U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) also 
contributes to prevent excessive splicing. Analysis of a large set of HIV-1
sequences revealed that all three regulatory features of the 59ss region (RNA
structure, SR protein binding and sequence complementarity with U1 snRNA) are
highly conserved amongst virus isolates, which supports their importance.
Combined mutations that destabilize the local RNA structure, remove binding sites
for inhibitory SR proteins and optimize the U1 snRNA complementarity resulted in 
almost complete splicing and accordingly reduced virus replication.
