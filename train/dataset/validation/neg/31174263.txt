BACKGROUND: Nail changes, including onychomadesis (nail shedding) and Beau's
line, following hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) are a common emergence at the
stage of late complications of HFMD. However, the exact mechanism is still
unknown. Therefore, we conducted this study to elucidate the mechanism of nail
changes following HFMD.
METHODS: We collected 11 patients suffering from onychomadesis following HFMD.
Nail samples from all of them were collected. Real time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing for human enteroviruses (HEV)
were performed. Throat swabs for RT-PCR and sequencing for HEV were performed for
three cases.
RESULTS: RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of Coxackievirus A6 (CVA6) in nail
samples from three patients and one with Echovirus.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we believe that the major cause of onychomadesis
following HFMD is that certain novel viruses, mostly CVA6, are virulent and may
damage nail matrix. Direct injury caused by cutaneous lesions of HFMD around nail
matrix is a minor cause. There are still other virulent HEV which may result in
onychomadesis. In addition, the novel strain of CVA6 also causes atypical
clinical presentations, such as adult involvement and delayed-onset palmar and
plantar desquamation. Physicians should be familiar with atypical presentations
caused by novel viruses to avoid misdiagnosis and even inform patients of the
possibility of onychomadesis that may take place weeks later to reassure
patients.
