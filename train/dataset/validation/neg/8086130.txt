OBJECTIVE: To determine the serum levels of the soluble form of the CD30 (sCD30) 
activation molecule in the early phase of HIV-1 infection, and to investigate the
possible correlation with evolution to AIDS.
METHODS: sCD30 values were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) on serum samples collected at the time of the first evidence of HIV-1
infection in 110 individuals with a median follow-up of 56 months (range, 12-88
months), at the A1 (74 cases) or A2 (36 cases) stages of the 1993 revised Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention classification. The data were evaluated using 
established clinical and immunological parameters, including circulating CD4+
T-cell count. The controls were 110 blood donors and 51 HIV-1-negative subjects
belonging to groups at risk for HIV-1 infection.
RESULTS: Elevated sCD30 levels (> 20 U/ml) were found in 83.6% of HIV-1-infected 
cases and in 47% of at-risk seronegatives. Data analysis revealed that
HIV-1-infected patients with higher sCD30 levels (> 35 U/ml) experienced faster
disease progression (P = 0.0002). This was also the case in patients at the
earliest stage (A1) of HIV infection (P = 0.0027). In these latter cases the
predictive value of sCD30 was independent of the initial absolute number of
circulating CD4+ lymphocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of sCD30 are increased in the large majority of
patients in the early phase of HIV-1 infection and represent an indicator of
progression to AIDS independent of other prognostic parameters.
