Etiology of rheumatoid arthritis.

Kouri T.

Definite genetic associations with immunological cooperative HLA-D(R) antigens
have been demonstrated for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Microbial etiology has not 
been proven, but some hope for the supporters of this view is still given by
small viruses, plasmids of enteric bacteria or perhaps oncogen-like
DNA-sequences. Yet, electrophoretical analysis of membrane proteins or surface
glycoproteins of RA synovial cells does not show any differences compared to
reference cells. Autoimmunity to several tissue elements has been demonstrated,
but most of it is of secondary nature. Antigenicities of type II and III
collagens are probably only contributory factors for HLA-DR4 positive
individuals. Proteoglycans or minor cartilage collagens have not been extensively
studied, so far. Endocrine, dietary or psychological influences might be
triggering events for otherwise 'preloaded' individuals.
