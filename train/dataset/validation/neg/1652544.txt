The causal lesions by VPH in the cervix, are associated to cancer. Currently 56
different subtypes have been isolated, from which, the 16, 18, 31, 33, 35 and 39 
are more frequently related with the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; from
here derives the importance of opportune treatment. The objective of this paper
is to evaluate VPH of the cervix opportune treatment with cryosurgery. Seventy
five patients were analyzed, from April 1988 to May 1990 with diagnosis of
cervical VPH, by cytology, colposcopy and histopathology; in whom cryosurgery
with double freezing technique, was practiced; and were evaluated ever six
months, during two years with cytology and colposcopy. Whenever there was
persistence or recurrence, cryosurgery was used again; doing this even three
times, previously discarding intraepithelial cancer. Seventy seven per cent of
the patients received only one session; 16% two, and 7% three. At the six months 
review, it was found that 92% of the cases were negative, and 8% with
persistence; at 12 months, 89% negative and 11% with recurrences; at 18 months,
93% negative, 3% with persistence and 4% with recurrence; at 24 months, 96%
negative and 4% with recurrence. It is concluded that cryosurgery is efficacious 
in the treatment of these lesions, easy to use, well tolerated, with minimal side
effects, it does not require anesthesia and is of a low cost.
