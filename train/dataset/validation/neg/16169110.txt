In this study we showed that the virulent Moscow strain of Ectromelia virus
(ECTV-MOS) infection leads to induction of apoptosis in the BALB/c mouse central 
nervous system. ECTV-MOS-infected cells and inflammation sites were found in
brain parenchyma between 5 and 15 days after footpad infection with ECTV-MOS.
Infected cells consisted of microglia and monocytes, astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes and these type of cells underwent apoptosis within 5-15 days
post infection (d.p.i.). The highest number of apoptotic cells was found at 5 and
10 d.p.i. and represented mainly microglia (61.4% and 38.6% of apoptotic cells,
respectively) and astrocytes (21% and 8.9%, respectively). The number of
apoptotic oligodendrocytes was 5.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Fluorometric assays
demonstrated involvement of caspase-1, -3 and -8 but not caspase-9 in apoptosis
in ECTV-MOS-infected mouse brains. Expression of Fas/FasL was significantly
increased on ECTV-MOS-infected cells between 5 and 15 d.p.i., whereas Fas was
up-regulated also on the surrounding, non-infected cells. Taking together we may 
conclude that ECTV-MOS infection of microglia and astrocytes leads to local
inflammation resulting in Fas/FasL up-regulation and apoptosis, which limits
mouse central nervous system infection with ECTV-MOS.
