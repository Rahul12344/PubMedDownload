The 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak demonstrated the epidemic potential of Ebola
virus and highlighted the need for counter strategies. Monoclonal antibody
(mAb)-based therapies hold promise as treatment options for Ebola virus
infections. However, production of clinical-grade mAbs is labor intensive, and
immunity is short lived. Conversely, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated mAb
gene transfer provides the host with a genetic blueprint to manufacture mAbs in
vivo, leading to steady release of antibody over many months. Here we demonstrate
that AAV-mediated expression of nonneutralizing mAb 5D2 or 7C9 confers 100%
protection against mouse-adapted Ebola virus infection, while neutralizing mAb
2G4 was 83% protective. A 2-component cocktail, AAV-2G4/AAV-5D2, provided
complete protection when administered 7 days prior to challenge and was partially
protective with a 3-day lead time. Finally, AAV-mAb therapies provided sustained 
protection from challenge 5 months following AAV administration. AAV-mAb may be a
viable alternative strategy for vaccination against emerging infectious diseases.
