Complete nucleotide sequence of the haemagglutinin gene from a human influenza
virus of the Hong Kong subtype.

Both GW, Sleigh MJ.

The complete nucleotide sequence has been determined for a cloned double-stranded
DNA copy of the haemagglutinin gene from the human influenza strain
A/NT/60/68/29C, a laboratory-isolated variant of A/NT/60/68, an early strain of
the Hong Kong subtype. The gene is 1765 nucleotides long and contains information
sufficient to code for a protein of 566 amino acids, which includes a hydrophobic
leader peptide (16 residues), HA1 (328), HA2 (221) and an arginine residue which 
joins the HA subunits. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence for 29C
haemagglutinin with protein sequence data available for HA from other influenza
strains shows that no potential coding information is lost by processing of the
mRNA. A comparison of the amino acid sequences predicted from the gene sequences 
for 29C and fowl plague virus haemagglutinins, (1) indicates the extent to which 
changes can occur in the primary sequence of different regions of the protein,
while maintaining essential structure and function.
