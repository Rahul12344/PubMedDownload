BACKGROUND: B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) gene,
which plays a critical role in directional differentiation and proliferation of
cells, is significant in malignant transformation of cells. The aim of this study
is to investigate the levels of Bmi-1 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
to preliminarily analyze the correlation between Bmi-1 and the development of
NSCLC tissue.
METHODS: The expression of Bmi-1 was detected in 25 NSCLC tissues as well as in
the normal paracancerous lung tissues by immunofluorescence technique and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Immunofluorescently, the positive expression of Bmi-1 proteins was
revealed in nucleus of tumor cells in 76%(19 /25) of NSCLC tissue but not in
paracancerous lung tissues. RT-PCR results showed that the expression of Bmi-1 in
lung cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in paracancerous lung
tissues (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Bmi-1 is over expressed in NSCLC and may be associated with the
oncogenesis and development of lung cancer.
