As a discipline, phylogenetics is becoming transformed by a flood of molecular
data. These data allow broad questions to be asked about the history of life, but
also present difficult statistical and computational problems. Bayesian inference
of phylogeny brings a new perspective to a number of outstanding issues in
evolutionary biology, including the analysis of large phylogenetic trees and
complex evolutionary models and the detection of the footprint of natural
selection in DNA sequences.
