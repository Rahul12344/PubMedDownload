There has been an increase in the incidence rates in recent years of sexually
transmitted diseases within the cohort of males who have sex with other men
(MSM). An outbreak of acute hepatitis due to the hepatitis A virus was reported
in 2017, both nationally and internationally. The sexual practices of this cohort
are strongly implicated as a mechanism of infection. This situation was assessed 
in our health district and the incidence rate of this disease in 2017 was higher 
than usual. MSM practices are the potential cause of transmission in 52% of the
cases (12/23). This situation triggers a change in the contagion risk factors for
this disease. Therefore, we believe that we must provide health education and act
within the MSM group to avoid new outbreaks in the future.
