A new plum pox potyvirus (PPV)-based vector has been constructed for the
expression of full-length individual foreign proteins. The foreign sequences are 
cloned between the NIb replicase and capsid protein (CP) cistrons. The
heterologous protein is split from the rest of the potyviral polyprotein by
cleavage at the site that originally separated the NIb and CP proteins and at an 
additional NIa protease recognition site engineered at its amino-terminal end.
This vector (PPV-NK) has been used to clone different genes, engendering stable
chimeras with practical applications. We have constructed a chimera expressing
high levels of jellyfish green fluorescent protein, which can be very useful for 
the study of PPV molecular biology. The VP60 structural protein of rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was also successfully expressed by making use of
the PPV-NK vector. Inoculation of extracts from VP60-expressing plants induced a 
remarkable immune response against RHDV in rabbits, its natural host. Moreover,
these animals were protected against a lethal challenge with RHDV.
