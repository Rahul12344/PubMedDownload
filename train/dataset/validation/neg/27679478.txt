The Influenza Research Database (IRD) is a U.S. National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored Bioinformatics Resource Center dedicated to
providing bioinformatics support for influenza virus research. IRD facilitates
the research and development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics against
influenza virus by providing a comprehensive collection of influenza-related data
integrated from various sources, a growing suite of analysis and visualization
tools for data mining and hypothesis generation, personal workbench spaces for
data storage and sharing, and active user community support. Here, we describe
the recent improvements in IRD including the use of cloud and high performance
computing resources, analysis and visualization of user-provided sequence data
with associated metadata, predictions of novel variant proteins, annotations of
phenotype-associated sequence markers and their predicted phenotypic effects,
hemagglutinin (HA) clade classifications, an automated tool for HA subtype
numbering conversion, linkouts to disease event data and the addition of host
factor and antiviral drug components. All data and tools are freely available
without restriction from the IRD website at https://www.fludb.org.
