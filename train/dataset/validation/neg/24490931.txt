Meat and meat products may be the source of various pathogenic and potentially
pathogenic agents for humans. We ascertained the occurrence of Mycobacterium
avium subsp. paratuberculosis, subsp. avium, and subsp. hominissuis, and
hepatitis E virus in retail raw meat products. The DNA of at least one of the
target M. avium subspecies was detected in 26 (29.2%) of 89 analyzed samples of
meat products. Fourteen (15.7%), 1 (1.1%), and 17 (19.1%) samples contained the
DNA of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, subsp. avium, and subsp.
hominissuis, respectively. The number of mycobacterial cells per gram of meat
products determined by real-time quantitative PCR ranged from 1.15 × 10(2) to
6.97 × 10(3). Mycobacterium chitae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were
isolated from three (3.4%) samples. Culture examination was not positive for any 
M. avium subspecies. Hepatitis E virus RNA was not detected in any of the
samples.
