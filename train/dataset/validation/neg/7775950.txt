Self-limited involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is a relatively
common complication of primary infection with human herpesvirus six (HHV-6) in
normal children. We describe an HIV-infected infant who developed fulminant
encephalitis as a complication of HHV-6 infection. Immunohistochemical staining
of CNS tissue demonstrated productive infection of all CNS cell-types. Analysis
of the infected brain tissue by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the
presence of a dense HHV-6 infection in the tissue, and demonstrated that the
virus present in the CNS tissue was predominantly the A variant of HHV-6. This is
the first demonstration of invasive tissue disease caused by HHV-6 in an
HIV-infected infant.
