The diagnosis and management of the following non-infectious vulvar ulcers are
reviewed: vulvar aphthae in adult and pediatric patients, aphthae associated with
Behçet's disease, vulvar ulcers resulting from Crohn's disease, and vulvar ulcers
associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. There are many resources 
providing excellent reviews of infectious ulcers; therefore this topic will not
be covered here.
