The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex responsible for the
degradation of most intracellular proteins, including crucial to cell cycle
regulation, cell growth, and apoptosis. Bortezomib (Vercade; formerly known as
PS-341) is a novel dipeptide boronic acid that is the first proteasome inhibitor 
to have progressed to clinical trials. Below we discuss the mechanism of
bortezomib for cancer therapy, review the clinical data, and introduce the potent
effect on ATL cells.
