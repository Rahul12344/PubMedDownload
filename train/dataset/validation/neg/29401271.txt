Background: Our understanding of influenza A virus transmission between humans
and pigs is limited.
Methods: Beginning in 2015, we used a One Health approach and serial sampling to 
prospectively study 299 swine workers and 100 controls, their 9000 pigs, and 6
pig farm environments in China for influenza A viruses (IAVs) using molecular,
culture, and immunological techniques. Study participants were closely monitored 
for influenza-like illness (ILI) events.
Results: Upon enrollment, swine workers had higher serum neutralizing antibody
titers against swine H1N1 and higher nasal wash total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and 
specific IgA titers against swine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Over a period of 12
months, IAVs were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction in 46 of 396 (11.6%) environmental swabs, 235 of 3300 (7.1%) pig oral
secretion, 23 of 396 (5.8%) water, 20 of 396 (5.1%) aerosol, and 19 of 396 (4.8%)
fecal-slurry specimens. Five of 32 (15.6%) participants with ILI events had
nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were positive for IAV, and 17 (53.1%)
demonstrated 4-fold rises in neutralization titers against a swine virus.
Reassorted Eurasian avian-lineage H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09-like, and swine-lineage H3N2
viruses were identified in pig farms. The A(H1N1)pdm09-like H1N1 viruses
identified in swine were nearly genetically identical to the human H1N1 viruses
isolated from the participants with ILI.
Conclusions: There was considerable evidence of A(H1N1)pdm09-like, swine-lineage 
H1N1, and swine-lineage H3N2 viruses circulating, likely reassorting, and likely 
crossing species within the pig farms. These data suggest that stronger
surveillance for novel influenza virus emergence within swine farms is
imperative.
