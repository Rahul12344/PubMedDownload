Background: Postexposure chemoprophylaxis can prevent human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection in risk health care workers; however routine adoption of
these practices by the workers has been limited.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 311 health care workers of
Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital between February and March 2016. Data 
was collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire and analysed
using STATA 12.
Results: In all, 83% of the participants had adequate knowledge of postexposure
prophylaxis for HIV. All the respondents had heard about postexposure prophylaxis
for HIV; however, only 37 (22.4%) workers know the definition of the postexposure
prophylaxis. Among study participants, the majority of them, 272 (87.5%), knew
the preferable time to initiate postexposure chemoprophylaxis. A significant
number of the workers (43.4%) had an unfavorable attitude towards postexposure
prophylaxis. Among 53 workers with a potential exposure to HIV, 38 (71.7%) took
postexposure chemoprophylaxis and only 26 (44.8%) completed taking postexposure
prophylaxis correctly.
Conclusion: In all, most of the health care workers had adequate knowledge about 
postexposure prophylaxis against HIV/AIDS. The result shows that a significant
number of individuals had a negative attitude and poor practice with regard to
postexposure prophylaxis. Therefore, formal training that aims to improve
attitudes and support to improve postexposure prophylaxis implementation and
completion are needed. We would recommend the establishment of appropriate
guidelines and the supply chain to ensure the availability of postexposure
prophylaxis drugs for the protection of healthcare workers with potential high
risk exposure to HIV.
