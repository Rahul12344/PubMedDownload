The design of immunogens that elicit broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs) has been a major obstacle to HIV-1 vaccine development. One approach to
assess potential immunogens is to use mice expressing precursors of human bnAbs
as vaccination models. The bnAbs of the VRC01-class derive from the IGHV1-2
immunoglobulin heavy chain and neutralize a wide spectrum of HIV-1 strains via
targeting the CD4 binding site of the envelope glycoprotein gp120. We now
describe a mouse vaccination model that allows a germline human IGHV1-2(∗)02
segment to undergo normal V(D)J recombination and, thereby, leads to the
generation of peripheral B cells that express a highly diverse repertoire of
VRC01-related receptors. When sequentially immunized with modified gp120
glycoproteins designed to engage VRC01 germline and intermediate antibodies,
IGHV1-2(∗)02-rearranging mice, which also express a VRC01-antibody precursor
light chain, can support the affinity maturation of VRC01 precursor antibodies
into HIV-neutralizing antibody lineages.
