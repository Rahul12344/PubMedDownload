The health and survival of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are
affected by multiple factors, one of the most important being the interaction
between viral pathogens and infestations of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa
destructor. Currently, the only effective strategy available for mitigating the
impact of viral infections is the chemical control of mite populations.
Unfortunately, the use of in-hive acaricides comes at a price, as they can
produce sublethal effects that are difficult to quantify, but may ultimately be
as damaging as the mites they are used to treat. The goal of this study was to
investigate the physiological and immunological effects of the formamidine
acaricide amitraz and its primary metabolite in honey bees. Using flock house
virus as a model for viral infection, this study found that exposure to a
formamidine acaricide may have a negative impact on the ability of honey bees to 
tolerate viral infection. Furthermore, this work has demonstrated that amitraz
and its metabolite significantly alter honey bee cardiac function, most likely
through interaction with octopamine receptors. The results suggest a potential
drawback to the in-hive use of amitraz and raise intriguing questions about the
relationship between insect cardiac function and disease tolerance.
