Evidence for the presence of a genome-linked protein in infectious flacherie
virus.

Hashimoto Y, Watanabe A, Kawase S.

The genomic RNA of infectious flacherie virus (IFV), an insect picornavirus, was 
shown to contain a covalently attached substance which can be labeled with
125I-Bolton and Hunter reagent. This substance was found to be a protein
covalently linked to the virus genome, because it cosedimented and was copurified
with the viral RNA and was degraded by proteinase K but not by RNases. The
molecular weight of the protein was found to be 11,500 in the sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein apparently corresponds
to viral protein genome-linked (VPg) detected in mammalian picornaviruses,
because it was not required for the synthesis of viral proteins in a cell-free
translation system of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and because it was not
immunochemically related to the virus capsid proteins. The results presented here
leave a possibility that insect picornavirus also replicates its RNA by using VPg
as a primer as reported for mammalian picornaviruses. These observations on VPg
of an insect picornavirus are discussed in the view point of comparative
virology.
