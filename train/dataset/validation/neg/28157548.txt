Previous in vitro studies have shown that the HIV-1 virus can alter the
cytokine/chemokine profile of polarized macrophages which may lead to their
increased susceptibility to viral infection. Here, we found that M2 monocyte
derived macrophages (MDM) were significantly more permissive to productive
infection by R5-tropic HIV-1 strains, including transmitted founder (T/F)
viruses, than M1 MDM. Previous in vitro studies by our lab showed that regulatory
T cells (Tregs) suppress HIV-1 infection in non-Treg CD4 T cells. Here, we
investigated potential inhibitory effects of Tregs on HIV-1 infection of
polarized MDM. We found that Tregs significantly increased HIV-1 infection in M1 
and M2 MDM via a mechanism that was cell contact dependent. These findings
suggest a potential role for Tregs in HIV-1 infection of tissue resident
macrophages of M1 and M2 phenotype, which may contribute to the establishment and
pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease.
