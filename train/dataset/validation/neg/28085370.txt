The packing of a genome in virions is a topic of intense current interest in
biology and biological physics. The area is dominated by allometric scaling
relations that connect, e.g., the length of the encapsulated genome and the size 
of the corresponding virion capsid. Here we report scaling laws obtained from
extensive experiments of packing of a macroscopic wire within rigid
three-dimensional spherical and nonspherical cavities that can shed light on the 
details of the genome packing in virions. We show that these results obtained
with crumpled wires are comparable to those from a large compilation of
biological data from several classes of virions.
