Identification of the in vitro translation products of adenovirus mRNA by
immunoprecipitation.

Oberg B, Saborio J, Persson T, Everitt E, Philipson L.

Adenovirus type 2 mRNA was translated in S30 extracts from Ehrlich ascites and
wheat embryo cells. The in vitro products were identified by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-gel electrophoresis after immunoprecipitation with specific antisera in
the presence of urea. Seven virion polypeptides could be identified by
immunoprecipitation. Three of these appear to be precursors to polypeptides of
the virion. mRNA isolated late in adenovirus infection was separated into three
size classes by zonal sedimentation. Material sedimenting at 26S was translated
into polypeptides corresponding to the largest virion polypeptides II to IV, a
22S fraction corresponding to polypeptide V, and smaller polypeptides and a 15S
fraction corresponding to polypeptide IX. A significant amount of polypeptide IX 
was also synthesized by the 26S and 22S RNA.
