Although Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is known to be accompanied by
malignancies, cases with hepatobiliary cancer are extremely rare. A 62-year-old
man with palpable purpura rapidly extending to both lower legs was admitted to
our hospital. He was undergoing follow-up for cirrhosis caused by chronic
hepatitis B virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He had renal
dysfunction with hematuria and proteinuria and abdominal pain. Based on the
clinical presentation and skin biopsy findings, he was diagnosed with HSP. The
administration of steroids resulted in the rapid improvement of the patient's
symptoms and he was discharged 12 days after admission.
