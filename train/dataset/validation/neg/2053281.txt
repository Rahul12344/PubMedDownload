Expression, ribosomal frameshifting, and proteolytic processing of HIV-1 GAG and 
POL proteins were investigated in heterologous mammalian cells in order to
elucidate the influence of the cellular background on these events. DNA fragments
encoded by the gag and pol region were expressed in two rodent cell lines, LTK-
and BHK. Both stably transfected cell lines continuously produce recombinant
proteins which react with HIV-specific antisera. The GAG precursor and a 39-kDa
proteolytic fragment thereof were the major recombinant proteins detected.
Expression of the gag-pol region leads to the production of the GAG-POL
precursor. Ribosomal frameshifting at the HIV-1 shifty sequence to a typical
extent could be positively demonstrated by an enzyme assay. Despite the presence 
of the viral protease within the GAG-POL precursors, proteolytic processing of
the HIV-derived polyproteins was extremely inefficient. The efficiency could not 
be enhanced by overexpression of the HIV-1 protease encoding region.
