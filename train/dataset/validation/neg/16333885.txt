Cells from ovarioule tissues of the Egyptian cotton leaf worm, Spodoptera
littoralis (SL 96) were established, identified and characterized comparing with 
other lepidopteran cell lines using isozymes, karyotyping, RAPD PCR, and
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polypeptide PAGE profile. Comparison of the
number of chromosomes and PAGE profiles; also the isozymes profiles demonstrate
the possibility to distinguish the cell lines by those analyses and having a
distinguishable finger print for every cell line. A complete replication of the
S. littoralis granulovirus (SpliGV), nucleopolyherovirus (SpliNPV), and
Phthorimaea operculella granulovirus (PhopGV) was obtained in vitro by both viral
infection and DNA transfection in the S. littoralis (S196) cell line. Spli-GV and
PhopGV multiplied extensively during several passages in S196 cells at 19 degrees
C. Virus infected cells were incubated at 19 degrees C for the first 4 hours and 
then at .27 degrees C for the rest of the experiment (20 days). Generally, all
the three viral multiplications proceeded at the same rate approximately.
Comparison of Spli GV progenies multiplied either in vivo or in vitro, using
electron microscopy and restriction profile analysis, showed their identity.
Viral infections were detected also by specific prepared nucleic probes.
