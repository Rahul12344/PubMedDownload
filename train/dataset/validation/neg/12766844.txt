Without an effective therapeutic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine,
providing cost-effective, minimally toxic antiretroviral therapy to the many
individuals already infected with HIV-1 is a global priority. Implementation of a
structured treatment interruption (STI) regimen may be a promising intervention
for HIV-1 infection. We adopted this approach out of necessity for 3 severely
immunocompromised African children naive to therapy, and increases in the T
lymphocyte count and improved quality and sustainability of life 2 years after
initiation of the STI regimen were noted.
