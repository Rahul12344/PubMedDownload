We analysed the presence of respiratory tract viruses in 206 elderly people (more
than 65 years old). To identify viruses we used immunofluorescence method. The
study revealed respiratory virus infection in about one third of examined
patients. We found the most frequent infection with parainfluenza viruses. We
found also more frequent prevalence of respiratory viruses in the oldest subgroup
(more than 75 years old). No correlation between presence of respiratory viruses 
and smoking, diabetes or congestive heart failure was found.
