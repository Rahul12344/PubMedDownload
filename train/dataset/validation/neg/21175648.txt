BACKGROUND: Lookback is considered when human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
detected in a repeat blood donor in case the immediately previous negative
donation was donated in the infectious window period (IWP) or the assay(s)
produced a false-negative result. HIV lookback investigations undertaken by NHS
Blood and Transplant and the Welsh Blood Service between October 1995 and
December 2008 are described.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Investigations were undertaken into the previous
negative donations of 113 HIV-infected donors, including retrospective testing of
archive samples, tracing of components, and identification of recipients who were
offered HIV testing when appropriate. Data were collated on HIV seroconverters
and outcome of the lookback was summarized.
RESULTS: Two previous negative donations given before the introduction of
minipool nucleic acid testing (MP-NAT) screening were confirmed positive by
individual retrospective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the archive
specimen. Red blood cell components had been transfused from both donations. One 
recipient died after transfusion, and the other was alive and tested HIV
positive. All 23 (20%) donations previously testing negative by MP-NAT were
confirmed to be PCR negative on individual testing of an archive specimen and
none of the tested recipients of these donations had evidence of
transfusion-transmitted HIV.
CONCLUSION: The yield of lookback was low with one positive recipient identified 
over 13 years of surveillance: HIV transmission occurred from a window period
donation given before the introduction of MP-NAT screening and would have been
detected using current testing methods. Current residual risk estimates for the
United Kingdom predict that HIV lookback will be of limited benefit, as
demonstrated by our data.
