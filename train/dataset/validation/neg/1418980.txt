Tandemly polymerized regulatory elements, antisense RNA segments or ribozymes are
potentially useful in selective gene silencing. However, existing methods of
tandemly polymerizing short DNA segments are laborious. We present a procedure
that can create cloned arrays of 40-70 monomer units in two steps. We have
created long arrays of regulatory elements and potential ribozyme sequences.
Silencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) activation by tandem arrays of 
a regulatory element in human immune system cells and in other human and monkey
cells is discussed.
