Several studies of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type
1 have suggested that women have lower plasma HIV-1 RNA levels than men, even
when controlling for CD4 T cell levels. A cross-sectional analysis was performed 
in 494 patients (21% of whom were women) who enrolled in a prospective study of
anemic HIV-1-infected patients requiring transfusion. The median CD4 T cell count
and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were 15 cells/microL and 4.83 log(10) copies/mL
(67,350 copies/mL), respectively. In unadjusted analyses, women had slightly
higher mean log HIV-1 RNA titers than men (0.19 log(10) higher copies/mL; 95%
confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.44; P=.11). Adjustment for CD4 T cell count, race
or ethnicity, injection drug use, and age yielded a smaller sex difference (0.13 
log(10) copies/mL higher in women; P=.28). In this population of patients with
very advanced HIV disease, there is no evidence that women have lower HIV-1 RNA
levels than men.
