A newly developed colorimetric method, DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA), was applied
to the detection of neuraminidase subtypes N1 and N2 of influenza A viruses.
Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction with universal primers were
used for genomic amplification of H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 strains. Following
amplification, an aliquot of the PCR product was hybridized to biotinylated DNA
sequences (N1/N2 probes) immobilized on microtiter wells. The hybridization event
was revealed by monoclonal antibodies to double stranded DNA in a standard ELISA 
reaction. The assay described here was able to distinguish accurately between the
two neuraminidase subtypes of human influenza A viruses. It is a simple and rapid
method facilitating the handling of a large number of samples and therefore seems
to be easily applicable to diagnostic laboratories.
