Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of complementary DNA is
now a standard method for studies of gene expression. However, qPCR can identify 
genuine variation only when transcript quantities are accurately normalized to an
appropriate reference. To identify the most reliable reference genes for
transcript quantification by qPCR, we describe a systematic evaluation of
candidate reference genes of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0).
Twelve genes were selected for transcript stability studies by qPCR of
complementary DNA prepared from Arabidopsis leaf tissue infected with one of five
plant viruses (Cauliflower mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus, Tomato spotted
wilt virus, Turnip mosaic virus, and Turnip yellow mosaic virus). The F-box
family protein, elongation factor 1-Î±, sand family protein, and protodermal
factor 2 gene transcripts showed the most stable accumulation, whereas a
traditionally used reference gene, Actin8, showed the least stable accumulation
as measured by the geNorm algorithm. The data furnish plant virologists with
reference genes for normalization of qPCR-derived gene expression in
virus-infected Arabidopsis and will be beneficial to the selection and design of 
primers targeting orthologous genes in other plant species.
