BACKGROUND: JC virus (JCV), a polyoma virus, is the etiological agent of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunosuppressed patients. JCV T-Ag
has proven oncogenic potential and is expressed in colonic polyps and carcinomas.
We proposed that the prevalence of JCV T-Ag DNA is higher in the normal
gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa of immunosuppressed patients compared with their
immunocompetent counterparts.
AIMS: To look for JCV T-Ag DNA in the normal gastrointestinal mucosa of
immunosuppressed patients compared with immunocompetent controls.
METHODS: Macroscopically normal samples of upper and lower GI mucosa were
obtained from 38 immunosuppressed patients. A control group included samples from
19 immunocompetent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 29 non-IBD cases. DNA was
extracted and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using primers
specific for T-Ag.
RESULTS: JCV T-Ag DNA was found in nine of the immunosuppressed patients (23.7%) 
and in three of the controls (6.3%; P = 0.02). Transplant recipients had a
particularly high prevalence of JCV T-Ag DNA (35.3%). Patients with IBD receiving
immunosuppressive drugs had a higher prevalence of JCV T-Ag DNA in comparison
with IBD patients who did not receive immunosuppression (22.2% versus 10.5%,
respectively), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.574).
CONCLUSION: JCV T-Ag DNA is more prevalent in the upper and lower GI mucosa of
immunosuppressed patients, possibly indicating that the virus resides in these
patients. This may account for the higher prevalence of GI carcinomas in
immunosuppressed patients.
