Polyoma virus complementary RNA directs the in vitro synthesis of capsid proteins
VP1 and VP2.

Polyoma virus complementary RNA, synthesized in vitro by using highly purified
Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and nondefective form I polyoma DNA, was
translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. Polypeptides were synthesized that
comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the polyoma capsid 
proteins VP1 and VP2, although most of the cell-free products were of smaller
molecular weights. The VP1-size protein specifically immunoprecipitated with
anti-polyoma virus serum, and upon digestion by trypsin yielded
[35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides that co-chromatographed with the
[3H]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides of virion-derived VP1 on both
cation-exchange and anion-exchange resins. The VP2-size in vitro product
contained all the virion VP2 methionine-labeled tryptic peptides, as shown by
cation- and anion-exchange chromatography and two-dimensional fingerprinting on
cellulose. We conclude that full-length polyoma VP1 and VP2 are synthesized in
response to complementary RNA and consequently that the viral capsid proteins
VP1, VP2, and VP3 are entirely virus coded.
