viruses, hiv, hepatitis a, poliovirus, coxsackievirus b3 and
foot-and-mouth disease virus, use variety mechanisms suppress human
immune system order evade clearance host. therefore, investigating
how changes viral genome nonlethal virus lead an
alteration disease, survivable immunosuppression death, would
provide valuable information viral pathogenesis. addition, propose
that gaining better insight viruses suppress antiviral immune
response could lead viral-based therapeutics combat specifc autoimmune
diseases multiple sclerosis type 1 diabetes.
