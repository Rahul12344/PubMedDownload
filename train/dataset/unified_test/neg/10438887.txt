a panel cd4(+) t-cell clones generated peripheral blood lymphocytes 
from patient nonprogressing infection human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) using herpesvirus saimiri described recently. large, 
all clones expressed activated t-cell phenotype (th class 1) grew
without stimulation interleukin-2-containing medium. none these
clones produced hiv-1, clones negative hiv-1 dna. these
clones infected primary laboratory (iiib) strains hiv-1 with
syncytium-inducing (si) phenotypes, dramatic variation virus production was
observed. two clones highly susceptible, clones relatively 
or completely resistant infection si viruses. hiv-resistant clones
expressed cxcr4 coreceptors able fuse efficiently si virus
env-expressing cells, indicating block virus entry present 
resistant clones. additionally, hiv-1 dna detectable infection the
resistant clones, suggesting hiv resistance occurred clones
after virus entry probably integration. demonstrate the
resistant clones secrete factor(s) inhibit si virus production from
other infected cells chronically infected producer cell line. finally,
we show resistant clones express increased amount ligands
(stromal-derived factor sdf-1) cxcr4 known hiv-inhibitory cytokines. 
until now, ligands hiv coreceptors natural substances that
had shown play antiviral roles real significance vivo. data
from study show differential expression another anti-hiv factor(s)
by selected cd4(+) cells may responsible protection cells
against si viruses. results also suggest novel mechanism inhibition of
si viruses acts stage virus entry.
