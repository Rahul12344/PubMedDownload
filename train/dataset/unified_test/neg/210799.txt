cycloleucine blocks 5'-terminal internal methylations avian sarcoma virus 
genome rna.

dimock k, stolzfus cm.

cycloleucine, competitive inhibitor atp: l-methionine s-adenosyltransferase 
in vitro, used reduce intracellular concentrations of
s-adenosylmethionine means inhibit virion rna methylation in
chicken embryo cells infected b77 avian sarcoma virus. under
conditions cycloleucine treatment, virus production measured by
incorporation radioactive precursors number infectious particles is
not significantly affected, internal m6a methylations avian sarcoma
virus genome rna inhibited greater 90%. predominant 5'-terminal
structure viral rna produced treated cells m7g(5')pppg (cap zero) rather
than m7g-(5')pppgm (cap 1). appears results internal m6a and
penultimate ribose methylations required avian sarcoma rna synthesis 
and function. furthermore, methylations apparently required for
transport genome rna virus assembly sites. insensitivity the
5'-terminal m7g methylation inhibition cycloleucine suggests the
affinity s-adenosylmethionine 7-methylguanosine methyltransferase is
significantly greater 2'-0-methyltransferases the
n6-methyltransferases.
