target cells infected avian erythroblastosis virus differentiate become
transformed.

samarut j, gazzolo l.

transformation vitro bone marrow cells avian erythroblastosis virus
(aev) gives rise rapidly growing cells erythroid nature. target cells of
neoplastic transformation aev recruited among early progenitors the
erythroid lineage, burst-forming units-erythroid (bfu-e). express a
brain-related antigen high level immature antigen low level. 
show aev-transformed cells express low levels brain antigen high 
levels immature antigen. response specific factors regulating the
erythroid differentiation indicates sensitive to
erythropoietin. furthermore, cells transformed temperature-sensitive mutant 
of aev differentiate hemoglobin-synthesizing cells 4 days being
shifted nonpermissive temperature. properties similar to
those late progenitors erythroid lineage, colony-forming
units-erythroid (cfu-e). results indicate aev-transformed cells
are blocked differentiation cfu-e stage.
