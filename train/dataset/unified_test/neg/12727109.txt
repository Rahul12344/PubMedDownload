we developed improved method packaging adeno-associated virus (aav)
vectors replication-defective adenovirus-aav (ad-aav) hybrid virus. the
aav vector encoding human acid alpha-glucosidase (hgaa) cloned e1,
polymerase/preterminal protein-deleted adenovirus, packaged an
ad vector. importantly, ad-aav hybrid cannot replicate aav vector
packaging 293 cells, deletion polymerase/preterminal protein.
the residual ad-aav aav vector stock reduced <1 infectious particle
per 10(10) aav vector particles. modifications resulted approximately
30-fold increased packaging aav vector hybrid ad-aav vector method
as compared standard transfection-only methods. similarly improved packaging
was demonstrated pseudotyping aav vector aav6, aav vector
packaging second ad-aav vector encoding canine glucose-6-phosphatase.
liver-targeted delivery either ad-aav hybrid aav vector particles in
acid alpha-glucosidase-knockout (gaa-ko) mice revealed secretion hgaa the
ad-aav vector, sustained secretion hgaa aav vector in
hgaa-tolerant gaa-ko mice. development hybrid ad-aav vectors could
offer distinct advantages gene therapy glycogen storage diseases.
