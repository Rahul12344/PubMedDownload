a high correlation found activities protein disulphide
isomerase prolyl 4-hydroxylase assayed cells synthesizing various
collagen types type markedly different rates. highest
activities enzymes found freshly isolated chick-embryo tendon and
cartilage cells, intermediate activities confluent cultures human skin 
lung fibroblasts mouse 3t6 fibroblasts, lowest values three human 
sarcoma cell lines, difference protein disulphide isomerase activity
between freshly isolated tendon cells confluent
simian-virus-40-transformed human lung fibroblasts 25-fold. these
differences good agreement differences reported various
cells rates collagen synthesis. great similarity also found
between changes two enzyme activities measured per cell the
growth 3t6 fibroblast cultures early logarithmic phase the
stationary phase. correlation found protein disulphide isomerase
activity type collagen synthesized. data suggest protein
disulphide isomerase may involved formation intra-chain and
inter-chain disulphide bonds procollagens, collagen
type-related variation enzyme activity magnitude would explain 
the marked differences rates formation inter-chain disulphide bonds 
between various collagen types.
