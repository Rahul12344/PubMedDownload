developing vaccine human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) poses an
exceptional challenge. documented cases immune-mediated clearance
of hiv infected individual, known correlates immune protection.
although nonhuman primate models lentivirus infection provided valuable
data hiv pathogenesis, models predict hiv vaccine efficacy in
humans. combined lack predictive animal model undefined biomarkers
of immune protection hiv necessitate vaccines pathogen be
tested directly clinical trials. adaptive clinical trial designs can
accelerate vaccine development rapidly screening poor vaccines while
extending evaluation efficacious ones, improving characterization of
promising vaccine candidates identification correlates immune
