the effect tumor promoter, 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (tpa) on
enhancer dependent polyomavirus (py) dna replication examined cells
expressing py large antigen. results showed tpa enhanced py dna
replication stimulating activity element, one two cores of
py enhancer. three subdomains element, biding sites pebp1 
(pea1), member ap1 family, pebp5 able activate 
py dna replication. furthermore, binding site pebp1 pebp5 responded
to tpa enhance py dna replication. results suggest growth promoting
signals could activate dna replication directly via enhancer binding proteins.
