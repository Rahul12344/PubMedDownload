tolls toll-like receptors (tlrs) play important role host immune
defenses regulating expression antimicrobial peptides (amps) and
cytokines, functional differences crustacean tolls drosophila
tolls mammal tlrs largely unknown. novel toll receptor, named pctoll3,
was identified red swamp crayfish, procambarus clarkii. widely
expressed detected tissues, transcript hemocytes was
up-regulated 12 h vibrio parahemolyticus (vibrio) injection 24 h
post white spot syndrome virus (wssv) challenge. knockdown pctoll3, 
activity bacterial clearance inhibited, expression levels amps 
including crustin1 (cru1), anti-lippopolysaccharide factor 1 (alf1), and
lysozymes1 (lys1), could up-regulated vibrio, affected.
meanwhile, pctoll3 silencing influenced expression myeloid differentiation
factor 88 (pcmyd88), tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (pctraf6), and
pcdorsal, counterparts drosophila toll signaling pathway.
interestingly, pctoll3 silencing inhibited translocation pcdorsal from
cytoplasm nucleus. furthermore, knockdown pcdorsal also impaired the
expression amps vibrio challenge. hence, concluded that, besides
participating antiviral immunity, pctoll3 might also regulate expression
of cru1 lys1 participate anti-vibrio immune responses promoting
pcdorsal translocation nucleus.
