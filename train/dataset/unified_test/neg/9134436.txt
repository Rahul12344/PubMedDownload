homonojirimycin (hnj) n-methylhomonojirimycin (mhnj) tested as
inhibitors purified glycoprotein processing enzymes, glucosidase and
glucosidase ii. mhnj reasonably good inhibitor glucosidase (ki = 1 x
10(-6) m) three times effective enzyme hnj. on
the hand, hnj inhibited glucosidase ii ki 1 x 10(-6) m,
whereas mhnj three times less effective (ki = 3 x 10(-5) m). however, the
butyl derivative hnj low activity toward two processing
glucosidases. hnj methyl derivative also tested vivo using
influenza virus-infected mdck cells, measuring inhibition n-linked
oligosaccharide processing viral envelope glycoproteins. 100
micrograms/ml mhnj medium, essentially n-linked
oligosaccharide chains virus "high-mannose" type the
major structure characterized glc3man9(glcnac)2. similar results were
obtained hnj although compound less effective vivo well in
vitro. results keeping inhibitors effective 
glucosidase step. inhibitors also tested mdck cell cultures to
determine whether affected vivo synthesis proteins, of
lipid-linked saccharides. contrast deoxynojirimycin, been
reported inhibit formation lipid-linked saccharides, effects were
seen either incorporation mannose lipid-linked saccharides 
incorporation leucine protein.
