cytotoxic effect prostaglandins e2 f2alpha cells grown vitro the
influence compounds multiplication myxovirus parainfluenza 3 
investigated. prostaglandins added culture medium (0-01-10 mug/ml) 24
hr virus infection, 2 48 hr inoculation viruses.
wish cells monkey kidney cell cultures used. direct cytotoxic effect 
of prostaglandins concentrations 0-01-1 mug/ml found (viability,
supravital staining, phase-contrast system, nitro-bt reduction succinic
dehydrogenase tests), whereas concentration 10 mug/ml within 48 hr led 
reduction succinic dehydrogenase tests), whereas concentration 10
mug/ml within 48 hr led partial injury cell population symptoms of
damage mitochondria. prostaglandins e2 f2alpha inhibited multiplication of
parainfluenza 3 virus concentrations 0-1-10 mug/ml. inhibitory effect 
most pronounced prostaglandins added medium whole period of
virus multiplication i.e. 48 hr little effect found they
were added prior inoculation 2 hr it. inhibitory effect of
prostaglandins replication phase viruses suggested.
