newly recognized rat parvovirus (rat orphan parvovirus: ropv) examined for
viral excretion persistence infected rats, also infectivity to
mice hamsters. virus appeared replicate mainly lymphoid or
hematopoietic tissues, detected feces, urine oropharynx the
infected rats 1 4 weeks postinfection. infective virus also
detected peripheral leukocytes various tissues acute phase of
infection, decreased every tissue 8 weeks postinfection. viral dna,
however, persistent lymphoid tissues least 24 weeks
postinfection. virus inoculated mice hamsters, evidence of
viral production antibody response demonstrated. ropv assumed 
variant known rat parvovirus resulted alter cell tropism and
persist lymphoid hematopoietic tissues, order escape host immune
system.
