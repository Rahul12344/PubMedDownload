dsba, disulfide bond catalyst escherichia coli, periplasmic protein
having thioredoxin-like cys-30-xaa-xaa-cys-33 motif. cys-30-cys-33
disulfide donated pair cysteines target proteins. although
dsba, high oxidizing potential, prone reduction, maintained
essentially oxidized vivo. dsbb, integral membrane protein two
pairs essential cysteines, reoxidizes dsba reduced upon
functioning. known, however, might provide overall oxidizing
power dsba-dsbb disulfide bond formation system. report e.
coli mutants defective hema gene ubia-mena genes markedly
accumulate reduced form dsba growth conditions of
protoheme deprivation well ubiquinone/menaquinone deprivation. disulfide
bond formation beta-lactamase impaired conditions.
intracellular state dsbb found affected deprivation quinones, 
such accumulates first reduced form form a
disulfide-linked complex dsba. followed reduction bulk 
dsba molecules. results suggest respiratory electron transfer
chain participates oxidation dsba, acting primarily dsbb. is
remarkable cellular catalyst protein folding connected the
respiratory chain.
