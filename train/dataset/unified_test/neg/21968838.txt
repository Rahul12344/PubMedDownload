in various documents view emerges contemporary biotechnosciences are
currently experiencing scientific revolution: massive increase pace, scale
and scope. significant part research endeavours involved this
scientific upheaval devoted understanding and, possible, ameliorating
humankind: genomes bodies brains. new developments in
contemporary technosciences, synthetic biology genomics and
"post-genomics" fields, tend blur distinctions prevention, therapy
and enhancement. important dimension development "biomimesis": i.e.
