a wealth evidence led conclusion virtually cases of
cervical cancer attributable persistent infection subset human
papillomavirus (hpv) types, especially hpv type 16 (hpv-16) hpv-18. hpv
types also cause proportion cancers, including vulvar, vaginal, anal, 
penile, oropharyngeal cancers. although cervical cancer screening, primarily 
with papanicolaou (pap) smear, reduced incidence cancer in
industrialized countries, cervical cancer remains second common cause of
death cancer women worldwide, developing world lacked the
resources widespread, high-quality screening. addition advances pap 
smear technology, identification hpv etiologic agent produced 2
recent advances may major impact approaches reduce the
incidence disease. first development preventive vaccine, 
the current versions appear prevent close 100% persistent
genital infection disease caused hpv-16 hpv-18; future
second-generation vaccines may able protect oncogenic infections by
a broader array hpv types. second incorporation hpv testing into
screening programs. women aged >30 years, hpv testing identify high-grade 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia earlier pap smears acceptable rates 
of specificity. results, together high sensitivity hpv testing,
suggest testing could permit increased intervals screening. an
inexpensive hpv test development, successful, may incorporated part
of economically viable 'screen-and-treat' approach developing world.
the manner vaccination screening programs integrated need
to considered carefully efficient reducing overall
incidence cervical cancer.
