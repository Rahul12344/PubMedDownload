to determine predominant genotype varicella-zoster virus (vzv) in
suburban shanghai municipal province, specimens collected lesions
of 95 outpatients clinically diagnosed varicella herpes zoster. these,
69 patients (72.6%) positive vzv dna. 69 isolates genotyped
as genotype j1/clade 2. based sequencing 447 bp sequence orf22, 
66 isolates identified genotype j/clade 2 strains three were
identified type m2/clade 4 strains. confirm classification these
three strains, determined presence 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps) found isolates 1270/1450 shared seven snps differed from
those clade 2, three snps unique clade 3 another three
were unique clade 4. isolate 1456 two markers clade 4 differed
from clade 2. phylogenetic tree showed isolates clustered primarily 
with clade 2 three m2/j1 strains clustered clades 2 4.
it likely isolates 1270/1450/1446 may represent new subclade either 
clade 2 4, recombinant events. addition, isolates wt
strains. also observed significant inter-strain variations.
