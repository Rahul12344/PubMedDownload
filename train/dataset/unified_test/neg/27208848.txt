mycoviruses beneficial plants debilitate pathogenic
fungi thereby reducing severity associated plant diseases. studies date
have focused primarily culturable fungi represent fraction natural
fungal populations. nonculturable fungi, however, harbor diverse
populations mycoviruses reduce plant disease enhance resistance to
abiotic stress. metatranscriptome analysis field-grown plant samples using
high-throughput sequencing offers possibility unbiased detection and
quantification mycoviruses regardless culturability fungal
hosts together complete associated microbial consortia. study,
we describe fungal viromes phyllosphere production soybean fields
in illinois, usa analyzing metatranscriptomes thousands soybean leaf
samples collected 2008 2009 growing seasons. analyses
identified 25 partial genome sequences represented least 22 mycovirus
genomes, one described previously. novel mycovirus
genomes showed similarity 10 distinct lineages including genera
alphapartitivirus, botybirnavirus, endornavirus, mitovirus, mycoflexivirus,
ourmiavirus, totivirus, victorivirus, family tombusviridae, order
mononegavirales, recently proposed genus gemycircularvirus. present
study adds wealth mycoviruses associated plant phytobiomes and
establishes groundwork needed characterization viruses.
