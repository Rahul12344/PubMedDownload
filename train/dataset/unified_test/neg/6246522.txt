teratocarcinoma (tcc) stem cells provide unique prospects introduction of
specific genes mice, virtue dual capacity propagation in
vitro normal differentiation embryos. study, have
demonstrated foreign genes amenable selection culture be
transferred stem cells expressed. cells maintain expression of
the gene long periods differentiation tumors vivo absence
of selective pressure. cells also integrate unlinked nonselectable gene at
high frequency. addition cloned herpes simplex virus (hsv) thymidine
kinase (tk; atp:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, ec 2.7.1.21) gene cultures of
tk(-)tcc cells yielded tk(+) colonies frequency one colony per 4 mug of
plasmid dna. transformation efficiency, although appreciably lower 
mouse l tk(-) cells, permits isolation many transformants. hsv
provenance transformed phenotype verified characteristic
electrophoretic mobility tk protein neutralization tk
activity specific antiserum. moreover, blot hybridization tests revealed 
least one intact copy viral tk gene integrated dna transformed
cells. injected syngeneic mice, cells formed solid tumors with
various differentiating tissues. blot hybridization comparisons their
cell lines origin, seven nine tumors examined maintained hsv tk
gene without significant loss rearrangement. viral tk enzyme activity could
also demonstrated least tumors. cotransfer cloned
human beta-globin gene along unlinked hsv tk gene successful 2 of
10 tk(+) transformants. thus, defined genes stably introduced tcc
cells culture maintained vivo form transcribed
and translated produce functional protein.
