a genetic system elaborated study intramolecular recombination of
bacteriophages lambda phi 80. practically, ideal complementation of
nucleotide sequences recombining dna molecules required obtain
recombinants resulting reca-dependent recombination escherichia coli
cells. hypothesis proposed correction mismatched bases
hinders recombinant formation recombination fully homologous dnas. 
increased yields hybrid molecules interaction dna the
cells deficient genes correction support hypothesis well as
independent demonstration mutation gene correction according the
effect increased yield recombinants. series escherichia coli cells
mutants increased formation recombinant clones obtained.
