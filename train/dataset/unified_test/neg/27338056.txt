objective: hepatitis virus (hav) still continues serious public health 
problem worldwide. mean platelet volume (mpv) marker platelet function
and activation. study aimed evaluate relationship mpv in
acute hepatitis patients compared control group assess mpv 
an acute phase reactant acute hepatitis a.
patients methods: seventy-six patients enrolled study. the
control group consisted 41 healthy age- sex-matched individuals. alanine
aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), bilirubin, prothrombin 
time (pt), platelet count (pc), serum albumin (alb), mean platelet volume
(mpv) levels recorded. diagnosis hav infection based anti-hav 
ig positivity.
results: mean levels mpv study group significantly
statistically lower control group (p < 0.001). mpv levels
revealed correlation alt, ast, alp, ggt levels (p > 0.05), but
the mpv levels correlated platelet counts (p < 0.05). 9.75 fl [area
under curve (auc: 0.756)] optimal cutoff level mpv sensitivity of
69.7% specificity 68.3% determined children acute
hepatitis a.
conclusions: mpv levels significantly lower patients acute
hepatitis compared healthy control group. study demonstrated
that mpv may negative acute phase reactant acute hepatitis a. further
studies explain role mpv plays inflammation viral
infections.
