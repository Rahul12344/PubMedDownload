studying dispersal small flying insects culicoides constitutes a
great challenge due huge population sizes lack method efficiently 
mark objectively detect many specimens time. describe novel
mark-release-recapture method culicoides field using fluorescein
isothiocyanate (fitc) marking agent without anaesthesia. using plate
scanner, detection technique used analyse thousands individual 
culicoides specimens per day reasonable cost. marked released an
estimated 853 specimens pulicaris group 607 specimens obsoletus
group cattle farm denmark. estimated 9,090 (8,918-9,260) obsoletus
group specimens 14,272 (14,194-14,448) pulicaris group specimens were
captured surroundings subsequently analysed. two (0.3%) obsoletus
group specimens 28 (4.6%) pulicaris group specimens recaptured. two 
recaptured obsoletus group specimens caught release point the
night following release. eight (29%) recaptured pulicaris group specimens 
were caught pig farm 1,750 upwind release point. five these
were recaptured night following release three were
recaptured second night release. first time that

quantified. findings suggest extensive rapid exchange disease
