a systematic review longitudinal studies suggests intimate partner
violence (ipv) associated reduced contraceptive use, included
studies limited two time points. used seven waves data the
rakai community cohort study rakai, uganda estimate effect prior
year ipv one visit women's current contraceptive use following
visit. used inverse probability treatment-weighted marginal structural
models (msms) estimate relative risk current contraceptive use
comparing women exposed emotional, physical, and/or sexual ipv during
the year prior interview not. accounted time-fixed
and time-varying confounders prior ipv adjusted standard errors for
repeated measures within individuals. analysis included 7923 women
interviewed 2001 2013. weighted msms, women experienced
any form prior year ipv 20% less likely use condoms last sex than
women (95% ci: 0.12, 0.26). find evidence ipv affects
current use modern contraception (rr: 0.99; 95% ci: 0.95, 1.03); however,
current use partner-dependent method 27% lower among women reported 
any form prior-year ipv compared women (95% ci: 0.20, 0.33).
women experienced prior-year ipv less likely use condoms other
forms contraception required negotiation male partners and
more likely use contraception could hide male partners.

ipv higher rate hiv women not. finding women who
experience ipv less likely use condoms may help explain relation
between ipv hiv.
