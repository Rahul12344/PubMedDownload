more 90% adults latently infected epstein-barr virus (ebv), 
causative agent infectious mononucleosis, self-limiting lymphoproliferative 
disease characterized extensive cell activation. reactivation this
herpesvirus immunosuppression often associated oncogenesis. 
considerations led us analyze early events occur exposure of
the immune system ebv. strong major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class
ii-dependent mhc-restricted, cell proliferation observed vitro
in response autologous, lytically infected ebv-transformed b cells. by
measuring appearance early activation marker cd69 individual cell
v beta subsets, could demonstrate selective activation human v beta 13- t
cells. confirmed murine cell hybridomas expressing various human 
bv genes. ebv- burkitt's lymphoma cells nonstimulatory, induced v
beta-restricted cell activation ebv infection. ebv specific activation
was also demonstrated cord blood cells, excluding recall-antigen response.
thus, characteristics superantigen-stimulated response seen,

for superantigen infection, latency, oncogenesis.
