the superstructure covalently closed circular dna (of bacteriophage pm 2)
was compared electron microscopy linear duplex dna (of
bacteriophage t7) ionic strength benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride
concentration varied. parallel studies sedimentation behavior of
these dnas studied analytical ultracentrifugation, technical
reasons without benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride. by
combining information two methods one conclude with
increasing ionic strength linear duplex t7 dna spontaneously forms a
structure similar superhelical structure closed circular pm 2
dna. superstructure destroyed premelting conditions the
presence excess ethidium bromide.
