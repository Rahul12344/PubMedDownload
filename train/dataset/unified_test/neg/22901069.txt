since 1980s, worldwide re-emergence vector-borne diseases
including malaria, dengue, yellow fever or, recently, chikungunya. these
viruses arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted arthropods like 
mosquitoes aedes genus. nature arboviruses complex since it
conjugates human, environmental, biological geographical factors. recent
researchs suggested, particular reunion island epidemic in
2006, transmission aedes albopictus (an aedes genus specie) 
facilitated genetic mutations virus vector capacity adapt to
non tropical regions. paper formulate optimal control problem,
based biological observations. three main efforts considered order to
limit virus transmission. indeed, vaccine specific treatment 
against chikungunya, main measures limit impact such
epidemic considered. therefore, look time dependent breeding
sites destruction, prevention treatment efforts, optimal control
theory applied. using analytical numerical techniques, shown that
there exist cost effective control efforts.
