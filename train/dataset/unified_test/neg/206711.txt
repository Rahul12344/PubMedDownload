the vaccines used study derived purified murine mammary tumor
virus (mumtv) preparations. approximately 60% protein fractions consisted 
of major viral membrane glycoprotein gp52. inoculation sc 10 microgram
mumtv-s-derived vaccine significantly delayed appearance primary mammary
tumors gr balb/cfc3h mice (strains high incidences mammary
cancer); balb/c c3hf mice, moderate tumor incidence an
advanced age, treatment resulted slight substantial acceleration,
respectively, primary tumor development. induced cellular immune
reactivity vaccination, measured vivo winn test in
vitro leukocyte adherence inhibition assay, strongest gr strain as
compared balb/c strain. titer antibodies tumor cells, as
estimated membrane immunofluorescence, also higher gr strain. in
balb/cfc3h mice, influence different vaccination schemes an
mumtv-o-derived protein vaccine primary tumor development studied. 
sc injection, vaccine precipitated alum. dose 10 microgram
vaccine resulted 61% decrease tumor incidence. two five additional
booster injections 1 microgram protein vaccine beneficial effect,
although amount antibody measured increased boosting.
