retroviruses, form mobile genetic elements, important roles disease 
and primate evolution. exogenous retroviruses, human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv), significant pathological implications created a
massive public health challenge recent years. endogenous retroviruses (ervs), 
which primary focus review, also pathogenic, well as
being beneficial host cases. furthermore, retroviruses may have
played key role primate evolution resulted incorporation of
these elements human genome. retroviruses mobile genetic elements
that important roles disease primate evolution. further
discuss pathogenic potential retroviruses, including role cancer 
biology, briefly summarize evolutionary implications.
