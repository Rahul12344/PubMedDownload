two human herpesviruses, hhv-6 hhv-7, recently identified closely
related, studied influence cellular apoptosis and
proliferation. infection monitored viral dna--and antigen expression.
apoptosis cell proliferation determined immunocytological techniques 
and markers p53, p21waf/cip, bax, bak, bcl-2, cyclin d1 pcna, also
screened signal transduction indicators c-h-ras, c-fos raf-1.
cell differentiation function monitored determining cell membrane
receptors including fas cd specificities, elisa tests interleukin 
production. hhv-6 hhv-7 readily infected target cells, yet virus
antigen expression virus replication less active hhv-7 infection.
both viruses also induced gm-cfs production. cell differentiation terms cd 
receptor expression pronounced hhv-6 hhv-7 infection. no
differences found activity signal transduction factors. were
quantitative differences activation p53, bax, p21waf bcl-2 hhv
6-infected cbc compared hhv-7 infection supporting apoptosis cycle.
cyclind1 activity remained lower levels hhv-7 infected cbc, yet high in
similarly infected transformed supt1 cells. contrast, hhv-6 supported rather
the p53/p21waf apoptosis pathway untransformed cbc transformed hsb1
cells. herpesviruses, hhv-6 hhv-7, thus possessed similar biological
activities cultures non-transformed susceptible cells, although with
certain quantitative differences. data reported may support 
notion hhv-7 less active inducing apoptosis thus favoring continued
cell proliferation. mechanism viruses interfere the
network control cell proliferation, differentiation apoptosis appear 
complicated shown therefore afford detailed study, including
a sensitive technology immunohistology.
