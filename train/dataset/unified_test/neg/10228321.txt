it reported increase serum ferritin levels and/or hepatic
iron content associated poor response interferon treatment in
patients chronic hepatitis c (ch-c).aim: determinate whether iron
depletion phlebotomy (pb) increases response interferon therapy in
chronic hepatitis c.
patients methods: evaluated 12 patients ch-c (genotype 1b = 11, 
1a = 1), increased alt levels, positive serum vhc-rna increased serum
ferritin levels (> 220 ng/ml), including 8 previously non responders to
interferon therapy 4 naive subjects. phlebotomies performed weekly (mean
number per patient: 6, range: 5-12) serum ferritin levels < 100 ng/ml,
followed interferon treatment (3mu thrice weekly 3-12 months depending 
the response).
results: multiple regression analysis showed serum ferritin levels 
related serum alt levels (p = 0.18) viral load (p = 0.06). serum alt levels
decreased significantly post-pb (58 u/l, range: 35-141 u/l) compared to
pretreatment levels (164 u/l, range: 51-216 u/l, p < 0.006) normalized two
subjects. hcv-rna positive one latter negative other.
eleven twelve patients respond interferon three months of
therapy (increased serum alt levels 10 subjects positive hcv rna 11).
one additional patient, treated previously interferon and
had low pretreatment viral load, sustained response 12 months of
interferon therapy. viral load decreased either pb following
interferon treatment. contrast, serum ferritin levels increase with
interferon treatment 6 month follow-up period.
conclusions: decreasing serum ferritin levels phlebotomies increase
hcv erradication rate interferon treatment. sustained response to
interferon therapy infrequent event dependent viral factors 
(viral load genotype).
