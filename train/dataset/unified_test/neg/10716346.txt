as tools examine template switches recombination events process
of reverse transcription, two nearly identical moloney murine leukemia
virus-based (momlv) retroviral vectors constructed using technique of
recombinatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr). experimental vectors designed 
for study based well-characterized ln series vectors. the
protein coding regions normally present retroviral genome been
replaced coding regions two drug resistance markers, neomycin
phosphotransferase (neo) hygromycin phosphotransferase (hyg). one
functional drug resistance gene vector, individual vectors well as
recombination events followed phenotypic selection.
utilization recombinatory pcr allowed insertion subtle nucleotide 
changes resulting series restriction site polymorphisms two
retroviral vectors. ability create subtle mutations specific
locations retroviral vectors allowed utilization naturally
occurring areas variability vectors avoid regions important for
replication.
