cognitive dysfunction memory loss common features alzheimer's disease 
(ad). abnormalities expression profile immediate early genes play 
a critical role memory formation, camp-response element binding
protein (creb), reported brains ad patients. show
that amyloid-β (aβ) accumulation, plays primary role cognitive
deficits ad, interferes creb activity. show restoring
creb function via brain viral delivery creb-binding protein (cbp) improves
learning memory deficits animal model ad. notably, improvements
occur without changes aβ tau pathology, instead linked an
increased level brain-derived neurotrophic factor. resulting data suggest 
that aβ-induced learning memory deficits mediated alterations creb 
function, based finding restoring creb activity directly
modulating cbp levels brains adult mice sufficient ameliorate
learning memory. therefore, increasing cbp expression adult brains may 
a valid therapeutic approach ad, also various brain
disorders characterized alterations immediate early genes, further
supporting concept viral vector delivery may viable therapeutic
approach neurodegenerative diseases.
