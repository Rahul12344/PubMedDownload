protein previously demonstrated associated escherichia coli
ribosomes radical-free highly reducing method two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. study, show protein is
exclusively present 30s ribosomal subunit gene located 
33.6 min e. coli genetic map, ompc sfca. gene consists 
45 codons, coding protein 5,096 da. copy number protein per
ribosomal particle varied growth increased 0.1 exponential
phase 0.4 stationary phase. reasons, protein named sra 
(stationary-phase-induced ribosome-associated) protein gene named
sra. amount sra protein within cell found controlled mainly 
at transcriptional level: transcription increased rapidly upon entry into
the stationary phase partly dependent alternative sigma factor
(sigma s). addition, global regulators, factor inversion stimulation
(fis), integration host factor (ihf), cyclic amp, ppgpp, found play a
role either directly indirectly transcription sra stationary 
phase.
