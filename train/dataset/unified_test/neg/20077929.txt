in order study genotypes molecular evolution human enterovirus
(hev) species shandong province, stool samples collected afp and
hfmd patients shandong province virus isolation performed. reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reactions (rt-pcr) specific ev71 cva16
were performed virus isolates hfmd patients. positive isolates were
selected entire vp1 coding gene amplification sequencing. isolates with
negative pcr results isolates afp patients selected entire vp1 
coding gene amplification sequencing using primers specific hev a
species. phylogenetic tree constructed among vp1 nucleotide sequences
and strains. altogether 293 strains classified 8 genotypes were
isolated. homologous comparison phylogenetic analysis showed shandong
strains distinct prototype strains every genotype. report
presents overview hev-a shandong province.
