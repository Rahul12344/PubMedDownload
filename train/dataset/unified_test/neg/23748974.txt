molecular analysis parapoxvirus envelope genes performed. parapoxvirus dna
was detected eight calves eight farms iwate prefecture, japan, between
april september 2010. seven detected viruses identified bovine
papular stomatitis virus (bpsv) sequencing, nucleotide identity 
was 96.8% similar compared bpsv strain v660. among them, two
formed subgroup, amplicons digested xmn (a marker for
bpsv) hinc ii exhibited t61c nucleotide substitution sequenced
region. remaining virus pseudocowpox virus reported
previously japan. results demonstrate presence new bpsv variant
in japan genetic variability envelope gene.
