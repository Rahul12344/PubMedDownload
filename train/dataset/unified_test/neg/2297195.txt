four patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection received
chronic oral acyclovir therapy suppression recurrent varicella zoster or
herpes simplex virus infection developed persistent disseminated hyperkeratotic
papules failed heal intravenous high-dose oral acyclovir therapy.
varicella zoster virus, resistant acyclovir vitro, isolated skin
lesions four patients. three patients adults acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) diagnosed 12 20 months before
isolation acyclovir-resistant varicella zoster virus. fourth patient a
perinatally hiv-infected child developed primary varicella infection age 7
years profoundly immunosuppressed (absolute cd4+ lymphocyte count less 
50 cells/microl). mean antiviral susceptibilities (ed50 values) four
clinical isolates compared ed50 values reference strain oka 
85 compared 3.3 mumol/l acyclovir, 1.4 compared 0.8 mumol/l for
vidarabine, 123 compared 117 mumol/l foscarnet. assayed by
[125i]-dc plaque autoradiography, 90% 100% viral isolate populations
had altered measurable thymidine kinase function. acyclovir-resistant
varicella zoster virus infection may complicate long-term oral acyclovir
administration patients aids may associated appearance of
atypical hyperkeratotic papules.
