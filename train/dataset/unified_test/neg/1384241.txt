the immunogenic properties lassa virus gp1, gp2, np polypeptides were
studied rabbits. lassa virus np polypeptide, contrast gp1 gp2
polypeptides, shown induce highest titres antibodies determined 
ifa elisa tests. moreover, antibody relative avidity experiment showed
that anti-np antibodies elisa index 0.63 whereas anti-gp1 anti-gp2
antisera 0.49 0.28, respectively.
