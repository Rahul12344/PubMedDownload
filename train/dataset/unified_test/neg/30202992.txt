objective: objective study assess epidemiological clinical
features human bocavirus (hbov) coinfection viruses.
method: children coinfected hbov january 2012 december 2014 were
enrolled retrospectively reviewed.
result: total 984 patients stratified five groups: hbov infection 
alone (n = 249), respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection alone (n = 649),
hbov coinfection rsv (n = 28), human rhinovirus (hrv) (n = 39) with
other virus (n = 19). length hospitalization longer hbov coinfection
with rsv group hbov (9.0 days vs. 7.0 days, p = 0.001), rsv (9.0 days vs.
8.0 days, p = 0.016) infection alone group. pneumonia common hbov
coinfection rsv group compared hbov, rsv infection alone group,
respectively (75.0% vs. 44.2%, 31.3%, p < 0.001). hbov dna copy numbers (383 000 
copies/ml) positively correlated length hospitalization
(r = 0.334, p < 0.001).
conclusion: hbov coinfection rsv increases hbov infection severity.
