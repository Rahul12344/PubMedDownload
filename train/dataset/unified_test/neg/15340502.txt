background: study characteristics peripheral cell subsets 94 children 
with chronic hepatitis b elucidate relationships clinical status 
and hepatic pathology.
methods: peripheral cell subsets detected using flow cytometric analysis
with specific monoclonal antibodies staining 94 patients hbv infection.
the authors simultaneously detected serum alt, markers hbv infection and
examined liver biopsy material pathological changes.
results: patients serious liver lesion, ratio cd4+/cd8+ cells 
significantly higher mild lesion (1.41+/-0.54 vs 1.08+/-0.35, p
less 0.05), seemed associated various liver lesions
among patients. female cases, levels cd4+ cells ratio 
cd4+/cd8+ cells higher counterpart male cases (33.1+/-5.39
vs 28.8+/-6.28, 1.28+/-0.32 vs 1.02+/-0.36, p less 0.05), level of
cd8+ cells lower males (26.79+/-4.66 vs 30.51+/-7.17, p less 
than 0.05). obvious correlation cell subsets and
circulating hbv viral load, size spleen among hbv-infected children.
conclusion: characteristics peripheral cell subsets probably suggests
the immune disorder occurred children hepatitis b compared with
healthy controls mechanism needs investigation.
