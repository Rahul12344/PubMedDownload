minimal food-processing methods effective foodborne viruses, such
as human norovirus (nv). important, therefore, explore novel nonthermal 
technologies decontamination foods eaten fresh, minimally processed and
ready-to-eat foods, food contact surfaces. studied vitro virucidal 
activity cold atmospheric gaseous plasma (cgp) feline calicivirus
(fcv), surrogate nv. factors affecting virucidal activity cgp (a
so-called radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet) plasma
generation power, exposure time distance, plasma feed gas mixture,
and virus suspension medium. exposure 2.5-w argon (ar) plasma caused a
5.55 log10 unit reduction fcv titer within 120 s. reduction the
virus titer increased increasing exposure time decreasing exposure
distance. four plasma gas mixtures studied (ar, ar plus 1% o2, ar plus 1% 
dry air, ar plus 0.27% water), ar plus 1% o2 plasma treatment highest
virucidal effect: 6.0 log10 units virus 15 exposure. 
the lowest virus reduction observed ar plus 0.27% water plasma treatment
(5 log10 unit reduction 120 s). highest reduction titer observed
when virus suspended distilled water. changes temperature ph
and formation h2o2 responsible virucidal effect plasma.
the oxidation viral capsid proteins plasma-produced reactive oxygen and
nitrogen species solution thought responsible virucidal 
effect. conclusion, cgp exhibits virucidal activity vitro the
potential combat viral contamination foods food preparation
