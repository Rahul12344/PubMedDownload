aims: investigate impact scaling-up opiate substitution therapy (ost)
and high coverage needle syringe programmes (100%nsp-obtaining sterile
syringes inject) hcv prevalence among injecting drug users (idus).
design: hepatitis c virus hcv transmission modelling using u.k. estimates for
effect ost 100%nsp individual risk hcv infection.
setting: range chronic hcv prevalent (20/40/60%) settings ost/100%nsp,
and u.k. setting 50% coverage ost 100%nsp.
participants: injecting drug users.
measurements: decrease hcv prevalence 5-20 years due scale-up ost 
and 100%nsp 20/40/60% coverage ost/100%nsp settings, 50% to
60/70/80% coverage u.k. setting.
findings: 40% chronic hcv prevalence, scaling-up ost 100%nsp 0% to
20% coverage reduces hcv prevalence 13% 10 years. increases a
24/33% relative reduction 40/60% coverage. marginally less impact occurs in
higher prevalence settings 10 years, becomes pronounced over
time. united kingdom, without current coverage levels ost 100%nsp
the chronic hcv prevalence could 65% instead 40%. however, increasing ost
and 100%nsp coverage unlikely reduce chronic prevalence less
than 30% 10 years unless coverage becomes ≥80%.
conclusions: scaling-up opiate substitution therapy high coverage needle 
syringe programmes reduce hepatitis c prevalence among injecting drug users, 
but reductions modest require long-term sustained intervention
coverage. high coverage settings, interventions needed further
decrease hepatitis c prevalence. low coverage settings, sustained scale-up 
both interventions needed.
