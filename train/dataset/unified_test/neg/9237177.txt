infantile capillary hemangiomas vascular neoplasms appear quite
infiltrative histologically characterized cords cells with
areas marked cellularity. lesions shown contain a
population rapidly proliferative endothelial cells. given recent
association presence human herpes virus 8 (hhv8) another
proliferative vascular lesion, kaposi's sarcoma, used polymerase chain
reaction technology examine series 16 biopsy specimens 15 infantile 
capillary hemangiomas presence hhv8 dna. unable detect hhv8
dna lesions studied. cases examined parallel
with case kaposi's sarcoma known positive hhv8 dna 
series negative controls. cases, amplification beta-globin
gene dna demonstrated adequate preservation dna tissue studied. these
findings suggest endothelial cell proliferations attributed
to hhv8 etiology conditions remains unclear.
