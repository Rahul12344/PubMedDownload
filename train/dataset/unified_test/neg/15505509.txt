ozone known act strong antimicrobial agent bacteria, fungi,
and viruses. present study, examined effect ozonated water
against enterococcus faecalis streptcoccus mutans infections vitro in
bovine dentin. irrigation ozonated water, viability e. faecalis
and s. mutans invading dentinal tubules significantly decreased. notably, when
the specimen irrigated sonication, ozonated water nearly same
antimicrobial activity 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). also compared 
cytotoxicity l-929 mouse fibroblasts ozonated water naocl.
the metabolic activity fibroblasts high cells treated with
ozonated water, whereas fibroblasts significantly decreased the
cells treated 2.5% naocl. results suggest ozonated water
application may useful endodontic therapy.
