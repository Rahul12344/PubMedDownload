objective: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 (cin2-3) usually
treated cone excision, although 30% progress cancer 6-50% regress 
spontaneously. biomarkers predicting cin2-3 regression would great clinical
value could reduce unnecessary cone excision associated complications.
the aim study investigate whether punch-biopsy derived
immunohistochemical biomarkers, local immune response, cin lesion size condom
use independently correlated regression cin2-3.
methods: prospective population-based cohort study 162 women aged 25-40,
with first-time onset diagnosis cin2-3 colposcopy-directed biopsies was
carried out. median biopsy-cone interval 16 weeks. regression defined
as cin1 less cone biopsy.
results: regression rate 21% (34/162). prb>30% lower epithelial
half strongest predictor regression (30% regression, p<0.0001). if
additionally cin-lesion smaller 2.5mm cd4+ lymphoid cells the
subepithelial stroma ≤ 195 per 1.04 mm basal membrane, regression rate was
53%. cin-lesions>2.5mm cd4+-stroma ≤195, consistent condom use increased
the regression rate 13% 67% (p=0.003). prb ≤30%, regression
rate low (6%).
conclusion: biomarkers cin lesion length predict cin2-3 regression, and
might helpful identify patients increase regression rate cin
lesions consistent condom use.
