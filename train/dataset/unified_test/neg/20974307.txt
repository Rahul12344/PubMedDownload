in study, immunity level southern greek population the
1-10-year, 11-20-year, 21-30-year 31-40-year age groups regard sabin 
vaccine strains collection 11 recombinant three non-recombinant
poliovirus vaccine strains determined. results showed lowest
neutralization titre 21-30-year-age group poliovirus type 3.
moreover, capsid coding region opv (oral poliovirus vaccine) derivatives
was sequenced order identify mutations might lead antigenic
changes. sabin-1 derivatives tendency accumulation mutations was
observed near antigenic sites sabin-2 sabin-3 derivatives in
sites known involved restoring neurovirulence eliminating their
temperature-sensitive phenotype. concluded combination of
mutations capsid coding region number specific mutations in
antigenic sites determines antigenic properties opv derivatives 
reactivity human sera.
