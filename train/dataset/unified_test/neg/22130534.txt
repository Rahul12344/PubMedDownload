kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection latency-associated
nuclear antigen (lana-1) upregulate multifunctional protein angiogenin (ang).
our studies demonstrate silencing ang inhibiting nuclear
translocation downregulates kshv lana-1 expression ang necessary kshv 
latency, anti-apoptosis angiogenesis (sadagopan et al., j. virol.
83:3342-3364, 2009; sadagopan et al., j virol. 85:2666-2685, 2011). show 
that lana-1 interacts ang colocalizes latently infected endothelial
telomerase-immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial (tive-ltc) cells. mass
spectrometric analyses tive-ltc proteins immunoprecipitated anti-lana-1 and
ang antibodies identified 28 common cellular proteins ribosomal proteins,
structural proteins, trna synthetases, metabolic pathway enzymes, chaperons,
transcription factors, antioxidants, ubiquitin proteosome proteins. lana-1
and ang interaction one proteins, annexin a2, validated. annexin 
a2 shown play roles cell proliferation, apoptosis, plasmin
generation, exocytosis, endocytosis, cytoskeleton reorganization. also 
known associate glycolytic enzyme 3-phosphoglyceratekinase primer 
recognition protein (prp) complex interacts dna polymerase α the
lagging strand dna replication. higher level annexin a2 is
expressed kshv+ epstein-barr virus (ebv)+ b-lymphoma cell lines.
annexin a2 colocalized several lana-1 punctate spots kshv+ body cavity
b-cell lymphoma (bcbl-1) cells. triple-staining analyses, observed annexin 
a2-ang-lana-1, annexin a2-ang, ang-lana-1 colocalizations. annexin a2
appeared punctate nuclear dots lana-1-positive tive-ltc cells. in
lana-1-negative tive-ltc cells, annexin a2 detected predominately the
cytoplasm, nuclear spots, colocalization ang observed
mostly cytoplasm. annexin a2 coimmunoprecipitated lana-1 ang in
tive-ltc bcbl-1 cells ang 293t cells independent lana-1.

separate complex ang. silencing annexin a2 bcbl-1 cells resulted in
significant cell death, downregulation cell cycle-associated cdk6 of
cyclin d, e, proteins, downregulation lana-1 ang expression.

ang association annexin a2, kshv probably uses annexin a2 maintain
the viability cell cycle regulation latently infected cells. since the
identified lana-1- ang-interacting common cellular proteins hitherto
unknown kshv ang biology, offers starting point further
analysis roles kshv biology, may lead identification of
potential therapeutic targets control kshv latency associated
