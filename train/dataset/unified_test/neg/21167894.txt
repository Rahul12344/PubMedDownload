infection japanese encephalitis virus (jev) causes neuroinfection and
neuroinflammation characterized profound neuronal destruction/dysfunction,
concomitant microgliosis/astrogliosis, production various molecules that
initiate recruitment immune cells sites infection. previously,
we reported glial cells expressed rantes (regulated upon activation, normal 
t cell expressed secreted) chemotactic activity response jev
infection. study, demonstrated jev-infected microglia had
an additional activity regulating rantes production. astrocytes and
microglia responded jev infection releasing rantes process likely
related viral replication. independent infectious virus, supernatants of
jev-infected microglia, jev-infected astrocytes, caused additional rantes
production astrocytes. antibody neutralization studies suggested the
potential involvement tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α) interleukin-1
beta (il-1β) mediating additional rantes production. treatment astrocyte
cultures tnf-α il-1β caused activation several signaling molecules
and transcription factors crucial rantes gene expression, including reactive
oxygen species, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, nf-κb, nf-il6,
increased rantes gene promoter activity, provoked rantes production. 
rantes, neutralization bioactive tnf-α il-1β caused attenuation of
chemotactic activity supernatants mixed glia containing astrocytes and
microglia course jev infection. conclusion, tnf-α il-1β
produced jev-infected microglia might trigger another mechanism induces 
a secondary wave rantes gene expression activating astrocytes. released
rantes glial cells might play role recruitment immune cells
during jev infection.
