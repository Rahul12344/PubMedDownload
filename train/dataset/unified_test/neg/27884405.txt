zika virus (zikv) persists semen male patients, first flavivirus 
infection. here, demonstrate zikv induce inflammation testis
and epididymidis, prostate seminal vesicle, lead to
damaged testes 60 days post-infection mice. zikv induces innate immune
responses leydig, sertoli, epididymal epithelial cells, resulting the
production pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. however, zikv not
induce rapid abundant cytokine production peritubular cell and
spermatogonia, suggesting cells vulnerable zikv infection 
could potential repositories zikv. study demonstrates a
correlation zikv testis infection/damage suggests zikv
infection, certain circumstances, eventually lead male infertility.
