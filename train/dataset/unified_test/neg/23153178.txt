background: arthropod-borne viral infections cause several emerging resurging
infectious diseases. among diseases caused arboviruses, chikungunya is
responsible high level severe human disease worldwide. salivary
glands mosquitoes last barrier pathogen transmission.
methods: undertook proteomic approach characterize key virus/vector
interactions host protein modifications occur salivary glands
that could responsible viral transmission using quantitative
two-dimensional electrophoresis.
results: defined protein modulations salivary glands aedes
aegypti triggered 3 5 days oral infection (3 5 dpi)
with chikungunya virus (chikv). gel profile comparisons showed chikv 3
dpi modulated level 13 proteins, 5 dpi 20 proteins. amount of
10 putatively secreted proteins regulated time points. proteins
were implicated blood-feeding immunity, many known function.
chikv also modulated quantity proteins involved several metabolic
pathways cell signalling.
conclusion: study constitutes first analysis protein response of
aedes aegypti salivary glands infected chikv. found the
differentially regulated proteins response viral infection include
structural proteins enzymes several metabolic pathways. may favour
virus survival, replication transmission, suggesting subversion the
insect cell metabolism arboviruses. example, proteins involved in
blood-feeding short d7, adenosine deaminase inosine-uridine
preferring nucleoside hydrolase, may favour virus transmission exerting an
increased anti-inflammatory effect. would allow vector bite without
the bite detected. proteins, like anti-freeze protein, may
support vector protection.
