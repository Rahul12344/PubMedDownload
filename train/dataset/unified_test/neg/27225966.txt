increasing prevalence severity multi-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial
infections necessitated novel antibacterial strategies. ideally, new
approaches would target bacterial pathogens exerting selection reduced 
pathogenesis bacteria inevitably evolve resistance therapeutic
intervention. example management strategy, isolated lytic
bacteriophage, omko1, (family myoviridae) pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes
the outer membrane porin (oprm) multidrug efflux systems mexab mexxy
as receptor-binding site. results show phage selection produces an
evolutionary trade-off mdr p. aeruginosa, whereby evolution bacterial
resistance phage attack changes efflux pump mechanism, causing increased
sensitivity drugs several antibiotic classes. although modern phage
therapy still infancy, conclude phages, omko1,
represent new approach phage therapy bacteriophages exert selection
for mdr bacteria become increasingly sensitive traditional antibiotics.
this approach, using phages targeted antibacterials, could extend lifetime
of current antibiotics potentially reduce incidence antibiotic
resistant infections.
