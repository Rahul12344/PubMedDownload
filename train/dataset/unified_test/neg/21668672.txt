background: obesity identified independent risk factor severe 
or fatal infection 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza (2009 ph1n1), not
previously recognized previous pandemic seasonal influenza infections.
objectives: aim evaluate role obesity independent risk
factor severity infection 2009 ph1n1, seasonal h1n1, pathogenic 
h1n1 influenza virus.
methods: diet-induced obese (dio) non-obese, age-matched control
counterparts inoculated 2009 ph1n1, a/california/04/2009 (ca/09),
current seasonal h1n1, a/ny/312/2001 (ny312), highly pathogenic 1918-like
h1n1, a/iowa/swine/1931 (sw31), virus.
results: following inoculation ca/09, dio mice higher mortality (80%)
than control mice (0%) lost weight infection. effect of
obesity morbidity mortality observed ny312 sw31 infection.
influenza antigen distribution alveolar regions lungs more
pronounced dio control mice ca/09 infection 3 days
post-inoculation (dpi), despite similar virus titers. ca/09 infection,
localized interferon-Î² proinflammatory cytokine protein responses the
lungs significantly lower dio control mice. conversely, serum
cytokine concentrations elevated dio, control mice following
infection ca/09. effect obesity differential immune responses 
abrogated ny312 sw31 infection.
conclusions: together, data support epidemiologic reports obesity may 
be risk factor severe 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza infection, role 
of obesity seasonal highly virulent pandemic influenza infection remains
unclear.
