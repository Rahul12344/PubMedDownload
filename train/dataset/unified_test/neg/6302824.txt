in order study relationship anti-rana antibodies (arana) the
antibodies capable recognising epstein-barr induced antigens, we
examined sera 51 patients without rheumatoid arthritis anti-rana,
anti-ea, anti-vca, anti-ebna antibodies. subjects cases of
burkitt's lymphoma, infectious mononucleosis, naso-pharyngeal carcinoma, immune
disorders, hodgkin's disease normal controls. blind study conducted 
two separate laboratories. anti-rana detected indirect immunofluorescence 
on raji cells synchronised phase g1. strict correlation
between anti-rana anti-ebna correlation anti-rana anti-ea
or anti-vca. another experiment, 15 coded sera patients classical
rheumatoid arthritis tested following adsorption rheumatoid factor.
one serum found devoid anti-rana anti-ebna. results
demonstrate anti-rana widely distributed outside rheumatoid arthritis 
and question distinction ebna rana, antibody titres
directed antigens regularly linked together.
