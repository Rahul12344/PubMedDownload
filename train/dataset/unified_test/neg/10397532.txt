objectives: determine whether cd28-cd8+ cells develop hiv
infection contain hiv-specific cytotoxic precursor cells.
design: cd8 subpopulations six asymptomatic hiv-positive adults, with
varying degrees cd4 cell loss, sorted flow cytometry and
hiv-specific precursor cytotoxic lymphocyte frequencies measured. three
populations cd8 cells tested: cd28+cd5-- cells, cd28-cd57+ cells
(thought memory cells) cd28-cd57- cells (function unknown).
methods: sorted cd8 subsets stimulated antigen presenting cells
expressing hiv-1 gag/pol molecules. cytotoxic cell assays gag/pol expressing
51cr-labeled epstein-barr virus transformed autologous b cells lines control
targets performed 2 weeks. specific lysis precursor frequencies
were calculated.
results: cd28 positive cd28-cd57+ populations contained appreciable
numbers precursors (9-1720 per 10(6) cd8+ cells). however, cd28-cd57-
population fewer precursors five six people studied. cd28
positive hiv-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte precursors found patients
with cd4:cd8 ratios > 1, whereas cd28-cd57+ precursors found in
patients whose cd4:cd8 ratios < 1 (r2, 0.68).
conclusions: memory hiv-specific precursor cytotoxic lymphocytes found in
both cd28 positive cd28-cd8+ cells, however, cd28-cd57- subpopulation had
fewer. cd28-cd57+ cells antigen-driven limited diversity, the
loss cd28 cd8 cells disease progression may reduce response to
new hiv mutations; requires testing.
