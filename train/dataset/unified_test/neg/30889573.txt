objective: porcine endogenous retroviruses (perv) involved pig human
xenotransplantation raised great concerns ubiquitous nature
in pigs ability infecting human cells vitro. although no
significant cytopathic effect attributed perv evident perv-infected
human embryonic kidney 293 (hek293) cells, proteomic analysis to
investigate differences protein profile order characterize
the effect perv infection.
methods: hek293 cells cocultured porcine peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmcs). protein profiles perv-infected -noninfected hek293 cells
were analyzed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de). protein spots with
at least 1.5-fold alteration identified high-definition mass spectrometry
(hdms) analysis. real-time rt-pcr western blotting performed to
validate proteomic results.
results: differential analysis perv-infected -noninfected hek293 cells 
2-de revealed ten differentially regulated proteins. proteins identified by
hdms involved various cellular pathways including signal transduction,
cell apoptosis, protein synthesis.
conclusion: results study revealed differentially expressed proteins 
in hek293 cells cocultured porcine pbmcs implied changes were
probably induced perv infection. results provide clues potential
links understanding molecular effect infection human-tropic
perv.
