based nucleotide sequence homology rna-1 rna-2 nepoviruses
isolated grapevines, three sets degenerate primers, one the
three subgroups genus (a, b c), designed proved effective for
rt-pcr detection subgroups infected grapevines herbaceous hosts.
primers designed specifically detecting subgroup species amplified a
fragment 255 bp samples infected grapevine fanleaf virus (gflv),
arabis mosaic virus (armv), tobacco ringspot virus (trsv) grapevine
deformation virus (gdefv), samples infected nepovirus
species. similarly, primers detection subgroup b nepoviruses amplified a
390 bp product samples infected grapevine chrome mosaic virus (gcmv),
tomato black ring virus (tbrv), grapevine anatolian ringspot virus (garsv) and
artichoke italian latent virus (ailv). third set primers amplified 640
bp fragment, samples infected subgroup c nepoviruses, i.e tomato
ringspot virus (torsv) grapevine bulgarian latent virus (gblv), grapevine
tunisian ringspot virus (gtrsv). primers able detect simultaneously
all viral species belonging subgroup discriminate species of
different subgroups. multiplex-pcr detection subgroup b nepoviruses 
obtained using specific primer (sense subgroup antisense subgroup
b) species subgroup combination the
degenerate subgroup-specific primers. way possible detect four 
different viral species single samples containing mixtures viruses the
same subgroup. particular, viruses subgroup (trsv, gflv, armv and
gdefv) amplicons 190, 259, 301 371 bp obtained, whereas amplicons 
190, 278, 425 485 bp, respectively, obtained samples infected 
viruses subgroup b (gcmv, ailv, garsv tbrv).
