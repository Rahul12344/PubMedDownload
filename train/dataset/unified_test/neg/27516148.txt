coadministration pomegranate rind extract (pre) zinc (ii) ions has
recently reported potential new topical treatment herpes simplex
virus (hsv) infections. current work examined vitro topical
delivery punicalagin (major phytochemical pre) zinc hydrogels
across epithelial membranes become infected hsv. porcine epidermal,
buccal vaginal mucous membranes excised mounted franz diffusion
cells dosed simple hydrogel containing pre zinc sulphate (znso4). 
the permeation punicalagin zinc determined hplc icpms
respectively; punicalagin also determined basal layers reverse tape
stripping. receptor phases epidermal membrane experiment also used 
to challenge hsv-1 vero host cells, ex vivo porcine skin used probe
cox-2 modulation. punicalagin zinc permeated three test
membranes, significantly greater amounts delivered across the
epidermal membrane. amounts punicalagin permeating buccal vaginal 
membranes similar, although amount zinc permeating vaginal
membrane comparatively large - known zinc interacts with
vaginal mucosa. punicalagin recovered reverse tape stripping the
epidermal, buccal vaginal membranes gave 0.47±0.016, 0.45±0.052 and
0.51±0.048nmcm-2 respectively, statistically (p<0.05). 2.5
log reduction achieved hsv-1 using diffusion cell receptor phase, and
cox-2 expression reduced 64% ex vivo skin 6h. overall, hydrogel
containing 1.25mgml-1 pre 0.25m znso4 able topically deliver 
major bioactive compound within pre zn (ii) across membranes the
site specific region herpes simplex vesicular clusters, maintaining
potentiated virucidal anti-inflammatory properties. novel therapeutic
system therefore potential topical treatment hsv infections.
