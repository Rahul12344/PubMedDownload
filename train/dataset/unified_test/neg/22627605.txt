background: hiv-1 strains diversified extensively mutation and
recombination since initial transmission human beings many decades ago
in central africa first part 20th century (between 1915 1941). 
the upward trend global hiv-1 diversity continued unabated, newer
groups, subtypes, unique circulating recombinants increasingly being
reported, especially africa.
objective: review, focus extensive diversity hiv-1 a
decade (2000-2011), 51 countries three african geographic regions
(eastern southern, western central, northern africa) per the
who/unaids 2010 classification.
methodology: references review identified searches of
pubmed, conference abstracts, google scholar, springer online archives
collection. retrieved 273 citations, 200 reported hiv-1 diversity
from africa january, 2000 august, 2011. articles resulting these
searches relevant references cited articles reviewed. articles 
published english french included.
findings: high diversity hiv-1 epicenter, west-central
africa. subtypes, namely, (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5), c, crf02_ag, d
accounted 85% new infections. subtype stable in
east africa; c southern africa; a, g, crf02_ag, crf06_cpx western
africa; subtype b crf02_ag northern africa. recently new putative
group, designated p, reported found two cameroonians.
conclusion: regional distributions individual subtypes recombinants
are broadly stable, although unique/circulating recombinant forms may play an
increasing role hiv pandemic. understanding kinetics directions of
this continuing adaptation impact viral fitness, immunogenicity, and
pathogenicity crucial successful design effective hiv vaccines.
there need regular monitoring review updates, one
presented here, assist countries plan anticipate complex forms may
be introduced time.
