a new cell proliferation analysis flow cytometry applied mitogen
induced cultures peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) either normal,
healthy donors individuals infected human immunodeficiency
virus, type 1 (hiv-1). phytohemagglutinin (pha) stimulation normal pbmc 
(npbmc) yielded propagation cd4 (ncd4) cd8 (ncd8) cell subsets,
similar activation pbmc certain hiv-1-infected individuals (hiv-pbmc)
produced active proliferation cd8 (hiv-cd8) cells varying degrees cd4
(hiv-cd4) cell destruction. however, measurable viral p24 antigen produced
extracellularly. hand, purified hiv-cd4 cells were
similarly activated, cell death noted high titer p24 detected
in culture supernatants. addition exogenous il-2 either hiv-pbmc or
hiv-cd4 cultures, alter either cd4 cell death hiv-1 p24 production.
isolated hiv-cd8 killed hiv-cd4 also ncd4, co-cultured less
proliferative fractions cd4 cell population preferred targets 
the hiv-cd8 ctl activity. presence anti-cd4 ctl activity closely
associated high cd8, cd4 counts, hiv+ patients.
