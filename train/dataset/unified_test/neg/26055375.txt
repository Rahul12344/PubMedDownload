a total 302 clinical herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) strains, collected 4 
decades 1973 2014, characterized retrospectively drug
resistance. hsv-1 isolates analyzed genotypically nonsynonymous
mutations thymidine kinase (tk) dna polymerase (pol) genes. the
resistance phenotype acyclovir (acv) and/or foscarnet (fos) examined 
in case novel, unclear, resistance-related mutations. twenty-six novel 
natural polymorphisms could detected tk gene 69 dna pol
gene. furthermore, three novel resistance-associated mutations (two tk
gene one dna pol gene) analyzed, eight known hitherto
unclear amino acid substitutions (two encoded tk six dna pol gene) 
could clarified. 1973 2014, distribution amino acid changes
related natural gene polymorphisms tk dna pol remained largely
stable. resistance acv confirmed phenotypically 16 isolates, and
resistance acv plus fos confirmed 1 isolate. acyclovir-resistant
strains observed year 1995 onwards, predominantly in
immunosuppressed patients, especially stem cell transplantation, and
the number acv-resistant strains increased last 2 decades. data
confirm strong genetic variability among hiv-1 isolates, more
pronounced dna pol gene tk gene, facilitate
considerably rapid genotypic diagnosis hsv-1 resistance.
