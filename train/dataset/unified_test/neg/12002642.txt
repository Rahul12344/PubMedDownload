the aim study examine whether possible predict the
presence persistently infected (pi) animals bovine viral diarrhoea virus 
on dairy farms netherlands, based blood samples herd,
possibly combination bulk milk test antibodies. 25 herds with,
and 24 herds without, pi animal(s) probabilities obtaining least x
antibody positive animals sample n animals calculated, n
varying 3 7 values x considered n, n - 1 n - x.
this probability, among animals 9-24 months old, ranged 0.70 0.96 for
herds pi animals 0.13 0.37 herds without. using result
of bulk milk testing addition add prediction. concluded 
that, due high percentage large variation antibody positive animals
in herds without pi animals, possible predict presence pi
