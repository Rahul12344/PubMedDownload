we studied seroprevalence hepatitis b virus (hbv), hepatitis c virus (hcv)
and gb virus-c (gbv-c) infections 348 siberian natives lived the
kamchatka peninsula russia. 348 samples studied, seroprevalence of
hbsag anti-hbs 11.8% (41 348 samples) 35.9% (125 348 samples),
respectively. prevalence hcv infection 1.4% (5 348 samples), and
that gbv-c rna, using rt-pcr methods, 7.5% (26 348 samples). in
siberia, prevalences hbv gbv-c infections tenfold higher
than japan. prevalence hbsag subjects 50 years age
was significantly higher 50 years old (p < 0.05). because
hbv infection highly endemic siberia, propose community-based
mass immunization must conducted soon possible area.
