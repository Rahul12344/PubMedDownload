objective: gene therapy defined treatment acquired inherited
disease transfer genetic material. common strategies gene
therapy bladder cancer corrective, inductive cytotoxic gene therapy.
mutations p53 tumor suppressor gene common molecular genetic 
abnormalities bladder cancer p53 gene transfer human bladder cancer
cell line adenoviral vectors demonstrated cytotoxic.
however, far report adeno-associated virus-2
vector-mediated p53 gene deliveries bladder cancer. study, wild-type
p53 cdna transfected bladder cancer cells, using the
adeno-associated virus-2 vector, capability raav-wt-p53 gene therapy
in bladder cancer evaluated vitro.
method: bladder cancer cell lines 5637 transduced adeno-associated
virus-2 vectors containing wild-type human p53 gene (raav-wt-p53). gene
expression transcriptional activation p53 determined western blot
analysis. cellular growth inhibition apoptosis raav-mediated p53
transfection assessed flow cytometry. combination effect of
raav-wt-p53 cisplatin measured mtt assay.
results: virus raav efficiently enters cells expresses gene
products. gene product raav-wt-p53 cytotoxic bladder cancer cells.
the bladder cell line 5637 found experience synergistic killing effect
when raav-wt-p53 used combination cisplatin.
conclusion: raav-mediated p53 gene transfer could offer powerful novel
therapeutic approach bladder cancer.
