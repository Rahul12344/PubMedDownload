the rapid expansion west nile virus (wnv) throughout new world raised 
interest understanding population dynamics patterns dispersal of
emerging infectious diseases wildlife. wnv affects humans, although main
reservoirs various species birds. analyse prevalence of
wnv-neutralizing antibodies nearly full-grown chicks belonging seven
different species colonial waterbirds three localities southern spain.
chicks neutralizing antibodies wnv detected three species
and three localities. however, low antibody titres suggest the
presence antibodies probably due maternal transfer antibody,
presumably exposure adult birds wnv similar flavivirus at
some stage lives. analyses movements tagged birds
confirmed species antibody visit regions reports of
wnv infection past decade.
