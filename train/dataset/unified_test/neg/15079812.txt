background: t-cells expressing hsv1-tk suicide gene used the
control graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic stem cell
transplantation. develop clinical trials based strategy, have
generated good manufacturing procedures novel 'split genome' human
packaging cell line (1704 cells).
methods: minimize risk generating replication-competent retroviruses,
pol truncated remove sequences overlapping env. improve retroviral
infection selection transduced t-cells, high titers galv-pseudotyped
retroviral particles harboring bicistronic thy1-ires-tk vector coding the
cd90 gpi-anchored membrane molecule produced 1704 cells.
results: using 1704 cell supernatant optimized transduction protocol,
approximately 50% primary t-cells transduced could purified
(approximately 95%) using clinical-grade immunomagnetic beads directed against
cd90. 96% okt3/il-2-activated cd90(+)-selected t-cells killed 
by ganciclovir. cell proliferation cytokine production transduced t-cells 
and hla-restricted cytotoxicity transduced t-cell clones identical to
those non-transduced counterparts cultured conditions.
conclusions: galv-pseudotyped retroviral particles harboring bicistronic
thy1-ires-tk vector allow efficient transduction rapid selection human
t-cells conditions applicable clinical trials using new human 1704 
packaging cell line.
