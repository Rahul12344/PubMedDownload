although microtubules (mts) known important roles intracellular
transport many viruses, number reports suggest specific viral
mt-associated proteins (maps) target mts subvert distinct mt-dependent
cellular processes. precise functional importance interactions and
their roles pathogenesis, however, remain largely unresolved. assess the
association disease rabies virus (rabv) map, p3, quantitatively
compared phenotypes p3 pathogenic rabv strain, nishigahara (ni) and
a non-pathogenic ni-derivative strain, ni-ce. using confocal/live-cell imaging
and dstorm super-resolution microscopy quantify protein interactions 
mt network individual mt filaments, found interaction by
ni-ce-p3 significantly impaired compared ni-p3. correlated an
impaired capacity effect association transcription factor stat1 with
mts antagonize interferon (ifn)/stat1-dependent antiviral signaling.
importantly, identified single mutation ni-ce-p3 sufficient to
inhibit mt-association ifn-antagonist function ni-p3, showed this
mutation alone attenuates pathogenicity rabv. data provide evidence 
that viral protein-mt interface important roles pathogenesis,
suggesting interface could provide targets vaccine/antiviral drug
development.
