hepatitis delta virus (hdv) infects human hepatocytes already infected the
hepatitis b virus increasing ten fold risk cirrhosis fulminant
hepatitis. lack appropriate cell culture system capable supporting
virus replication far impaired detailed investigation hdv
biology including identification host factors involved pathogenesis.
here, made use hdv cdna stably transfected cell line, huh7-d12, a
proteomic approach identify changes protein expression profiles 
human liver cells arise consequence hdv replication. total protein
extracts huh7-d12 cells corresponding non transfected human liver
carcinoma cell line, huh7, separated 2-de. differentially expressed spots
were identified maldi-tof followed database searching. identified 23
differentially expressed proteins 15 regulated 8 up
regulated huh7-d12 cells. proteins found involved in
different cellular pathways. regulation histone h1-binding
protein triosephosphate isomerase confirmed real time pcr, 
up regulation la protein lamin a/c validated western blot.
