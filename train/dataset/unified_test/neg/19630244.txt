this report documents occurrence virulent infectious bursal disease
virus (vvibdv) northern california commercial brown pullets. diagnosis was
made multiple accessions two neighboring epidemiologically related 
ranches submitted california animal health food safety (cahfs)
laboratory. pullets, 11 14 wk age ranch (ra) ranch b (rb)
respectively, submitted infectious bursal disease virus vaccinated
flocks experiencing drastic increase mortality. december 2008 outbreak
resulted 26% 34% mortality ra rb respectively. gross histologic
lesions characteristic acute vvibdv observed. gross lesions included
edematous bursas, hemorrhages junction proventriculus gizzard
as well hemorrhages skeletal muscles. microscopic lesions included severe
lymphoid necrosis inflammation edematous bursas, lymphoid necrosis in
thymus, spleen, peyer's patches cecal tonsils. diagnosis vvibdv was
confirmed molecular characterization ibdv bursas well viral 
pathogenicity specific-pathogen-free birds. rt-pcr nucleotide sequencing
of hypervariable region vp2 (vvp2) gene segment ibdv genome was
performed ra, rb embryo passaged ra virions.the amino acids compatible
with vvibdv isolates: 222(ala), 242(ile), 256(ile), 294(ile) 299(ser) were
reported ranches. addition, nucleotide sequencing fragment of
the vp1 gene demonstrated viruses segment b genotype associated with
highly pathogenic vvibdv. inocula 10(5.5) 50% egg infective dose vvibdv
virus ra rb introduced orally two groups (g1 g2
respectively) 4 wk 2-day-old spf leghorns. 4 days postinoculation, there
was 100% (22/22) morbidity g1 g2; 91% (20/22) mortality g1; 100%
(22/22) mortality g2; 0% (0/20) morbidity 0% (0/ 20) mortality was
reported control group. first occurrence vvibdv reported
from birds united states.
