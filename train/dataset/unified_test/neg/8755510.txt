the vaccinia virus early transcription factor (vetf), heterodimeric protein
composed 82- 70-kda subunits, interacts viral early promoters both
a sequence-specific core region upstream sequence-independent region
downstream rna start site. determine vetf subunit-promoter
interactions, 32p-labeled dna targets chemically synthesized uniquely
positioned phosphorothioates azidophenacyl bromide moieties were
coupled. incubating derivatized promoter vetf exposing the
complex 302-nm light, protein denatured individual subunits
with without covalently bound dna isolated specific antiserum and
analyzed sds/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. using set 26 duplex
probes, uniquely positioned aryl azide moieties coding template
strands, found 82-kda subunit interacted primarily core
region promoter, whereas 70-kda subunit interacted downstream
region. nucleotide substitutions core region downregulate
transcription affected binding subunits: 82-kda subunit longer
exhibited specificity upstream regions promoter also bound to
downstream regions, whereas binding 70-kda subunit abolished even 
though mutations far upstream binding site. results
suggested mechanisms interaction 82-kda subunit core
sequence directs binding 70-kda subunit dna downstream.
