accumulating evidence suggests human herpesvirus type 6 (hhv-6) plays a
pathogenic role diseases central nervous system including multiple
sclerosis (ms). recent studies indicated hhv-6 dna detected with
high frequency ms lesions compared normal-appearing white matter,
implicating role hhv-6 ms pathogenesis. appears cells, which
infiltrate brain ms patients, resident oligodendrocytes harbor
hhv-6 virus ms lesions. cells infected hhv-6 elevated
proinflammatory gene expression, hypothesized hhv-6 could indirectly
cytotoxic glial cells, including oligodendrocytes. supernatants supt1
cells infected hhv-6 variant (gs u1102) variant b (z29)
significantly reduced mo3.1 cell proliferation 75% +/- 10%, 78% +/- 8% 51% 
+/- 9%, respectively. hhv-6 viral supernatants (gs u1102 z29) significantly
increased mo3.1 primary human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (opcs) cell
death, whereas primary human fetal astrocytes affected. removal hhv-6
virions proteins trypsin treatment culture supernatants not
reverse loss oligodendrocyte proliferation viability. supernatants from
hhv-6 gs u1102 cultures significantly cytotoxic mo3.1 cells or
opcs compared supernatants cells infected z29. dying
oligodendrocytes apoptotic-like phenotype toxicity not
inhibited general inhibitor apoptosis, zvad. further, oligodendrocytes 
minimal caspase-3 activation even presence staurosporine, suggesting
that cell death followed caspase-independent pathways. results indicate
that hhv-6 indirectly cytotoxic oligodendrocytes cell death is
driven primarily caspase-independent pathways.
