hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag) considered cause immunotolerance to
hepatitis b virus (hbv) newborn infants fetal hbeag exposure. study
compared anti-hbs responses hepatitis b vaccination infants born
to hbeag-positive -negative mothers respectively, investigate whether
fetal hbeag exposure may induce immunotolerance hbv. totally 265 infants who
received recommended neonatal immunoprophylaxis hepatitis b no
hbv infection included. anti-hbs levels compared 124 infants
with cord blood positive hbeag 141 infants cord blood negative hbeag 
7-12 months age. infants two groups similar age follow-up
(10.0 ± 2.3 vs 10.1 ± 2.3 months, p = 0.590). overall, 259 (97.7%) 265 infants
achieved anti-hbs levels (miu/ml) ≥10 6 (2.3%) others anti-hbs <10. of
124 hbeag-positive infants birth, 46.0%, 39.5%, 12.1%, 2.4% anti-hbs
levels (miu/ml) ≥1000, 100-999.9, 10-99.9, <10, respectively. 141
hbeag-negative infants birth, 35.5%, 48.9%, 13.5%, 2.1% showed ≥1000,
100-999.9, 10-99.9, <10, respectively. proportions anti-hbs level
between two groups comparable (all p > 0.05). additionally, the
distribution anti-hbs response levels also comparable infants with
high low hbeag levels (p = 0.818). conclusions, fetal hbeag exposure
does inhibit antibody response neonatal hepatitis b vaccination. the
data suggest hbeag appears inducing immunotolerance hbv.
