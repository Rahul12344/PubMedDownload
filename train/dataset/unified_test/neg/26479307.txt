legume lectins carbohydrate-binding proteins non-immune origin.
significant amounts lectins found phaseolus vulgaris beans far
back last century; however, many questions potential
biological roles still remain obscure. studies shown lectins are
anti-nutritional factors cause intestinal disorders. owing their
ability act toxic allergens hemagglutinins, phaseolus vulgaris
lectins grave concern human health safety. nonetheless, their
potential beneficial health effects, anti-cancer, anti-human
immunodeficiency virus (anti-hiv), anti-microbial infection, preventing mucosal
atrophy, reducing type 2 diabetes obesity, promoting nutrients absorption and
targeting drugs, immense interest. significance phaseolus vulgaris 
lectins biological researches potential biomedical applications have
placed tremendous emphasis development purification strategies to
obtain protein pure stable forms. purification strategies entail
considerations effects proteolysis, heating, gamma radiation, and
high-hydrostatic-pressure crucial outcomes either eliminating or
improving bioactivities lectins. thus, up-to-date research findings of
phaseolus vulgaris lectins different aspects anti-nutritional and
health impacts, purification strategies novel processing trends, are
systematically reviewed.
