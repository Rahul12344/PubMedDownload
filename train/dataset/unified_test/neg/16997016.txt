the concept using genetic engineering improve natural insecticidal
activity baculoviruses emerged 1980s. academic industrial 
laboratories since invested great deal effort generate genetically
modified (gm) recombinant baculoviruses dramatically improved speeds of
kill. optimal production methodologies formulations also developed,
and safety ecology recombinant baculoviruses thoroughly 
investigated. unfortunately, initial excitement generated these
technologies tempered industry made critical decision complete 
the registration process gm baculoviruses pest insect control. this
chapter, summarize developments field historical perspective
and provide opinions current status future potential the
technology. argue gm baculoviruses valuable viable tools for
pest insect control alone combination wild-type viruses. we
believe highly effective biopesticides still bright future in
modern agriculture public awareness acceptance gm organisms, including 
gm baculoviruses, increases.
