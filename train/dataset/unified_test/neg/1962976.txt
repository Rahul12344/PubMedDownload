dna samples cancer tissues diagnosed histologically squamous cell
carcinoma uterine cervix examined presence human
papillomavirus (hpv) genome dna southern blot hybridization. 63 specimens, 
32 found hybridize hpv dna probes; 23 specimens (35%) hpv type 
16 (hpv16), one (2%) hpv type 18 (hpv18), four (7%) hpv type 52b
(hpv52b), four others (7%) weakly hpv52b. specimens negative hpv dna
with southern blot hybridization subjected polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) determine presence hpv dna sensitive conditions. after
pcr using one set primers specific hpv16 hpv52b, 7 31 specimens
were found hpv16 dna. none positive hpv52b dna. results
indicate hpv52b, well hpv16 hpv18, associated squamous
cell carcinoma uterine cervix, sensitive determination hpv
infection made amplification viral genome pcr.
