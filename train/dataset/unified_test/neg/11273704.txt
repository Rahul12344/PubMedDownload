the 3'-end region genomic rna brome mosaic virus forms trna-like
structure critical replication. previous studies shown 
in region, stem-loop structure, called slc, necessary sufficient
for binding rna replicase, rna replication. recently, we
determined high-resolution nmr structure slc, demonstrated a
5'-aua-3' triloop region important structural element enzymatic
recognition. proposed 5'-adenine triloop, rigidly
fixed ("clamped") stem, key recognition element replicase. to
elucidate role "clamped base motif" enzymatic recognition, we
have investigated solution conformations several stem-loop molecules
with mutant triloops, 5'-uua-3', 5'-gua-3', 5'-cua-3' 5'-uuu-3', destroy
the enzymatic recognition. gua uua mutants, obtained
high-resolution solution structures using 2d nmr. four mutants very
similar thermodynamic stabilities, secondary structures, 
triloop five base-paired stem helix. addition, quite similar 
sugar puckering patterns triloop region. nmr structures gua and
uua show 5' nucleotide triloop (g6 gua u6 uua) lacks the
strong interactions hold base fixed position. particular, u6
of uua found two different conformations. neither two mutants 
the clamped base motif observed wild-type. uua also shows
global change overall triloop conformation, gua shows similar
triloop conformation wild-type except lack motif. the
absence clamped base motif common structural difference
between two mutants wild-type. results clearly indicate 
the loss function uua gua mutants comes mainly destruction
of small key recognition motif rather global changes triloop
conformations. based study, conclude key structural motif 
the triloop recognized replicase solution-exposed, 5'-adenine base in
the triloop clamped stem helix, called clamped adenine 
motif.
