background: although human papillomavirus (hpv) infections common young
women, rate risk repeated new infections well documented. 
we examined rate risks new hpv detection young women.
methods: used data ongoing study hpv, initiated 1990. sexually
active women ages 12 22 years eligible. interviews behaviors hpv
testing done 4-month intervals; sexually transmitted infection (sti)
testing annual symptomatic. starting first hpv detection, time 
the next (second) visit (event) detection new hpv types, the
second event time third event calculated. risks determined using
cox proportional hazard model.
results: sixty-nine percent 1,125 women second event, 
a second event, 63% third event 3 years, respectively. women hpv
persistence initial visit second event [hazard ratio (hr) = 4.51
(3.78-5.37)], sti [hr = 1.47 (1.00-2.17)], bacterial vaginosis [hr = 1.60
(1.07-2.39)], number new sex partners [hr = 1.10 (1.05-1.15 per
partner/mo)] independent associations hpv. risks third event were
similar.
conclusion: study documents repeated nature hpv infections young
women association sexual risk behaviors.
impact: finding underscores lack clinical utility hpv testing in
young women. studies needed examine host factors lead hpv 
acquisition persistence.
