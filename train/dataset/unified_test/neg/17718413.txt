objective: test effect p163 egfr-antisense cdna signal
transduction hep-2 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma vitro.
methods: hep-2 laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells transfected by
recombinant adenovirus adeasy-egfr-antisense adeasy-p16beta vitro. the
inhibition egfr expression cell growth changes cell cycle, dna 
content, apoptosis ultramicrostructure hep-2 cells examined by
mtt, western blotting analysis, flow cytometry analysis, immunohistochemistry,
and transmission electron microscope respectively. results proliferation of
the hep-2 cells inhibited significantly infection ad-
ad-p16beta ad-antisense egfr. infection also accelerated apoptosis 
the cancer cells. proport cells g0/g1 phases increased 
77.7%. ad-antisense egfr-infected cells showed lower protein expression of
egfr. p16beta protein expression observed ad-p16beta-infected
cells.
conclusion: transfection ad- ad-p16beta adantisense egfr hep-2
cells leads over-expression ad-pl6beta, under-expression egfr, along
with g1-phase arrest apoptotic cell death. egfr ad-p16beta play
important roles genesis, growth differentiation human
laryngocarcinoma cells.
