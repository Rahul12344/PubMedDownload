in process seeking good model cell line epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-associated gastric cancer, found one previously established gastric
adenocarcinoma cell line infected type 1 ebv. snu-719 cell line from
a korean patient expressed cytokeratin without cd19 cd21 expression. in
snu-719, ebna1 lmp2a expressed, lmp1 ebna2 not. none of
the tested lytic ebv proteins detected cell line unless stimulated
with phorbol ester. ebv infection also shown original carcinoma tissue
of snu-719 cell line. results support possibility cd21-independent
ebv infection gastric epithelial cells vivo. latent ebv gene
expression pattern snu-719 closely resembles ebv-associated
gastric cancer, naturally derived cell line may serve valuable model
system clarify precise role ebv gastric carcinogenesis.
