hepatic expression interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) examined by
immunohistochemistry 90 chinese patients (m/f 67:23, age: 14-69) a
spectrum hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related chronic liver diseases.
immunoreactive ifn-alpha detected sinusoidal cells 79 patients (88%)
and mononuclear cells 59 patients (65.6%). patients active liver
diseases (chronic active hepatitis, active cirrhosis, n = 55) higher level 
of ifn-alpha expression compared patients inactive histology (n = 35;
sinusoidal cells, p < 0.01; mononuclear cells, p < 0.01). cytoplasmic hbsag,
nuclear hbcag, cytoplasmic hbcag detected 79 (88%), 42 (47%), 23 
(27%) patients respectively. expression ifn-alpha mononuclear cells
correlated expression cytoplasmic hbcag (p < 0.05) with
nuclear hbcag cytoplasmic hbsag. patients divided four
different phases according natural history chronic hbv infection,
patients active liver disease phase higher ifn-alpha expression
compared immunotolerant late phase patients (p < 0.01). using double
immunohistochemical staining, ifn-alpha cytoplasmic hbcag were
frequently detected near inflammatory infiltrates correlation existed
between hepatic expression hbsag ifn-alpha. data indicate that
ifn-alpha expressed liver hbv-related active liver diseases that
the reported suboptimal production ifn-alpha pbmc hbv-related chronic
active liver diseases may due redistribution ifn-alpha-producing
mononuclear cells liver, site inflammation.
