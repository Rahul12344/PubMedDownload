interferon regulatory factor 5 (irf-5) plays role antiviral and
inflammatory responses. this study, described structure, mrna tissue
distribution regulation irf-5 gene turbot, scophthalmus maximus
(smirf-5). gene sequence smirf-5 4275 bp long, composed 9 exons 
8 introns similar known irf-5 genes vertebrates, encodes peptide of
487 amino acids. deduced protein sequence shares highest identity of
∼60-70% fish irf-5 possesses dna-binding domain (dbd), middle region
(mr), irf association domain (iad) virus activated domain (vad) known to
be important functions irf-5 mammals. phylogenetic analysis grouped
smirf-5 irf-5s vertebrates. smirf-5 transcripts detectable 
a wide range tissue types healthy fish higher levels observed the
head kidney, kidney spleen. smirf-5 transcriptionally up-regulated by
turbot reddish body iridovirus (trbiv) polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid
(poly i:c) gills, head kidney, spleen muscle. highest
inducibility earliest induction smirf-5 expression observed the
spleen reached maximum level day 1 infection, prior that
of turbot mx. findings may help better understand roles smirf-5
in antiviral response.
