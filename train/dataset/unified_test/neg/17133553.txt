torque teno virus (ttv) torque teno minivirus (ttmv) highly prevalent 
the general population although disease associated these
viruses yet, co-infections pathological viruses frequent. both
viruses extremely heterogeneous, especially dna viruses, role 
the immune system controlling infections yet established. in
this study ttv/ttmv viral loads hiv positive tissues been
investigated first time. titers ttv ttmv compared in
the bone marrow spleen tissues three groups: hiv negative individuals,
hiv positive individuals hiv positive individuals progressed aids,
leading immunosuppression. limiting dilution pcr using primers situated the
utr region genome used semi-quantitate virus, ttv ttmv
were differentiated using melting curve analysis pcr product. aids
group significantly higher titers compared hiv positive and
negative groups bone marrow (aids vs. hiv positive p = 0.006, aids vs.
hiv negative p < 0.001) spleen (aids vs. hiv positive p = 0.022, aids vs. hiv
negative p < 0.001). analysis ttv/ttmv titer cd4 lymphocyte count
showed significant inverse correlation however neither hcv co-infection type
of anellovirus infection (single ttv ttmv, mixed ttv/ttmv) showed any
significant correlation virus titer. results show link between
deterioration immune system increased viral loads studied
tissues.
