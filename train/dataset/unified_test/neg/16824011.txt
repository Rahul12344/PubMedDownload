fortunately, began research 1950 basic concepts microbial
genetics could explored experimentally. began bacteriophage lambda 
tried establish colinearity linkage map dna molecule. my
students worked regulation lambda repressor synthesis the
establishment maintenance lysogeny. also investigated proteins
responsible assembly phage head. using cell extracts, discovered
how package dna inside head vitro. around 1972, began use
molecular genetics understand developmental biology myxococcus xanthus.
in particular, wanted learn myxococcus builds multicellular fruiting
body within differentiates spores. identified two cell-to-cell
signals used coordinate development. elucidated, part, signal
transduction pathway c-signal directs morphogenesis fruiting
body.
