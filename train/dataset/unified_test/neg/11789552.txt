human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) therapies need effective and
acceptable. 10-item hiv treatment satisfaction questionnaire (hivtsq) was
validated amongst 150 hiv-1 sero-positive individuals, receiving one two
protease inhibitors part combined therapy open-label randomised
trial. scale subscale scoring determined psychometrically. was
hypothesised satisfaction control would greater amongst with
lower viral loads, satisfaction side-effects would inversely related to
severity adverse events satisfaction new treatment would be
greater control treatment. principal components analyses suggested 
that patient ratings nine items summed compute total
satisfaction scale (cronbach's alpha 0.82), and/or divided subscales:
general satisfaction/clinical (alpha 0.80) lifestyle/ease (alpha 0.74). one
item (asking demanding treatment was) needs modification before
inclusion. hivtsq showed construct validity: viral load correlated negatively
(spearman's r - 0.33 p < 0.01) satisfaction hiv control; with
<400 copies hiv-1 rna/ml satisfied hiv control with
higher viral loads (mann-whitney p < 0.01); adverse event grade correlated r -
0.18 (p < 0.05) satisfaction side-effects. hivtsq sensitive 
differences groups: compared patients control group, those
receiving new treatment significantly higher perceived flexibility and
lifestyle/ease scores week 8 (mann-whitney p < 0.01). patient perceptions 
not simply mirror clinical measures, highlighting importance measuring
patient views.
