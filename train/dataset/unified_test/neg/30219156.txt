background: studies association chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection colonic neoplasm rare. aimed investigate association
between chronic hbv infection development colonic adenoma.
materials methods: one hundred thirty-three patients chronic hbv
infection underwent colonoscopic examination, enrolled. healthy
hbv-uninfected group matched hbv group. previous
history colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases colorectal surgery
were excluded hbv hbv-uninfected groups. clinical information and
data age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption comorbidities
were obtained. advanced adenoma defined tubular adenoma ≥10mm, adenoma 
with villous component high-grade dysplasia.
results: hbv group higher rate colorectal adenoma advanced
adenoma hbv-uninfected group. patients hbv group larger
colorectal polyps hbv-uninfected group. chi square test,
hbv dna positivity significantly associated colorectal adenoma (p <
0.001) advanced adenoma (p = 0.007). hbv infection (odds ratio [or] = 23.961,
95% ci: 9.400-61.076), diabetes mellitus (or = 2.633, 95% ci: 1.071-6.473) and
age (or = 1.057, 95% ci: 1.020-1.095) significantly associated advanced
adenoma multivariable logistic regression analysis. multivariable logistic
regression analysis within hbv group revealed hbv dna (or = 1.236, 95%
ci: 1.029-1.485) associated advanced adenoma.
conclusions: hbv dna patients hbv infection hbv infection are
independently associated advanced colorectal adenoma development.
