background: haematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) solid organ transplant
(sot) recipients high risk severe influenza complications, and
may adequately protected vaccination.
methods: liver, kidney, liver-kidney transplant allogeneic hsct recipients 
aged ≥1 year randomized oseltamivir (75 mg daily ≥13 years
or weight-based dosing children 1-12 years) placebo 12 weeks during
periods local influenza circulation. patients assessed influenza
infection via daily diary, every-other-week culture pcr, baseline and
end-of-treatment serology.
results: total 477 subjects enrolled (239 oseltamivir 238 placebo);
most adults (96%) sot recipients (81%). intent-to-treat
population, frequency laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza (culture
positive and/or >4-fold increase haemagglutinin antibody inhibition [primary
end point]) similar oseltamivir placebo groups (2.1% [5/237] and
2.9% [7/238]). incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza significantly
reduced oseltamivir group versus placebo determined reverse
transcriptase-pcr (1.7% [4/237] versus 8.4% [20/238]; 95% ci 2.8, 11.1) viral 
culture (<1% [1/237] versus 3.8% [9/238]; 95% ci 0.7, 6.6), giving protective
efficacies 79.9 88.8%, respectively. serious adverse events (oseltamivir
8% placebo 10%) adverse events (oseltamivir 55% placebo 58%) were
reported arms similar frequency. one illness due to
oseltamivir-resistant a/h1n1 virus detected group.
conclusions: oseltamivir prophylaxis generally well-tolerated may reduce
culture- pcr-confirmed influenza incidence transplant recipients.
