we report clinical pathological features nine distinctive, but
relatively unknown, vascular tumors infancy childhood presenting soft
tissue masses often associated locally aggressive disease, lymphangiomatosis
and kasabach-merritt syndrome. patients, four males five females, were
all first decade life except two (median, 2 years; range, 5
months 19 years). tumors involved deep soft tissues upper
extremity (four cases), retroperitoneum (two cases), chest wall, scalp, neck 
(one case each). four patients also kasabach-merritt syndrome, three
patients lymphangiomatosis. lymphangiomatosis consisted diffusely
infiltrating lymphangioma soft tissue (three cases) two the
additional presence bone lesions. one three cases,
lymphangiomatosis antedated diagnosis vascular tumor, the
remainder concurrently diagnosed. tumors characterized by
infiltrating, interconnecting sheets irregular nodules slender endothelial 
cells lining crescentic slit-like vessels and, less commonly, rounded
capillary-type vessels. within tumors, nests epithelioid endothelial
cells prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm containing finely granular
hemosiderin, hyaline droplets, cytoplasmic vacuoles identified. smaller 
amounts hemosiderin observed within spindled endothelial cells and
microthrombi could seen occasionally within tiny lumina. nuclear atypia
was minimal within tumors mitotic figures infrequent, averaging 2 
to 3/10 high-power fields (hpf) (range 0-7/10 hpf). larger, well-formed feeding
vessels present periphery tumor. endothelium these
vessels expressed factor viii-ag, cd34, bound ulex europaeus, contained
an occasional perithelial cell expressing muscle-specific actin. contrast, the
spindled tumor cells expressed cd34. human papilloma virus (hpv)-16-like dna
transcripts, identified cases kaposi's sarcoma, not
detected polymerase chain reaction two cases. follow-up information
revealed four patients alive without disease wide excision,
multiple excision(s), amputation (one case); three alive disease;
and two died, one lymphangiomatosis respiratory compromise the
other hemorrhage complicating kasabach-merritt syndrome. appears that
treatment consist wide local excision supportive therapy for
associated symptoms.
