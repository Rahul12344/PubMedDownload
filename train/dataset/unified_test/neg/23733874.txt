we expanded human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 tax-specific ctl vitro pbmc
of three individual adult cell leukemia/lymphoma (atl) patients assessed
their therapeutic potential vivo model using nog mice bearing primary
atl cells respective three patients (atl/nog). mice established
with cells chronic-type patient, treatment i.p. injection autologous
tax-ctl resulted greater infiltration cd8-positive cells atl
lesion. associated significant decrease atl cell infiltration 
into blood, spleen, liver. tax-ctl treatment also significantly decreased
human soluble il-2r concentrations sera. another group atl/nog mice,
tax-ctl treatment led significant prolongation survival time. these
findings show tax-ctl infiltrate tumor site, recognize, kill
autologous atl cells mice vivo. atl/nog mice cells an
acute-type patient, whose postchemotherapeutic remission continued >18 mo,
antitumor efficacy adoptive tax-ctl therapy also observed. however, in
atl/nog mice different acute-type patient, whose atl relapsed 6 mo
of remission, efficacy observed. thus, although therapeutic effects
were different different atl patients, best knowledge, 
the first report adoptive therapy ag-specific ctl expanded a
cancer patient confers antitumor effects, leading significant survival benefit
for autologous primary cancer cell-bearing mice vivo. present study
contributes research adoptive ctl therapy, applicable to
several types cancer.
