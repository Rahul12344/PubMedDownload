herpesviruses evolved unique mechanism nuclear egress nascent
progeny nucleocapsids: nucleocapsids bud inner nuclear membrane
into perinuclear space inner outer nuclear membranes (primary
envelopment), enveloped nucleocapsids fuse outer nuclear
membrane release nucleocapsids cytoplasm (de-envelopment). have
shown herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) major virion structural protein
ul47 (or vp13/vp14) novel regulator hsv-1 nuclear egress. particular,
we demonstrated following: (i) ul47 formed complex(es) hsv-1 proteins 
ul34, ul31, and/or us3, reported critical viral
nuclear egress, viral proteins colocalized nuclear membrane in
hsv-1-infected cells; (ii) ul47-null mutation considerably reduced primary
enveloped virions perinuclear space although capsids accumulated the
nucleus; (iii) ul47 detected primary enveloped virions the
perinuclear space immunoelectron microscopy. results suggested ul47
promoted hsv-1 primary envelopment, probably interacting critical
hsv-1 regulators viral nuclear egress modulating their
functions.importance: like herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1)
has evolved vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism nuclear 
egress nascent progeny nucleocapsids. although previous reports identified and
characterized several hsv-1 cellular proteins involved viral nuclear
egress, complete details hsv-1 nuclear egress remain elucidated. this
study, presented data suggesting (i) major hsv-1 virion
structural protein ul47 (or vp13/vp14) formed complex known viral
regulatory proteins critical viral nuclear egress (ii) ul47 played a
regulatory role hsv-1 primary envelopment. thus, identified ul47 novel
regulator hsv-1 nuclear egress.
