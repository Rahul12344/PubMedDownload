oncolytic viruses offer promising new modality cancer treatment. the
strategy therapy develop viruses capable selectively infecting
and replicating malignant tumor cells. oncolytic viruses spread and
destroy malignant tumors without deleterious effects normal tissues. these
viruses genetically engineered based biology replicating
viruses major genetic defects human cancer cells, can
replicate cancer cells normal cells. key development 
such viruses identification viral genes, deletion modification
of enables tumor-specific cell destruction. several clinical trials have
demonstrated safety oncolytic viruses cancer therapy also
shown encouraging results. much evidence suggests oncolytic viral
therapy works synergy standard cancer therapies. review, 
focus oncolytic viruses may beneficial patients lung
cancer near future.
