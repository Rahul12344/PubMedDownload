we converted tacaaa sequence present position -29 adenovirus
eiia late promoter canonical tata box oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis. linear templates analyzed nuclear extracts,
transcription mutant promoter showed 10-fold higher level activity
than wild-type promoter. increase correlated an
increased affinity mutant promoter transcription initiation factor
iid. analyses demonstrated activating functions three eiia
late upstream promoter elements (huang, d.-h., roeder, r.g. (1988) mol. cell.
biol. 8, 1906-1914) maintained mutant promoter background. these
observations indicated, first, upstream elements act merely to
overcome rate-limiting initiation step imposed inefficient tata element
and, second, strength interaction transcription
initiation factor iid tata box directly related promoter activity.
