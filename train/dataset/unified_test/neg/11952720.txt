the use highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) extended lifespan
of patients infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). prognosis of
hiv infection improved, liver disease associated hepatitis c virus (hcv)
has become clinically significant patients hiv, liver failure a
frequent cause death population. hiv infection may accelerate the
course liver disease patients co-infected hcv, infection hcv
should treated like opportunistic disease patients.
nowadays, combination therapy interferon-alpha ribavirin standard
treatment chronic hepatitis c hiv-negative patients. preliminary results
of combination therapy hiv/hcv co-infected patients promising,
showing sustained response rate 40% patients. patients higher 
cd4 counts lower hcv/hiv viral load infected hcv genotype 3a
have better response therapy. potential drug interactions haart
therapy interferon ribavirin treatment emphasize importance of
initiating treatment hcv infection hiv-positive individuals soon as
possible ideally need anti-hiv therapy. recent case reports
have suggested liver transplantation might appropriate procedure in
hiv patients undetectable hiv viral load, high cd4 counts hcv advanced
liver disease. however, limited amount available information the
complexities drug interactions haart therapy immunosuppressive
drugs oblige us prudent within considering procedure.
