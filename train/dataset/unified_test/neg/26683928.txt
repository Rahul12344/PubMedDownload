recently increasing high-risk hpv+ oscc exhibits unique clinical molecular
characteristics compared hpv-unrelated (hpv-) counterpart. genomic copy number
variations (cnvs), unique hpv+ osccs, role prognosis
prediction remains poorly studied. here, analyzed distinct genomic copy
number variations (cnvs) human papillomavirus-related (hpv+) oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) role prognosticator curative 
resection. 58 consecutive, korean oscc patients underwent surgery-based 
treatment median 10 years follow-up, hpv-related markers, genome-wide
cnv analysis analyzed. clinical associations cnv profile and
survival analyses followed. p16 expression predicted overall survival
(os) (hazard ratio [hr] = 0.27, confidence interval [ci]: 0.39-0.80, p = 0.0006) 
better hpv l1 pcr (hr = 0.83, ci: 0.66-1.29, p = 0.64), smoking, other
variables. although overall number cnvs significantly different,
30 loci showed unique cnv patterns p16+ p16- groups. region
containing prdm2 amplified p16+ group, whereas egfr 11q13.3
showed increased amplification p16- counterpart. loss locus containing
fgf18 led worse, gain region including cdk10 rad18 led better 
overall survival (os) oscc patients. meanwhile, subgroup analysis p16+ 
oscc revealed amplification regions harboring hras loss locus
bearing kdr led better os. p16+ oscc exhibit distinct cnv patterns compared
with p16- counterpart. specific patterns cnvs predict better survival,
especially p16+ oscc. might allow better insights outcome after
curative resection hpv+ hpv- oscc.
