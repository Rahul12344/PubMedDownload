periventricular germinal zones (gzs) developing adult brain contain neural
stem cells (nscs), cellular identities origins defined
completely. used tissue culture techniques transgenic mice expressing
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (hsv-tk) mouse glial fibrillary
acid protein (gfap) promoter test hypothesis certain nscs express
gfap. so, determined relative proportions multipotent
neurospheres formed gfap-expressing cells derived gzs at
different stages development. transgenic model, dividing
gfap-expressing cells ablated selectively treatment antiviral
agent ganciclovir (gcv). single-cell analysis showed transgene-derived
hsv-tk present gfap-expressing cells. gcv applied vitro eliminated
growth multipotent neurospheres gzs postnatal adult transgenic
mice early embryonic (embryonic day 12.5) transgenic mice. gcv prevented 
growth secondary multipotent neurospheres prepared passage primary
transgenic neurospheres derived three developmental stages. 
addition, gcv prevented growth multipotent neurospheres transgenic
astrocyte-enriched cell cultures derived postnatal gz, elaidic acid gcv 
given 4 adult transgenic mice vivo abolished ability grow
multipotent neurospheres gz. extensive control experiments, including clonal
analysis, demonstrated failure neurosphere growth merely
secondary loss gfap-expressing support cells result nonspecific
toxic effect. findings demonstrate predominant multipotent nscs
isolated postnatal adult early embryonic gzs express gfap, and
that nscs exhibit heterogeneous expression intermediate filaments during
developmental maturation.
