this study characterizes persistence human norovirus eastern oysters
(crassostrea virginica) held different seawater temperatures. oysters were
contaminated human norovirus gi.1 (norwalk strain 8fiia) exposing to
virus-contaminated water 15 °c, subsequently holding 7, 15, and
25 °c 6 weeks. viral rna extracted oyster tissue hemocytes
and quantitated rt-qpcr. norovirus detected hemocytes oysters held 
at 7 15 °c 6 weeks hemocytes oysters held 25 °c 2
and 4 weeks, respectively. results confirm nov quite persistent within
oysters demonstrate cooler water temperatures extend norovirus clearance
times. study suggests need substantial relay times remove norovirus
from contaminated shellfish suggests regulatory authorities should
consider effects water temperature suspected episodic
norovirus-contamination event.
