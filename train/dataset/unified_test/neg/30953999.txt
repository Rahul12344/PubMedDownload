the acaricidal bioactivity oxymatrine-based commercial formulation 
brevipalpus yothersi baker (acari: tenuipalpidae), vector mite citrus
leprosis virus (cilv), impact predatory mites assessed. 
purpose, laboratory field assays using bioacaricide concentrations ranging
from 0.5 2.0 mg l-1 oxymatrine performed years 2015 to
2016. laboratory results showed oxymatrine-based commercial formulation 
does cause deleterious effects b. yothersi eggs; however, causes high
larval mortality. adult females, bioacaricide caused high acute toxicity 
and residual effect least 5 days application. field, the
bioacaricide exhibited high acaricidal activity b. yothersi, with
efficacy levels similar synthetic acaricide spirodiclofen (48 mg l-1) 
until 49 days application. application bioacaricide 
negatively affect population levels phytoseiid predatory mites. therefore,
our results suggest oxymatrine-based commercial formulation an
important tool management citrus leprosis mite citrus groves.
