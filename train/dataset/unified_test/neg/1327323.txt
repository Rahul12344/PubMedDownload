we investigated intestinal absorption macromolecule human
alpha-lactalbumin episode acute gastroenteritis in
children. twenty children studied acute phase 17 excreted
rotavirus. eleven children studied 5-8 weeks later (convalescent
phase). human alpha-lactalbumin serum concentrations acute phase were
similar convalescent phase significantly (p less 0.001)
higher reference children. serum concentrations also
higher convalescent acute phase (p = 0.021). study
suggests increased absorption proteins gut 
circulation 5-8 weeks rotavirus gastroenteritis.
