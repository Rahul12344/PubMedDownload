we previously shown intravesical administration adenovirus encoding 
human interferon alpha-2b (ad-ifn) induced marked regression superficial
human bladder tumors derived cells resistant 1 million
units/ml ifnalpha protein vitro. addition, ad-ifn appeared produce
strong bystander effects. study, show ad-ifn causes marked
inhibition cell growth apoptosis cells various tumor types, of
which resistant ifnalpha protein. addition, strong perinuclear ifn
staining seen cell lines following ad-ifn transfection never
observed exposure ifn protein. ad-ifn induced proteolytic processing
of caspases 3, 8 9, indicative enzymatic activation. however, the
caspase-8-selective inhibitor, ietdfmk, blocked apoptosis cell lines 
that sensitive ifnalpha protein minimal effect on
ad-ifn-induced caspase-3 -9 processing cell death, indicating death
receptor-independent mechanism(s) involved cytotoxic effects observed
for cancer cell lines resistant ifnalpha protein. moreover, document
that yet identified soluble factor(s) responsible causing the
bystander effect observed following ad-ifn treatment ifn protein-resistant
cancer cells.
