the binding monoclonal antibodies obtained immunization tobacco
mosaic protein analyzed electron microscopy. method developed for
visualizing viral antigen reacting different elisa procedures. was
found use ph 9.6 buffer coating elisa plates led to
the dissociation virions subunits bound preferentially solid
phase. mabs reacted virions subunits elisa found to
bind one two extremities viral rods. mabs also reacted with
viral protein aggregated form disks. contrast, mabs reacting only
with virions elisa found bind entire surface virus.
