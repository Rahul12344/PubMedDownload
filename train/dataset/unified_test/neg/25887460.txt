background: elderly people increased risk severe influenza illness and
constitute therefore major target-group seasonal influenza vaccination in
most industrialized countries. aim study estimate influenza
vaccine effectiveness (ve) among individuals aged 60+ years three seasons
and assess screening method suitable tool monitor influenza 
in particular target-group germany.
methods: identified laboratory-confirmed influenza cases aged 60+ years
through national communicable disease reporting system seasons 2010/11,
2011/12 2012/13. vaccination coverage (vc) data retrieved a
database health insurance claims representing ~85% total german
population. applied screening method calculate influenza
subtype-specific compared results estimates other
observational studies europe.
results: total, 7,156 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases included. ve
against influenza types ranged 49% (95% confidence interval [ci]:
39-56) 2011/12 80% (95% ci: 76-83%) 2010/11. 2010/11
subtype-specific influenza a(h1n1)pdm b 76% 84%,
respectively. following seasons, influenza a(h1n1)pdm, a(h3n2) 
and b 87%, -9% , 74% (2011/12), 74%, 39%, 73% (2012/13). higher
among hospitalized compared non-hospitalized influenza cases. seventeen
observational studies europe reporting subtype-specific among elderly
were identified respective seasons (all applying test-negative
design) showed comparable subtype-specific estimates.
conclusions: according study, influenza vaccination provided moderate
protection laboratory-confirmed influenza a(h1n1)pdm b individuals
aged 60+ little protection a(h3n2). higher among
hospitalized cases might indicate higher protection severe influenza
disease. based available data, screening method allowed us assess
subtype-specific hospitalized non-hospitalized elderly persons. since
controlling several important confounders possible, applied
method provided crude estimates. however, given precise vc-data and
the large number cases, screening method provided results line
with estimates observational studies europe applied a
different study design.
