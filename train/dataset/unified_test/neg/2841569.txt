we constructed several plasmids test specificity target selection 
for is102 associated deletions. previously shown ciii region of
phage lambda target is102 mediated deletions region was
therefore introduced psc101, is102 resides, way was
silent, transcribed fully expressed. deletion selection provided by
the galactokinase system. results obtained show transcription of
the target region required deletion formation. frequency deletions 
in target depends position along transcript also
influenced translation. implications results regional
specificity transposition discussed.
