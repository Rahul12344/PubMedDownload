the following review emerging topic literature led to
new hypotheses regarding mechanisms pathogenesis various tissue
specific aids associated syndromes. fundamental hypothesis review
proposes hiv-1 able increase lymphocyte monocyte localization in
tissues released hiv-1 proteins cause local tissue damage leading any
one various aids associated syndromes. also hypothesized that
syndromes associated lymphotrophic viruses result ability 
these viruses direct leukocyte extravasation blood vessel walls to
initiate tissue specific pathogenesis. further, suggested new
concepts strategies delivering gene therapy specific tissues be
derived understanding mechanisms lymphotrophic
viruses localize specific tissues. hiv-1 infection lymphocytes and
monocytes leads increased adhesion cells vascular endothelium 
extracellular matrix molecules. addition, hiv-1 infection various
leukocytes leads increased secretion extracellular matrix degrading matrix 
metalloproteinases. increases leukocyte adhesion matrix metalloproteinase 
secretion associated normal mechanisms leukocytes
localize tissues inflammation. ability hiv-1 activate
leukocyte adhesion matrix metalloproteinase secretion suggests hiv-1 has
evolved way take advantage leukocyte inflammatory mechanisms order 
exit blood stream gain access body tissues. ability hiv-1 to
use infected cells localize various tissues may lead establishment
of hiv-1 reservoirs tissues. viral reservoirs may cause various
tissue specific aids associated syndromes. aids patients found 
elevated adhesion molecules (integrins, cell adhesion molecules cams) on
their peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). little clinical
evidence tissue localization hiv-1 infected leukocytes cause 
of hiv-1 related syndromes, studies vitro animal models have
shown hiv-1 gene products tat, rev gp120 potent neurotoxins. 
has also shown tat contribute growth cells kaposi's 
sarcoma lesions. further, hiv-1 infected cells shown secrete
cytotoxic levels variety growth factors small molecules. thus, 
likely localization hiv-1 infected cells specific tissues could
contribute hiv-1 associated syndromes aids dementia, hiv-1 related
interstitial lung disease, hiv-1 associated nephropathy, hiv-1 wasting
syndrome perhaps aids associated kaposi's sarcoma hyperproliferative skin
disorders. review examine studies literature demonstrate
that hiv-1 infection increases leukocyte adhesion matrix metalloproteinase
secretion. clinical reports aids patient's leukocyte integrin levels also
be reviewed evidence tissue localized hiv-1 infected cells could
contribute variety hiv-1 associated syndromes presented.
