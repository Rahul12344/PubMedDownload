objectives: examine risk factors lower respiratory tract infections (lrti)
hospital admission canadian arctic.
methods: case-control study 14-month period among children
less 2 years age. cases admitted baffin regional hospital 
iqaluit, nunavut lrti. controls age matched came iqaluit 2
communities. odds ratios (ors) hospital admission lrti estimated
through multivariate conditional logistic regression modeling following risk 
factors: smoking pregnancy, inuit race, prematurity, adoption status,
breast-feeding, overcrowding, residing outside iqaluit. viruses in
nasophayngeal aspirates sought time hospital admission.
results: 101 age-matched cases controls. following risk
factors significantly associated increased risk admission for
lrti (adjusted or): smoking pregnancy (or = 4.0; 95% ci: 1.1-14.6), residence 
outside iqaluit (or = 2.7; 95% ci: 1.0 -7.2), full inuit race (or = 3.8; 95%
ci: 1.1-12.8), overcrowding (or = 2.5, 95% ci: 1.1- 6.1). non-breast-fed
children 3.6-fold risk admitted lrti (95% ci: 1.2-11.5) and
non-breast-fed adopted children 4.4-fold increased risk (95% ci: 1.1-17.6) 
when compared breast-fed, nonadopted children. prematurity not
associated increased risk admission. viruses identified 88
(72.7%) admissions, respiratory syncytial virus identified the
majority admissions, 62 (51.2%). multiple viruses isolated 19 (15.7%) 
admissions.
conclusions: smoking pregnancy, place residence, inuit race, lack of
breast-feeding, overcrowding independently associated increased
risk hospital admission lrti among inuit children less 2 years of
age. future research role adoption genetics health inuit 
children required.
