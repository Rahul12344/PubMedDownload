the innate immune system uses different mechanisms respond infectious
pathogens. experiments evaluating requirements type 1 ifn
(ifn-alphabeta) response lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) resulted in
the surprising discovery mice deficient b cell development, i.e.,
rag-deficient scid, profoundly reduced levels ifn-alphabeta serum
and spleen, despite high viral replication. addition lacking adaptive
immune system, strains exhibit aberrant splenic architecture, the
defect type 1 ifn production also observed mice lacking normal splenic 
marginal zone (mz) organization due genetic deficiencies b cell development
or cytokine functions required development mz, i.e., mumt,
lymphotoxin-alpha, tnfr1. interestingly, ifn-alphabeta reduction 
observed murine cmv infection. depletion phagocytic cells normally 
developed spleens treatment clodronate-containing liposomes demonstrated 
that populations required type 1 ifn response lcmv, not
to murine cmv, control viral replication. complete repopulation the
mz necessary restore normal ifn-alphabeta production. contrast, control
of lcmv replication correlated return cd11c+ cells. taken together,
these results demonstrate complexity sophistication splenic mz 
sensing responding particular pathogens reveal importance organ
architecture production type 1 ifn.
