a rapid quantitative assay developed determine cytomegalovirus infectious 
units. assay yielded results three days. rapid quantitation of
cytomegalovirus infectivity developed evaluating number cells 
expressed cytomegalovirus-late antigens end single replication cycle 
(62 h post-infection). late antigens visualized immunoalkaline
phosphatase staining using monoclonal antibody major viral capsid
protein (66.8 kda). thirty-five cytomegalovirus samples examined. values
of infectious units obtained immunoalkaline phosphatase staining were
correlated significantly values determined classical
plaque-forming technique.
