the aim study assess role cytology, human papilloma virus
(hpv) dna human papilloma virus messenger rna (hpv mrna) assays detecting 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (cni 2+) (recurrences/persistence)
during follow-up women treatment cervical intraepithelial lesion.
this cross-sectional study performed among 43 women treated cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) january 2014 january 2017 the
department obstetrics gynecology spedali civili's hospital, brescia,
italy. pap smear cervical samples hpv tests collected the
follow-up visit. furthermore, colposcopy always performed order find
out persistence/recurrence disease. cervical biopsy collected
when necessary. cervical samples obtained tested hpv dna using the
inno-lipa hpv assay hpv mrna using aptima assay. mean age of
enrolled women 42.5 years. among treated patients, 50% women
revealed absence high risk hpv dna hpv mrna. found persistence 
of disease cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (cin 2) one
woman. sensitivity cytology, hpv dna hpv mrna detecting disease was
satisfactory (100%), specificity quite different three
tests: 64.2, 52.4 78.9%, respectively. hpv mrna test higher
specificity respect cytology hpv dna, avoiding referral to
unnecessary colposcopy improvement costs/benefits healthcare
system. however, given small size sample, study considered 
a pilot future larger studies.
