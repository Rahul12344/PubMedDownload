inhibition hepatocarcinogenesis crucial issue treating chronic
hepatitis c patients, especially respond completely to
interferon therapy. interferon reported reduce incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) sustained virological responders but
also transient biochemical responders. however, incidence hcc increases
in 5 years interferon therapy transient biochemical responders. 
the aim study assess whether interferon retreatment reduces the
incidence hcc chronic hepatitis c patients hepatitis c virus was
not eradicated initial interferon therapy. enrolled 309 patients who
were sustained virological responders initial interferon treatment
consisting total dose 250 megaunits interferon were
followed 2 years treatment. ninety-nine patients received
interferon retreatment 210 not. two courses interferon therapy were
administered 84, three courses 14 five courses one. incidence of
hcc compared patients retreatment without. the
clinical characteristics, retreated patients younger followed a
longer time period. cumulative incidence hcc significantly lower in
retreated patients. multivariate analysis, patients' age (p=0.018) the
number courses interferon therapy (p=0.022) independently associated
with hcc incidence. results suggest interferon retreatment reduces 
delays incidence hcc chronic hepatitis c patients not
completely respond initial therapy.
