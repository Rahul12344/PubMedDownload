human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rev protein known regulate 
expression proteins via binding rna site termed hiv rev response
element (rre) presumably defined shape, mediated mainly electrostatic
interactions. developed quantitative method based ce-lif detection
for systematic evaluation interactions truncated rre (trre) rna
and hiv-1 rev peptide. employing fluorescently labeled hiv-1 rev protein
fragment (revf) probe, buffers evaluated separation and
detection well rna shape-specific formation complex.
selection optimal buffer condition allowed us perform quantitation of
the trre-revf complex formation determine dissociation constant. in
addition, competitive inhibitions rna-peptide interaction some
aminoglycosides evaluated quantitatively monitoring complex peak,
resulting determination ic(50) values. sensitive reliable
ce-lif-based method would interest developing various screening systems 
for rna interference drug discovery.
