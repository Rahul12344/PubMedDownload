18 60 cases carcinoma arising nasal cavities (nc) paranasal
sinuses (ps) using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna extracted from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. cases scc (n = 49), authors 
also compared clinical features patients hpv-positive and
hpv-negative results determine clinical significance hpv. hpv 16 18
were detected 7 49 cases (14%) scc. histologic types of
carcinoma (n = 11), neither hpv 16 hpv 18 detected. significant
differences clinical features observed patients scc with
hpv-positive hpv-negative results. results suggest hpv 16 18 are
implicated pathogenesis scc arising nc ps. however, the
presence hpv related local progression, occurrence metastases, or
the prognosis patients.
