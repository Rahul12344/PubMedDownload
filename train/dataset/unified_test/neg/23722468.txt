background: somatostatin receptor 1 (sstr1) preferentially methylated in
epstein-barr virus (ebv)-positive gastric cancer using promoter methylation
array. aimed analyse epigenetic alteration biological function of
sstr1 ebv-associated gastric cancer (ebvagc).
methods: promoter methylation examined combined bisulphite restriction
analysis (cobra) pyrosequencing. biological functions sstr1 were
evaluated loss- gain-of-function assays.
results: promoter hypermethylation sstr1 detected ebv-positive gastric 
cancer cell lines (ags-ebv) sstr1 transcriptional silence, in
ebv-negative gastric cancer cell lines sstr1 expression. expression level of
sstr1 restored ags-ebv exposure demethylating agent. moreover,
methylation level sstr1 significantly higher ebv-positive primary
gastric cancers compared ebv-negative gastric cancers (p=0.004). knock-down 
of sstr1 gastric cancer cell lines (ags bgc823) increased cell
proliferation colony formation ability, promoted g1 s-phase
transition, enhanced cell migration invasive ability. contrast, ectopic
expression sstr1 gastric cancer cell lines (mkn28 mgc803) significantly
suppressed cell growth culture conditions reduced tumour size nude
mice. tumour suppressive effect sstr1 associated upregulation 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16, p15, p27 p21); downregulation of
oncogenes (myc mdm2), key cell proliferation pro-survival regulators
(pi3kr1, akt, bcl-xl met); inhibition migration/invasion-related
genes (integrins, mmp1 (matrix metallopeptidase 1), plaur (plasminogen activator 
urokinase receptor) il8 (interleukin 8)).
conclusion: somatostatin receptor 1 novel methylated gene driven ebv
infection gastric cancer cells acts potential tumour suppressor.
