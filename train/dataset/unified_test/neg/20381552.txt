the novel influenza (h1n1) virus emerged april 2009 mexico has
spread rapidly many countries initiated human pandemic. important 
to determine whether virus existed in, spread to, normal
household animals, whether (h1n1)-like viruses derived animal is
able proliferate cell lines derived human. current paper,
familiar animals, including pigs, chickens, ducks, cats, dogs, rats, mice, and
brandt's voles challenged novel influenza (h1n1) virus, and
genetic variations viral genome analyzed three passages 
susceptible animals. determine virulence animals derived 
influenza (h1n1)-like viruses, viral replication dynamic curves monitored 
after inoculation mdck cells human a549 cells. results indicated 
pigs, balb/c mice, brandt's voles, chickens, ducks, cats, dogs, and
rats, could infected novel influenza (h1n1) virus. genome sequence
alignment results showed one genetic variation (g408t) ha
gene brandt's vole derived virus another one (c194a) na gene of
balb/c mice derived virus, virulence two viruses mdck and
a549 cells significantly lower virus originally derived human
beings.
