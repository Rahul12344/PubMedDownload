seven internal, putatively exposed regions escherichia coli beta-galactosidase
have explored regarding tolerance insertions large foreign
peptides. small sequence modifications, including amino acid substitutions and
small deletions, introduced lacz gene generate unique bamhi
restriction sites. using mutant genes, 27 amino acid stretch
reproducing hypervariable loop foot-and-mouth disease virus vp1 protein
(site a) inserted predefined regions enzyme. among 13
resulting engineered proteins three, carrying sequence modifications within 
a short region, active, moderate reduction specific
activities. identified permissive region, involves amino acids 275 to
279, seems flexible area could appropriate incorporate and
study biological properties heterologous peptides correctly folded
beta-galactosidase chimeric proteins.
