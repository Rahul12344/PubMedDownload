wide array bacteria, fungi, eukaryotic parasites viruses, that, at
steady state (homeostasis), community microbes establishes friendly
mutual relationship host. term microbiota originally meant to
represent ecological community commensals potentially pathogenic
microbes live within bodies, used interchangeably the
term microbiome initially meant represent collective genome the
microbiota. although number microbes live body was
previously estimated outnumber hosts 10 1, latest
estimate put ratio closer 1:1. hand, collective
genomes (microbiome) outnumber host 100-200 times. not
surprising therefore microbes provide host variety

non-communicable diseases like obesity, metabolic syndromes (e.g., diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases), allergy inflammatory diseases. emerging

suggesting microbes may play role neurological disorders well
