the transcription various viral cellular genes regulated palindromic
and nonpalindromic dna sites resembling ep element hepatitis b virus
enhancer, generate similar dna-protein complexes. upper ep complex
contains homodimers transcription regulator rfx1. show rfx1
possesses split, extended dimerization domain composed several
evolutionarily conserved boxes, one previously shown mediate
dimerization. unusually long complex dimerization domain could
potentially serve generating multiple complexes. addition the
previously characterized complex, rfx1 generated novel dna-protein complex of
extremely low mobility, formed palindromic dna sites. different
deletions within dimerization domain altered relative abundance the
two complexes, suggesting interplay them. formation low
mobility complex correlated transcriptional repression, both
activities mediated several portions conserved region. results
propose mechanism extended dimerization domain mediates the
formation alternative homodimeric complexes, differ nature the
intersubunit interaction. participating different types interactions,
this domain may regulate relative abundance different complexes, thus 
affecting transcriptional activity.
