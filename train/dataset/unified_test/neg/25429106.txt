the coupling transcription associated processes shown be
dependent rna polymerase ii (rnapii) c-terminal repeat domain (ctd) and
the phosphorylation heptad repeats composed (consensus
sequence y1s2p3t4s5p6s7). two primary s2 position ctd kinases been
identified higher eukaryotes: p-tefb cdk12/cyclink. recently
discovered cdk12 appears act 3'-end transcription unit has
been identified tumor suppressor ovarian cancer; however much still
unknown vivo roles cdk12/cyclink. effort further
characterize roles purified near homogeneity characterized, 
full-length, active, human cdk12/cyclink, identified hcdk12-associated
proteins via mass spectrometry. find employing "2a" peptide-linked
multicistronic construct containing cdk12 cyclink results efficient
production active, recombinant enzyme baculovirus/sf9 expression
system. using gst-ctd fusion protein substrates find cdk12/cyclink
prefers substrate unmodified repeats one mimics prephosphorylation
at s7 position ctd; also enzyme sensitive inhibitor
flavopiridol higher concentrations. identification cdk12-associating
proteins reveals strong enrichment rna-processing factors suggesting that
cdk12 affects rna processing events two distinct ways: indirectly through
generating factor-binding phospho-epitopes ctd elongating rnapii and
directly binding specific factors.
