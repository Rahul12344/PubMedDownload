solid phase radioimmunoassay detection anti-blv antibodies sera of
infected animals described. viral antigens bound surface polystyrene are
able selectively adsorb antibodies serum. detection bound antibodies 
quantitatively done 125i-labeled protein staphylococcus aureus.
technical details assay reported. assay could used as
competitive one well. two different methods detection anti-blv
