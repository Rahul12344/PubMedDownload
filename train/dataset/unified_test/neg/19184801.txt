detection endogenous avian leukosis virus envelope chicken plasma using r2 
antiserum.

immunologic tolerance oncogenic avian leukosis virus (alv) mediated, in
part, interaction endogenous alv (ev) envelope immune competent
cells. flow cytometry method described detecting ev envelope in
chicken plasma serum. method employs two types target red blood cells
(rbc) obtained chickens lacking ev; rbc susceptible ev infection
(containing ev receptors), resistant ev infection (lacking ev
receptors). rbc susceptible chickens bind ev envelope glycoprotein
(gp85) present plasma. gp85-bound rbc subsequently incubated with
a highly specific chicken alloantibody, termed r2. using flow cytometry, gp85 
detected indirectly fluoresceine-tagged antibody chicken
immunoglobulin; plasmas lacking gp85 nonreactive fluorescence remains 
a background level. rbc resistant chickens nonreactive
regardless presence absence ev gp85, specific binding index was
calculated compare relative binding ev gp85 susceptible resistant
rbc, thus identify chickens express ev gp85. specificity the
assay demonstrated using plasma chickens 14 standard laboratory lines
previously defined ev envelope expression including two sets highly
congenic lines differ ev expression. assay detects differences
attributable ev gp85 chickens commercial breeding lines white
leghorns broilers. moreover, chickens lack ev, r2 plasma assay can
differentiate ev-susceptible evresistant siblings.
