the outbreak 2009 influenza pandemic underscored important role of
swine influenza virus evolution emergence novel viruses with
pandemic potential. vaccination common practice control swine
influenza swine industry. influenza virus-like particle (vlp) vaccines 
alternative approach demonstrated immunogenic confer
protection influenza virus challenge chickens, mice ferrets. in
this study, generated vlps consisting ha, na m1 proteins derived from
pandemic virus a/california/04/2009 insect cells. immunogenicity and
efficacy following vaccination vlps evaluated swine. data showed
that vaccination using vlps elicited robust levels serum igg, mucosal iga, and
viral neutralizing antibodies a/sw/manitoba/mafri32/2009 h1n1. following 
challenge pandemic h1n1 2009, vaccinated pigs protected, displaying
reduced lung lesions, virus shedding inhibition virus replication the
lungs compared non-vaccinated control pigs. thus, vlps serve a
promising vaccination strategy control influenza swine.
