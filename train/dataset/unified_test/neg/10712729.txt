glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) key enzyme the
glycolytic metabolism production energy. probably explains why
gapdh evidenced major therapeutical target several parasitic
diseases; either vaccine candidate target chemotherapeutic
treatments. schistosoma mansoni gapdh (sm37-gapdh) one main schistosome
vaccine candidates. production recombinant sm37-gapdh essential to
evaluate ability molecule induce protective immunity animals
and possibly humans. cdna encoding sm37-gapdh cloned and
sequenced. addition, five b cell (including major b-cell epitope sm35-5)
and two cell epitopes localized molecule. different expression
systems evaluated respect production yield gapdh
enzymatic activity. led either high production of
insoluble material (e. coli) inactive enzyme (pischia pastoris). the
present article describes production setting rsm37-gapdh using the
baculovirus-insect cell system. large amounts soluble rsm37-gapdh with
enzymatic activity obtained. sera individuals living area
endemic s. mansoni recognised rsm37 molecule inhibited catalytic 
activity.
