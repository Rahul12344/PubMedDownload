polarized epithelial cells represent primary barrier virus infection of
the host, must also traversed prior virus dissemination the
infected organism. although considerable information available
concerning release enveloped viruses cells, relatively little is
known processes involved dissemination nonenveloped viruses. 
we used two polarized epithelial cell lines, vero c1008 (african green
monkey kidney epithelial cells) caco-2 (human intestinal epithelial cells),
infected poliovirus investigated process virus release. release
of poliovirus observed occur almost exclusively apical cell
surface caco-2 cells, whereas infected vero c1008 cells exhibited
nondirectional release. structures consistent vectorial transport of
virus contained within vesicles viral aggregates observed electron
microscopy. treatment monensin ammonium chloride partially inhibited
virus release caco-2 cells. significant cell lysis observed the
times postinfection extracellular virus initially detected, and
transepithelial resistance vital dye uptake measurements showed a
moderate decrease. brefeldin found significantly specifically
inhibit poliovirus biosynthetic processes yet uncharacterized mechanism.
the vectorial release poliovirus apical (or luminal) surface human
intestinal epithelial cells significant implications viral pathogenesis
in human gut.
