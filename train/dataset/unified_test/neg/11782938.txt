the occurrence rhinovirus infections cohort 329 children the
first 2 years life determined virus detection serological methods. 
rhinovirus detection nasopharyngeal aspirates middle ear fluids comprised 
a combination virus isolation hela ohio cells reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)-hybridization assay the
inoculated cell cultures. nasopharyngeal aspirates collected child 
was referred study clinic respiratory symptoms. nasopharyngeal 
aspirates middle ear fluids collected clinical diagnosis an
acute otitis media. complement-fixing antibodies rhinovirus determined
from scheduled serum specimens collected 6, 12, 18, 24 months age and
from paired sera taken cases acute otitis media. rhinovirus infections 
were shown common infants, 24% children complement-fixing
antibodies age 6 months 22% least one rhinovirus episode
indicated virus detection. age 2 years, 91.3% children had
rhinovirus-specific antibodies, 79% children experienced
rhinovirus infection judged virus detection tests. however, the
complement-fixation assay poor diagnostic test. 458 acute otitis
media episodes studied, 41% shown associated rhinovirus by
rt-pcr-hybridization, significant fourfold rise rhinoviral antibodies
was detected 7% cases.
