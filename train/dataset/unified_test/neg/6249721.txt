two cell cultures obtained excised tumors two cases infantile
digital fibromatosis (idf). cells eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion
bodies characteristic idf. although rate cells bearing inclusion
bodies high earlier passage levels, reduced zero 15th
passage one cultures, cells culture continued to
produce inclusion bodies even 30th passage. chromosome analysis
revealed cultures tetraploid cells approximately 8 12% late
passage levels. viruslike particles found electron microscopy. no
tumors developed cells inoculated athymic, nude mice
subcutaneously. cell cultures valuable characterizing the
eosinophilic inclusion bodies determining origin tumors.
