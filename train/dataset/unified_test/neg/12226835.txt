type 1, 2, 3 vaccine-derived polioviruses isolated sewage
disposal plant located downstream oyabe river toyama prefecture, japan,
between october 1993 september 1995. neurovirulence analyzed 13 type 1
vaccine-derived strains, using mutant analysis polymerase chain reaction and
restriction enzyme cleavage (maprec). nine strains (69%) estimated have
marked neurovirulence. neutralizing antigenic sites, temperature
sensitivity, plaque-forming ability two virulent vaccine-derived
poliovirus strains similar mahoney strain. neutralizing activity of
human sera obtained oral poliomyelitis vaccine (opv) administration against
one virulent vaccine-derived polioviruses examined. although human
sera showed sufficient neutralizing activity prevention poliomyelitis 
by vaccine-derived poliovirus strains, lower titer sabin type
1 strain observed. vaccination virulent vaccine-derived poliovirus
will effective. however, environmental presence viruses have
properties similar mahoney strain threat. introduction of
inactivated poliovirus vaccine (ipv), well-maintained herd immunity, together
with reinforced environmental surveillance important final phase of
the polio eradication program world health organization (who).
