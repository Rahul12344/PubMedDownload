herein, design, synthesis inhibitory potency series novel
hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns3 protease inhibitors presented. inhibitors
are based 2(1h)-pyrazinone p3 scaffold combination either p2
phenylglycine glycine, evaluated wild type well as
on two resistant variants enzyme, a156t d168v. molecular modelling
suggested aromatic side-chain p2 phenylglycine occupies 
space substituent position 6 pyrazinone core. versatile
synthetic route applied pyrazinone synthesis made switch the
two positions easily feasible, resulting phenyl- benzyl substituted
pyrazinones leaving glycine p2 residue. several p1-p1' residues
evaluated, aromatic p1-p1' scaffold found superior combination the
new p3-p2 building block. result, entirely new type achiral and
rigidified inhibitors discovered, best novel inhibitors
having fourfold improved potency compared corresponding tripeptide lead.
we consider achiral inhibitors highly suitable starting points for
further optimization.
