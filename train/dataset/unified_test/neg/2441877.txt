the primary event infection cells hiv interaction the
viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, cellular receptor, cd4. recombinant
form gp120 found bind recombinant cd4 antigen high affinity. 
two gp120-specific murine monoclonal antibodies able block the
interaction gp120 cd4. gp120 epitope one antibodies
was isolated immunoaffinity chromatography acid-cleaved gp120 shown 
be contained within amino acids 397-439. using vitro mutagenesis, have
found deletion 12 amino acids region gp120 leads a
complete loss binding. addition, single amino acid substitution this
region results significantly decreased binding, suggesting sequences
within region directly involved binding gp120 cd4
receptor.
