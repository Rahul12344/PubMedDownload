background aims: thrombomodulin (tm), lectin-like domain (tmd1), 
sequesters proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) prevent from
engaging receptor advanced glycation end product (rage) sustains
inflammation tissue damage. previous study demonstrated short-term
treatment recombinant tm containing extracellular domains (i.e.,
rtmd123) inhibits hmgb1-rage signaling confers protection against
cacl2-induced aaa formation. study, attempted optimize tm
domains, potential therapeutic agent aaa, using recombinant
adeno-associated virus (aav) vector.
methods: therapeutic effects recombinant tmd1 (rtmd1) recombinant aav 
vectors carrying lectin-like domain tm (raav-tmd1) evaluated the
cacl2-induced aaa model angiotensin ii-infused aaa model, respectively.
results: cacl2-induced model, treatment rtmd1 suppressed tissue
levels hmgb1 rage, macrophage accumulation, elastin destruction aaa
formation, effects comparable mole-equivalent dosage of
rtmd123. angiotensin ii-infused model, single intravenous injection of
raav-tmd1 (1011 genome copies), resulted persistently high serum level
of tmd1 least 12 weeks, effectively attenuated aaa formation with
suppression hmgb1 rage levels inhibition proinflammatory cytokine
production, macrophage accumulation, matrix metalloproteinase activities and
oxidative stress aortic wall.
conclusions: findings corroborate therapeutic potential tm
lectin-like domain aaa. attenuation angiotensin ii-infused aaa by
one-time delivery raav-tmd1 provides proof-of-concept validation its
application potential gene therapy aneurysm development.
