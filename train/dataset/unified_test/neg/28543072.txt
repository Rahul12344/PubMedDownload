squamous cell carcinoma completed 3-night home sleep test (hst), epworth
sleepiness scale, functional outcomes sleep questionnaire, university of
washington quality life questionnaire. exclusion criteria included oncologic
surgical procedures, active disease, history tracheotomy, history osa, or
completion radiation therapy within last 3 months.
results: sixteen hnscc patients completed hst, 50% (8) demonstrating
objective evidence osa ranging mild severe (range 5.6-38.8, median
13.9). median age 61.6 years, median body mass index (bmi) 29.8,
and 13 subjects male. differences age, bmi, median
radiation dose, tumor primary site stage, human papilloma virus status, or
comorbidity status osa non-osa groups. self-reported
questionnaire scores different two groups. osa patients a
nonsignificant shorter time interval completion radiation 
hst date (1.8 vs. 3.4 years, p = 0.065) higher rate gastrostomy tube
placement radiation (62.5% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.059).
conclusion: results preliminary study suggest prevalence 
osa increased head neck irradiated patient compared the
general population. self-report sleep symptoms alone may unreliable to
determine risk osa hnscc population.
