objectives: nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation associated
with tumorigenic growth hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx)-transformed
cells. study aimed find key target treatment hbx-mediated
cancers.
materials methods: nf-kappab activation, endoplasmic reticulum-stress
(er-stress), caspase-3 activation, cell proliferation evaluated after
chang/hbx cells permanently expressing hbx viral protein treated with
inhibitors nf-kappab, proteasome dna topoisomerase.
results: inhibition nf-kappab transcriptional activity transient
transfection mutant plasmids encoding akt1 glycogen synthase
kinase-3beta (gsk-3beta), treatment chemical inhibitors, wortmannin
and ly294002, showed little effect survival chang/hbx cells.
furthermore, ikappabalpha (s32/36a) mutant plasmid nf-kappab inhibitors,
1-pyrrolidinecarbonidithioic acid sulphasalazine, also shown have
little effect cell proliferation. contrast, proteasome inhibitor-1
(pro1) mg132 enhanced hbx-induced er-stress response subsequent
activation caspase-12, -9 -3 reduced cell proliferation. camptothecin 
(cpt), however, triggered activation caspase-3 without induction of
caspase-12, reduced cell proliferation. addition, cpt-induced cell death
was reversed pre-treatment z-devd, caspase-3-specific inhibitor.
conclusions: detailed exploitation regulators caspase-3 activation
could open gate finding efficient target development anticancer
therapeutics hbx-transformed hepatocellular carcinoma.
