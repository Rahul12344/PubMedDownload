some biological characteristics bioassay polyhedral virus isolated 
normal-appearing strain hb-301 entamoeba histolytica described. virus 
produced lysis susceptible strains e. histolytica, yet caused no
cytopathological effect host strain, hb-301. virus host amoeba
existed equilibrium; approximately 10(4) mean infective dose units virus
were produced per million hb-301 amoebae. superinfection antiviral antiserum 
treatment failed disturb equilibrium permanently. mechanism viral 
persistence strain hb-301 amoebae remains determined. purification of
the virus attempted. ninety-nine percent viral infectivity was
associated low-speed pellet consisted complexes virus and
cellular membranes. various treatments low-speed pellet failed release
virus. biologically active, membrane-free virus low titer prepared by
differential centrifugation supernatant solutions employed electron
microscopy studies.
