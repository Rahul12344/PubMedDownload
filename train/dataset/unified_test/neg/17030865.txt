duck hepatitis virus type 1 (dhv-1) previously classified enterovirus, 
based primarily observed morphology physicochemical properties the
virion. complete nucleotide sequences two strains (drl-62 r85952) of
dhv-1 determined. excluding poly(a) tail, genomes 7691 
7690 nt, respectively, contain single, large open reading frame encoding 
polyprotein 2249 aa. genome dhv-1 organized members 
of family picornaviridae: 5' untranslated region
(utr)-vp0-vp3-vp1-2a1-2a2-2b-2c-3a-3b-3c-3d-3' utr. analysis genomic and
predicted polyprotein sequences revealed several unusual features, including 
absence predicted maturation cleavage vp0, presence two unrelated 
2a protein motifs 3' utr extended markedly compared 
picornavirus. 2a1 protein motif related 2a protein type the
genus aphthovirus adjacent 2a2 protein related 2a protein type 
present genus parechovirus. phylogenetic analysis using 3d protein
sequence shows two dhv-1 strains related closely members 
the genus parechovirus picornaviruses. however, two dhv-1
strains form monophyletic group, clearly distinct members genus
parechovirus.
