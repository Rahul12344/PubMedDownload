background: vast majority studies aimed detecting human papillomavirus 
(hpv) dna skin cancer used sensitive polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
methods pcr technique, despite high sensitivity, suitable to
ascertain whether (i) presence hpv related cells
harbouring virus, (ii) presence hpv due tumour surface
contamination (iii) presence hpv localized cancer cells, rather 
than normal keratinocytes present tumour biopsy. recent work we
have found mucosal high-risk (hr) hpv genotypes primary melanoma pcr.
objectives: localize mucosal hr-hpv nucleic acids tumoural melanocytic
marker sections primary melanoma samples order understand
the relationship hpvs melanoma cells.
methods: developed sensitive method combines an
enzyme-amplified fluorescent situ hybridization (ish) detection hpv
nucleic acids (types 16 18) chemiluminescent immunohistochemistry
(ihc) method detection tumoural melanocytic marker hmb-45
sequentially section. digital images fluorescent ish and
chemiluminescent ihc separately recorded, assigned different colours and
merged using specific software image analysis.
results: combined fluorescent ish chemiluminescent ihc demonstrated a
sharp colocalization (in range 60-80%) hpv nucleic acids melanoma
marker inside sections melanoma biopsies, strong specificity
and sensitivity.
conclusions: strong colocalization mucosal hr-hpv nucleic acids hmb-45
melanocytic marker emphasized viral nucleic acids specifically present 
in melanoma cells supported possible active role hpv malignant
melanoma.
