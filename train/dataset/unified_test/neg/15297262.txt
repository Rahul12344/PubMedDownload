bile salts predominantly taken hepatocytes via basolateral
na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (ntcp/slc10a1) secreted into
the bile bile salt export pump (bsep/abcb11). present study, we
transfected rat ntcp rat bsep polarized madin-darby canine kidney cells 
and characterized transport properties cells eight bile salts.
immunohistochemical staining demonstrated ntcp expressed the
basolateral domains, whereas bsep expressed apical domains.
basal-to-apical transport taurocholate across monolayer expressing only
ntcp coexpressing ntcp/bsep observed, whereas flux across the
monolayer control bsep-expressing cells symmetrical. basal-to-apical
transport taurocholate across ntcp/bsep-coexpressing monolayers was
significantly higher across monolayers expressing ntcp. kinetic
analysis vectorial transport taurocholate gave apparent k(m) value 
of 13.9 +/- 4.7 microm cells expressing ntcp alone, comparable 
22.2 +/- 4.5 microm cells expressing ntcp bsep v(max) values 
15.8 +/- 4.2 60.8 +/- 9.0 pmol.min(-1).mg protein(-1) ntcp alone ntcp
and bsep-coexpressing cells, respectively. transcellular transport cholate,
glycocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, glycochenodeoxycholate, 
tauroursodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, glycoursodeoxycholate, 
of lithocholate also observed across double transfectant. this
double-expressing system used model clarify vectorial transport of
bile salts across hepatocytes physiological conditions.
