latent state sensory neurons noncoding (e.g., latency-associated
transcript) micro-rnas expressed. productive infection, viral genes
must sequentially derepressed two checkpoints. leading role the
repression viral genes carried histone deacetylase
(hdac)/corepressor element-1 silencing transcription factor
(corest)/lysinespecific demethylase1(lsd1)/re1-silencing transcription factor
(rest) repressor complex (hclr). previously, reported define role 
of components hclr complex establishment latency, we
constructed recombinant virus (r112) carrying dominant-negative rest bound
response elements dna could recruit repressive proteins. this
recombinant virus unable establish latency. current studies, we
constructed virus (r111) carrying wt rest wt genome. report the
following findings: (a) r111 readily established latent infection trigeminal
ganglia; however, although amounts viral dnas latently infected neurons
were similar wt virus, levels latency-associated transcript
and micro-rnas 50- 100-fold lower; (b) r111 spontaneously
reactivate ganglionic organ cultures; however, viral genes expressed if
the synthesis rest blocked cycloheximide; (c) histone deacetylase
inhibitors reactivated wt parent r111 recombinant virus. the
results suggest rest plays transient role establishment latency 
but reactivation suggest existence least two phases 
establishment reactivation.
