the fhua receptor protein involved energy-coupled transport fe3+ via
ferrichrome outer membrane escherichia coli. since energy
source known outer membrane assumed energy provided
through action tonb, exbb exbd proteins, anchored the
cytoplasmic membrane. deleting 34 amino acid residues putative cell
surface exposed loop, fhua converted ligand specific transport protein
into tonb independent nonspecific diffusion channel. fhua deletion
derivative fhua delta 322-355 formed stable channels black lipid membranes, in
contrast wild-type fhua increase membrane conductance. the
single-channel conductance fhua mutant channels least three times
larger general diffusion porins e. coli outer membrane. is
proposed basic structure fhua outer membrane channel
formed beta-barrels. since loop extending residue 316 356 part 
of active site fhua, probably controls permeability channel.
the transport-active conformation fhua mediated tonb-induced
conformational change response energized cytoplasmic membrane. the
ferrichrome transport rate cells expressing fhua delta 322-355 increased
linearly increasing substrate concentration (from 0.5 20 microm), in
contrast fhua wild-type cells, displayed saturation 5 microm. this
implies wild-type cells ferrichrome transport outer membrane 
is rate-limiting step tonb, exbb exbd required for
outer membrane transport.
