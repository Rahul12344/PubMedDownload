in recent years, unexpected outbreaks infectious diseases caused emerging
and re-emerging viruses become frequent, possibly due to
environmental changes. outbreaks result loss life economic
hardship. vaccines therapeutics developed prevention and
treatment infectious diseases. review, summarize discuss the
latest progress development small-molecule viral inhibitors against
highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, ebola virus, and
zika virus. viruses interfere specific steps viral life
cycle blocking binding virus host cells, disrupting viral
endocytosis, disturbing membrane fusion, interrupting viral rna replication
and translation, thereby demonstrating potent therapeutic effect various 
emerging re-emerging viruses. also discuss general strategies for
developing small-molecule viral inhibitors.
