virulent avian influenza viruses produce lethal disease chickens. since cell
death caused either necrosis apoptosis, investigated types of
cell death occur natural hosts, chickens, infected virulent avian
viruses. using biochemical methods, demonstrate virulent avian influenza 
viruses induce apoptosis vascular endothelial cells liver, kidney, and
brain. viral antigens also detected organs, suggesting viral
replication induces apoptosis infected chickens. results indicate that
apoptosis occur virulent avian influenza virus infection natural
host, may contribute lethality virus.
