objective: analyze clinical characteristics severely critically ill
children 2009 influenza (h1n1) infection.
method: clinical data 150 cases 2009 influenza (h1n1) virus infection
confirmed use real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay on
nasopharyngeal swab specimens analyzed.
result: among 150 severely critically ill children 2009 influenza a
(h1n1) virus infection, 103 male, 47 female; median age 5
years, 81(55%) 5 years age older; 21 (14%) underlying chronic
diseases. common presenting symptoms fever (95%), cough (89%),
vomiting (23%), wheezing (19%), abdominal pain (16%), lethargy (7%), seizures
(6%), myalgia (6%), diarrhea (6%). common laboratory abnormalities were
increased decreased white blood cells counts (40%), elevated crp (33%), ldh
(29%), ck (25%) ast (19%). clinical complications included pneumonia (65%),
encephalopathy (12%), myocarditis (5%), encephalitis (1%) myositis (1%). 
patients received antibiotics admission admission; 73% of
patients received oseltamivir treatment, 23% patients received
corticosteroids; 32 (21%) admitted icu, 13 patients intubated and
mechanically ventilated. fourteen patients dyspnea irresponsive 
the treatment experienced bronchoalveolar lavage flexible bronchoscopy, 
the branching bronchial casts removed 5 patients. totally 145 (97%)
patients discharged, five (3%) died, three previously healthy patients died 
from severe encephalopathy, one patient died ards, one previously healthy
patient died secondary fungal meningitis.
conclusion: severely critically ill children 2009 influenza (h1n1)
virus infection may occur mainly older children without underlying chronic
disease. clinical spectrum laboratory abnormality patients can
have wide range. neurologic complications may common severe
encephalopathy lead death previously healthy children. early use of
bronchoalveolar lavage flexible bronchoscopy may reduce death associated
with pulmonary complications.
