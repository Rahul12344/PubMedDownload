background: directly administered antiretroviral therapy (daart) promising
intervention improving hiv outcomes among active drug users, elements
associated successful daart programs remain largely unknown. study
aimed assess impact colocated medical, case management, referral to
substance abuse services (daart-plus) among subjects receiving daart part 
of larger randomized controlled trial comparing daart self-administered
therapy.
methods: health services utilization 72 subjects receiving daart was
analyzed impact changes hiv-1 rna levels 6 months. primary
outcome virologic success, defined achieving hiv-1 rna level </=400
copies/ml >/=1.0 log10 reduction hiv-1 rna level. second analysis
consisted linear regression assessing effect covariates log10 hiv-1 
rna reduction baseline 6 months.
results: multivariate analyses, achieving virologic success 6 months was
associated high medical services utilization [adjusted odds ratio [aor] =
10.0 (1.4, 73.9); p = 0.02] use case management services [aor =
5.8 (1.1, 30.5); p = 0.04]. services resulted larger reduction log10
hiv-1 rna baseline (difference slopes: -0.9 -1.0, respectively; p =
0.02 both). referral off-site substance abuse services treatment not
significantly predict either virologic outcome.
conclusions: among individuals receive daart, utilization on-site
medical case management services independently associated improved
virologic outcomes. results suggest potential utility integrating
these services daart interventions (daart-plus) targeting hiv-infected drug 
users problematic adherence.
