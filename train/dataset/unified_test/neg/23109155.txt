objective: microvesicles (mvs) indicated important mediators of
intercellular communication emerging new biomarkers tissue damage. 
our previous data indicate reactive microglia/macrophages release mvs in
vitro. aim study evaluate whether mvs released by
microglia/macrophages vivo whether number varies brain
inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis (ms).
methods: electron fluorescence microscopy flow cytometry used to
detect myeloid mvs cerebrospinal fluid (csf) healthy controls, ms
patients, rodents affected experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(eae), animal model ms.
results: myeloid mvs detected csf healthy controls. relapsing and
remitting eae mice, concentration myeloid mvs csf significantly
increased closely associated disease course. analysis mvs csf 
of 28 relapsing patients 28 patients clinical isolated syndrome 2
independent cohorts revealed higher levels myeloid mvs 13 age-matched 
controls, indicating clinical value mvs companion tool capture
disease activity. myeloid mvs found spread inflammatory signals in
vitro vivo site administration; mice impaired mv shedding
were protected eae, suggesting pathogenic role mvs disease.
finally, fty720, first approved oral ms drug, significantly reduced the
amount mvs csf eae-treated mice.
interpretation: findings identify myeloid mvs marker therapeutic
target brain inflammation.
