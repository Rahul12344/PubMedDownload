in study attempted investigate feasibility transferring
exogenous dna recipient host via polyomavirus major capsid protein vp(1)
pseudocapsids generated recombinant escherichia coli, designated pyvp(1,e), 
both vitro vivo. nih-3t3 fr3t3 cells transfected pcmv
beta ppymt-1 plasmid dna, respectively. vitro dna transfection carried
out via pseudofect- pyvp(1,e)-mediated methods, co-precipitation with
calcium phosphate. expression beta-galactosidase pymt reporter genes was
examined western-blot analysis. parallel experiments performed vivo by
direct injection pcmv beta ppymt-1 plasmid dna, complexed pyvp(1,e), 
into livers wistar rats, followed western-blot analysis and
histochemical staining. results obtained vitro transfection
experiments showed expression reporter genes detected the
recipient cells 48 h post-transfection. pyvp(1,e) shown exhibit
similarly efficient vitro dna transfection properties pseudofect, was
obtained recombinant baculovirus.
