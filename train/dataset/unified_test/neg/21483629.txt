aim: determine effect legalon-sil (ls) hepatitis c virus (hcv) core 
and ns5a expression heme oxygenase-1 (hmox-1) transcriptional
regulators human hepatoma cells expressing full length hcv genotype 1b.
methods: con1 cells treated 50 μmol/l 200 μmol/l ls. cells were
harvested 2, 6 24 h. hcv rna protein levels determined by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction western blotting,
respectively.
results: hcv rna (core ns5a regions) decreased 6 h ls 200
μmol/l (p < 0.05). 50 200 μmol/l ls decreased hcv rna levels [core
region (by 55% 88%, respectively) ns5a region (by 62% 87%,
respectively) 24 h compared vehicle (dimethyl sulphoxide) control (p <
0.01). similarly hcv core ns5a protein decreased (by 85%, p < 0.01 and
by 65%, p < 0.05, respectively) ls 200 μmol/l. bach1 hmox-1 rna also 
downregulated ls treatment (p < 0.01), nrf2 protein increased (p <
0.05).
conclusion: results demonstrate treatment ls downregulates hcv core
and ns5a expression con1 cells express full length hcv genotype 1b, 
suggests ls may prove valuable alternative adjunctive therapy for
the treatment hcv infection.
