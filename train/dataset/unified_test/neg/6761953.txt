rabbits hyperimmunized inactivated malignant catarrhal fever virus (mcfv)
infected rabbit lymph node cells develop specific antibodies virus
and succumbed challenge live mcfv-infected lymphoid cells. rabbits
hyperimmunized either inactivated live, cultured bovine kidney cells
infected mcfv developed antibodies virus, also succumbed to
challenge live mcfv-infected rabbit lymphoid cells. rabbits hyperimmunized
with live cultured rabbit kidney cells infected mcfv developed antibodies to
the virus resisted challenge live mcfv-infected rabbit lymphoid tissues 
47 weeks later. however, rechallenge group 90 weeks post immunization 
resulted death 2/4 rabbits suggesting waning immunity.
