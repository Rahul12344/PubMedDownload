high-dose recombinant human growth hormone (rhgh) (2-6 mg/day) regimes may
facilitate t-cell restoration patients infected human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv) highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). however, high-dose
rhgh regimens increase insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) to
supra-physiological levels associated severe side effects. present study
investigated whether lower doses rhgh may improve t-cell restoration in
patients infected hiv following expedient response total bioactive
(i.e., free) igf-i. previous 16-week pilot-study included six hiv-infected
patients stable haart receive rhgh 0.7 mg/day, increased total
(+117%, p < 0.01) free (+155%, p < 0.01) igf-i levels. study extended
to examine whether continuous use low-dose rhgh (0.7 mg/day week 60; 0.4
mg/day week 60 week 140) would maintain expedient igf-i levels and
improve cd4 t-cell response. total free igf-i increased week 36 (+97%, p <
0.01 +125%, p < 0.01, respectively) week 60 (+77%, p = 0.01 +125%, p 
< 0.01) compared baseline levels (161 +/- 15 0.75 +/- 0.11 microg/l). cd4 
t-cell number increased week 36 (+15%, p < 0.05) week 60 (+31%, p = 0.01) 
compared baseline levels (456 +/- 55 cells/microl). following rhgh dose
reduction, total igf-i cd4 t-cell number remained increased week 88 (+44%,
p = 0.01 +33%, p < 0.01) week 140 (+46%, p = 0.07 +36%, p = 0.02)
compared baseline levels. data support notion low-dose rhgh
regimens may increase expediently total bioactive igf-i improve t-cell
restoration patients infected hiv haart.
