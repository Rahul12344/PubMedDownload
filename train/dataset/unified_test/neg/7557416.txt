dna coding bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase (t7-rnap) inserted a
positive selection-vector form t4 genome, placing control 
bacteriophage t4 ipiii promoters. recombinant t4::t7-rnap fusion phage
retained infectivity produced t7-rnap infected cells. fusion genes were
constructed insertion plasmid containing ipiii (encoding internal
protein iii) target portion bacteriophage t7 promoter region. when
escherichia coli cells containing plasmid infected t4::t7-rnap 
re-phage, bacteria produced fusion protein high levels. newly
synthesized t4::t7-rnap re-phage progeny package process fusion protein
into phage capsid head morphogenesis. paper, demonstrate
that truncated t4 internal protein ipiii, human ipiii::beta glo (beta-globin)
fusion protein, e. coli ipiii::beta glo::beta gal (beta-galactosidase)
triple-fusion protein ipiii::v3 fusion protein (human immunodeficiency virus 
envelope protein gp120 v3 region) expressed high levels t4::t7-rnap
induction. ipiii::beta glo, expression-packaging-processing (epp) occurs
simultaneously t4::t7-rnap re-phage infection. also demonstrate that
t4::t7-rnap re-phage stabilize unstable proteins x90 fragment beta
gal, thought degraded lon protease. unstable 20-kda fragment of
the large subunit human cytochrome b558, integral membrane protein in
phagocytes, subject proteolytic degradation even produced the
lon-deficient bl21 strain. however, upon induction t4::t7-rnap re-phage, the
20-kda protein produced intact.(abstract truncated 250 words)
