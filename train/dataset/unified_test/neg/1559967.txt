modification, myristoyl-coa-protein n-myristoyltransferase (nmt), been
identified potential target antiviral antifungal therapy. its
reaction mechanism ordered bi bi myristoyl-coa binding occurring before
binding peptide coa release preceding release myristoylpeptide.
perturbations binding acyl-coa substrate would therefore be
expected important influence catalysis. synthesized 56
analogs myristic acid (c14:0) characterize acyl-coa binding

assessed using coupled vitro assay system employed reportedly
nonspecific pseudomonas acyl-coa synthetase, purified s. cerevisiae nmt, and
octapeptide substrates derived residues 2-9 catalytic subunit of
cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase pr55gag polyprotein precursor of
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-i). analysis ketocarbonyl-, ester-, and
amide-containing myristic acid analogs (the latter two isomeric arrangements, 
the acylamino acid (-co-nh-) amide (-nh-co)) indicated enzyme's 
binding site able accommodate dipolar protrusion c4 c13.
this includes region acyl chain occurring near c5-c6 (numbered from
carboxyl) appears bound bent conformation 140-150 degrees. the
activities nmt's acyl-coa substrates decrease increasing polarity. this
relationship particularly apparent analysis series analogs in
which hydrocarbon chain terminated (i) azido group (ii) one of
three nitrogen heterocycles (imidazole, triazole, tetrazole) alkylated at
either nitrogen carbon. inverse relationship polarity and

analog series surveyed determine whether could inhibit replication

most active analog tested, producing 60-90% inhibition viral production in
