the mechanisms regulate ionic balance, fluid absorption secretion the
gastrointestinal tract complex. disturbance homeostatic state bile
acids, bacterial enterotoxins neoplasm-derived secretagogues, example,
can lead diarrhea. determining causes chronic diarrhea individual
patients may, therefore, represent diagnostic challenge. gastrointestinal
tract finely tuned mechanisms maintain ionic balance, fluid absorption and
secretion. achieve homeostasis, various ionic transport
proteins/complexes targeted apical, basal basolateral membranes 
epithelial cells. na, k cl ion transport proteins regulated endogenous
activators (e.g. camp, pge2, ca), dietary-related factors (e.g. bile acids) and
through post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). certain
pathophysiologic states, homeostatic ionic/fluid exchange becomes
dysfunctional result failure compensatory

if ameliorated. diverse infectious organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoa,
viruses) utilize different mechanisms cause intestinal disease diarrhea.
these pathophysiologic mechanisms include alterations ion transport,
disruption tight junctions elicitation inflammatory responses. studies 
of patients infected certain pathogens, ulcerative colitis and
those harboring extra-colonic colonic neoplasms elucidated 
pathophysiologic mechanisms diarrhea. determining etiology chronic
diarrhea specific cases may diagnostic challenge both
