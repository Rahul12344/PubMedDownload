objective: specific 30-bp deletion epstein-barr virus (ebv)-derived
latent membrane protein-1 gene suggested associated the
pathogenesis nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) aggressive phenotype of
some ebv-associated malignancies.
methods: authors conducted retrospective cohort study. 1995 and
2001, 542 patients received complete courses radiotherapy followed 
at least 3 years follow enrolled. patients divided two
groups according presence absence 30-bp deletion tumor 
samples.
results: total 446 (82.3%) patients found feature 30-bp
deletion, whereas 88 (16.2%) not. interestingly, dual infection found 
eight (1.5%) patients. statistical significance found age, gender,
npc-presenting stage, radiosensitivity, pathologic classification the
two groups. actuarial 5-year overall survival rate distant
metastasis-free rate 30-bp deletion nondeletion group not
statistically different (61.3% vs. 65.4% 68.1% vs. 73.1%; p = .132 .135, 
respectively). multivariate analysis, older age, nasopharyngeal recurrence,
advanced tumor stage, development distant metastasis shown 
poorer prognosticators overall survival, whereas presence 30-bp
deletion not. distant metastasis, advanced tumor stage shown 
be poor prognosticator, whereas variables, including presence of
30-bp deletion, statistical significance.
conclusions: retrospective cohort, demonstrated this
specific 30-bp sequence deletion might predominant variant rather
than npc phenotype-associated polymorphism. additionally, dual infection 
rare possible phenomenon endemic npc tumors.
