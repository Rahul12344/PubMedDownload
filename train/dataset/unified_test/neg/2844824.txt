igg subclasses varicella-zoster virus (vzv) detected plasma from
different sources used production varicella/zoster immunoglobulin
(vzig). igg1 igg3 principal virus antibodies plasma healthy 
donors well convalescents primary reactivated disease.
anti-vzv igg3 antibodies predominant among varicella convalescents while
igg1 antibodies dominated among zoster convalescents. igg4 antibodies were
present zoster convalescents healthy donors rarely detected in
varicella convalescents. antiviral igg2 antibodies found few
cases. studies plasma samples collected one varicella convalescent during
a period seven months following outbreak disease, demonstrated rapid
fall antiviral igg1 igg3, igg4 increased reach maximum six
months onset symptoms. relative distribution vzv-specific
subclasses plasma pool conserved fractionation procedure
combining polyethyleneglycol 6000 precipitation ion exchange chromatography,
thus suggesting protective efficacy maintained resulting
immunoglobin preparations.
