human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) virions contain heat shock proteins
(hsp), proteins received limited attention. objectives this
study establish microbial 70-kda hsp exerts inhibitory effect
on hiv-1 infection human cd4+ cells, identify inhibitory peptide
epitope within sequence hsp70, evaluate kinetic features any
inhibitory activity. results studies suggest microbial hsp70
exerts dose-dependent inhibition ccr5 (r5) strains clades b, c, of
hiv-1 infecting human cd4+ cells. site hiv-1-inhibitory function was
identified within c-terminal peptide binding domain hsp70, the
function expressed peptide epitope comprising amino acids 407 426.
the mechanism inhibition hiv-1 infectivity hsp70 blocking ccr5
coreceptors directly indirectly inducing cc chemokines apobec3g. the
inhibitory effect hsp70, c-terminal fragment, peptide 407-426 may make 
hsp70 useful microbicidal agent. potentiating noncognate inhibition of
hiv-1 infectivity combined treatment hsp70 monoclonal polyclonal
antibody ccr5 demonstrated. novel strategy may utilized in
therapeutic immunization hiv-1 infection.
