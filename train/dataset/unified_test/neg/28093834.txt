background objective: seasonal distribution microbial aetiology in
patients community-acquired pneumonia (cap) may add important information
both epidemiologists clinicians. investigate seasonal distribution
of microbial aetiology cap.
methods: prospective observational study carried hospital
clinic barcelona, spain (january 2003-december 2014).
results: studied 4431 patients cap, 2689 (61%) males.
microbial aetiology identified 1756 patients (40%). cap frequent 
in winter (34%) two-third patients cap presented seasons.
seasonal variations included streptococcus pneumoniae (winter 21% vs spring 17%
vs summer 14% vs autumn 13%, overall p < 0.001). influenza viruses most
prevalent autumn (6%) winter (5%) compared spring (3%) summer
(1%) (overall p < 0.001). legionella pneumophila frequent autumn (4%)
and summer (4%) compared spring (2%) winter (1%) (overall p < 0.001).
incidence polymicrobial pneumonia also differed seasons (winter 7% vs 
spring 5% vs summer 3% vs autumn 6%, overall p = 0.001). observed a
significant correlation lowest seasonal average temperature and
polymicrobial pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza viruses;
conversely, l. pneumophila common temperatures higher.
conclusion: cap regarded seasonal disease occurs
throughout seasons. however, s. pneumoniae, influenza viruses, polymicrobial 
pneumonia l. pneumophila clearly subject seasonal variations.
