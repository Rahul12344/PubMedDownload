two parvovirus b19 cdna libraries constructed; one cos-7 cells
transfected b19/psvod hybrid vector b19-infected human 
erythroid leukemic cells. used libraries investigate the
expression abundant classes polyadenylated b19 rnas; 700- and
800-nt class terminates middle genome 500- 600-nt
class contains orf extreme right-hand end genome. the
700- 800-nt rna species found cos cell library, suggesting
that variant polyadenylation signal (attaaa aataac) middle the
genome efficiently recognized cells. contrast, 700- and
800-nt class highly represented human library, confirming use of
this variant polyadenylation signal normal host cell virus. cos 
cells middle exon 500- 600-nt class rna exhibited variability
in splice donor acceptor sites. however, human cells 
two splice acceptor sites nt 1910 2030, single splice donor site nt
2183 exon. antisera, prepared peptide derived 94-aa
potential protein encoded 500- 600-nt class rna, recognized, a
western blot, polypeptide approximately 11 kda translated vitro 
from cdnas vivo psvod/b19 transfected cos cells.
immunoprecipitation revealed two proteins made orf,
suggesting use internal translation initiation site(s). another antisera, 
raised second peptide corresponding antigenic region the
potential protein encoded 700- 800-nt class rna, failed detect a
15-kda protein western blotting immunoprecipitation labeled proteins
both vitro vivo cos cells.
