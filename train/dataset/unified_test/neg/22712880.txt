background: onset pandemic h1n1/09 influenza outbreak in
australia, health authorities devised official clinical case definitions guide
testing access antiviral therapy.
objectives: assess diagnostic accuracy case definitions to
attempt improve using scoring system based clinical findings at
presentation.
patients/methods: study retrospective case-control study across three
metropolitan melbourne hospitals one associated community-based clinic during
the influenza season, 2009. patients presenting influenza-like illness who
were tested h1n1/09 influenza administered standard questionnaire of
symptomatology, comorbidities, risk factors. patients positive test
were compared negative test. logistic regression performed to
examine correlation clinical features disease. scoring system was
devised compared case definitions used pandemic. main
outcome measures positive negative predictive values scoring 
system, based real-life data, versus mandated case definitions'.
results: devised scoring system case definitions gave similar
positive predictive values (38-58% using ascending score groups, 39-44%
using various case definitions). negative predictive values also closely
matched (ranging 94% 73% respective score groups 83-84%
for case definitions).
conclusions: accurate clinical diagnosis h1n1/09 influenza difficult and
not improved significantly structured scoring system. investment more
widespread availability rapid sensitive diagnostic tests be
considered future pandemic planning.
