sera individuals infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and
hiv-related west african viruses mediate high-titered, virus-specific
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) stages infection. no
cross-reactive adcc detected hiv hiv-related west african
strains lav-2, htlv-iv, sbl-6669. two groups viruses have
antigenically distinct envelope glycoproteins, adcc-mediating antibodies most
likely directed envelope antigens. hiv-specific adcc, was
further confirmed using sera reacting hiv envelope negative for
antibodies viral core antigens.
