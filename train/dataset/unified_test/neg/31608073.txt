the central role cellular immune response control clearance 
the hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection well-established. contribution
of humoral immunity, including b cell antibody responses hbv, has
been investigated long time attracted increasing attention in
recent years. anti-hbs antibody first recognized marker of
protective immunity acute resolution hbv infection (or
vaccination) defined biomarker functional cure chronic
hepatitis b (chb). way, therapies targeting hbv-specific b cells 
induction anti-hbs antibody response essential elements rational
strategy terminate chronic hbv infection. however, high load hbsag the
blood, proposed induce antigen-specific immune tolerance,
represents major obstacle curing chb. long-term antiviral treatment by
nucleoside analogs, targeting viral translation sirna, inhibiting hbsag 
release via nucleic acid polymers, neutralizing hbsag via specific
antibodies could potentially reduce hbsag load chb patients. combined
strategy including reduction hbsag load via treatments the
therapeutic targeting b cells vaccination may induce appearance of
anti-hbs antibodies lead functional cure chb.
