enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaec) emerging enteric pathogen that
causes acute chronic diarrhea among children, human immunodeficiency
virus-infected patients, travelers developing regions world. the
pathogenesis eaec strains involves production biofilm. study,
we determined association presence putative eaec virulence genes
and biofilm formation 57 eaec isolates (as defined hep-2 adherence) from
travelers diarrhea 18 eaec isolates travelers without diarrhea. 
twelve nondiarrheagenic e. coli isolates healthy travelers used as
controls. biofilm formation measured using microtiter plate assay with
the crystal violet staining method, presence putative eaec
virulence genes aap, aata, aggr, asta, irp2, pet, set1a, shf determined
by pcr. eaec isolates likely produce biofilm nondiarrheagenic
e. coli isolates (p = 0.027), production biofilm associated with
the virulence genes aggr, set1a, aata, irp2, found 16 (40%), 17
(43%), 10 (25%), 27 (68%) biofilm producers versus 4 (11%), 6
(6%), 2 (6%), 15 (43%) non-biofilm producers (p = 0.008 aggr, p =
0.0004 set1a, p = 0.029 aata, p = 0.04 irp2). although the
proportion eaec isolates producing biofilm patients diarrhea (51%) was
similar patients without diarrhea (61%), biofilm production was
related carriage aggr (p = 0.015), set1a (p = 0.001), aata (p =
0.025). since aggr master regulator eaec, presence aap (p =
0.004), asta (p = 0.001), irp2 (p = 0.0006), pet (p = 0.002), set1a (p =
0.014) aggr versus aggr-lacking background investigated also
found associated biofilm production. study suggests biofilm 
formation common phenomenon among eaec isolates derived travelers 
or without diarrhea multiple genes associated biofilm formation are
regulated aggr.
