modification dna benzo[a]pyrene metabolite diol-epoxide
r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene.

the structural modification double-stranded circular dna simian virus 40
and plasmid cole1 vitro binding of
r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene studied.
stepwise hydrolysis endonuclease s1 dnase followed dna base analysis 
by thin-layer chromatography provided evidence binding adenine caused the
local denaturation dna, whereas 10-fold greater binding to
guanine create local denaturation. two synthetic
double-stranded polymers, poly(da-dt).poly(da-dt) poly(dg-dc).poly(dg-dc),
bound diol-epoxide, former showed marked hydrolysis after
endonuclease s1 treatment, whereas binding occurred 24-fold latter.
