using monoclonal antibodies raised faba bean necrotic yellows virus
(fbnyv) isolate egypt faba bean necrotic stunt virus (fbnsv) isolate
from ethiopia, striking serological variability among nanovirus isolates from
faba bean morocco revealed. obtain better understanding this
nanovirus variability morocco, entire genomes two serologically
contrasting isolates referred mor5 mor23 sequenced. eight
circular ssdna components, identified mor5- mor23-infected tissues 
and thought form complete nanovirus genome, ranged size 952 to
1,005 nt mor5 980 1,004 nt mor23 structurally
similar previously described nanovirus dnas. however, mor5 mor23 differed 
from overall nucleotide amino acid sequences 25 26%,
respectively. mor23 closely related typical fbnyv isolates described 
earlier egypt syria, shared mean amino acid sequence
identity 94%. hand, mor5 closely resembled fbnsv
isolate ethiopia, shared mean amino acid sequence identity
of approximately 89%. serological genetic differences observed mor5
and mor23 comparable observed earlier fbnyv, fbnsv, milk
vetch dwarf virus. following guidelines nanovirus species demarcation,
this suggests mor23 mor5 represent isolates fbnyv fbnsv,
respectively. first report presence fbnsv a
country ethiopia also occurrence complete genome
sequences members two nanovirus species country, thus providing
evidence faba bean crops infected members two distinct nanovirus 
species restricted geographic area.
