a small dna virus, named jc virus (jcv) belonging polyomaviridae, is
attracting attention anthropologists worldwide, jcv genotyping appears 
to novel means elucidating human migrations origins various
ethnic groups. basic properties jcv, regional distributions jcv
genotypes, phylogenetic relationships among various jcv genotypes are
described. then, study described origin modern japanese 
was extensively investigated using jcv genotyping method. based jcv
genotypes neighboring areas, origins people carried jcv genotypes
to japanese archipelago discussed. finally, relationships jcv
genotypes y-chromosome haplogroups examined, genetic variation 
y chromosome recently examined detail investigate ancient human
migrations population structures human groups.
