the feedback inhibition interleukin-6 (il-6) gene expression by
glucocorticoids represents regulatory link endocrine immune
systems. mechanism efficient repression il-6 promoter by
dexamethasone (dex) investigated hela cells transiently transfected with
plasmid constructs containing different il-6 promoter elements linked the
herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene (tk) promoter bacterial chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase gene (cat) cotransfected cdna vectors constitutively
expressing either active wild-type inactive mutant human glucocorticoid
receptor (gr). induction interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol
ester, forskolin il-6-tk-cat chimeric constructs containing single copy
of il-6 dna segment -173 -151 (mre i) -158 -145 (mre ii), 
which derive within multiple cytokine- second-messenger-responsive
enhancer (mre) region, strongly repressed dex wild-type gr-dependent 
fashion irrespective inducer used. induction pseudorabies virus 
an il-6 construct containing il-6 tata box rna start site
("initiator" inr element) mre region also repressed dex 
the presence wild-type gr. dnase footprinting showed purified
dna-binding fragment gr bound across mre, tata box, inr site
in il-6 promoter; footprint overlapped produced proteins present
in nuclear extracts uninduced induced hela cells. imperfect palindromic
nucleotide sequence motifs moderately related consensus gr-responsive
element (gre) motif present inr, tata box, mre ii site in
the il-6 promoter; although mre gr-binding site -201 -210 
il-6 lacked discernible inverted repeat motif, sequences showed
considerable similarity negative gre sequences dex-repressed genes.
surprisingly, chimeric genes containing mre ii, lacks recognizable
gacgtca cyclic amp- phorbol ester-responsive motif, strongly induced 
both phorbol ester forskolin, suggesting mre ii (acattgcacaatct) may 
the prototype novel cyclic amp- phorbol ester-responsive element. taken 
together, observations suggest ligand-activated gr represses il-6 
gene occlusion inducible il-6 mre enhancer region also 
the basal il-6 promoter elements.
