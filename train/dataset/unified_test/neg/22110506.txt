to establish persistent latent infection, epstein-barr virus (ebv) faces a
challenge virus-infected host cell must transit germinal 
centre reaction. site b cell differentiation antibody
responses optimised, selection criteria b cells stringent.
the germinal centre environment harsh, vast majority b cells here
die apoptosis. cells receiving adequate survival signals will
differentiate fully released periphery long-term memory b cells
(the site persistence). review, detail apoptotic pathways
potentially encountered ebv-infected b cells process infection, 
and describe functions ebv-regulated cellular viral genes
that help promote survival host b cell.
