the humikbeta(1), humanized igg1 monoclonal antibody directed toward the
il-2/il-15 receptor beta-chain (cd122), inhibits actions inflammatory 
cytokine il-15, may useful immunotherapy array autoimmune
disorders well diseases associated retrovirus human t-cell
lymphotrophic virus 1 (htlv-1). order facilitate production material
for clinical investigation, developed cell-based elisa (cbelisa) for
measuring binding activity, potential biological activity marker, the
humikbeta(1) monoclonal antibody transfected 32d mouse cell line (32dbeta)
expressing il-2rbeta antigen cell surface. specific binding of
humikbeta(1) transfected cell line, titrating concentration
range 1-1,000 ng/ml. identical conditions, binding of
humikbeta(1) parent cell line 32d. satisfactory binding curves with
humikbeta(1) obtained 32dbeta cells grown 3 19 passages 
culture seed densities 2 x 10(5)-4 x 10(6) cells/well. binding 
specific mikbeta antibodies recognizing il-2/il-15 receptor beta subunit 
as demonstrated binding humikbeta(1), mikbeta(2) mikbeta(3) antibodies,
and lack binding irrelevant humanized chimeric antibodies and
isotype-matched human igg1 32dbeta cell. also, human igg1 and
irrelevant humanized chimeric antibodies interfere the
humikbeta(1) binding. assay could detect changes binding activity of
humikbeta(1) antibody stressful conditions (heat low ph) the
results paralleled effect stress physicochemical characteristics.
more importantly, binding activity shows apparent correlation to
inhibition il-15-induced proliferation 32dbeta cells humikbeta(1). 
conclusion, cell-based elisa method represents simple, reproducible
accurate quantitative assay monitoring humikbeta(1) activity could be
used potency marker assay monitoring lot-lot consistency and
functional stability humikbeta(1) product.
