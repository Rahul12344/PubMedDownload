infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) exposure dietary aflatoxin b-1
(afb(1)) implicated epidemiological studies important
risk factors development hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). ability to
derive transgenic mice develop liver cancer consequence the
expression single gene hbv, hbx gene, provides opportunity to
use animal model test whether afb(1) induce p53 mutations,
particularly codon 249, frequently detected hcc and, result,
act synergistically hbv accelerate manifestation disease. while
afb(1) significantly shortened latency tumor development hbx
transgenic mice, tumors p53 mutations. tumors the
untreated transgenic mice, p53 tumor suppressor protein found bound the
hbx protein sequestered cytoplasmic compartment tumor cell.
despite frequent involvement ras mutations mouse tumors, also have
not detected activation ms p21 protein tumors the
afb(1)-treated mice. conclude although afb(1) act co-factor with
hbx induce hcc mice, mode action vivo remains obscure.
