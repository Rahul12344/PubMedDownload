the membrane glycoproteins g1 g2 members bunyaviridae family
are synthesized precursor single open reading frame. here, have
analyzed processing membrane insertion g1 g2 member the
phlebovirus genus, uukuniemi virus. expressing c-terminally truncated forms of
the p10 precursor containing whole g1 decreasing portions g2, we
found processing bhk21 cells occurred efficiency 50% 
g1 followed 50 residues g2, complete processing occurred 98,
150, 200 residues g2 present. surprisingly, processing all
truncated g2 forms less efficient hela cells. proteinase k treatment of
microsomes isolated infected cells indicated c terminus g1 is
exposed cytoplasmic face. using g1 tail peptide antisera, tail was
likewise found immunofluorescence exposed cytoplasmic face in
streptolysin o-permeabilized cells. introducing stop codons various
positions g1 tail natural cleavage site g1 g2 and
expressing mutants bhk cells, found processing the
g1 c terminus occurred following cleavage g2 signal peptidase. was
also supported finding antiserum raised peptide
corresponding region immediately upstream g2 signal sequence
reacted immunoblotting g1 virions. finally, show g1 and
g2 palmitylated. taken together, results show processing p10 of
uukuniemi virus occurs cotranslationally one site, i.e., downstream of
the internal g2 signal sequence. g1 g2 inserted type proteins into
the lipid bilayer, leaving g1 tail exposed cytoplasmic face the
membrane. since g2 tail 5 residues long, g1 tail likely 
responsible interaction nucleoproteins budding
process, addition harboring golgi localization signal.
