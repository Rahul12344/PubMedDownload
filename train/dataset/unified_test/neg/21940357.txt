background/aims: identify risk factors postoperative ascites after
hepatectomy patients hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) hepatitis b
virus associated-cirrhosis.
methodology: data 73 patients reviewed current study. pre- and
intra-operative variables retrospectively analyzed using uni- and
multi-variate analyses. diagnostic accuracy predictors evaluated
by receiver operating characteristics (roc) analysis.
results: indocyanine green retention rate 15 minutes (icgr15) >10%, tumor size
>10cm, splenectomy, middle hepatic vein (mhv) resection, red blood cell (rbc)
transfusion risk factors univariate analysis. however, icgr15 >10%, 
tumor size >10cm rbc transfusion showed prognostic power multivariate
analysis. roc analysis suggested best cut-off value risk factors 2.
conclusions: study indicated postoperative ascites could predicted 
pre- intra-operative variables. icgr15 >10%, tumor size >10cm rbc
transfusion independent risk factors ascites hepatectomy. patients
with two above-mentioned risk factors may suffer postoperative
ascites hepatectomy.
