replication bacteriophage m13 ix. requirement escherichia coli dnag
function m13 duplex dna replication.

ray ds, dueber j, suggs s.

temperature-shift experiments escherichia coli dnag strain indicate a
requirement dnag function m13 phage production early stage
of infection. mutant cells infected nonpermissive temperature form the
parental rf (ss leads rf) replicate further. shift to
nonpermissive temperature infection inhibits rf leads rf replication but
not rf leads ss synthesis. synthesis strands duplex rf 
inhibited equally temperature shift rf leads rf replication. we
infer dnag protein required m13 production rf
replication required synthesis strands rf.
