therefore, aim study assess prevalence associated
factors anemia among adult hiv positive patients anti-retroviral therapy at
deber tabor hospital, northwest ethiopia. institution based cross-sectional
study conducted 365 hiv/aids patients art selected using systematic
random sampling technique. blood samples analyzed using cell-dyn 1800
automated hematology analyzer measure hemoglobin. bivariable multivariable
binary logistic regression analyzes employed find predictors at
p-value < 0 .2 0.05, respectively.
results: overall prevalence anemia 34.0%[95% ci (29.0, 39.0)]; taking 
zidovudine based antiretroviral regimen (aor: 5.9, 95% ci 1.04, 13.86), cd4
count < 200 cells/mm3 (aor: 4.8 95%, ci 1.14, 12.42), inability read write
(aor: 3.2, 95% ci (1.24,8.40), inadequate dietary diversity (aor: 2.2, 95% ci
1.15, 4.26), female sex (aor: 1.9, 95% ci 1.06, 3.69) significantly
