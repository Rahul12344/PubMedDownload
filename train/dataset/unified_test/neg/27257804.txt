dengue used recognized imported sporadic disease china. since 
june 2014, unexpected large dengue outbreak attacked guangzhou, china,
resulting 40,000 cases. among 1,942 laboratory-confirmed
hospitalized dengue cases, 121 diagnosed severe dengue according the
2009 guideline, 2 patients finally died. laboratory diagnosis virus
isolation demonstrated majority (96%) cases caused dengue virus 
serotype 1 (denv-1), others serotype 2 (denv-2). 14 denv strains 
isolated sera acute-phase dengue patients outbreak, and
the complete envelope (e) gene 12 denv-1 strains two denv-2 strains were
determined using rt-pcr assay. phylogenetic analysis based e gene revealed
the denv-1 strains isolated outbreak belonged genotype v,
respectively. isolates formed three clades. denv-2 isolates assigned
to clade belonging genotype cosmopolitan. strains isolated in
2014 closely related isolates obtained province,
guangdong, 2013. amino acid mutations known increase virulence were
identified throughout e protein isolates 2014. results indicate
that dengue turning endemic guangdong, china, extensive
seroepidemiological investigation mosquito control measures critically
needed future.
