severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) infectious disease caused a
novel coronavirus cost nearly 800 lives. recent
outbreaks disease, threat remains sars coronavirus (sars-cov) like 
strains still exist animal reservoirs. therefore, development vaccine
against sars grave need. here, designed produced prototypic
sars vaccine: self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle repetitively
displays sars b-cell epitope c-terminal heptad repeat virus'
spike protein. biophysical analyses circular dichroism, transmission
electron microscopy dynamic light scattering confirmed computational
design showing alpha-helcial nanoparticles sizes 25 nm.
immunization experiments adjuvants performed balb/c mice. an
investigation binding properties elicited antibodies showed that
they highly conformation specific coiled-coil epitope they
specifically recognized native trimeric conformation c-terminal heptad
repeat region. consequently, antisera exhibited neutralization activity an
in vitro infection inhibition assay. conclude peptide nanoparticles
represent promising platform vaccine design, particular diseases
that characterized neutralizing epitopes coiled-coil conformation
such sars-cov enveloped viruses.
