the circulation migration leukocytes critical immune surveillance 
and immune response infection injury. key step leukocyte recruitment
involves adhesion immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) proteins on
endothelium integrin molecules leukocyte surfaces. igsf
members subverted virus receptors. four crystal structures n-terminal
two-domain fragments igsf proteins determined: intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), icam-2, vascular adhesion molecule-1 (vcam-1), 
mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (madcam-1). acidic residue near the
bottom domain 1 plays key role integrin binding. icam-1 icam-2,
this glutamic acid residue located flat surface, complementary the
flat surface domain integrin bind, lymphocyte
function-associated antigen-1 (lfa-1). vcam-1 madcam-1, acidic
residue aspartic acid, resides protruded cd loop may be
complementary pocket-like structure alpha 4 integrins which
they bind, lack domains. number unique structural features this
subclass igsf identified proposed consolidate the
domain structure resist force adhesion integrins. different
mechanisms proposed different cams present integrin-binding
surface toward opposing cell adhesion, prevent cis interaction with
integrins cell. finally, cd4 icam-1 compared context
of ligand binding virus binding, shows human immunodeficiency virus
and rhinovirus fit well distinct structural feature cognate
receptors.
