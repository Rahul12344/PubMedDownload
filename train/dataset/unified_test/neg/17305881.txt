we investigated overall site-specific prevalence pre-s mutations and
its clinical significance patients genotype c hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection. three hundred subjects included: 50 asymptomatic carriers (ac),
87 chronic hepatitis (ch), 91 liver cirrhosis (lc) 72 hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc). pre-s mutations determined nucleotide sequence analysis.
possible correlations pre-s mutations clinical/virological parameters
were examined. pre-s mutations detected 82 cases (27.3%); more
frequently found hcc (43.1%) lc (35.2%) group ch (20.7%) and
ac (2.0%) group. pre-s2 deletion commonly found mutation (10.7%),
followed pre-s2 start codon mutation (9.7%), pre-s1-s2 deletion (3.0%) and
both pre-s2 deletion start codon mutation (2.7%). pre-s2 deletion pre-s2 
start codon mutation frequently detected advanced diseases (lc and
hcc). pre-s mutations associated older age higher rates positive
hbv dna (>/=0.5 pg/ml). advanced disease positive hbv dna shown be
independent predictors pre-s mutations logistic regression analysis. 
findings suggest pre-s mutations, especially pre-s2 deletions pre-s2
start codon mutations, common patients genotype c hbv infection and
are associated advanced liver disease active viral replication.
