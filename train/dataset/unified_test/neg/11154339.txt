salicylic acid (sa) key endogenous component local systemic disease
resistance plants. study, investigated role benzoic acid
(ba) precursor sa biosynthesis tobacco (nicotiana tabacum cv samsun nn) 
plants undergoing hypersensitive response following infection tobacco
mosaic virus tobacco cell suspensions elicited beta-megaspermin, an
elicitor phytophthora megasperma. found small pool conjugated ba 
healthy leaves untreated cell suspensions tobacco, whereas free ba levels 
were barely detectable. infection plants tobacco mosaic virus or
elicitation cells led rapid de novo synthesis accumulation of
conjugated ba, whereas free ba weakly induced. presence diphenylene
iodonium, inhibitor superoxide anion formation, sa accumulation was
abolished elicited cells much higher ba levels concomitantly induced,
mainly conjugated form. furthermore, piperonylic acid, inhibitor of
cinnamate-4-hydroxylase used powerful tool redirect metabolic
flow main phenylpropanoid pathway sa biosynthetic branch. under
these conditions, vivo labeling radioisotope dilution experiments with
[(14)c]trans-cinnamic acid precursor clearly indicated free form of
ba produced elicited tobacco cells major precursor sa
biosynthesis. main conjugated form ba accumulating elicitation of
tobacco cells identified first time benzoyl-glucose. data
