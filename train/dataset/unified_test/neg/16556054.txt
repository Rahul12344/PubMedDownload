tumor-selective replicating viruses offer appealing advantages conventional 
cancer therapy. onyx-015 (dl1520) prototype oncolytic adenoviral
therapy. undergone extensive clinical testing proven safety and
evidence promising clinical efficacy. strategy underlying its
tumor-selective cell killing based deletion viral e1b-55k gene,
which crucial efficient viral replication normal cells dispensable 
in tumor cells. originally, successful replication onyx-015 thought to
strictly depend deregulated p53 signaling tumor cells. however, recent
preclinical well clinical evidence questions mechanism. study by
o'shea colleagues immense importance sheds new light the
molecular mechanism underlying tumor-selective replication onyx-015. based
on findings, modulation proposed molecular mechanism by
pharmacologic agents hyperthermia may largely enhance therapeutic index of
onyx-015 tumor cells versus normal tissue improve clinical efficacy.
finally, new strategies allow successful patient stratification future
clinical trials appear reach, based reported results.
