our previous studies showed histophilus somni bovine respiratory
syncytial virus (brsv) act synergistically vivo cause severe bovine
respiratory disease either agent alone causes. since h. somni surface and
secreted immunoglobulin binding protein (ibpa) causes retraction bovine
alveolar type 2 (bat2) cells invasion bat2 cells vitro, we
investigated mechanisms brsv-plus-h. somni infection alveolar barrier. 
brsv treatment bat2 cells prior treatment ibpa-rich h. somni
concentrated culture supernatant (ccs) resulted increased bat2 cell rounding
and retraction compared either treatment alone. mimicked the
increased alveolar cell thickening calves experimentally infected brsv
followed h. somni compared calves infected brsv h. somni
alone. brsv-plus-h. somni ccs treatment bat2 cells also enhanced paracellular 
migration. effect matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) investigated as
well microarray analysis revealed treatment brsv plus h. somni 
synergistically upregulated bat2 cell expression mmp1 mmp3 compared to
that cells treated either agent alone. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(elisa) confirmed mmp1 mmp3 protein levels similarly upregulated.
in collagen collagen iv (targets mmp1 mmp3, respectively) substrate
zymography, digestion increased supernatants dually treated bat2
cells compared singly treated cells. enhanced breakdown of
collagen iv basal lamina fibrillar collagen adjacent
interstitium dual infection may facilitate dissemination h. somni
infection.
