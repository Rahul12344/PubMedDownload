aim: investigate possible association hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection angiographically proven coronary artery disease (cad) a
population relatively high prevalence hbv.
methods: sera 434 patients underwent coronary angiography tested
for hbv antigens (hbsag, hbeag) antibodies (anti-hbs, anti-hbc anti-hbe) 
by elisa.
results: seventy-seven percent (224/291) patients cad 73.4%
(105/143) patients without angiographic evidence atherosclerosis were
seropositive hbv (p > 0.05). however, c-reactive protein (crp) levels were
significantly higher patients cad (p = 0.008), lower hbv
seropositive population (p = 0.043 p = 0.021 adjustment for
conventional risk factors).
conclusion: results suggested hbv infection negatively correlates crp
levels, seems associated coronary atherosclerosis.
