wild waterfowl considered natural reservoir type influenza viruses, 
and migratory nature many waterfowl species presents possible vehicle
for global dissemination infectious agents. order fully understand
the ecology influenza viruses, multiyear surveillance efforts critical,
particularly understudied areas, waterfowl wintering areas. herein 
report results obtained fifth year ofa 5-yr avian influenza virus
(aiv) surveillance project conducted waterfowl wintering grounds texas 
coast. year 5, 2009-2010 hunting season (september, november-january),
655 cloacal swabs collected hunter-harvested waterfowl screened for
aiv real-time rt-pcr (rrt-pcr) followed virus isolation positive
samples. molecular methods used subtyping aiv isolates. sixty-five
(9.5%) samples positive aiv rrt-pcr, 24 (3.7%) aivs were
isolated. eight different hemagglutinin (h3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11) seven
different neuraminidase (n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) subtypes identified. this
was first year h8 h9 isolated throughout 5-yr survey. our
results support fact continued multiyear surveillance natural
reservoirs, particularly understudied areas, needed order better
understand ecology aivs nature.
