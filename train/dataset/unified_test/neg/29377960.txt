interferon-γ (ifn-γ) represents one important innate immunity
responses host combat infections many human viruses including human
herpesviruses. human n-myc interactor (nmi) protein, shown to
interact signal transducer activator transcription (stat) proteins
including stat1, important activation ifn-γ induced stat1-dependent
transcription many genes responsible ifn-γ immune responses. however, no
proteins encoded herpesviruses reported interact nmi and
inhibit nmi-mediated activation ifn-γ immune responses achieve immune
evasion ifn-γ responses. study, show strong evidence the
ul23 protein human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), human herpesvirus, specifically
interacts nmi. interaction identified yeast two-hybrid
screen co-immunoprecipitation human cells. observed nmi, when
bound ul23, associated stat1, suggesting ul23 binding nmi
disrupts interaction nmi stat1. cells overexpressing ul23, we
observed (a) significantly reduced levels nmi stat1 nuclei, the
sites proteins act induce transcription ifn-γ stimulated genes,
and (b) decreased levels induction transcription ifn-γ
stimulated genes. ul23-deficient hcmv mutants induced higher transcription of
ifn-γ stimulated genes exhibited lower titers parental control
revertant viruses expressing functional ul23 ifn-γ treated cells. thus, ul23
appears interact directly nmi inhibit nuclear translocation nmi
and associated protein stat1, leading decrease ifn-γ induced
responses increase viral resistance ifn-γ. results further
highlight roles ul23-nmi interactions facilitating viral immune escape 
from ifn-γ responses enhancing viral resistance ifn antiviral effects.
