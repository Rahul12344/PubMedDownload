background: understanding pathogenesis influenza infection key factor
leading prevention control future outbreaks. pandemic 2009
influenza h1n1 infection, although frequently mild, led severe fatal
form disease certain cases make virulence nature debatable. much
effort made toward explaining determinants disease severity;
however, absolute reason established.
results: study presents heterogeneous virulence clinically similar
strains pandemic 2009 influenza virus human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells
and mice. viruses obtained patients admitted local
hospital china similar course infection recovered. the
a/nanchang/8002/2009 a/nanchang/8011/2009 viruses showed efficient
replication high lethality mice infection a/nanchang/8008/2009 
was lethal impaired viral replication, minimal pathology modest
proinflammatory activity lungs. sequence analysis displayed prominent
differences polymerase subunits (pb2 pa) viral genomes might 
correlate different phenotypic behavior.
conclusions: study confirms biological heterogeneity, linked the
extent viral replication, exists among pandemic h1n1 strains may serve as
a benchmark future investigations influenza pathogenesis.
