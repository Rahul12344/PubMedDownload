the purpose study determine whether retrovirus-mediated transfer
of murine macrophage inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) gene inhibit 
tumorigenicity metastasis human renal cancer cells. retroviral vectors
encoding murine macrophage inos constructed plxsn retroviral vector
with inos gene control long terminal repeat promoter a
neomycin resistance gene control internal simian virus 40
promoter. highly metastatic human renal carcinoma sn12pm6 cells infected
with control inos retrovirus. expression inos confirmed northern and
western blot analyses, expression functional inos protein, i.e.,
production nitric oxide (no), determined measuring nitrite accumulation
in culture supernatants. noninfected control cells produced large orthotopic
tumors kidney nude mice larger number experimental lung
metastases, whereas inos-infected cells produced small tumors kidneys 
few lung metastases. data indicate infection human renal
cancer cells retroviruses harboring murine inos gene induce the
production high levels no, associated autocytotoxicity,
suppression tumorigenicity, abrogation metastasis.
