the transcription initiation signals retroviruses lie within long terminal
repeat (ltr) sequences. found new transcriptional promoter central
portion genome human t-cell leukaemia virus type (htlv-i). the
transcription start site located upstream atg codon the
transcriptional trans-activator molecule, tax protein (tax). internal
promoter may provide new insight gene expression htlv-i. mechanism 
of leukaemogenesis defective htlv-i also discussed. furthermore, we
have identified two repeats novel enhancer sequence agttct, are
located around initiation site. call sequence hire (htlv-i internal
regulatory element).
