feline coronaviruses (fcov) colonize intestinal tract, however, due not
fully understood mutations, spread systemically cause feline
infectious peritonitis (fip). recent studies human medicine report gut
microbiota involved development systemic disorders could
influence immune response viral diseases. aim study to
provide preliminary data fecal microbiota composition healthy cats
compared fcov-infected cats, without fip. cats equally grouped
as healthy fcov-negative, healthy fcov-positive fip affected (total n = 15).
fecal sample evaluated microbiota composition. total 3,231,916 
sequences analyzed. samples' alpha-diversity curves reach a
proper plateau and, beta-diversity, samples seemed group
perfectly category, even healthy fcov-positive group showed hybrid
microbial composition fcov-negative fip groups. although were
no taxa significantly linked different conditions, peculiar patterns 
were recognized: firmicutes always represented phylum, followed by
bacteroidetes actinobacteria. fcov-positive cats, firmicutes and
bacteroidetes respectively over- under-represented, compared the
other groups. among fip cats, three subjects shared similar microbiome, one cat
showed different microbial profile one lowest number of
diverse phyla. despite limited number animals, differences the
fecal microbiome groups observed, suggesting further
investigate possible correlation gut microbiota fcov infection in
cats.
