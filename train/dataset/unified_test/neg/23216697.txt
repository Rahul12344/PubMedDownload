background: safer viral counterparts, conventional non-viral
gene delivery dna vectors offer limited safety profile. often result in
the delivery unwanted prokaryotic sequences, antibiotic resistance genes, 
the bacterial origins replication target, may lead the
stimulation unwanted immunological responses due chimeric dna
composition. vectors may also impart potential chromosomal
integration, thus potentiating oncogenesis. sought engineer vivo
system quick simple production safer dna vector alternatives 
were devoid non-transgene bacterial sequences would lethally disrupt the
host chromosome event unwanted vector integration event.
results: constructed parent eukaryotic expression vector possessing a
specialized manufactured multi-target site called "super sequence", and
engineered e. coli cells (r-cell) conditionally produce phage-derived
recombinase tel (py54), teln (n15), cre (p1). passage parent plasmid
vector r-cells optimized conditions, resulted rapid, efficient, 
and one step vivo generation mini lcc--linear covalently closed
(tel/teln-cell), mini ccc--circular covalently closed (cre-cell), dna
constructs, separated backbone plasmid dna. site-specific integration of
lcc plasmids host chromosome resulted chromosomal disruption and
10(5) fold lower viability seen ccc counterpart.
conclusion: offer high efficiency mini dna vector production system that
confers simple, rapid scalable vivo production mini lcc dna vectors
that possess benefits "minicircle" dna vectors virtually eliminate
the potential undesirable vector integration events.
