p16÷ki-67 dual-stained cytology, either alone combined human
papillomavirus (hpv) 16÷18 genotyping, could useful tool triage for
colposcopy hpv-positive patients. based background, aimed at
comparing diagnostic performance p16÷ki-67 dual staining test, and
high-risk hpv test detection high-risk cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (cin2÷3) patients diagnosed low-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion (lsil) pap smear. performed retrospective study including 184
patients lsil cytology pap smear, 64 referred biopsy
after colposcopy. prior biopsy hpv genotyping dual staining test were
performed 64 patients. mean age patients selected for
conization 36 years seven months. pathological exam showed that
28.13% (18÷64) patients lsil cytology actually cin2÷3: 12
cases cin2, five cases cin3 one case situ cervical carcinoma.
hpv positive 56.25% (36÷64) patients lsil. p16÷ki-67 dual
staining test positive 29.69% (19÷64) patients lsil. among
women lsil cytology, sensitivity specificity hpv genotyping
test predicting cin2÷cin3 94.44% (17÷18) 58.7% (27÷46),
respectively. sensitivity specificity p16÷ki-67 dual staining test
were 66.67% (12÷18) 84.78% (39÷46), respectively. results agree with
other data available literature suggest p16÷ki-67 dual staining
test could included management protocol patients modified
cytology triage test referring patients colposcopy.
