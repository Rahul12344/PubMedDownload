epigenetic mechanisms dna methylation (dnam) central role the
regulation gene expression thereby cellular differentiation tissue 
homeostasis. recently shown aging associated profound
changes dnam. several methylation changes take place clock-like 
fashion, i.e. correlating calendar age individual. thus, the
epigenetic clock based kind dnam changes could provide new
biomarker human aging process, i.e. able separate calendar and
biological age. information correlation time indicated this
clock various aspects immunosenescence still missing. chronic
cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection probably one major driving forces of
immunosenescence, analyzed correlation cmv seropositivity with
the epigenetic age vitality 90+cohort 1920 (122 nonagenarians 21 young
controls, cmv seropositivity rates 95% 57%, respectively). data showed
that cmv seropositivity associated higher epigenetic age of
these age groups (median 26.5 vs. 24.0 (p < 0.02,mann–whitney u-test) the
young controls 76.0 vs. 70.0 (p < 0.01) nonagenarians). thus, these
data provide new aspect cmv associated pathological processes.
