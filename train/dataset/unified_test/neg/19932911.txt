virus-like particles (vlps) present viral antigens native conformation and
are effectively recognized immune system therefore considered as
suitable safe vaccine candidates many viral diseases. we
demonstrate chimeric vlps containing rift valley fever virus (rvfv)
glycoproteins g(n) g(c), nucleoprotein n gag protein moloney
murine leukemia virus represent effective vaccine candidate rift
valley fever, deadly disease humans livestock. long-lasting humoral 
cellular immune responses demonstrated mouse model analysis of
neutralizing antibody titers cytokine secretion profiles. vaccine efficacy
studies performed mouse rat lethal challenge models resulting high
protection rates. taken together, results demonstrate that
replication-incompetent chimeric rvf vlps efficient rvfv vaccine
candidate.
