objective: aim study establish vitro experimental model 
that mimics interaction hepatitis b virus (hbv) trophoblastic
barrier.
study design: barrier represented choriocarcinoma cell line, jar
cells, incubated hbv presence absence tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). 12-hour intervals 24-hour incubation, the
infection efficiency examined enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay culture
supernatants, immunohistochemistry cell slides, western blotting cell
lysates, polymerase chain reaction amplification viral dna infected cells,
and transmission electron microscopy hbsag particles infected cells.
results: absence tnf-alpha, many jar cell colonies showed negative or
punctate positive pattern incubation hbv. jar cells were
pretreated tnf-alpha cocultured hbv, infection greatly
enhanced, whereas differences observed various time points the
second series experiments reach statistically significant level.
conclusion: jar cells support hbv infection presence tnf-alpha. our
in vitro system provides key basis study reflecting mechanism in
vivo hbv intrauterine infection transfer.
