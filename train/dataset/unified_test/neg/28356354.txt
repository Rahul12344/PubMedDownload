the karyopherin transportin sr2 (trn-sr2, tnpo3) responsible shuttling
specific cargoes serine/arginine-rich splicing factors cytoplasm
to nucleus. protein plays key role hiv infection facilitating
the nuclear import pre-integration complex (pic) contains viral
dna well several cellular hiv proteins, including integrase. the
process nuclear import considered bottleneck viral
replication cycle therefore represents promising target anti-hiv drug
design. previous studies demonstrated direct interaction between
trn-sr2 hiv integrase predominantly involves catalytic core domain (ccd) 
and c-terminal domain (ctd) integrase. aimed providing a
detailed molecular view interaction biochemical
characterization respective protein complex. size-exclusion chromatography
was used characterize interaction trn-sr2 truncated variant of
the hiv-1 integrase, including ccd ctd. experiments indicate
that one trn-sr2 molecule specifically bind one ccd-ctd dimer. next, the
regions solenoid-like trn-sr2 molecule involved the
interaction integrase identified using alphascreen binding assays,
revealing integrase interacts n-terminal half trn-sr2
principally heat repeats 4, 10, 11. combining results 
small-angle x-ray scattering data complex trn-sr2 truncated
integrase, propose molecular model complex. speculate nuclear
import pic may proceed concurrently normal nuclear transport.
