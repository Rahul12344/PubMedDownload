mutations hepatitis b virus (hbv) core gene may influence disease activity
by altering immune recognition sites level virus replication. sera 69 
chinese patients chronic hbv infection analyzed direct sequencing of
polymerase chain reaction amplification hbv dna determine frequency and
location naturally occurring hbv core gene mutations. one patient 
nucleotide changes, 44 (64%) patients least one amino acid change
(mean, 3.7; range, 1-13) compared published sequences. multiple
regression analysis showed frequency core gene mutations was
significantly associated precore stop-codon mutation, hepatitis b e antigen 
negativity, active liver disease, patients' age. mean number of
amino acid changes/patient hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag)-positive patients
with elevated versus normal aminotransferase levels were, respectively, 2.8 +/-
0.4 0.6 +/- 0.2. corresponding values hbeag-negative patients were,
respectively, 5.0 +/- 1.2 6.0 +/- 1.5. thirteen patients serially
studied, mean rates amino acid substitution hbeag-positive patients who
did clear hbeag follow-up 5.7 +/- 0.8 0 per codon/yr. 
most mutations clustered codon/yr. mutations 
clustered middle core gene harbor several major b- helper 
t-cell epitopes. mutations found c-terminal part core
gene. summary, mutations core gene frequently detected in
patients chronic hbv infection. mutations occur predominantly around
the time hbeag clearance liver disease active.
