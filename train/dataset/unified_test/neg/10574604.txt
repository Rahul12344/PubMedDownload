in order understand better possible role cell-cycle regulating
molecules pathogenesis hodgkin's disease (hd), immunohistochemical 
distribution pattern p16ink4a investigated compared prb, p53, and
mdm2 protein status 44 hd cases. findings correlated presence 
of epstein-barr virus detected rna situ hybridization and
clinicopathological parameters. p16ink4a protein immunoreactivity found in
all 44 cases proportion hodgkin-reed-sternberg (hrs) cells ranging from
30 90%. 93% cases studied, prb detected hrs, whereas all
cases showed overexpression p53. almost specimens (98%) mdm2-positive
as evaluated 1b10 and/or if2 monoclonal antibodies. eber 1/2-transcripts 
detected 31.8% (14 44) examined samples. significant correlation
was observed immunoreactivity p16ink4a mdm2 number hrs 
cells (p = .0012 p = .018, respectively). subgroup cases, with
p16ink4a expression 50% hrs cells, percentage prb-positive
neoplastic cells inversely related p16-positive ones (p = .007).
no clinicopathological parameters clinical prognostic indicators, including
duration response therapy, statistically related expression
levels four proteins investigated presence epstein-barr
virus. findings suggest p16 prb regularly expressed that
their pathway cell-cycle machinery seems intact hd. however, 
investigation needed shed light involvement cell-cycle molecules 
in hodgkin's lymphomagenesis longer patient follow-up required for
conclusive prognostic correlation.
