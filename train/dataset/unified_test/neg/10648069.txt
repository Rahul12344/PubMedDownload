objective: chronic sinusitis common disease characterized persistent
inflammation nasal paranasal sinus mucosa. accumulating evidence
supports importance proinflammatory cytokines endothelial cell
adhesion molecule (cam) expression initiating process tissue
inflammation. study conducted investigate localization major
cytokines cams maxillary sinus mucosa patients chronic
sinusitis normal subjects.
methods: maxillary sinus mucosal specimens patients chronic sinusitis
(n = 10) normal subjects (n = 6) immunostained specific
antibodies directed cytokines (il-1alpha, il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and
tnf-alpha) cams (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, icam-1 vascular
cam-1, vcam-1).
results: number immunoreactive cells il-1alpha, il-1beta, il-6, il-8, 
and tnf-alpha increased significantly patients chronic sinusitis
compared normal controls. immunoreactivity icam-1 also increased
significantly patients chronic sinusitis compared normal controls,
whereas vcam-1 minimally expressed absent groups.
conclusion: findings indicate bacterial and/or viral infection may
induce functional morphologic changes maxillary sinus mucosa in
chronic sinusitis enhanced generation specific cytokines in
conjunction cams.
