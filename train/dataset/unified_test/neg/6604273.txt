several isolates human t-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (htlv) transmitted 
to normal human cells obtained umbilical cord blood newborns. t
cells seven specimens immortalized infection different htlv
isolates properties compared activated uninfected
normal cells grown presence t-cell growth factor (tcgf) with
those htlv-positive neoplastic t-cell lines derived patients t-cell 
malignancies. htlv-infected cells generally belonged class mature t
cells (okt4+ leu 3a+) differed normal uninfected cells that
they could propagated culture indefinitely; possessed altered morphology,
including convoluted nuclei bi- multinucleated giant cells; formed
large clumps culture; demonstrated diminished requirement tcgf; an
increased density tcgf receptors; often became completely independent of
exogenous tcgf; expressed hla-dr determinants. properties the
htlv-infected cord blood cells contrasted uncultured cord blood t
cells cord blood cells stimulated mitogen grown tcgf but
resembled characteristics t-cell lines established previously from
patients htlv-associated t-cell malignancies. vitro system offers 
unique opportunity study basic mechanism involved abnormal growth and
neoplastic transformation specific class human cells.
