respiratory virus infections cause significant morbidity mortality in
immunocompromised patients. timely diagnosis needed provide optimal
clinical care. diagnostic tests routinely available institutions are
limited poor sensitivity slow turnaround time. collected 90
respiratory samples 87 immunocompromised patients (56 bronchoalveolar lavage
and 34 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples) order compare performance of
routine respiratory virus testing available institution filmarray
respiratory panel assay, novel diagnostic tool utilizes multiplex pcr 
test 21 respiratory pathogens 1-h turnaround time. samples with
discordant results 13 samples concordant results underwent further
verification testing laboratory-developed real-time pcr. filmarray assay
identified viral pathogens samples clinical testing (30/90
versus 16/90; mcnemar p = 0.001). additional viral pathogens
identified filmarray respiratory panel assay confirmed by
verification testing pathogens assessed routine clinical tests,
including rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus. the
filmarray respiratory panel assay allowed increased identification of
respiratory viral pathogens cohort immunocompromised patients.
