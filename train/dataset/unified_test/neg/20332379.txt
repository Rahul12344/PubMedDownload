resistance gene-mediated immunity confers protection pathogen infection
in wide range plants. genetic screen arabidopsis thaliana mutants
compromised recognition turnip crinkle virus previously identified crt1, a
member ghkl atpase/kinase superfamily. here, demonstrate crt1
interacts various resistance proteins different structural classes, and
this interaction disrupted resistance proteins activated. the
arabidopsis mutant crt1-2 crh1-1, lacks crt1 closest homolog,
displayed compromised resistance avirulent pseudomonas syringae and
hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. additionally, resistance-associated
hypersensitive cell death suppressed nicotiana benthamiana silenced for
expression crt1 homolog(s). thus, crt1 appears general factor for
resistance gene-mediated immunity. since elevation cytosolic calcium triggered
by avirulent p. syringae compromised crt1-2 crh1-1 plants, cell death 
triggered nt mek2(dd) unaffected crt1-silenced n. benthamiana, crt1
likely functions early step pathway. genome-wide transcriptome
analysis led identification crt1-associated genes, many are
associated transport processes, responses (a)biotic stress, the
endomembrane system. confocal microscopy subcellular fractionation revealed
that crt1 localizes endosome-like vesicles, suggesting key process in
resistance protein activation/signaling occurs subcellular compartment.
