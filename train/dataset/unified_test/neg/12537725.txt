sexually transmitted diseases (stds) caused organisms infect the
mucosal surfaces genitourinary tract. spite public health
importance, current std vaccine research lags behind work pathogens 
target another mucosal region, respiratory tract. latter case,
live-attenuated viral vaccines, killed whole-cell bacterial vaccines,
subunit/protein bacterial vaccines, bacterial polysaccharide vaccines have
been enormously successful. move std vaccine research forward, complex issues 
must resolved. include selection appropriate antigen (e.g.
scientific feasibility intellectual property rights), manufacture 
vaccine (e.g. delivery systems, formulation processes, production steps), and
the appropriate public health approach (e.g. medical indications marketing
aspects). particular scientific problems delayed std vaccine development,
like incomplete attenuation (human herpes simplex virus type 2), accentuated
immunopathology (chlamydia trachomatis), poor immunogenicity (treponema
pallidum), broad antigenic heterogeneity (neisseria gonorrhoeae).
nevertheless, efforts continue use protein antigens: example, the
haemolysin toxoid haemophilus ducreyi; major outer membrane protein(s) 
n. gonorrhoeae c. trachomatis; glycoprotein human herpes simplex
virus type 2; proteins e6 e7 human papilloma virus. may be
predicted eventual std vaccines (administered either prophylaxis 
therapy) use approaches include (1) live-attenuated viruses, (2)
subunit proteins inactivated whole organisms given mucosal adjuvants or
with cellular immune response adjuvants, (3) dna plasmids expressing the
vaccine antigen.
