human papillomavirus (hpv) e6 e7 consistently expressed are
responsible malignant transformation hpv-associated lesions. thus, e6 
and e7 represent ideal targets therapeutic hpv vaccine development. have
previously used gene gun approach test several intracellular targeting and
intercellular spreading strategies targeting hpv-16 e7. strategies include 
the use sorting signal lysosome-associated membrane protein (lamp-1),
mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), calreticulin (crt) 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) vp22 proteins. strategies have
been shown capable enhancing e7-dna vaccine potency. current
study, characterized dna vaccines employing intracellular targeting
or intercellular spreading strategies targeting hpv-16 e6 ability to
generate e6-specific cd8+ cell immune responses antitumor effects against
an e6-expressing tumor cell line, tc-1, c57bl/6 mice. found the
intracellular targeting strategies (crt, lamp-1, hsp70) well the
intercellular spreading strategy (vp22) able enhance e6 dna vaccine
potency, although orientation hsp70 linked e6 antigen e6 dna
vaccine appears important hsp70 strategy work. enhanced
e6-specific cd8+ cell immune response vaccinated mice also translated into
potent antitumor effects tc-1 tumor cells. data indicate 
the intracellular targeting intercellular spreading strategies been
shown enhance e7 dna vaccine potency also able enhance e6 dna vaccine 
potency.
