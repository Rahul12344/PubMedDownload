causative agent leprosy) recently studied detail. data animal
models clinical trials indicate relatively low doses interleukin-2
effectively stabilize reverse course infections. recent

control infectious diseases, revealing mechanisms involved in
producing disease. increased understanding mechanisms may help extend
interleukin-2 therapy clinical applications.
