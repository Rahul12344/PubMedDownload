pleiotropic mutations appr reduce ph 2.5 acid phosphatase expression and

several strains escherichia coli k12 compared activity the
periplasmic "ph 2.5 acid phosphatase", enzyme whose expression regulated
negatively cyclic amp. two distinct enzyme levels differing four-fold
were observed. strain-dependent difference involve modifications in
the structure enzyme, results difference expression. 
show strains high- low level enzyme differ gene locus 
appr located 59 min region chromosome, site remote the
structural gene appa; appr+ versus appr enzyme ratio 3-4 wild-type
strains, adenylate cyclase-deficient strains (cya) cyclic amp receptor
protein-deficient strains (crp) grown rich medium glucose minimal
medium, close 1 cya strains presence 0.1 mm cyclic amp and
in wild-type strains grown succinate carbon source; crp genetic
background, appr strains, contrary appr+ strains, able grow minimal 
medium succinate sole carbon source. selection, appr+ crp
strain, clones growing succinate-minimal medium, yielded mutations the
same region chromosome showing phenotype as
"naturally-occurring" appr strains. appr strains analysed far showed other
similar deficiencies. possibility mutated appr gene products might
function weak substitutes functional camp-crp complex discussed.
