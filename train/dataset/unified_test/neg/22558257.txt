background: crispr/cas widespread adaptive immune system prokaryotes.
this system integrates short stretches dna derived invading nucleic acids
into genomic crispr loci, function memory previously encountered
invaders. escherichia coli, transcripts loci cleaved small
rnas utilized cascade complex bind invader dna, then
likely degraded cas3 crispr interference.
results: describe crispr-activated e. coli k12 cured high copy
number plasmid non-selective conditions crispr-mediated way. cured
clones integrated least one five anti-plasmid spacers genomic crispr 
loci. new spacers integrated directly downstream leader sequence. 
spacers non-randomly selected target protospacers aag protospacer 
adjacent motif, located directly upstream protospacer. a
co-occurrence pam deviations crispr repeat mutations observed,
indicating one nucleotide pam incorporated last
nucleotide repeat integration new spacer. multiple
spacers integrated single clone, spacer targeted strand of
the plasmid, implying crispr interference caused first integrated
spacer directs subsequent spacer acquisition events strand specific manner.
conclusions: e. coli type i-e crispr/cas system provides resistance against
bacteriophage infection, also enables removal residing plasmids. we
established positive feedback loop active spacers a
cluster--in case first acquired spacer--and spacers acquired thereafter, 
possibly use specific dna degradation products crispr
interference machinery crispr adaptation machinery. loop enables a
rapid expansion spacer repertoire actively present dna element 
that already targeted, amplifying crispr interference effect.
