toll-like receptors (tlrs) germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors
(prrs) activate innate immune system. clear tlrs are
important immune response pathogens, may also exploited by
some pathogens. objective determine whether feline immunodeficiency
virus (fiv) infection affects tlr expression function thereby resulting in
innate immune dysfunction. end, cloned partial sequences feline
tlrs 1--3, 5--8, developed real-time pcr assays quantify feline tlrs 1--9.
tlr expression quantified normal cat lymphoid tissues, purified lymphocyte
subsets, fiv-infected cell lines. different expression patterns tlrs 
found spleen, mesenteric lymph node, retropharyngeal lymph node, thymus,
intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria lymphocytes. b
lymphocytes, cd4+ cells, cd8+ cells expressed tlrs 2--5, 7--9;
however, relative levels expression varied among lymphocyte phenotypes.
infection cell lines fiv resulted altered tlr expression levels that
differed depending cell type. results demonstrate tissue
distribution tlrs associated immunological role particular
tissue, lymphocytes may also express 'innate immune' receptors, and
that fiv infection alter tlr expression.
