background: rift valley fever (rvf) weather dependent arboviral infection of
livestock humans. population dynamics mosquito vectors associated 
disease epidemics. study, use daily temperature rainfall model
inputs simulate dynamics mosquito vectors population relation disease
epidemics.
methods/findings: time-varying distributed delays (tvdd) multi-way functional
response equations implemented simulate mosquito vectors hosts
developmental stages establish interactions stages phases of
mosquito vectors relation vertebrate hosts infection introduction in
compartmental phases. open-source modelling platforms, universal simulator and
qt integrated development environment used develop models c++
programming language. developed models include source codes mosquito
fecundity, host fecundity, water level, mosquito infection, host infection,
interactions, egg time. extensible markup language (xml) files used as
recipes integrate source codes qt creator universal simulator plug-in.
we observed floodwater aedines culicine population continued to
fluctuate temperature water level simulation period while
controlled availability host blood feeding. infection system was
introduced floodwater aedines. culicines pick infection infected host
once amplify disease epidemic. simulated mosquito population show sudden
unusual increase december 1997 january 1998 similar period rvf
outbreak occurred ngorongoro district.
conclusion/significance: findings presented provide new opportunities for
weather-driven rvf epidemic simulation modelling. ideal approach for
understanding disease transmission dynamics towards epidemics prediction,
prevention control. approach used alternative source for
generation calibrated rvf epidemics data different settings.
