pathogenic strains aleutian mink disease virus (amdv) utah-1 not
replicate cell culture (e.g., crandell rees feline kidney cells) 
vitro-adapted amdv strain adv-gorham (adv-g) pathogenic. here, we
constructed full-length infectious clone (padv-g). alignment vp2 gene of
adv-g amdv strains revealed many amino acid (a.a.) residues
conserved among pathogenic isolates differed adv-g. four
virulence-associated, conserved residues padv-g vp2 studied by
site-directed mutagenesis (h92a, q94s, y115f, i116l). mutation residue 92 
or 94 decreased viral-transcription viral-infectivity levels, whereas
mutation residue 115 116 affect viral-infectivity crfk cells.
these results indicated vp2 residues 92 94, located surface 
of viral capsid, critical amdv infectivity vitro.
