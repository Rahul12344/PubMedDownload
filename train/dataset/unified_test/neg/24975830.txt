the frequency different subsets cd4(+)cxcr5(+) tfh cells serum cytokine
levels analyzed total 14 patients newly diagnosed hepatitis b
virus-associated membranous nephropathy (hbv-mn), 12 individuals with
immune-tolerant hbv infection (hbv-it) 12 healthy controls (hc). serum
cytokine levels measured 10-12 weeks treatment.
significantly higher frequency cd4(+)cxcr5(+), cd4(+)cxcr5(+)icos(+) and
cd4(+)cxcr5(+)pd-1(+) tfh cells, higher serum levels il-17a, ifn-γ, il-2, 
il-10, il-4 il-21 detected hbv-mn patients compared hc. the
percentage cd4(+)cxcr5(+) tfh cells serum il-21 level hbv-mn patients
were also higher hbv-it. percentage cd4(+)cxcr5(+) tfh cell was
negatively correlated value egfr, percentage of
cd4(+)cxcr5(+)icos(+) tfh cells positively correlated 24-h urinary
protein concentration. notably, percentage cd4(+)cxcr5(+)pd-1(+) tfh cells
was positively correlated serum il-21 level 24-h urinary protein
concentration. treatment prednisone or/and immunosuppressive drugs
significantly reduced frequency cd4(+)cxcr5(+), cd4(+)cxcr5(+)pd-1(+) tfh 
cells serum il-21 level, increased il-4 il-10 levels patients.
cd4(+)cxcr5(+) tfh cells, especially cd4(+)cxcr5(+)pd-1(+) tfh cells may
participate pathogenesis hbv-mn.
