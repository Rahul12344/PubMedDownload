the neuroimmunodegenerative syndrome develops mice infected ts1, a
mutant moloney murine leukemia virus, resembles human aids. ts1 human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 infect astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes 
but infect neurons. oxidative stress implicated the
neuropathology aids dementia neurodegenerative diseases. report
here ts1 infection astrocytes (both transformed c1 cells primary
cultures) also induces thiol (i.e., glutathione cysteine) depletion and
reactive oxygen species (ros) accumulation, events occurring parallel with
viral envelope precursor gpr80(env) accumulation upregulated expression of
endoplasmic reticulum chaperones grp78 grp94. furthermore, ts1-infected
astrocytes mobilize thiol redox defenses upregulating levels the
nrf-2 transcription factor, well targets, xct cystine/glutamate
antiporter, gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase, glutathione peroxidase. depleting 
intracellular thiols treating uninfected astrocytes buthionine
sulfoximine (bso), glutathione synthesis inhibitor, culturing in
cystine-deficient medium, also induces ros accumulation, activates nrf-2, and
upregulates nrf-2 target gene expression astrocytes. overexpression of
nrf-2 astrocytes specifically increases expression thiol
synthesis-related proteins. treatment bso n-acetylcysteine in
transfected cells modulates expression. thiol depletion also accelerates
cell death, thiol supplementation promotes survival ts1-infected cells. 
together, results indicate ts1 infection astrocytes, along with
ts1-induced gpr80(env) accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, thiol
depletion, oxidative stress, accelerates cell death; response thiol
depletion oxidative stress, astrocytes activate nrf-2-mediated thiol
antioxidant defenses, promoting cell survival.
