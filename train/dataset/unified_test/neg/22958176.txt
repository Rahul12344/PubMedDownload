aims: plasmablastic lymphoma (pbl) aggressive lymphoma terminally
differentiated b cell phenotype; half patients disease have
epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection. majority pbl cases associated with
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, remaining hiv-negative
cases accompanied immunodeficiency conditions immunosenescence
in elderly.
methods results: characterize hiv-negative pbl elderly (pbl-e), 
compared clinicopathological characteristics 10 cases pbl-e 124
cases age-related ebv-associated b cell lymphoproliferative disorder
(ar-ebvlpd). 10 pbl-e (eight men, two women; median age: 68 years) were
associated indolent clinical behaviour better overall survival 
than ar-ebvlpd. extranodal involvement higher pbl-e (50%) ar-ebvlpd; 
notably, nasal cavity affected frequently pbl-e (60%).
immunoglobulin heavy chain/(igh)/myc translocation detected half the
pbl-e cases.
conclusions: pbl-e shares clinical features ar-ebvlpd, hiv
negativity, old age, ebv infection, known immunosuppressive condition 
there differences higher ratio extranodal involvement and
better prognosis. pbl-e newly recognized condition be
distinguished hiv-positive pbl, sharing features ar-ebvlpd in
particular, immunosenescence elderly.
