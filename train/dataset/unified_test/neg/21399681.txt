background: characterization viruses hiv-1 transmission pairs help
identify biological determinants infectiousness evaluate candidate
interventions reduce transmission. although hiv-1 sequencing frequently
used substantiate linkage newly hiv-1 infected individuals their
sexual partners epidemiologic forensic studies, viral sequencing seldom
applied hiv-1 prevention trials. partners prevention hsv/hiv
transmission study (clinicaltrials.gov #nct00194519) prospective randomized
placebo-controlled trial enrolled serodiscordant heterosexual couples to
determine efficacy genital herpes suppression reducing hiv-1
transmission; part study analysis, hiv-1 sequences examined for
genetic linkage seroconverters enrolled partners.
methodology/principal findings: obtained partial consensus hiv-1 env gag
sequences blood plasma 151 transmission pairs performed deep
sequencing env cases. analyzed sequences phylogenetic
techniques developed bayesian algorithm evaluate probability of
linkage. linkage, required monophyletic clustering enrolled
partners' sequences bayesian posterior probability â‰¥ 50%. adjudicators
classified seroconversion, finding 108 (71.5%) linked, 40 (26.5%) unlinked, 
and 3 (2.0%) indeterminate transmissions, linkage determined consensus
env sequencing 91 (84%). male seroconverters higher frequency of
unlinked transmissions female seroconverters. likelihood transmission
from enrolled partner related time study, increasing numbers
of unlinked transmissions occurring longer observation periods. finally,
baseline viral load found significantly higher among linked
transmitters.
conclusions/significance: first use hiv-1 sequencing establish
endpoints large clinical trial, one-fourth transmissions were
unlinked enrolled partner, illustrating relevance methods 
the design future hiv-1 prevention trials serodiscordant couples. a
hierarchy sequencing techniques, analysis methods, expert adjudication
contributed linkage determination process.
