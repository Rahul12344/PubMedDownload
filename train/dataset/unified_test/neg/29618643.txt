the mature envelope glycoprotein (env) spike surfaces human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)-infected cells virions derived 
proteolytic cleavage trimeric gp160 glycoprotein precursor. these
studies, compared conformations cleaved uncleaved membrane envs
with truncated cytoplasmic tails stabilized soluble gp140 sosip.664
env trimers. deletion gp41 cytoplasmic tail significantly affect
the sensitivity viruses hiv-1ad8 env inhibition antibodies a
cd4-mimetic compound. glutaraldehyde fixation purification from
membranes, cleaved env exhibited hydrodynamic radius ∼10 nm an
antibody-binding profile largely consistent expected based virus
neutralization sensitivity. purified cleaved env trimers exhibited hollow
architecture central void near trimer axis. uncleaved env,
cross-linked purified parallel, exhibited hydrodynamic radius similar to
that cleaved env. however, uncleaved env recognized poorly
neutralizing antibodies appeared negative-stain electron microscopy to
sample multiple conformations. compared membrane envs, stabilized soluble
gp140 sosip.664 env trimers appear compact, reflected their
smaller hydrodynamic radii negative-stain electron microscopy structures. the
antigenic features soluble gp140 sosip.664 env trimers differed those
of cleaved membrane env, particularly gp120 v3 cd4-binding-site
epitopes. thus, proteolytic maturation allows membrane-anchored env to
achieve conformation retains functional metastability masks epitopes
for poorly neutralizing antibodies.importance entry human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) host cells mediated envelope glycoprotein
(env) spike surface virus. host antibodies elicited natural 
hiv-1 infection vaccination potentially recognize env spike and
block hiv-1 infection. however, changing shape hiv-1 env spike
protects virus antibody binding. understanding shapes natural and
man-made preparations hiv-1 envs assist development effective
vaccines virus. here, evaluate effects several env
modifications commonly used produce env preparations vaccine studies and
the determination structure. found cleavage hiv-1 env
precursor helps env assume natural shape, resists binding of
many commonly elicited antibodies. stabilized soluble envs exhibit compact
shapes expose env elements differently natural env.
