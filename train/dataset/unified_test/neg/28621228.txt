alpha-fetoprotein effective biomarker aid hepatocellular carcinoma
detection many countries. however, alpha-fetoprotein limitations,
especially early hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis. protein induced by
vitamin k absence antagonist-ii another biomarker used for
hepatocellular carcinoma detection. aim study compare the
diagnostic performance alpha-fetoprotein protein induced vitamin k
absence antagonist-ii alone combination explore improving biomarker 
performance aid early hepatocellular carcinoma detection. study 
a total 582 serum samples including 132 hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 250
non-hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 200 healthy volunteers collected.
alpha-fetoprotein protein induced vitamin k absence antagonist-ii
levels measured chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay lumipulse
platform chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay architect platform.
receiver operation characteristic curve analyses performed each
biomarker combination. results showed alpha-fetoprotein and
protein induced vitamin k absence antagonist-ii combination shown
higher area curve compared alpha-fetoprotein alone diagnosis 
whole patients (0.906 vs 0.870) hepatocellular carcinoma early-stage patients 
(0.809 vs 0.77) hepatitis b virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma
patients (0.851 vs 0.788) architect platform. protein induced vitamin k
absence antagonist-ii showed higher area curve than
alpha-fetoprotein diagnosis hepatitis b virus-related hepatocellular
carcinoma patients (0.901 vs 0.788).we conclude combining alpha-fetoprotein 
and protein induced vitamin k absence antagonist-ii may improve the
diagnostic value early detection hepatocellular carcinoma. protein induced
by vitamin k absence antagonist-ii performs better alpha-fetoprotein in
diagnosis hepatitis b virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
