dna replication intermediates three plasmids containing part a
modified epstein-barr virus cis-acting plasmid maintenance region (orip) were
examined investigate orip function. replication intermediates were
analyzed vivo vitro neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis. major functional components wild-type orip a
140-bp dyad symmetry region (single dyad) 20 tandem copies repeat a
30-bp consensus sequence (family repeats). modified orip constructed 
replacing family repeats three tandem copies single dyad (d.
a. wysokenski j. l. yates, j. virol. 63:2657-2666, 1989). initiation was
observed vivo near single dyad modified orip, seen the
wild-type orip (t. a. gahn c. l. schildkraut, cell 58:527-535, 1989), was
not observed near tandem dyads. replication barrier termination were
observed near tandem dyads similar observed family
of repeats wild-type orip (gahn schildkraut, cell 58:527-535, 1989).
in vitro experiments indicate viral trans-acting factor ebna-1
contributes efficient barrier formation tandem dyads observed the
family repeats wild-type orip (v. dhar c. l. schildkraut, mol.
cell. biol. 11:6268-6278, 1991). tandem dyads thus appear function a
manner similar family repeats. significant structural
differences family repeats tandem dyads. relationship
between number relative positions ebna-1 binding sites relation 
the functions family repeats dyad symmetry element is
discussed.
