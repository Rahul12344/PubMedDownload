background: previously demonstrated plasmid dna transport into
the nucleus could increased transcription factor binding. chose the
glucocorticoid responsive element (gre) binds glucocorticoid
receptor (gr), transcription factor shuttled nucleus upon
ligand binding dexamethasone.
methods: cloned two, four, eight repetitive sequences gre 
reporter plasmid pegfpluc. binding pegfpluc-gre gr examined 
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) experiments. gr expression in
bronchiolar alveolar epithelial cells confirmed western blotting.
intracellular trafficking gr examined using fusion protein of
cyano-fluorescent protein (cfp) gr. transfection efficiencies pegfpluc
compared pegfplucgre(2-8) examined vitro vivo upon tail vein
injection cationic liposome gene vectors containing dexamethasone (safeplexes)
and aerosol application polyethylenimine (pei)-pdna particles.
results: binding gre containing plasmids gr shown emsa
experiments intranuclear shuttling cfp-gr ligand stimulation was
confirmed. enhanced gene transfer efficiency pegfplucgre(2) vitro 
observed confluent cells. 2.5-fold increase gene expression lungs 
of mice tail vein injection pegfplucgre(2) complexed safeplexes
compared pegfpluc observed. pei-mediated aerosol gene delivery of
pegfplucgre(2) 4.7-fold higher pegfpluc intraperitoneal
dexamethasone.
conclusion: results suggest inclusion gre sequences plasmid dna 
vectors combined dexamethasone application could improve transgene
expression lungs vivo.
