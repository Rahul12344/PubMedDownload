herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) contagious neurotropic herpesvirus
responsible oral lesions herpesviral encephalitis. hsv-1 envelope
contains n-glycosylated proteins involved infection candidate
drug targets. ngi-1 small-molecule inhibitor oligosaccharyltransferase
(ost) complexes stt3a-ost stt3b-ost, catalyze cotranslational and
post-translational n-glycosylation, respectively. host osts attach hsv-1 
glycans, ngi-1 might anti-hsv-1 activity. evaluated hsv-1 function using 
ngi-1 human embryonic kidney 293 knockout lines ost isoform-specific
catalytic accessory subunits. n-glycosylation 2 representative envelope
proteins (gc gd) primarily dependent upon stt3a-ost, large
extent replaceable stt3b-ost. knockouts impairing stt3a- stt3b-ost
activity, themselves, appreciably affect hsv-1 function
(plaque-forming units, normalized viral particles measured unglycosylated
capsid protein vp5 content). however, cells lacking stt3b-ost activity
(missing catalytic subunit stt3b oxidoreductase subunits magnesium
transporter 1/tumor suppressor candidate 3) thus solely dependent upon
stt3a-ost n-glycosylation, ngi-1 treatment resulted hsv-1 cell
type-dependent dysfunction (affecting infectivity vero cells much 
with 293 lines). ablation post-translational n-glycosylation therefore
make hsv-1 infectivity, possibly masking immunogenic peptide epitopes by
glycans, highly sensitive pharmacological inhibition cotranslational
