background: herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2) reactivation accompanied 
sustained influx cd4(+) cd8(+) cells persist genital tissue 
extended periods. cd4(+) cells long recognized present
in herpetic ulcerations, role subclinical reactivation persistence
is less well known, especially role cd4(+) regulatory cells (tregs).
methods: characterized treg (cd4(+)foxp3(+)) population human hsv-2
reactivation situ sequential genital skin biopsy specimens obtained from
hsv-2-seropositive subjects time lesion onset 8 weeks after
healing.
results: high numbers tregs infiltrated site viral reactivation 
persisted proximity conventional cd4(+) cells (tconvs) cd8(+) t
cells. treg density peaked lesion stage reactivation. the
number tregs time points (lesion, healed, 2 weeks healing, 4
weeks healing, 8 weeks healing) significantly higher 
control biopsy specimens unaffected skin. direct correlation
between hsv-2 titer treg density.
conclusions: association high treg tconv ratio high viral
shedding suggests balance regulatory effector cells
influences human hsv-2 disease.
