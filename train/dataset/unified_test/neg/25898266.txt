in quest treat intracellular infectious diseases virus infection,
nanoparticles (nps) considered efficient tools inducing
potent immune responses, specifically cellular immunity. antigen processing and
presenting antigen presenting cells (apcs) could influence immune response,
especially priming t-cell-mediated cellular immunity. here, fabricated 
ph-responsive poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga) nps rapid antigen
intracellular release behavior apcs. nps, thin shells large 
inner space, contain ammonium bicarbonate (nh4hco3), could regulate release
in endosomes lysosomes, acting antigen release promoter dendritic
cells (dcs), coencapsulated antigen (ovalbumin, ova). hydrogen ions
(h(+)) dc endosomes lysosomes (ph ∼5.0 6.5) could react nh4hco3
to generate nh3 co2, broke nps released antigens. uptake by
dcs, antigens encapsulated ph-responsive plga nps could escape lysosomes 
into cytoplasm cross-presented. moreover, nps induced
up-regulation co-stimulatory molecules stimulated cytokine production.
mouse immunization ph-responsive plga nps induced greater lymphocyte
activation, antigen-specific cd8(+) cells, stronger cytotoxic capacity
(ifn-γ granzyme b), enhanced antigen-specific igg antibodies, higher
serum igg2a/igg1, indicating cellular immunity. nps also improved generation 
of memory cells protect reinfection. thus, ph-responsive plga nps,
which induced strong cellular immune responses offered antibody protection,
could potentially useful effective vaccine delivery adjuvant systems
for therapy intracellular infectious diseases virus infection.
