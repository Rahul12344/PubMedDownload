the primary objective study determine role picornavirus 
flu-like episodes (temperature > =38.0 degrees c plus one respiratory and
one constitutional symptom) among otherwise healthy adults enrolled a
placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized oseltamivir treatment study.
combined nasal pharyngeal swabs collected baseline influenza
cultures picornavirus reverse transcription (rt)-pcr. addition, acute- and
convalescent-serum samples obtained serological studies common
respiratory pathogens. total 719 subjects enrolled clinical
trial within 36 h onset symptoms, 475 (66%) evidence recent
influenza b virus infections means culture and/or serological testing.
of 244 remaining patients, 36 (15%) presented seroconversion least
one common respiratory viruses atypical pathogens. rt-pcr assay 
the picornavirus 5" noncoding region (ncr) positive subset 15 (19%)
of 78 patients flu-like illnesses undetermined etiology. sequence
analysis picornavirus 5" ncr amplicons revealed 14 (93%) 
greater homology rhinoviruses, whereas 1 (7%) related enteroviruses.
interestingly, median total symptom scores oral temperatures of
picornavirus-positive patients (n = 15) placebo-treated influenza
virus-positive patients (n = 161) similar 3-week period. conclude 
that, among influenza virus-negative preselected cases study,
rhinoviruses relatively frequent pathogens associated important
respiratory systemic symptoms.
