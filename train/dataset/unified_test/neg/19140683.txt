the role played stereochemistry c2-substituent (left part) the
s-dabo scaffold anti-hiv-1 activity investigated first time.
a series s-dabo analogues, double bond c2-substituent is
replaced enantiopure isosteric cyclopropyl moiety, synthesized,
leading identification potent lead compound endowed picomolar
activity rt (wt) nanomolar activity selected drug-resistant
mutants. molecular modeling calculation, enzymatic studies, surface plasmon
resonance experiments allowed us rationalize biological behavior the
synthesized compounds, act mixed-type inhibitors hiv-1 rt k103n, with
a preferential association enzyme-substrate complex. taken together, our
data show right combination stereochemistry left right
parts (c6-substituent) s-dabo scaffold plays key role inhibition 
of wild-type drug-resistant enzymes, especially k103n mutant.
