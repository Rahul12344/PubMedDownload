the aim study evaluate plasma levels n-terminal pro-brain
natriuretic peptide (n-bnp), n-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (n-anp)
and antidiuretic hormone (adh) time relationship clinical
indicators hospitalized children bronchiolitis. prospective crossover
clinical investigation. hospitalized children university-affiliated
hospital. twenty-seven children (birth 24 mo) first episode of
bronchiolitis 34 age-matched healthy controls. daily blood samples five
consecutive days obtained n-bnp, n-anp adh bronchiolitis
group initial blood draw control group. daily total fluid
intake, net fluid balance clinical bronchiolitis severity levels were
recorded. n-bnp n-anp levels measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. adh levels measured double antibody technique. mean age
(months ± sd) bronchiolitis group 4.2 ± 5.9 mo 12.0 ± 6.1 mo in
the control group; 51.9% bronchiolitis patients positive respiratory 
syncytial virus (rsv). patients bronchiolitis admission, plasma n-bnp 
measurements (mean ± sd) elevated (996.0 ± 570.2 fmol/ml) compared to
controls (552.7 ± 264.7 fmol/ml p < 0.005). serum n-anp levels also
initially elevated (3,889 ± 1,769.7 fmol/ml) compared controls (2,173 ± 912
fmol/ml p < 0.005). serum levels n-bnp n-anp remained significantly
elevated day 2 day 5. similarly, adh levels significantly
higher admission bronchiolitis group (10 ± 7.49 pg/ml) vs. control 
group (5.8 ± 5.5 pg/ml p < 0.05), quickly decreased day 2 day 5.
n-bnp, n-anp adh concentrations elevated hospitalized children with
bronchiolitis admission. based observation, judicious fluid management 
is indicated children hospitalized bronchiolitis.
