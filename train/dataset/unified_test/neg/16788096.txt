the human genetic disease x-linked lymphoproliferative disease (xlp), is
caused mutations sh2d1a/sap encode slam-associated protein (sap), is
characterized inability control epstein-barr virus (ebv) and
hypogammaglobulinemia. unclear aspects xlp disease specific to
herpesvirus infection reflect general immunologic functions performed
by sap. examined sap- mice chronic lcmv infection, specifically to
address following question: sap deficiency immunologic problems are
general, ebv specific? illness, weight loss, prolonged viral
replication much severe sap- mice. aggressive immunopathology was
observed. inability control chronic lcmv associated cd8
t-cell b-cell response defects. importantly, demonstrate sap- cd8 t
cells primary cause immunopathology clinical illness, 
depletion cd8 cells blocked disease. first direct demonstration 
of sap- cd8 t-cell-mediated immunopathology, confirming 30 years xlp clinical 
observations indirect experimentation. addition, germinal center formation
was extremely defective chronically infected sap- animals, and
hypogammaglobulinemia observed. findings chronic viral infection
mouse model recapitulate key features human xlp clarify sap's critical
role regulating cellular humoral immunity.
