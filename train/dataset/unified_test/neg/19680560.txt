highly pathogenic influenza virus (hpaiv) h5n1 proved remarkably mobile 
migratory bird populations led extensive outbreaks 
true number affected birds usually cannot determined. evaluation of
avian influenza monitoring hpaiv early warning systems, propose a
time-series analysis includes estimation confidence intervals (i)
the prevalence outbreak situations (ii) apparent absence disease 
in time intervals specified regional units. german outbreak regions
in 2006 2007, upper 95% confidence limit allowed detection of
prevalences 1% certain time intervals. although 25,000
birds sampled germany per year, upper 95% confidence limit not
fall 5% outbreak regions time. proposed analysis
can used monitor water bodies high risk areas, also part an
early-warning system. chances improved targeting monitoring system 
as part risk-based approach discussed perspective reducing
sample sizes.
