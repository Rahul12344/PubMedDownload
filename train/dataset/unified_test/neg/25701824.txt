understanding diversity henipaviruses related viruses important 
determining viral ecology within flying-fox populations assessing the
potential threat posed agents. study sought identify the
abundance diversity previously unknown paramyxoviruses (upvs) in
australian flying-fox species (pteropus alecto, pteropus scapulatus, pteropus
poliocephalus pteropus conspicillatus) christmas island species
pteropus melanotus natalis. using degenerative reverse transcription-pcr
specific l gene known species genus henipavirus two closely
related paramyxovirus genera respirovirus morbillivirus, identified an
abundance diversity previously upvs, representative 31 upvs
clustering eight distinct groups (100 upvs/495 samples). new henipaviruses 
were identified. findings consistent hypothesis co-evolution
of paramyxoviruses flying-fox hosts. quantification degree of
co-speciation host virus (beyond scope study) would
strengthen hypothesis.
