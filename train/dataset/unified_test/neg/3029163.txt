we characterized genomic variation adenovirus type 5 isolates recovered
from bone marrow transplant recipients seattle 1976 1982. by
restriction endonuclease analysis, identified three new adenovirus genomic
variants, associated single invasive adenovirus infection. in
addition, able obtain suggestive evidence nosocomial spread a
particular group isolates within population. study demonstrates that
the technique restriction endonuclease analysis important
epidemiological tool investigating viral infections.
