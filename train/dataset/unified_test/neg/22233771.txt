background: ixodes ricinus main vector europe human-pathogenic lyme 
borreliosis (lb) spirochaetes, tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) other
pathogens humans domesticated mammals. results previous 1994
questionnaire, directed people living central north sweden (svealand
and norrland) aiming gather information tick exposure humans and
domestic animals, suggested ixodes ricinus ticks become widespread 
in central sweden southern part north sweden early 1980s to
the early 1990s. investigate whether expansion tick's northern
geographical range increasing abundance ticks sweden still
occurring, 2009 performed follow-up survey 16 years initial
study.
methods: questionnaire similar one used 1994 study published 
in swedish magazines aimed dog owners, home owners, hunters. the
questionnaire published together popular science article the
tick's biology role pathogen vector sweden. magazines were
selected get information people familiar ticks spend time in
areas ticks might present.
results: analyses data surveys revealed near 30-year
period early 1980s 2008, i. ricinus expanded distribution
range northwards. early 1990s ticks found new areas along the
northern coastline baltic sea, 2009 study, ticks were
reported first time many locations north sweden. included
locations far north 66°n places interior part north sweden.
during 16-year period tick's range sweden estimated have
increased 9.9%. range expansion occurred north sweden (north of
60°n) tick's coverage area doubled 12.5% early 1990s to
26.8% 2008. moreover, according respondents, abundance ticks had
increased markedly lb- tbe-endemic areas south (götaland) central
sweden.
conclusions: results suggest i. ricinus expanded range north 
sweden become distinctly abundant central south sweden during
the last three decades. however, northern mountain region i. ricinus is
still absent. increased abundance tick explained two main
factors: first, high availability large numbers important tick
maintenance hosts, i.e., cervids, particularly roe deer (capreolus capreolus)
during last three decades. second, warmer climate milder winters a
prolonged growing season permits greater survival proliferation a
larger geographical area tick deer. high reproductive
potential roe deer, high tick infestation rate tendency roe deer to
disperse great distances may explain range expansion i. ricinus and
particularly appearance new tbev foci far away old tbev-endemic
localities. geographical presence lb sweden corresponds the
distribution i. ricinus. thus, lb emerging disease risk many
parts north sweden. unless countermeasures undertaken keep deer
populations, particularly c. capreolus dama dama, relatively low
levels prevailed late 1970s--especially around urban areas
where human population density high--by e.g. reduced hunting red fox
(vulpes vulpes) lynx (lynx lynx), incidences human lb tbe are
expected continue high even increase sweden coming decades.
