the e1 glycoprotein coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus a59 synthesized in
vitro translation viral mrna presence dog pancreatic microsomes. 
its disposition membrane investigated digestion proteases 
by selective nh2-terminal labeling. protein spans membrane, only
small portions nh2 cooh terminus exposed respectively the
lumenal cytoplasmic domains; bulk molecule apparently buried in
the membrane. protein lacks cleavable leader sequence acquire 
its characteristic o-linked oligosaccharides rough microsomes. may enter
the membrane stage synthesis first 150 amino acid residues. 
these unusual features protein might help explain not
transported cell surface vivo remains intracellular membranes,
causing virus bud there.
