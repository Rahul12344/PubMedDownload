objectives: nephrotoxicity cadmium low levels exposure, measured 
urinary cadmium, recently questioned since co-excretion cadmium and
proteins may causes cadmium toxicity. aim study was
to explore relation kidney function low moderate cadmium
levels, measured directly kidney biopsies.
methods: analysed cadmium kidney biopsies (k-cd), blood (b-cd) urine
(u-cd) 109 living kidney donors cross-sectional study. measured
glomerular filtration rate (gfr), cystatin c serum, albumin, β-2-microglobulin
(b2m), retinol-binding protein (rbp), α-1-microglobulin (a1m),
n-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase kidney injury molecule 1 (kim-1) 24 h and
overnight urine.
results: found significant positive associations a1m excretion and
k-cd multiple regression models including age, sex, weight, smoking and
urinary flow rate. association also present never-smokers. a1m was
also positively associated b-cd u-cd. gfr biomarkers of
kidney function associated k-cd. gfr estimated serum cystatin 
c showed poor correlation measured gfr. kim-1, rbp possibly
albumin positively associated u-cd, overnight urine. no
associations found b2m.
conclusions: results suggest a1m urine sensitive biomarker for
effects low-level cadmium exposure. associations renal
biomarkers u-cd, k-cd, probably caused physiological
co-excretion chance.
