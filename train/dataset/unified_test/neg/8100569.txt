binding hiv-1 major viral surface glycoprotein, gp120, major cell
receptor, cd4, essential hiv infection target cell syncytium
formation. enzyme-linked immunoassay using solid phase cd4 used to
quantitate binding hiv-1 gp120 cd4, assess activity and
mechanism action putative inhibitors reaction. monoclonal
antibodies gp120 binding site cd4 (e.g., leu3a) blocked gp120 binding, 
while monoclonal antibodies portions cd4 (e.g. okt4) not. both
aurintricarboxylic acid sulfonated polysaccharides (e.g., dextran sulfate)
blocked cd4-gp120 interactions binding cd4 component. human polyclonal 
antibodies gp120 also blocked gp120-cd4 binding, none monoclonal
antibodies tested (including several neutralizing activity) effective. 
in contrast, several lectins (including mannose binding protein) bound gp120
and blocked cd4-gp120 interactions. enzymatic deglycosylation gp120 only
minimally affected cd4 binding capacity, non-glycosylated gp120
(produced escherichia coli)-bound cd4 10-fold less well than
fully-glycosylated material. results demonstrate assay system can
be used measure activity inhibitors cd4-gp120 binding, to
determine mechanism action inhibitors.
