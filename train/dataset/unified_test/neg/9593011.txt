influenza immunostimulating complexes (flu-iscoms) monovalent subvirion
vaccine prepared h1n1 strain influenza virus compared mice for
immunogenicity protection challenge homologous heterotypic
influenza viruses. flu-iscoms subvirion vaccine fully protected mice
against homologous virus challenge one immunization assessed by
measurement virus lung titers. improved protection induced flu-iscoms
was associated 10-fold higher prechallenge serum hemagglutination
inhibition titer. furthermore, flu-iscoms fully protected mice against
mortality reduced morbidity following challenge influenza virus of
the serologically distinct h2n2 subtype. cross-protection correlated with
the induction virus cross-reactive cytotoxic lymphocytes recognized a
known major histocompatibility class (h2-kd)-restricted epitope within the
hemagglutinin influenza virus conserved among h1 h2 influenza 
virus subtypes. flu-iscoms may offer significant advantages current
commercial formulations improved influenza vaccine.
