ribose-binding protein exported periplasmic compartment escherichia 
coli process involves proteolytic cleavage amino-terminal
extension amino acids precursor form protein. collection 
of mutants isolated defective rbs transport system, strain was
identified contained precursor ribose-binding protein, none which
was exported normal location periplasm. mutated rbsb contained 
a base substitution results change leucine proline at
position-17 signal sequence. pseudorevertant mutant contained
proteolytically processed, active ribose-binding protein periplasm. the
pseudorevertant rbsb carried second mutation: serine position-15 the
signal sequence changed phenylalanine. isolation signal sequence
mutant corresponding pseudorevertant without specific selection or
site-directed mutagenesis emphasizes possibility obtaining export mutants 
without use procedures could bias limit range mutations
found. explanation extreme phenotype mutant effective
correction phenotype pseudorevertant requires extension current
notions critical features signal sequences.
