objective: explore genotype distribution high-risk human papillomavirus
(hr-hpv) attribution different grades cervical lesions rural
china, contribute type-specific hpv screening tests the
development new polyvalent hpv vaccines among chinese population.
methods: one thousand two hundred ninety-two subjects followed based 
shanxi province cervical cancer screening study (spoccs-i), screened hpv
dna testing (hybrid capture® 2 [hc2]), liquid-based cytology (lbc), if
necessary, directed random colposcopy-guided quadrant biopsies. hpv genotyping
with linear inverse probe hybridization (spf10-pcr-lipa) performed hc2
positive specimens. attribution specific hr-hpv type different grades of
cervical lesions estimated using fractional contribution approach.
results: excluding incomplete data, 1,274 women included final 
statistical analysis. fifteen point two percent (194/1,274) women hr-hpv 
positive 13 hr-hpv types (hpv16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56,
58, 59, 68) common hr-hpv types hpv16 (19.1%) hpv52
(16.5%). genotypes frequently detected hr-hpv-positive cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (cin1) hpv52 (24.1%), hpv31 (20.7%), hpv16
(13.8%), hpv33 (13.8%), hpv39 (10.3%), hpv56 (10.3%); hr-hpv-positive
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 worse (cin2+): hpv16 (53.1%), hpv58
(15.6%), hpv33 (12.5%), hpv51 (9.4%), hpv52 (6.3%). hpv52, 31, 16, 33, 39,
and 56 together contributed 89.7% hr-hpv-positive cin1, hpv16, 33, 58, 
51, 52 together contributed 87.5% cin2+.
conclusion: summary, found substantial differences prevalence and
attribution cins different oncogenic hpv types rural chinese
population, especially hpv16, 31, 33, 52, 58. differences may be
relevant clinical management design preventive strategies.
