hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) are
serious complications transplant patients. aim review to
summarize evidence regarding nosocomial pneumonia transplant recipients,
including hap non-ventilated patients vap, identify future
directions improvement.a comprehensive literature search the
pubmed/medline database performed. articles written english published 
between 1990 november 2018 included. hap/vap transplant patients
usually occurs early post-transplant, particularly neutropenia in
haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. bacteria leading cause of
nosocomial pneumonia immunocompetent transplant recipients, being
gram negative organisms, especially pseudomonas aeruginosa, highly prevalent.
multidrug-resistant bacteria special concern. pneumonia transplant 
setting may caused opportunistic pathogens, differential diagnosis 
needs extended non-infectious complications. relevant
opportunistic pathogens aspergillus fumigatus, pneumocystis jirovecii and
cytomegalovirus. nevertheless, exceptional cause nosocomial
pneumonia, usually occur severely immunosuppressed patients receiving 
antimicrobial prophylaxis. performing bronchoalveolar lavage may improve rate
of aetiological diagnosis, leading change therapeutic management and
improved outcomes. optimal length antibiotic therapy bacterial hap/vap
has well defined, perhaps longer general
population. mortality associated hap/vap high. hap/vap transplant
patients frequent associated increased mortality. room
for improvement gaining knowledge management hap/vap this
population.
