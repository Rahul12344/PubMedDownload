background: cd4(+) cell count, common hiv infection screening test, costly
and unable differentiate hiv monoinfection concurrent infection 
hepatitis b c virus. aimed ascertain diagnostic value serum adenosine
deaminase (ada) activity useful tool differentiate hiv mono- and
co-infection.
methods: blood samples collected 30 hiv-hbv 30 hiv-hcv coinfected
patients, 33 hiv positive subjects, 72 controls. cd4(+) cell count, serum
total ada (tada), ada1, ada2 isoenzyme activities determined and
their sensitivity specificity computed.
results: tada ada2 activities significantly higher cd4(+) counts
were markedly lower patients compared controls. strong inverse
agreements cd4(+) cell counts tada ada2 activities were
observed. serum tada ada1 activities showed highest specificity the
highest sensitivity, respectively, differentiating hiv monoinfection from
hiv-hbv hiv-hcv coinfections.
conclusions: showed strong agreement correlation cd4(+) cell count
and ada enzyme activity. based high ada sensitivity specificity, is
concluded determination ada activity might novel diagnostic tool 
distinguish hiv monoinfection coinfection hbv hcv.
