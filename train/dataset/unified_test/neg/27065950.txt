manipulation cell cycle commonly employed strategy viruses for
achieving favorable cellular environment infection. kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), primary etiological agent several
human malignancies including kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma,
encodes several oncoproteins deregulate normal physiology cell cycle
machinery persist endothelial cells b cells subsequently
establish latent infection. latency, small subset viral
proteins expressed. latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) one the
latent antigens shown essential transformation endothelial cells 
vitro. well demonstrated lana critical maintenance of
latency, episome dna replication, segregation gene transcription. this
review, summarize recent studies address lana functions an
oncoprotein steer host cell cycle-related events including proliferation and
apoptosis interacting various cellular viral factors, highlight
the potential therapeutic strategy disrupting lana-dependent signaling as
targets kshv-associated cancers.
