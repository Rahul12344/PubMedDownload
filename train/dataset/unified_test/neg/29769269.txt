the innate immunity critically important protection virus
infections, case rna viral infections, signaling mechanisms
that initiate robust protective innate immunity without triggering autoimmune
inflammation remain incompletely defined. study, found e3 ligase
trim29 specifically expressed poly i:c-stimulated human myeloid dendritic 
cells. induced trim29 played negative role type ifn production in
response poly i:c dsrna virus reovirus infection. importantly, the
challenge wild-type mice reovirus led lethal infection. contrast,
deletion trim29 protected mice developing lethality.
additionally, trim29-/- mice lower titers reovirus heart,
intestine, spleen, liver, brain elevated production type ifn.
mechanistically, trim29 shown interact mavs subsequently induce
its k11-linked ubiquitination degradation. taken together, trim29 regulates
negatively host innate immune response rna virus, could employed 
by rna viruses viral pathogenesis.
