human herpesviruses (hhvs) ubiquitous pathogens intermittently
reactivate latency. transmission believed facilitated their
frequent appearance saliva. study sought understand factors that
influence appearance viruses saliva examining prevalence, 
pattern, quantity eight hhvs saliva immunocompetent adults 
a history recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (hsv) infections following
dental treatment antiviral therapy. valacyclovir matched placebo given
(2 g twice day treatment 1 g twice following day) 125
patients randomized, double-blind controlled trial. saliva, collected the
day dental treatment 3 7 days later, analyzed using real-time
quantitative pcr. visits, hhvs coinfected saliva. course the
week, dnas hhv-6 hhv-7 detected significantly often (97% 
99% patients) epstein-barr virus (ebv; 64.8%), hsv-1 (13.0%), hhv-8
(3.2%), cytomegalovirus (2.4%), hsv-2 (0%), varicella-zoster virus (0%),
irrespective drug treatment (p < 0.002). mean genome copy numbers highest
for hsv-1 hhv-6. dental treatment influence asymptomatic viral
shedding patterns. however, valacyclovir treatment resulted significantly
fewer patients shedding ebv postoperative visits compared placebo (p
< 0.008). results suggest hhvs simultaneously present the
saliva healthy adults levels could facilitate transmission, and
valacyclovir therapy decreases prevalence ebv saliva little
effect hhv-6 hhv-7.
