aims: successive application negative staining transmission electron
microscopy (tem) tip-enhanced raman spectroscopy (ters) new correlative 
approach could used rapidly specifically detect identify
single pathogens including bioterrorism-relevant viruses complex samples. 
objective evaluate ters-compatibility commonly used electron
microscopy (em) grids (sample supports), chemicals negative staining
techniques and, required, devise appropriate alternatives.
methods results: phosphortungstic acid (pta) suitable heavy
metal stain, uranyl acetate, paraformaldehyde hepes buffer alcian blue are
unsuitable due relatively high raman scattering. moreover, low
thermal stability carbon-coated pioloform film copper grids (pioloform 
grids) negates utilization. silicon cantilever the
silver-coated atomic force microscope tip used record ters spectra suggested
that si-based grids might employed alternatives. evaluated
si-based tem grids, silicon nitride (sin) grid found best suited,
with almost background raman signals relevant spectral range, low
surface roughness good particle adhesion properties could further
improved glow discharge.
conclusions: charged sin grids excellent particle adhesion properties. the
use grids combination pta contrast tem suitable
for subsequent analysis ters.
significance impact study: study reports fundamental modifications
and optimizations negative staining em method allows combination
with near-field raman spectroscopy acquire spectroscopic signature from
nanoscale biological structures. facilitate precise diagnosis 
of single viral particles micro-organisms previously localized and
visualized tem.
