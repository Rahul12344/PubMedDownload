hiv co-infection significantly impacts natural history hepatitis c virus
(hcv) increasing plasma hcv viral load, accelerating liver disease
progression, reducing rates hcv clearance. cytokines play important
role regulating hepatic inflammation fibrogenesis chronic hcv
infection, yet impact hiv cytokine expression unknown. this
study, hcv continuous infection cell culture system modified permit
co-infection hiv test hypothesis virus-induced disregulation 
immune-response genes, particularly interferons tgf-β, may create a
permissive environment initial establishment hiv/hcv co-infection in
the host. ccr5-expressing huh-7.5 hepatoma cells transduced human cd4
antigen allow hiv infection vitro. co-infection cd4⁺ huh-7.5 cells 
hiv hcv co-culture hiv-infected cd4⁺ huh-7.5 cells hcv-infected
huh-7.5 cells increased level hcv rna compared hcv mono-infection.
quantitative gene expression analysis revealed hiv-induced regulation 
tested ifn family genes compared hcv co-infection. hcv infection
induced regulation many tgf family genes subsequently
down-regulated presence hiv hiv/hcv. interestingly, co-infection
resulted regulation several ifn genes significant regulation of
tgf-β genes leading overall enhancement hcv replication. data
suggest hiv infection may influence hcv replication vitro increasing
levels hcv rna, possibly differential regulation endogenous ifn
and tgf family genes.
