marine micro-organisms deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems considered
as potential sources bioactive natural products. sixteen bacterial strains
were isolated deep-sea hydrothermal field screened bioactive
metabolism studies. strains subjected bioactive testing at
different culture media, chemical dereplication hplc coupled to
high-resolution mass spectrometer performed analyse determine main 
secondary metabolisms strains. strain 06204 large-scale fermented
with relative optimal media, isolating desired sulphur compound.
butyrolactone 3-sulphate isolated structurally identified the
extract, guided dereplication showed moderate antivirus activities against
h3n2 ev71 viruses. study suggests deep-sea hydrothermal bacteria are
good sources sulphur natural products. meanwhile, described approach,
mainly bioactive screening, dereplication targeted isolation, effective
and efficient discover interesting bioactive compounds hydrothermal
bacteria.
