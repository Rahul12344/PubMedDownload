setting: busy urban hospital cameroon.
objectives: compare yield bacteriologically proven tuberculosis (tb)
cases examining two morning vs. three spot-morning-spot sputum specimens (mm vs. 
sms) direct microscopy acid-fast bacilli (afb).
design: repeated temporal cross-over mm sms sampling successive
tb suspects, using culture gold standard.
results: total 799 suspects screened using mm strategy, identifying
223 smear-positives, 808 suspects sms strategy, yielding 236
smear-positives. mm, 256 culture-positive, 195 (76%) were
smear-positive. sms, figures respectively 281 206 (73%), a
non-significant difference. mm sms strategies also detected respectively 
28 30 smear-positive cases confirmed culture. cases lost to
treatment either strategy.
conclusions: population high prevalence human immunodeficiency 
virus (hiv) late case presentation, smear microscopy two morning
specimens detected least many positive cases classical strategy, and
no cases lost treatment. two specimens initial tb suspect
screening thus recommended, also without excessive workload. comparative
studies populations presenting paucibacillary sputum needed to
determine equivalent quality yield alternative strategy two
spot specimens consultation.
