subpopulations spleen cells scrapie virus-infected mice used to
determine average virus content infected cells vivo time when
virus rapidly increasing titer lymphoreticular tissues. comparison of
the mean lethal doses lysed intact cells indicated averages 2 6
infectious units per infected cell. another experiment, preparations of
cytoplasmic nucleic acids extracted spleen cells infected mice no
detectable infectivity, suggests transmissible form virus
is free nucleic acid.
