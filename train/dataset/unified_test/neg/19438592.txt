we reported cxcl16, recently discovered transmembrane chemokine, is
expressed human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). however, known whether
hgf express cxcr6, receptor cxcl16, cxcl16 affects hgf biology. we
have shown hgf expressed cxcr6 reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction flow cytometric analysis. moreover, elucidated tumour
necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (cpg) dna
(toll-like receptor-9 ligand) treatment enhanced cxcr6 expression hgf.
interleukin (il)-4, il-13 cpg dna up-regulated cxcr6 expression by
tnf-alpha-stimulated hgf. hand, il-1beta interferon-gamma
inhibited cxcr6 expression tnf-alpha-treated hgf. cxcl16 treatment induced hgf
proliferation phosphorylation extracellular regulated kinase (erk) and
protein kinase b (akt) hgf. conclusion, hgf expressed cxcr6 functionally,
because cxcl16 induced hgf proliferation erk akt phosphorylation hgf. 
these results indicate cxcl16 may play important role pathogenesis
and remodelling periodontally diseased tissues.
