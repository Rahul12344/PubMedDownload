background: retrospective data suggest cryptococcal antigen (crag) screening
in patients late-stage human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) initiating
antiretroviral therapy (art) may reduce cryptococcal disease deaths.
prospective data limited.
methods: crag measured using lateral flow assays (lfa) latex
agglutination (la) tests 645 hiv-positive, art-naive patients cd4 counts 
≤100 cells/µl cape town, south africa. crag-positive patients offered
lumbar puncture (lp) treated antifungals. patients started art
between 2 4 weeks followed 1 year.
results: total 4.3% (28/645) patients crag positive serum and
plasma lfa. included 16 also positive urine lfa (2.5% total
screened) 7 serum la (1.1% total). 4 10 lfa-positive cases
agreeing lp, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) crag lfa positive. positive
csf crag associated higher screening plasma/serum lfa titers.among the
28 crag-positive patients, mortality 14.3% 10 weeks 25% 12 months. 
only 1 crag-positive patient, defaulted care, died cryptococcal
meningitis (cm). mortality crag-negative patients 11.5% 1 year. 2 
possible cm cases identified crag-negative patients.
conclusions: crag screening individuals initiating art preemptive
fluconazole treatment crag-positive patients resulted markedly fewer cases 
of cm compared historic unscreened cohorts. studies needed refine
management crag-positive patients high mortality appear
to wholly attributable cryptococcal disease.
