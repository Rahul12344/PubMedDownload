ribavirin (rbv) elderly patients cirrhosis compared younger patients.

results: 270 patients enrolled study, compensated cirrhosis, 
133 (49.2%) ≥65 years age. sustained virological response 12 weeks
(svr12) achieved 94.2% (129/137) aged <65 years 97.7%
(130/133) ≥65 years. diabetes common comorbidity in
patients ≥65 years compared younger patients (26.3% vs 12.4% p<.003). most
common adverse event (ae) elderly patients grade 2 anaemia (35.3% vs
