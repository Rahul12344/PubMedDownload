we aimed investigate influence regulatory cells including cd4+cd25+, 
cd8+cd28- hepatitis b virus (hbv) genotype sustained virological response 
and tolerance nucleoside drugs. one hundred thirty-seven patients were
enrolled. lamivudine administered 84 patients. entecavir administered 
to 53 patients. treatment, biochemical tests, hbv dna load, hbv 
serum level, hbv genotype, pb cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, cd4+cd25+/cd3+, and
cd8+cd28-/cd3+ frequencies measured. based hbv dna loads 4 weeks of
therapy, patients divided response group suboptimal response group.
the lamivudine group received treatment continuously, patients were
categorized non-resistance group resistance group. compared the
suboptimal response resistance groups lamivudine, cd4+cd25+/cd3+ levels
were higher response non-resistance groups (t=4.372, p=0.046; t=7.262,
p=0.017). non-resistance group, cd8+cd28-/cd3+ frequency lower in
the resistance group (t=5.527, p=0.037). virus load hepatitis b e antigen
(hbeag)-positive rate significantly lower response and
resistance group (t=2.164, p=0.038; x2=4.239, p=0.040; t=2.015, p=0.044; x2=16.2,
p=0.000). incidence drug resistance high patients virogene type c.
for virological response entecavir, cd8+cd28-/cd3+ level significantly
lower suboptimal response group (t=6.283, p=0.036). response and
suboptimal response groups compared cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, cd4+cd25+/cd3+ 
virus genotype, differences statistically significant (p>0.05).
baseline regulatory cells including cd4+cd25+/cd3+ cd8+cd28-/cd3+
frequencies relationship incidence rapid virological response 
and resistance nucleoside drugs. patients hbv genotype c receiving
lamivudine often underwent drug resistance. antiviral efficacy the
resistance lamivudine closely correlated baseline factors; 
cannot found entecavir.
