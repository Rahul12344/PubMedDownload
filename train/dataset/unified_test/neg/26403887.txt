recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 3b (raav3b) transduce cultured
human liver cancer cells primary human hepatocytes efficiently. serine (s)-
and threonine (t)-directed capsid modifications augment transduction 
efficiency. systemically delivered capsid-optimized raav3b vectors can
specifically target cancer cells human liver cancer xenograft model,
suggesting potential use human liver-directed gene therapy. here, we
compared transduction efficiencies aav3b aav8 vectors cultured primary 
human hepatocytes cancer cells well human mouse hepatocytes a
human liver xenograft nsg-piz mouse model. also examined safety and
transduction efficacy wild-type (wt) capsid-optimized raav3b livers
of nonhuman primates (nhps). intravenously delivered s663v+t492v (st)-modified
self-complementary (sc) aav3b-egfp vectors led liver-targeted robust enhanced 
green fluorescence protein (egfp) expression nhps without apparent
hepatotoxicity. intravenous injections wt st-modified raav3b.st-rhcg 
vectors also generated stable super-physiological levels rhesus chorionic
gonadotropin (rhcg) nhps. vector genome predominantly targeted liver. 
clinical chemistry histopathology examinations showed apparent
vector-related toxicity. studies important informative for
clinical development optimized aav3b vectors human liver-directed gene
therapy.
