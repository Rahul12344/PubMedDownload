objective: aids frequently associates certain malignancies, including
kaposi's sarcoma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl), anogenital neoplasia. this
study aimed define frequency infection human herpesvirus (hhv)-8 
throughout spectrum aids-related neoplasia europe.
design: tumour panel representative distinct types aids-related
neoplasms tested presence hhv-8 dna sequences. autologous
uninvolved tissues also tested selected cases.
methods: presence hhv-8 dna sequences assayed combination of
polymerase chain reaction followed oligohybridization southern blot
hybridization genomic dna hhv-8-specific probe.
results: hhv-8 sequences detected 100% aids-related kaposi's sarcoma
(all 35 cases). among aids-related nhl, hhv-8 sequences selectively clustered
with body-cavity-based lymphomas (bcbl; three cases), although were
consistently negative small non-cleaved cell lymphomas (none 18 cases),
diffuse large cell lymphomas (none seven), anaplastic large cell lymphomas 
(none three). hhv-8 sequences found cases anogenital neoplasia
(out 14) hodgkin's disease (out three). hhv-8 dna sequences also
positive uninvolved skin six aids-related kaposi's sarcoma
patients, circulating lymphocytes bcbl patient. positivity
for hhv-8 sequences occurred patients belonging major aids risk
categories.
conclusions: data confirm hhv-8 sequences associate high frequency 
with selected types aids-related neoplasia, namely kaposi's sarcoma bcbl, 
although consistently absent types aids-nhl aids-related
anogenital neoplasia.
