objective: investigate relationship failure prevention of
hepatitis b virus mother-to-child transmission hbv serological pattern, viral
load well hbv genotypes.
methods: 2765 pairs mother-infant matched samples collected. these
pregnant women hbsag positive delivered hospital january 1st,
2011 june 30th, 2011. samples, 26 pairs sera samples randomly
selected 114 pairs samples failed prevention hepatitis b 
virus mother-to-child transmission. serological tests, viral load genotype
detection performed analysis. additionally, selected
subjects followed tested 2014.
results: hbeag positive rates 76.92% 69.23% mother group infant
group respectively, showed statistical difference. average hbv dna levels 
were >2×105iu/ml mother group infant group. genotype analysis
revealed 11 pairs mother-infant matched samples belonged c gene type
and another 11 pairs b gene type. different genotypes observed 4
pairs mother-infant matched samples.
conclusion: hbeag positive high hbv dna level two major risk factors 
hbv mother child transmission. additionally, nosocomial infection another 
potential way hbv vertical transmission, especially remote area yunnan
province.
