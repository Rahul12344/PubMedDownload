the yellow mosaic viruses (ymv) infecting legumes considered most
devastating begomoviruses incite considerable yield loss. yellow
discoloration pods seeds infected plants symptom emergence the
very first trifoliate leaf plants field suggestive the
virus may seed borne, investigated present study. the
distribution virus various parts seeds black gram (vigna
mungo l. hepper) plants naturally infected field determined by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr), southern blot analysis, sequencing.
nucleotide sequencing pcr amplicons seed parts groups ten
seeds revealed presence mung bean yellow mosaic virus (mymv) seed
coat, cotyledon, embryonic axes. presence virion particles was
confirmed double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(das-elisa) immunosorbent electron microscopy (isem) even single whole
seed. confocal microscopy, positive fluorescent signals obtained using
coat protein gene-specific primers embryonic axes. however, growth 
tests performed batch seeds, symptom development in
the seedlings though virus (both dna b components) detected 32 %
of tested seedlings. study, mymv detected seed coat,
cotyledon, embryo. study revealed mymv seed-borne virus.
