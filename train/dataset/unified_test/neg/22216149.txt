background: vaccine needed control spread human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1). vitro assay predict protection induced
by vaccine would facilitate development vaccine. potential
candidate would assay quantify neutralization hiv-1.
methods findings: used sera rhesus macaques been
immunized hiv candidate vaccines subsequently challenged simian
human immunodeficiency virus (shiv). compared neutralization assays with
different formats. experiments standardized validated tzmbl
assay, neutralizing antibody titers homologous shiv(sf162p4) pseudovirus 
gave variable correlation reductions plasma viremia levels. target 
cells used assays passive indicators virus infection but
are actively involved neutralization process. replicating virus was
used ghost cell assays, events absorption phase, well the
incubation phase, determine level neutralization. sera associated
with protection properties closest traditional concept of
neutralization: concentration antibody present absorption phase
has effect inactivation rate. ghost assays, events the
absorption phase may inactivate fixed number, rather proportion, of
virus complete neutralization obtained, found
at low doses particularly isolates relatively resistant to
neutralization.
conclusions: two scenarios potential predict protection by
neutralizing antibodies concentrations induced vaccination:
antibodies properties close traditional concept of
neutralization may protect range challenge doses neutralization
sensitive hiv isolates; window opportunity also exists protection
against isolates resistant neutralization low
challenge doses.
