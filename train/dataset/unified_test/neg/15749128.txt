here, evaluate cell responses raised hiv-1 clade b dna/mva
vaccine recognition hiv-1 circulating recombinant form (crf) ag gag
sequence (crf-02). cross-clade activity ag sequence better
conserved cd8 cd4 cells. cd8 cells exhibited 75% conservation for
height 83% conservation breadth, whereas cd4 responses exhibited 45%
conservation height 50% conservation breadth. five cd8 epitopes 8
cd4 epitopes mapped. three 5 cd8 epitopes 2 8 cd4 epitopes
were conserved across multiple hiv-1 clades. impressively, cd8
epitopes half cd4 epitopes reported human infections.
our results demonstrate clade b dna/mva hiv vaccine elicits cell
responses epitopes conserved multiple clades recognized
by humans macaques.
