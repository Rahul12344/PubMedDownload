we previously constructed recombinant luiii parvovirus genome lacking viral
coding sequences used generate luciferase-transducing virions, by
cotransfection cells helper plasmid expressing luiii viral proteins.
here, describe similar cotransfections using alternative,
replication-defective helpers encoding non-structural capsid proteins 
parvovirus h1, either fibrotropic lymphotropic parvovirus strain 
minute virus mice [mvm(p) mvm(i)]. cotransfection generated
transducing virus directed luciferase expression infection hela
cells. transducing activity virus produced using either luiii h1 helper
plasmids could specifically neutralized antiserum raised the
corresponding infectious virus. recombinant luiii parvovirus was
pseudotyped mvm(p) mvm(i), resulting virions efficiently expressed
luciferase infection human murine cells known permissive for
both mvm strains. mvm(p) pseudotyped virus also expressed reporter
efficiently infected murine a9 fibroblast line. contrast, the
recombinant virus generated mvm(i) helper gave luciferase expression that
was barely detectable infection a9 cells highly restrictive
for mvm(i) productive infection. results support notion the
allotropic determinant mvm strains functions capsid
proteins. pseudotyping recombinant parvovirus genomes useful in
controlling host range vectors, studying mechanisms influencing
the permissiveness parvovirus infections.
