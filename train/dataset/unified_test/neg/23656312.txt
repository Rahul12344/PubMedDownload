association dna virus grapevines affected red blotch disease in
california.

al rwahnih m, dave a, anderson mm, rowhani a, uyemoto jk, sudarshana mr.

in napa valley california, vineyards 'cabernet franc' (cf) clone 214,
'cabernet sauvignon' clone 337, 'zinfandel' clone 1a (z1a) grapevines
exhibiting foliar symptoms red blotches, marginal reddening, red veins
that accompanied reduced sugar accumulation fruit harvest were
initially suspected infected leafroll-associated viruses. however,
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests negative all
known leafroll-associated viruses, exception grapevine
leafroll-associated virus 2 z1a. metagenomic analysis cdna libraries
obtained double-stranded rna enriched nucleic acid (na) preparations from
bark scrapings dormant canes illumina platform revealed sequences having
a distant relationship members family geminiviridae. sequencing of
products obtained pcr assays using overlapping primers rolling circle
amplification (rca) confirmed presence single circular genome 3,206
nucleotides nearly identical genome recently reported
grapevine cabernet franc-associated virus found declining grapevines new
york. propose call virus "grapevine red blotch-associated virus"
(grbav) describe association grapevine red blotch disease. primers
specific grbav amplified product expected size (557 bp) na
preparations obtained petioles several diseased source vines. chip bud
inoculations successfully transmitted grbav test plants cf, confirmed by
pcr analysis. first report dna virus associated red blotch 
disease grapevines california.
