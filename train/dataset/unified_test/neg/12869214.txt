cytomegalovirus (cmv) number interesting properties qualifies as
a vector gene transfer. especially appealing ability cmv genome
to persist hematopoietic progenitor cells packaging capacity the
viral capsid accommodates dna genome 230 kbp. order exploit the
packaging capacity cmv capsid investigated whether principles an
amplicon vector applied cmv. amplicons herpesviral vectors, which
contain cis-active sequences required replication packaging of
the vector genome. construction cmv amplicon sequences comprising
the lytic origin replication (orilyt) cleavage packaging recognition
sites (pac) human cmv cloned onto plasmid. gene encoding green
fluorescent protein used model transgene. amplicon plasmid
replicated presence cmv helper virus packaged cmv
particles, replication packaging dependent presence 
orilyt pac sequences. packaged amplicon could transferred recipient
cells reisolated transduced cells. analysis dna isolated from
cmv capsids revealed cmv amplicon packaged concatemer a
size approximately 210 kbp. cmv amplicon vector potential to
transfer therapeutic genes size 200 kbp thus provides a
unique transfer capacity among viral vectors.
