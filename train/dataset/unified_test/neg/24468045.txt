purpose: determine differences patient characteristics outcomes
after transarterial chemoembolization different viral etiologies of
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).
methods: retrospective study consisted 201 patients undergoing first-time
transarterial chemoembolization unresectable hcc january december
2009. patients divided four groups: hepatitis b virus (hbv) (n
= 104), hepatitis c virus (hcv) (n = 63), hbv hcv (n = 10), viral
hepatitis (n = 24). clinical laboratory data obtained from
electronic medical records, imaging findings obtained transarterial
chemoembolization analyzed. kaplan-meier analyses used assess the
impact hbv hcv status, clinical characteristics, imaging results on
overall survival.
results: median follow-up 28.3 months ± 16.2, 1-, 2-, 3-year
overall survival rates 74.1%, 59.7%, 53.2%. patients hbv a
significant association younger age (p = .001), higher male-to-female ratio 
(p = .003), lower alanine aminotransferase levels (p = .018), higher albumin
levels (p = .009), multifocal tumors diagnosis (p = .04) compared with
patients hcv. patients hbv hcv significantly higher serum 
bilirubin levels compared groups (p = .002). significant
difference found overall survival among different hepatitis groups (p 
= .943). multivariate analysis showed statistically significant determinants
for overall survival child-pugh class (p = .002), barcelona clinic liver
cancer stage (p < .001), tumor size (p < .001), distribution (p < .001).
conclusions: viral etiology correlation outcome patients 
hcc undergoing transarterial chemoembolization.
