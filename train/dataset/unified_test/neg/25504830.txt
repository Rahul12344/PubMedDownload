we report case human herpes virus-8-associated multicentric castleman's
disease hiv-positive patient hyponatraemia. 65-year-old man was
admitted relapsing remitting fever, scattered skin eruptions and
hepatosplenomegaly following combination antiretroviral therapy hiv
infection. based histopathological findings, diagnosed human 
herpes virus-8-associated multicentric castleman's disease treated with
four-weekly infusions rituximab. prior receiving chemotherapy, observed 
several suspected biomarkers disease activity, positive correlations between
plasma human herpes virus-8 viral load levels plasma interleukin-6,
c-reactive protein soluble interleukin-2 receptor, negative correlations 
between platelet count, albumin levels especially serum sodium levels. we
hypothesize non-osmotic release plasma antidiuretic hormone cause of
hyponatraemia human herpes virus-8-associated multicentric castleman's disease
and relapsing remitting hyponatraemia could correlated plasma
human herpes virus-8 viral load.
