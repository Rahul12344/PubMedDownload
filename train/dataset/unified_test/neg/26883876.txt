natural killer (nk) cells primary effectors innate immune response
against virus-infected cells cells undergone malignant
transformation. nk cells recognize targets complex array of
activating inhibitory receptors, regulate intensity effector
response individual target cells. however, many studies shown that
tumor cells escape immune cell recognition variety mechanisms,
developing resistance nk cell killing. using lentiviral shrna library, we
previously demonstrated several common signaling pathways modulate
susceptibility tumor cells nk cell activity. study, focused on
one genes (pi3kcb), identified genetic screen. pi3kcb gene
encodes isoform catalytic subunit pi3k called p110β. pi3k
pathway linked diverse cellular functions, never been
associated susceptibility nk cell activity. gene silencing pi3kcb
resulted increased susceptibility several tumor cell lines nk cell lytic
activity induced increased ifn-γ secretion nk cells. treatment primary 
tumor cells two different pi3k inhibitors also increased target cell
susceptibility nk cell activity. effects due, least part, to
modulation several activating inhibitory ligands appear be
correlated pi3k signaling pathway inhibition. findings identify new 
and important role pi3kcb modulating tumor cell susceptibility nk cells 
and open way future combined target immunotherapies.
