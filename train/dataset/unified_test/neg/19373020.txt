purpose review: highlight promising areas research preview future
generations microbicides, review focus reports described new
cellular viral targets, drug substances, strategies specifically
intended topical microbicides. reports dealt design,
discovery, synthesis anti-hiv agents use oral parenteral
formulations, important microbicide field, beyond scope 
this review.
recent findings: drug substances intended topical microbicides becoming
increasingly target specific and, structurally, complex. new production
methods might reduce cost microbicides contain complex
molecules. genetically engineered probiotic vaginal bacteria express even
wider range antiviral compounds, perhaps resulting uninterrupted, coitally 
independent protection. combination microbicides contain two drug
substances frequently act synergistically. discovery new cellular targets 
such syndecan-3 might lead effective microbicides.
summary: future generations microbicides likely contain one more
complex highly specific drug substances, resulting safer effective
products. since compliance issues continue confound hiv herpes simplex
virus trials, efforts bring practical, coitally independent microbicides to
developing countries become top priority.
