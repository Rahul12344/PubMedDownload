interleukin-24 (il-24) cytokine encoded tumor suppressor gene the
il-10 family, also known melanoma differentiation associated gene-7
(mda-7) first discovered human melanoma cells. mda-7/il-24 shown 
to inhibit proliferation various human tumor cell lines, effect on
the sensitivity b cell lymphoma chemotherapy agents yet clear. the
present study investigated effects mda-7/il-24 overexpression the
sensitivity human b cell lymphoma cells chemotherapy, well its
mechanism action. sensitivity stable mda-7/il-24 overexpressing raji
and daudi cells cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cddp), epirubicin and
vinblastine (vcr) assessed mts method, ic50 value calculated.
cell apoptosis intracellular accumulation rhodamine-123 assayed
by flow cytometry. expression multidrug resistance gene 1 (mdr1),
b-cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (bmi1),
topoisomerase ii (topo ii) multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (mrp1) mrna
and protein analyzed reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (rt-qpcr) western blotting, respectively. addition, western blot 
analysis also used investigate effect mda-7/il-24 activity of
gtp-rhoa-erk signaling pathway raji daudi cells. growth inhibition and
apoptosis rates mda-7/il-24 overexpressing raji daudi cells higher
than non-transfected cells cells transfected vector alone 
treated cddp, epirubicin vcr. ic50 values cddp, epirubicin and
vcr lower mda-7/il-24-overexpressing raji daudi cells for
non-transfected cells cells transfected empty vector. intracellular
accumulation rhodamine-123 expression topo ii higher, while
the levels mdr1, bmi mrp1 mrna protein lower, mda-7/il-24
overexpressing raji daudi cells. furthermore, activities gtp-rhoa-erk 
signaling pathway raji daudi cells suppressed. results
indicated mda-7/il-24 enhanced sensitivity b lymphoma cells to
chemotherapy agents altering expression multidrug-resistance genes via 
downregulating gtp-rhoa-erk signaling pathway, suggesting treatment b
cell lymphomas mda-7/il-24 could avoid mdr.
