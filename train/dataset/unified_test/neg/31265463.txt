mathematical models used successfully diverse scales biological
organization, ranging ecology population dynamics stochastic reaction
events occurring individual molecules single cells. generally, many
biological processes unfold across multiple scales, mutations best
studied example stochasticity molecular scale influence
outcomes population scale. many contexts, however, analogous
link micro- macro-scale remains elusive, primarily due the
challenges involved setting analyzing multi-scale models. here, we
employ model investigate stochasticity propagates individual

bacterial populations shaped activities immunity-conferring enzymes
in single cells ecological consequences imply optimal bacterial
defense strategies viruses. results suggest bacterial
populations presence viruses either optimize initial growth
rate population size, first strategy favoring simple immunity
featuring single restriction modification system second strategy
favoring complex bacterial innate immunity featuring several simultaneously
active restriction modification systems.
