analysis protooncogene rna expression marrow stromal cells long-term
marrow culture demonstrated high levels c-abl 5-, 6-, 7-kilobase (kb) rna 
transcripts. experiments three independently derived simian virus
40-transformed marrow stromal cell lines, expression c-abl
transcripts increased response recombinant tumor necrosis
factor alpha (1000 units/ml) interleukin 1 alpha (10 units/ml). although
lymphocyte-conditioned medium predominantly up-regulated 5-kb transcript,
interleukin 1 alpha primarily affected 6-kb transcript. up-regulation 
the 5-kb c-abl message correlated up-regulation the
granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor transcript down-regulation
of procollagen transcripts transformed cells. data suggest c-abl 
plays roles regulation extracellular matrix expression the
