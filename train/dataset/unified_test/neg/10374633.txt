aim: construct inducible nitric-oxide synthase (inos) gene transferring
vector mediated retrovirus.
methods: recombinant dna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification
techniques used.
results: 2 steps molecular cloning, full-length cdna encoding
macrophage inos isolated plasmid pksinos subcloned intermediate
vector psp72, adjusting restriction enzyme sites 5'- 3'-flanking 
ends insert fragment. retroviral vector plncxinos contains inos
coding region, cytomegalovirus promoter neomycin resistance (neor) gene was
further constructed. authenticity insertion size orientation inos
sequence verified restriction mapping pcr analysis inos
gene-specific primers.
conclusion: retroviral expression vector carrying inos fragment obtained,
which provides material establish model inos gene-modified neurons.
