'candidatus liberibacter asiaticus' causal agent citrus huanglongbing, 
the serious disease citrus worldwide. developed applied
immunization affinity screening methods develop primary library of
recombinant single chain variable fragment (scfv) antibodies m13 vector,
pkm19. antibody population enriched antibodies bind antigens of
'ca. liberibacter asiaticus'. primary library 10(7) unique
antibodies genes encode them. screened library for
antibodies bind specifically-chosen proteins present the
surface 'ca. liberibacter asiaticus'. proteins used targets 
affinity-based selection scfvs bind major outer membrane protein, 
ompa; polysaccharide capsule protein kpsf; protein component type iv
pilus (capf); and, two flagellar proteins flha flgi. scfvs been
used elisa dot blot assays purified protein antigens 'ca.
liberibacter asiaticus' infected plant extracts. also recloned many of
these scfvs plasmid expression vector designed production of
scfvs. screening scfvs efficient phage-bound, rather 
soluble scfvs, used. demonstrated technology produce antibodies
at protein target encoded 'ca. liberibacter asiaticus'.
applications could include advanced diagnostic methods huanglongbing 
development immune labeling reagents planta applications.
