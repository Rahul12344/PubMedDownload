japanese encephalitis virus (jev), flavivirus maintained zoonotic cycle
and transmitted mosquito culex tritaeniorhynchus, causes epidemics of
encephalitis throughout much asia. resident populations, including short- or
long-term visitors enzootic regions, risk infection disease. for
the past several decades, killed viral vaccines prepared tissue culture or
mouse brain used effectively immunize travelers residents of
enzootic countries. cost, efficacy safety concerns led development 
a live-attenuated virus vaccine (sa14-14-2) recently, licensure
in usa, europe, canada, australia purified inactivated, tissue
culture-based japanese encephalitis vaccine (ixiaro(®), referred ic51;
intercell ag, vienna, austria). addition, live-attenuated yellow
fever-japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine (imojev™, referred japanese
encephalitis-cv; sanofi pasteur, lyon, france) recently licensed australia
and review thailand. broad portfolio safe effective japanese
encephalitis vaccines become available meet needs at-risk
populations; appropriately delivered, new vaccines greatly
diminish burden disease.
