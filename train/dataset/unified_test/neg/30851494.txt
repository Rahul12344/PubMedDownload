early diagnosis dengue biomarkers employing technology less
labor- time-intensive offers higher sensitivity lower limits of
detection would find great significance developing world. here, report 
the development biosensor exploits localized surface plasmon
resonance (lspr) effect silver nanostructures, created via thermal annealing
of thin metal film, detect dengue ns1 antigen, appears early the
onset infection. biosensor integrates membrane-based blood-plasma
separation develop lab-on-chip device facilitates rapid diagnosis (within
30 min) dengue ns1 antigen small volume (10 µl) whole blood. the
refractive index (ri) sensitivity lspr biosensor verified using
aqueous glycerol (0-100 wt%) showed sufficiently sensitive to
detect 10-3 change ri, comparable observed with
protein-protein interaction. ri sensitivity utilized demonstrate
protein binding using bovine serum albumin detection antibody-antigen
immune reaction binding human chorionic gonadotropin antigen immunoglobulin
antibody immobilized lspr biosensor. next, demonstrated detection
of ns1 plasma obtained via centrifugation plasma separated on-chip.
from 10 µl whole blood spiked ns1 antigen, biosensor reliably detects
0.06 µg/ml ns1, lies within clinical limit observed first
seven days infection, sensitivity 9 nm/(µg/ml). results
confirm proposed lspr biosensor potentially used point-of-care
dengue diagnostics.
