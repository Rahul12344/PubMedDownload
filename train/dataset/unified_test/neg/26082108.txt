numerous monoclonal antibodies (mabs) recognize neutralize infectious
pathogens isolated developed years. fact that
infectious diseases involve large populations infected individuals an
important factor motivated search cost-effective and
scalable methods antibody production. current technologies production 
of antibodies plants allow rapid expression evaluation can
also readily scaled multikilogram production runs. addition, recent
progress manipulating glycosylation plant production systems allowed
for evaluation antibodies containing glycans nearly homogeneous, 
are mammalian structure, enhanced neutralizing capabilities. among
the anti-infectious disease antibodies produced plants are
included intended prevention treatment anthrax, clostridium
perfringens, ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus,
rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, staphylococcal enterotoxin, west nile virus,
and tooth decay. animal human efficacy data mabs discussed.
