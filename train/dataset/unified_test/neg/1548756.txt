endogenous retrovirus-related sequences exist within normal genomic dna of
all eukaryotes, endogenous sequences shown important to
the nature biology related exogenous retroviruses may also play role
in cellular functions. date, endogenous sequences related human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) reported. herein describe 
first report presence nucleotide sequences related hiv-1 human,
chimpanzee, rhesus monkey dnas normal uninfected individuals. also
present isolation characterization two endogenous
hiv-1-related sequences, ehs-1 ehs-2. use low-stringency southern
blot hybridization, complex banding patterns detected human dna 5'
and 3' hiv-1-derived probes. hiv-1 env region probe used, detected
a less complex, conserved banding pattern human dna well related but
distinct banding pattern chimpanzee rhesus monkey dnas. ehs-1 -2 
cloned normal human genomic dna libraries using env region probe.
clone ehs-1 shows sequence similarity domain envelope cellular
protease cleavage site hiv-1, ehs-2 sequence similarity the
overlapping reading frame rev gp41. stringent hybridization ehs-1 back
to primate genomic dna indicates two distinct ehs-1 loci normal human dna, 
identical band pattern chimpanzee dna, single locus rhesus monkey
dna. likewise, ehs-2 present single highly conserved locus three
species. oligonucleotide derived ehs-2 across region near identity
to hiv-1 detects complex banding pattern primates tested similar that
seen 3' hiv-1 probe. data suggest hiv-1-related
sequences identified primate dna share common core nucleic acid sequence 
found ehs-2 rev hiv-1-related sequences have
additional larger regions sequence similarity hiv-1.
