limited data exist use acute-phase proteins predictors of
hiv-related outcomes. examined relationship postpartum α(1)-acid
glycoprotein (agp) concentrations hiv-related maternal mortality,
mother-to-child transmission, hiv-free survival among 643 zimbabwean women.
elevated agp significantly associated 5.74-fold (p = 0.001) increased 
risk maternal death, 2.39-fold (p = 0.033) increased risk postnatal
transmission, marginally significant 1.85-fold (p = 0.087) increased risk
of infant infection death. resource-limited setting, agp may of
utility inexpensive prognostic tool hiv-infected individuals.
