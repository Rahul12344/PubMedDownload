adenoviral vectors, encoding genes cell surface antigens receptors, have
been used induce high level expression tumor cells vitro in
vivo. induced antigens receptors targeted radiolabeled
antibodies peptides potential radiotherapeutic applications. purpose
of study determine dosing schema adenoviral vector encoding
the human somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (adcmvhsstr2) achieving highest
tumor localization [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide, binds this
receptor, human ovarian cancer model prelude future therapy studies.
adcmvhsstr2 produced used induce hsstr2 a427 human nonsmall cell
lung cancer cells skov3.ipl human ovarian cancer cells vitro, as
demonstrated competitive binding assays using [125i]-tyr1-somatostatin and
[(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide. mice bearing i.p. skov3.ip1 tumors administered
1 x 10(9) plaque-forming units adcmvhsstr2 i.p. 5 days tumor cell
inoculation, followed i.p. injection [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide 2 
days later, showed range 15.3-60.4% median injected dose/gram (id/g) in
tumor 4 h injection compared 3.5% id/g when
[125i]-tyr1-somatostatin administered 0.3% id/g negative control
peptide [125i]-mip-bombesin administered. mice administered control
adenoviral vector encoding gastrin-releasing peptide receptor have
tumor localization [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide (<1.6% id/g),
demonstrating specificity [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide adcmvhsstr2
induced tumor cells. another set experiments, tumor localization of
[(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide different 1, 2, 4 days after
adcmvhsstr2 injection (31.8, 37.7, 40.7% id/g, respectively; p = 0.88),
indicating multiple injections radiolabeled peptide administered
with equivalent uptake 4-day period. [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide
tumor localization animals administered adcmvhsstr2 consecutive days 2
days apart 22.4% id/g 53.2% id/g, respectively (p = 0.009) when
[(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide given 1 day second adcmvhsstr2
injection. difference [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide
localization single adcmvhsstr2 injection (40.7% id/g) two injections 
of adcmvhsstr2 given 1 (45.9% id/g) 2 (53.2% id/g) days apart, where
[(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide given case 4 days first
adcmvhsstr2 injection (p = 0.65). therefore, two adcmvhsstr2 injections not
increase [(111)in]-dtpa-d-phe1-octreotide tumor localization compared one
injection, eliminates concerns immune response second dose of
adcmvhsstr2. basis therapeutic protocol multiple
administrations octreotide analogue labeled therapeutic
