objective: aimed evaluate effectiveness adaptive working memory
(wm) training (wmt) program, corresponding neural correlates, and
lmx1a-rs4657412 polymorphism adaptive wmt, human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) participants compared seronegative (sn) controls.
methods: total 201 206 qualified participants completed baseline
assessments randomization 25 sessions adaptive wmt nonadaptive
wmt. total 74 76 (34 hiv, 42 sn) completed adaptive wmt 40
completed nonadaptive wmt (20 hiv, 20 sn) assessed 1 month, 55
adaptive wmt participants also assessed 6 months. nontrained
near-transfer wm tests (digit-span, spatial-span), self-reported executive
functioning, functional magnetic resonance images 1-back 2-back
tasks performed baseline follow-up visit, lmx1a-rs4657412
was genotyped participants.
results: although hiv participants slightly lower cognitive performance and
start index sn baseline, groups improved improvement index (>30%;
false discovery rate [fdr] corrected p < 0.0008) nontrained wm tests after
adaptive wmt (fdr corrected, p ≤ 0.001), nonadaptive wmt (training 
by training type corrected, p = 0.01 p = 0.05) 1 month later. hiv participants
(especially lmx1a-g carriers) also poorer self-reported executive functioning
than sn, groups reported improvements adaptive wmt (global:
training fdr corrected, p = 0.004), hiv participants improved after
nonadaptive wmt. hiv participants also greater frontal activation sn 
baseline, brain activation decreased groups 1 6 months after
adaptive wmt (fdr corrected, p < 0.0001), normalization brain activation 
in hiv participants, especially lmx1a-aa carriers (lmx1a genotype hiv
status, cluster-corrected-p < 0.0001).
interpretation: adaptive wmt, nonadaptive wmt, improved wm performance in
both sn hiv participants, accompanied decreased normalized brain
activation suggest improved neural efficiency, especially hiv-lmx1a-aa
carriers might greater dopaminergic reserve. findings suggest that
adaptive wmt may effective adjunctive therapy wm deficits hiv
participants. ann neurol 2017;81:17-34.
