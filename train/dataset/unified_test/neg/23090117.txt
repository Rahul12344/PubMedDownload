natural killer (nk) cell clearance tumor cell emboli following surgery is
thought vital preventing postoperative metastases. using mouse model
of surgical stress, transferred surgically stressed nk cells nk-deficient
mice observed enhanced lung metastases tumor-bearing mice compared with
mice received untreated nk cells. results establish nk cells play
a crucial role mediating tumor clearance following surgery. surgery markedly
reduced nk cell total numbers spleen affected nk cell migration. ex
vivo vivo tumor cell killing nk cells significantly reduced in
surgically stressed mice. furthermore, secreted tissue signals and
myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations altered surgically stressed
mice. significantly, perioperative administration oncolytic parapoxvirus ovis 
(orfv) vaccinia virus reverse nk cell suppression, correlates 
a reduction postoperative formation metastases. human studies,
postoperative cancer surgery patients reduced nk cell cytotoxicity, we
show first time oncolytic vaccinia virus markedly increases nk cell 
activity patients cancer. data provide direct vivo evidence that
surgical stress impairs global nk cell function. perioperative therapies aimed at
enhancing nk cell function reduce metastatic recurrence improve survival
in surgical cancer patients.
