background: drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (dihs) severe multiorgan 
systemic reaction. numerous studies linked reactivation human herpesvirus
(hhv)-6 development dihs. recent articles suggested that
reactivation herpesviruses besides hhv-6 might also involved the
development dihs. hand, recent studies provided evidence for
a role reactivation various herpesviruses development of
graft-versus-host disease (gvhd).
objectives: attempted determine whether sequential herpesvirus reactivation
could detected four patients severe dihs, observed patients with
gvhd, coincident various clinical manifestations developed after
discontinuation causative drugs.
methods: detection quantification viral dna [cytomegalovirus (cmv),
epstein-barr virus (ebv), hhv-6 hhv-7] sequential blood samples were
performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, based taqman
technology.
results: patients, cascade virus reactivation initiated hhv-6 
or ebv extended ebv hhv-7, eventually cmv. clinical manifestations
of syndrome followed failure various organs occurring despite
discontinuation drug coincident herpesvirus reactivations.
conclusions: results suggest various herpesviruses reactivate in
the setting severe drug reactions similar sequential order that
described gvhd. sequential reactivation herpesviruses is
responsible development multiorgan failure occurring after
discontinuation causative drug.
