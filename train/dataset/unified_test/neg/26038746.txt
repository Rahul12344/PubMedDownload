in 2010, large outbreak rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred alice
springs region northern territory, australia. outbreak occurred 43
months introduction g1p[8] rotavirus vaccine rotarix(速).
forty-three infants hospitalized outbreak analysis fecal
samples infant revealed g1p[8] rotavirus strain. outbreak strain 
was adapted cell culture neutralization assays performed using vp7
and vp4 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. outbreak strain exhibited a
distinct neutralization resistance pattern compared rotarix(速) vaccine
strain. whole genome sequencing 2010 outbreak virus strain demonstrated
numerous amino acid differences compared rotarix(速) vaccine strain 
characterized neutralization epitopes vp7 vp4 proteins. phylogenetic
analysis outbreak strain revealed close genetic relationship global
strains, particular rva/human-wt/bel/be0098/2009/g1p[8] and
rva/human-wt/bel/be00038/2008/g1p[8] numerous genes. 2010 outbreak strain
was likely introduced globally circulating population strains rather
than evolving endemic australian strain. outbreak strain possessed
antigenic differences vp7 vp4 proteins compared rotarix(速)
vaccine strain. outbreak associated moderate vaccine coverage and
possibly low vaccine take population.
