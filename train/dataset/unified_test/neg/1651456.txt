background: syndrome progressive muscular atrophy decades acute
paralytic poliomyelitis (post-polio syndrome) well understood. theory 
that physiologic changes aging cause new weakness explain the
immunologic abnormalities reported patients. alternative explanation
is persistent recurrent poliovirus infection.
methods: assessed intrathecal antibody response poliovirus and
intrathecal production interleukin-2 soluble interleukin-2 receptors 36
patients post-polio syndrome 67 controls (including 13 had
poliomyelitis new symptoms 18 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
intrathecal antibody responses measles, mumps, herpes simplex, varicella
zoster viruses also determined.
results: oligoclonal igm bands specific poliovirus detected the
cerebrospinal fluid 21 36 patients post-polio syndrome (58
percent) none control group (p less 0.0001). quantitative
studies evidence increased intrathecal synthesis igm antibodies
to poliovirus among patients post-polio syndrome; 
increased synthesis igm measles, mumps, herpes simplex, varicella zoster
viruses. patients post-polio syndrome significantly higher mean (+/-
sd) (cerebrospinal fluid levels interleukin-2 soluble interleukin-2
receptors controls (8.1 +/- 5.3 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.8 u per milliliter and
159.6 +/- 102.9 vs. 10.7 +/- 6.2 u per milliliter, respectively). intrathecal
synthesis igm antibodies poliovirus correlated cerebrospinal fluid
concentrations interleukin-2 (p less 0.0005) soluble interleukin-2
receptors (p less 0.001).
conclusions: intrathecal immune response poliovirus present many
patients post-polio syndrome. patients the
recrudescence muscle weakness may caused persistent recurrent
infection neural cells poliovirus.
