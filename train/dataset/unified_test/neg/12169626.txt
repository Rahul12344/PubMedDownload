ctxphi filamentous bacteriophage whose genome encodes cholera toxin, the
principal virulence factor vibrio cholerae. found the
ctxphi-related element rs1 satellite phage whose transmission depends upon
proteins produced ctx prophage (its helper phage). however, unlike other
satellite phages satellite animal viruses, rs1 aid ctx prophage as
well exploit it, due rs1-encoded protein rstc. rstc, whose function
previously unknown, antirepressor counteracts activity 
phage repressor rstr. rstc promotes transcription genes required phage
production thereby promotes transmission rs1 ctxphi.
antirepression rstc also induces expression cholera toxin genes, ctxab,
and thus may contribute virulence v.cholerae. vitro, rstc binds
directly rstr, producing unusual, insoluble aggregates containing both
proteins. vivo, rstc rstr found cell pole, they
again appear form stable complexes. sequestration/inactivation process
induced rstc resembles induced mutant polyglutamine-containing
proteins implicated human neurodegenerative disorders.
