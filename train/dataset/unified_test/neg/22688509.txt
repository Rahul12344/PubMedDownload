purpose: aim study compare virologic response adefovir
(adv) add-on therapy switching entecavir (etv) monotherapy children
and adolescents chronic hepatitis b (chb) developed lamivudine
(lam) resistance lam treatment.
methods: twenty-seven consecutive patients chb developed lam
resistance lam treatment included. 27 patients, 8 patients
were treated addition adv ongoing lam 8 patients treated 
by switching etv monotherapy 16 patients compared 
the 11 patients treated switching adv alone, historical
control. therapeutic responses treatment evaluated 12, 24, 36, 48 
weeks initiation therapy measuring decrement hepatitis b
virus (hbv)-dna titers.
results: therapeutic period hbv-dna titer decrement (>2  log(10) iu/ml)
was significantly shorter lam+adv group etv group the
adv group (p = 0.008); however, significant difference the
lam+adv group etv group. rate virologic response, defined as
decrement hbv-dna titer undetectable levels 24 weeks, significantly 
higher lam+adv group etv group adv group
(p = 0.029).
conclusions: lam+adv combination therapy etv monotherapy exhibited
significantly effective virologic responses compared adv monotherapy 
in children adolescents lam-resistant chb, although no
significant difference lam+adv group etv group.
