epstein-barr virus (ebv) considered ubiquitous herpesvirus ability 
to cause latent infection humans worldwide. ebv-association evidently
linked different types human malignancies, mainly epithelial and
lymphoid origin. interest ebv nuclear antigen 3c (ebna3c) is
critical ebv-mediated immortalization. recently, ebna3c shown bind the
e2f1 transcription regulator. e2f transcription factors crucial roles in
various cellular functions, including cell cycle, dna replication, dna repair,
cell mitosis, cell fate. specifically, e2f6, one unique e2f family
members, known prb-independent transcription repressor e2f-target
genes. current study, explore role ebna3c regulating e2f6
activities. observed ebna3c plays important role inducing e2f6
expression lcls. study also shows ebna3c physically interacts with
e2f6 amino carboxy terminal domains form protein complex in
human cells. addition, ebna3c stabilizes e2f6 protein co-localized 
in nucleus. also demonstrated ebna3c e2f6 contribute to
reduction e2f1 transcriptional activity. moreover, e2f1 forms protein
complex ebna3c e2f6, ebna3c competes e2f1 e2f6 binding.
e2f6 also recruited ebna3c e2f1 promoter, critical for
ebna3c-mediated cell proliferation. results demonstrate critical role for
e2f family members ebv-induced malignancies, provide new insights for
targeting e2f transcription factors ebv-associated cancers potential
therapeutic intervention strategies.
