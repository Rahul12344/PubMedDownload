three cyclotides isolated whole plant viola yedoensis this
study. two, vary peptide e cycloviolacin y5, previously reported,
and novel cycloviolacin vy1 characterized according interpretation
of ms/ms fragmentation peptides produced reduced and
alkylated parent peptide digestion endo lys-c, trypsin and
chymotrypsin, separately. stability remarkable resistance proteolytic
degradation trypsin chymotrypsin, thermal denaturation was
confirmed again. besides, ic50 value cycloviolacin vy1 influenza a
h1n1 virus (2.27 +/- 0.20) microg x ml(-1). first cyclotide
reported anti-influenza h1n1 virus activity vitro assay.
