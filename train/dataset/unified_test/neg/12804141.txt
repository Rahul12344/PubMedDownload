replication-competent murine leukemia virus (mlv) vectors engineered to
achieve high efficiency gene transfer solid tumors vivo and
tumor-restricted replication, however safety enhanced by
redirecting tropism virus envelope. therefore tested targeting
capability replicative stability ecotropic amphotropic
replication-competent retrovirus (rcr) vectors containing two tandem repeats from
the immunoglobulin g-binding domain staphylococcal protein inserted the
proline-rich "hinge" region envelope, enables modular use of
antibodies various specificities vector targeting. modified envelopes 
were efficiently expressed incorporated virions, capable of
capturing monoclonal anti-her2 antibodies, mediated efficient binding 
virus-antibody complex her2-positive target cells. infectivity was
markedly reduced pseudotyping targeted envelopes alone, coexpression of
wild-type envelope rescued efficient cellular entry. ecotropic and
amphotropic rcr vector/anti-her2 antibody complexes achieved significant
enhancement transduction murine target cells overexpressing her2, which
could competed preincubation excess free antibodies. interestingly,
her2-expressing human breast cancer cells show enhancement of
transduction despite efficient antibody-mediated cell surface binding, suggesting
that target cell-specific parameters markedly affect efficiency of
post-binding entry processes. serial replication targeted vectors resulted 
selection z domain deletion variants, reduction overall size the
vector genome enhanced stability. application antibody-mediated targeting 
to initial localization replication-competent virus vectors tumor sites
will thus require optimized target selection vector design.
