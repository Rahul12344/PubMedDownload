survival outcomes liver retransplantation (lrtx) graft loss hcv
patients (hcv-lrtx) generally considered inferior after
non-hcv-lrtx. january 1, 2005 june 30, 2011, center performed 663
ltx, including 116 (17.5%) lrtx, 41 (35.3%) 90 after
the ltx. twenty-nine (70.7%) lrtx performed hcv antibody-positive
individuals. compared patient demographics, baseline characteristics and
outcomes hcv-lrtx group hcv-lrtx patients recent
optn database covering time period. kaplan-meier hcv-lrtx one-,
three-, five-yr hcv-lrtx patient survival rates 86.2%, 79.0%, 72.4%,
respectively compared optn one-, three-, five-yr hcv-lrtx survival
rates 73.3%, 59.0%, 51.3% respectively. likewise, graft survival rates
were higher optn rates time points studied. performed higher
percentage hcv-lrtx simultaneous liver/kidney transplants (slk) (37.9% vs. 
21.8%) recorded shorter warm (30 ± 4 vs. 45 ± 23 min) cold ischemic times
(5:44 ± 1:53 vs. 7:36 ± 3:12 h:min).conclusion: experience, hcv-lrtx
patient graft survival rates comparable ltx survival rates are
higher rates described optn.
