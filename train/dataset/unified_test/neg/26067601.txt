to establish productive infection, hiv-1 must counteract cellular innate immune
mechanisms redirect cellular processes toward viral replication. recent
studies discovered hiv-1 primate immunodeficiency viruses
subvert cell cycle regulatory mechanisms achieve ends. viral vpr and
vpx proteins target cell cycle controls counter innate immunity. the
cell-cycle-related protein cyclin l2 also utilized counter innate immunity.
the viral tat protein utilizes cyclin t1 activate proviral transcription, 
regulation cyclin t1 levels cd4(+) cells important consequences for
viral replication latency. review summarize emerging evidence 
that primate immunodeficiency viruses subvert cell cycle regulatory mechanisms to
enhance replication.
