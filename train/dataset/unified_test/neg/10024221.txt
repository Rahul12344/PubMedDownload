background: virus infections frequently exacerbate asthma, cases may 
even precipitate onset. although association well known, experimental
investigation hampered lack adequate models.
objective: effects acute respiratory virus infection sensitization to
aereoallergen investigated study.
methods: nebulized ovalbumin used aeroantigen normal mice, in
those infected respiratory syncytial virus influenza a.
results: viruses caused transient illness. ovalbumin inhalation not
induce specific serum antibodies unless mice infected time of
nebulization. exposed uninfected mice cutaneous challenge ovalbumin
caused response, caused acute systemic illness collapse previous
pulmonary exposure occurred respiratory infection. mice collapsed
in response cutaneous ovalbumin found igg1 specific ovalbumin 
that found mice. intracellular cytokine staining of
splenocyte cultures showed ovalbumin-specific production il-4 enhanced 
virus infection exposure. cd8+ cells, ovalbumin-specific
interferon-gamma production also enhanced co-infection influenza.
both viruses equally associated induction anaphylaxis.
conclusion: results show infection respiratory viruses powerfully
augments cellular humoral immune responses aeroantigen provide an
experimental model allows effects investigated.
