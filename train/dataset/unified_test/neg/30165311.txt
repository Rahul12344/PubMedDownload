extracellular vesicles (evs) released virus-infected cells typically
incorporate host viral components inside vesicles (cargo molecules).
here, investigated human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) proteins incorporated
in ev outer membrane released hcmv-infected cells. separated evs hcmv 
using iodixanol step-gradient found separated vesicles carried ev
markers tetraspanin cd63 rab27a. flow analysis individual evs 
demonstrated average, 15 ± 3.7% evs positive gb, 5.3 ± 2.3%
were positive gh 3.74 ± 1.5% positive gb gh. light
of previous findings demonstrating hiv envelope proteins ev membranes, the
presence viral protein surface evs released hcmv-infected cells
indicated viral membrane proteins incorporated evs released by
virus-infected cells may general phenomenon.
