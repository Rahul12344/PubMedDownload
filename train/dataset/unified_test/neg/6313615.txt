fourteen mitomycin-resistant revertants recb21 recc22 strain isolated
after tn5 mutagenesis. eight mutations (type i) essentially
inseparable apha+ (kanr) tn5; six (type ii) not. hypothesize that
the former tn5 latter is50 insertions. their
phenotypic similarity sbca sbcb mutations, also suppress recb21
recc22, called sbc mutations. sbc-lll::tn5 cotransducible with
nirr thereby located position 29.8 escherichia coli map in
the vicinity rac prophage sbca mutations. recb21 recc22 sbc-lll::tn5
strain subjected tn10 mutagenesis, mitomycin- uv-sensitive
mutant isolated. tet+ tn10 85% cotransducible apha+ tn5,
locating two transposons 0.1 map unit apart. three-point cross located
the tn10 mutation position 29.7. hypothesize tn10 insertion is
located rece tn5 is50 insertions activate expression 
gene. sbc-lll::tn5 found cis acting dominant wild-type
allele two sbca mutations (sbca1 sbca6). five type type
ii insertion mutations dominant wild-type alleles. hypothesize
that sbc insertion sbca mutations affect transcription regulation rece
and discuss possibility differently.
