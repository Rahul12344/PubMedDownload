objective: determine whether infection human enterovirus adenovirus,
both common intestinal viruses, predicts development coeliac disease.
design: case-control study nested within norwegian birth cohort recruited between
2001 2007 followed september 2016.
setting: norwegian population.
participants: children carrying hla genotype dr4-dq8/dr3-dq2 conferring
increased risk coeliac disease.
exposures: enterovirus adenovirus detected using real time polymerase chain
reaction monthly stool samples age 3 36 months.
main outcome measure: coeliac disease diagnosed according standard criteria.
coeliac disease antibodies tested blood samples taken age 3, 6, 9, and
12 months annually. adjusted odds ratios mixed effects logistic
regression model used assess relation viral infections before
development coeliac disease antibodies coeliac disease.
results: among 220 children, mean 9.9 (sd 1.6) years, 25 children 
were diagnosed coeliac disease screening matched two 
controls each. enterovirus found 370 (17%) 2135 samples was
significantly frequent samples collected development coeliac
disease antibodies cases controls (adjusted odds ratio 1.49, 95%
confidence interval 1.07 2.06; p=0.02). association restricted to
infections introduction gluten. high quantity samples (>100 000
copies/μl) (adjusted odds ratio 2.11, 1.24 3.60; p=0.01) long lasting
infections (>2 months) (2.16, 1.16 4.04; p=0.02) gave higher risk estimates.
both commonly detected enterovirus species enterovirus enterovirus b
were significantly associated coeliac disease. association found
for infections development coeliac disease antibodies.
adenovirus associated coeliac disease.
conclusions: longitudinal study, higher frequency enterovirus, but
not adenovirus, early childhood associated later coeliac disease.
the finding adds new information role viral infections aetiology
of coeliac disease.
