we compared trafficking glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored
placental alkaline phosphatase (plap) two chimeric transmembrane proteins
containing plap ectodomain stably transfected madin-darby canine kidney
epithelial cells determine whether different mechanisms might used in
apical sorting gpi-anchored transmembrane proteins. plap-g, which
contained transmembrane cytoplasmic domains vesicular stomatitis
virus glycoprotein, delivered directly basolateral surface. plap-ha
contained transmembrane cytoplasmic domains influenza hemagglutinin.
both plap plap-ha delivered directly apical membrane. plap
becomes insoluble triton x-100 biosynthetic transport, associates
with detergent-resistant membranes. neither hybrid protein detergent
insoluble, though small amount plap missorted basolateral 
surface insoluble. examined effects three drugs known interfere 
with membrane trafficking sorting delivery plap hybrid
proteins. monensin effect sorting surface expression the
proteins. nocodazole affected sorting plap plap-ha of
plap-g. brefeldin appeared disrupt sorting plap plap-ha not
of plap-g. conclusion tempered observation drug
affected distribution proteins cell surface. thus, sorting and
transport gpi-anchored apical transmembrane proteins similar a
number respects.
