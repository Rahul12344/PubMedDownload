human papillomaviruses possess circular double stranded dna genomes around 8kb
in size multiple mrnas synthesized infectious life
cycle. although least three viral promoters used initiate
transcription, viral mrnas largely product processing pre-mrnas 
alternative splicing polyadenylation. hpv life cycle viral gene
expression tightly linked differentiation epithelium virus
infects: orchestrated production viral mrnas proteins. this
review describe viral mrna expression roles sr hnrnp
proteins respectively positively negatively regulate splicing. we
discuss hpv regulation splicing factors detail evidence the
papillomavirus e2 protein splicing-related activities. highlight the
possibility hpv-mediated control splicing differentiating epithelial
cells may necessary accomplish viral replication cycle.
