the hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein 3 (ns3) cofactor ns4a 
is pivotal enzyme replication hcv. inhibition ns3-4a protease
activity validated antiviral target clinical studies of
inhibitors enzyme. developed sensitive time-resolved
fluorescence (trf) assay capable detecting low ns3-4a concentrations. a
depsipeptide substrate used contains europium-cryptate moiety an
efficient quenching group, qsy-7. trf assay least 30-fold more
sensitive fluorescence energy transfer (fret) assay allows evaluation 
of ns3 protease inhibitors reactions catalyzed low enzyme concentrations
(30 pm). use low enzyme concentrations allows accurate measurement of
inhibition compounds subnanomolar inhibition constants. inhibitory
potency potent protease inhibitor, biln-2061, significantly greater
than previously reported. ability accurately determine inhibitory potency 
in reactions low picomolar concentrations ns3-4a crucially important
to allow valid comparisons potent inhibitors. studies interaction 
of ns3 ns4a cofactor low enzyme concentration also reveal the
protease activity salt dependent. salt dependence enzyme activity 
is present high enzyme concentrations used fret assay.
