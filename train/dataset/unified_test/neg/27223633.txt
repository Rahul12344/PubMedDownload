dengue virus type 1 (denv-1) first serotype introduced brazil, 
in 1980s. since then, virus spread brazilian territory,
causing several outbreaks. 2013 highest number dengue cases was
notified, compared previous years brazil, state goiás
reported 160 thousand cases. study, aimed present the
phylodynamics denv-1 isolates state goiás, brazil, 2013
outbreak, based envelope gene (e) sequences. phylogenetic analysis
revealed brazilian denv-1 isolates grouped together viruses from
genotype v two distinct lineages (lineage lineage ii) reflecting
co-circulation. phylogeographic analyses showed lineages were
introduced different moments goiás, brazil, using distinct routes, likely
originated caribbean. lineage first introduced coming rio de 
janeiro (2007-2012), followed introduction argentina (2010-2013).
lineage ii introduced single moment rio de janeiro clade
has existed since 2007-2010. different viral introduction events demonstrate 
the viral dispersion process neighboring regions, essential the
maintenance outbreaks introduction new emerging viruses. conclusion,
obtained data reveals importance continuous molecular surveillance this
virus different regions, providing better understanding denv-1
circulation, considering evolutionary virus spread patterns.
