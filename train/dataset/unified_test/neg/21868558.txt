aim: effect gstm1 gstt1 allelic polymorphisms studied the
hpv-induced cervical carcinogenesis.
patients methods: two hundred fifty-three women persistent high-risk
hpv infection involved study; 117 developed cervical
high-grade dysplasia and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade iii during
the 7-year follow-up period. occurrence gstm1 gstt1 null genotypes was
compared women without dysplasia.
results: presence gstm1 (or=1.78, 95% ci=1.06-2.97; p=0.028) gstt1
(or=1.89, 95% ci=1.10-3.26; p=0.022) null genotypes statistically
significantly frequent among women cervical dysplasia group
without dysplasia. participants dual null genotype even elevated
risk precancerous lesion (or=2.35, 95% ci=1.17-4.73; p=0.017).
conclusion: study demonstrated role gstm1 t1 null genotypes
in development high-grade cervical dysplasia caucasian population.
