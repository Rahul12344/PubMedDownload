context.—: infectious gastroenteritis caused various pathogens, including
bacteria, viruses, parasites.
objective.—: compare performance seegene allplex gastrointestinal (24
targets: 13 bacteria, 5 viruses, 6 parasites 4 panels), luminex xtag
gastrointestinal pathogen panel (15 targets: 9 bacteria, 3 viruses, 3
parasites), bd max enteric panel (5 bacteria 3 parasites). estimated
the agreement among 3 molecular assays.
design.—: total 858 stool samples (554 bacterial/parasite 304 viral
pathogens) included. consensus positive/negative defined concordant
results least 2 tests. evaluate agreement among assays, κ
value calculated.
results.—: overall positive percentage agreements seegene, luminex, bd
max 94% (258 275), 92% (254 275), 78% (46 59), respectfully.
for salmonella, luminex showed low negative percentage agreement of
frequent false positives (n = 31) showing low median fluorescent intensity. for
viruses, positive/negative percentage agreements seegene luminex were
99%/96% 93%/99%, respectively. compared routine microbiology testing,
seegene, luminex, bd max additionally identified 39, 40, 12 pathogens,
respectively. sixty-one cases (16 cases seegene, 51 cases luminex, 
1 case bd max) showed positive results multiple pathogens, 3
were consensus positive.
conclusions.—: multiplex molecular assays appear promising tools 
the detection identification multiple gastrointestinal pathogens
simultaneously. however, careful interpretation positive results multiple 
pathogens required.
