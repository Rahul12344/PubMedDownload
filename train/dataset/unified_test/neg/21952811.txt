langerhans cells (lcs) distinct subset dcs resides epidermis
and epithelia. potent antigen-presenting cells strong inducers
of t-cell responses. like dc types, lcs express c-type lectins serve
as antigen/pathogen uptake receptors, langerin/cd207 the
characteristic lc c-type lectin. issue european journal of
immunology, geijtenbeek colleagues [eur. j. immunol. 2011. 41: 2619-2631]
assign role langerin human lcs binding capturing measles virus.
interestingly, however, function correlate productive
infection cross-presentation measles virus. authors show that
measles virus infect lcs via langerin, lcs cannot
cross-present virus cd8(+) cells; however, presentation virus to
cd4(+) cells occurs dependent virus capture langerin. thus,
cross-presentation measles virus may left skin dcs lcs. 
highlights complexity anti-viral t-cell responses originate the
skin also emphasizes need intensified investigations human skin 
dcs order able ultimately harness potential immunotherapy.
