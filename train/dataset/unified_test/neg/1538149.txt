polymerase chain reaction (pcr) newer serologic assays hepatitis c virus 
(hcv) used investigate 19 hcv cross-challenge episodes chimpanzees. in
these cross-challenges, 59% showed seroconversion challenge, 33% showed
reappearance hcv-associated hepatocellular ultrastructural changes, 5 animals 
not pcr-positive time challenge showed return pcr positivity, and
26% developed hepatitis rechallenge. total 74% showed least one 
these signs reinfection. frequency development serologic and
ultrastructural responses was, however, reduced secondary compared with
primary infections (p less .01). 10 animals, cross-challenge done
with heterologous strains, 9 originally infecting virus. there
was significant difference responses homologous heterologous
challenges. data suggest relatively weak immunity hcv infections.
