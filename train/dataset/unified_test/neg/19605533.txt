the rna genome hepatitis c virus (hcv) contains multiple conserved
structural cis domains direct protein synthesis, replication, and
infectivity. untranslatable regions (utrs) play essential roles hcv
cycle. uncapped viral rnas translated via internal ribosome entry site
(ires) located 5' utr, acts scaffold recruiting multiple
protein factors. replication viral genome initiated 3' utr.
bioinformatics methods identified structural rna elements thought to
be involved hcv cycle. 5bsl3.2 motif, embedded cruciform
structure 3' end ns5b coding sequence, contributes the
three-dimensional folding entire 3' end genome. essential

strand-specific, long-range rna-rna interaction 5' 3' ends the
genome, involves 5bsl3.2 ires motifs. mutants harboring substitutions
in apical loop domain iiid internal loop 5bsl3.2 disrupt

interaction. complex formed utrs related foot mouth
disease virus used binding assays, suggesting interaction is
specific hcv sequences. present data firmly suggest existence a
higher-order structure may mediate protein-independent circularization
