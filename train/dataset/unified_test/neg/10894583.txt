objective: measles virus implicated possible etiological agent 
in development inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). measles infection an
early age associated subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, degenerative 
neurological condition caused persistent measles infection central
nervous system. sought determine whether infection measles virus an
early age also associated increased risk developing ibd.
methods: patients measles infection diagnosed age 5 yr were
identified diagnostic indices mayo clinic rochester
epidemiology project. questionnaire used ascertain subsequent history 
of ibd, confirmed records subjects' physicians. risks
of developing crohn's disease ulcerative colitis calculated relative 
expected rates conditions olmsted county, minnesota population.
results: 1164 eligible cases, 662 (57%) completed questionnaire. there
were six confirmed cases crohn's disease six ulcerative colitis. the
expected number cases 1.9 crohn's disease (standardized incidence
ratio [sir] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.1-6.8) 2.0 ulcerative
colitis (sir 3.0, ci 1.1-6.5). trend towards higher risk of
developing ibd earlier age infection.
conclusions: early measles infection associated increased risk of
developing crohn's disease ulcerative colitis. risk may higher with
earlier infection.
