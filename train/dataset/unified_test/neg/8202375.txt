extremely high frequencies nucleotide found rna genomes of
the lentivirus group retroviruses. presently unknown molecular
force responsible a-pressure. manuscript, demonstrate a
correlation 'a-pressure' amino acid-usage lentivirus 
family. compared amino acid composition gag pol proteins the
human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 2 (hiv-1 hiv-2) the
second group human retroviruses; human t-cell leukemia viruses type 
ii (htlv-i htlv-ii). differences total amino acid content correlate with
the preference a-rich codons hiv genome. pair-wise comparison of
homologous amino acid positions pol proteins indicates both

the putative molecular mechanism underlying a-pressure evolutionary 
consequences discussed.
