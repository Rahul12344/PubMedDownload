background: 'global strategy dengue prevention control,
2012-2020' addresses growing need treatment dengue, targets 
25% reduction morbidity 50% mortality (using 2010 estimates as
baseline). achieving goals requires future dengue prevention strategies
that employ potential vaccines sustainable vector-control measures.
maternally transferred dengue antibody important factor determining 
optimal age dengue vaccination.
objectives: estimate seroprevalence dengue antibodies among mothers
living area high endemicity--ban pong, ratchaburi province--and to
assess maternal dengue antibodies transferred cord blood.
materials & methods: cross-sectional study conducted 141 pregnant
women delivered ban pong hospital, ratchaburi, thailand. maternal-cord
paired sera tested dengue neutralizing (nt) antibody prnt50 assay. 
ratio â‰¥ 1:10 nt titer dengue serotype considered seropositive.
results: mothers (137/141, 97.2%) nt antibodies least one dengue
serotype sera. birth, proportion cord sera nt antibodies 
to den-1, den-2, den-3, den-4, high similar sera their
mothers, 93.6%, 97.2%, 97.9%, 92.2%, respectively. dengue geometric
mean titers (gmt) cord blood significantly higher maternal
antibodies (p<0.001): highest den-2, followed den-3, den-1. the
gmt den-4 lowest among four serotypes.
conclusions: dengue infection highly prevalent among pregnant women this
dengue-endemic area. cord blood transferred dengue antibodies,
which may impact disease burden population.
