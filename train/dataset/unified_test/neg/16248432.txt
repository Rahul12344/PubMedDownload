in recent studies, found lmp1 encoded epstein-barr virus could
accelerate formation active c-jun/jun b heterodimer. studied the
regulation cyclind1 c-jun/jun b heterodimers laser scanning confocal
influorescence microscopy, western blot, luciferase activity assay, super-emsa
and flow cytometry tet-on-lmp1 hne2 cell line, lmp1 expression
was regulated tet-on system. c-jun/jun b heterodimers induced lmp1 could up
regulate cyclin d1 promoter activity expression. overexpression cyclin d1 
accelerated progression cell cycle.
