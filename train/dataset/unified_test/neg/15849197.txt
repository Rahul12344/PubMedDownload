keratan sulfate thought influence cleavage aggrecan by
metalloenzymes. therefore produced recombinant substrate, substituted
with keratan sulfate, suitable study aggrecanolysis vitro.
recombinant human g1-g2 produced primary bovine keratocytes using a
vaccinia virus expression system. following purification digestion with
specific hydrolases, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis used
to confirm presence monosulfated gal-glcnac6s glcnac6s-gal
disaccharides disulfated gal6s-glcnac6s disaccharides keratan sulfate.
negligible amounts fucose sialic acid detected, level of
unsulfated disaccharides minimal. treatment keratanases reduced size
of recombinant g1-g2 approximately 5 kda sds-page. treatment with
n-glycosidase f also reduced size g1-g2 approximately 5 kda and
substantially reduced g1-g2 immunoreactivity monoclonal antibody 5-d-4,
indicating keratan sulfate recombinant protein n-linked. cleavage 
of g1-g2 aggrecanase markedly reduced keratan sulfate chains were
removed treatment keratanase, keratanase ii, endo-beta-galactosidase, 
n-glycosidase f. results indicate modification oligosaccharides 
the aggrecan interglobular domain keratan sulfate, likely asparagine
residue 368, potentiates aggrecanase activity part core protein.
