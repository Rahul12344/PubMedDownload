purpose: success ebola virus (ebov) human pathogen relates the
molecular level primarily blockade host cell type interferon (ifn)
antiviral response. individuals survive ebola virus disease (evd)
develop chronic disease syndrome: approximately one-quarter survivors suffer
from uveitis, associated presence ebov within eye.
clinical observations post-ebola uveitis indicate involvement retinal
pigment epithelial cells.
methods: inoculated arpe-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells ebov, 
and followed course infection immunocytochemistry measurement titer 
in culture supernatant. interrogate transcriptional responses infected
cells, combined rna sequencing silico pathway, gene ontology,
transcription factor binding site, network analyses. measured
infection-induced changes selected transcripts reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
results: human retinal pigment epithelial cells permissive infection with
ebov, supported viral replication release virus high titer.
unexpectedly, 28% 560 upregulated transcripts ebov-infected cells type
i ifn responsive, indicating robust type ifn response. following ebov
infection, cells continued express multiple immunomodulatory molecules linked 
to ocular immune privilege.
conclusions: human retinal pigment epithelial cells may serve intraocular
reservoir ebov, molecular response infected cells may contribute
to persistence live ebov within human eye.
translational relevance: bedside-to-bench research links ophthalmic findings
in survivors evd suffer uveitis interactions retinal
pigment epithelial cells ebov.
