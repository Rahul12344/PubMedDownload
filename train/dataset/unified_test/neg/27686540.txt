objective: retrospectively investigate clinical characteristics, risk
factors cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection patients underlying rheumatic 
diseases. methods: clinical records 263 rheumatic patients without cmv
infection, hospitalized march 2011 june 2014 peking university
people's hospital, analyzed.clinical characteristics summarized and
compared cmv positive negative groups, investigate risk factors for
cmv infection.statistical analyses conducted spss 20.0 software.
results: total 62 rheumatic patients found cmv infection, 
48 regarded cmv viremia, 7 diagnosed cmv pneumonia, remaining 7
suffered cmv viremia pneumonia.eleven 62 patients (17.7%) fatal
outcome.systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) commonly underlying
disease (41.9%), followed sj√∂gren syndrome (16.1%) systemic vasculitis
(12.9%). lymphopenia reduction cd4+ lymphocytes, corticosteroids,
cyclophosphamide (ctx) mycophenolate mofetil (mmf), combined use 
2 immunosuppressants severe underlying infections risk factors for
cmv infection rheumatic patients.meanwhile, total dose ctx wasn't
different significantly cmv positive negative groups.multivariate
analysis revealed large pulsed dose corticosteroids, combined use of
immunosuppressants, severe underlying infections remained independent risk
factors cmv infection. conclusions: lymphocytes, particularly cd4+ t
subsets, might play vital role regulation control cmv
infection.other underlying infections, undergoing large dose corticosteroids
therapy combined use immunosuppressants could risk factors cmv
infection rheumatic patients.
