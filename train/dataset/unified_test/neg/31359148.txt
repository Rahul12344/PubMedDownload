maize chlorotic mottle virus (mcmv), important quarantine virus, causes lethal
necrosis maize coinfected potyvirid, seriously
threatening production maize worldwide. study, recombinase
polymerase amplification (rpa), novel isothermal dna amplification and
detection technique, developed detect mcmv maize crops. pair of
specific primers designed based conserved sequences mcmv coat
protein region. rt-rpa assay carried isothermal reaction 38 
Â°c complete within 30 min, cross-reactivity detected with
other viruses infecting maize china. limit detection rt-rpa
assay tenfold lower ordinary rt-pcr. moreover, method was
successfully applied test field-collected samples. newly developed rt-rpa 
assay offers reliable, sensitive efficient method rapid detection of
mcmv maize equipment-limited diagnostic laboratories on-site
facilities.
