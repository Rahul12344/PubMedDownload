study polypeptide content erwiniophage zf40c(5/5) zf40-421 virulent
mutants shown virions include less 10 structural proteins 
with molecular weights ranging 16.9 96.5 kda. three polypeptides belong
to group major proteins molecular weights 39.2, 33.1 18.5 kda. they
correlate polypeptides phage head, tail sheath tail core
correspondingly. proven protein contents phages are
identical, taking account percent ratio polypeptides
approaches 1.0. polypeptide profile isogenic variant phage zf40-421
obtained eccrc5297 characterized another ratio major proteins. 
differences reflected structure procapsids, explains low level
of stability viability variant. work shows first time 
possibility using hplc-chromatography studying native phage particles 
their structural components.
