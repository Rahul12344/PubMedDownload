citrus sudden death (csd) new disease sweet orange mandarin trees
grafted rangpur lime citrus volkameriana rootstocks. first seen 
brazil 1999, since detected four million trees. 
csd causal agent unknown current hypothesis involves virus similar
to citrus tristeza virus new virus named citrus sudden death-associated
virus. csd symptoms include generalized foliar discoloration, defoliation and
root death, and, cases, cause tree death. one unique
characteristics csd disease presence yellow stain rootstock
bark near bud union. region also undergoes profound anatomical changes. 
in study, analyse metabolic disorder caused csd bark of
sweet orange grafted rangpur lime nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)
spectroscopy imaging. imaging results show presence large amount
of non-functional phloem rootstock bark affected plants. the
spectroscopic analysis shows high content triacylglyceride sucrose,
which may related phloem blockage close bud union. also propose
that, without knowing causal csd agent, determination oil content in
rootstock bark low-resolution nmr used complementary method for
csd diagnosis, screening 300 samples per hour.
