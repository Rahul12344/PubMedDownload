purpose: lower cd4+ t-cell counts related increased morbidity and
mortality despite virologic suppression. ccr5 antagonists associated with
robust cd4+ t-cell responses. examined relationship ccr5 antagonists to
cd4+ t-cell gains.
design: meta-regression recent phase 2-3 trials evaluating new antiretroviral 
agents treatment-experienced subjects.
methods: analyzed relationship ccr5 antagonists cd4+ t-cell count
increase 24 weeks initiating new regimen using linear model with
generalized estimating equations controlling differing rates virologic
suppression. treatment group treated data point weighted sample 
size.
results: included 46 treatment groups 17 trials (11 groups 5 trials 
used ccr5 antagonists). controlling average baseline hiv-1 rna proportion
of subjects achieving hiv-1 rna <50 copies/ml, use ccr5 antagonist was
associated additional significant cd4+ t-cell gain +30/Î¼l (95% ci,
19-42) 24 weeks compared treatment groups using ccr5 antagonist.
conclusions: use ccr5 antagonist associated enhanced cd4+ t-cell
count response independent virologic suppression. observation supports
further evaluation ccr5 antagonists patients discordant immunologic
and virologic responses art.
