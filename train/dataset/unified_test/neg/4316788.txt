immunofluorescence serums many patients infectious mononucleosis,
burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma. antibodies rarely

prevented synthesis early antigens, provided serums mixed the
virus prior inoculation. antibodies early antigens possibly reflect current
or recent disease processes associated virus.
