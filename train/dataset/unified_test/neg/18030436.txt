the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif-1alpha) major regulator of
energy homeostasis cellular adaptation low oxygen stress. recently,
hif-1alpha discovered function global regulator macrophage
and neutrophil inflammatory innate immune functions, befits these
specialized phagocytic cells must operate effectively hypoxic
microenvironments infected tissues. review summarizes current knowledge
of role hif-1alpha mammalian innate immunity, emphasizing insight
gained conditional gene targeting transcription factor myeloid
cell lineage. dynamic changes hif-1alpha expression course of
bacterial, viral, parasitic infections outlined inferences drawn
regarding consequences pathogen host. better understanding of
hif-1alpha function may provide novel rational approaches boosting innate
immune function therapy certain complicated infectious disease
conditions.
