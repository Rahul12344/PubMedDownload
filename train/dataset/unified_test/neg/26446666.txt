post-transcriptional modification viral mrna essential translation 
of viral proteins cellular translation machinery. due cytoplasmic
replication paramyxoviruses, viral-encoded rna-dependent rna polymerase
(rdrp) thought possess activities required mrna capping and
methylation. present work, using partially purified recombinant rna
polymerase complex rinderpest virus expressed insect cells, demonstrate 
the vitro methylation capped mrna. further, show recombinant
c-terminal fragment (1717-2183 aa) l protein capable methylating capped 
mrna, suggesting various post-transcriptional activities l
protein located independently folding domains.
