background: malignancies lymphoma common complications kidney
transplantation. however, link made incidence of
malignancies hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection setting. this
case-controlled study compared incidence malignancies, including lymphoma,
between kidney transplant (kt) patients without hcv replication.
patients methods: total 99 hcv-positive rna-positive kt patients were
matched 198 (1:2) anti-hcv-negative patients according age, gender, and
date transplantation, followed 145.8±78.4 months.
results: follow-up period, 28 hcv-positive (28%) cases developed at
least one cancer, 64 (32%) patients developed cancer hcv-negative
group (p=not significant [ns]). survival without cancer similar between
both groups. thirteen hcv-positive patients (13%) developed least one solid
cancer vs 29 (15%) hcv-negative patients (p=ns). survival without solid cancer 
was similar groups. three patients hcv-positive 4 
the hcv-negative group developed lymphoma. 2 patients hcv group
died hepatocellular carcinoma. survival without skin cancer similar
between groups. patient death-censored graft survival rates were
significantly lower hcv group.
conclusion: incidences types malignancies similar the
hcv-positive hcv-negative kt patients.
