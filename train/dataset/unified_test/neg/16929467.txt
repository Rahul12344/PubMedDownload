genome sequences several blood borne respiratory viruses recently
been recovered directly clinical specimens variants technique known 
as sequence-independent single primer amplification. related methods are
increasingly used search causes diseases presumed
infectious aetiology, agent yet found. methods
that require prior knowledge genome sequence virus may 
be present patient specimen include whole genome amplification, random pcr
and subtractive hybridisation differential display. review considers the
development application techniques.
