atp-dependent dna ligases, nad(+)-dependent dna ligases, gtp-dependent rna
capping enzymes members covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily
defined common fold set conserved peptide motifs. examined 
the role nucleotidyl transferase motif v ((184)llkmkqfkdaeat(196)) nick
joining reaction chlorella virus dna ligase, exemplary atp-dependent
enzyme. found alanine substitutions lys(186), lys(188), asp(192), 
glu(194) reduced ligase specific activity least order magnitude,
whereas substitutions lys(191) thr(196) benign. k186a, d192a, and
e194a changes effect rate single-turnover nick joining by
preformed ligase-adenylate affected subsequent rounds nick joining 
ligase adenylation step. conservative substitutions k186r, d192e, e194d
partially restored activity, whereas k186q, d192n, e194q substitutions did
not. alanine mutation lys(188) elicited distinctive catalytic defects, whereby
single-turnover nick joining k188a-adenylate slowed order of
magnitude, high levels dna-adenylate intermediate accumulated. the
rate phosphodiester bond formation pre-adenylated nick (step 3 the
ligation pathway) slowed k188a change. replacement lys(188) by
arginine reversed step 3 arrest, whereas glutamine substitution was
ineffective. gel-shift analysis showed lys(188) mutants bound stably 
dna-adenylate. infer lys(188) involved chemical step of
phosphodiester bond formation.
