contractile injection systems (ciss) cell-puncturing nanodevices share
ancestry contractile tail bacteriophages. photorhabdus virulence cassette
(pvc) represents one group extracellular ciss present both
bacteria archaea. here, report cryo-em structure intact pvc from
p. asymbiotica. 10-mda device resembles simplified t4 phage tail,
containing a hexagonal baseplate complex six fibers capped
117-nanometer sheath-tube trunk. one distinct feature pvc presence 
of three variants tube sheath proteins, indicating functional
specialization evolution. terminal hexameric cap docks onto
the topmost layer inner tube locks outer sheath pre-contraction
state six stretching arms. results pvc provide framework for
understanding general mechanism widespread ciss pave way using
them delivery tools biological therapeutic applications.
