background: inner outer (ino) gene, encodes yabby-type
transcription factor, specifies promotes growth outer integument
of ovule arabidopsis. ino expression limited abaxial cell layer 
of developing outer integument ovule regulated multiple
regions ino promoter, including pos9, positive element present
in quadruplicate produce low-level expression normal ino pattern.
results: significant redundancy activity different regions ino 
promoter demonstrated. specific regulatory elements, multimerization or
the addition cauliflower mosaic virus 35s general enhancer able to
activate expression reporter gene constructs otherwise incapable 
expression own. new promoter element, pos6, defined shown to
include sufficient positive regulatory information reproduce endogenous
pattern expression ovules, promoter regions necessary to
fully suppress expression outside ovules. full-length ino promoter, but
not ino promoter deletions tested, able act an
enhancer-blocking insulator prevent ectopic activation expression by
the 35s enhancer. sequence conservation promoter regions of
arabidopsis thaliana, brassica oleracea brassica rapa aligns closely the
functional definition pos6 pos9 regions, defined ino
minimal promoter. b. oleracea ino promoter sufficient promote similar
pattern level reporter gene expression arabidopsis observed for
the arabidopsis promoter.
conclusions: least two independent regions ino promoter contain
sufficient regulatory information direct specific pattern the
level ino gene expression. regulatory regions act partially
redundant manner promote expression specific pattern ovule and
suppress expression outside ovules. establishment pattern requires
cooperation competition multiple positive negative regulatory
elements.
