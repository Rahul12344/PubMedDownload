background: influenza viruses possess rna genomes mutate frequently in
response immune pressures. mutations hemagglutinin genes are
particularly significant, hemagglutinin proteins mediate attachment and
fusion host cells, thereby influencing viral pathogenicity species
specificity. large-scale influenza genome sequencing efforts ongoing 
to understand past epidemics pandemics anticipate future outbreaks.
sequencing efforts thus far generated nearly 9,000 distinct hemagglutinin
amino acid sequences.
description: comparative models publicly available influenza a
hemagglutinin protein sequences (8,769 date) generated using rosetta 
modeling suite. c-alpha root mean square deviations randomly chosen
test set models crystallographic templates less 2 Ã¥,
suggesting modeling protocols yielded high-quality results. models
were compiled online resource, hemagglutinin structure prediction
(hasp) server. hasp server designed scientific tool researchers 
to visualize hemagglutinin protein sequences interest three-dimensional
context. built-in molecular viewer, hemagglutinin models compared
side-by-side navigated corresponding sequence alignment. models 
alignments downloaded offline use analysis.
conclusions: modeling protocols used hasp server scale well large 
amounts sequences keep pace expanded sequencing efforts. the
conservative approach modeling intuitive search visualization
interfaces allow researchers quickly analyze hemagglutinin sequences of
interest context highly related experimental structures, and
allow directly compare hemagglutinin sequences other
simultaneously two- three-dimensional contexts. models and
methodology shown utility current research efforts ongoing aim of
the hasp server continue accelerate influenza research a
positive impact global public health.
