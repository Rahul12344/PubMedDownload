wild-type adenovirus coinfected mutant temperature sensitive the
immediate-early gene pseudorabies virus. nonpermissive temperature,
this mutant, tsg, strongly inhibited transcription adenovirus early
genes, including e1a. inhibition observed wild-type
pseudorabies virus coinfection tsg coinfection permissive
temperature. level repression dependent upon ratio tsg to
adenovirus infection. results suggest temperature-sensitive
protein may interacting transcription factors viral dna with
the dna inhibit adenovirus transcription.
