the etiology monoclonal gammopathies remains unclear familial occurrence
of immunopathies seems favor possible hereditary background. support of
this view report family five siblings monoclonal
gammopathy. mgus diagnosed two them, family study carried
out: one sister died multiple myeloma four seven living
siblings discovered mgus. immunogenetic study (hla) showed 
direct correlation haplotypes presence monoclonal protein.
nevertheless possible environmental exposure viruses, chemicals radiation 
was apparently excluded. new report familial involvement, second ever
reported number affected subjects, strongly supports theory genetic
predisposition development plasma cell dyscrasias.
