objective: explore correlation serum hepatitis b surface antigen
(hbsag) level hepatic tissue pathological staging patients chronic
hepatitis b (chb).
methods: clinical data collected hospital's records 302 chb
patients hbsag-positive status 6 months undergone 
hepatic biopsy. hbsag level,hbv dna level clinical data were
measured using commercial diagnostic assays. liver histology scored using the
gs staging system. correlation serum hbsag quantity, hbv dna quantity,
stage inflammation degree fibrosis assessed statistically.
results: correlation serum hbsag level hbv dna level notable. 
serum hbsag level variable affecting hepatic tissue pathological stage
significantly. serum hbsag level appeared highly specific sensitive
diagnostic marker hepatic fibrosis. severity liver fibrosis
increased, quantitative levels platelet (plt), hbsag hbv dna gradually
decreased, apri index gradually increased; significant
differences groups (all p<0.001). serum hbsag hbv dna levels in
patients hepatitis b e antigen-positive (hbeag(+)) status showed strong
correlation (r=0.721, p<0.0001) spearman analysis. hbeag(+) patients with
moderate severe fibrosis (s2-4) exhibited significantly lower serum hbsag 
hbv dna levels compared patients mild fibrosis (s0-1; t=5.475 and
4.826, p<0.001). roc analysis suggested serum hbsag cutoff 4.46 log 10 
iu/ml (28 800 iu/ml) would provide theoretical sensitivity 76.3%, with
theoretical specificity 70.5% hbeag(+) chb patients. serum hbv dna cutoff
of 7.13 log 10 iu/ml (1.35*10(7) copies/ml) would provide theoretical
sensitivity 71.1%, theoretical specificity 73.4% hbeag(+) chb
patients. logistic regression analysis showed level hbsag an
independent prognostic factor moderate severe liver fibrosis, alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, hbsag, hbv dna plt (p<0.001).
conclusion: hbsag hbv dna levels decrease gradually along aggravation of
liver fibrosis. cutoff values 28800 iu/ml hbsag 1.35*10(7)
copies/ml ofhbv dna provide higher specificity sensitivity predicting the
degree liver fibrosis hbeag-positive chb patients, former an
independent predictor severe liver fibrosis.
