restored rod visual function gene therapy established unequivocally 
by demonstrating that, dark adaptation, spectral sensitivity shape 
characteristic rods shape collapses cone-like shape 
rods recovered intense bleach. used tests assess
retinal function eight young adults children early-onset severe
retinal dystrophy phase ii clinical gene-therapy trial rpe65
deficiency involved subretinal delivery recombinant
adeno-associated viral vector carrying rpe65. found substantial improvements
in rod sensitivity two participants: dark-adapted spectral sensitivity was
rod-like treatment cone-like rods recovered a
bleach. 40 min dark adaptation, one participant showed 1,000-fold 
sensitivity improvements 4 months treatment second 100-fold
improvements 6 months treatment. dark-adapted spectral sensitivities of
the six participants remained cone-like showed little improvement in
sensitivity.
