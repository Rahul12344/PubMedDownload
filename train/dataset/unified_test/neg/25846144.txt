patients hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection cirrhosis are
underrepresented clinical trials interferon-free regimens direct-acting 
antiviral agents, making difficult optimize therapy. performed a
post-hoc analysis data seven clinical trials evaluate efficacy and
safety fixed-dose combination ledipasvir (ldv) sofosbuvir (sof),
with without ribavirin (rbv), 513 treatment-naïve previously treated
patients genotype 1 hcv compensated cirrhosis. patients received
ldv-sof 12 24 weeks without rbv. determined rates of
sustained virological response (svr) 12 weeks treatment (svr12) overall and
for subgroups. 513 patients analyzed, 69% previously treated 47% 
had failed previous treatment protease-inhibitor regimen. overall, 493
patients (96%; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 94%-98%) achieved svr12, 98% of
treatment-naïve 95% previously treated patients. svr12 rates vary 
greatly treatment duration (95% patients receiving 12 weeks 98% of
patients receiving 24 weeks treatment), addition rbv (95% of
patients receiving ldv-sof alone 97% received ldv-sof plus rbv),
although previously treated patients receiving 12 weeks ldv-sof without rbv
had svr12 rate 90%. one patient discontinued ldv-sof adverse 
event (ae). common aes headache (23%), fatigue (16%-19%), and
asthenia (14%-16%). one patient (<1%) receiving ldv-sof alone, 4
(2%) receiving ldv-sof plus rbv treatment-related serious
aes.conclusions: analysis suggests 12 weeks ldv-sof safe and
effective treatment-naïve patients hcv genotype 1 compensated
cirrhosis. relatively lower svr treatment-experienced patients treated
with 12 weeks ldv-sof raises question whether patients would
benefit adding rbv extending treatment duration 24 weeks.
