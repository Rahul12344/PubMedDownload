a novel hepatotropic virus, named nv-f virus, recently identified. the
clinical information virus still scarce. using pcr assay, nv-f viral 
dna (nv-f-dna) detected 12 50 (24%) hepatitis c virus (hcv)-infected
patients (hcv-coinfected [hcvci] group), 34 250 (13.6%) hepatitis b virus
(hbv)-infected patients (hbv-coinfected [hbvci] group), 28 100 (28%)
non-a-to-e (nae) hepatitis patients. basic clinical parameters not
significantly different among three groups. use pcr-based
quantitative assay, nv-f-dna concentration found the
detection limit (1.2 x 10(5) copies/ml) 12/12 (100%) hcvci patients, 14/34
(41.2%) hbvci patients, 4/28 (14.3%) nae patients. median serum nv-f-dna 
concentration 9.3 x 10(5) copies/ml hcvci patients, the
detection limit hbvci nae patients (p values 0.0045 0.0001,
respectively). stepwise multiple regression analysis identified presence of
anti-hcv independent factor nv-f-dna concentrations (beta = 6.2 x
10(9); p = 0.0245). hbvci patients, nv-f-dna concentration inversely
correlated hbv dna concentration. median nv-f-dna concentration 
below detection limit patients hbv dna concentrations 1.4 x
10(5) copies/ml, 1.58 x 10(6) copies/ml patients hbv dna
concentrations 1.4 x 10(5) copies/ml (p = 0.030). conclusion, nv-f-dna
concentrations higher hcvci patients. reciprocal relationship found
between nv-f-dna hbv dna concentrations hbvci patients, indicating the
presence viral interference two dna viruses.
