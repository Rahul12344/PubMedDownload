understanding colloidal interactions norovirus particles aqueous
medium could provide insights origins notorious stability and
infectivity widespread viral agents. characterized effects of
solution ph surfactant type concentration aggregation, dispersion,
and disassembly norovirus virus-like particles (vlps) using dynamic light
scattering, electrophoretic light scattering, transmission electron
microscopy. owing net negative surface charge vlps neutral ph, low
concentrations cationic surfactant tend aggregate vlps, whereas low
concentrations anionic surfactant tend disperse particles. increasing
the concentration surfactants beyond critical micelle
concentration leads virus capsid disassembly breakdown aggregates.
non-ionic surfactants, however, little effect virus interactions and
likely stabilized additionally suspension. data interpreted on
the basis simple models surfactant binding re-charging virus
capsid. used zeta potential data characterize virus surface charge and
interpret mechanisms behind demonstrated surfactant-virus interactions.
the fundamental understanding control interactions aid in
practical formulations virus inactivation removal contaminated
surfaces.
