bumblebees commercially reared transported worldwide mainly for
pollination greenhouse tomatoes. three honeybee viruses reported 
bumblebees: acute bee paralysis virus, kashmir bee virus deformed wing virus.
we developed multiplex rt-pcr primers designed highly conserved regions
of rna-dependent rna polymerase order detect maximum range viral
variants. rearing facilities governmental organizations thoroughly
screen bumblebee colonies cost-effective technique integrated
internal amplification control (iac) implementable laboratories strive
for international organization standardization (iso) certification.
