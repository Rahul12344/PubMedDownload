purification characterization gene 8 product bacteriophage t3.

nakasu s, fujisawa h, minagawa t.

the product gene 8 (gp8) t3 phage purified proheads, heads, and
extract prepared cells infected mutant defective gene 10 (major
head protein) (10- extract). gp8, purified hydrophobic column
chromatography proheads solubilized guanidine hydrochloride, show
any ordered structure. gp8 heads ruptured sucrose shock sedimented a
sedimentation coefficient 20 (20 assembly). electron micrography 20 s
assemblies showed ring structures displaying radial symmetry. gp8 20 
s assemblies concentrated, formed two-dimensional crystals. gp8 20 s
material detected 10- extract sedimentation analysis. gp8 purified from
10- extract anti-gp8 antibody column chromatography ordered structure
identical 20 assembly heads. effect anti-gp8 serum
on activity proheads heads examined vitro complementation.
anti-gp8 serum preabsorbed 5- x 8- -extracted inactivated proheads and
heads. anti-gp8 serum preabsorbed proheads inactivated heads not
proheads. similarly, anti-gp8 serum preabsorbed phage-inactivated proheads
but heads. results, concluded gp8 proheads heads
is accessible antibodies different antigenic sites gp8 exposed
in proheads heads.
