dendritic cells (dcs) develop bone marrow (bm) progenitor cells mature
in response external signals elicit functions important innate and
adaptive immunity. interferon consensus sequence binding protein (icsbp; also
called interferon regulatory factor 8 [irf-8]) hematopoietic cell-specific
transcription factor expressed bm progenitor cells contributes myeloid
cell development. light earlier observation icsbp(-/-) mice lack
cd8alpha(+) dcs, investigated role icsbp dc development vitro 
the presence flt3 ligand. immature icsbp(-/-) dcs developed bm progenitor
cells showed assorted defects, mature response activation signals, 
and failed express cd8alpha interleukin 12 (il-12) p40, feature
consistent icsbp(-/-) dcs vivo. show retroviral introduction of
icsbp restores development immature dcs fully mature on
activation signals. defects seen icsbp(-/-) dcs corrected after
icsbp transduction, including expression cd8alpha il-12 p40 well as
major histocompatability complex class ii costimulatory molecules.
icsbp known regulate gene expression interacting partner proteins
pu.1 irfs, thereby binding target elements isre eice. analysis a
series icsbp mutants showed intact dna-binding activity well as
the ability interact partner proteins required restoration of
dc development/maturation, pointing transcriptional function icsbp a
basis restoration. taken together, study identifies icsbp factor
critical early differentiation final maturation dcs.
