epstein-barr virus-induced gene 3 (ebi3) encodes secretory glycoprotein, and
has previously identified upregulated various types tumors. the
presnet study examined clinical significance ebi3 expression for
predicting tumor recurrence survival resection hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc). ebi3 expression various hcc cell lines 20 pairs of
tumor peritumor tissue samples detected using western blot analysis.
immunohistochemical staining using tissue microarray 312 samples from
randomly selected patients hcc underwent surgery. survival analysis 
performed using univariate multivariate analyses. ebi3 protein level was
higher l-02 cells peri-tumor tissues compared tumor tissues.
immunohistochemical staining ebi3 reduced hcc tissues comparison
with adjacent normal tissues significantly associated tumor invasive
characteristics, including tumor thrombus, poor differentiation large size.
notably, results suggested ebi3 predictor tumor recurrence and
patient survival, multivariate analysis indicated ebi3 independent
prognostic factor. even early-stage disease, low ebi3 expression also
independently associated increased tumor recurrence shortened survival. 
downregulation ebi3 hcc indicated aggressive tumor behaviors predicted 
a severe clinical outcome, suggests ebi2 may useful
biomarker identify patients high risk post-operative recurrence.
