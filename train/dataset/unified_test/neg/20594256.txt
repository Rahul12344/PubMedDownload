background aim: despite 60-90% injection drug users (idus) are
infected hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, idus often denied therapy
based concerns reinfection following treatment. however, little
data regard. evaluated hcv re-infection following sustained virologic 
response (svr) among hcv-infected idus received hcv treatment a
multidisciplinary program.
methods: following treatment, participants encouraged return follow-up
intervals 1 year illicit drug use histories obtained. with
svr, hcv rna testing pcr performed determine relapse reinfection 
occurred.
results: among 58 receiving hcv treatment january 2002 december 2006,
60% (35 58) achieved svr. patients followed median 2.0 years 
following svr (range, 0.4-5.0 years), ongoing illicit injection drug use
reported 54% (19 35) 46% (16 35). 35 svr, 28 remained
hcv rna negative follow-up (80%), four lost follow-up one
dying hepatocellular carcinoma two cases reinfection observed (2
of 35). rates reinfection 3.2 per 100 p-y (95% ci:0.4, 11.5) overall 
and 5.3 per 100 p-y (95% ci:0.6, 19.0) among reporting injecting following 
svr (n = 16). one two participants hcv re-infection spontaneously cleared
virus following reinfection.
conclusion: rate reinfection following treatment hcv infection among
current former idus engaged multidisciplinary program low.
