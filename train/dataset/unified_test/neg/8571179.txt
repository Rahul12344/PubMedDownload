background: course aids, 25 44% homosexual patients infected 
with human immunodeficiency virus develop kaposi's sarcoma. main
manifestation skin. response rates 80 100% achieved with
total dosage 50 gy. nevertheless, remissions also attained 20
gy fractionated radiotherapy. clinical data low dose conventional
fractionated radiotherapy insufficient analysed response rates an
overall dose 20 gy conventional fractionation.
patients methods: june 1991 june 1993, 43 patients 111
hiv-associated kaposi's sarcoma skin oral cavity treated. lesions 
were irradiated 5 12 mev electrons 60co gamma-rays. fractionation 
scheme 5 times 2 gy/week skin endoral lesions total reference 
dosage 20 gy. side effects assessed therapy the
therapeutic result 6 weeks end treatment.
results: thirty-eight 111 lesions judged complete response (cr)
(34%), 61/111 partial response (pr) (55%) 12/111 judged change 
(nc) (11%). overall response (cr + pr) 89%. two patients lesions oral
cavity suffered rtog grade-iv mucositis 10 14 gy. 71/106 skin
lesions (67%), radiation induced rtog grade-1 reactions observed.
conclusion: patients hiv associated kaposi's sarcoma effective palliation
can achieved means radiotherapy overall dose 20 gy in
conventional fractionation. yet, fraction patients complete responses
is 34 47% lower compared doses 20 gy (66 100%). with
reference reported data results point dose-response relationship 
for kaposi's sarcoma. therefore higher total reference doses, e.g. 30 gy with
weekly 5 times 2 gy 24 gy 5 times 1.6 gy mucous lesions,
respectively, suggested mean complete response rate be
doubled.
