background: conducted investigations 2 villages cambodia outbreaks
of influenza h5n1 occurred among humans poultry determine frequency of
and risk factors h5n1 virus transmission.
methods: may 2006, approximately 7 weeks outbreaks influenza h5n1
among poultry occurred, villagers living near households 2 patients with
influenza h5n1 interviewed potential h5n1 exposures blood
samples obtained h5n1 serological testing microneutralization assay. a
seropositive result defined influenza h5n1 neutralizing antibody titer 
of 1:80, confirmation western blot assay. case-control study was
conducted identify risk factors influenza h5n1 virus infection. control
subjects, seronegative results tests, matched with
h5n1-seropositive persons village residence, households influenza
h5n1-infected poultry flock, sex, age.
results: seven (1.0%) 674 villagers tested seropositive influenza h5n1
antibodies report severe illness; 6 (85.7%) male. 7
h5n1-seropositive persons, aged<or=18 years, younger than
participants tested seronegative h5n1 antibodies (median age, 12.0 years 
vs. 27.4 years; p=.03) likely 24 control subjects 
report bathing swimming household ponds (71.4% vs. 20.8%; matched odds
ratio, 11.3; p=.03).
conclusions: avian-to-human transmission influenza h5n1 virus remains low,
despite extensive poultry contact. exposure potentially contaminated
environment risk factor human infection.
