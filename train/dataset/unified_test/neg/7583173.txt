the development techniques manipulating nucleic acids strategies for
delivering dna humans made gene therapy reality. although mostly focused
on genetically based diseases far, every reason expand concept
to include acquired diseases. critical illness may good target gene
therapy high mortality need transient treatment.
genes delivered vivo using viral vectors (replication-deficient
adenovirus adeno-associated virus often). viral vectors some
negatives, mainly triggering inflammatory immune response.
nonviral dna delivery systems include liposomes (cationic anionic), direct dna
injection, polycation-dna-glycoconjugates. combining liposomes viral
components deliver plasmids transgene may improve efficiency of
delivery without causing toxicity. model acute lung injury, vivo
delivery vector hyperexpressing prostaglandin synthase gene using
cationic liposomes resulted increased production prostaglandin e2 and
prostacyclin lungs, protected lungs effects endotoxin.
this end-result demonstrates feasibility approach. similar
rationale treatment sepsis could used. promising therapeutic 
genes would include encoding antioxidant enzymes antiproteases. the
logistics moving initial studies gene therapy critically ill humans 
have worked diseases; steps expedite the
exploration new category therapies.
