the significant burden hiv/hepatitis c virus (hcv) coinfection increasingly
recognized worldwide, particular within asia-pacific region.
individuals coinfected viruses risk accelerated
liver disease consequently cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular
carcinoma. addition, coinfected individuals may altered immunological
responses haart increased risk highly active antiretroviral
therapy (haart)-related hepatotoxicity. treatment hcv infection in
hiv-infected individuals standard pegylated interferon ribavirin
therapy, hiv/hcv coinfected subjects undergo suitability hcv
treatment assessment. response rates hcv therapy generally 10-15% lower
than hcv monoinfection, therapy may complicated issues drug
interactions significant toxicity. however, greater understanding baseline
factors contribute better prediction treatment outcome, monitoring 
of on-treatment virological responses increasingly allows individualization of
therapy. possible, treatment hcv often advisable haart is
required avoid issues drug interactions hcv therapy risk 
haart-related hepatotoxicity. early diagnosis hiv hcv infection is
essential effectively manage hiv-hcv-coinfected individuals. new
therapies, including hcv protease polymerase inhibitors, development
and may widen therapeutic options hiv-hcv-coinfected individuals the
future.
