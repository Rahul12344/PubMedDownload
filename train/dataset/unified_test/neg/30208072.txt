we characterized complete genome novel circular double-stranded dna
virus, tentatively named dioscorea nummularia-associated virus (dnuav), infecting
dioscorea nummularia originating samoa. genome dnuav comprised 8139
bp contained four putative open reading frames (orfs). orfs 1 2 no
identifiable conserved domains, orf 3 conserved motifs typical of
viruses within family caulimoviridae including coat protein, movement
protein, aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase ribonuclease h. a
transactivator domain, similar present members several
caulimoviridae genera, also identified putative orf 4. genome
size, organization, presence conserved amino acid domains similar to
other viruses family caulimoviridae. however, based nucleotide sequence
similarity phylogenetic analysis, dnuav appears distinct novel member
of family may represent new genus.
