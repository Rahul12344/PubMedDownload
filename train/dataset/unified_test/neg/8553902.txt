at present time, system signals required isotype
switching better understood ige system. ige switching therefore
becoming general model "directed" isotype switching mice humans. the
study ige regulation proposed paradigm general importance for
immunology nineties, namely, requirement least two signals in
order trigger final event, case dna switch recombination the
ige isotype. first signal delivered cytokine, il-4 il-13, is
responsible choice isotype. second signal typically
delivered upon engagement cd40 b cells cd40 ligand expressed t
cells, results switching production ige. shall herein discuss
the two-signal model ige switching detail, stressing particular the
cross-talk signals, mechanisms responsible ige amplification.
