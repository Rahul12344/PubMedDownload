the high immunogenicity recombinant adenoviral vectors one major
issues field gene therapy. adenoviral-based vectors susceptible
both cytotoxic t-lymphocyte humoral immune responses. addition, leaky
adenoviral genes also render transduced cells susceptible host immune
responses. main reasons adenoviral-based vectors not
suitable correct genetic disorders, require long-term expression 
transgene. another limit long-term transgene expression posed fact
that adenoviral-based vectors integrate genome cellular
chromosomal dna transduced cell populations. stands, adenoviral-mediated
gene transfer promising tool cancer therapy genetic immunization
programs infectious diseases, provided host immune responses are
carefully controlled.
