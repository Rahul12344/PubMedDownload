to define best marker follow-up evaluation hcv infections we
determined anti-hcv antibodies, serum transaminases hcv rna patients
diagnosed chronic hepatitis c virus treated alpha-interferon.
the presence/absence hcv rna determined serum, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc) lymphocyte subpopulations. samples submitted to
rt-pcr subsequent nested pcr. treatment alpha-interferon induced fall 
in number hcv rna positive patients initial 88 25% end
of treatment. withdrawal treatment associated significant
increase number hcv rna positive patients (43% 12-month
follow-up). 61% patients pcr analysis pbmc population
detected presence hcv rna. 87% cases cell fraction identified as
cd19 resulted positive pcr test viral genome undetectable in
pbmc subpopulations 13% cases. one third patients whose
serum negative pcr analysis demonstrated presence hcv rna in
pbmc. conclusions: disappearance viral genome serum, criterion of
treatment response, necessarily followed disappearance pbmc. the
joint determination hcv pcr technique serum blood cells be
used particular instrument patient.
