hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) third leading cause cancer-related death
worldwide. recently, comprehensive whole genome exome sequencing analyses for
hcc revealed new cancer-associated genes variety genomic alterations. in
particular, frequent genetic alterations chromatin remodeling genes were
observed, suggesting new potential therapeutic target hcc. sequencing
analysis identified molecular complexities multicentric
lesions intratumoral heterogeneity. detailed analyses somatic
substitution pattern cancer genome hbv virus genome integration
sites using whole-genome sequencing elucidate molecular basis and
diverse etiological factors involved liver cancer development.
