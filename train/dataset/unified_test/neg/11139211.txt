a novel blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bl-elisa) developed for
detection antibodies human group c rotavirus (chrv). specificity the
bl-elisa confirmed using animal sera hyperimmunized group group c
rotaviruses paired sera five patients acute chrv gastroenteritis.
furthermore, concordance bl-elisa neutralization
assay chrv 226 (95%) 238 samples. using bl-elisa, determined 
the seroprevalence chrv 704 serum samples obtained nine different age 
groups inhabitants okayama prefecture, japan, 1992, 1994, 1996. a
result, 211 sera (30%) found positive chrv antibodies. the
seroprevalence gradually increased age reached 52.7% oldest
individuals. analysis youngest age group suggested chrvs
predominantly prevail persons older 3 years age japan. when
comparing three sampling years, larger percentage antibody-positive sera
was detected 1994 either 1992 1996 individuals 6 15 
years age, reflecting occurrence chrv outbreak among children 
the winter 1992 1993 previously documented. results indicate
that chrv infections may occur frequently spite relatively low
detection rate virus.
