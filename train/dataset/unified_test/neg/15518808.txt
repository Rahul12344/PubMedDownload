plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc), natural type-1 interferon (ifn) producing
cells, part innate immune defense human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv). pdc numbers reduced advanced stages infection. cells can
be infected vivo hiv since highly purified pdc showed evidence of
infectious hiv. moreover, pdc derived uninfected donors exposed to
high-titered hiv isolates, productive infection occurred although low-level 
replication. using real-time amplification, pdc unstimulated cd4+ cells 
found equally susceptible hiv infection; however, hiv replication was
considerably limited pdc. virus replication enhanced pdc
treatment cd40l antibodies ifn-alpha, likely reflecting the
reduction ifn-alpha activity. maturation, infected pdc showed
multinuclear cell syncytia formation death. findings indicate pdc 
can reservoirs hiv dissemination hiv infection pdc can
contribute decline.
