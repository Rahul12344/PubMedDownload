objectives: recombinant viral vectors based nonpathogenic parvovirus,
adeno-associated virus (aav), number attractive features gene
therapy, including ability transduce non-dividing cells long-term 
transgene expression. study, aav vector containing bacterial
beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) used transduce cultured rat vascular smooth
muscle cells (vsmc) vitro rat thoracic aortas ex vivo.
methods: vsmc transduced aav-lacz multiplicities infection (moi) 
ranging 5.0 x 10(5) 1.0 x 10(7). expression beta-galactosidase
(beta-gal) vsmc evaluated x-gal staining beta-gal elisa method.
excised rat aortas incubated medium containing aav-lacz. expression 
beta-gal aortic segments evaluated x-gal staining.
results: increasing moi, 50% cultured vsmc positive x-gal
staining beta-gal expression increased 15 ng/mg protein. the
expression gradually decreased culture detectable least
1 month. ex vivo study, aav vectors transduced endothelial adventitial
cells rat aortic segments, expression seen medial vsmc.
conclusions: aav vectors efficiently transduce rat vsmc vitro.
aav-mediated ex vivo gene transfer normal aorta resulted efficient
gene transfer endothelial adventitial cells medial vsmc.
these findings suggest aav-based vectors promising use in
cardiovascular gene therapy.
