middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) emerging zoonotic viral respiratory
disease first identified saudi arabia 2012. 2015, largest
mers outbreak outside middle east region occurred republic of
korea. rapid nosocomial transmission mers-coronavirus (mers-cov) korean
health care settings highlighted importance urgent need rapid and
reliable on-site diagnostic assay implement effective control preventive
measures. here, evaluation validation two newly developed reverse
transcription-insulated isothermal pcr (rt-iipcr) methods targeting orf1a and
upe genes mers-cov described. compared world health
organization-recommended singleplex real-time quantitative rt-pcr (rt-qpcr)
assays, rt-iipcr assays comparable analytical sensitivity the
detection mers-cov rna tissue culture fluid sputum samples spiked
with infectious virus. furthermore, clinical evaluation performed sputum
samples collected subjects acute chronic respiratory illnesses,
including patients infected mers-cov. overall agreement values between
the two rt-iipcr assays reference rt-qpcr assays 98.06% (95% ci,
94.43%-100%; κ = 0.96) 99.03% (95% ci, 95.88%-100%; κ = 0.99) orf1a and
upe assays, respectively. orf1a upe mers-cov rt-iipcr assays coupled with
a field-deployable system provide platform highly sensitive specific 
on-site tool diagnosis mers-cov infections.
