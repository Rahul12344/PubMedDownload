rotavirus infection one common causes diarrheal illness in
humans. neonatal mice, rhesus rotavirus (rrv) induce biliary atresia (ba),
a disease resulting inflammatory obstruction extrahepatic biliary tract
and intrahepatic bile ducts. previously showed amino acid arginine
(r) within sequence srl (amino acids 445 447) rrv vp4 protein is
required viral binding entry biliary epithelial cells. determine 
if single amino acid (r) influences pathogenicity virus, we
generated recombinant virus single amino acid mutation site
through reverse genetics system. demonstrated rrv mutant
(rrvvp4-r446g) produced less symptomatology replicated lower titers both
in vivo vitro seen wild-type rrv, reduced binding 
cholangiocytes. results demonstrate single amino acid change the
rrv vp4 gene influences cholangiocyte tropism reduces pathogenicity in
mice.importance rotavirus leading cause diarrhea humans. rhesus
rotavirus (rrv) also lead biliary atresia (a neonatal human disease) in
mice. developed reverse genetics system create mutant rrv
(rrvvp4-r446g) single amino acid change vp4 protein compared to
that wild-type rrv. vitro, mutant virus reduced binding and
infectivity cholangiocytes. vivo, produced fewer symptoms lower
mortality neonatal mice, resulting attenuated form biliary atresia.
