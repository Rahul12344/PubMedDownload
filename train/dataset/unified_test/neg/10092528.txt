the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (sv40 tag) ascribed many
functions critical viral propagation, including binding mammalian tumor
suppressor p53. recent studies demonstrated sv40-transformed murine
cells functional p53. status p53 sv40-immortalized human cells,
however, characterized. found response ionizing
radiation, p53-dependent p21 transactivation activity present, albeit reduced,
in sv40-immortalized cells activity reduced with
either dominant negative p53 expression higher sv40 tag expression.
furthermore, overexpression p53 sv40-immortalized ataxia-telangiectasia
(a-t) cells restores p53-dependent p21 induction typical a-t levels. all
sv40-immortalized cell lines exhibited absence g1 arrest. moreover, all
sv40-immortalized cell lines exhibited increased apoptosis relative primary
cells response ionizing radiation, suggesting sv40 immortalization
results unique phenotype regard dna damage responses.
