we analyzed relative level gene expression viral titer from
different types retroviral vectors used gene therapy, ltr-based mfg
vector internal promoter-containing vectors, lncx, lnsx lxsn. cat
gene used comparison retroviral vector gene expression both
transfected transduced cells, neo gene used evaluate viral
liter. transfected cells, mfg-cat expressed higher levels cat the
other vectors, lnc-cat next, l-cat-sn lns-cat produced much lower
levels. cat expression mfg-cat particularly high human lymphoid
cell lines cem-ss h9. nonselected transduced cells. cat expression from
mfg 10- 50-fold higher vectors. similar observations
were made retroviral constructs expressing human epo murine gm-csf. in
transient transfection assays, titer mfg least five-fold higher
than vectors determined southern analysis g418 resistance.
analysis steady-state rnas produced transfection packaging
cell lines showed mfg expressed significantly higher level genomic rna,
which contains packaging signal, vectors still
expressing high level subgenomic rna encoding cat. high level of
genomic rna likely contributes directly higher titer mfg. also 
compared viral titers subcloned pa317 producer lines containing lnc-cat 
mfg-cat-neo, confirmed titer mfg virus higher that
of lncx. selected subcloned transduced nih3t3 cells, average levels cat
activity nine-fold higher mfg-based vector. results suggest that
there significant differences titer level gene
expression retroviral vectors currently used gene
therapy clinical trials.
