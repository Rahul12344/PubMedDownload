the complete nucleotide sequences vp2 segments bluetongue virus (btv)
isolates recovered italy, greece israel, 1998 2003, were
determined. phylogenetic analysis sequences, related viruses 
and south african vaccine strains, used determine probable
geographic origin btv incursions italy. results indicated viruses
from four serotypes isolated italy (2, 4, 9 16) possibly a
different origin. analysis bluetongue virus serotype 2 (btv-2) isolates
gave evidence serotype probably moved tunisia. btv-4 results
showed probable incursion southwest greece israel. btv-9
isolates clearly eastern origin (most probably greece), whereas btv-16
isolates indistinguishable btv-16 live attenuated vaccine strain.
the phylogenetic findings supported polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(page) analysis complete amplified genome isolate except for
btv-16 italian field isolate, showed slightly different page profile. a
combination complete vp2 sequencing page analysis complete genomes,
allowed phylogenetic analysis, also vaccine detection assessment
of reassortment events.
