the effect long non-coding rna (lncrna) thor proliferation migration of
colon cancer cells investigated. lentiviral vector expressing lncrna thor
shrna used establish colon cancer sw620 lncrna thor knockdown cell line
(experimental group), time, control vector cell line (control
group) established empty vector virus. proliferation ability two
groups analyzed cck8 edu methods. migration ability cells was
analyzed transwell method. xenograft tumor method used analyze in
vivo proliferation ability two groups cells. mrna levels lncrna thor
target genes analyzed reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr).
compared control cells, cell proliferation ability experimental
group significantly decreased (p<0.05). compared control group, 
cell migration ability experimental group significantly decreased
(p<0.05). tumor growth rate experimental group mice was
significantly lower control group (p<0.05). compared the
control group, mrna levels lncrna thor target genes igf2bp1, sox9 c-myc in
the experimental group significantly downregulated (p<0.05). results
indicated lncrna thor knockdown significantly downregulate the
expression genes involved tumor proliferation migration, promote tumor 
cell proliferation migration, indicating lncrna thor plays important 
role colon cancer.
