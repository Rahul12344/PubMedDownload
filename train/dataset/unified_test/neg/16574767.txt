acute chronic alcohol abuse impairs various functions immune system
and thus, implicated cofactor immunopathogenesis human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) disease progression. determined whether
naltrexone, opioid receptor antagonist widely used treatment of
alcoholism, inhibits alcohol-mediated enhancement hiv infection cells.
alcohol enhanced hiv infection peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) human 
lymphoid cell line (cemx174). alcohol increased hiv x4 envelope (env), murine
leukemia virus env-pseudotyped infection cemx174 cells. naltrexone antagonized
the enhancing effect alcohol hiv infection pbl cemx174 cells. the
specific mu-opioid receptor antagonist, cys2, tyr3, arg5, pen7 (ctap) amide, also
blocked enhancing effect alcohol hiv infection. investigation the
underlying mechanism alcohol action showed alcohol significantly
increased endogenous beta-endorphin production induced mu-opioid receptor
mrna expression pbl cemx174 cells. role beta-endorphin in
alcohol-mediated enhancement hiv infection indicated observations
that naltrexone ctap antagonized ether alcohol- exogenous
beta-endorphin-mediated enhancement hiv infection. findings suggest a
biological mechanism potential therapeutic benefit naltrexone in
treating hiv-infected alcoholics.
