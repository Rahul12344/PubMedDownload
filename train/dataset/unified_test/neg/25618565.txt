the immune system plays critical role prevention infectious and
chronic disease. investigate associations exposure neighborhood
immigrant concentration across transition adolescence adulthood and
immune function among latino young adults, including moderation nativity. data
from national longitudinal study adolescent health (1994-2008) were
analyzed. immune function measured via epstein-barr virus (ebv) antibody
levels (higher levels indicate impaired immune function) among ebv-positive
latino adults (n=1130). results indicated averaged individual exposure to
immigrant concentration (mean % foreign-born residents census tract
across waves 1-4) associated immune function foreign-born latinos
only (b=-0.37, p<0.05). waves exposure, cumulative measure of
living immigrant enclave (census tracts ≥40% foreign-born residents)
across waves associated immune function foreign-born
latinos (b=-0.22, p<0.05). research mechanisms neighborhood 
immigrant concentration confers salubrious physiological outcomes for
foreign-born latinos needed.
