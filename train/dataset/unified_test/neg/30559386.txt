multidrug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae nosocomial pathogen, produces
septicemia, pneumonia uti. excessive use antibiotics contributes towards
emergence multidrug-resistance. bacteriophage-therapy potential
substitute antibiotics many advantages. investigation,
microbiological genome characterization tsk1 bacteriophage biofilm
elimination capability presented. tsk1 showed narrow host range highest
stability ph 7 37 °c. tsk1 reduced growth k. pneumoniae 
initial 14 hours infection. post-treatment tsk1 different age k. 
pneumoniae biofilms reduced 85-100% biomass. pre-treatment tsk1 bacteriophage 
against biofilm klebsiella pneumoniae reduced > 99% biomass initial
24 hr incubation. genome tsk1 phage comprised 49,836 base pairs gc
composition 50.44%. total seventy-five open reading frames (orfs) were
predicted, 25 showed homology known functional proteins, 50 were
called hypothetical, homologs proved function exists genome
databases. blast phylogenetic analysis put kp36 virus genus of
family siphoviridae. proposed packaging strategy tsk1 bacteriophage genome 
headful packaging using pac sites. potential tsk1 bacteriophage could 
be used reduce bacterial load biofilm clinical non-clinical
settings.
