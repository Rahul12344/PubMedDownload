entry hiv-1 host cells remains compelling yet elusive target for
developing agents prevent infection. peptide triazole (pt) class entry
inhibitor previously shown bind hiv-1 gp120, suppress interactions
of env protein host cell receptor binding sites, inhibit cell infection,
and cause envelope spike protein breakdown, including gp120 shedding and, for
some variants, virus membrane lysis. found gold nanoparticle-conjugated
forms peptide triazoles (aunp-pt) exhibit substantially potent antiviral 
effects hiv-1 corresponding peptide triazoles alone. here, sought
to reveal mechanism potency enhancement underlying nanoparticle conjugate 
function. found altering physical properties nanoparticle
conjugate, increasing aunp diameter and/or density pt conjugated on
the aunp surface, enhanced potency infection inhibition impressive
picomolar levels. further, compared unconjugated pt, aunp-pt less
susceptible reduction antiviral potency density pt-competent
env spikes virus reduced incorporating peptide-resistant mutant
gp120. conclude potency enhancement virolytic activity and
corresponding irreversible hiv-1 inactivation pts upon aunp conjugation
derives multivalent contact nanoconjugates metastable env
spikes hiv-1 virus. findings reveal multispike engagement can
exploit metastability built virus envelope irreversibly
inactivate hiv-1 provide conceptual platform design nanoparticle-based
antiviral agents hiv-1 specifically putatively metastable enveloped
viruses generally.
