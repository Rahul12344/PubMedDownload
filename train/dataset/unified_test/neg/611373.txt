naturally acquired immunity influenza type a: prospective study.

gill pw, murphy am.

during 1976 influenza epidemic, incidence severity attack by
a/victoria/3/75 strain studied 312 participants divided two
groups: group 1 216 participants history laboratory-proven
infection one earlier strains hong kong subtype; group 2 96 
participants known history prior infection. participant 
either group received influenza vaccine. efficacy clinical immunity,
acquired result prior infection earlier hong kong subtype strain,
was judged comparing findings group 1 group 2. incidence of
laboratory-proven a/victoria/3/75 infection found 27% group 2 (26
cases confirmed) 10.6% group 1 (23 cases confirmed). among group 1
members, incidence highest longest interval since prior
hong kong subtype infection. severe influenzal illness seen 14 26
proven cases group 2, three 23 proven cases group 1. the
prior infection three a/hong kong/1/68 strain 1969-1970. 
thus group 1, severe influenzal illness observed six years or
more passed since prior infection (and three episodes antigenic drift 
intervened). results suggested low serum antibody levels may unreliable
as indicators clinical immunity. preepidemic sera 99 members group 1 and
82 members group 2 showed hai antibody a/victoria/3/75 (titre less 
8), incidence laboratory-proven a/victoria/3/75 infection among 
individuals lower group 1 (19%) group 2 (30.5%).
