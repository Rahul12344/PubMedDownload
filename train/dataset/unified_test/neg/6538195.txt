synthetic tyrosine polymers substrates inhibitors tyrosine-specific
protein kinases.

braun s, raymond we, racker e.

several synthetic random polymers tyrosine containing glutamic acid, alanine, 
and lysine various proportion served substrates tyrosine-specific
protein kinases. km values substrates much lower for
small polypeptides angiotensin. protein kinase coded fujinami 
virus, best substrates (with lowest km) polymers containing glutamic
acid, alanine, 8 10% tyrosine; insulin receptor protein kinase,
the best substrate polymer containing 80% glutamic acid 20% tyrosine.
these polymers serve inexpensive tyrosine-specific substrates 
used even crude extracts analyzed convenient filter paper assay. 
several synthetic polymers ordered sequences found potent
inhibitors tyrosine-specific protein kinases.
