background: isolation novel retroviral restriction factors open new
avenues anti-hiv/aids treatment. although hiv-1 replication restricted 
apobec3g/apobec3f, trim5alpha, cd317, none defend hiv-1 infection under
natural conditions. previously, demonstrated host factor human t
cell line cem.nkr potently restricted wild-type hiv-1 replication.
interestingly, restriction resembled apobec3g/apobec3f pattern that
viral replication inhibited second round replication cycle a
post-entry step.
results: here, characterized factor found distinguishable 
from known anti-hiv apobec3 proteins. although cem.nkr cells expressed both
apobec3g apobec3f, levels least 10 4-fold lower those
in h9 cells, importantly, vif effectively neutralized activity. among
eight subclones isolated cem.nkr cells, one relatively permissive, four 
were semi-permissive, three completely non-permissive hiv-1
replication. levels apobec3 expression determined, these
clones retained similar low levels apobec3de, apobec3f, apobec3g apobec3h 
expression, apobec3b expression detected. since vif sivmac
can effectively neutralize apobec3b apobec3h, recombinant hiv-1 expressing
this siv gene created. however, viruses still failed replicate in
cem.nkr cells. also confirmed hiv-1 restriction cem.nkr due to
a loss calnexin expression.
conclusion: taken together, results demonstrate these
aforementioned anti-hiv apobec3 proteins contribute hiv-1
restriction, also shed light novel potent hiv-1 inhibitor cem.nkr
cells.
