heterogeneous chromatographic behaviour soluble rna replicase healthy and
virus-infected tobacco leaves: improvement purification methodology.

sommer p, andriamanantena ag, stussigaraud c.

during purification soluble rna replicase healthy alfalfa mosaic
virus-infected tobacco leaves, crude extracts chromatographed on
deae-sephadex a-25, three rna-dependent rna polymerase activities were
obtained; one previously characterized true rna replicase, 
remaining two studied (chifflot et al., 1980, virology 100, 91). 
demonstrate activities correspond rna replicase,
complexed cellular viral rna. upon chromatography deae-sephadex
a-25, free replicase bind gel low ionic strength, whereas
the rna-replicase complexes bound gel medium rna.
increasing ionic strength allowed dissociation complexes and
elution replicase only. observation, new rapid
purification procedure combining activities yielding large amounts 
of replicase developed; first main step purification was
chromatography blue-sepharose cl6b conditions conductive the
dissociation rna-replicase complexes, thus maximal adsorption the
replicase. enzyme eluted increasing ionic strength was
further purified coupled deae-sephadex a-25 phosphocellulose columns. 
dea-sephadex a-25 used bind remaining rna, replicase passed 
through, bound cationic ion exchanger. final replicase
preparations obtained stable purification factor
of 1100-1400. recovery averaged 70% specific activities much higher 
than already described similar enzymes healthy virus-infected
tobacco leaves.
