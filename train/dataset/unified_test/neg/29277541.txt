chemokines regulate tissue immunity recruiting specific subsets immune
cells. mice expressing e7 protein human papilloma virus 16 transgene 
from keratin 14 promoter (k14.e7) show increased epidermal dermal
lymphocytic infiltrates, epidermal hyperplasia, suppressed local immunity.
here, show cxcl9 cxcl10 overexpressed non-hematopoietic cells 
in skin k14.e7 mice compared non-transgenic animals, recruit
cxcr3+ lymphocytes hyperplastic skin. overexpression cxcl9 cxcl10
is observed e7 transgenic mice mutated rb gene whose protein product 
cannot interact e7 (k14.e7xrbδl/δl) consequence lack hyperplastic
epithelium. cxcr3+ cells preferentially recruited cxcl9 cxcl10 in
supernatants k14.e7 k14.e7xrbδl/δl skin cultures in vitro. cxcr3
signalling promotes infiltration subset effector lymphocytes that
enables donor lymphocyte deficient, e7-expressing skin graft rejection. taken
together, suggests recruitment cxcr3+ cells important
factor rejection precancerous skin epithelium providing can
overcome local immunosuppressive mechanisms driven skin-resident lymphocytes.
