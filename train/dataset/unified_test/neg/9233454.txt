objectives: study role hiv-1 biological phenotype, viral load and
neutralizing antibodies male-to-female heterosexual transmission hiv-1.
methods: seven transmitting seven non-transmitting hiv-1-seropositive
heterosexual male index cases included present study. couples had
engaged unprotected sex period 1 year. transmission defined 
by seroconversion female sexual partner. virus isolates tested in
mt-2 cells replication syncytia induction. hiv-1 rna plasma load was
measured branched dna technique. serum neutralizing activity primary
hiv-1 isolates tested using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) as
target cells.
results: non-transmitting index cases lower hiv-1 rna concentration in
plasma transmitting index cases. non-transmitting index cases also tended to
have serum neutralizing activity broad specificity viruses 
low replicative capacity, characterized 50% infectious dose titres pbmc 
and lack mt-2 tropism.
conclusions: results indicate plasma viral-rna load marker for
transmission. moreover, interplay host immune response viral
replication may modulate level viral load thereby influence hiv-1
transmission.
