isolation mapping escherichia coli k12 mutants defective tn9
transposition.

ilyina ts, nechaeva ev, romanova yum, smirnov gb.

five mutants (called tnm) escherichia coli impaired ability for
transposition tn9 isolated treatment ethyl methanesulfonate
(ems) n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (ng). map locations tnm 
mutations determined combination hfr matings, f' episome
complementation p1 transductional mapping. data obtained show the
five tnm mutations located near 91 min escherichia coli linkage map
and cotransducible meta marker frequency 3%-4%.
introduction f' plasmids containing region complements tnm- phenotype
for two mutants tested i.e. tnm-1 tnm-2 recessive tnm+/tnm-
merodiploids.
