two live attenuated single-deletion mutant simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)
constructs, siv239deltanef sivpbj6.6deltanef, tested abilities
to stimulate protective immunity macaques. immunization period 
animals examined specific immune responses virus growth. each
construct generated high levels specific immunity immunized
animals. siv239deltanef construct found grow high levels all
immunized animals, animals remaining positive virus isolation and
plasma rna throughout immunization period. sivpbj6.6deltanef was
effectively controlled immunized animals, virus mostly
isolated first months following immunization plasma rna
never detected. following extended period immunization 80 weeks,
the animals challenged pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus
(shiv) isolate, siv89. 6pd, intravenous injection. the
siv239deltanef-immunized animals became infected shiv isolate; two of
five animals eventually controlled challenge three five animals, which
failed check immunizing virus, progressed disease state the
unvaccinated controls. one five animals immunized sivpbj6.6deltanef
totally resisted infection challenge virus, three others limited its
growth remaining animal became persistently infected eventually died 
of pulmonary thrombus. data indicate vaccination attenuated siv
can protect macaques disease cases infection divergent
shiv. however, animals unable control immunizing virus, potential
damage accelerate disease course pathogenic challenge virus may
occur.
