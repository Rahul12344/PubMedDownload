mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) multipotent cells reside many tissues 
and give rise multiple lineages including bone, cartilage adipose.
although mscs attracted significant attention basic translational
research, primary mscs limited life span culture hampers mscs'
broader applications. here, investigate mouse mesenchymal progenitors can
be conditionally immortalized sv40 large antigen maintain long-term
cell proliferation without compromising multipotency. using system
which expresses sv40 large antigen flanked cre/loxp sites, demonstrate 
that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) efficiently immortalized sv40
large antigen. conditionally immortalized mefs (imefs) exhibit enhanced 
proliferative activity maintain long-term cell proliferation, be
reversed cre recombinase. imefs express msc markers retain
multipotency differentiate osteogenic, chondrogenic and
adipogenic lineages appropriate differentiation conditions vitro 
vivo. removal sv40 large reduces differentiation potential imefs 
possibly due decreased progenitor expansion. furthermore, imefs are
apparently tumorigenic subcutaneously injected athymic
nude mice. thus, conditionally immortalized imefs maintain long-term
cell proliferation also retain ability differentiate multiple
lineages. results suggest reversible immortalization strategy using 
sv40 large antigen may efficient safe approach establishing
long-term cell culture primary mesenchymal progenitors basic and
translational research, well potential clinical applications.
