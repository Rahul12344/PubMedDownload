previous studies demonstrated immunization macaques simian
immunodeficiency virus (siv) gag-pol env recombinants attenuated
poxvirus modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) provided protection high
viremia aids following challenge pathogenic strain siv. although
all animals became infected, plasma viremia significantly reduced animals 
that received mva-siv recombinant vaccines compared animals that
received nonrecombinant mva. importantly, reduction viremia resulted 
in significant increase median cumulative survival. continued analysis
of animals subsequent 9 years shown maintain a
survival advantage, although two macaques progressed aids.
importantly, improved survival correlated preservation memory cd4(+) t
cells peripheral blood. greatest survival advantage observed in
macaques immunized regimens containing siv env, titer of
neutralizing antibodies challenge virus prior shortly following
challenge correlated preservation cd4(+) cells. data are
consistent role neutralizing antibodies nonsterilizing protection
from high viremia associated memory cd4(+) t-cell loss.
