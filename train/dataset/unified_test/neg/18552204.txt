il-33 novel member il-1 cytokine family potent inducer type 
2 immunity, mast cells th2 cd4+ cells respond il-33 the
induction type 2 cytokines il-13. il-33 mrna levels extremely high
in cns, cns glia possess subunits il-33r, yet whether il-33
is produced affects cns glia studied. here, demonstrate
that pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) significantly increase il-33 
mrna protein expression cns glia. interestingly, il-33 localized to
the nucleus astrocytes. further, cns glial astrocyte-enriched cultures
treated pamp followed atp pulse significantly higher levels of
supernatant il-1beta il-33 cultures receiving single treatment (pamp
or atp). supernatants pamp + atp-treated glia induced secretion il-6,
il-13, mcp-1 mc/9 mast cell line manner similar exogenous
recombinant il-33. further, il-33 levels activity increased the
brains mice infected neurotropic virus theiler's murine
encephalomyelitis virus. il-33 also direct effects cns glia, il-33
induced various innate immune effectors cns glia, induction was
greatly amplified il-33-stimulated mast cells. conclusion, results
implicate il-33-producing astrocytes potentially critical regulator of
innate immune responses cns.
