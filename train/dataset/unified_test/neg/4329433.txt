detection foot-and-mouth disease virus antibodies. ii. use fractionated
bovine antisera improving specificity "passive" hemagglutination
test.

warrington re, kawakami y.

because 7s immunoglobulin (ig) g antibodies low type specificity present 
in mixtures highly specific 19s igm antibodies, many bovine antisera to
foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) type a(12), strain 119 cross-reacted with
type fmdv degree type c passive hemagglutination
(ha) test. 19s igm antibodies separated density gradient
centrifugation precipitated 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, antigen
could determined "block" ha tests. tests used several antigen
concentrations titration antiserum. adding 4% (w/v) polyethylene
glycol serum especially convenient rapid precipitation 19s igm 
antibodies test. similar results obtained bovine 19s igm
antibodies fmdv type o, subtype 1, strain caseros type c strain rezende.
