virus-like particles (vlps) based small envelope protein hepatitis b
virus (hbsag-s) immunogenic b- t-cell level. study, we
inserted overlapping sequences encoding carboxy terminus helicobacter 
pylori kata gene product hbsag-s. hbsag-s-kata fusion proteins able
to assemble secretion-competent vlps (vlp-kata). vlp-kata proteins 
able induce kata-specific antibodies immunized mice. mean total igg
antibody titers 41 days post-primary immunization vlp-kata (2.3 × 10(3))
were significantly greater (p < 0.05) observed vaccination with
vlp alone (5.2 × 10(2)). measurement igg isotypes revealed responses both
igg1 igg2a (mean titers, 9.0 × 10(4) 2.6 × 10(4), respectively), the
igg2a response vaccination vlp-kata significantly higher 
for mice immunized kata alone (p < 0.05). following challenge mice with
h. pylori, significantly reduced bacterial load gastric mucosa was
observed (p < 0.05). first report describing use vlps a
delivery vehicle h. pylori antigens.
