this paper describes characteristics human amniotic epithelial cells (aec)
transfected gene origin-defective simian virus (sv) 40 large t-antigen 
(pmtiod). normal aec transfection pmtiod exhibited low
proliferative potential culture conditions. hand, aec
cells transfected pmtiod exhibited greater proliferative potentials. flow
cytometry immunohistochemistry analyses showed primary 
transfected aec express appreciable levels class ii antigens. however,
the expression class antigen transfected aec cells slightly
increased. cells obtained experiment ability induce
tumors severely combined immunodeficiency mice. finding suggests that
established aec line used tool investigate possible expression 
the desired gene human aec gene products, however, suitable as
a gene carrier recipient. experiments required to
establish aec transgene carrier somatic cell gene therapy.
