human papillomavirus (hpv) infection, especially oncogenic genotypes, is
the important risk factor developing cervical cancer. focused on
generating hpv16 e7-specific cytotoxic cd8(+) lymphocytes evaluating hpv16 
e7-specific immune responses hpv16-infected uninfected populations.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) first collected an
uninfected group human lymphocyte antigen (hla) a2 haplotype (four
volunteers). mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs) generated from
the pbmcs pulsed one two hla-a2-restricted e7 peptides, aa 11-20
[ymldlqpett] aa 86-93 [tlgivcpi], antigen presenting cells. autologous
naive cultured pbmcs cultured peptide-pulsed dcs detect 
hpv16 e7-specific immune responses variety techniques as
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot)
assay cytotoxic lymphocyte assay. interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) from
e7-specific cytotoxic cd8(+) lymphocytes stimulated respective peptide
was detected elisa. using elispot analysis, marked increase number of
ifn-gamma-secreting cd8(+) e7-specific lymphocytes observed following peptide
stimulation. cultured cd8(+) lymphocytes highly cytotoxic the
caski cells. pbmcs collected hpv16-infected population the
hla-a2 haplotype, including four persons hpv16 infection only, four with
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) lesions, four cervical cancer
patients. compared immunologic responses e7 hpv16-infected
and uninfected populations elisa elispot assay. e7-specific
immunologic responses hpv16-infected populations significantly higher
than uninfected population. addition, persons hpv16
infection cin lesions generated higher e7-specific immunologic
responses cervical cancer patients. results demonstrate methods for
evaluating e7-specific immunologic responses reflect biological responses
of hpv16-infected people different periods cervical disease.
