limited production capacity delays vaccine development major obstacles
to vaccination programs designed mitigate pandemic influenza. in
order evaluate compare impact various vaccination strategies during
a pandemic influenza, developed age/risk-structured model influenza
transmission, parameterized epidemiological data 2009 h1n1
influenza pandemic. model predicts impact vaccination would 
considerably diminished delays vaccination staggered vaccine supply.
nonetheless, prioritizing limited h1n1 vaccine individuals high risk of
complications, followed school-age children, preschool-age children, 
would minimize overall attack rate well hospitalizations deaths.
this vaccination scheme would maximize benefits vaccination protecting 
the high-risk people directly, generating indirect protection vaccinating 
children likely transmit disease.
