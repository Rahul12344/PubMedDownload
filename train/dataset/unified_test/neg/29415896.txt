type 1 diabetes (t1d) chronic disease characterized an
autoimmune-mediated destruction insulin-producing pancreatic β cells.
environmental factors viruses play important role onset t1d 
and interact predisposing genes. recent data suggest viral infection of
human islets leads decrease insulin production rather β cell death, 
suggesting loss β cell identity. undertook study examine whether
viral infection could induce human β cell dedifferentiation. using functional
human β cell line endoc-βh1, demonstrate polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 
(polyi:c), synthetic double-stranded rna mimics byproduct viral
replication, induces decrease β cell-specific gene expression. parallel
with loss, expression progenitor-like genes sox9 was
activated following polyi:c treatment enteroviral infection. sox9 induced 
by nf-κb pathway also paracrine non-cell-autonomous fashion 
the secretion ifn-α. lastly, identified sox9 targets human β cells as
potentially new markers dedifferentiation t1d. findings reveal that
inflammatory signaling clear implications human β cell dedifferentiation.
