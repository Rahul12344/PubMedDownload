we used activity gel analysis immunoblotting provide evidence linking
the hepatitis b virus (hbv) reverse transcriptase longest unassigned
open reading frame (polymerase [pol]-orf). activity gel analysis demonstrated
that infectious hbv particles secreted hep 2.2.15 cell line contain major 
(approximately 70 kilodaltons [kda]) minor (approximately 90 kda) reverse
transcriptase activities. western immunoblotting, detected hbv
particles hep 2.2.15 cell extract approximately 70-kda pol-specific
peptide. approximately 70-kda peptide reacted antisera directed against
the carboxy terminus pol gene product. immunoreactivity was
observed antisera amino terminus pol peptide. reverse
transcriptase protein eluted major approximately 70-kda region
detected activity gel reacted pol-specific antisera. furthermore,
reverse transcriptase activity immunoprecipitated dissociated hbv
particles using pol-specific antisera. basis results, suggest
that hbv encodes reverse transcriptase pol-orf.
