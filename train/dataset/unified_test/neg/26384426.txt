in contrast bacteria two release factors, rf1 rf2, eukaryotes
only possess one unrelated release factor erf1, recognizes three stop
codons mrna hydrolyses peptidyl-trna bond. molecular
basis bacterial termination elucidated, high-resolution structures
of eukaryotic termination complexes lacking. present 3.8 å
structure human translation termination complex erf1 decoding uaa(a) 
stop codon. complex formed using human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)
stalling peptide, perturbs peptidyltransferase center (ptc) silence 
the hydrolysis activity erf1. moreover, unlike sense codons bacterial stop 
codons, uaa stop codon adopts u-turn-like conformation within pocket
formed erf1 ribosome. inducing u-turn conformation stop codon 
recognition rationalizes decoding erf1 includes monitoring geometry in
order discriminate sense codons.
