plant mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) represented tobacco
wounding-induced protein kinase (wipk) unique regulation level of
transcription response stresses. using transcriptional translational
inhibitors, shown previously wipk gene expression de novo
protein synthesis required high-level activity wipk cells
treated elicitins phytophthora spp. however, regulation wipk
expression role(s) wipk plant disease resistance unknown. in
this report, demonstrate wipk gene transcription regulated by
phosphorylation de-phosphorylation events. interestingly, salicylic
acid-induced protein kinase (sipk) identified kinase involved in
regulating wipk gene expression based gain-of-function and
loss-of-function analyses. finding revealed additional level of
interaction sipk wipk, share upstream mapkk, ntmek2.
depending whether wipk shares downstream targets sipk, could
either function positive feed-forward regulator sipk initiate new
pathway. consistent first scenario, co-expression wipk the
active mutant ntmek2 leads accelerated hypersensitive response (hr)-like
cell death sipk also plays role. mutagenesis analysis revealed that
the conserved common docking domain wipk required function.
together prior reports (i) wipk activated nn tobacco infected
with tobacco mosaic virus, (ii) pvx virus-induced gene silencing wipk
attenuated n gene-mediated resistance, concluded wipk plays positive
role plant disease resistance, possibly accelerating the
pathogen-induced hr cell death.
