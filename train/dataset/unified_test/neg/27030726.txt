bacteriophages play important role host-driven biological processes by
controlling bacterial population size, horizontally transferring genes between
hosts expressing host-derived genes alter host metabolism. metagenomics
provides genetic basis understanding interplay uncultured
bacteria, phage environment. particular, viral metagenomes
(viromes) providing new insight phage-encoded host genes (i.e. auxiliary
metabolic genes; amgs) reprogram host metabolism infection. yet,
despite deep sequencing efforts viral communities, majority sequences
have match known proteins. reference-independent computational techniques, 
such protein clustering, contig spectra ecological profiling are
overcoming barriers examine known unknown components of
viromes. field viral metagenomics progresses, critical assessment 
tools required majority algorithms developed analyzing
bacteria. aim paper offer overview current computational 
methodologies virome analysis provide example of
reference-independent approaches using human skin viromes. additionally, we
present methods carefully validate amgs host contamination. despite
computational challenges, new methods offer novel insights the
diversity functional roles phages diverse environments.
