twenty-five 13- 35-amino-acid-long peptides representing regions human
immunodeficiency virus type 2 (hiv-2), strain sbl6669, envelope proteins were
evaluated immunogenic activity guinea pigs. peptides were
selected provide homologous representation sites hiv-1 envelope
proteins previously documented particular immunogenic
importance. number hiv-2 peptides found capable inducing
strain sbl6669 neutralizing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc)
antibodies. two overlapping peptides covering amino acids 311-337 representing
the central c-terminal part variable third (v3) region, terminology
according modrow et al. [modrow, s., hahn, b., shaw, g. m., gallo, r. c.,
wong-staal, f. & wolf, h. (1987) j. virol. 61, 570-578], showed most
pronounced capacity induce neutralizing antibodies. one peptides (amino
acids 318-337) also induced antibodies mediating adcc. two additional regions 
the large glycoprotein, gp125, containing linear sites reacting neutralizing
antibodies identified (amino acids, 119-137 472-509). transmembrane 
protein, gp36, hiv-2 harbored two regions importance induction of
neutralizing antibodies (amino acids 595-614 714-729). adcc activity was
induced two additional gp125-specific peptides (amino acids 291-311 and
446-461). thus, except single v3-specific site correlation
between linear immunogenic sites stimulating neutralizing antibody adcc
activity. findings pave way development synthetic vaccines
against hiv-2 possibly also simian immunodeficiency virus infections. the
capacity product induce protective immunity evaluated in
macaque monkeys.
