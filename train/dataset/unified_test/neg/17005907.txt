apoptotic necrotic cells expose phosphatidylserine (ps). membrane
modification ensures swift recognition uptake phagocytes dying
and dead cells. annexin v (axv) preferentially binds anionic phospholipids and
thereby, modulates clearance process. first, analyzed influence axv
on immunogenicity apoptotic cells. addition apoptotic cells axv 
prior injection mice increased immunogenicity significantly. 
next, studied influence endogenous axv allogeneic reaction
against apoptotic necrotic cells. preserve heat-labile, short-lived
"danger signals," induced necrosis mechanical stress. wild-type mice showed
a strong, allogeneic delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) reaction. contrast,
axv-deficient animals showed almost allogeneic dth reaction, indicating that
endogenous axv increases immune response dead cells. furthermore,
axv-deficient macrophages higher immunosuppressive potential vitro.
next, analyzed influence axv chronic macrophage infection with
hiv-1, known expose ps surface. infectivity human macrophages of
hiv-1 reduced significantly presence axv. finally, show axv
also blocked vitro uptake macrophages primary necrotic cells.
similar apoptotic cells, necrotic cells generated heat treatment displayed 
an anti-inflammatory activity. contrast, mechanical stress-induced necrotic
cells led decreased secretion il-10, indicating inflammatory
potential. experiments presented above, conclude axv influences 
the clearance several ps-exposing particles viruses, dying, dead
cells.
