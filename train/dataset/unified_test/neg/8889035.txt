we investigated protective effect astragali radix (ar) oral
administration japanese encephalitis virus (jev) infection mice, the
pharmacological effects ar extracts (ae) different origin, chemical
composition aes. protective effect demonstrated four aes
used, however, effective grade one different. control
group, increase hemagglutination inhibition (hi) antibody titer was
observed mice surviving 25 jev inoculation. however, increase 
of hi antibody titer observed animals administered ae. 
control group, rate hi antibody positive mice 90% 3 jev
inoculation, four groups received ae 30-60% positive
rate. mice received ae, peritoneal exudate cell (pec) numbers
increased significantly compared control group. predominant cell
population pecs mice receiving ae macrophages, pec, 
active oxygen (ao) production high. results, propose the
protective effect ae oral administration based non-specific
mechanism early stage infection, shifting antibody
production, macrophages play important role resistance jev
infection, e.g., inducing production ao. chemical composition of
each ae, carbohydrate major component.
