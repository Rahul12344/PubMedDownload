insect baculoviruses: powerful gene expression vectors.

miller lk.

baculovirus vectors proven useful producing high levels biologically
active eukaryotic proteins providing cellular fractions enriched in
the protein interest. expression occurs infected insect cells also
provide suitable environment post-translational modification folding of
the protein product. stable baculovirus vectors constructed rapidly a
minimum viral manipulation.
