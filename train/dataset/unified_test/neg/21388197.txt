this work describes approach calculating measuring dipolar
interactions multispin systems monitor conformational changes in
icosahedral protein cages using site-directed spin labeling. cowpea chlorotic
mottle virus (ccmv) used template undergoes ph-dependent
reversible capsid expansion wherein protein cage swells 10%. the
sequence-position-dependent geometric presentation attached spin-label groups 
provides strategy targeting amino acid residues probative of
structural change. labeled protein cage residues structural transition
were found affect local mobility dipolar interactions spin
label, respectively. line-shape changes provided spectral signature could 
be used follow conformational change ccmv coat dynamics. results
provide evidence concerted swelling process cages exist in
only two structural forms, essentially intermediates. methodology
can generalized symmetry types icosahedral protein architectures to
monitor protein cage dynamics.
