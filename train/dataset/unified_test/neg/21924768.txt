suicide gene therapy based combination herpes simplex virus-thymidine
kinase (hsv-tk) ganciclovir (gcv) obstacles achieving success in
clinical use treatment cancer due inadequate thymidine kinase (tk) 
expression. primary concern improving anticancer efficacy suicide 
gene therapy develop appropriate carrier highly expresses tk in
vivo. despite great advances development non-viral vectors, none has
been used cancer suicide gene therapy, even experimental challenge.
reducible poly (oligo-d-arginine) (rpoa), one effective non-viral carriers
working vivo, chosen deliver hsv-tk spinal cord tumors are
appropriate targets suicide gene therapy. since system exerts toxicity
only dividing cells, cells central nervous system, are
non-proliferative, sensitive toxic metabolites. present
study, demonstrated locomotor function model rat was
maintained tumor suppression resulting tumor-selective
suicide activity co-administration rpoa/hsv-tk gcv. thus, rpoa plays 
crucial role suicide gene therapy cancer, rpoa/hsv-tk gcv
system could help promote vivo trials suicide gene therapy.
