background: human papillomavirus (hpv) well-established oncogenic virus of
cervical, anogenital, oropharyngeal cancer. various subtypes hpv been
detected 0% 60% breast cancers. roles hpv carcinogenesis
of breast cancer remain controversial. study performed determine 
prevalence hpv-positive breast cancer korean patients evaluate the
possibility carcinogenic effect hpv breast.
methods: meta-analysis performed 22 case-control studies hpv infection
in breast cancer. total 123 breast cancers, nine intraductal papillomas 
13 nipple tissues patients proven cervical hpv infection tested by
real-time polymerase chain reaction detect 28 subtypes hpv. breast cancers 
were composed 106 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (ffpe) breast cancer
samples 17 touch imprint cytology samples breast cancers.
results: overall odds ratio breast cancer hpv infection 5.43 
(95% confidence interval, 3.24 9.12) i<sup>2</sup> = 34.5% in
meta-analysis published studies case-control setting was
statistically significant. hpv detected 22 cases breast cancers (17.9%)
and two cases intaductal papillomas (22.2%). however, cases weak
positivity.
conclusions: results failed serve significant evidence support the
relationship hpv breast cancer. study larger
epidemiologic population merited determine relationship hpv and
breast cancer.
