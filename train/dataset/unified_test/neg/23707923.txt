the rapid influenza diagnostic tests (ridts) widely distributed, simple to
use, often lack sensitivity compared gold standard methods (viral
culture nucleic acid detection technologies). applying ridts outside of
epidemic pandemic infections results large numbers false negatives.
hence, sensitive ridt would reduce number false negatives would
result increased clinical value. evaluated potential proximity 
extension assay (pea) detection influenza h1 viruses. this
technology makes use antibodies capture pathogen, followed molecular
detection. forty-seven nasopharyngeal swab samples, confirmed infections of
the h1 2009 pandemic influenza virus, evaluated. performance pea 
compared ridt quickvue influenza a+b assay. success rate the
comparative assays modeled means binary logistic response model. both
assays performed equally well within current range viral particles,
expressed log10 copies/ml. actual input viral particles taken 
into account, 95% hitrate pea lies within range 4.60-7.02 log10
copies/reaction, almost 2 log10 sensitivity improvement 95% 
hitrate quickvue ridt, ranging 6.86 9.37 log10 copies/reaction.
the pea method holds promise improve sensitive detection influenza viruses 
in clinical samples.
