molecular therapy, including gene therapy, promising strategy the
treatment human disease. however, delivery molecular therapeutics
efficiently specifically target tissue remains significant
challenge. human transferrin (tf)-targeted cationic liposome-dna complex,
tf-lipoplex, shown high gene transfer efficiency efficacy human head
and neck cancer vitro vivo (xu, l., pirollo, k.f., tang, w.h., rait,
a., chang, e.h. hum. gene ther. 1999;10:2941-2952). explore the
structure, size, formation process, structure-function relationships of
tf-lipoplex. observed tf-lipoplex highly compact structure,
with relatively uniform size 50-90 nm. nanostructure novel that
it resembles virus particle dense core enveloped membrane coated
with tf molecules spiking surface. importantly, compared unliganded
lipoplex, tf-lipoplex shows enhanced stability, improved vivo gene transfer
efficiency, long-term efficacy systemic p53 gene therapy human
prostate cancer used combination conventional radiotherapy. the
basis observations, propose multistep self-assembly process and
tf-facilitated dna cocondensation model may provide explanation the
resultant small size effectiveness nanostructural tf-lipoplex system.
