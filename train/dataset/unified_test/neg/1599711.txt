the expression chimeric gene delta kpf promoter region of
delta-crystallin gene replaced long terminal repeats (ltr) friend
spleen focus forming virus (sffv) studied transgenic mice approaching 
the regulatory mechanism expression chicken delta-crystallin gene. 
recombinant plasmid (p delta kpf) dna containing delta kpf gene microinjected
into male pronuclei fertilized mouse eggs. injected eggs implanted
into oviducts pseudopregnant female mice allowed develop term.
subsequently, 35 mice eggs born. mice analyzed 2
weeks age respect gene integration expression method dna
blot hybridization immunoenzymologic assay. dna-dna hybridization indicated
that genomic dna one mice retained sequences hybridized 
strongly probe, p delta kpf. enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)
showed delta kpf gene expressed lens, brain,
muscle liver. results demonstrate essential regulatory
elements tissue-specific expression chicken delta-crystallin gene reside
in sequences downstream +677bp.
