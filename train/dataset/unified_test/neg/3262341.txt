recently, several pyrimidine purine 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides shown 
to inhibit replication human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv), the
causative agent acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). these
compounds usually prepared reduction corresponding
2'-deoxynucleosides. present experiments demonstrate that
2',3'-dideoxynucleosides also made enzymatic trans-glycosylation, using
the trans-n-deoxyribosylase lactobacillus helveticus. broad specificity 
of enzyme makes possible synthesize metabolic studies
radiochemically pure 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, using diverse purine and
pyrimidine base acceptors.
