captive great egret (ardea albus) nestlings maintained controls were
dosed methylmercury chloride low (0.5), high doses (5 mg/kg, wet
weight) fish. low dosed birds given methylmercury concentrations
comparable current exposure wild birds everglades (florida, usa).
when compared controls, low dosed birds lower packed cell volumes, dingy
feathers, increased lymphocytic cuffing skin test, increased bone marrow
cellularity, decreased bursal wall thickness, decreased thymic lobule size, fewer
lymphoid aggregates lung, increased perivascular edema lung, decreased 
phagocytized carbon lung. high dosed birds became severely ataxic had
severe hematologic, neurologic, histologic changes. severe lesions
were immune nervous system tissues. comparing responses captive 
wild birds, found sublethal effects mercury detected lower
levels captive wild birds, probably due reduced sources of
variation characteristic highly controlled laboratory study. conversely,
thresholds severe changes (death, disease) occurred lower
concentrations wild birds captive birds, probably wild birds
were exposed multiple stressors. thus caution used applying
lowest observed effect levels captive wild studies.
