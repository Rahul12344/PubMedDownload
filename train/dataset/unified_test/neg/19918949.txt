certain regions china high rates esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(escc). previous studies human papillomavirus (hpv), proposed causal factor,
have produced highly variable results. attempted evaluate hpv escc more
definitively using extreme care prevent dna contamination. collected tissue
and serum china 272 histopathologically-confirmed escc cases with
rigorous attention good molecular biology technique. tested hpv dna 
fresh-frozen tumor tissue using pcr pgmy l1 consensus primers hpv16 
18 type-specific e6 e7 primers, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue using spf(10) l1 primers. hpv-positive cases, evaluated p16(ink4a)
overexpression hpv e6/e7 seropositivity evidence carcinogenic hpv
activity. beta-globin, thus dna, adequate 98.2% frozen tumor
tissues (267/272). these, 99.6% (95% confidence interval (ci) = 97.9-100.0%)
were negative hpv dna pgmy, 100% (95% ci = 98.6-100%) negative by
hpv16/18 e6/e7 pcr. corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor
specimens, 99.3% (95% ci = 97.3-99.9%) hpv negative spf(10). pgmy, 1
case tested weakly positive hpv89, noncancer causing hpv type. spf(10), 
2 cases tested weakly positive: 1 hpv16 1 hpv31. hpv dna-positive 
case evidence hpv oncogene activity measured p16(ink4a)
overexpression e6/e7 seropositivity. study provides definitive
evidence date hpv involved escc carcinogenesis china. hpv
dna contamination cannot ruled explanation high hpv prevalence
in escc tissue studies less stringent tissue procurement processing
protocols.
