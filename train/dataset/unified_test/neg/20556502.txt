between 2008 2010, 19 strains infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) were
isolated vaccinated chicken flocks sichuan province, china. s1
genes isolates amplified sequenced. phylogenetic analysis
revealed 19 isolates 37 reference ibv strains grouped into
eight genotypes. although ibvs taiwan-i type, massachusetts type, and
proventriculitis type isolated, isolates lx4 genotype.
homology analysis sequences s1 genes 19 isolates 37
reference ibv strains revealed identity nucleotides amino
acid sequences s1 genes 15 lx4-type isolates ibv
strains 71.9-99.3% 72.1-99.1%, respectively, analyzed
ibv lx4 type 96.0-99.9% 94.3-99.8%, respectively. results from
this study published results genbank database showed that
isolates circulating sichuan province recent years mainly lx4
genotype, predominant genotype circulated china recent years.
