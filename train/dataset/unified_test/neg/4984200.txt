in studies factors conditions influencing yellow fever (yf) virus 
plaque neutralization test, 60 min found minimal time necessary for
equilibration virus-antibody complex 23 37 c. maximal virus titers 
in diluent controls pre- postinoculation serum-containing
mixtures occurred 60-min adsorption time. serum neutralization indices
also seemed level time. heating (56 c 30 min) decreased the
neutralizing capacity serum. however, slope neutralization curve
was affected. addition native (unheated) "serum factor" form of
fresh guinea pig monkey sera partially restored neutralizing activity lost
by heating some, all, sera. many sera contained nonspecific inhibitors
of yf virus infectivity neutralization. preliminary studies ether
extraction suggest inhibitors lipid nature.
