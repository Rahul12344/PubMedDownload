background: report interlaboratory comparison methods the
determination hepatitis c virus (hcv) serum load genotype a
recently, established molecular laboratory alaska native medical center
(anmc) two independent laboratories using different assays. anmc, a
real-time quantitative rt-pcr amplification methodology (qpcr) developed
in hcv viral loads determined interpolation qpcr results those
of standards calibrated world health organization (who) first
international standard hcv. hcv genotype subsequently determined direct
sequencing dna fragment generated qpcr assay.
objectives study design: methods statistically compared to
results obtained patient sera two independent laboratories using 
different commercially available viral load assays; quantiplex hcv rna (bayer
diagnostics) amplicor hcv monitor (v 2.0) (roche molecular systems), well 
as two different genotyping assays; restriction fragment length polymorphism
(rflp) inno-lipa hcv ii (innogenetics).
results: anmc's real-time qpcr hcv viral load results compared moderately well
with obtained quantiplex hcv rna method (r2=0.3813), compared
quite well recent lot numbers amplicor hcv monitor viral loads
are derived iu/ml (r2=0.6408), compared poorly earlier lot numbers of
amplicor hcv monitor viral loads derived copies/ml (r2=0.0913). 
the anmc direct sequencing method genotype determination compared moderately 
to well rflp (84-86%) inno-lipa (85-97.5%) methods.
conclusions: viral load comparisons highlight discrepancies may
occur patient hcv viral loads monitored using different types assays.
comparison hcv genotype different methods reliable statistically
and important clinically predicting probability response antiviral
therapy. however, viral loads important monitoring response therapy 
has begun.
