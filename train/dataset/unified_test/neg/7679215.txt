herpesvirus dna polymerases prototypes alpha-like dna polymerases and
important targets antiherpesvirus drugs. investigated changes 
catalytic subunit herpes simplex virus dna polymerase following dna binding by
using techniques endogeneous fluorescence quenching limited
proteolysis. fluorescence studies revealed reduction rate of
quenching acrylamide presence dna without changes wavelength 
of emission peak lifetime fluorophore, consistent the
possibility conformational changes. strikingly, proteolysis studies
revealed binding variety natural synthetic dna rna molecules
induced appearance new cleavage site trypsin near residue 1060 of
the protein increased cleavage trypsin near center protein. the
extent cleavages correlated affinity polymerase for
these ligands. data provide strong evidence binding nucleic acid
polymers induces substantial localized conformational changes polymerase. 
the locations enhanced tryptic cleavage near sites implicated substrate
recognition interaction processivity factor suggest the
conformational changes important catalysis processivity this
prototype alpha-like dna polymerase. inhibition changes may provide a
mechanism antiherpesvirus drugs.
