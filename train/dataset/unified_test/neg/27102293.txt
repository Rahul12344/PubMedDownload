the kras/ k-ras oncogene crucially involved human cancer. term
"oncogene" -- i.e., gene able transform normal cell tumor cell -
was introduced 1969, word used human carcinogenesis
literature much later. transforming kras hras oncogenes the
kirsten harvey sarcoma viruses identified early 1980s due 
to complicated structures viral genomes. orthologs viral
oncogenes found transforming dna fragments human cancers the
form mutated versions hras kras proto-oncogenes. thus, ras genes
were first human oncogenes identified. subsequent studies showed that
mutated kras acted vivo oncogenic driver, indicated studies of
anti-egfr therapy metastatic colorectal cancers. review addresses the
historical background experimental studies led discovery of
kirsten ras oncogene, role mutated kras human carcinogenesis, and
recent therapeutic studies cancer cells kras mutations.
