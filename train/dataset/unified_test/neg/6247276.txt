pathology chickens infected avian nephoblastoma virus mav-2(n).

watts sl, smith re.

a neophroblastoma-inducing myeloblastosis-associated virus, mav-2(n), derived
from avian myeloblastosis virus characterized respect biochemical
composition avian pathogenesis. purified fibroblast-grown virus contained the
same size 35s ribonucleic acid relative amounts viral
polypeptides another myeloblastosis-associated virus inducing predominantly
osteopetrosis mav-2(o). plaque-purified mav-2(n) induced 76 93% incidence of
nephroblastoma 3 50% incidence osteopetrosis spafas line 15 x 
7 chickens: oncogenic spectrum onset nephroblastoma varied with
the line chicken route injection. renal neoplasms manifest 
chickens older 2 months grew massive size. furthermore, 29% of
control chickens housed mav-2(n)-infected chickens demonstrated
nephroblastoma. mav-2(n)-infected chickens growth rates blood packed cell
volumes comparable uninfected chickens. infected chickens 2 months of
age increased kidney, liver, spleen weights; tumor-bearing chickens 3 
4 months age increased liver, lung, brain, pancreas, bone weights. the
concentration albumin decreased concentration gamma globulin
was increased serum mav-2(n)-infected chickens. analysis sera of
nephroblastoma-bearing chickens virus antibody showed three states
existed: (i) high levels neutralizing antibody, (ii) high levels virus, and
(iii) simultaneous presence low levels. pathological and
virological features mav-2(n) distinguish mav-2(o) are
discussed.
