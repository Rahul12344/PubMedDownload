closely related natural plum pox virus (ppv) isolates derived homologous rna
recombination ppv-d ppv-m recently identified shown
naturally spread several european countries. serological properties
were identical conventional ppv-m isolates, could detected 
only combined analysis least two different genome parts. simplify the
detection recombinants primers specific ppv-m ppv-d sequences with
binding sites located sides recombination crossover situated in
the c-terminal part nib designed. used direct
differentiation ppv-m, ppv-d recombinants reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). method convenient for
identification recombinant ppv single well mixed infection with
ppv-m ppv-d.
