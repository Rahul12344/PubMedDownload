rotavirus nonstructural protein nsp4 recently suggested function a
viral enterotoxin play role pathophysiological mechanism whereby
rotaviruses induce diarrhea. ability rotavirus nsp4 stimulate humoral
immune response examined naturally infected children adults, rotavirus
vaccinated children, well cellular immune response adults. this
study, 10 10 naturally infected children 9 10 rotavirus-vaccinated
children showed weak humoral igg immune response recombinant nsp4 (rnsp4)
and/or synthetic peptide corresponding residues 114-134 nsp4. modest
serum igg antibody responses detected 20 20 adults. cellular immune 
response rnsp4 and/or nsp4(114-134) detected 8 10 adults measured
either t-cell proliferative response (7 10), increased production of
il-2 (6 10), increased production interferon-gamma (8 10). these
results indicate nsp4 induces humoral immune response humans show
for first time nsp4 stimulates cellular immune response, possibly
including cytolytic t-cells.
