cytotoxic lymphocyte recognition transfected cells expressing cloned
retroviral gene.

the lysis murine sarcoma virus-murine leukaemia virus (msv-mulv)-induced
tumour cells cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl) appears require antigen 
specified msv-mulv, induced infection, presented association
with class major histocompatibility complex antigens. viral proteins the
tumorigenic mulv seem part antigens recognized dually
restricted anti-mulv ctl, precise nature putative viral antigen(s)
recognized ctl unknown. studies using recombinant viruses suggested
that product viral envelope gene (env gene), perhaps glycoprotein
gp70, viral antigen recognized ctl. attempts use purified gp70 or
anti-gp70 antibodies block ctl recognition retrovirus-induced tumour cells,
however, yielded contradictory results. examine closely role 
gp70 ctl response mulv infections, constructed murine cell
lines express env gene moloney murine leukaemia virus
(m-mulv). show balb/c-3t3 cells expressing m-mulv envelope gene 
products cell surface susceptible lysis m-mulv-specific ctl.
