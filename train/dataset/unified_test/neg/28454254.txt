adult sporadic burkitt lymphoma (bl) rare aggressive neoplasm represents
~1-5% lymphomas diagnosed adults. disease exhibits aggressive
clinical manifestation, frequently involves central nervous system
(cns) early stages, usually accompanied abnormalities in
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) examinations and/or neuroradiography. current study
describes rare case 29-year-old man presented oculomotor nerve 
palsy without palpated masses, b symptoms, peripheral blood anomaly and
abnormalities nervous system. patient initially misdiagnosed 
abducens diplopia, subsequently confirmed bl early cns
invasion. epstein-barr virus human immunodeficiency virus infection were
negative. intensive systemic chemotherapy hyperfractionated
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, therarubicin dexamethasone (hyper-cvad,
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 days 2-4; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 days 5 12,
therarubicin 50 mg/m2 day 5 dexamethasone 40 mg days 2-5 12-15),
including intrathecal chemotherapy methotrexate (5 mg), arabinocytidine (5
mg) dexamethasone (5 mg), determined appropriate treatment.
rituximab (375 mg/m2 day 1) administered alongside chemotherapy to
increase treatment efficacy. patient temporarily underwent complete
remission, subsequently relapsed suitable bone marrow donor was
available. adult sporadic bl early cns invasion, traditional tests
such neuroradiography csf examination fail identify, uncommon.
therefore, appropriate diagnostic tests critical accurate diagnosis and
must performed immediately, particularly patients present unusual
image laboratory manifestations.
