this study investigate treatment yinqiaojiedu soft capsule for
influenza virus a/pr8/34 (h1n1) infection. model pneumonia established
by dropping influenza virus nose normal mice, lung index 
death rate observed. real time rt-pcr western blotting technique were
used detect virus load relative expression m1 protein lungs 
of mice 1st, 3rd, 5th 7th day infection. results showed that
yinqiaojiedu soft capsule 1 g x kg(-1) 0.5 g x kg(-1) dose groups can
decrease lung index significantly 3rd, 5th 7th day being
infected (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), number death two groups of
animals decreased significantly. yinqiaojiedu soft capsule 1 g x kg(-1) dose
group decreased virus load time point, lower 0.5 g x kg(-1)
dose group 3rd, 5th 7th day (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). yinqiaojiedu soft
capsule decrease relative expression m1 protein lungs mice, 1 g 
x kg(-1) 0.5 g x kg(-1) dose groups significantly lower expression 
m1 protein compared model group 3rd 7th day (p < 0.05, p < 0.01).
it concluded yinqiaojiedu soft capsule exerts antiviral effects
against influenza virus downregulating expression virus load m1
protein.
