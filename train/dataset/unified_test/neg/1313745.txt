encapsidation presynthesized nascent (synthesized de novo) vesicular
stomatitis virus (vsv) leader rna vitro nucleocapsid protein (n) and
the role phosphoprotein (p, previously known ns) process were
examined. presynthesized vsv leader rnas derived sp6 transcription 
vectors containing (+) (-) leader genes nascent rna was
derived transcription viral ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complex. n and
the p proteins made transcription sp6 vectors containing genes, 
followed translation mrnas rabbit reticulocyte lysate. here, we
demonstrate n protein alone encapsidated presynthesized vsv leader rna; 
however, prior formation n-p complex totally abolished encapsidation
property n. hand, encapsidation nascent rna n protein
was stimulated n-p complex. results suggest encapsidation by
the n protein presynthesized nascent vsv rna separate biochemical
processes distinguished differential role the
phosphoprotein p two reactions.
