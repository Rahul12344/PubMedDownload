most cases hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) japan develop background
of chronic liver disease caused hepatitis c virus (hcv). recently, however,
hcv-associated hcc shown decreasing, non-b non-c hcc
(nbnc-hcc), negative hcv hepatitis b virus infection, has
increased. main cause nbnc-hcc alcoholic liver disease, recent 
increase nbnc-hcc thought due increase patients with
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). approximately 10% nafld cases
involve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), nash progress liver
cirrhosis associated complications hcc. accurate
data percentage nash-related hcc among all-cause hcc japan, 
no large-scale investigation performed. however, rate thought 
be 3% overall hcc, lower united states. the
incidence hcc patients nash-related cirrhosis thought 2% per 
year, lower hcv-related cirrhosis. risks nash-related
hcc include advanced hepatic fibrosis, older age, male. nafld that
includes nash associated metabolic syndrome, includes obesity and
diabetes, metabolic syndrome risk factor hcc. genetic factors and
dietary patterns may also related nash-related hcc. thus, regular hcc
surveillance, performed patients viral chronic liver disease, is
required patients nafld, diagnostic markers required simple,
rapid specific detection nash-related hcc.
