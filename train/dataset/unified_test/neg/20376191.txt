the processes permitted siv strains emerge epidemically hiv
groups remain elusive. paradigmatic theories propose factors may have
facilitated adaptation human host (e.g., unsafe injections), none which
provide coherent explanation timing, geographical origin, scarcity 
of epidemic hiv strains. updated molecular clock analyses established
relatively narrow time intervals (roughly 1880-1940) major siv transfers to
humans. factors could favor hiv emergence time frame may been
genital ulcer disease (gud), resulting high hiv-1 transmissibility (4-43%),
largely exceeding parenteral transmissibility; lack male circumcision
increasing male hiv infection risk; gender-skewed city growth increasing
sexual promiscuity. surveyed colonial medical literature reporting incidences 
of gud relevant regions, concentrating cities, suffering less
reporting biases rural areas. coinciding time origin the
major hiv groups, colonial cities showed intense gud outbreaks incidences
1.5-2.5 orders magnitude higher mid 20(th) century. surveyed
ethnographic literature, concluded male circumcision frequencies were
lower early 20(th) century nowadays, low rates correlating spatially
with emergence hiv groups. developed computer simulations model 
early spread hiv-1 group kinshasa before, estimated 
origin virus, using parameters derived colonial literature. these
confirmed early 20(th) century particularly permissive the

suggest intense gud promiscuous urban communities main factor
driving hiv emergence. low circumcision rates may played role, probably by
their indirect effects gud.
