the paramyxovirus gene end u tracts thought serve templates the
addition 3' polya tail viral mrnas. goal work described here
was determine function transcription naturally occurring
variability length gene end u tracts paramyxovirus simian virus 
5 (sv5). anchored rt-pcr assay developed test hypothesis the
variable u tracts template addition variable lengths polya tails to
mrnas. results showed although sv5 np, m, sh genes encode u
tracts seven, four, six u residues, respectively, mrnas contain
similar polya tails approximately 250-290 bases. results indicate that
the variable gene end u tracts functionally equivalent directing
polyadenylation. reverse genetics system based dicistronic minigenome
containing sh-hn gene junction used test hypothesis the
variable u tracks affect efficiency transcription termination. minigenome 
templates containing sh gene end long u tract six residues (u6)
directed efficient transcription termination reinitiation downstream
hn start site nucleotide preference downstream intergenic region.
surprisingly, truncating sh gene end u tract four residues (u4) not
affect sh termination but, rather, reduced downstream hn reinitiation 20-30%
of wild-type levels. efficient hn reinitiation could restored mutant u4
templates either two ways: increasing u-tract length four to
six residues increasing length intergenic region. efficient hn
reinitiation required minimum six bases last nucleotide sh
and first nucleotide hn. propose paramyxoviruses, the
gene end u tract serves previously unrecognized role spacer region between
the gene end gene start sites.
