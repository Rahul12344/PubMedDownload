objective: develop validate claims signature model estimates
proportions hiv-infected patients administrative claims databases who
switched combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) regimens virologic 
failure.
methods: authors used hiv-specific registry (development data set) to
develop logistic regression models estimate odds virologic failure among
patients switched cart regimens. models validated sample of
administrative claims laboratory values (validation data set). final
model applied application data set worked example.
results: 1691, 1073, 3954 eligible patients cart switches 
the development, validation, application data sets, respectively. the
development data set, virologic failure switch observed 21.8% the
time. failure likely caused regimen switch among patients were
treatment experienced, receiving baseline regimen > 180 days, 
had â‰¥ 2 physician visits within 90 days, > 1 hiv rna cd4 cell
count test within 30 days, resistance test within 180 days, a
change regimen type. final model good discriminatory ability (c =
0.885) fit (hosmer-lemeshow p = 0.8692). failure estimated occur in
18.9% (v. 18.6% observed) switches validation data set 13.8% the
application data set.
conclusions: claims signature model allows payers use claims data to
estimate virologic failure rates patient populations, thereby better
understanding plan costs failure.
