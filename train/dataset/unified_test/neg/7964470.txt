during viral infections, cd8+,cd45ro+ populations expand. primed cells
express abundant levels cytoplasmic granules contain perforin tia-1. 
recent work suggested majority cd8+ population downregulates
bcl-2 protein expression destined undergo apoptosis. study we
have investigated elimination apoptotic cd8+ cells human
monocyte-derived murine bone marrow macrophages. found these
phagocytes recognize ingest apoptotic cd8+ cd4+ cells using an
alpha v beta 3 (vitronectin receptor)/cd36/thrombospondin recognition system,
with receptors used recognition apoptotic neutrophils.
these data provide new evidence mechanism enables clearance of
greatly increased populations cd8+ effector cells found viral
infections. enables cellular homeostasis occur host upon
resolution viral diseases vivo.
