4z,15z-bilirubin-ixα (4z,15z-br), endogenous compound sparingly
soluble water, binds human serum albumin (hsa) high affinity a
flexible manner. phage library displaying recombinant hsa domain ii was
constructed, three rounds panning immobilized 4z,15z-br, and
eight clones high affinity pigment found contain conserved
basic residues, lysine arginine, positions 195 199. wild
type two mutants, k195a k199a, whole hsa well stand-alone domain
ii expressed pichia pastoris ligand-binding studies. binding of
4z,15z-br k195a k199a mutants decreased whole hsa 
domain ii proteins. p-helicity conformer (p-form) 4z,15z-br found to
preferentially bind wild types k195a mutants, whereas m-form
bound k199a mutants. photoconversion experiments showed p-form of
4z,15z-br transformed highly water-soluble isomers much faster rate
than m-form. addition, m-form 4z,15z-br showed higher affinity 
domain domain ii. present findings suggest that, whereas both
lys195 lys199 subdomain iia important high-affinity binding of
4z,15z-br, lys199 plays prominent role elimination 4z,15z-br.
