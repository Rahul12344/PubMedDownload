t cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-containing protein 3 (tim-3) newly
identified negative immunomodulator up-regulated dysfunctional cells
during viral infections. expression function tim-3 human innate
immune responses hcv infection, however, remains poorly characterized. 
this study, report tim-3 constitutively expressed human resting
cd14(+) monocyte/macrophages (m/m(ø)) functions cap block il-12, a
key pro-inflammatory cytokine linking innate adaptive immune responses. tim-3
expression significantly reduced il-12 expression increased upon
stimulation toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) ligand--lipopolysaccharide (lps) and
tlr7/8 ligand--r848. notably, tim-3 over-expressed un-stimulated well as
tlr-stimulated m/m(ø), inversely associated diminished il-12
expression chronically hcv-infected individuals compared healthy
subjects. up-regulation tim-3 inhibition il-12 also observed in
m/m(ø) incubated hcv-expressing hepatocytes, well primary m/m(ø) or
monocytic thp-1 cells incubated hcv core protein, effect mimics 
function complement c1q reversible blocking hcv core/gc1qr
interaction. importantly, blockade tim-3 signaling significantly rescues
hcv-mediated inhibition il-12, primarily expressed tim-3 negative 
m/m(ø). tim-3 blockade reduces hcv core-mediated expression negative
immunoregulators pd-1 socs-1 increases stat-1 phosphorylation.
conversely, blocking pd-1 silencing socs-1 gene expression also decreases
tim-3 expression enhances il-12 secretion stat-1 phosphorylation. these
findings suggest tim-3 plays crucial role negative regulation innate
immune responses, crosstalk pd-1 socs-1 limiting stat-1
phosphorylation, may novel target immunotherapy hcv infection.
