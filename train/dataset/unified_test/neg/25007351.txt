we developed panel synthetic glycans receptor mimics the
specific capture influenza viruses. glycans printed onto commercial
glass slides using free amine end spacer generate small
focused microarray. microarray evaluated ability capture three
different strains influenza virus, two h1n1, a/brisbane/59/2007 and
a/solomon islands/3/2006 one h3n2, a/aichi/2/1968. observed excellent
detection ability compounds exhibiting clinically relevant (10(1)
plaque forming units) limit detection. also tested drug susceptibility 
of current antivirals, zanamivir ostelamivir using microarray could 
determine antiviral resistance strains.
