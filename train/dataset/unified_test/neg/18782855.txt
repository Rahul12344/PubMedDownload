objectives: haemophagocytic syndrome (hps) known relatively rare
complication autoimmune diseases. analysed clinical features of
hps patients systemic autoimmune diseases.
methods: one thousand fourteen patients systemic autoimmune diseases
admitted hokkaido university hospital 1997 2007 recruited [350
sle, 136 ra, 98 polymyositis/dermatomyositis (pm/dm), 88 ssc, 91 vasculitis
syndrome, 37 primary ss, 26 adult onset still's disease (aosd) 188 other
diseases]. clinical features treatment outcomes retrospectively
analysed.
results: thirty cases (3.0%) fulfilled hps criteria (progressive cytopenia two
or lineages haemophagocytosis reticuloendothelial systems).
underlying diseases sle (18), ra (2), pm/dm (2), ssc (2), vasculitis (1), ss
(2) aosd (3). nineteen patients diagnosed having
autoimmune-associated hps, eight infection-associated, one drug-induced one
developed hps haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. treatment
of hps, high-dose corticosteroid monotherapy given 26 cases, being
effective 12 (46%). ten 15 patients corticosteroid-resistant
autoimmune-associated hps treated csa, cyclophosphamide tacrolimus, 
leading remission 80%. overall mortality rate 20%. multivariate
analysis showed presence infections crp level >50 mg/l hps
related poor prognosis.
conclusions: prevalence hps among in-hospital patients systemic
autoimmunity ignorable. administration immunosuppressants effective
in cases autoimmune-associated hps, whereas prognosis poor in
infection-associated hps.
