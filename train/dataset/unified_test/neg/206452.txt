the events fusion 11- 16-day embryonic mouse liver erythroblasts
induced sendai virus (sv) followed scanning electron microscope 
(sem). erythroid precursors incubated virus showed numerous 'pores' on
the cell membrane. cell fusion began appearance fine 'meshwork'
structure adjacent cells, followed gradual formation common
cell membrane terminated appearance polykaryons, the
nuclei easily recognized located vicinity polykaryon
membrane. difference process fusion erythroblasts 
at identical different stages maturation.
