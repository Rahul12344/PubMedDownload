an efficient host response human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection may depend
on rapid sensing infection innate immune response prior to
deployment viral immunosubversive functions. control hcmv dissemination
could ensured apoptosis cells immediately following infection. the
present report, demonstrated changes ratio c-flip flice
contributed early sensitivity hcmv-infected mrc5 fibroblasts tumour
necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), providing innate response infection.
dendritic cells (dcs) co-cultured hcmv-infected mrc5 cells acquired the
ability secrete tnf-alpha amount sufficient kill infected
fibroblasts. blockage tnf-alpha binding receptor mrc5 cells with
soluble tnf-r reduced number dead, hcmv-infected fibroblasts ingested by
dcs, thus highlighting impact apoptotic state infected cells for
efficient loading dcs. dcs loaded antigens available early in
infection, input virion-associated pp65, could engage antigen
processing cross-presentation specific cd8(+) cells. cross-presentation 
was impaired mrc5 cells treated pan-caspase inhibitor zvad
before co-culture dcs. altogether, data suggest innate killing 
capacity dcs early stage infection plays role activation of
anti-hcmv cd8(+) cells.
