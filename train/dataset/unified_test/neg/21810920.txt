the application phage display technology mammalian proteins multiple
transmembrane regions limited success due difficulty generating
these proteins sufficient amounts purity. report method can
be easily generally applied sorting phage display libraries with
multispan protein targets solubilized detergent. key feature this
approach production biotinylated multispan proteins virions a
baculovirus vector allows library panning without prior purification 
target protein. obtained fab fragments naïve synthetic antibody phage
library that, engineered full-length immunoglobulin (ig)g, specifically
bind cells expressing claudin-1, protein four transmembrane regions that
is used entry co-receptor hepatitis c virus (hcv). affinity-matured 
variants one antibodies efficiently inhibited hcv infection. use 
of baculovirus particles source mammalian multispan protein facilitates
the application phage display difficult class proteins.
