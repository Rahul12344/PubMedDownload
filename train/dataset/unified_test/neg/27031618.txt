objective: study aimed examine prognostic value overexpressed
p16ink4a vulvar cancer. although tumor suppressor p16ink4a shown 
to prognostic value wide variety cancers precancerous lesions, 
its role vulvar cancer still unclear.
methods: publications english language association p16ink4a
and clinicopathological features vulvar cancer searched pubmed,
embase, web science, chinese language identified
manually online china national knowledge infrastructure. strict
inclusion exclusion criteria followed. odds ratios (ors) risk ratios 
(rrs) 95% confidence intervals (cis) pooled assess strength of
association. publication bias estimated using funnel plots egger's
regression test.
results: total 17 studies 2309 patients included. p16ink4a
overexpression found correlate significantly lower international 
federation gynecology obstetrics stage (i+ii vs iii+iv; = 0.60, 95%ci: 
0.41-0.86, p = 0.006), negative lymph node metastasis(negative vs positive; = 
0.61, 95%ci: 0.39-0.95, p = 0.029), patient's age <55 (or = 0.54, 95%ci:
0.31-0.96, p = 0.034), human papillomavirus-positive status (or = 0.01, 95%ci:
0.00-0.11, p<0.001), higher overall survival (rr = 0.53, 95%ci = 0.35-0.80, p
= 0.003).
conclusion: p16ink4a might associated higher survival indicates
better prognosis vulvar cancer.
