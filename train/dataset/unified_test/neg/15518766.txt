human polyomavirus type bk may related interstitial nephropathy or
renal-allograft dysfunction. patients nephropathy due infection with
human polyomavirus may identified early using polymerase chain
reaction(pcr). attempted evaluate whether positive response pcr 
test bk virus dna plasma renal transplant recipients affects the
function renal allograft. seventy-seven patients prospectively
analyzed according operative sex, age, sources allograft, serum
creatinine levels pcr test bk virus, postoperative type of
immunosuppressant, presence graft rejection. two groups distinguished
according pcr result bk virus: group 1 (n = 12) positive pcr reaction 
and group 2 (n = 65) negative reaction. mean follow-up 32.6 weeks. the
incidence positive pcr tests bk virus replication renal
transplantation 15.6%. decoy cells urine detected 20.7%. the
incidence bk virus nephropathy 1.3%. mean serum creatinine levels of
group 1 2 time pcr tests 1.34 1.22, respectively. 
rejection rates group 1 2 8% 4.5%, respectively (p > .05). we
consider pcr assay detect bk virus renal recipients blood may be
useful identify patients risk nephropathy. may serve a
noninvasive indicator bk virus replication, although study limited 
the short follow-up small numbers.
