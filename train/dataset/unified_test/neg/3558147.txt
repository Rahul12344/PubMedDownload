data 52 litters farrowed two seasons cross-fostering experiment were
analyzed estimate variances covariances additive direct maternal
genetic effects immune response pseudorabies virus b. bronchiseptica
vaccine. twenty purebred boars 44 sows duroc, landrace yorkshire
breeds used. immune response measured vaccine challenge. a
modified-live pseudorabies (pr) vaccine administered piglets 28 of
age; response measured log2 serum neutralization titers 56 d. an
inactivated b. bronchiseptica bacterin administered 28, 42 112 d.
antibody levels measured relative positive negative controls 28,
56 119 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results 
this study heritability .18 +/- .09 pr titer .15 +/- .07 .52
+/- .15 56- 119-d elisa values, respectively. variability due to
nurse environment (maternal genetic variance common environmental variance)
as percentage phenotypic variance 11.1% pr titers 29.6 8.8% 
for 56- 119-d elisa values, respectively. heritabilities estimated in
this study indicate that, improved immune response vaccines desired,
selection may useful. however, importance maternal environment would
make early selections less accurate selections based immune response
measured later life.
