viruses two modes spread host body, one release infectious
particles infected cells (global infection) infect
directly infected cell adjacent cell (local infection). since the
mode spread affects evolution life history traits, virulence,
it important reveal level global local infection selected.
previous studies evolution global local infection paid little 
attention dependency measures spatial configuration. we
show evolutionarily stable proportion global local infection, 
it depends distribution target cells. using epidemic model a
regular lattice, consider infection dynamics pair approximation and
check evolutionarily stable strategy. also conduct monte-carlo
simulation observe evolutionary dynamics. show higher local
infection selected target cells become clustered. surprisingly, the
selected strategy depends degree clustering also the
abundance target cells per se.
