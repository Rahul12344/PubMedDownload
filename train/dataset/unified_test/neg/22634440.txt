rapid production influenza vaccine antigen important challenge a
new pandemic occurs. production recombinant antigens plants quick,
cost effective scalable new strategy influenza vaccine production. 
this study, characterized recombinant influenza haemagglutinin antigen 
(hac1) derived 2009 pandemic h1n1 (pdmh1n1) virus expressed
in tobacco plants. volunteers vaccinated 2009 pdmh1n1 oil-in-water
adjuvanted vaccine provided serum lymphocyte samples used study 
the immunogenic properties hac1 antigen vitro. 7 post vaccination,
the vaccine fulfilled licensing criteria antibody responses ha
detected haemagglutination inhibition single radial hemolysis. elisa
and elispot analysis showed hac1 recognized specific serum
antibodies antibody secreting cells, respectively. conducted kinetic
analysis found peak serum hac1 specific antibody response day 14
and 21 post vaccination elisa. also detected elevated production il-2
and ifnγ low frequencies cd4(+) cells producing single multiple th1
cytokines stimulating pbmcs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) the
hac1 antigen vitro. indicates antigen interact cells,
although confirming effective adjuvant would required improve t-cell
stimulation plant based vaccines. conclude tobacco derived
recombinant hac1 antigen promising vaccine candidate recognized b-
