type c rna virus proteins: lack binding specificity host cell chromosomal
dna vitro.

miles k, schwartz sa.

through use two different dna-protein reconstitution methods, examined 
the potential role type c rna tumor virus proteins putative regulatory
agents control virus expression. rauscher murine leukemia virus,
purified chronically infected rat cell cultures, iodinated vitro with
[125i], dissociated nondetergent high-ionic-strength urea-containing
buffer. chemically separated [125i]-labeled viral polypetides were
reconstituted purified dna affinity column chromatography gradient
dialysis renaturation. instances, detectable amount radioactivity
specifically bound double-stranded dna origin. observation 
contrast binding behavior identically prepared radiolabeled,
nonhistone chromosomal proteins purified rat cell nuclei. finding may
rule out, eukaryotic cells, well-described prokarytoic regulatory mechanism 
for control integrated viral gene expression.
