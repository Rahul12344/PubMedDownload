purpose: aquaporin (aqp) hexahelical integral membrane protein that
functions constitutive channel water regulated channel cations
in fluid transporting tissues, including many eye. although aqp1 
cloned cdna library prepared cultures retinal pigment epithelial
(rpe) cells isolated human fetal tissue, three separate studies failed 
various immunochemical techniques detect aqp1 protein adult human rat
rpe preparations. purpose study examine specifically the
expression distribution aqp1 adult human rpe situ using
alternative methodologies model systems determine contribution 
aqp1 water movement across cultured rpe cells isolated human cadaveric
and fetal eyes.
methods: aqp1 human rpe situ determined biotinylation proteins
on cell surfaces streptavidin chromatography, followed immunoblot
analyses. aqp1 distribution polarized vitro rpe model determined with
indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. role channel-mediated
transport water across rpe cell monolayers filters assessed osmotic 
challenge assay. expression levels aqp1 controlled adenovirus
expression system monitored immunoblot analyses.
results: aqp1 protein detected human rpe situ cultures human 
adult fetal rpe cells. functional assays, aqp1 facilitated water movement 
across rpe monolayers expression-dependent manner two complementary
model systems.
conclusion: expression aqp1 rpe vivo probably contributes the
efficient transepithelial water transport across rpe, maintains retinal
attachment, prevents subretinal edema.
