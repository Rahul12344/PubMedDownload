poor efficiency gene transfer cancer cells constitutes major
bottleneck current cancer gene therapy. reasoned tumors are
masses rapidly dividing cells, would efficiently transduced 
vector systems allowing transgene propagation. thus designed two replicative
retrovirus-derived vector systems: one inherently replicative vector, one
defective vector propagated helper retrovirus. vitro, systems
achieved efficient transgene propagation. immunocompetent mice,
replicative vectors transduced >85% tumor cells, whereas defective vectors
transduced <1% similar conditions. noteworthy viral propagation 
could efficiently blocked azido-thymidine, vitro vivo. model
of established brain tumors treated suicide genes, replicative retroviral
vectors (rrvs) approximately 1000 times efficient defective
adenoviral vectors. results demonstrate advantage potential rrvs
and strongly support development cancer gene therapy.
