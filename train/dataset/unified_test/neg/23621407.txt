polymer vesicles, commonly referred polymersomes, self-organized
materials result self-assembly amphiphilic copolymers in
solution. recently, increasing interest biomedical applications
of polymersomes due different functions imparted through
encapsulation molecules within core membrane the
introduction bioactive molecules polymersome surface. describe 
the development study poly(ethylene oxide)-polycaprolactone polymersomes
designed interact influenza viruses two different stages the
infection process. first, conjugation sialic acid n-acetylneuraminic
acid (neu5ac) polymersome surface designed inhibit binding of
viral hemagglutinin sialic acids host cells, thus preventing viral entry.
second, incorporation neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir the
polymersome core designed prevent release progeny virus the
host cells, thus inhibiting viral replication. aim maximizing
multivalent effects polymersome surface, polyester dendrons functionalized
with neu5ac synthesized conjugated polymersomes. binding the
resulting dendritic sialopolymersomes limax flavus agglutinin studied 
compared sialodendron monovalent neu5ac derivative using an
enzyme-linked lectin inhibition assay. found sialodendron
exhibited 17-fold enhancement (per sialoside) relative small molecule,
the dendritic sialopolymersomes resulted almost 2000-fold enhancement in
binding affinity. also demonstrated encapsulation zanamivir into
the dendritic sialopolymersomes could performed efficiency as
for naked polymersomes provide drug loading ~35 wt %. drug release rates 
were similar systems sustained release period 4 days.
overall, results suggest promise using multifunctional polymersome
system interaction inhibition influenza viruses.
