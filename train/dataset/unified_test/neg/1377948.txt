several motifs found target neutralizing antibody
response hiv, human immunodeficiency virus. one well characterized 
motifs maps loop within third hypervariable region (v3) exterior 
envelope glycoprotein gp120 amino acid positions 308-331 referred as
the principal neutralizing determinant (pnd). sequence v3 loop raises
the question immunogenicity degree diversity antibody
response pnd. show neutralization-related motif is
highly immunogenic hiv-positive subjects experimentally immunized
primates rodents submitted various anti-hiv immunization regimens. in
probing diversity antibody response pnds corresponding 11 hiv
sequence-divergent isolates serum samples 101 hiv-positive individuals we
found human antibodies exhibit binding affinity nine pnd synthetic 
peptides. antibody binding cases tested inhibitable the
homologous pnd synthetic peptide. additionally demonstrate antibody 
cross-reactivity towards sequence-divergent pnds detectable sera of
mice chimpanzees experimentally immunized single hiv-1 isolate.
finally, noticed hierarchy reactivity among various
pnds wherein synthetic peptide corresponding mn isolate generally 
the prominently recognized antibodies human, non-human primate, and
rodent origins. based findings features sequences analyzed
we suggest that, despite overall sequence variability, pnd encompasses
conserved amino acid positions epitopes targets antibodies
recognizing sequence-divergent isolates. also propose high positive
charge density frequently recognized pnds high antigenicity
value residues critical broad immunoreactivity of
this neutralization-related motif.
