priority. applied time-series regression models data cardio-respiratory 
mortality rates hong kong 2001 2011. used surveillance data on
outpatient consultations influenza-like illness, laboratory detections of
influenza types/subtypes construct proxy measures influenza activity. in
the model allowed regression coefficients influenza drift over
time, adjusted temperature humidity. regression coefficient for
influenza a(h3n2) increased significantly 2005. regression coefficients
for influenza a(h1n1) b relatively stable period. model
suggested increase seriousness a(h3n2) 2005, year the
appearance a/fujian/411/2002(h3n2)-like virus drifted
a/california/7/2004(h3n2)-like virus appeared. ongoing monitoring mortality
and influenza activity could permit identification future changes in
seriousness influenza virus infections.
