identifying drug resistance mutations important clinical use of
antivirals help define drug's mechanism action the
mechanistic basis resistance. resistance mutations often identified
one-at-a-time studying viral evolution within treated patients viral
growth presence drug cell culture. approaches previously
mapped resistance enfuvirtide, clinically approved hiv-1 fusion
inhibitor, enfuvirtide's binding site n-terminal heptad repeat (nhr) of
the envelope (env) transmembrane domain well limited number allosteric
sites. here, sought better delineate genotypic determinants of
resistance throughout env. used deep mutational scanning quantify the
effect single-amino-acid mutations subtype bg505 env on
resistance enfuvirtide. identified previously characterized and
numerous novel resistance mutations nhr. additional resistance mutations
clustered regions env conformational intermediates, suggesting they
may act different fusion steps altering fusion kinetics and/or exposure
of enfuvirtide binding site. complete map resistance sheds light on
the diverse mechanisms enfuvirtide resistance highlights utility of
using deep mutational scanning comprehensively map potential drug resistance
mutations.
