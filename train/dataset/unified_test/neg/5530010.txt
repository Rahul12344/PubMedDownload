basis variable response arboviruses guanidine treatment.

friedman rm.

the effect guanidine replication group arboviruses, sindbis
virus, semliki forest virus (sfv) studied. guanidine rapidly, but
reversibly, inhibited sfv ribonucleic acid (rna) synthesis. synthesis 
species viral rna inhibited, ribonuclease-resistant forms 
least affected. inhibition occurred drug added point
during log phase virus growth. growth sfv also markedly
inhibited, sindbis virus growth unimpaired. infection of
guanidine-treated cells viruses together resulted significant
inhibition yields both. appears that, case sindbis virus, 
viral rna ordinarily produced excess inhibition synthesis 
does reduce virus yields. case sfv, guanidine also markedly
distorts pattern rna synthesis greatly decreasing production the
26s interjacent rna form. may account observed inhibition sfv
growth presence guanidine.
