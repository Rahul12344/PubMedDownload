many retroviruses tropism cells immune system a
propensity induce immunosuppression host. effects of
retroviruses immune cell function thought mediated through
cytokines. friend immunosuppressive virus-2 (fis-2) low oncogenic murine
leukaemia virus (mulv) induces lymphadenopathy immunosuppression nmri
mice. role cell cytokines generation primary antibody
response healthy fis-2-infected mice studied following antibody
response sheep erythrocytes vitro immunization (ivi) technique. in
cultures fis-2-infected mice, antibody response reduced compared
with cultures uninfected mice production th2 cytokines il-4
and il-6 elevated, whereas th1 cytokines il-2, interferon-gamma
(ifn-gamma) tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) reduced. the
suppressed anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody response cultures mice
infected fis-2 seemed caused insufficient production il-2,
since addition recombinant il-2 stimulated antibody response. effect 
was also observed cultures depleted cells, indicating direct effect 
il-2 b cells. switch th2 cell response suppression il-2
production might play central role immune cell dysfunction induced by
fis-2.
