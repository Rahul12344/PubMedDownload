context: burden tuberculosis (tb) disease children, particularly in
hiv-infected children, poorly described lack effective
diagnostic tests emphasis public health programs transmissible tb.
objectives: objectives study describe observed incidence 
of risk factors tb diagnosis among hiv-infected children enrolled a
large network hiv clinics western kenya.
design: retrospective observational study.
setting: usaid-academic model providing access healthcare (ampath)
partnership kenya's largest hiv/aids care system. since 2001, program 
enrolled 70,000 hiv-infected patients 18 clinics throughout western
kenya.
patients: analysis included hiv-infected children aged 0 13 years
attending ampath clinic.
main outcome measure: primary outcome diagnosis tb, defined
either recorded diagnosis initiation anti-tb treatment.
diagnosis tb based modified kenneth jones scoring system is
consistent case definitions.
results: 6535 hiv-infected children aged 0 13 years, eligible for
analysis, 50.1% female. these, 234 (3.6%) diagnosed tb at
enrollment. subsequently 765 new tb diagnoses 4368.0 child-years of
follow-up incidence rate 17.5 diagnoses (16.3-18.8) per 100
child-years. majority occurred first 6 months after
enrollment (ir: 106.8 per 100 cy, 98.4-115.8). multivariable analysis, being
severely immune-suppressed enrollment (adjusted hazard ratio [ahr]: 4.44, 95% 
ci: 3.62-5.44), ever attended school ahr: 2.65, 95% ci: 2.15-3.25), 
an orphan (ahr: 1.57, 95% ci: 1.28-1.92), severely low weight-for-height at
enrollment (ahr: 1.46, 95% ci: 1.32-1.62), attending urban clinic (ahr:
1.39, 95% ci: 1.16-1.67) independent risk factors incident
tb diagnosis. children receiving combination antiretroviral treatment were
dramatically less likely diagnosed incident tb (ahr: 0.15, 95% ci:
0.12-0.20).
conclusions: data suggest high rate tb diagnosis among hiv-infected
children, severe immune suppression, school attendance, orphan status, 
low weight-for-height, attending urban clinic key risk factors. 
use combination antiretroviral treatment reduced probability an
hiv-infected child diagnosed incident tb 85%.
