in order study relation human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
infection malaria women, pregnancy, prospective cohort 
study initiated centre hospitalier de kigali rwanda routine
voluntary confidential hiv screening antenatal clinics. inclusion in
the cohort hiv-positive equivalent number hiv-negative pregnant 
women, 21 28 weeks gestation, sociodemographic characteristics and
medical history current pregnancy collected; screening for
malaria (tick blood smear) anemia cd4 lymphocyte count were
systematically performed. woman enrolled monthly follow-up 6
months delivery. clinic implemented accessible free of
charge every woman study period scheduled visits. malaria
infection systematically screened case fever compatible
symptoms. cohort included 228 hiv-positive 229 hiv-negative women. at
inclusion, malaria prevalence 8.0% hiv-positive women 3.5% in
hiv-negative women (p < 0.04). study period, incidence malaria
was 6.2 per 100 women-months hiv-positive group 3.5 the
hiv-negative group (relative risk [rr] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [ci] =
1.4-2.3). bulk difference occurred postpartum. kaplan-meier
9-month probability remaining free malaria infection 51.8% in
hiv-positive women 65.2% hiv-negative women (p = 0.013). taking
account multivariate model (including hiv infection, primiparity, cd4
lymphocytes, anemia, education level), positive hiv serostatus remained the
only factor significantly associated malaria infection (rr = 1.4, ci =
1.1-1.6; p = 0.016). study prospectively documents association between
malaria maternal hiv infection highlights increased risk malaria
occurrence hiv-infected women. strategies reduce malaria morbidity 
during pregnancy reinforced areas high hiv seroprevalence.
