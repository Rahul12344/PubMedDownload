human metapneumovirus (hmpv) considered important cause acute
respiratory infections. hmpv cause morbidity hematopoietic stem cell
transplant recipients recent research demonstrated an
important virus patients admitted hospital respiratory infections 
suspected pandemic 2009 influenza (h1n1pdm09) virus. purpose of
this study investigate infections caused hmpv two groups patients
admitted hospital: immunocompromized patients potential risk severe 
outcomes immunocompetent patients severe acute respiratory syndrome. a
total 288 samples tested: 165 samples collected patients with
suspected influenza (h1n1) pdm09 infection first pandemic wave in
2009; 123 samples collected patients hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation program 2008-2009. amplification hmpv genes was
performed polymerase chain reaction. followed sequencing and
phylogenetic analysis. hmpv detected 14.2% (41/288) samples: 17%
(28/165) immunocompetent patients suspected h1n1 infection 10.6%
(13/123) among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. hmpv accounted 
12.1% (8/66) immunocompetent adults patients severe respiratory
infections (median age, 55.9 years). two hmpv subtypes identified, a2
(26.9%; 7/26) b2 (73.1%; 19/26) difference observed the
patient groups terms age immunosuppression level. study highlights 
the significance hmpv immunocompetent adult patients severe infections
and investigations recommended understanding impact this
virus.
