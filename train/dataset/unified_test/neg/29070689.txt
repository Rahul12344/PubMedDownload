rubella virus (ruv) causes systemic infection, transplacental fetal
infection causes congenital rubella syndrome. study, showed that
treatment cells sphingomyelinase inhibited ruv infection. assays using
inhibitors serine palmitoyl transferase ceramide transport protein
demonstrated contribution sphingomyelin (sm) ruv infection. compelling 
evidence direct binding ruv lipid membranes neutral ph obtained 
using liposome coflotation assays. absence either sm cholesterol (chol)
abrogated ruv-liposome interaction. sm chol (sm/chol) also critical 
for ruv binding erythrocytes lymphoid cells. removal ca2+ the
assay buffer mutation ruv envelope e1 protein ca2+-binding sites abrogated 
ruv binding liposomes, erythrocytes, lymphoid cells. however, ruv bound to
various nonlymphoid adherent cell lines independently extracellular ca2+ or
sm/chol. even adherent cell lines, e1 protein ca2+-binding
sites cellular sm/chol essential early stage ruv infection,
possibly affecting envelope-membrane fusion acidic compartments. myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog) recently identified cellular
receptor ruv. however, ruv bound mog-negative cells ca2+-independent 
manner. collectively, data demonstrate ruv two distinct binding
mechanisms: one ca2+ dependent ca2+ independent.
ca2+-dependent binding observed lymphoid cells occurs direct

effective rubella vaccines available, rubella outbreaks still occur many
countries. studied entry mechanism rubella virus (ruv) found that
ruv binds directly host plasma membrane presence ca2+ neutral

sphingomyelin cholesterol critical ruv infection. importantly, ruv
also binds many cell lines ca2+-independent manner. unidentified ruv
receptor(s) involved ca2+-independent binding. believe the
data presented may aid development first anti-ruv drug.
