viral diseases leading cause worldwide yield losses crop production. 
breeding resistance genes (r gene) elite crop cultivars the
standard cost-effective practice. however, r gene-mediated resistance is
limited available r genes within genetic resources many cases, by
strain specificity. therefore, important generate new broad-spectrum
antiviral strategies. crispr-cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced
palindromic repeat, crispr-associated) editing system employed confer
resistance human viruses several plant single-stranded dna geminiviruses, 
pointing possible application crispr-cas9 system virus
control. here, demonstrate strong viral resistance cauliflower mosaic 
virus (camv), pararetrovirus double-stranded dna genome, achieved
through cas9-mediated multiplex targeting viral coat protein sequence. 
further show small interfering rnas (sirna) produced mostly map to
the 3' end single-guide rnas (sgrna), although low levels sirnas map
to spacer region well. however, sirnas responsible the
inhibited camv infection resistance cas9 present.
we also observed edited viruses systematically infected leaves some
transgenic plants, short deletions insertions consistent with
cas9-induced dna breaks sgrna target sites coat protein coding
sequence. edited coat proteins, cases, led earlier translation
stop thus, nonfunctional coat proteins. also recovered wild-type cp
sequence infected transgenic plants, suggesting edited viral
genomes packaged wild-type coat proteins. data demonstrate the
crispr-cas9 system used virus control plant pararetroviruses
with modifications.
