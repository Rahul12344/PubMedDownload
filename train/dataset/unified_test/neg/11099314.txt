dendritic cells (dc) shown efficiently present antigen cd8(+)
cytolytic cells (ctl) pulsed apoptotic cells source of
cell-derived antigen. cross-priming could detected use of
necrotic cells, conflicting results reported cell-derived
soluble lysates. study, reinvestigated issue using autologous 
epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcl) source of
antigen pulse monocyte-derived dc. autologous hla-mismatched
allogeneic lcl used either form apoptotic necrotic
cells soluble cell lysates. day 7, dc co-cultured the
autologous cd8(+) lymphocyte fraction additional 9 days, presence
of exogenous il-2 (added 48 h). end culture period, cd8(+)
ctl efficiently lysed autologous lcl co-cultured dc 
pulsed necrotic apoptotic cells. efficient cross-priming of
autologous cd8(+) cells could induced dc pulsed apoptotic necrotic 
lcl cell lysates demonstrated assays ifn-gamma
production response short-term re-stimulation cd8(+) cells lcl. 
addition, lcl-specific cd8(+) cells could specifically lyse autologous dc that
had pulsed lcl-derived antigens, suggesting dc presented
exogenous antigens hla class molecules.
