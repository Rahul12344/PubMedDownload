the host ranges bacteriophages group a, types 1, 6, 12, 25 group c
streptococci determined. findings indicate susceptibility 
to phages primarily group-specific phenomenon, although modified
by several factors hyaluronic acid capsule, lysogeny, possibly
the presence surface proteins. phage antibody studies indicate 
group phages antigenically related, distinct group c
phage. agreement observation group phages not
specific homologous streptococcal types. purified group c
carbohydrate inactivates group c phage group phages, thus
suggesting carbohydrate, component cell wall, may serve 
phage receptor site. possible inactivate group phages
with group carbohydrate. phage lysis groups c streptococci is
accompanied fragmentation cell wall since c carbohydrate been
identified serologically chemically supernate centrifuged lysates. 
the immediate lysis groups c hemolytic streptococci isolated
cell walls accesory heat-labile lytic factor fresh group c lysates is
also described.
