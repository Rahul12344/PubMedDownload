gene modification tumor cells commonly utilized various strategies of
immunotherapy preventive treatment means modify tumor growth.
gene transfer prior surgery neoadjuvant therapy studied
systematically. addressed, whether direct intra-tumoral injection a
recombinant adenovirus expressing immunomodulatory molecule, heat shock
protein 72 (adhsp72), administered prior surgery could result sustainable
anti-tumor immune responses capable affecting tumor progression survival
in number different murine rat tumor models. using intra-dermal murine
models melanoma (b16), colorectal carcinoma (ct26), prostate cancer (trampc2) 
and rat model glioblastoma (9l), tumors treated vehicle gfp
expressing adenovirus (adgfp) adhsp72. tumors surgically excised 72
h. approximately 25-50% animals adhsp72 treatment group in
control groups showed sustained resistance subsequent tumor challenge. tumor
resistance associated development anti-tumor cellular immune
responses. efficacy adhsp72 neoadjuvant therapy dependent size
of initial tumor greater likelihood immune response generation and
tumor resistance associated smaller tumor size initial treatment. adhsp72
neoadjuvant therapy resulted prolonged survival animals upon re-challenge
with autologous tumor cells compared adgfp vehicle control groups. study
the effects tumor progression distant metastases, single tumor focus of
animals multifocal intra-dermal tumors treated. adhsp72 diminished
progression secondary tumor focus prolonged survival, when
the secondary tumor focus <50 mm3 . results indicate gene
modification tumors prior surgical intervention may beneficial to
prevent recurrence specific circumstances.
