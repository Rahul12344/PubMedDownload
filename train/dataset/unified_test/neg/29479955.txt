background/aim: study aimed investigate potential regulatory role 
prokineticin 2 (pk2) modulation number function kupffer cells
(kcs) progression liver fibrosis patients hepatitis b virus
(hbv). materials methods: obtained liver tissue sections 200 patients
with hbv undergoing surgical resection hospital january 2013 and
july 2016. 200 tissue sections, 150 fibrosis tissues 50 were
hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. immunohistochemical evaluations performed 
to assess expression levels cd68 pk2 sections. clinical
parameters 200 patients also analyzed. results: potential
cytokine, pk2 commonly expressed kcs. addition, close correlation
between pk2 number kcs progression liver fibrosis in
patients hbv found study. conclusion: pk2 expressed kcs
and participates progression liver fibrosis hbv infection. a
potential cytokine, pk2 modulates number kcs fibrosis. thus, pk2
most likely adjusts number m1 cells modulate role kcs the
progression liver fibrosis hbv infection.
