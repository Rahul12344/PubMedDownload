with improved life expectancy, medical records hiv-infected patients are
likely transferred repeatedly hiv caregivers. challenges, and
risk introducing medical error incomplete record transfers poorly
understood. measured number requests record transfer, workload
incurred, explore, using genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing results 
(gart), potential risk incomplete records. using retrospective database
and chart review, examined patients followed southern alberta
clinic 1 january 2004 1 january 2015, determined many
patients transferred care program, associated requests and
the workload record transfer. using complete record gart tests, 
potential importance absent historic records current treatment decisions
was analyzed. annual churn rate 22 ± 3.4%. received requests 
70% patient records left care. median time receipt incoming
medical records 28 days; average clerical time processing data 2
hours/record. gart results, 25% exhibited resistance. 111 patients with
potentially misleading gart results (i.e., documented historical resistance not
visible recent gart), 34 (30.6%) moved elsewhere. rigorous
maintenance continuity hiv record universally practiced.
resources, costs logistic challenges well lack appreciation of
risks clearly shown gart testing, may relevant barriers. addressing such
issues pressing aging transfers care increasingly common.
