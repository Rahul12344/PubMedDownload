purpose: onyx-015 genetically modified adenovirus deletion e1b
early gene therefore designed replicate preferentially p53-mutated
cells. phase ii trial intralesional onyx-015 conducted patients 
hepatobiliary tumors determine safety efficacy treatment.
experimental design: patients biopsy-proven, measurable tumors the
liver, gall bladder, bile ducts beyond scope surgical
resection. patients received intralesional injections onyx-015 either 6 x
10(9) 1 x 10(10) plaque-forming units/lesion total dose 3 x 10(10) 
plaque-forming units, i.p. injections allowed patients malignant
ascites. status p53 assessed immunohistochemistry affymetrix
genechip microarray analysis. studies conducted viral shedding for
the presence antiadenoviral antibodies injection of
onyx-015. patients assessed response toxicity.
results: twenty patients enrolled, 19 patients eligible. half of
the patients primary bile duct carcinomas. serious toxicities (> grade 2)
were uncommon included hepatic toxicity (three patients), anemia (one
patient), infection (one patient), cardiac toxicity (one patient, atrial
fibrillation). sixteen patients evaluable response. among these
evaluable patients, 1 16 (6.3%) partial response, 1 16 (6.3%) had
prolonged disease stabilization (49 weeks), 8 16 (50%) >50%
reduction tumor markers. 19 eligible patients, 18 (94.7%) specimens
available p53 analysis. fifteen 18 patients (83.3%) evidence 
p53 mutation one methods, although methods correlated poorly.
viral shedding confined bile (two two patients) ascites (four of
four patients). pretreatment adenoviral antibodies present 14 14
patients increased 33.2% onyx-015 treatment.
conclusions: intralesional treatment onyx-015 patients hepatobiliary
tumors safe well tolerated, patients evidence an
anticancer effect. high incidence p53 mutations tumors makes this
a logical population test therapy precludes definitive
evaluation necessity p53 mutation onyx-015 clinical activity.
