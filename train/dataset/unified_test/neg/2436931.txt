a monoclonal antibody, gb3, raised human amnion. does
gb3 bind amniotic basement membrane, also recognizes antigenic
structure expressed epidermal well human basement
membranes. antigen synthesized (and excreted) cultured normal human
epidermal keratinocytes. expressed lesser extent a431
epidermoid carcinoma cell line, expressed sv40
virus-transformed svk14 keratinocyte cell line. ultrastructural studies, 
antigen located epidermal basement membrane, lamina densa 
and lamina lucida, associated hemidesmosomes. identified 
protein vitro proteolytic cleavage studies. radio-immunoprecipitates
from cultured human keratinocytes, analysed sds-page, showed gb3
recognized five polypeptides 93.5, 125, 130, 146 150 kd reducing
conditions. probably linked disulfide bonds. tissue distribution
of antigen molecular weights (mws) constitutive polypeptides
suggest different known components basement membranes.
it may provide biochemical marker hemidesmosomes. furthermore, gb3
represents interesting original clinical probe, since antigenic
structure recognized gb3 lacking junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a
lethal genodermatosis dermo-epidermal splitting occurs level of
lamina lucida.
