3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (flt), candidate anti-aids compound clinical
trials, showed anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) potency (50%
effective concentration, 0.0052 microm) slightly better equal 
3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) mt4 cells threefold potent h9
cells. flt resistance demonstrable azt-resistant hiv-1
strains. flt azt showed low cytotoxicity mt4 cells, selectivity
indices (efficacy/toxicity ratio) greater 47,000 greater 33,000,
respectively. cellular permeation flt thymidine (dthd) greater than
that azt, flt dthd permeated cell membranes carrier-mediated 
mechanism well simple diffusion, indicated existence of
nitrobenzylthioinosine-5'-monophosphate-sensitive -insensitive components. by
contrast, transport azt cells simple diffusion. intracellular 
level triphosphate flt (flttp) mt4 cells two- threefold
higher azt (azttp) exposure 1.8 microm compound 12
h. elimination kinetics flttp azttp hiv-1-infected mt4 cells in
fresh medium showed biphasic patterns, initial half-lives 1.03 1.09
h, respectively. phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood
lymphocytes, flttp level increased 59-fold compared in
unstimulated cells 12 h, four- sixfold higher level azttp
in stimulated cells 12 h, remained four- fivefold higher 4-h
elimination period fresh medium twofold higher end 12-h
elimination period. two- eightfold [3h]azt [3h]flt incorporated 
into host cell dna, [3h]azt [3h]flt remained persistently
incorporated 24 h. incorporated [3h]azt [3h]flt alkali
labile, whereas incorporated [3h]dthd alkali stable. pharmacokinetics flt 
in plasma monkeys intravenous (i.v.) administration showed flt 
concentration plasma declined, half-life 1.19 +/- 0.1 h; the
steady-state volume distribution 0.93 +/- 0.2 liter/kg body weight, and
total clearance 0.56 +/- 0.15 liter/kg. oral bioavailability flt was
excellent comparable i.v. bioavailability terms areas the
concentration-time curves three monkeys. total dose, 41 61% was
excreted urine unchanged flt, 3.2 7.4% total dose was
identified glucuronide-conjugated flt urine 48 h i.v. administration 
to monkeys. conclude flt exhibits anti-hiv-1 potency similar that
of azt slightly better selectivity effects higher
intracellular active metabolite levels.
