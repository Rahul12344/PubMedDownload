adenovirus-mediated gene therapy promising new approach treatment of
ovarian cancer. animal models, complete elimination cancer cells often
achieved, although therapeutic gene delivered these
cells. referred bystander effect, tumor cells near 
that receive therapeutic gene also eliminated. several mechanisms have
been proposed bystander effect, including intercellular communication
within tumor via gap junctions, apoptosis, antiangiogenesis, cytokines or
other soluble mediators, immunological mechanisms. two
well-documented antitumor effector cell populations athymic nude mice:
macrophages natural killer (nk) cells. hypothesize peritoneal
populations nk cells nude mice treated adenoviruses involved in
the observed bystander effect vivo model. investigated role 
nk cells immunological mediators bystander effect using p53 tumor 
suppressor therapeutic anticancer gene. ovarian cancer cell lines
tested sensitive lysis nk cells, although different ovarian cancer
cell lines exhibited different sensitivities nk cell-mediated lysis. to
determine importance nk cells overall efficacy bystander
effect gene therapy, nk cells depleted mice administration of
anti-nk1.1 monoclonal antibodies. study efficacy nk depletion, c57bl/6 
(nu/nu) mice given injections i.v. single tail vein injection i.p.
with increasing doses anti-nk1.1 igg. doses anti-nk1.1 antibody, from
100-500 micrograms, essentially eliminated cytotoxic nk activity. assess the
duration depletion single dose anti-nk1.1 igg, time-course
experiment performed. nk 1.1 antibody effective completely depleting
cytotoxic nk cell activity mice 7 days, whether given 500
micrograms (i.p.) 200 micrograms (i.v.). flow cytometric analysis performed on
peritoneal cell populations confirmed depletion nk cells approximately 80%.
finally, survival study performed, animals depleted nk
cells. experiment, nk cell-depleted mice injected anti-nk1.1
igg, control mice mice treated normal saline. two days later, 
all mice inoculated lethal i.p. dose nih:ovcar-3 ovarian cancer
cells. 3 days, mice divided two treatment groups; one
treatment group received three consecutive daily i.p. injections ad-cmv-p53
(sch58500), second treatment group received three consecutive daily i.p. 
injections control adenovirus construct, rad-null. nk cell-depleted
animals, whether treated rad-null ad-cmv-p53 (sch58500) dead of
disease 116 138 days, respectively, initiation adenovirus
treatment, statistically significant difference survival observed
(p = 0.349). significant survival advantage seen control (nk-competent) 
mice treated rad-null (p = 0.04), although dead disease day
184. importantly, control nk-competent mice treated ad-cmv-p53 (sch58500)
showed tumor growth ascites production, animals survived. these
results indicate immunological mechanisms involving natural killer cells
play important role bystander effect involving adenovirus-p53 gene
therapy ovarian cancer.
