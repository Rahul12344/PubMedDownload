because morphologic changes natural rabies usually relatively mild, 
thought severe clinical disease fatal outcome must due to
neuronal dysfunction rabies virus-infected neurons. precise bases 
functional impairment unknown, current knowledge electro-physiological
alterations, effects ion channels neurotransmission, neurotoxicity are
reviewed. rabies virus may induce neuronal death, possibly apoptotic
mechanisms. neuronal apoptosis observed vitro also vivo 
particular experimental conditions. relevance neuronal apoptosis 
situations natural rabies yet fully elucidated.
