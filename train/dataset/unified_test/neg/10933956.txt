the internal ribosome entry site (ires) widely used coexpress
heterologous gene products message single promoter. however, little
is known efficiency ires-dependent second gene expression in
comparison first gene expression. study undertaken to
characterize relative expression ires-dependent second gene a
bicistronic vector, derived 5' untranslated regions the
encephalomyocarditis virus (emcv). ires-dependent second gene expression was
compared cap-dependent first gene expression several cultured cell lines 
and mouse liver vivo. expression ires-dependent second gene
ranged 6 100% (in cases 20 50%) first gene. 
second gene expression plasmid without ires 0.1-0.8% (with some
exceptions) first gene. findings important implications
for use ires, i.e., care taken regarding decreased capacity 
of ires-dependent downstream gene expression well determining gene
should positioned first second gene bicistronic vector.
