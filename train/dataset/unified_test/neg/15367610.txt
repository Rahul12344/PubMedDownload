vertebrates mount strong innate immune response viruses, largely by
activating interferon system. double-stranded rna (dsrna), common
intermediate formed life cycle many viruses, potent trigger of
this response. contrast, general inducible antiviral defense mechanism 
been reported invertebrate. show dsrna induces antiviral
protection marine crustacean litopenaeus vannamei. treated with
dsrna, shrimp showed increased resistance infection two unrelated viruses, 
white spot syndrome virus taura syndrome virus. induction antiviral
state independent sequence dsrna used therefore distinct
from sequence-specific dsrna-mediated genetic interference phenomenon. this
demonstrates first time invertebrate immune system, like its
vertebrate counterparts, recognize dsrna virus-associated molecular
pattern, resulting activation innate antiviral response.
