systemic necrosis one severe symptoms caused plant rna viruses.
recently, systemic necrosis suggested similar features a
defense response referred hypersensitive response (hr), form of
programmed cell death. virus-infected plant cells, host intracellular membrane
structures changed dramatically efficient viral replication.
however, little known whether replication-associated membrane
modification cause symptoms. study, identified an
amino-terminal amphipathic helix helicase encoded radish mosaic virus
(ramv) (genus comovirus) elicitor cell death ramv-infected plants.
cell death caused amphipathic helix features similar hr, as
sgt1-dependence. mutational analyses inhibitor assays using cerulenin
demonstrated amphipathic helix-induced cell death tightly correlated
with dramatic alterations endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane structures.
furthermore, cell death-inducing activity amphipathic helix was
conserved cowpea mosaic virus (genus comovirus) tobacco ringspot virus
(genus nepovirus), classified family secoviridae.
together, results indicate er membrane modification associated with
viral intracellular replication may recognized prime defense responses
against plant viruses.
