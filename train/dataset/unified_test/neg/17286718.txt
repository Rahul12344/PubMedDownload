there evidence average total charges per episode child birth depend on
maternal plus child length stay, neonatal intensive care unit (nicu)
utilization, maternal race mode delivery. particular, maternal and
child records linked, study suggests adjusted maternal
characteristics, cost vaginal deliveries followed nicu utilization may 
be higher cost cesarean sections nicu utilization.objective:
cesarean section, one frequently performed surgical procedures on
women, rising globally usa. much current cesarean section
literature focuses reporting geographic hospital-specific variations, 
little published clinical demographic characteristics of
the patients, even less economic consequences cesarean section
delivery compared vaginal delivery [e.g. total hospital charges and
length neonatal intensive care unit-nicu-stay] birth episode. examine 
these relationships further, three urban baltimore hospitals volunteered 2004 
to participate retrospective chart review linked mother child
hospital records.
methods: 1172 mother-child records randomly selected data regarding
maternal co-morbidities, age, infant weight along transfer neonatal
intensive care units, economic data extracted mother child 
charts.
conclusion: average total charges vaginal deliveries [maternal plus total
baby charges includes nicu utilization (x=$17 624.38)] may higher than
average total charges cesarean sections [maternal plus total baby charges
that includes nicu utilization (x=$13 805.47)]. specifically, maternal
race--being african american--was indirectly associated overall charges
through association mode delivery nicu utilization patterns. 
presence maternal co-morbidities--herpes simplex virus, hypertension and
diabetes--most probably influenced babies' hospital stay charges well nicu 
charges transferred nicu following vaginal cesarean section
deliveries. thus, prenatal care targeting co-morbidities management may reduce
the odds newborn's transfer nicu thus avoiding greater lengths stay,
medical care charges. recommendations obstetrical practices well as
health care policy charges assume cesarean section
deliveries always costlier vaginal deliveries.
