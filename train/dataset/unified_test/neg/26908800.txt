background: centers disease control prevention (cdc) recommends
1-time hepatitis c virus (hcv) testing 1945-1965 birth cohort, addition
to targeted risk-based testing. emergency departments (eds) key venues for
hcv testing population served success hiv screening. we
determined burden undocumented hcv infection ed, providing guidance
for implementation ed-based hcv testing.
methods: 8-week seroprevalence study conducted urban ed 2013. all
patients excess blood collected clinical purposes included.
demographic clinical information including documented hcv infection was
obtained electronic medical records. hcv antibody testing performed on
excess samples.
results: 4713 patients, 652 (13.8%) hcv antibody positive. these, 204 
(31.3%) undocumented hcv infection. among patients undocumented
infections, 99 (48.5%) would diagnosed based birth cohort testing,
and additional 54 (26.5%) would identified risk-based testing. ed
adhered cdc guidelines, 51 (25.0%) patients undocumented hcv would
not tested. given estimated 7727 unique ed patients hcv
infection 1-year period, birth cohort plus risk-based testing would identify
1815 undocumented infections, universal testing would identify additional 526
hcv-infected persons.
conclusions: birth cohort-based testing would augment identification of
undocumented hcv infections ed 2-fold, relative risk-based testing
only. however, data demonstrate one-quarter infections would remain
undiagnosed current cdc birth cohort recommendations employed, suggesting
that high-risk urban ed settings practice universal 1-time testing might 
be effective.
