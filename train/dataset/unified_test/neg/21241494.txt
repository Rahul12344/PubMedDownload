background: chinese government provided health services infected
by human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (aids) care policy since 2003. detailed research actual
expenditures costs providing care patients aids needed for
future financial planning aids health care services possible reform of
hiv/aids-related policy. purpose current study determine the
actual expenditures factors influencing costs untreated aids patients 
a rural area china initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy
(haart) national free care program (china cares).
methods: retrospective cohort study conducted yunnan shanxi
provinces, haart medical care provided free hiv-positive
patients. health expenditures costs first treatment year were
collected medical records prescriptions local hospitals between
january june 2007. multivariate linear regression used determine the
factors associated actual expenditures first antiretroviral (arv)
treatment year.
results: five arv regimens commonly used china cares: zidovudine (azt) +
lamivudine (3tc) + nevirapine (nvp), stavudine (d4t) + 3tc + efavirenz (efv), d4t
+ 3tc + nvp, didanosine (ddi) + 3tc + nvp combivir + efv. mean annual
expenditure per person arv medications us$2,242 (us$1 = 7 chinese yuan
(cny)) among 276 participants. total costs treating adverse drug
events (ades) opportunistic infections (ois) us$29,703 us$23,031,
respectively. expenses treatment peripheral neuritis and
cytomegalovirus (cmv) infections highest among patients ades 
and ois, respectively. basis multivariate linear regression, cd4 cell
counts (100-199 cells/μl versus <100 cells/μl, p = 0.02; ≥200 cells/μl versus
<100 cells/μl, p < 0.004), residence mangshi county (p < 0.0001), ades (p =
0.04) ois (p = 0.02) significantly associated total expenditures in
the first arv treatment year.
conclusions: first study determine actual costs hiv
treatment rural areas china. costs arv drugs represented major
portion hiv medical expenditures. initiating haart patients higher cd4
cell count levels likely reduce treatment expenses ades ois in
patients aids.
