impaired capacity thrombin generation (tg) found single-donor
fresh-frozen plasma (ffp) units subjected medical device treatment a
combination methylene-blue dye subsequent white-light exposure (mb plasma,
mbp) compared normal levels non-mb-treated single-donor ffp, licensed
plasma product octaplas, product development (uniplas; working title)
applicable independently recipient's blood group. result held true 
for mbp units obtained two different european sources revealing more
significant tg impairment using local inactivation system blood banks
("in-house") industrial mb treatment. supplementation functional
fibrinogen physiological levels normalise altered tg capacity in
mbp, whereas addition octaplas did. clear-cut correlation between
coagulation factor levels mbp hampered tg capacity found, suggesting a
composite effect impairment. thorough elucidation evaluation regarding
the possible clinical impact findings seems prudent.
