quantification measles virus antigens infected cns tissue: development of
an enzyme linked immunoassay.

kabacoff cm, carrigan dr.

an enzyme linked immunoassay procedure developed allows accurate
quantification low levels measles virus antigens infected central
nervous system (cns) tissues. development systematic study made of
the effects large excess nonviral proteins assay results. was
found controls using single proteins bovine serum albumin were
inadequate. further, results indicate experimental samples viral antigen
standards must closely matched content cns tissue proteins since 
such proteins exert distinctive quantitative effects, dramatic subtle.
