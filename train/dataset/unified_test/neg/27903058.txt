influenza-like illness (ili) acute respiratory disease remains a
public health concern ability circulate globally affecting age
group gender causing serious illness mortality risk. comprehensive
assessment spatio-temporal dynamics ili prerequisite effective
risk assessment application control measures. though meteorological
parameters, rainfall, average relative humidity temperature,
influence ili represent crucial information control disease, 
relation disease variables clearly understood in
tropical climates. aim study analyse epidemiology ili
cases using integrated methods (space-time analysis, spatial autocorrelation 
other correlation statistics). 2009s h1n1 influenza pandemic, phitsanulok
province northern thailand strongly affected ili many years. this
study based ili cases villages province 2005 2012. we
used highly precise weekly incidence records covering eight years, allowed 
accurate estimation ili outbreak. comprehensive methodology developed 
to analyse global local patterns spread disease.
significant space-time clusters detected study region eight 
different periods. ili cases showed seasonal clustered patterns peak in
2010 (p&gt;0.05-9.999 iterations). local indicators spatial association
identified hotspots year. statistically, weather pattern showed a
clear influence ili cases strongly correlated humidity lag of
1 month, temperature weaker correlation.
