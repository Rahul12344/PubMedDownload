structure-anti hiv activity relationships established sample 80
1-[2-hydroxyethoxy-methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (hept) using three-layer
neural network (nn). eight structural descriptors physicochemical variables
were used characterize hept derivatives study. network's
architecture parameters optimized order obtain good results. all
the nn architectures able establish satisfactory relationship between
the molecular descriptors anti-hiv activity. nn proved give better
results models literature. nn shown be
particularly successful ability identify non-linear relationships.
