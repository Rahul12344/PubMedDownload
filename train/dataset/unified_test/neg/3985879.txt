quail embryo fibroblasts used investigate rabbit chicken antisera
against chicken erythrocytes carrying different b alleles major
histocompatibility antigens affect neutralization herpesvirus turkeys
(hvt). although neutralizing activities antisera rather low,
the hvt propagated chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef) certain genotypic
embryos neutralized antisera corresponding erythrocytes.
after absorption antisera homologous erythrocytes, neutralizing
activity absorbed sera reduced slightly. results reveal the
virion antigens hvt might partially associated host cell antigens 
of fibroblast infected virus. virus grown cells might
incorporate host cell antigens, including histocompatibility antigens, into
the virion envelope.
