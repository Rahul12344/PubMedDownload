qbeta f2 rna. response changes phage rna concentrations similar
in systems, reaching saturation level 0.75 1.0 mg rna per ml
of reaction mixture. analysis complete reaction mixtures pp7 rna of
the qbeta rna systems sucrose gradient centrifugation shows generally similar 
patterns rnas. principal differences pp7 system a
slightly higher percentage rna forms ribosome complexes polysomes
are somewhat smaller. pp7 rna also degraded extensively the
reaction qbeta rna. analysis products reactions by
acrylamide gel electrophoresis shows pp7 coat protein only
identifiable product pp7 rna-directed system, suggesting the
coat protein cistron translated e. coli ribosomes.
