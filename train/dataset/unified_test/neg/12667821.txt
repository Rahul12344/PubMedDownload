we developed robust, ultrasensitive, accurate quantitative assays for
maedi-visna virus (mvv) rna dna genomic sequences mrna's expressed at
various stages lentiviral replication. assay design based pcr with
real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements. specific assays
were developed gag-pol (genomic), tat, rev, env, vif transcripts. assay
linearity ranged 60 6 x 10(7) copies target dna. assays able 
to detect measure corresponding mrna's mvv-infected fos cells, whereas 
signal detected mock-treated cells. addition, rt-pcr based on
amplification gag sequences could used quantify rna genomic sequences in
supernatants infected cells. quantitative assays used study 
the role genetic elements mvv infection pathogenesis. also allow
rapid testing lentiviral vectors packaging systems based mvv.
