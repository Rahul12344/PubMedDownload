highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses subtype h5n1 (hpaiv-h5n1) have
circulated continuously asia, europe, africa since 2003. investigations on
the environmental preference global spread processes virus needed.
we compiled 16 environmental variables assess correlation with
hpaiv-h5n1 occurrences using niche-based model called maxent. found the
virus strongest positive association human footprint index, as
well presence certain types wetlands mild temperature (10-30 c).
outbreaks hpaiv-h5n1 poultry wild birds also frequent in
certain major habitat types (e.g., tropical subtropical moist broadleaf
forests, temperate broadleaf mixed forests, flooded grasslands and
savannas) ecoregions. conducted trend surface analysis generate the
travelling wave virus' global spread 2003 2009, indicated
that high mountains plateaus affect spread speed direction.
