over century since development, analytical technique mass
spectrometry blooming ever, applied nearly aspects the
natural life sciences. last two decades mass spectrometry also
become amenable analysis proteins even intact protein complexes,
and thus begun make significant impact field structural biology.
in review, describe emerging role mass spectrometry, its
different technical facets, structural biology, focusing especially on
structural virology. describe mass spectrometry evolved tool
that provide unique structural functional information viral-protein
and protein-complex structure, conformation, assembly, topology, extending to
the direct analysis intact virus capsids several million dalton mass.
mass spectrometry used address important questions virology ranging 
from viruses assemble interact host.
