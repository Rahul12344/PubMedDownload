purpose: propose novel clinical typing classification focusing the
distinct progression patterns nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc), supplement
our knowledge clinical-biological behavior, provide useful knowledge
for treatment planning, contribute basic research npc.
methods: 632 consecutive patients retrospectively reviewed analyzed
according novel typing system. considered npc divided 
5 types follows: limited (l), ascending (a), descending (d) ascending-
descending (mixed) (ad), distant metastasis types (m). distribution of
these clinical types, association epstein-barr virus (ebv) serology
and prognostic value explored.
results: 55 (8.70%), 59 (9.34%), 177 (28.01%), 321 (50.79%) 20 (3.16%)
patients classified type l, a, d, ad m, respectively. ebv (vca)-iga
titers, ebv early antigen (ea)-iga serum titers, capsid antigen lg(ebv dna)
were positively associated clinical typing (p<0.05). 3-year overall 
survival (os) rates types l, a, d, ad 100, 100, 95.10, 88.20 and
59.30%, respectively (p<0.001). prognostic model constructed based on
pretreatment lg (ebv dna) clinical type, independent predictors of
os (multivariate cox proportional model). prognostic model stratified
patients 4 risk subgroups. 3-year os rates low, intermediate,
high extremely high risk groups 99.5, 90.0, 85.5 53.2%, respectively
(p<0.001). compared low-risk group, risk death 4.96, 8.75 and
35.9 intermediate, high extremely high risk groups, respectively
(p<0.001). model also predicted os independently tnm classification.
conclusion: novel clinical typing system prognostic model supplement
tnm classification, may help design novel treatment strategies, evaluate risk
stratification investigate varied biological characteristics npc.
