amplification human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) lytic origin (orilyt) human 
fibroblasts dependent upon six core replication proteins ul84, ie2, and
ul36-38. using telomerase-immortalized human fibroblast cell line (t-hfs),
orilyt-dependent dna replication longer required gene products ul36-38.
to determine role ie2 dna replication human fibroblasts, examined
potential ie2-binding sites within hcmv orilyt. show strong
bidirectional promoter (orilyt(pm)) (nucleotides 91754 92030) located in
the previously identified core region origin required efficient
amplification orilyt. determined 14-bp novel dna motif (orilyt
promoter activation element), initially identified binding element
for immediate-early protein ie2, essential orilyt(pm) activity. in
vero cells orilyt(pm) constitutively active strongly repressed by
ie2, reactivated ul84. contrast, transfection orilyt(pm) 
into human fibroblasts resulted low basal level promoter activity
that dramatically up-regulated upon infection hcmv. cotransfection
assays demonstrated transfection ul84 along ie2 transactivated
the orilyt(pm) human fibroblasts. activation observed upon
cotransfection set plasmids expressing entire replication complex. 
efficient orilyt amplification absence ie2 human fibroblasts was
observed replacing orilyt(pm) simian virus 40 early promoter.
under conditions, however, ul84 still required amplification of
orilyt. results suggest mechanism initiation hcmv lytic
replication part involves transcriptional activation.
