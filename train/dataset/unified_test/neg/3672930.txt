the nucleotide sequence gene immediately following nucleocapsid
protein gene sonchus yellow net virus (synv), plant rhabdovirus, is
presented. serological reactions synv proteins antibodies elicited a
fusion protein constructed sequenced gene indicate gene
encodes synv structural protein designated m2. 5' end m2 protein
mrna appears correspond position 1700 relative 3' end synv rna,
because extension product maps position synthesized by
reverse transcription polyadenylated [poly(a)+] rna infected tobacco that
had primed synv-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide. 3' end the
gene encoding m2 protein defined recombinant dna plasmid derived from
poly(a)+ rna synv-infected plants. plasmid contains insert a
3'-terminal region corresponding uridylate-rich sequence present at
positions 2832 2836 synv genomic (g) rna. data thus suggest 
m2 protein mrna 1132 nucleotides (nt) long, excluding poly(a) tail, and
consists 50-nt untranslated 5' region, 1035-nt open reading frame (orf),
and 47-nt untranslated 3'region. orf capable encoding 345-amino
acid protein calculated molecular weight 38,332. small region 
m2 protein appears similarity phosphoproteins other
rhabdoviruses. identical 14-nt region occurs two sequenced gene
junctions synv grna shares homology regions separating genes of
some animal rhabdoviruses.
