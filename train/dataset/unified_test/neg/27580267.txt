we evaluated potential transmission avian influenza viruses (aiv) in
wildlife species three settings association outbreak poultry
facility: 1) small birds small mammals poultry facility was
affected highly pathogenic aiv (hpaiv) april 2015; 2) small birds and
small mammals nearby poultry facility unaffected hpaiv; 3)
small birds, small mammals, waterfowl nearby natural area. we
live-captured small birds small mammals collected samples from
hunter-harvested waterfowl test active viral shedding evidence of
exposure (serum antibody) aiv h5n2 hpaiv affected poultry
facility. detected evidence shedding specific antibody aiv in
small mammals small birds 5 mo depopulation poultry. detected
viral shedding exposure aiv waterfowl estimated approximately 15%
viral shedding 60% antibody prevalence. waterfowl, detect
shedding exposure hpaiv affected poultry facility. also
conducted camera trapping around poultry carcass depopulation composting barns
and found regular visitation four species medium-sized mammals. provide 
preliminary data suggesting peridomestic wildlife important
factor transmission aiv poultry outbreak, small
birds mammals natural wetland settings show wide evidence aiv shedding 
or exposure, despite opportunity exposure.
