restriction-modification (rm) systems cognate gene complexes code an
endonuclease methylase. often thought developed in
bacteria protection invading genetic material, e.g., phage dna. the
high diversity rm systems, observed nature, often ascribed the
coevolution rm systems (which 'invent' novel types) phages. however, the
extent phages insensitive rm systems casts doubts the
effectiveness rm systems protection infection thereby the
reason diversity rm systems. present eco-evolutionary model in
order study evolution diversity rm systems. model predicts
that general diversity rm systems high. importantly, diversity 
of rm systems expressed either individual level the
population level. first case individuals carry rm systems all
sequence specificities, whereas second case carry one rm system 
or rm systems all. nevertheless, second case number of
sequence specificities present population.
