at least seven viral genes encode proteins (ul6, ul15, ul17, ul25, ul28, ul32,
and ul33) required dna cleavage packaging herpes simplex
virus type 1 (hsv-1) dna. sequence analysis reveals ul15 shares homology
with gp17, large catalytic subunit bacteriophage t4 terminase. thus,
ul15 may play direct role cleavage viral dna replication
intermediates monomers. study, asked whether ul15 other
cleavage packaging proteins could detected capsids isolated from
infected cells. consistent previous studies showing ul6 ul25 are
minor protein constituents capsids, detected proteins b
and c capsids. contrast, previously identified full-length version (81
kda) ul15 found predominantly b capsids much smaller amounts 
c capsids. addition, ul28 protein found predominantly b c
capsids distribution similar 81-kda version ul15. these
results suggest ul28 81-kda form ul15 transiently associated 
with capsid intermediates packaging process. surprisingly, however, 
previously unidentified 87-kda form ul15 found b c capsids 
in virions. analysis cells infected mutants individually lacking ul6,
ul15, ul25, ul28, ul32 demonstrates lack one cleavage and
packaging protein affect expression others. furthermore, this
analysis, together guanidine hcl extraction analysis purified capsids,
indicates ul6, ul25, ul28 able associate b capsids the
absence dna cleavage packaging proteins. hand, two 
ul15-related proteins (81 87 kda) associate efficiently b capsids
in cells infected ul6 ul28 mutants. results suggest the
ability ul15-related proteins bind b capsids may mediated through
interactions ul6 ul28.
