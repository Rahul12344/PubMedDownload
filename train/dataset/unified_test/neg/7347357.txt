we prospectively investigated possibility type b hepatitis might be
transmitted fiberoptic endoscopy hepatitis b surface antigen
(hbsag)-positive patients others subsequently endoscoped. 186 patients
having upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 6-month period the
washington, d.c., veterans administration medical center blood sample
obtained time procedure. three patients found be
hbsag-positive 45 others either antibody hbsag (anti-hbs) or
antibody hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc). follow-up evaluation for
evidence type b hepatitis hepatitis b virus infection possible only
76% patients. one patient developed type b hepatitis. patient's endoscopy
did follow endoscopy known hbsag-positive individual, had
received five units blood 5 months hepatitis developed. other
patient showed clinical, biochemical, serologic evidence hepatitis during
the follow-up period. data suggest transmission type b hepatitis
during fiberoptic endoscopy rare, occurs all, support current
policy sterilizing fiberoptic endoscope procedures 
routinely screening patients hbsag.
