objective: develop dietary methyl donor food frequency questionnaire
(dmd-ffq) validated cohort us children determine whether
the consumption folate vitamin b12, principal dmds, correlates hbv
dna levels methylation density.
study design: developed semiquantitative dmd-ffq estimate intake of
folate vitamin b12 validated instrument 24-hour dietary
recall biomarkers-red blood cell folate, serum vitamin b12, and
homocysteine-in 35 children chronic hbv infection without medical
comorbidities. estimates dmd, well serum biomarkers, correlated
with methylation density hbv cpg island 2 hbv dna levels.
results: folate per kilogram body weight dmd-ffq correlated positively 
with 24-hour recall (r = 0.60; p < .001) red blood cell folate (r = 0.40;
p = .02), negatively homocysteine (r = -0.54; p < .001). vitamin b12 per
kilogram dmd-ffq also correlated positively 24-hour recall (r = 0.57;
p < .001) serum vitamin b12 (r = 0.36, p = .04), negatively with
homocysteine (r = -0.44; p = .008). neither dmd intake (from dmd-ffq 24-hour
recall) serum biomarkers correlated hbv dna levels methylation
density.
conclusions: dmd-ffq correlates well 24-hour recall circulating
biomarkers. although little evidence existed consumption these
micronutrients correlated hbv replication, tool could prove useful 
investigating epigenetic modification diet several pediatric diseases.
