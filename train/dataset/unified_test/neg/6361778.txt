zinc deficiency human subjects.

prasad as.

during past two decades, essentiality zinc man been
established. deficiency zinc man due nutritional factors several
diseased states recognized. high phytate content cereal proteins
decreases availability zinc; thus prevalence zinc deficiency likely 
to high population subsisting mainly cereal proteins. alcoholism is
known cause hyperzincuria thus may play role producing zinc
deficiency man. malabsorption, cirrhosis liver, chronic renal disease
and chronically debilitating diseases may similarly induce zinc deficiency 
in human subjects. severe deficiency zinc recently recognized to
occur patients sickle cell anemia beneficial effect zinc therapy
in patients reported. growth retardation, male hypogonadism, skin
changes, poor appetite, mental lethargy delayed wound healing the
manifestations chronically zinc-deficient human subjects. taste abnormalities,
correctable zinc supplementation, observed uremic subjects.
recently, abnormal dark adaptation related zinc deficiency patients with
cirrhosis liver sickle cell disease reported. severely
zinc-deficient patients, dermatological manifestations, diarrhea, alopecia,
mental disturbances intercurrent infections predominate untreated 
condition becomes fatal. zinc deficiency known affect testicular functions 
adversely man animals. effect zinc end organ level and
it appears zinc essential spermatogenesis testosterone
steroidogenesis. zinc involved many biochemical functions. several zinc
metalloenzymes recognized past decade. zinc required each
step cell cycle microorganisms essential dna synthesis.
thymidine kinase, rna polymerase, dna-polymerase various sources and
rna-dependent dna polymerase viruses shown zinc-dependent
enzymes. zinc also regulates activity rnase; thus catabolism rna
appears zinc-dependent. effect zinc protein synthesis may be
attributable vital role nucleic acid metabolism. activities many
zinc-dependent enzymes shown affected adversely zinc-deficient
tissues. three enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, carboxypeptidase thymidine
kinase, appear sensitive zinc restriction activities 
are affected adversely within three six days institution a
zinc-deficient diet experimental animals.(abstract truncated 400 words)
