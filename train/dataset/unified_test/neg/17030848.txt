the receptor internalization degradation (rid) complex adenovirus plays an
important role modulating immune response downregulating surface
levels tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (tnfr1), thereby inhibiting nf-kappab
activation. total cellular content tnfr1 also reduced presence of
rid, inhibited treatment lysosomotropic agents. this
report, surface biotinylation experiments revealed that, although rid tnfr1
were able form complex cell surface, rate tnfr1 endocytosis
was affected rid. however, degradation internalized tnfr1 was
enhanced significantly presence rid. therefore, data suggest that
rid downregulates tnfr1 levels altering fate internalized tnfr1 that
becomes associated rid plasma membrane, probably promoting its
sorting endosomal/lysosomal degradation compartments.
