we recently reported different purification methods recombinant
adeno-associated virus type 2 (raav2) affect transduction characteristics
following subretinal injection. study, examined roles of
contaminant proteins hek-293 cells helper adenovirus, inactivation
of helper adenovirus cell stress induced dna-damaging agents in
raav-mediated retinal transduction. results showed contaminating
factors/proteins resulting helper e1 deleted adenovirus possibly
responsible efficient rpe transduction. future studies factors 
undoubtedly lead development new therapeutic approaches pr- and
rpe-specific retinal diseases.
