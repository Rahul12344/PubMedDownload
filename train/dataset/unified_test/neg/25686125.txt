in south africa, outbreaks african horse sickness (ahs) occur summer; no
cases reported winter, july september. ahs virus (ahsv) is
transmitted almost exclusively culicoides midges (diptera: ceratopogonidae),
of culicoides imicola considered important vector. the
over-wintering mechanism ahsv unknown. study, 500 000
culicoides midges belonging least 26 species collected 88 light
traps weekly intervals july 2010 september 2011 near horses the
onderstepoort area south africa. dominant species c. imicola. despite 
relatively low temperatures frost, least 17 species, including c. imicola,
were collected throughout winter (june-august). although mean number of
midges per night fell &gt; 50 000 (march) &lt; 100 (july august), 
midge-free periods found. study, using virus isolation cell cultures
and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay, confirmed
low infection prevalence field midges detection virus
correlated high numbers. although virus detected winter
period, continuous adult activity indicated transmission potentially
occur. absence ahsv midges winter ascribed the
relatively low numbers collected coupled low infection prevalence, low virus
replication rates low virus titres potentially infected midges. cases 
of ahs susceptible animals likely start soon culicoides
populations reach critical level.
