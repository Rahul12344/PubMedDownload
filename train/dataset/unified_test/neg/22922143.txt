neutrophils one first cells immune system recruited site
of infection, representing host's effective numerous front-line
defenders. recently, novel antimicrobial mechanism neutrophils been
described: upon activation, release dna subset granule
content, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). extracellular,
chromatin structures, contain histones neutrophil granule proteins, can
trap kill broad spectrum microbes, including gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria, fungi, protozoa viruses. pathogens, which
are trapped exposed high local concentrations antimicrobial compounds, 
employ strategies net binding, including surface modification and/or
degradation net dnases. suggested nets formed during
active cell death, recently named netosis. new data indicate novel
mechanism cell death requires interaction three processes--reactive
oxygen species generation, histone citrullination autophagy--and
significantly differs previously known types cell death, including
apoptosis necrosis. moreover, release nuclear chromatin also
described types cells--mast cells eosinophils. mast cells, like 
neutrophils, certain conditions release nuclear chromatin may undergo a
similar active cell death program, eosinophils release mitochondrial
chromatin, release lead death cells.
