etravirine (etv) second-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (rt) 
inhibitor (nnrti) introduced recently salvage antiretroviral treatment 
the emergence nnrti-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1).
following introduction, two naturally occurring mutations hiv-1 rt, v106i 
and v179d, listed etv resistance-associated mutations. however, the
effect mutations development nnrti resistance been
analyzed yet. select highly nnrti-resistant hiv-1 vitro, monoclonal hiv-1
strains harboring v106i v179d (hiv-1(v106i) hiv-1(v179d)) propagated
in presence increasing concentrations efavirenz (efv). interestingly,
v179d emerged one three selection experiments hiv-1(v106i) v106i
emerged two three experiments hiv-1(v179d). analysis recombinant
hiv-1 clones showed combination v106i v179d conferred significant
resistance efv nevirapine (nvp) etv. structural analysis
indicated etv overcome repulsive interactions caused the
combination v106i v179d fine-tuning binding module rt
facilitated plastic structure, whereas efv nvp cannot their
rigid structures. analysis clinical isolates showed comparable drug
susceptibilities, combination mutations found some
database patients experienced virologic nnrti-based treatment failure. the
combination v106i v179d newly identified nnrti resistance pattern 
mutations. combination polymorphic minor resistance-associated
mutations interpreted carefully.
