although efforts develop vaccine hiv far met little
success, recent studies hiv-positive patients strongly neutralizing sera 
have shown human immune system capable producing potent and
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs), neutralize 90% of
hiv strains. antibodies bind conserved vulnerable sites viral
envelope glycoprotein gp120, identification sites provided
exciting clues design potentially effective vaccines. carbohydrates 
have key role field, large fraction bnabs bind carbohydrates or
combinations carbohydrate peptide elements gp120. additionally,
carbohydrates partially mask peptide surfaces recognized bnabs. use
of engineered glycoproteins glycostructures vaccines elicit
antibodies broad neutralizing activity therefore key area interest
in hiv vaccine design.
