the ns1 protein influenza viruses major virulence factor exerts its
function interacting viral/cellular rnas proteins. this
study, identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a2/b1 (hnrnp a2/b1) 
as interacting partner ns1 proteins proteomic method. knockdown of
hnrnp a2/b1 small interfering rna (sirna) resulted higher levels ns
vrna, ns1 mrna, ns1 protein virus-infected cells. addition, we
demonstrated hnrnp a2/b1 proteins associated ns1 ns2 mrnas 
that knockdown hnrnp a2/b1 promotes transport ns1 mrna nucleus 
the cytoplasm infected cells. lastly, showed knockdown hnrnp
a2/b1 leads enhanced virus replication. results suggest hnrnp a2/b1
plays inhibitory role replication influenza virus host cells
potentially suppressing ns1 rna/protein levels ns1 mrna
nucleocytoplasmic translocation.
