the ribosomal protein l22 component 60s eukaryotic ribosomal subunit.
as rna-binding protein, shown interact cellular and
viral rnas including 28s rrna epstein-barr virus encoded rna, eber-1. l22
is localized cell nucleus accumulates nucleoli. although
previous studies demonstrated specific amino acid sequence required for
nucleolar localization, rna-binding domain identified. here, 
investigated hypothesis nucleolar accumulation l22 linked to
its ability bind rna. address hypothesis, mutated l22 proteins were
generated assess contribution specific amino acids rna binding and
protein localization. using rna-protein binding assays, demonstrate basic
amino acids 80-93 required high affinity binding 28s rrna eber-1
by l22. fluorescence localization studies using gfp-tagged mutated l22 proteins
further reveal basic amino acids 80-93 critical nucleolar
accumulation incorporation ribosomes. data support growing
consensus nucleolar accumulation ribosomal proteins may be
mediated defined localization signal, rather specific interaction
with established nucleolar components rrna.
