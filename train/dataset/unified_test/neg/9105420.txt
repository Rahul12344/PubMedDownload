co-infection virus bacteria happens frequently often results an
exacerbated clinical course disease, possibly due mechanisms including 
altered cytokine production. present study, authors investigated the
combined effects avirulent semliki forest virus (sfv-a7) bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (lps) interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) il-2 gene
expression murine splenic cells. authors found 10 ng/ml lps the
culture medium induced expression il-1 beta il-2, infection with
sfv-a7 induce either two cytokines. however, sfv-a7 lps
were applied together, synergistic increase il-1 beta il-2 was
observed. experiments showed addition sfv-a7 3 h lps
enhanced, whereas addition virus 3 h lps inhibited, il-1 beta
gene expression. results indicate interaction virus and
gram-negative bacteria result altered cytokine gene expression.
