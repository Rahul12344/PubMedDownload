the safety immunogenicity four adjuvanted formulations an
investigational tetravalent dengue purified inactivated vaccine (dpiv) were
evaluated predominantly dengue-primed population puerto rico. this
placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, phase trial, 100 healthy adults
were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 receive dpiv day (d)0 d28 (1 μg per dengue
virus [denv] type 1-4 adjuvanted either alum, as01e as03b, 4 μg per
denv type adjuvanted alum) saline placebo. functional antibody responses 
were assessed using microneutralization assay d56, month (m)7, m13. 
dpiv formulations well tolerated safety signals identified
through m13. m13 according-to-protocol (atp) immunogenicity cohort included
83 participants. atp analysis immunogenicity performed 78 
subjects seropositive ≥ 1 denv type baseline: 69 tetravalent, three
trivalent, two bivalent, four monovalent. dpiv groups, geometric mean 
antibody titers (gmts) increased d0 d56 waned modestly m13,
while remaining well prevaccination levels. 4 μg + alum as01e- 
and as03b-adjuvanted formulations highly immunogenic, m13-neutralizing 
antibody gmts four denv types 1,000. m13/d0 gmt ratios were
highest 1 μg + as03b group (ranging 3.2-3.7 depending denv type).
these results encourage continued clinical development dpiv
