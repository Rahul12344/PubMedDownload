the complete nucleotide sequence cymbidium mosaic virus (cymmv) isolated 
vanilla hainan province, china determined first time. comprised
6,224 nucleotides; sequence analysis suggested isolate obtained a
member genus potexvirus, sequence shared 86.67-96.61% identities
with previously reported sequences. phylogenetic analysis suggested cymmv
from vanilla fragrans clustered subgroup isolates this
subgroup displayed little regional difference.
