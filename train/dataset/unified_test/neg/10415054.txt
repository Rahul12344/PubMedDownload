mice infected adenovirus mutant e3 region deleted,
including tnf-resistance genes, develop fatal liver pathology within 3-4 days
after infection. least 10-fold wild-type virus needed cause
comparable pathology. results indicate e3 region critically
involved modulating pathogenesis adenovirus infection tnf may 
play role liver damage. explore latter possibility, course of
disease examined infected mice lacking tnfr-i and/or tnfrii, tnf only, 
both tnf lymphotoxin-alpha. mice lacking tnfri tnfrii were
protected lethal affects mutant adenovirus. mice deficient tnf
or tnf lymphotoxin-alpha displayed fatal pathology. outcome is
consistent existence another related ligand binds tnfri/ii to
mediate liver damage infection mutant.
