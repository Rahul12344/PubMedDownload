three papillomaviruses (pvs) domestic cat fully sequenced so
far including felis domesticus pv-1 (fdpv-1), fdpv-2, recently described
felis catus pv-3 (fcapv-4). current article, describe full genomic 
sequence fourth pv domestic cat. pv amplified the
oral cavity cat severe gingivitis. however, aetiological
involvement fcapv-4 development lesions observed cat remains
uncertain. complete genome novel virus comprised 7,616 bp was
predicted encode five early (e1, e2, e4, e6 e7) two late (l1 l2)
genes, organisation typical pvs. l1 showed 65.1 % nucleotide
sequence identity l1 fcapv-3 approximately 60 % identity l1 of
canine tau-papillomaviruses cpv-2 cpv-7. novel virus clustered with
fcapv-3, cpv-2 cpv-7 phylogenetic tree constructed concatenated
alignment 3,013 bp e1, e2, l1 l2. based genomic and
phylogenetic data, propose novel virus classified distinct
species within genus fcapv-3. also propose viruses are
classified within genus taupapillomavirus, although classification may
need re-visited tau-pv genomes become available.
