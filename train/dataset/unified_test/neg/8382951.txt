an international survey redo lung transplantation performed identify
the morbidity mortality rates factors correlating increased or
decreased survival procedure. twenty institutions north america and
europe participated, study cohort included 61 patients underwent 63
redo lung transplantation operations. patients undergoing redo heart-lung
transplantation excluded. indications reoperation included
obliterative bronchiolitis (32 patients), graft failure (14 patients),
intractable airway problems (8 patients), severe acute lung rejection (5
patients), miscellaneous complications (4 patients). five types of
retransplantation procedures performed, including redo ipsilateral single
lung transplantation (24 patients), redo contralateral single lung
transplantation (11 patients), single lung transplantation double lung or
heart-lung transplantation (13 patients), redo double lung transplantation (8
patients), double lung transplantation previous single lung
transplantation (7 patients). actuarial survival 65%, 49%, 42%, 35%, 32% 
at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months, respectively; survival significantly (p <
0.05) worse first-time lung transplant recipients recorded the
international society heart lung transplantation registry. actuarial
survival differ according original diagnosis recipients,
the indication reoperation, type retransplantation procedure
performed. similarly, recipient cytomegalovirus status ventilator status
before reoperation affect postoperative survival. trends toward an
improved outcome noted patients ambulatory reoperation
and receiving abo identical, opposed abo compatible, graft at
reoperation. life table step-wise logistic regression analysis identified
donor cytomegalovirus status reoperation important determinant of
outcome, significantly (p < 0.05) improved survival donor
cytomegalovirus-negative group. polymicrobial infection common cause
of death time intervals reoperation. presence disseminated
infection established multiorgan failure almost uniformly associated with
a fatal outcome. conclude redo lung transplantation may indicated only
in well-selected patients obliterative bronchiolitis, severe airway
complications, graft failure. donor cytomegalovirus status reoperation is
an important predictor survival. presence disseminated infection and
established multiorgan failure contraindications lung
retransplantation.
