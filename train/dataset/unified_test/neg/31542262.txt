whole inactivated avian influenza virus, subtype h9n2. total 166 one-day-old
specific pathogen free layer chickens (spf) randomly assigned treatments,
where combination antibiotic depletion, probiotics (a combination of
five lactobacillus species) fecal microbial transplant (fmt) reconstitution
were used study dynamics cell- antibody-mediated immune responses
to primary secondary vaccinations days 15 29 age, respectively.
overall, days 7 14 post primary vaccination (p.p.v.), administration of
probiotics non-depleted chickens resulted significantly higher mean
hemagglutination (hi) titre compared antibiotic treated chickens. furthermore,
at day 21 p.p.v., chickens treated probiotics fmt post-antibiotic
treatment showed significantly higher mean hi titre compared non-depleted
chickens treated probiotics. day 7 p.p.v., significantly higher virus
specific igm igg titres observed non-depleted chickens administered
with probiotics compared antibiotic depleted chickens, significantly
higher igg titre observed chickens treated fmt following antibiotic
treatment compared antibiotic treatment. analysis interferon gamma
expression splenocytes assess cell-mediated immune responses showed a
significantly lower expression antibiotic-treated chickens compared to
non-depleted chickens fmt reconstituted chickens. taken together, current
study suggests shifts composition gut microbiota chickens may
result changes cell- antibody-mediated immune responses vaccination 
against influenza viruses. studies needed highlight the
mechanisms involved modulation.
