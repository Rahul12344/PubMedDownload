background: acute otitis media children significant clinical problem that
requires rational approach treatment. condition extremely common 
has important economic implications. present considerable controversy
over appropriate strategy use choice antibiotics.
objectives: analyze various factors influence therapeutic decisions
and consider may assist formulation rational approach to
therapy.
discussion: otitis media multifactorial etiology extremely
difficult differentiate bacterial viral causes clinical
grounds. culture middle ear fluid rarely practicable; however, nasal
swabs relatively noninvasive provide useful microbiologic
information, especially excluding bacterial cause. published information
provides little guidance appropriate therapy; rational approach 
treatment based many considerations including local epidemiology. the
minimum criteria empiric choice antibiotic acute otitis media
are rapidly bactericidal reach adequate concentrations in
the middle ear fluid. areas beta-lactamase-producing strains are
prevalent, beta-lactamase-stable antibiotic chosen; good absorption
from gastrointestinal tract high consistent penetration the
middle ear important characteristics. compliance-enhancing factors as
fewer doses per day good palatability also important.
