this experiment conducted study antiviral activities sodium
tanshinone iia sulfonate (sts) porcine reproductive respiratory
syndrome virus (prrsv) mechanism. anti-prrsv activities sts were
observed marc-145 cells using visualization cytopathologic effect assay 
and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) test, 
its antiviral mechanism determined time-of-addition assay, adsorption
inhibition assay, virucidal assay. results showed sts could reduce
the damage prrsv marc-145 cells, inhibition ratio exceeding to
100%, maximum non-cytotoxic concentration. time-of-addition and
virucidal assays indicated anti-prrsv activities sts could due 
inhibiting virus replication or/and inactivating virus directly. the
inhibition virus attachment discovered adsorption inhibition
assay. results proved sts strong anti-prrsv activity encouraged 
for exploration sts.
