telomerase activity examined 105 frozen samples human normal liver
tissues, chronic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). telomerase
activity positive 28 33 hcc tissues regardless tumor stage size. 
telomerase expressed 15 18 differentiated hcc nodules smaller 3
cm. hcc tissues eight hepatitis b virus-positive patients were
telomerase positive, telomerase activity detected normal liver
tissues (0 4). weak telomerase activity detected 1 22 nontumor 
liver tissues hcc patients. interestingly, 19 38 hepatitis tissues and
6 8 cirrhotic liver tissues apparently cancer-free patients, weak
telomerase activity detected. results indicate expression of
telomerase may play crucial role hepatocarcinogenesis.
