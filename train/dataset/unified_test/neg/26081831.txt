aichi viruses (aiv) detected patients diarrheal diseases (dd). 
the aim study assess aiv infection rates hospitalized children 
with dd, including 123 hiv-1 seropositive 125 hiv-1 seronegative patients, in
two public pediatric hospitals rio de janeiro, brazil. aiv investigated by
nested rt-pcr. aiv-positive samples also tested specie rotavirus, 
norovirus, astrovirus, enteric adenovirus bocavirus order assess
co-infections. aiv parcial genome sequencing phylogenetic analyses were
performed. aiv detected 9/123 (7.32%) hiv-1 seropositive subjects 
and 1/125 (0.8%) hiv seronegative patients dd (p = 0.019). the
phylogenetic analysis positive samples disclosed that: i) 13 samples were
characterized genotype a, one hiv-1 seronegative
patient; ii) one sample hiv-1 seropositive patient characterized as
genotype b. aiv genotype grouped 3 genetic clusters. data suggest that
aiv may opportunistic pathogen infecting children aids dd.
