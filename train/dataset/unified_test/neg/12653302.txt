western australia experienced worst-ever outbreak mosquito-borne
murray valley encephalitis (mve) virus 2000 wet season.
highest-on-record rainfall throughout much state 2000 wet
season gave rise extensive mosquito breeding increased mve virus
transmission, resulting nine cases encephalitis. activity mve virus in
western australia monitored detecting mve virus-specific antibodies in
serum sentinel chickens, located towns communities throughout the
north state. however, 2000, 28 flocks chickens seroconverted
to mve virus, including flock located >600 km south mve virus
activity ever previously recorded. furthermore, majority nine
cases encephalitis occurred outside enzootic kimberley region. we
therefore undertook major serosurvey domestic chicken flocks south 
east previously defined regions virus activity. results suggest
that mve virus activity extended far south midwest northern
goldfields 2000. new southern limit activity mve virus is
therefore proposed. results implications managing outbreaks mve
virus western australia enabled us locate additional sentinel
flocks part mve surveillance program future years.
