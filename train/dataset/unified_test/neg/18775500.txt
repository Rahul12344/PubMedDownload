a novel protein showing strong antiviral activities cucumber mosaic virus
(cmv) tomato mosaic virus (tmv) purified coelomic fluid the
earthworm eisenia foetida. protein characterized cold-adapted serine
protease. molecular weight estimated 27,000 sds-page. enzyme
was active ph 9.5 40-50 degrees c. protease activity 4 degrees
c 60% obtained optimal temperature. activity was
suppressed various serine protease inhibitors. partial n-terminal amino acid
sequence enzyme showed homology serine proteases earthworms, e.
foetida lumbricus rubellus previously studied. results suggest the
enzyme applicable potential antiviral factor cmv, tmv, and
other plant viruses.
