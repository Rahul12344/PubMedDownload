background: equid alphaherpesvirus 1 (ehv-1) one main infectious
causative agents abortion mares also associated stillbirth,
neonatal foal death, rhinopneumonitis young horses neurological disorder
called equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (ehm). neuropathogenicity of
the virus shown significantly higher ehv-1 strains carry a
single nucleotide point (snp) mutation orf30, encodes catalytic
subunit viral dna polymerase (orf30 d752). another gene, orf68 frequently
used phylogenetic analysis ehv-1.
methods: 27 ehv-1 strains isolated aborted equine fetuses poland,
collected 1993 2017, subjected pcr targeting open reading
frames (orfs) 30 68 ehv-1 genome. pcr products obtained sequenced
and snps analyzed compared sequences available genbank.
results: none analyzed sequences belonged orf30 d752neuropathogenic
genotype: ehv-1 belonged non-neuropathogenic variant n752. the
basis orf68 sequences, majority ehv-1 sequences (76.9%) cannot be
assigned known groups; six sequences (23.1%) clustered within 
groups ii iv.
conclusions: ehv-1 strains obtained abortion cases belong the
non-neuropathogenic genotype. many ehv-1 orf68 sequences similar snps to
those already described poland, clear geographical distribution 
observed. single particular orf68 sequence type observed strains
isolated 2001 onwards.
