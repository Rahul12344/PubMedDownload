background: hepatic flares (hf), reflect hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (iris), frequently occur patients 
with hbv human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) coinfection start of
antiretoroviral therapy (art). rate hepatitis b envelope antigen (hbeag)
and hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) loss higher patients hf after
the initiation art.
methods: retrospectively examined kinetics hbsag hbeag levels
of six hbv/hiv coinfected patients commencement art included
tenofovir. male hbeag positive.
results: three patients developed hf initiation art. all
subsequently lost hbeag one lost hbsag hf. none not
experience hf lost hbeag. hbsag hbeag levels remarkably decreased hf
occurred, decline hbsag slow periods 
hf. median decline hbsag level 48 weeks 2.20 log iu/ml for
patients hf, 1.00 log iu/ml patients without hf. little decline
was seen either group median decline hbsag level 48 weeks 
to 96 weeks, 0.28 log iu/ml hf group 0.06 log iu/ml non-hf
group.
conclusion: immune reconstitution hbv/hiv coinfected patient plays an
important role clearance hbv. hbsag hbeag levels decrease
rapidly hf occurs, hepatic flare would due hbv-related iris.
