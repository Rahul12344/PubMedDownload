uv (lambda = 254 nm) irradiation bacteriophage ms2 treatment with
bisulfite induce covalent crosslinkage rna coat protein.
epilsonn-(2-oxopyrimidyl-4)-lysine found phage hydrolysates after
either type treatment. equimolar mixture 0-methylhydroxylamine and
bisulfite causes complete disappearance cross-links. led the
conclusion one factors responsible uv-induced
polynucleotide-protein crosslinkage main factor treatment with
bisulfite substitution exocyclic amino group activated cytosine 
nucleus lysine residue epilson-amino group protein.
