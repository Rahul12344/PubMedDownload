rationale: triggering receptor expressed myeloid cells-2 (trem-2) cell
surface receptor primarily expressed macrophages monocyte-derived cells.
trem-2 functions regulator inflammatory response, also
serves phagocytic receptor bacteria. however, role trem-2 in
sepsis remains unknown.
objectives: investigate whether trem-2 plays role sepsis.
methods: manner expression trem-2 evaluated patients sepsis
and polymicrobial septic mouse model induced cecum ligation and
puncture approach. recombinant mouse trem-2 used block effect of
trem-2. bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (bmmcs) overexpress trem-2 were
administrated septic mice various times cecum ligation and
puncture.
measurements main results: expression levels trem-2 up-regulated 
in patients sepsis septic mice. kinetics trem-2 expression in
polymicrobial sepsis comparable bacteria burden peritoneal
lavage fluid. blocking effect trem-2 resulted markedly increased
mortality bacterial burden polymicrobial sepsis. administration of
trem-2-overexpressing bmmcs significantly reduced mortality, even was
administered 4 hours initiation sepsis. however, injection of
trem-2-overexpressing bmmcs lps-challenged endotoxemia mice improve 
the survival rate. protective effect trem-2 polymicrobial sepsis was
not associated antiinflammatory properties, enhanced bacterial
clearance vivo. furthermore, administration trem-2-overexpressing bmmcs
improved organ injury.
conclusions: trem-2 plays important role host defense response to
sepsis enhancing bacterial clearance.
