modified-live, attenuated infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (ibr) hybrid virus
vaccines constructed inserting major ibrv glycoprotein giii
gene chemically synthesized deoxyribonucleotide sequences encoding bovine
growth hormone signal sequence monomeric dimeric forms foot and
mouth disease virus (fmdv) vp 1 epitope sequences. foreign dna sequences were
inserted n-terminal end ibrv giii coding sequence driven
by ibrv giii promoter. sequences encoding first 38 first 21
amino acids ibrv giii deleted hybrid viruses containing
inserts monomeric dimeric fmdv epitope sequences, respectively, to
avoid redundant signal sequences. plaque immunoassay experiments guinea pig 
and bovine anti-fmdv peptide antisera, anti-ibrv giii monoclonal
antibodies demonstrated ibrv-fmdv fusion proteins expressed in
virus-infected mdbk cells. immunoelectron microscopy analyses demonstrated that
the ibrv-fmdv fusion proteins expressed repeated structures the
surface virus particles. experiments showed recombinant ibrv-fmdv
viruses protected cattle ibrv (cooper) challenge induced anti-fmdv
peptide antibodies, thereby demonstrating fmdv epitopes expressed
in vivo.
