mutations frequently occur oral poliovirus vaccine (opv) strains upon
replication human intestine. strains occasionally revert being
neurovirulent. prolonged excretion opv, higher risk of
reversion. opv strains secreted several months humans presenting
humoral immune system deficiencies. duration excretion opv strains or
other enteroviruses individuals infected human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) unknown. investigated whether hiv infection, prevalent 
in central african republic, causes prolonged excretion enteroviruses and,
in particular, opv strains adults. studied 28 hiv-infected adults living
with children immunized opv national immunization days
(nids). blood samples collected confirm hiv status evaluate
immunodeficiency nids. stool samples enterovirus isolation were
also collected nids, two rounds immunization 2, 4
and 6 months second round immunization. poliovirus isolated
from stool sample. eight enteroviruses isolated eight adults
(maximum one strain per patient). enteroviruses frequently isolated
from severely immunodeficient patients. thus, hiv-infected adults appear
to high risk infection opv strains excretion of
enteroviruses (and thus polioviruses) seem prolonged in
hiv-infected adults.
