we investigated possible side chain/side chain interactions four potential
transmembrane proteins. basic assumptions proteins are
alpha-helical, proteins aggregate knobs-into-holes packing. 
was found four proteins assembled stereochemically
feasible bundles alpha-helices hydrophobic exteriors hydrogen
bonds side chains one alpha-helix side chains its
knobs-into-holes packed neighbors.
