ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) key enzyme mediates synthesis of
deoxyribonucleotides, dna precursors, dna synthesis every living cell.
this enzyme converts ribonucleotides deoxyribonucleotides, building blocks
for dna replication, repair. clearly, rnr enzymes contributed the
appearance genetic material exists today, essential the
evolution organisms earth. strict control rnr activity dntp 
pool sizes important, pool imbalances increase mutation rates, replication 
anomalies, genome instability. thus, rnr activity finely regulated 
allosterically transcriptional level. review examine the
distribution, evolution, genetic regulation bacterial rnrs.
moreover, enzyme considered ideal target anti-proliferative
compounds designed inhibit cell replication eukaryotic cells (cancer
cells), parasites, viruses, bacteria.
