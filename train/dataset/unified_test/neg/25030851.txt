this study sought evaluate performance t-spot.tb assay the
diagnosis active tuberculosis (tb) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
infected patients. one hundred confirmed hiv-infected patients active tb and
known t-spot.tb cd4+ t-cell counts enrolled clinical
retrospective study. found patients lower cd4+ t-cell counts (11-50 
cells/μl) lowest t-spot.tb positive rates (50%), patients higher
cd4+ t-cell counts (50-100 cells/μl) highest t-spot.tb positive rates
(75%). however, significant differences t-spot.tb
positive rates patients different cd4+ t-cell counts (< 10, 11-50, 51-100
and > 100 cells/μl) (χ(2) = 3.7747, p = 0.287). patients positive tb
culture results significantly higher t-spot.tb positive rates (78.9%) than
patients culture-negative (44.3%) (χ(2) = 12.8303, p < 0.001). other
variables, including gender, age, tb disease classification, hiv rna level, and
highly reactive antiretroviral therapy (haart), significant effects on
t-spot.tb positive rates. number spot-forming cells (sfcs) reactive with
esat-6, cfp-10 esat-6/cfp-10-specific cells detected t-spot.tb were
positively strongly related degree immunodeficiency, the
t-spot.tb positive rates less dependent level cd4+ t-cell depletion
in hiv infection active tb.
