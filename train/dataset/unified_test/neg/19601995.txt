background: genotypic algorithms used predict clinical efficacy of
lopinavir/ritonavir (lpv/r) included range mutation lists efficacy 
endpoints. normally, hiv clinical trials powered detect difference
between treatment arms 10-12% endpoint viral load suppression <50
hiv-1 rna copies/ml. titan trial evaluated lpv/r vs. darunavir/ritonavir
(drv/r) treatment-experienced patients viral load >1000 copies/ml. this
analysis aimed re-evaluate resistance algorithms lpv/r titan trial.
methods: baseline genotype data classified using seven genotypic resistance 
algorithms: international aids society usa (ias-usa) lpv mutations (current
cut-off=6), abbott 2007 mutation list (cut-off=3), anrs mutations (cut-off=4),
fda mutations (cut-off=3), stanford, rega ias-usa major protease inhibitor
(pi) mutations. efficacy titan trial (hiv-1 rna <50 copies/ml week 48) 
was correlated number mutations list, show 'efficacy
advantage cut-off level': number mutations list associated 
a difference efficacy treatment arms least 12%.
results: multivariate logistic regression analysis identified lower genotypic
cut-off levels previously reported least 12% lower
efficacy lpv/r vs. drv/r. efficacy advantage cut-off levels were:
ias-usa lpv mutations, cut-off=3; abbott 2007, cut-off=2; anrs lpv, cut-off=3;
fda lpv mutations, cut-off=2; major ias-usa pi mutations, cut-off=1; stanford
algorithm, cut-off=low-level lpv resistance; rega algorithm,
cut-off=intermediate-level lpv resistance. linear falls hiv-1 rna
suppression rates rising mutation counts titan, french lpv atu,
bms-045 resist trials.
conclusions: analysis identified sensitive cut-off levels lpv
genotypic algorithms, currently used.
