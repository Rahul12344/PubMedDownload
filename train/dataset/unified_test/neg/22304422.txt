background: recombinant immunoblot assay (riba) used determine the
specificity antibody hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv). riba result is
recorded positive, negative, indeterminate. interpretation and
significance riba-indeterminate reactions unclear. addressed the
clinical relevance reactions context natural history of
hcv infection prospectively followed cohort anti-hcv-positive blood
donors.
study design methods: donor demographics, exposure history, humoral and
cell-mediated immunity (cmi) compared 15 riba-indeterminate subjects,
nine chronic hcv carriers, eight spontaneously recovered subjects. serum
samples tested anti-hcv quantitative, liquid luciferase
immunoprecipitation system (lips). cmi assessed interferon-γ enzyme-linked
immunosorbent spot assay.
results: lips assay, sum antibody responses six hcv antigens
showed significant (p < 0.001) stepwise diminution progressing chronic
carriers spontaneously recovered riba-indeterminate subjects. cmi responses
in riba-indeterminate subjects similar spontaneously recovered subjects
and greater chronic carriers controls (p < 0.008). parenteral risk
factor identified 13% riba-indeterminate subjects compared 89% 
of chronic carriers 87% spontaneously recovered subjects.
riba-indeterminate donors older groups.
conclusion: cmi lips results suggest persistent riba-indeterminate
reactions represent waning anti-hcv responses persons recovered 
a remote hcv infection. cases, detectable antibody may ultimately
disappear leaving residual serologic evidence prior hcv infection, as
reported minority long-term hcv-recovered subjects.
