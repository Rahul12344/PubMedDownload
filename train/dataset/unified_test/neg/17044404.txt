viral infection poses major problem public health, horticulture, animal
husbandry, possibly causing severe health crises economic losses. viral
infections identified specific detection viral sequences many
ways. microarray approach tolerates sequence variations newly
evolved virus strains, also simultaneously diagnose many viral sequences.
many chips far designed clinical use. designed for
special purposes, typing enterovirus infection, compare fewer 30
different viral sequences. none considers primer design, increasing the
likelihood cross hybridization similar sequences viruses. to
prevent possibility, work establishes platform database that
provides users specific probes known viral genome sequences to
facilitate design diagnostic chips. work develops system for
designing probes online. user select number different viruses and
set experimental conditions melting temperature length probe. 
the system returns optimal sequences database. also
developed heuristic algorithm calculate probe correctness show the
correctness algorithm. (the system supports probe design for
identifying viruses published web page
