objective: membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (mt1-mmp) expressed
prominently rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (rasfs), the
specific contribution mt1-mmp fibroblast-mediated destruction articular 
cartilage incompletely understood. study used gene transfer an
antisense expression construct assess effects mt1-mmp inhibition the
invasiveness rasfs.
methods: retroviral gene transfer plxin vector-based antisense rna
expression construct (mt1-mmpalphas) mt1-mmp used stably transduce
rasfs. levels mt1-mmp rna protein determined quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunocytochemistry in
mt1-mmpalphas-transduced rasfs well control cells, monitoring for
60 days. effects mt1-mmpalphas invasiveness rasfs analyzed 
in scid mouse co-implantation model ra.
results: mt1-mmpalphas-transduced rasfs produced high levels antisense rna
that exceeded endogenous levels mt1-mmp messenger rna 15-fold resulted 
in down-regulation mt1-mmp protein level. inhibition mt1-mmp
production maintained 60 days significantly reduced invasiveness 
of rasfs scid mouse model. whereas prominent invasion cartilage by
non-transduced mock-transduced rasfs observed (mean invasion scores 3.0
and 3.1, respectively), mt1-mmpalphas-transduced cells showed moderate
invasiveness (mean invasion score 1.8; p < 0.05).
conclusion: data demonstrate antisense rna expression construct
against mt1-mmp generated expressed rasfs least 60 days.
inhibition mt1-mmp significantly reduces cartilage degradation rasfs.
