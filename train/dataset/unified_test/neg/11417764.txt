the drug resistance profile treatment-naive hiv-infected individuals living in
buenos aires, argentina, studied. samples taken 94 drug-naive
individuals established hiv infection 13 patients primary hiv
infection assessed nucleotide sequencing lipa. prevalence of
drug-associated primary mutations individuals established infection was
very low. viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried d30n 
mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) m41l mutation reverse transcriptase 
(rt) region. secondary mutations protease rt regions found
in almost 90% individuals. individuals primary infection, primary 
mutations detected 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one carrying m461
mutation protease patient mutation codon 184 of
the rt. accordance current drug resistance testing guidelines, the
results study suggest susceptibility tests need performed 
this time prior initiation antiretroviral therapy hiv-1-infected people 
in argentina. however, public health implications subject warrant
follow-up studies examine larger number drug-naive patients, not
only buenos aires also major argentinian cities rural
areas.
