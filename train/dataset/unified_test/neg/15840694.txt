human t-cell leukemia virus type (htlv-i) causative agent neoplastic
disease, adult t-cell leukemia (atl). although encoding viral proteins play
an important role oncogenesis, role htlv-i proviral integration
site remains unsolved. determined integration sites htlv-i proviruses
in atl cells htlv-i-infected cells asymptomatic carriers. carrier and
atl cells, htlv-i provirus integrated transcriptional unit at
frequencies 26.8% (15/56) 33.9% (20/59), respectively, were
equivalent frequency calculated based random integration (33.2%). in
addition, htlv-i provirus prone integration near transcriptional start
sites leukemic cells (p = .006), transcriptional direction the
provirus accordance integrated cellular genes 70% of
cases. importantly, integration sites carrier cells favored the
alphoid repetitive sequences (11/56; 20%) whereas leukemic cells they
disfavored sequences (2/59; 3.4%). taken together, natural course
from carrier onset atl, htlv-i-infected cells integration sites
favorable viral gene transcription susceptible malignant
transformation due increased viral gene expression.
