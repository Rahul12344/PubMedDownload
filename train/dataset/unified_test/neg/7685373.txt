genomic length cdnas papaya mosaic virus (pmv) rna generated utilizing
reverse transcriptase (rnase h-) first strand synthesis, sequenase second
strand synthesis primers specific 5' 3' termini viral
genome. cdnas cloned plasmid puc18 infectious rna transcripts
were synthesized vitro bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase promoter
incorporated 5' specific primer. infectivity transcripts 16% 
that native pmv rna. increasing poly(a) tail length a24 a71
produced 43% increase infectivity. transcripts synthesized without
an m7gpppg cap structure biologically active although uncapped transcripts
were much less infectious. addition 2434 non-viral nucleotides at
the 3' end transcripts decreased abolish infectivity. insertions
of two amino acid residues within polymerase coding region inactivated viral 
transcripts. single amino acid deletion within capsid protein (cp) produced
local lesions reduced size compared native pmv rna. viral particles
could observed crude extracts lesions produced deletion
mutant suggesting exists naked rna species within host.
mutations cp suggest required viral assembly but
also unidentified function(s) replication cycle.
