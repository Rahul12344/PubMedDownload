background: kaposi's sarcoma (ks)-associated herpesvirus (kshv) newly
discovered virus found forms ks. united states, kshv infection
appears common amongst individuals high-risk ks. preliminary
data africa suggest kshv infection may much common the
general population.
objective: examine kshv seroprevalence age-specific patterns of
infection african country high rates ks.
design: cross-sectional seroprevalence study.
methods: sera taken hospital-based hiv seroprevalence study conducted 
in august 1985 lusaka, zambia time hiv becoming epidemic in
this area. total 251 sera randomly sampled examined antibodies 
against latent lytic antigens kshv. kshv seroprevalence compared 
demographic clinical variables using chi2 test linear trend odds
ratios 95% confidence intervals.
results: overall, 58% persons aged 14-84 years kshv-seropositive. kshv
seroprevalence increased linearly age (p = 0.04) inversely related
to years education (p = 0.015). contrast, hiv infection peaked those
aged 20-29 years positively related years education (p = 0.01 5).
no association kshv gender, marital status, hiv serostatus was
seen.
conclusions: kshv infection significantly common region of
zambia 1985 currently united states. data consistent
with kshv well-established region prior 1985 continued 
adult transmission virus occurring. high seroprevalence the
adolescent age-group relatively linear increase prevalence age
suggest non-sexual modes transmission may important kshv
transmission africa.
