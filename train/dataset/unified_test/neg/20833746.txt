triggering propagating intracellular innate immune response essential
for control viral infections. rnase l host endoribonuclease pivotal
component innate immunity cleaves viral cellular rna within
single-stranded loops releasing small structured rnas 5'-hydroxyl (5'-oh)
and 3'-monophosphoryl (3'-p) groups. 2007, reported rnase l cleaves
self rna produce small rnas function pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (pamps). however, precise sequence structure pamp rnas
produced rnase l unknown. used hepatitis c virus rna substrate
to characterize rnase l mediated cleavage products [named suppressor virus rna
(svrna)] ability activate rig-i like receptors (rlr). ns5b
region hcv rna cleaved rnase l release svrna bound rig-i,
displacing repressor domain stimulating atpase activity while
signaling ifn-β gene intact cells. three rig-i functions
were dependent presence svrna 3'-p. furthermore, svrna
suppressed hcv replication vitro mechanism involving ifn production 
and triggered rig-i-dependent hepatic innate immune response mice. rnase l
and oas (required activation) expressed hepatocytes from
hcv-infected patients, raising possibility oas/rnase l pathway might
suppress hcv replication vivo. proposed rnase l mediated cleavage
of hcv rna generates svrna activates rig-i, thus propagating innate immune
signaling ifn-β gene.
