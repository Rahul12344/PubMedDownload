bacteriophage lambda bombarded low-energy ar+ ions goal of
determining whether particular regions dna genome found preferentially
in outer portion packaged dna mass. strategy fragment the
dna selectively near surface virus exposing intact phage ar+
ions energetic enough break covalent chemical bonds dna energetic
enough penetrate deeply beneath viral capsid shell. broken dna then
isolated, genomic origin identified southern hybridization to
mapped restriction fragments lambda dna. analysis southern blots
revealed regions lambda genome represented among small
dna fragments generated times ar+ bombardment examined. depending
on duration exposure, however, particular regions genome found
to enriched small-fragment population. short periods exposure,
sequences leftmost 10% right half standard genetic
map enriched broken-dna fraction. among sequences right half
of genome, enrichment progressively pronounced beginning 
middle genetic map proceeding toward right end. phage bombarded
for longer periods time, rightward sequences preferentially depleted in
the small-fragment population. contrast, ar+ bombardment carried 
with free lambda dna rather intact phage, small dna fragments arose
uniformly regions genome times exposure examined. the
results indicate intact phage, dna sequences right half 
from leftmost regions genome tendency lie closer the
capsid remainder genome. since dna packaged the
prohead beginning left end, results suggest packaging occurs in
such way newly entering dna tends disposed externally that
packaged earlier times.
