micrornas (mirnas) key regulators gene expression modulators of
diverse biological pathways. analyses mirna function well therapeutic
managing mirnas rely cellular administration mirna inhibitors may 
be achieved use viral vehicles. study explores the
mirna-suppressive capacity inhibitors expressed intracellularly from
lentivirus-derived gene vectors. superior activity two decoy-type inhibitors, 
a "bulged sponge" eight mirna recognition sites hairpin-shaped "tough 
decoy" containing two mirna recognition sites, demonstrated side-by-side 
comparison seven types mirna inhibitors transcribed short rnas an
rna pol iii promoter. find lentiviral vectors expressing tough decoy
inhibitors less vulnerable bulged sponge-encoding vectors targeting
by cognate mirna less prone, therefore, reductions transfer
efficiency. importantly, demonstrated tough decoy inhibitors retain
their mirna suppression capacity context longer rna transcripts
expressed rna pol ii promoter. rna pol ii-transcribed tough decoy
inhibitors new tools managing mirnas may potential for
temporal spatial regulation mirna activity well therapeutic
targeting mirnas aberrantly expressed human disease.
