the nucleotide sequence 3'-terminal portion tobacco etch virus
(tev) genome determined. 2324-nucleotide sequence represented
approximately one-fourth tev genome included capsid protein gene
and flanking regions. open reading frame 2135 nucleotides an
untranslated region 189 nucleotides adjacent polyadenylate tract were
identified. sequence began within open reading frame, indicating 
initiation codon upstream available sequence data. sequence the
20 nh(2)-terminal amino acids tev capsid protein established
chemically. identical amino acid sequence, predicted nucleotide
sequence, located, commencing amino acid - 263. data indicated 
maturation capsid protein required post-translational cleavage a
larger protein precursor, probable cleavage site amino acids
glutamine glycine.
