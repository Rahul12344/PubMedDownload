group c orthobunyaviruses (family bunyaviridae, genus orthobunyavirus),
discovered 1950s, vector-borne human pathogens americas.
currently gap genomic information group c viruses. this
study, obtained complete coding region sequences reference strains of
caraparu (carv), oriboca (oriv), marituba (mtbv) madrid (madv) viruses, and
five clinical isolates peru bolivia, using unbiased de novo approach 
consisting random reverse transcription, random anchored pcr amplification,
and high throughput pyrosequencing. small, medium, large segments encode 
for 235 amino acid nucleocapsid protein, approximately 1430 amino acid
surface glycoprotein polyprotein precursor, 2248 amino acid rna-dependent
rna polymerase, respectively. additionally, segment encodes 83 amino
acid non-structural protein, although protein truncated silenced in
some isolates. phylogenetically, three clinical isolates clustered carv, one
clustered mtbv, one isolate appeared reassortant genetic
drift resulted high variability medium segment also
seen orthobunyaviruses. data represent first complete
coding region sequences serocomplex pathogenic orthobunyaviruses. the
genome-wide phylogeny reference strains consistent antigenic
properties viruses reported original serological studies conducted 
in 1960s. comparative analysis conserved protein regions across group c
virus strains orthobunyavirus groups revealed group c
viruses contain characteristic domains potential structural functional
significance. results provide basis developments diagnostics, 
further genetic analyses, future epidemiologic studies group c viruses.
