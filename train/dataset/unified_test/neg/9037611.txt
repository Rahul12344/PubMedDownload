the functional properties 125i-labeled antibodies antigens adsorbed on
polystyrene silicone compared counterparts immobilized by
non-adsorptive methods. less 20% polyclonal (pab) 1-2% monoclonal 
(mab) capture antibody equivalents remained functional adsorption a
monolayer. survivability circa doubled totally rescued, same
antibodies immobilized via streptavidin bridge using first stage
polyclonal antiglobulin capture antibody, respectively. similarly, the
antigenicity bovine iggs pab mab anti-iggs highest iggs
were immobilized via streptavidin bridge secondarily adsorbed an
albumin monolayer. iggs configurations significantly antigenic

these iggs equally antigenic denatured subsequently adsorbed 6m

most likely occur. especially case latter, functional

relevant use silicone medical prostheses. antigenicity iggs
adsorbed silicone multilayer (secondary layer) much higher when
directly adsorbed. since surfaces would exposed high protein
concentrations vivo, multilayers monolayer, would expected. thus it
would seem studies host protein adsorbed silicone would be
expressed immune system surface multilayers. the
case, seems unlikely adsorption host protein vivo would
generate new epitopes host's immune system could respond and
subsequently initiate autoimmune syndrome.
