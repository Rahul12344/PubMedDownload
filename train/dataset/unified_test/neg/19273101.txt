induction appropriate types innate adaptive immune responses depending 
on nature antigens crucial cope variety pathogens and
concurrently avoid pathological reaction self antigens. recent studies have
been elucidating diversity immune responses critically controlled 
by dendritic cells (dcs). two dc subsets identified humans: myeloid 
dcs (mdcs) plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs). dc subsets recognize different
microbial pathogens expressing distinct repertoires toll-like receptors,
and induce different types innate adaptive immune responses depending on
environmental factors. particularly, pdc precursors produce vast amounts type 
i interferons response viruses thus play important role in
anti-viral immunity. addition, type interferons derived pdcs are
instrumental activating mdcs. elucidating cellular molecular mechanisms by
which functions two dc subsets modulated lead understanding
the pathogenesis various immune-related diseases developing novel
immunological therapies.
