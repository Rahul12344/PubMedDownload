the molecular mechanisms responsible long-distance, directional spread of
alphaherpesvirus infections via axons infected neurons poorly understood. 
we describe use red green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusions capsid 
and tegument components, respectively, visualize purified, single
extracellular virions axonal assemblies pseudorabies virus (prv)
infection cultured neurons. observed heterogeneity gfp fluorescence when
gfp fused tegument component vp22 single extracellular virions
and discrete puncta infected axons. heterogeneity observed the
presence absence capsid structure detected fusion monomeric red
fluorescent protein vp26. similarity heterogeneous distribution 
these fluorescent protein fusions purified virions axons suggested
that tegument-capsid assembly axonal targeting viral components are
linked. one possibility assembly extracellular axonal
particles containing dually fluorescent fusion proteins occurred 
process cell body. tested hypothesis treating infected cultured
neurons brefeldin a, potent inhibitor herpesvirus maturation and
secretion. brefeldin treatment disrupted neuronal secretory pathway,
affected fluorescent capsid tegument transport cell body, blocked 
subsequent entry axons capsid tegument proteins. electron microscopy 
demonstrated absence brefeldin treatment, enveloped capsids
entered axons, presence inhibitor, unenveloped capsids
accumulated cell body. results support assembly process 
prv capsids acquire membrane cell body prior axonal entry and
subsequent transport.
