in vitro vivo studies done herpes simplex virus type 2 strain
recovered patient acyclovir (acv) acv resistant expressed
thymidine (dthd) kinase (ec 2.7.1.21) activity. plaque-purified clones derived
from original clinical sample heterogeneous respect plaque size 
and drug susceptibility. heterogeneity viral mixture also evident
from varied 125i-labeled 5-iodo-2'-deoxycytidine autoradiographic patterns and
from varied expression dthd kinase-associated phosphorylating activities. four
clones mixture 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylthymine (ara-t)
