the n-terminal domain retroviral capsid (ca) protein one least
conserved regions encoded genome. surprisingly, three-dimensional
structures ca different genera exhibit alpha-helical structural
features highly conserved. n-terminal residues human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rous sarcoma virus (rsv) capsid
proteins form beta-hairpin. determine feature conserved the
retroviral family, cloned, expressed, purified, solved structure 
n-terminal 134 amino acid fragment (ca(134)) human t-cell leukemia virus
type 1 (htlv-i) using high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)
spectroscopy. ca(134) fragment contains n-terminal beta-hairpin a
central coiled-coil-like structure composed six alpha-helices. n-terminal 
pro1 residue contacts asp54 helical cluster salt bridge. thus,
the beta-hairpin conserved helical cluster structurally similar 
other retroviral ca domains. however, although asp residue defines the
orientation hairpin htlv-1 hiv-1 ca proteins, htlv-i
hairpin oriented away, rather towards, helical core. significant
differences also detected spatial orientation helical content 
the long centrally located loop connecting helices core. been
proposed salt bridge allows formation ca-ca interface is
important assembly conical cores characteristic hiv-1.
as htlv-i forms spherical cores, salt-bridge feature apparently not
conserved function although role determining orientation of
the beta-hairpin may critical, along central loop. comparison of
three-dimensional structures expected elucidate relationships between
the retroviral capsid protein structure function.
