we describe method situ sizing individual huge dna molecules laser
trapping. single dna molecules reversibly transformed, without mechanical
fragmentation fragile huge-sized dna, random coil state 
globular state induced condensing agents poly(ethylene glycol) mg(2+).
with use globular dna molecule folded condensation, critical
velocity circularly accelerated single globular dna molecule laser
trapping found proportional size dna. yeast,
saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromosome iii (285 kbp) successfully sized (281
+/- 40 kbp) calibration curve scaled using lambda, t4, yeast
chromosome vi (48.5, 166, 385 kbp, respectively). use critical
velocity sizing parameter makes possible size single dna molecules
without prior conformational information, i.e., radius single globular
huge dna molecule nanoparticle. sized single globular dna molecule could
be trapped subsequent manipulation, transportation it
anywhere. also investigated possibility reusing globular dna
molecules condensed peg mg(2+) pcr found pcr efficiency was
not deteriorated presence condensation agents.
