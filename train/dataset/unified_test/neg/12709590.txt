heme oxygenase (ho) catalyzes conversion heme biliverdin the
release iron carbon monoxide. ho-1 inducible inflammatory
conditions, cause oxidative stress endothelial cells. overexpression 
human ho-1 endothelial cells may potential provide protection
against variety agents cause oxidative stress. investigated the
physiological significance human ho-1 overexpression using retroviral vector
on attenuation angiotensin ii (ang ii)-mediated oxidative stress. comet and
glutathione (gsh) levels used indicators levels oxidative
stress. comet assay performed evaluate damage dna, whereas gsh levels
were measured determine unbalance redox potential. pretreatments with
inducers, heme 10 microm, sncl(2) 10 microm, inhibitors, as
tin-mesoporphyrin 10 microm followed treatment ang ii 200 ng/ml.
pretreatment heme sncl(2) provoked significant reductions (p < 0.01) of
tail moment comet assay. opposite effects evident pretreatment for
16 hr tin-mesoporphyrin. decrease tail moment levels found human
endothelial cells transduced human ho-1 gene. addition ang ii
(200 ng/ml) human dermal microvessel endothelial cell-1 16 hr resulted 
a significant (p < 0.05) reduction gsh contents control endothelial cells 
not endothelial cells transduced ho-1 gene. results presented
indicated stimulation overexpression ho-1 attenuated dna damages
caused exposures ang ii.
