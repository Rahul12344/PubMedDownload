m13 recombinant dna clones containing 350-base sequence derived ecori 
fragment two tandemly linked rous-associated virus 2 (rav-2) long terminal
repeat (ltr) sequences used map reverse transcriptase-associated
endonuclease (rt-endonuclease) cleavage sites primer extension studies. 
appropriate conditions, alpha beta form rt-endonuclease (composed 
the alpha beta subunits) purified avian sarcoma virus (pr-c b-77
strains) introduces specific break inverted complementary repeat
sequence found junction ltrs. cleavage sites occur 
nucleotide sequence (-) (+) dna strands; together potential 
of generating 6-base-pair staggered overlap spans junction. this
supports notion enzyme involved viral dna integration. other
rt-endonuclease sites analyzed. second site, occurs lac
region m13 vector dna upstream unique ecori cloning site, bears
no apparent sequence homology site junction ltrs. however,
it also lies within inverted complementary repeat and, case 
site ltr, break occurs 5' side axis symmetry.
cleavage second site suppressed vector contains rav-2 ltr
insert. thus, viral ltr appears exert cis effect influence a
region 300 base pairs away.
