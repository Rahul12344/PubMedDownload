chandipura virus, member rhabdoviridae family vesiculovirus genera, 
has recently emerged human pathogen associated number of
outbreaks different parts india. although, virus closely resembles with
the prototype vesiculovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, could readily
distinguished ability infect humans. studies chandipura virus 
shed light distinct stages viral infection; may also allow us to
identify potential drug targets antiviral therapy. review, have
summarized current understanding chandipura virus life cycle the
molecular detail particular interest viral rna metabolisms, namely
transcription, replication packaging viral rna nucleocapsid
structure. contemporary research otherwise extensively studied family member
vesicular stomatitis virus also addressed present more
comprehensive picture vesiculovirus life cycle. finally, reveal examples of
protein economy chandipura virus life-cycle whereby viral protein has
evolved complexity perform multiple tasks.
