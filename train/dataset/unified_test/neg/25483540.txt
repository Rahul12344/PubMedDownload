influenza vaccination aims reducing incidence serious disease,
complications death among risk severe influenza
disease. influenza vaccine effectiveness (ve) sentinel surveillance data 
from pidirac program (daily acute respiratory infection surveillance of
catalonia) 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013 influenza seasons, with
three different predominant circulating influenza virus (iv) types [a(h1n1)pdm09,
a(h3n2) b, respectively] assessed. total number sentinel samples
with known vaccination background collected study period 3173,
14.7% received corresponding seasonal influenza vaccine. 1117
samples (35.2%) positive iv. retrospective negative case control
design used assess vaccine effectiveness (ve) entire period and
for epidemic influenza season. overall 58.1% (95% ci:46.8-67) was
obtained. differences according epidemic season observed, being
highest 2012-2013 season predominance iv type b (69.7% ;95%
ci:51.5-81) 2010-2011 season, predominance a(h1n1)pdm09
influenza virus strain (67.2% ;95%ci:49.5-78.8) lowest 2011-2012
season a(h3n2) subtype predominance (34.2% ;95%ci:4.5-54.6). influenza
vaccination prevents substantial number influenza-associated illnesses.
although vaccines increased effectiveness needed search a
universal vaccine subject genetic modifications might increase ve,
nowadays efforts increase vaccination rates high-risk population
and healthcare personnel let reduce burden influenza its
complications.
