we previously demonstrated actinomycin (actd) enhanced hiv-1 replication
in mt-2 cell, human t-cell leukemia virus type-1-infected cell line. the
mt-2 cell known produce multiple cytokines spontaneously. study, we
investigated impact actd cytokine production mt-2 cells and
hiv-1 replication latently infected cell line, u1. mt-2 cells were
pulse-treated 0 200 nm actd, culture supernatants collected 3
days incubation. supernatants untreated cells (sup0) induced hiv-1
replication 150-fold u1 cells. culture supernatants actd-treated cells
(sup200) enhanced hiv-1 replication 1200-fold. combination sequential
chromatographic approach mass spectrometric analysis identified the
hiv-inducing factors sup200 interleukin (il)-6 tumor necrosis factor 
(tnf)-beta. quantitative analysis revealed actd treatment increased the
concentration il-6 sup200 600% compared sup0 decreased 
the amount tnfbeta sup200 85%. northern blot analysis showed actd
treatment increased il-6 transcripts; however, change seen tnfbeta
transcripts. results suggest actd induces replication hiv-1 through
modulation cytokine production.
