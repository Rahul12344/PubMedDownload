for decades, cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive (ca/ts) strains influenza a
virus used live attenuated vaccines. due great public
health importance crucial understand molecular mechanism(s) cold 
adaptation temperature sensitivity currently unknown. instance, 
secondary rna structures play important roles influenza biology. thus, we
hypothesized relatively minor change temperature (32-39°c) lead 
perturbations influenza rna structures and, structural
perturbations may different mrnas wild type (wt) ca/ts strains.
to test hypothesis, developed novel silico method enables
assessing whether two related rna molecules would undergo (dis)similar structural
perturbations upon temperature change. proposed method allows identifying
those areas within rna chain dissimilarities rna secondary structures
at two different temperatures particularly pronounced, without knowing
particular rna shapes either temperature. identified areas ns2,
pa, pb2 np mrnas. however, areas identical wt ca/ts
mutants. differences temperature-induced structural changes wt ca/ts
mrna structures may constitute yet unappreciated molecular mechanism the
cold adaptation/temperature sensitivity phenomena.
