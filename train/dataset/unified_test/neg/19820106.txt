background: mortality hiv-infected patients declined substantially with
combination antiretroviral therapy (art), unclear whether has
reached general population. compared mortality patients
starting art nine countries europe north america corresponding
general population, taking account response art.
methods: eligible patients enrolled prospective cohort studies
participating art cohort collaboration. calculated ratio of
observed expected deaths causes [standardized mortality ratio (smr)],
measuring time 6 months starting art, according risk group,
clinical stage start art cd4 cell count viral load 6 months.
expected numbers deaths obtained age-, sex- country-specific
mortality rates.
results: among 29 935 eligible patients, 1134 deaths recorded 131 510
person-years follow-up. median age 37 years, 8162 (27%) patients 
females, 4400 (15%) injecting drug users (idus) 6738 (23%) aids when
starting art. 6 months, 23 539 patients (79%) viral load measurements
<or=500 copies/ml. lowest smr, 1.05 [95% confidence interval (ci) 0.82-1.35] 
was found men sex men (msm) started art free aids,
reached cd4 cell count >or=350 cells/microl suppressed viral replication
to <or=500 copies/ml sixth month. contrast, smr 73.7 (95% ci
46.4-116.9) idus failed suppress viral replication cd4 cell
counts <50 cells/microl 6 months. percentage patients smrs <2 
46% msm, 42% heterosexually infected patients 0% patients 
history injection drug use. corresponding percentages smrs >10 4, 14 
and 47%.
conclusions: industrialized countries, mortality experience of
hiv-infected patients start art survive first 6 months continues to
be higher general population, many patients excess mortality 
is moderate comparable patients chronic conditions. much of
the excess mortality might prevented earlier diagnosis hiv followed by
timely initiation art.
