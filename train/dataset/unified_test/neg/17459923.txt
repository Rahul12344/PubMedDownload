astrocytes first cells infected murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) in
primary cultures brain. cells play key roles intercellular signaling 
and neuronal development, modulate synaptic activity within nervous 
system. using ratiometric fura-2 digital calcium imaging >8,000 neurons and
glia, found mcmv-infected astrocytes showed increase intracellular 
basal calcium levels enhanced response neuroactive substances,
including glutamate atp, high potassium levels. cultured neurons 
no sign mcmv infection showed attenuated synaptic signaling infection of
the underlying astrocyte substrate, intercellular communication between
astrocytes sign infection reduced presence infected
glia. bystander effects would tend cause deterioration of
cellular communication brain addition problems caused the
loss directly infected cells.
