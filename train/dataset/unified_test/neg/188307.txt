changes activities three enzymes involved nucleotide metabolism were
studied following infection vero cells sv40. results showed sv40
infection enhanced activities uridine phosphokinase ump phosphokinase 
involved nucleotide synthesis suppressed activity nucleoside
triphosphatases involved nulceotide degradation. sv40-induced enzyme
activity changes probably served somehow increase quantity nucleotides 
for virus proliferation.
