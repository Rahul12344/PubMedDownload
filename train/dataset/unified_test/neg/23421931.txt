secondary infections streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) frequently observed
following influenza virus (iav) infection substantial impact on
global health. despite this, basis disease progression is
incompletely understood. investigate effect co-infection human
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mddcs) analysed expression clinically
important pro-inflammatory immune-modulatory cytokines. iav infection or
treatment supernatants iav-infected cell cultures resulted priming
of dcs subsequently influenced production il-12p70, well as
il-6, following sp infection. co-infection cell required 
this effect dependent time, dose duration infections, as
well pathogen viability, bacterial uptake endosome acidification.
bacterially infected cells characterized main producers il-12p70. 
finally, showed type interferons primarily responsible the
priming il-12p70 observed infection iav. results
provide probable mechanism elevated levels particular cytokines
observed iav sp co-infected cell cultures implications the
pathogenic outcome observed vivo infection.
