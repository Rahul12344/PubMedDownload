apobec3g (a3g) host cytidine deaminase that, absence vif,
restricts hiv-1 replication reduces amount viral dna accumulates 
in cells. initial studies determined a3g induces extensive mutation of
nascent hiv-1 cdna reverse transcription. proposed this
triggers degradation viral dna, mounting evidence
that mechanism may correct. here, use natural endogenous reverse
transcriptase assay show that, cell-free virus particles, a3g able to
inhibit hiv-1 cdna accumulation absence hypermutation also
without apparent need target cell factors. find although
reverse transcription initiates presence a3g, elongation cdna
product impeded. data support model a3g reduces hiv-1 cdna
levels inhibiting synthesis rather inducing degradation.
