bacteriophage r17 investigated means technique of
high-resolution autoradiography. tritiated precursors ribonucleic acid (rna), 
deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), protein employed separate experiments. a
striking inhibition cellular rna, dna, protein synthesis noted.
whereas normal rna synthesis occurs nucleoid, infected cells rna
synthesis predominantly cytoplasmic, later latent period, and
during stage active viral growth, label localized polar
region. late stages viral growth, rna synthesis occurs around 
crystals. protein synthesis also becomes localized polar region, dna
synthesis remains confined nucleoid. conditions chloramphenicol
inhibition viral-coat protein synthesis, rna label localized the
paranuclear lesion, providing indication rna forms fibrillar
structure.
