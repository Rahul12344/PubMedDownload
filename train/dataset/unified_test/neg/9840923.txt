the pigment epithelium retina (rpe) derived optic cup is
essential function development eye. produced transgenic mouse
line expresses simian virus (sv40) transforming sequences control of
the 1.4 kb tyrosinase-related protein 1 (trp-1) promoter, targeting expression of
t antigen (tag) rpe. transgenic embryos, rpe cells proliferated 
anterior part eye near optic nerve. resulted formation 
tumors, pigmented epithelial origin. 3 months-old mice,
pigmented cells detected spleen inguinal lymph nodes. spleen,
tyrosinase, trp-1 sv40 tag expressed tyrosinase enzymatically
active. pigmented regions positive epithelial marker, cytokeratin.
cell lines established tumor metastases kept culture for
more 2 months. pigmented, maintained expression of
tyrosinase, trp-1, cytokeratin sv40 tag. demonstrates rpe tumor
cells metastasize lymph node spleen. conclusion, metastasis from
trp-1/tag rpe tumors towards spleen lymph nodes serves potential tool to
investigate biology metastasis tumors derived pigment epithelium.
