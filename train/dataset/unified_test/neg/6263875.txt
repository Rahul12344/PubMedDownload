carbohydrate structures hvj (sendai virus) glycoproteins.

yoshima h, nakanishi m, okada y, kobata a.

the carbohydrate structures two membrane glycoproteins (hana protein f
protein) hvj determined materials purified virions grown 
the allantoic sac embryonated chicken eggs. glycoproteins contain fucose,
mannose, galactose, glucosamine galactosamine, indicating 
sugar chains exclusively asparagine-linked type. radioactive
oligosaccharide fractions obtained two glycoproteins hydrazinolysis
followed nab[3h]4 reduction gave quite distinct fractionation patterns after
paper electrophoresis. 75% oligosaccharides f protein 
acidic separated least four components paper electrophoresis. only
18% oligosaccharide hana protein acidic single component.
these acidic oligosaccharides could converted neutral oligosaccharides 
by sialidase digestion. structural studies neutral oligosaccharide
fractions hana f proteins revealed mixtures a
series high mannose type oligosaccharides complex type oligosaccharides
with gal beta 1 leads (fuc alpha 1 leads 3) glcnac group outer
chain moieties.
