background: association profile surface gene mutations viral
genotypes studied patients chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) 
not subjects occult hbv infection.
aim: study aimed investigate association surface gene mutations
with viral genotypes occult hbv infection.
materials & methods: 293 family contacts 90 chronic hbv index patients, 110
consented study. 110 subjects, 97 hepatitis b surface antigen
(hbsag) negative. hbv genotyping done using direct dna sequencing. s-gene
was also sequenced 13 chronic hepatitis b patients serve controls.
results: twenty-eight (28.8%) 97 subjects occult hbv infection.
bidirectional sequencing partial s-gene successful 13 them. seven
(53.8%) viral sequences genotype a1, two (15.3%) genotypes
d5&d2 one (7.6%) d1&g genotypes. seven (53.8%) 13 hbsag
positive patients, genotype d&6 (46.1%) genotype a. a128v & t143m mutations
were observed 5 13 (38.4%) subjects a128v & p127s 2 13 (15.3%)
patients (p = 0.385). a128v mutation seen two (15.3%) subjects d2
genotype, t143m mutation seen three (23.07%) subjects with
a1genotype. aa125, three (23.07%) subjects d5 genotype methionine
instead threonine. wild type sequences five (38.4%) subjects,
one d1, g genotypes (20%) four a1 (80%) genotypes. none the
subjects g145r mutation.
conclusions: occult hbv infection may common household contacts chronic 
hbv infected patients. equal prevalence a&d sub-genotypes present in
occult hbv subjects chronic hbv patients. mutations s-gene are
genotype specific occult well chronic hbv infection.
