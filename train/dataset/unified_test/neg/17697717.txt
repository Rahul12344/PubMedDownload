transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
(pedv) major etiological agents diarrhea death piglets. multiplex
real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr developed simultaneous
differential quantification virus single reaction tube, using cy5-
and fam-labeled taqman-probes based sequences tgev pedv
nucleocapsid genes. copy numbers transcripts tgev pedv were
quantified using assay range 9x10(7) 9x10(1) copies and
7x10(7) 7x10(1) copies, respectively. variability intra-assay and
inter-assay evaluated using standard solutions transcript, with
coefficients variation (cv) less 3.43 3.33%, respectively. piglets
were experimentally infected virulent tgev pedv, amounts of
virus onset diarrhea measured. samples obtained farms
experiencing ped tge quantified 10(2) 10(5) rna copies. in
conclusion, assay provides effective etiological diagnostic tool for
detecting quantifying viral loads. assay may also prove useful for
detecting infections, ultimately leading better disease control farms.
