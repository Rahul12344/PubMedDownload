sex-related differences susceptibility pathogens common phenomenon in
animals. eusocial hymenoptera two female castes, workers queens,
are diploid males haploid. haploid susceptibility hypothesis predicts
that haploid males susceptible pathogen infections compared to
females. test hypothesis using adult male (drone) female
(worker) honey bees (apis mellifera), inoculated gut endoparasite nosema
ceranae and/or black queen cell virus (bqcv). pathogens chosen due 
previously reported synergistic interactions nosema apis bqcv. our
data support synergistic interactions n. ceranae bqcv also
suggest bqcv limited effect drone worker health, regardless 
of infection level. however, data clearly show that, despite lower levels
of n. ceranae spores drones workers, nosema-infected drones a
higher mortality lower body mass non-infected drones, across all
treatment groups, mortality body mass worker bees largely
unaffected n. ceranae infection, suggesting drones susceptible
to pathogen workers. conclusion, data reveal considerable
sex-specific differences pathogen susceptibility honey bees highlight
the importance ultimate measures determining susceptibility, as
mortality body quality, rather mere infection levels.
