background: bacteriophage therapy effective antimicrobial approach with
potentially important applications medicine biotechnology be
seen additional string bow. emerging drug resistant bacteria in
aquaculture industry due unrestricted use antibiotics warrants more
sustainable environmental friendly strategies controlling fish
infections.the isolated bacteria fish lesions characterised based on
isolation selective differential medium like pseudomonas agar, gram
staining, biochemical tests 16srrna sequencing. metallo-beta-lactamase
(mbl) producing bacterial isolate evaluated using imipenem -
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) disk method. specific bacteriophage
was isolated concentrated using coal bed developed lab csir-neeri. 
the isolated enriched bacteriophage characterised nucleotide
sequencing electron microscopy. phage therapy applied treating
ulcerative lesion fish.
results: pathogenic bacterium responsible causing ulcerative lesions in
catfish species (clarias gariepinus) identified pseudomonas aeruginosa.
one twenty p. aeruginosa isolate showing multi drug resistance (mdr) was
incidentally found mbl producing determined imipenem-edta disk
method. phage therapy effectively cured ulcerative lesions the
infected fish 8-10 days treatment, sevenfold reduction lesion
with untreated infection control.
conclusion: bacteriophage therapy potential applications soon an
alternative complement antibiotic treatment aquaculture. we
present bacteriophage therapy treatment method controlling mdr p.
aeruginosa infection c. gariepinus. best knowledge a
first report application phage therapy mbl producing p. aeruginosa 
isolated aquatic ecosystem.
