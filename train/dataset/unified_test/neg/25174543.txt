background: role human papillomavirus (hpv) carcinogenesis continues
to rise, role genetic factors modify risk become
increasingly important. study, reviewed literature for
associations polymorphisms hpv carcinogenesis.
objective: identify associations genetic polymorphisms oncogenic
hpv carcinogenesis evaluate methodology used.
study design: systematic literature review hpv, genetic polymorphisms, and
cancer risk. odds ratios (or), interaction terms, p-values tabulated.
meta-analyses measures heterogeneity estimated using revman 5.1.
results: cervix frequently studied cancer site followed the
head neck. overall risk cancer (cancer vs. control) common
comparison, whereas reports initiation (pre-cancer vs. control) and
progression (cancer vs. pre-cancer) rare. case-series joint-effect of
hpv genotype risk evaluated frequently, independent effect 
either risk factor alone rarely provided. p53-arg72pro commonly 
studied polymorphism studied. consistent interaction detected by
meta-analysis hpv(+) [or 0.98 (0.55-1.76)] hpv(-) [or 1.10
(0.76-1.60)] subsets head neck cancer risk. polymorphisms genes known
to encode proteins physically interact hpv infrequently studied.
conclusion: consistent polymorphism-hpv interactions observed. study
design, choice candidate polymorphisms/genes, focus overall risk
rather specific portions carcinogenic pathway may have
contributed lack significant findings.
