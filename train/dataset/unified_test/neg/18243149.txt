in philippines, insufficient consideration given the
implementation systematic control measures major abortifacient
infectious agents livestock. elucidate epidemiology abortifacient
infectious agents livestock, prevalence four abortifacient agents was
assessed. initially, total 96 cattle including 17 cows history of
abortion examined herd luzon request farm owner. six
(35.3%) 17 aborting cows found serologically positive for
neospora caninum (n. caninum), whereas seroprevalence non-aborting cows
was 15.9% (10/63). four 6 serologically positive aborting cows also
rt-pcr-positive bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv). two (12.5%) 16
bulls examined also found infected bvdv, suggesting putative
risk factor transmission via semen. based sequence analysis, isolates
detected belong bvdv type 1b group. furthermore, epidemiological survey 
abortifacient infectious agents conducted various species livestock
from herds located luzon. 105 water buffalo samples collected, 4
(3.8%) indicated positive n. caninum, 2 (1.9%) toxoplasma gondii (t.
gondii) 2 (1.9%) trypanosoma evansi (t. evansi). overall
seroprevalence n. caninum goat sheep 23.6% (21/89) 26.3%
(10/38), respectively. bvdv detected herds. findings this
exploratory study indicate relationship infection bovine abortion
and lager study required statistically confirm relationship.
