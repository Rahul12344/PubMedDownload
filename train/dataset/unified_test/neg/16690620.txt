alpha(v)beta8 integrin expression restricted primarily kidney, brain, and
placenta. targeted alpha(v) beta8 deletion embryonic lethal due to
defective placenta brain angiogenesis, precluding investigation kidney
alpha(v)beta8 function. find kidney beta8 localized glomerular
mesangial cells, expression decreased mouse models of
glomerulosclerosis, suggesting beta8 regulates normal mesangial cell
differentiation. interrogate beta8 signaling pathways, yeast two-hybrid and
co-precipitation studies demonstrated beta8 interaction rho guanine
nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-1 (gdi). selective beta8 stimulation enhanced
beta8-gdi interaction well rac1 (but rhoa) activation lamellipodia 
formation. mesangial cells itgb8-/- mice backcrossed genetic background
that permitted survival, gdi-/- mice, develop glomerulosclerosis,
demonstrated rhoa (but rac1) activity alpha-smooth muscle actin assembly,
which characterizes mesangial cell myofibroblast transformation renal disease.
to determine whether rac1 directly modulates rhoa-associated myofibroblast
differentiation, mesangial cells transduced inhibitory rac peptide
fused human immunodeficiency virus-tat, resulting enhanced alpha-smooth
muscle actin organization. conclude beta8 cytosolic tail mesangial
cells organizes signaling complex culminates rac1 activation mediate
wild-type differentiation, whereas decreased beta8 activation shifts mesangial
cells toward rhoa-dependent myofibroblast phenotype.
