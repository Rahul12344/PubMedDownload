the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) s1 subunit spike
(s) glycoprotein mediates viral attachment host cells s2 subunit is
responsible membrane fusion. using ibv arkansas-type (ark) protein
histochemistry, show extension s1 s2 ectodomain improves
binding chicken tissues. although s1 subunit major inducer of
neutralizing antibodies, vaccination s1 protein shown confer
inadequate protection challenge. demonstrated contribution s2
ectodomain binding chicken tissues suggests vaccination the
ectodomain might improve protection compared vaccination s1 alone.
therefore, immunized chickens recombinant trimeric soluble ibv ark-type
s1 s-ectodomain protein produced codon-optimized constructs mammalian 
cells. chickens primed 12days age water-in-oil emulsified s1 or
s-ectodomain proteins, boosted 21days later. challenge performed
with virulent ark ibv 21days boost. chickens immunized recombinant
s-ectodomain protein showed statistically significantly (p<0.05) reduced viral
loads 5days post-challenge tears tracheas compared chickens
immunized recombinant s1 protein. consistent viral loads, significantly
reduced (p<0.05) tracheal mucosal thickness tracheal lesion scores revealed
that recombinant s-ectodomain protein provided improved protection tracheal
integrity compared s1 protein. results indicate s2 domain has
an important role inducing protective immunity. thus, including s2 domain 
with s1 might promising better viral vectored and/or subunit vaccine
strategies.
