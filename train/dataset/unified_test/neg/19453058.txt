background/aims: re-infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) important for
prognosis liver transplantation hcv cirrhosis. mechanism of
re-infection hcv, peri-transplant immunity including immunosuppression
must important getting solution prevention infection.
(please rewrite phrase). study, investigated influences of
intraportal dst hcv-reinfection living related liver transplantation
(lrlt).
methodology: 12 patients, underwent lrlt end-stage hcv liver
cirrhosis 1999 2007 hospital, estimated influence
of intraportal dst re-infection hcv. nine persons patients 
received intraportal dst lrlt.
results: nine patients could steroid withdrawn within 2 months. the
seven persons patients received intraportal dst treated with
perioperative ifn therapy. two patients preoperative interferon-beta therapy.
the one patient could obtain svr. patient dropped the
complications. four patients interferon-beta therapy acute
hepatitis phase. two patients chronic hepatitis phase. one
patient mentioned before, preoperative ifn-beta dropped out. hcv the
one patients without interferon therapy disappeared spontaneously 3 months. 
the hcv disappeared 6 patients (66.7%) nine patients with
intraportal dst lrlt. five six patients svr. patient who
got preoperative ifn-beta revealed macrochimerism donor type cd56+t cell
in graft liver one month lrlt. immunological analysis the
patient, got spontaneous disappearance hcv two months lrlt,
demonstrated cd56+t cells strongly developed fasl trail
expressions.
conclusion: study, clinical immunological findings suggested that
intraportal dst might affect clearance hcv host immunity
and ifn-ribavirin therapy.
