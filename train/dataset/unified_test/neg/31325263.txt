background: herpes zoster (hz) caused varicella-zoster virus ( vzv )
reactivation. united states, zoster vaccine (zostavax) indicated hz
prevention patients ≥50 years.
aims: evaluate immunogenicity, safety, tolerability zostavax in
healthy indian subjects, support registration india.
methods: open-label, single-arm study conducted 10 sites india.
healthy indians (≥50 years) received single zostavax dose. immunogenicity was
assessed vzv-specific antibody titer using gpelisa assay. vzv-specific
antibody geometric mean titers (gmt; day 1 pre-vaccination, week 6
post-vaccination) geometric mean fold-rise (gmfr; week 6 post-vaccination)
were assessed. safety evaluated incidence adverse events (aes) 
serious adverse events (saes) within 42 days vaccination. two-sided 95%
confidence intervals (cis) evaluated using t-distribution natural
log-transformed values.
results: 250 subjects (mean age, 58.6 years) enrolled vaccinated, 244 
subjects completed 6-week follow-up. overall, subjects per-protocol
population gmt 149.8 gpelisa units/ml (n=250; 95% ci: 132.6, 169.2) day
1 pre-vaccination, 410.8 gpelisa units/ml (n=243; 95% ci: 373.0, 452.6) at
week 6 post-vaccination. gmfr vzv-specific antibody day 1 pre-vaccination
to week 6 post-vaccination 2.8 (95% ci: 2.5, 3.1). overall, 67 subjects
(26.8%) experienced aes, 48 (19.2%) reporting injection-site aes 38
(15.2%) reporting non-injection-site aes. sae-abdominal pain bronchitis-was
reported one (0.4%) patient each. one death, unrelated 
the vaccine.
limitations: since zostavax introduces new live attenuated virus, clinical
reactivation zostavax virus wild-type vzv need differentiated.
conclusions: healthy indians ≥50 years, zostavax well tolerated and
resulted expected vzv-specific antibody titer levels 6 weeks
post-vaccination.
