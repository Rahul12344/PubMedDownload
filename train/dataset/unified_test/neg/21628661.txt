samples people inject drugs (pwid) throughout world. objective 
this paper meta-analyze effects risk-reduction interventions hcv
seroconversion identify effective intervention types.
methods: performed systematic review meta-analysis published and
unpublished studies. eligible studies reported association between
participation interventions intended reduce unsafe drug injection hcv
seroconversion samples pwid.
results: meta-analysis included 26 eligible studies behavioral
interventions, substance-use treatment, syringe access, syringe disinfection, and
multicomponent interventions. interventions using multiple combined strategies
reduced risk seroconversion 75% (pooled relative risk, .25; 95% confidence 
interval, .07-.83). effects single-method interventions ranged .6 1.6.
conclusions: interventions using strategies combined substance-use treatment
and support safe injection effective reducing hcv
seroconversion. determining effective dose combination interventions
for specific subgroups pwid research priority. however, meta-analysis
shows hcv infection prevented pwid.
