transformation mouse peritoneal macrophages bone marrow cells simian
virus 40.

takayama h.

a fraction cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages bone marrow cells
acquired ability divide infection simian virus 40 (sv40). two
types transformed lines obtained. transformants isolated 400-60 days
after infection display macrophage specific properties ingestion 
of opsonized red blood cells, possession fc receptors complement
receptors, acid phosphatase activity throughout whole culture phase.
cells transformed lines isolated trypsin selection 2--6 months after
infection displayed properties cell density became high cell
growth arrested. cells latter type transformed lines, sv40
t-antigen intensely demonstrated immunofluorescence growing phase, 
but weakly stationary phase. suggested the
reversion phenotype progenitor (expression macrophage specific
functions) depends physiological state culture; however, is
uncertain whether development macrophage functions directly related
to sv40 t-antigen.
