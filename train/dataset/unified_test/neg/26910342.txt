the role reactive oxygen species-producing nadph oxidase family enzymes
in pathology influenza virus infection remains enigmatic. previous
reports implicated nadph oxidase 2 influenza virus-induced inflammation. 
contrast, nadph oxidase 1 (nox1) reported decrease inflammation mice
within 7 days post-influenza virus infection. however, effect nadph
oxidase 1 lethality adaptive immunity influenza virus challenge
has explored. report improved survival decreased morbidity
in mice catalytically inactive nadph oxidase 1 (nox1*/y) compared with
controls challenge a/pr/8/34 influenza virus. changes lung 
inflammation obvious nox1*/y control mice, observed
alterations cell response influenza virus day 15 post-infection,
including increased interleukin-7 receptor-expressing virus-specific cd8+ cells
in lungs draining lymph nodes nox1*/y, increased cytokine-producing 
cells lungs spleen. furthermore, greater percentage conventional 
interstitial dendritic cells nox1*/y draining lymph nodes expressed the
co-stimulatory ligand cd40 within 6 days post-infection. results indicate that
nadph oxidase 1 modulates innate adaptive cellular immune response to
influenza virus infection, also playing role host survival. results
suggest nadph oxidase 1 inhibitors may beneficial adjunct therapeutics
during acute influenza infection.
