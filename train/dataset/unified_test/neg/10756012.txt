glycoproteins (gm), e (ge), (gi) pseudorabies virus (prv) required
for efficient formation mature virions. simultaneous absence gm the
ge/gi complex results severe deficiencies virion morphogenesis and
cell-to-cell spread, leading drastically decreased virus titers a
small-plaque phenotype (a. brack, j. dijkstra, h. granzow, b. g. klupp, t. c.
mettenleiter, j. virol. 73:5364-5372, 1999). serial passaging noncomplementing
cells virus mutant unable express gm, ge, gi resulted reversion 
of small-plaque phenotype restoration infectious virus formation to
the level gm(-) mutant. genetic analyses showed reversion the
phenotype accompanied genomic rearrangement led fusion a
portion ge gene encoding cytoplasmic domain 3' end the
glycoprotein gene, resulting expression chimeric gd-ge protein. since
this indicated intracytoplasmic domain ge responsible the
observed phenotypic alterations, ul10 (gm) gene deleted prv mutant, 
prv-107, specifically lacked cytoplasmic tail ge. regarding one-step
growth, plaque size, virion formation observed electron
microscope, mutant lacking gm ge cytoplasmic tail proved very
similar ge/i/m triple mutant. thus, data indicate the
cytoplasmic tail ge responsible observed phenotypic effects
in conjunction deletion gm. hypothesize cytoplasmic domain of
ge specifically interacts components capsid and/or tegument, leading 
to efficient secondary envelopment intracytoplasmic capsids.
