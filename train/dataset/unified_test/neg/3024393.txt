the involvement gangliosides receptors sendai virus established
previously using experimentally produced receptor-deficient cells. search 
for naturally occurring counterpart, nctc 2071 cells emerged likely
candidate. cells native state agglutinated infected
by sendai virus, infected virus gangliosides gd1a, gt1b,
or gq1b supplied culturing medium. preliminary analysis indicated
that nctc 2071 cells contained unusually high ratio sialoglycoproteins to
gangliosides. brief treatment cell surface protease trypsin
made greater 99% native monolayer susceptible infection the
wild-type virus contains viral attachment protein hn. (incubation of
the trypsin-treated cells temperature-sensitive mutant missing hn produced
no detectable infection.) increased binding cholera toxin, a
ganglioside-specific probe, incubation cells trypsin and
sialidase, consistent hypothesis gangliosides complex than
gm1 surface nctc 2071 cells trypsin treatment increases
their accessibility. presence receptor gangliosides lipid extracts of
nctc 2071 cells confirmed thin-layer chromatography ganglioside
fraction binding cholera toxin. results demonstrate that
cells containing receptor gangliosides may still resistant infection
because expressed properly cell surface receptors for
interaction hn protein sendai virus.
