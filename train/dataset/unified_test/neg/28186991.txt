hepatitis b virus (hbv) major risk factor chronic liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). random integration hbv dna host
genome frequent hcc leading truncation hbv dna, particularly at
the c-terminal end hbv x protein (hbx). c-terminally truncated hbx
(hbx-δc) implicated playing pro-oncogenic role in
hepatocarcinogenesis. however, mechanism whereby hbx-δc1 contributes to
hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. study, investigated the
functional role hbx-δc1 regulating liver cancer stem cell (csc) properties.
using tet-on inducible system, found hbx-δc1 enhanced csc properties
including self-renewal, tumorigenicity, chemoresistance, migration expression
of liver csc markers, compared full-length hbx counterpart and
vector control. interestingly, hbx-δc1 conferred resistance hcc cells towards 
sorafenib treatment suppression apoptotic cascade. addition,
hbx-δc1 upregulated panel stemness genes, nanog found be
among significant one trasnfected cell lines. consistently,
nanog upregulated human hcc samples hbx-δc1 expression.
furthermore, induction csc properties hbx-δc1 via stat3/nanog
pathway, administration stat3 inhibitor abolished hbx-δc1-induced
self-renewing capacity. conclusion, data suggest hbx-δc1 enhances
liver cscs properties stat3/nanog cascade, provide new insight 
the therapeutic intervention hbv-related hcc.
