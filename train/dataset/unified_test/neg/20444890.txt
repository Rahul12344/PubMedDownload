merkel cell carcinoma (mcc) aggressive skin cancer. recently, 
demonstrated human merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv) clonally integrated 
approximately 80% mcc tumors. however, direct evidence whether oncogenic
viral proteins needed maintenance mcc cells still missing. to
address question, knocked mcv t-antigen (ta) expression in
mcv-positive mcc cell lines using three different short hairpin rna
(shrna)-expressing vectors targeting exon 1 tas. mcc cell lines used
include three newly generated mcv-infected cell lines one mcv-negative cell
line mcc tumors. notably, mcv-positive mcc cell lines underwent growth
arrest and/or cell death upon ta knockdown, whereas proliferation of
mcv-negative cell lines remained unaffected. despite increase number of
annexin v-positive, 7-amino-actinomycin (7-aad)-negative cells upon ta
knockdown, activation caspases changes expression and
phosphorylation bcl-2 family members consistently detected ta
suppression. study provides first direct experimental evidence ta
expression necessary maintenance mcv-positive mcc mcv is
the infectious cause mcv-positive mcc.
