leukocyte migration inhibitory factor primary recurrent ocular infections 
by herpes simplex-virus.

grabner g, jarisch r.

using direct assay leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (lmif),
cell-mediated immunity herpes simplex virus (hsv) antigen measured in
patients primary recurrent ocular hsv infections. primary 
and recurrent epithelial disease significantly lower production lmif
than control population herpetic infection least year 
or longer (p less 0.001). contrary, patients deep stromal
involvement anterior uveitis showed significant migration inhibition hsv
antigen, similar one found healthy control group. clinical 
possible therapeutic implications thes findings discussed.
