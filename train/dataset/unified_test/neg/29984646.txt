influenza viruses severe human pathogens pose persistent threat to
public health. year people die influenza virus infection that
of breast cancer. due limited efficacy associated current influenza
vaccines, well emerging drug resistance small molecule antiviral
drugs, clear need develop new antivirals novel mechanisms of
action. influenza virus polymerase complex become promising target 
the development next-generation antivirals several reasons.
firstly, influenza virus polymerase, forms heterotrimeric complex
that consists pa, pb1, pb2 subunits, highly conserved. secondly, both
individual polymerase subunit (pa, pb1, pb2) inter-subunit interactions
(pa-pb1, pb1- pb2) represent promising drug targets. lastly, growing insight into
the structure function polymerase complex spearheaded the
structure-guided design new polymerase inhibitors. review, we
highlight recent progress drug discovery assay development targeting the
influenza virus polymerase complex discuss therapeutic potentials.
