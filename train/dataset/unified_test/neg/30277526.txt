rett syndrome (rtt) neurodevelopmental disorder caused mutations or
deletions methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2), brain-enriched
transcriptional regulator. mecp2 highly expressed neuronal maturation
and deficiency results impaired dendritic morphogenesis reduced
dendritic spine numbers developing neurons. however, whether mecp2 deficiency 
impacts integration new neurons directly assessed. this
study, developed modified rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic retrograde
tracing method interrogate presynaptic integration mecp2-deficient new
neurons born adult hippocampus, region lifelong neurogenesis and
plasticity. found selective deletion mecp2 adult-born new neurons
impaired long-range connectivity cortex, whereas connectivity 
within local hippocampal circuits subcortical regions not
significantly affected. showed knockdown mecp2 primary
hippocampal neurons also resulted reduced network integration. interestingly, 
(1-3) insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1), small peptide clinical trial 
testing rtt, rescued neuronal integration deficits mecp2-deficient neurons
in vitro vivo. addition, (1-3) igf-1 treatment corrected aberrant
excitability network synchrony mecp2-deficient hippocampal neurons. our
results indicate mecp2 essential immature neurons establish
appropriate network connectivity.
