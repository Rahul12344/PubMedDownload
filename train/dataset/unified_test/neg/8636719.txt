genetic heterogeneity hepatitis b virus (hbv) shown influence 
the serological pattern clinical picture hbv infection. thailand a
high transmission rate hbv, molecular epidemiology hbv strains
circulating region hitherto unknown. study, hbv strains
from 34 thai hbsag-positive patients investigated. proportion 
samples, antigenically important region gene (n = 18), pre-s2
and precore genes (n = 15) sequenced pcr amplification. four strains
had in-frame deletions upstream region pre-s2 gene, all
deletions ending nucleotide. one three anti-hbe positive
strains without translational stop codon 28 precore gene, a
one nucleotide insertion precore gene. insertion would cause frame 
shift result nonsense protein expressed, thus providing one
explanation lack hbeag patient. several rare unique amino
acid changes region residues 120 161 protein were
found. glycine 145 changed alanine one strain, position showed
an apparent mixture glycine arginine another. total, 10 strains
displayed unexpected changes related normal variability
between subtypes genetic subgroups. concluded considerable
heterogeneity hbv strains thailand could clinical and
epidemiological importance region high hbv transmission rates.
