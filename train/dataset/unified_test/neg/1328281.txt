to determine vp4 (p type) specificity porcine rotaviruses, full- and
partial-length gene 4 probes produced cloned gottfried osu porcine 
rotavirus genomic segment 4 cdnas. gene 4 segments prototype
gottfried (vp7 serotype 4) osu (vp7 serotype 5) porcine rotavirus strains
were selected study distinct p types occurrence of
rotaviruses similar serotypes among swine. partial-length gene 4 cdnas 
produced amplified polymerase chain reaction (pcr) encompassed
portions variable region (nucleotides 211 612) vp8 encoded by
genomic segment 4. hybridization stringency conditions necessary optimal 
probe specificity sensitivity determined dot northern (rna) blot
hybridizations diverse group human animal rotaviruses of
heterologous group serotypes representative group b c porcine
rotaviruses. pcr-derived gene 4 probes specific the
full-length gene 4 probes demonstrated equivalent sensitivity. gottfried 
pcr-derived probe hybridized gottfried, sb2, sb3, sb5 g serotype 4
porcine rotaviruses. osu pcr-derived probe hybridized osu, ee, a580, and
sb-1a porcine rotaviruses equine h1 rotavirus. results hybridization
reactions pcr-derived gene 4 probes selected porcine rotavirus
strains agreed previous serological genetic analyses, indicating their
suitability diagnostic reagents.
