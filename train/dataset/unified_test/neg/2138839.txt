from 1985 1987 within framework health monitoring programme, the
occurrence s. aureus rodent colonies caretakers been
surveyed. obtain information s. aureus subtypes, isolates were
subjected phage typing using international set bacteriophages. strains 
derived pathological processes also randomly chosen isolates from
healthy animal carriers personnel underwent lysotyping. respect to
the animals every hygienic unit harbours characteristic s. aureus
lysotype(s). among these, usually one pattern dominates pathological processes
and healthy carriers, although spectrum phage types distributed among 
caretakers shows much greater variation attendants are
suspected transient carriers. comparison earlier
investigation done institute decade ago (lenz et al. 1978) shows
the prevalence completely different phage types.
