although cd103-expressing dendritic cells (dcs) widely present nonlymphoid
tissues, transcription factors controlling development their
relationship dc subsets remain unclear. mice lacking transcription
factor batf3 defect development cd8alpha+ conventional dcs
(cdcs) within lymphoid tissues. demonstrate batf3(-/-) mice also lack
cd103+cd11b- dcs lung, intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns), dermis,
and skin-draining lymph nodes. notably, batf3(-/-) mice displayed reduced priming
of cd8 cells pulmonary sendai virus infection, increased pulmonary
inflammation. mlns intestine, batf3 deficiency resulted the
specific lack cd103+cd11b- dcs, population cd103+cd11b+ dcs
remaining intact. batf3(-/-) mice showed evidence spontaneous
gastrointestinal inflammation normal contact hypersensitivity (chs)
response, despite previous suggestions cd103+ dcs required immune
homeostasis gut chs. relationship cd8alpha+ cdcs and
nonlymphoid cd103+ dcs implied shared dependence batf3 further
supported similar patterns gene expression shared developmental
dependence transcription factor irf8. data provide evidence a
developmental relationship lymphoid organ-resident cd8alpha+ cdcs and
nonlymphoid cd103+ dcs.
