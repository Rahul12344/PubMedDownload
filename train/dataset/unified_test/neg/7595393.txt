tobacco rattle virus (trv) isolate ppk20 transmitted paratrichodorus
pachydermus nematodes. factor(s) determining vector transmissibility been
shown located trv rna 2. sequence determination revealed ppk20 rna 
2 contains three open reading frames encoding coat protein (cp) proteins 
with molecular masses 29.4 32.8 kda. 29.4 32.8 kda protein-coding 
genes showed significant sequence similarity known tobravirus
gene. full-length cdna ppk20 rna 2 cloned 35s promoter nos
terminator infected plants co-inoculated ppk20 rna 1. deletions

translation cp putative 29.4 32.8 kda proteins detected in
infected leaves. possible role ppk20 rna 2 non-structural genes trv
vector transmission discussed.
