background: majority emerging infectious diseases zoonotic
(transmissible animals humans) origin, therefore integrated
surveillance disease events humans animals recommended to
support effective global response disease emergence. past decade 
there extensive global surveillance highly pathogenic avian
influenza (hpai) infection animals humans, few
attempts compare data streams evaluate utility such
integration.
methodology: compared reports bird outbreaks hpai h5n1 egypt for
2006-2011 compiled world organisation animal health (oie) un
food agriculture organization (fao) empresi reporting system confirmed
human h5n1 cases reported world health organization (who) egypt during
the time period.
principal findings: human cases bird outbreaks showed cyclic pattern
for country whole, statistically significant temporal
correlation data streams. governorate level, first
outbreak birds season usually always preceded first human
case, time lag events varied widely, suggesting regional
differences zoonotic risk and/or surveillance effectiveness. multivariate
risk model, lower temperature, lower urbanization, higher poultry density, and
the recent occurrence bird outbreak associated increased risk a
human case hpai governorate, although positive predictive
value bird outbreak low.
conclusions: integrating data streams surveillance human animal cases 
of zoonotic disease holds promise better prediction disease risk and
identification environmental regional factors affect risk. such
efforts also point gaps human animal surveillance systems and
generate hypotheses regarding disease transmission.
