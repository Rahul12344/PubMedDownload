interference tumor suppressor pathways polyomavirus-encoded tumor
antigens (t-ags) result transformation. consequently, thought that
t-ags encoded merkel cell polyomavirus (mcpyv), virus integrated âˆ¼90% 
all merkel cell carcinoma (mcc) cases, major contributors tumorigenesis.
the mcpyv large t-ag (lt-ag) preserved key functional domains present 
all family members also acquired unique regions flank lxcxe
motif. regions may mediate unique functions, may modulate those
shared t-ags polyomaviruses, functional studies mcpyv t-ags 
required. here, performed comparative study full-length or
mcc-derived truncated lt-ags regard biochemical characteristics,
their ability bind retinoblastoma (rb) p53 proteins, their
transforming potential. provide evidence full-length mcpyv lt-ag may 
directly bind p53 nevertheless significantly reduce p53-dependent
transcription reporter assays. although early region expression constructs
harboring either full-length mcc-derived truncated lt-ag genes transform
primary baby rat kidney cells, truncated lt-ags bind p53 reduce
p53-dependent transcription. interestingly, shortened lt-ags exhibit high 
binding affinity rb, shown coimmunoprecipitation vitro binding
studies. additionally, show truncated mcpyv lt-ag proteins expressed 
at higher levels wild-type protein able partially
relocalize rb cytoplasm, indicating truncated lt proteins may have
gained additional features distinguish full-length
protein.importance: mcpyv one 12 known polyomaviruses naturally
infect humans. among these, particular interest since only
human polyomavirus known involved tumorigenesis. mcpyv thought 
causally linked mcc, rare skin tumor. tumors, viral dna is
monoclonally integrated genome tumor cells 90% all
mcc cases, integrated mcv genomes, furthermore, harbor signature
mutations so-called early region selectively abrogate viral
replication preserving cell cycle deregulating functions virus. this
study describes comparative studies early region t-ag protein characteristics,
their ability bind rb p53, transforming potential.
