a reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (rt-npcr) detection 
of hepatitis e virus (hev) rna serum established using two pairs of
oligonucleotide acid open reading frame 1 2 (orf1 orf2) hev cdna 
as inner outer primers. eleven serial sera two rhesus monkeys
experimentally infected hev tested hev rna established
rt-npcr. hev rna became detectable two monkeys sixth day 
ninth day, respectively, persisted 17th 22nd day after
infection, respectively. twenty-eight serum specimens 41 patients with
acute sporadic hepatitis e hev rna positive (68.3%). proportions positive
hev rna patients sera collected one ten days, 11 20 days 21 34
days onset disease 72.7% (16/22), 70.0% (7/10) 55.5% 
(5/9), respectively. suggests viremia hev lasts shorter period, 
proportion serum positive hev rna decreases course disease.
