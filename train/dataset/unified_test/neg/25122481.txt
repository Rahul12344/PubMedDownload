small interfering rna (sirna)-directed gene silencing plays major role in
antiviral defense. virus-derived sirnas inhibit viral replication infected
cells potentially move neighboring cells, immunizing incoming
virus. viruses evolved various ways evade suppress sirna production
or action. here, show 21-, 22-, 24-nucleotide (nt) viral sirnas
together constitute 19% total small rna population oryza sativa
plants infected rice tungro bacilliform virus (rtbv) cover strands 
of rtbv dna genome. however, viral sirna hotspots restricted short
noncoding region transcription reverse-transcription start sites.
this region generates double-stranded rna (dsrna) precursors sirnas and, in
pregenomic rna, forms stable secondary structure likely inaccessible to
sirna-directed cleavage. transient assays, rtbv protein p4 suppressed
cell-to-cell spread silencing enhanced cell-autonomous silencing, which
correlated reduced 21-nt sirna levels increased 22-nt sirna levels. 
findings imply rtbv generates decoy dsrna restricts sirna production to
the structured noncoding region thereby protects regions viral
genome repressive action sirnas, viral protein p4 interferes
with cell-to-cell spread antiviral silencing.
