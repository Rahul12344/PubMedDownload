hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) typically develops liver chronic
hepatitis cirrhosis, activation oncogenes inactivation tumor
suppressor genes occurs carcinogenesis via genetic epigenetic
mechanisms. recent advancements development analyses examining 
cancer genome revealed information regarding genetic alterations hcc
tissues. according previous studies, incidence recurrent genetic
alterations individual genes thought relatively rare limited 
a subset cancer-specific genes tumor suppressor p53, rb genes
and oncogenes ctnnb1. however, recent whole-genome analyses exome
sequencing tumor dna revealed numerous novel alterations of
cancer-related genes pathways critical hcc development. addition,
various risk factors hcc, presence absence hepatitis b 
c virus, may affect mutation profile corresponding cancer genome. on
the hand, genome-wide association studies also identified important
single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved hcc development, may allow
detection group high risk hcc emergence. analyses clarify
how malignancy treated, diagnosed prevented effectively.
