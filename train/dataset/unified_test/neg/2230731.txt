the nucleotide sequence rna 3 two subgroup strains cucumber mosaic
virus (cmv), fny-cmv m-cmv, determined compared nucleic
acid protein level previously determined, corresponding (partial)
sequences rna 3 five subgroup strains: c-cmv, d-cmv, i17f-cmv,
o-cmv y-cmv. fny-cmv rna 3 composed 2216 nucleotides (nt) m-cmv rna
3 2214 nt. rnas contain two open reading frames, 3a gene coat
protein gene. rnas showed little nucleotide sequence divergence,
either five subgroup strains. nucleotide 
sequence variation observed two 13 differences 120 123 nt 5'
non-translated regions, six 17 differences 840 nt 3a genes, two 15
differences 296 299 nt intergenic regions, three 25 differences in
the 657 nt coat protein genes two 10 differences 299 303 nt 3'
non-translated regions. protein sequence similarity also high, one to
four differences 279 amino acids 3a proteins two 13
differences 218 amino acids coat proteins. limited nucleotide
sequence variation among nine strains cmv also shown using rna
protection assay probe specific fny-cmv rna 3. limited variation
shown rna 3 strains cmv different passage histories, isolated in
different countries 50 year period, suggests maintenance the
highly conserved nucleotide sequence may important viral rna
functions interactions.
