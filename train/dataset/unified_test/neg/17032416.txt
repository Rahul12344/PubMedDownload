background/aim: pegylated interferon (peg-ifn) plus ribavirin standard
therapy hepatitis c. peg-ifn several antiviral mechanisms, role
in hepatitis c treatment seems related immunomodulatory effect.
ribavirin, antiviral agent, potentiates ifn activity added it. both
drugs associated adverse reactions different magnitudes. autoimmune
phenomena reported treatment. paper, describe
cases alt/ggt flares peg-ifn plus ribavirin treatment, related to
the appearance anti-golgi antibody disease progress.
methods: investigated three patients hepatitis c severe alt/ggt
flares peg-ifn ribavirin treatment coinciding anti-golgi complex 
antibody marker autoimmunity. reviewed medical files
and tested anti-golgi antibody stored sera 25 patients treated with
conventional ifn 14 patients treated peg-ifn.
results: three patients male, 45 years age; relapsers
and non-responders. anti-golgi antibody positive treatment coinciding 
with alt/ggt flares hepatitis c virus (hcv)-rna negativity, disappearing
after stopping treatment, normalization alt/ast levels. one patient had
progression fibrosis f2 f3 despite negativity hcv-rna. last 
group, two patients treated peg-ifn experienced alt/ggt flares but
without anti-golgi antibody
conclusions: presence anti-golgi complex antibody could marker a
temporary autoimmune phenomenon progressive disease.
