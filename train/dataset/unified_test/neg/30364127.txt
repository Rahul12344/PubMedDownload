natural killer (nk) cells important maintenance innate immune system
stability serve first line defense tumors virus
infections; act either directly indirectly regulated via
co-operation inhibitory stimulatory surface receptors. recently
reported inhibitory receptor, tigit, expressed nk cell surface;
however, expression level function tigit nk cells hiv
infection unknown. study, first time, investigated the
expression function tigit nk cells hiv-infected individuals. our
data demonstrate level tigit higher nk cells patients
infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) compared hiv-negative
healthy controls. tigit expression inversely correlated cd4+ cell
counts positively correlated plasma viral loads. additionally, levels of
the tigit ligand, cd155, higher cd4+ cells hiv-infected
individuals compared healthy controls; however, no
difference level activating receptor, cd226, recognizes the
same ligands tigit. furthermore, tigit found specifically up-regulated 
on cd226+ nk cells hiv-infected individuals, either ril-10, ril-12 +
ril-15, could induce tigit expression cells. addition, high tigit
expression inhibited production interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) nk cells,
while tigit inhibition restored ifn-γ production. overall, results
highlight important role tigit nk cell function suggest potential
new avenue development therapeutic strategies toward functional cure
for hiv.
