the bacteriophage p1 late promoter sequence ps controls expression the
genes tail-fibre operon. transcription ps occurs the
second half p1 vegetative growth cycle positively regulated 
product phage gene 10. study degenerate oligonucleotides used
as primers site-directed mutagenesis reactions order construct large
set point mutations within late promoter sequence ps. total 35
independent single point mutations isolated mutants tested for
promoter activity. mutations escherichia coli-like -10 region a
late operator sequence, containing symmetric sequence centred around position
-22, resulted significant reductions promoter strength. these
mutations alter base-pairs highly conserved among known late
promoter sequences p1 family. addition, insertion mutants change
the spacing -10 late operator indicate special
topological arrangement two boxes crucial late promoter
function. results suggest product gene 10 binds specifically to
a late operator order activate transcription p1 late promoter
sequences.
