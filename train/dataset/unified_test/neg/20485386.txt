viral prokaryotic abundance, production diversity determined
throughout water column subtropical atlantic ocean assess potential
variations relation viruses prokaryotes. prokaryotic abundance
and heterotrophic activity decreased one three orders magnitude,
respectively, epi- abyssopelagic layer. although lytic viral 
production (vp) decreased depth, lysogenic vp variable throughout the
water column show trend depth. bacterial, archaeal and
viral community composition depth-stratified determined automated 
ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, terminal-restriction fragment length
polymorphism randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr, respectively. generally,
the number operational taxonomic units (otus) reveal consistent trends
throughout water column. viral prokaryotic abundance strongly
related heterotrophic prokaryotic production, suggesting similar linkage
strength viral prokaryotic communities lower epi- the
abyssopelagic layer atlantic ocean. strikingly, prokaryotic viral 
parameters exhibited similar variability throughout water column to
the abyssopelagic layers, suggesting dark ocean dynamic system
as lower epipelagic layer. also indicates viruses apparently
having similar role prokaryotic mortality dark oceanic realm in
surface waters. twofold increase bacterial otus 2750 m
depth >5000 m depth concurrent decrease viral otus, however,
suggests viruses might exhibit wider host range deep waters in
surface waters.
