we isolated cdna clones murine c-myb mrna contain approximately 2.8
kb 3.9-kb mrna sequence. nucleotide sequencing shown clones
extend 5' 3' sequences homologous v-myb oncogenes avian
myeloblastosis virus avian leukemia virus e26. sequence contains open 
reading frame 1944 nucleotides, could encode protein both
highly homologous, similar size (71 kd), chicken c-myb protein.
examination deduced amino acid sequence murine c-myb protein
revealed presence 3-fold tandem repeat 52 residues near n
terminus protein, enabled prediction likely
structural features protein. include high alpha-helix content, a
basic region toward n terminus protein overall globular
configuration. arrangement genomic c-myb sequences, detected using the
cdna clones probes, compared reported structure rearranged
c-myb certain tumour cells. comparison suggested rearranged
c-myb gene may encode protein which, like v-myb protein, lacks the
n-terminal region c-myb.
