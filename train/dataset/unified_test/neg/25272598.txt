this study aimed investigate immune adjuvant effect mechanism induced 
by chitosan nanoparticles carrying pjme/gm-csf. study, plasmid dna
(pjme/gm-csf) encapsulated chitosan prepare chitosan-pjme/gm-csf
nanoparticles using complex coacervation process. immunohistochemistry used
to detect type infiltrating cells site intramuscular injection. 
the phenotype functional changes splenic dcs measured flow
cytometry different immunogens injected intramuscularly. killing
activity ctls assessed using lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release
assay. preparation chitosan-pjme/gm-csf nanoparticles matched expected
theoretical results. results also found that, pjme/gm-csf injection,
the incoming cells mixture macrophages, neutrophils, immature dcs. 
meanwhile, pjme/gm-csf increased expression mhc class ii molecules on
splenic dcs, enhanced ag capture presentation functions.
cell-mediated immunity induced vaccine. furthermore,
chitosan-pjme/gm-csf nanoparticles outperformed administration standard
pjme/gm-csf terms dc recruitment, antigen processing presentation, 
vaccine enhancement. findings reveal chitosan could used as
delivery vector dna vaccine intramuscular immunizations, enhance
pjme/gm-csf-induced cellular immune responses.
