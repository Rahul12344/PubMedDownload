recombinant virus 7 (r7), spontaneous deletion mutant sv7, a
molecular clone moloney murine sarcoma virus 124 (momusv 124), induces brain
lesions tumors subcutaneous tissue spleen infected mice. in
contrast, sv7 induces tumors spleen subcutaneous tissues. one 
the genetic differences r7 sv7 r7 encodes gag-mos protein
whereas sv7 encodes env-mos protein. investigate whether novel r7
gag-mos oncogene required brain lesion induction, two viruses (sv7d1 and
svm1) constructed r7 gag-mos sequences adjacent 53 bp
of 5' noncoding sequence replaced either sv7 or
myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (mpsv) env-mos oncogenes, respectively. like r7,
sv7d1 svm1 induced brain lesions tumors spleen subcutaneous
tissues. prominent component r7-, sv7d1-, svm1-induced tumors the
