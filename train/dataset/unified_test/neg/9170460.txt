objective: determine signs symptoms genital herpes pregnancy 
accurately identify primary genital herpes infections using serologic testing for
final classification.
methods: twenty-three women clinical signs symptoms suggestive of
primary genital herpes infections second third trimesters pregnancy
were subsequently cultured tested serologically (for herpes simplex virus
type 1 herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies) classified true 
primary (no herpes simplex virus type 1 type 2 antibodies), nonprimary
(heterologous herpes simplex virus antibodies present), recurrent (homologous 
antibodies present) infections.
results: one 23 women clinical illnesses consistent primary
genital herpes virus simplex infections serologically-verified primary
infection. primary infection caused herpes simplex virus type 1.
three women nonprimary type 2 infections, 19 women recurrent
infections. among culture-proven recurrent infections, 12 caused herpes
simplex virus type 2 three herpes simplex virus type 1. one infant
was born preterm, clinically significant perinatal morbidity observed.
conclusion: correct classification gestational genital herpes infections can
be accomplished clinical evaluation correlated viral isolation 
and serologic testing using type-specific assay. severe first episodes of
genital herpes infections among women second third trimesters of
pregnancy usually primary infections commonly associated with
perinatal morbidity.
