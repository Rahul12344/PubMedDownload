background: monitoring nevirapine (nvp) concentrations pediatric
patients gained interest since introduction nvp part the
preferred first-line antiretroviral regimen human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)-infected children resource-limited settings. adequate trough
concentrations nvp predict successful therapy, whereas subtherapeutic levels
are correlated virologic failure development resistance. aim of
this study determine extent agreement total free plasma
nvp concentrations nonstimulated saliva nvp concentrations evaluate
the feasibility saliva sampling alternative tool therapeutic drug
monitoring nvp children.
design methods: study designed observational cohort analysis.
nvp concentrations obtained paired plasma saliva samples pediatric
patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including nvp. nvp plasma saliva
concentrations determined tandem-mass spectrometric method. the
intraclass correlation coefficient bland-altman analysis used to
evaluate agreement assess pattern discrepancies between
measurements.
results: random paired plasma saliva nvp sampling, 19
african-american children (8 boys, 11 girls) median age 8.0 years 
enrolled. two male subjects recruited 12 hour nvp plasma saliva 
pharmacokinetics study. intraclass correlations saliva serum
measurements nvp concentrations indicated >90% agreement two
modes measurement. saliva concentrations reflected free concentrations
very closely average 34% higher. bland-altman plots indicated
that discrepancy saliva plasma measures consistent across 
range average nvp concentrations.
conclusions: study results strongly indicate agreement saliva and
plasma nvp concentrations pediatric patients hiv infection, basis 
of bland-altman analysis. nonstimulated nvp saliva concentrations used 
an alternative noninvasive, reliable, cost-effective method direct
measurement adherence application therapeutic drug monitoring nvp
therapy.
