intranuclear tubular structures observed cells alveolar cell
carcinoma lung described. structures composed membraneous 
tubules, measured 60 nm diameter, electron-dense central
core. unusual structures seen nuclei neoplastic cells (type 
ii pneumocytes). nature tubular structures remains unsolved, but
morphologic characteristics associated grnaulomatous reaction stroma
