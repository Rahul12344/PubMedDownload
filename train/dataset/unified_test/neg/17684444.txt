lung cancer still severe disease low survival rate due to
local invasion metastasis potentials spite many clinical challenges
using anti-cancer drugs. rho family small gtpases play pivotal roles cell
invasion metastasis carcinogenesis. study, explored the
inhibitory effect adenoviral vector encoding dominant negative mutants rac,
rhoa, rock human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (a549 sq5)
and mouse carcinoma cell line (lewis lung carcinoma, llc). cells showed
high expression rac, rho, rock, whereas faint bands detected 
normal human lung epithelial cells, bet-1a. efficiency adenoviral vector
transfer stronger a549 sq5 cells llc cells. dominant negative
forms rhoa (rho-dn) rac (rac-dn) decreased cell proliferation wst-8
assay increased number apoptotic cells a549 sq5 cells by
hoechst 33258 tunel staining. hand, dn form rock (rock-dn)
did show apparent changes compared proteins. transwell
chamber analysis showed migration/invasion activity significantly
suppressed gene transfection a549 sq5 cells rock-dn gene 
transfer required higher multiplicity infection show effects similar to
rho rac. although effect gene therapy cell-dependent, data
suggest adenoviral gene transfer rho family small gtpases one good
approach lung cancer therapy.
