countries asia-pacific region africa tend highest
prevalence hepatitis b infection worldwide. hepatitis b infection progresses
from asymptomatic persistently infected status chronic hepatitis b,
cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. aim
of review summarize rates risk factors progression between
disease states asia-pacific region africa. literature search was
conducted employing medline embase (1975-2003) using following key words:
hepatitis b, natural history, disease progression, cirrhosis, hepatocellular
carcinoma, mortality, africa asia-pacific region. bibliographies of
articles reviewed also searched. ranges annual progression rates were:
(i) asymptomatic persistent infection chronic hepatitis b, 0.84-2.7%; (ii)
chronic hepatitis b cirrhosis, 1.0-2.4%; (iii) cirrhosis hepatocellular
carcinoma, 3.0-6.6%. patients asymptomatic persistent infection chronic 
hepatitis b relatively low 5-year mortality rates (<4%); rates (>50%) were
much higher patients decompensated liver disease hepatocellular
carcinoma. data found progression rates african populations.
hepatitis b e antigen risk factor chronic hepatitis b, bridging
hepatic necrosis chronic hepatitis b increased risk cirrhosis. risk
factors hepatocellular carcinoma included cirrhosis, co-infection with
hepatitis c virus, genetic environmental factors. review, wide
ranges disease progression estimates documented, emphasizing need 
further studies, particularly africa, progression rates largely 
available. summarizing information factors associated disease progression
should assist focusing efforts arrest disease process 
risk.
