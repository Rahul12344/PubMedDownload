background & aims: aim study assess changes clinical
pattern hepatitis virus (hdv) infection italy, brought improved 
control hepatitis b viruses, establish natural history of
chronic hepatitis d.
methods: histological diagnosis clinical features 122 patients hdv
recruited 1987 1996 three italian tertiary referral centers (torino,
northern italy; san giovanni rotondo castellana grotte, southern italy) 
compared 162 patients collected centers previous
decade. patients groups least 6 months follow-up were
included new subgroup assess natural history disease.
results: among 162 patients referred 1977 1986, 9 (6%) mild hepatitis
at histology vs. 9 (8%) 122 patients referred second decade; 105 (65%) 
vs. 21 (17%) severe hepatitis; 46 (28%) vs. 38 (31%) histological
asymptomatic cirrhosis; 2 (1%) vs. 54 (44%) clinically overt cirrhosis.
for 159 patients (121 men 38 women; mean age, 34 +/- 11), follow-up more
than 6 months documented, included natural history
subgroup. 78 +/- 59 months follow-up, 112 (70%) survived free liver
transplantation: 9 underwent transplantation, 32 died liver failure, 6 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. estimated 5- 10-year probability of
survival free orthotopic liver transplantation 100% 100% patients 
with mild hepatitis, 90% 90% severe hepatitis, 81% 58% for
histological asymptomatic cirrhosis, 49% 40% clinical cirrhosis (p < 
0.01), respectively.
conclusions: occurrence fresh severe forms hepatitis diminished
greatly italy. contemporary patients represent cohorts infected years ago 
survived immediate medical impact hepatitis d. disease been
asymptomatic nonprogressive minority; majority, rapidly
advanced cirrhosis thereafter subsided stable clinical conditions for
more decade.
