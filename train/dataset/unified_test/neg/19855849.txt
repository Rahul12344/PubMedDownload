the present work describes novel interaction human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) rev protein cellular lens epithelium-derived growth 
factor p75 (ledgf/p75) protein vitro virus-infected cells. we
show, first time, formation rev-ledgf/p75 complex crucial
step regulating viral cdna integration. coimmunoprecipitation experiments at
various times virus infection revealed that, first, integrase enzyme
(in)-ledgf/p75 complex formed, replaced rev-ledgf/p75 and
rev-in complexes. supported vitro experiments showing rev
promotes dissociation in-ledgf/p75 complex. combination viral in
and cellular ledgf/p75 required proper integration viral cdna
into host chromosomal dna. findings demonstrate integration hiv-1
cdna regulated interplay viral rev host-cell ledgf/p75
proteins.
