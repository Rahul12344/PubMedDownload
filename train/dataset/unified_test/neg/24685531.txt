cervical screening cervical cancer death among older women: a
population-based, case-control study.

rustagi as, kamineni a, weinmann s, reed sd, newcomb p, weiss ns.

recent research suggests cervical screening older women associated
with considerable decrease cervical cancer incidence. sought quantify 
the efficacy cervical cytology screening reduce death disease.
among enrollees 2 us health plans, compared papanicolaou smear screening
histories women aged 55-79 years died cervical cancer 1980-2010 
(cases) women risk cervical cancer (controls). controls were
matched 2:1 cases health plan, age, enrollment duration. cytology
screening detectable preclinical phase, estimated 5-7 years
before diagnosis cervical neoplasia asymptomatic but
cytologically detectable, ascertained medical records. total 39
cases 80 controls eligible. odds ratio cervical cancer death
associated screening presumed detectable preclinical phase was
0.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.10, 0.63) adjustment matching
characteristics, smoking, marital status, race/ethnicity using logistic
regression. estimate cervical cytology screening women aged 55-79 
years united states could avert 630 deaths annually. results provide
a minimum estimate efficacy human papillomavirus dna screening-a more
sensitive test-to reduce cervical cancer death among older women.
