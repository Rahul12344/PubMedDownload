infectious salmon anemia (isa) viral disease occurring farmed atlantic
salmon (salmo salar) characterized lethargy, anorexia, anemia and
death. control disease new brunswick, canada, 7.5 million fish from
outbreak cages destroyed since 1997. despite changes made farmers,
2002 worst year ever isa losses region. evaluated the
associations potential risk factors isa outbreaks the
atlantic-salmon sites new brunswick. multilevel study 
site-level design retrospective cohort study cage-level design
was modified case-cohort study. questionnaire divided site-level
questions, cage-level questions hatchery information. important factors
identified study categorized environmental, farmer controlled
or industry controlled according capacity change eliminate them.
environmental risk factors increasing depth net (if nets 
<or=9 m, odds ratio (or)=3.34) decreasing depth water underneath the
net (if depth water underneath net >3m, or=3.34) part
dictated site location. wild pollock (pollachius virens) cage reflects 
the number wild pollock live site location. >or=1000
pollock cage, odds disease cage increased 4.43-fold. risk
factors farm control include increasing number times that
the salmon treated sea lice (or=3.31 lice treatments <or=2 times),
transferring small smolts seawater (or=2.40 smolts weighed >99 g) and
improving adaptation smolts seawater reduce post-transfer
mortalities (or=4.52 least one cage post-transfer
mortalities >5%). industry-controlled factors need addressed the
industry whole. organizing boat travel minimize time frequency of
boats travelling sites currently reviewed. be
extremely important or=9.43 processing boats travel within 1 km of
the site or=4.03 site dry feed delivered feed company. 
because hazard ratio increased stepwise 1 nearest neighbor with
isa >or=5 km 5.5 nearest site isa within 0.5 km,
increasing distance sites might necessary effective control.
