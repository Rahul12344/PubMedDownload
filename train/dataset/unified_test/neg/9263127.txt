the serine esterase tl2 human t4+ lymphocytes binding component to
hiv-1 glycoprotein gp120 seems play role hiv-1 infection
mechanism. recombinant variants kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor
aprotinin investigated ability inhibit tryptase tl2 the
binding gp120 enzyme. furthermore, viral replication hiv-1 
investigated h9 cell cultures influence recombinant aprotinin and
bikunin variants. contrast native aprotinin, recombinant variant
[arg15, phe17, glu52] aprotinin reactive-site sequence homologous the
v3 loop hiv-1 gp120 showed specific inhibition tryptase tl2 (> 80%).
however, [leu15, phe17, glu52] aprotinin variant hydrophobic subsites
was potent inhibitor binding gp120 tryptase tl2 (68%). 
results show enzyme activity purified tryptase tl2 inhibited not
only variants basic amino acids, also hydrophobic residues
in reactive-site region. therefore, tryptase tl2 typical
trypsin-like chymotrypsin-like protease. investigations inhibition hiv-1
replication h9 cell cultures showed tryptase tl2 involved the
mechanism virus internalization human lymphocytes. [leu15, phe17,
glu52] aprotinin showed significant retardation syncytium formation a
period 5 days 1 micro concentration. similar investigations were
performed recombinant variants bikunin, light chain human
inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor. single-headed variant [arg94] delta 2
bikunin inhibited slightly syncytium formation period 2 days a
2.2 micro concentration. wild-type bikunin full-length variants showed 
no effect, possibly due steric hindrance second domain the
double-headed inhibitor.
