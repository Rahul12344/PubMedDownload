signature peptides neuraminidase antigen across common circulating
human subtypes type b influenza identified bioinformatic
alignment translated gene sequences. detection peptides within
the high-resolution mass spectra whole antigen, virus, vaccine digests
enables strains rapidly directly typed subtyped. importantly,
unique signature peptides pandemic (h1n1) 2009 influenza identified and
detected enable pandemic strains rapidly directly differentiated
from seasonal type (h1n1) influenza strains. detection peptides
can enable origins neuraminidase gene monitored case of
reassorted strains.
