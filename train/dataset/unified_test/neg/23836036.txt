influenza long considered serious global health threat. highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus (iav) h5n1, particularly currently
identified iav/h7n9 humans china, illustrates influenza still a
significant public health problem. due high mortality h5n1, development
of safe effective vaccines divergent strains h5n1 influenza virus,
especially one capable inducing strong systemic local immune
responses vaccinated targets, challenge immediate importance. in
the present study, designed two recombinant proteins containing highly
conserved hemagglutinin (ha) residues 81-122 h5n1 fused fc human igg
(ha-81-122-fc) and/or foldon (fd) trimeric motif (ha-81-122-fdc), identified 
their immunogenicity vaccinated mice. found ha-81-122-fc and
ha-81-122-fdc proteins formed high molecular weight dimer oligomer,
respectively, induced potent igg antibodies vaccinated mouse sera lung
wash. stronger igg1 (th2-associated) igg2 (th1-associated) antibody responses
could raised sera mice following last vaccination ha-81-122-fdc
than raised ha-81-122-fc vaccination. importantly, ha-81-122-fdc able
to elicit high titers iga antibodies vaccinated mouse lung wash sera
through parenteral immunization pathway. data demonstrated the
recombinant protein containing highly conserved ha residues 81-122 h5n1 fused 
with fd fc could induce strong local mucosal systemic humoral immune
responses vaccinated animals, revealing possibility developing an
effective fc-mediated mucosal influenza vaccine.
