approximately 2% world's population chronically infected hepatitis
c virus (hcv). chronic hepatitis c culminate end stage liver disease and
liver cancer infection untreated. current therapy partially
effective vaccine hcv exist. since discovery hcv the
etiologic agent causing hepatitis c several experimental tools been
developed improved understanding viral life cycle the
interaction hcv human cells. however, remains challenging study hcv
infection native liver environment given narrow species tropism,
limited humans chimpanzees. mice rendered susceptible hcv
infection transplanting human hepatocytes immunocompromized liver injury 
strains. human liver chimeric mice useful challenge model human
hepatotropic pathogens utility hampered inability mount 
functional immune responses practical aspects including high costs, low
throughput, donor-to-donor variability. barriers restrict hcv
species tropism incompletely understood. previously shown that
expression human cd81 human ocln required hcv uptake mouse
cells. led construction genetically humanized mouse model for
hcv infection. here, provide detailed protocol generation these
animals highlight applications studying hcv biology and
preclinical testing drug vaccine candidates.
