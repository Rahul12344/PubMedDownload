changes epstein-barr virus (ebv) cell rna levels assayed following
immunoglobulin g (igg) cross-linking-induced replication latency 1-infected
akata burkitt b lymphoblasts. ebv replication assayed membrane gp350
expression approximately 5% igg cross-linking increased more
than 50% 48 h induction. seventy-two hours igg cross-linking,
gp350-positive cells excluded propidium iodide well gp350-negative cells.
ebv rna levels changed temporally parallel previously defined sensitivity
to inhibitors protein viral dna synthesis. bzlf1 immediate-early rna levels
doubled 2 h reached peak 4 h, whereas bmlf1 doubled 4 h a
peak 8 h, brlf1 doubled 8 h peak 12 h. early rnas peaked 8
to 12 h, late rnas peaked 24 h. hybridization intergenic sequences
resulted evidence new ebv rnas. surprisingly, latency iii (ltiii) rnas for
lmp1, lmp2, ebnalp, ebna2, ebna3a, ebna3c, barts detected 8 12 h
and reached maxima 24 48 h. ebna2 lmp1 full ltiii levels 48 
h localized gp350-positive cells. thus, ltiii expression a
characteristic late ebv replication b lymphoblasts epithelial
cells immune-comprised people (j. webster-cyriaque, j. middeldorp, n.
raab-traub, j. virol. 74:7610-7618, 2000). ebv replication significantly altered 
levels 401 akata cell rnas, 122 rnas changed twofold relative
to uninfected akata cells. mitogen-activated protein kinase levels were
significantly affected. late expression ltiii associated induction of
nf-kappab responsive genes including ikappabalpha a20. exclusion of
propidium, expression ebv ltiii rnas proteins, up-regulation of
specific cell rnas indicative vital cell function late ebv replication.
