highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) decreases plasma viremia the
limits detection majority hiv-infected individuals, thus serving 
slow disease progression. however, haart targets actively replicating virus 
and unable eliminate latently infected, resting cd4(+) cells. such
infected cells potentially capable reinitiating virus replication upon
cessation haart, thus leading viral rebound. agents would eliminate
these reservoirs, used combination haart, could thus provide a
strategy eradication hiv. prostratin preclinical candidate that
induces hiv expression latently infected cd4(+) cells, potentially leading
to elimination virus-induced cytopathic effect host anti-hiv
immunity. here, report synthesis series designed prostratin
analogs report vitro ex vivo studies activity relevant to
induction hiv expression. members series 100-fold more
potent preclinical lead (prostratin) binding cell-free pkc, in
inducing hiv expression latently infected cell line prostratin-like
modulation cell surface receptor expression primary cells hiv-negative
donors. significantly, selected members also tested hiv induction in
resting cd4(+) cells isolated infected individuals receiving haart and
were found exhibit potent induction activity. potent agents 
extension related tunable analogs accessible studies described
herein facilitate research preclinical advancement strategy
for hiv/aids eradication.
