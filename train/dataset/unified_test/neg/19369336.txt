high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) e6 protein induces telomerase activity
through transcriptional activation htert, catalytic subunit telomerase.
hpv type 16 (hpv16) e6 interacts two splice variants nfx1 increase
htert expression. nfx1-91 transcriptional repressor htert is
polyubiquitinated targeted degradation hpv16 e6 concert with
e6-associated protein. previously showed nfx1-123 augments htert
expression binding cytoplasmic poly(a) binding proteins (pabpcs). in
this study, determined unlike nfx1-91, nfx1-123 cytoplasmic protein 
that colocalized pabpcs shuttle pabpcs nucleus
and cytoplasm. nfx1-123 requires pam2 motif, binds pabpcs,
and r3h domain, putative nucleic acid binding capabilities, to
increase htert mrna levels telomerase activity keratinocytes expressing
hpv16 e6. keratinocytes expressing hpv16 e6 overexpressing nfx1-123, there
was increased protein expression vitro-transcribed rna fused 5' 
untranslated region (5' utr) htert. posttranscriptional increase in
expression required pam2 motif r3h domain nfx1-123 well the
coexpression hpv16 e6. nfx1-123 bound endogenous htert mrna increased 
stability hpv16 e6-expressing human foreskin keratinocytes, nfx1-123
increased stability vitro-transcribed rna fused 5' utr of
htert. together, studies describe first evidence posttranscriptional
regulation htert, direct interaction cytoplasmic protein
nfx1-123 htert mrna, hpv16 e6-expressing keratinocytes.
