cross-linking experiments performed human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) reverse transcriptase (rt) mutants unique cysteine residues at
several positions (positions 65, 67, 70, 74) fingers subdomain 
p66 subunit. two approaches used--photoaffinity cross-linking disulfide 
chemical cross-linking (using oligonucleotide contained n(2)-modified 
dg reactive thiol group). former case, cross-linking occur to
any nucleotide either dna strand, latter case, specific
cross-link produced template enzyme. neither the
introduction unique cysteine residues fingers the
modification residues photocross-linking reagents caused a
significant decrease enzymatic activities rt. able use 
model system investigate interactions specific points fingers
domain rt double-stranded dna (dsdna). photoaffinity cross-linking 
template modified rts cys residues positions 65, 67, 70, 74 of
the fingers domain p66 subunit relatively efficient. azide-modified
cys residues produced 10 25% cross-linking, whereas diazirine modified
residues produced 5 8% cross-linking. disulfide cross-linking yields up
to 90%. modified rts preferentially photocross-linked 5'
extended template strand dsdna template-primer substrate. preferred
sites interactions extended template, 5 7 bases beyond the
polymerase active site. hiv-1 rt quite flexible. conformational
changes associated substrate binding. cross-linking used detect
intramolecular movements associated binding incoming deoxynucleoside 
triphosphate (dntp). binding incoming dntp polymerase active site
decreases efficiency cross-linking, causes modest changes 
preferred positions cross-linking. suggests interactions between
the fingers p66 extended template involve "open" configuration 
the enzyme fingers away active site rather closed
configuration fingers direct contact incoming dntp. this
experimental approach used measure distances site the
surface protein interacting molecule.
