objective: cumulative evidence supports epstein-barr virus (ebv)-infected
natural killer (nk) cells induce severe systemic cutaneous inflammation in
patients hypersensitivity mosquito bites (hmb). order understand
the pathogenesis hmb, established ebv-infected cell line and
characterized cytological profiles.
materials methods: novel ebv-infected nk-cell line, designated nked, was
established patient hmb used present study along two
other nk-cell lines, kai3 khyg-1.
results: nked expressed latency ii-related transcripts. nked cells were
positive cd2 cd161 antigens, negative cd3, cd16, cd34, cd56, 
t-cell receptor α/β γ/δ antigens. although nked cells contained several
cytotoxic molecules, cells extremely poor cytotoxic activity. the
majority nked cells negative perforin, major histocompatibility
complex class i-restricted nk-cell receptors, cd94 kir2d, activating
receptor, nkg2d. nked cells, however, secreted higher levels tumor necrosis
factor-α. stimulation phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate tumor necrosis
factor-α induced expression bzlf1 messenger rna nked kai3 cells,
indicating transition latent- lytic-cycle infection.
conclusions: data suggested nked cells revealed low cytotoxic
effect probably low expression levels perforin, the
ability release proinflammatory cytokines. nked cells reflect the
characteristics hmb, different pathogenic nk cells
proliferating hmb patient, difference indicated pathogenic nk
cells could change character presence interleukin-2.
