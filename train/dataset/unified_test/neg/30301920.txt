the trex complex mediates passage bulk cellular mrna export nuclear
export factor tap/nxf1 via export adaptors alyref uif, appear act
in redundant manner. trex complex recruitment nascent rna coupled 5'
capping, splicing polyadenylation. therefore facilitate expression from
their intronless genes, herpes viruses evolved mechanism circumvent
these cellular controls. central process protein conserved 
icp27 family, binds viral transcripts cellular trex complex components 
including alyref. identified novel interaction hsv-1 icp27
and n-terminal domain uif vivo, used nmr spectroscopy locate 
uif binding site within intrinsically disordered region icp27. also
characterized interaction sites icp27 homolog orf57 kshv uif
and alyref using nmr, revealing previously unidentified binding motifs. both
orf57 icp27 interaction sites alyref uif partially overlap,
suggestive mutually exclusive binding. data provide map binding
sites responsible promoting herpes virus mrna export, enabling future studies
to accurately probe interactions reveal functional consequences for
uif alyref redundancy.
