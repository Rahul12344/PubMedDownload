recently, two prophylactic vaccines significant oncogenic human 
papillomaviruses (hpv; 16 18) became available efficiently protect
against persistent hpv infection cancer precursors. however, clinical trials 
performed vaccines provide evidence would influence 
the natural history prevalent hpv infections, is, eventual
malignant progression. because, even optimistic assumption high
vaccine coverage, significant reduction cancer incidence be
expected two decades, need immune therapeutic strategies 
be offered persistently infected individuals benefit the
prophylactic vaccines. here, describe reasons failure the
published approaches hpv-specific therapies, highlight promising developments 
and present view future developments.
