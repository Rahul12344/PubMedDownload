hiv-1 taken immature monocyte derived dendritic cells (imddcs) into
tetraspanin rich caves virus either transferred t
lymphocytes enter endosomes resulting degradation. hiv-1 binding and
fusion dc membrane results low level de novo infection also 
be transferred lymphocytes later stage. previously reported
that hiv-1 induce partial maturation imddcs stages trafficking.
here show cd45⁺ microvesicles (mv) contaminate purified hiv-1
inocula due similar size density, affect dc maturation, de novo hiv-1
infection transfer lymphocytes. comparing imddcs infected with
cd45-depleted hiv-1bal matched non-depleted preparations, presence of
cd45⁺ mvs shown enhance dc maturation icam-1 (cd54) expression, 
is involved dc∶t lymphocyte interactions, restricting hiv-1 infection of
mddcs. furthermore, dc culture hiv-1 infected (p24⁺) mddcs more
mature bystander cells. depletion mvs hiv-1 inoculum markedly
inhibited dc∶t lymphocyte clustering induction alloproliferation as
well limiting hiv-1 transfer dcs lymphocytes. effects mv
depletion functions reversed re-addition purified mvs
from activated non-activated supt1.ccr5-cl.30 primary cells.
analysis protein complement mvs hiv-1 inocula before
and mv depletion showed heat shock proteins (hsps) nef the
likely dc maturation candidates. recombinant hsp90α β nef induced dc 
maturation icam-1 expression, greater combined. results suggest
that mvs contaminating hiv-1 released infected lymphocytes may be
biologically important, especially enhancing cell activation, uptake 
by dcs vitro vivo, particularly mvs detected the
circulation hiv-1 infected subjects.
