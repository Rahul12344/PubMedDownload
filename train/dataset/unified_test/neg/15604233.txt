genetic engineering tumor cells express granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) interleukin (il)-2 induce synergistic 
immune antitumor effects. paradoxically, combination also reported
to down-regulate certain immune functions, highlighting unpredictability of
dual cytokine use. hypothesized gm-csf il-2 fusion transgene (gift)
could circumvent limitations yet preserve synergistic features. designed 
a fusion cdna murine gm-csf il-2. protein structure computer modeling of
gift protein predicted intact ligand binding domains cytokines. b16 
mouse melanoma cells gene modified express gift (b16gift), these
cells unable form tumors c57bl/6 mice. irradiated b16gift whole-cell
tumor vaccine could also induce absolute protective immunity challenge by
live b16 cells. mice established melanoma, b16gift therapeutic cellular
vaccine significantly improved tumor-free survival compared b16
expressing il-2 gm-csf. show gift induced significantly
greater tumor site recruitment macrophages combined gm-csf il-2 and
that macrophage recruitment arises novel chemotactic feature gift. in
contrast suppression gm-csf natural killer (nk) cell recruitment despite
coexpression il-2, gift leads significant functional nk cell infiltration
as confirmed nk-defective beige mice. conclusion, demonstrated a
fusion gm-csf il-2 invoke greater antitumor effect both
cytokines combination, novel immunobiological properties arise from
such chimeric constructs.
