the role type interferons (ifns) mediation acute viral symptoms
(fever, somnolence, anorexia, etc.) unknown. determine role type i
ifn selected symptom development, body temperature sleep responses a
marginally lethal dose x-31 influenza virus examined mice a
targeted mutation ifn receptor type (ifn-ri knockouts) compared to
wild-type 129 svev control mice. mice monitored 48 h determine
baseline temperature sleep profiles prior infection, 9 days
following infection. hypothermic responses virus perceptible beginning at
64 h post-infection (pi) marked ko mice 108 h, when
hypothermia became exaggerated wild-type controls. temperatures of
wild-type mice continued decline day 9 temperatures ifn-ri ko
mice stabilized. time spent non-rapid eye movement sleep (nrems) increased 
ko mice hypothermia marked returned baseline levels, while
nrems continued increase wild-type mice day 9. sleep
parameters [time spent rapid eye movement sleep (rems), relative nrems eeg
slow wave activity, nrems eeg power density] reduced wild-type mice
compared kos days 3 8 rems low frequency eeg power density
increased wild-type relative kos. conclusion, results indicate 
the presence functional type ifn slightly ameliorates disease symptoms early
in x-31 infection exacerbating disease symptoms later infection.
