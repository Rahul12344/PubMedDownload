oligonucleotide fingerprint analyses influenza c virion rna recovered from
five different isolates.

five different isolates influenza c virus isolated period of
32 years four different continents compared rna genome
oligonucleotide fingerprinting analyses. earliest isolate influenza c
virus reported 1949 taylor (19) served reference strain for
this study. results obtained using technique comparing relatedness
between viruses clearly showed strains distinct. however, the
similarities pattern oligonucleotide fingerprints marked for
the recent virus isolates (1966-1979), whereas reference strain c/taylor
shows pronounced differences. results consistent high
degree serological crossreaction amongst influenza c viruses isolated a
long period time, property sets group viruses apart type
