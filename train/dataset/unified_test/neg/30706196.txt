bungowannah virus, belongs genus pestivirus within family
flaviviridae, associated myocarditis high incidence of
stillbirths pigs. 2003, virus initially detected large pig
farming complex two separate sites new south wales, australia. now,
it detected locations. despite program depopulation
and disinfection, virus could eradicated one affected
farm complexes, bungowannah unit, became endemic second complex,
the corowa unit. present study, genetic variability virus isolates 
collected 2003 2014 endemically infected population been
retrospectively investigated. phylogenetic analysis carried based on
sequences e2 ns5b coding regions full-length open-reading
frame revealed isolates different farm sites closely
related, samples collected 2010 2014 corowa farm site
clustered different branch phylogenetic tree. since 2010, a
high-genetic stability rna virus within corowa farm complex, probably
due effective adaptation virus affected pig population, could
be observed.
