background: evidence norovirus genotype important factor in
determining norovirus epidemiology, detailed information lacking. this
report examined question studying whether mix norovirus genotypes 
associated norovirus outbreaks health care settings different that
in nonhealth care settings.
methods: norovirus outbreaks tested victoria, australia, 2002-2005 were
classified either health care nonhealth care. open reading frame 1
nucleotide sequencing analysis used determine mix norovirus
genotypes health care nonhealth care norovirus outbreaks.
results: three common genotypes detected (gi.2, gii.4, giib),
the differences health care nonhealth care settings significant.
gii.4 significantly common health care settings nonhealth
care settings, whereas genotypes gi.2 giib significantly common
in nonhealth care settings health care settings.
