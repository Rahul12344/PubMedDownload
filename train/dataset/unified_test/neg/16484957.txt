aim: prevalence incidence rates hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in
our general population, assessed countries intermediate
endemicity. geographical variation prevalence rate hbv infection is
also known. aim study estimate incidence rate hbv
infection among family contacts patients suffering acute hepatitis b 
to determine need immunoprophylaxis i.e. prevalence rate hbv markers.
methods: prospective study 757 acute hepatitis b cases families 
were included. 118 families members tested hbv markers the
time verification hbv infection index case subsequently 4 times 
bimonthly. serum samples tested alt/ast, hbsag, antihbc igm, anti
hbs (behring, abbott).
results: among 1877 family contacts 757 index cases within surveillance
period 1 year, 163 cases icteric acute hepatitis b registered.
the prevalence hbv markers anicteric infection determined among 286
family contacts 118 index cases representative sample intra-familial 
transmission infection. families risk factors as
drug-addiction, haemodialysis, transfusion others, excluded. these
families found 56 (19.58%) carriers hbv markers 58 (20.27%) cases of
acute hepatitis b verified, 33 (56.89%) unicteric 25 (43.10%) icteric.
when wives taken index cases, found transmitted the
infection husbands 44.73% cases vice versa 9.67%. study
44.56% secondary cases children mothers suffering from
acute hepatitis b.
conclusions: according socio-economic, ethnic cultural characteristics 
the familial way living macedonia, noticed acute hbv infection 
be transmitted within members one family. small proportion family
members, carriers hbv markers considered resistant infection. most
family members non-resistant immunization i.e. vaccination seen a
very reasonable action.
