the vector competence ae. aegypti (l.) ae. albopictus (skuse) from
southern taiwan dengue 1 virus studied elucidate distribution
of dengue infection 1987-1988 outbreak. brain ae. aegypti was
infected early 3 intrathoracic inoculation. esophagus the
proboscis (tissues within labium) infected 5 inoculation. the
salivary gland highly susceptible virus, specific infection
site found. gangli, muscles, diverticula within thorax not
infected. abdominal area, ventral diverticula, malpighian tubules,
ganglia, dorsal vessel infected. however, entire gut was
susceptible dengue 1 virus, although infected simultaneously. 
a certain type midgut epithelial cells infected virus. the
ovarioles, oviducts, accessory glands frequently infected. however, 
spermathecae infected, perhaps chitin-rich outer layer.
infections testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, accessory glands of
males also detected study. tissues proboscis never
infected ae. albopictus frequently infected ae. aegypti,
indicating virus may escape salivary gland barrier efficiently 
in ae. aegypti ae. albopictus. mosquitoes fed hanging 
drops, salivary gland infection transmission rates ae. aegypti were
always higher ae. albopictus. taiwan, ae. aegypti appears 
a competent vector transmission dengue 1 virus ae.
albopictus.
