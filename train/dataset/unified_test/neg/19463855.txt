cxcr4 plays essential role first discovered coreceptor entry of
t cell tropic isolates hiv-1. blocking surface expression receptor
may potential strategy prevent hiv-1 infection. lentiviral vector,
plenti6/v5-s-k, expressing sdf-kdel fusion protein constructed a
replication-incompetent lentiviral stock produced. lentiviral stock was
transduced cd34(+) hhsc transient expression recombinant
protein, sdf-1, assayed using indirect immunofluorescence. surface
expression cxcr4 cd34(+) hhsc pretreated different amounts of
recombinant lentiviral vectors detected flow cytometric analysis. marked
down-regulation cxcr4 expression cells transduced recombinant
lentiviral vectors plenti6/v5-s-k observed flow cytometry with
pe-conjugated anti-human cxcr4 monoclonal antibodies showed percentages
of inhibition effects cxcr4-sdf-1 mediated syncytium formation are
presented concentration. p24 antigen levels cell culture supernatants 
detected 4th, 7th, 10th day, 10(3) tcid50 hiv-1 infected cd34(+) 
hhsc evaluate inhibitory effect plenti6/v5-s-k transduction hiv-1
infection. cells transfected plenti6/v5-s-k significant reduction 
of hiv-1 dp27 infection compared controls (p<0.05).
