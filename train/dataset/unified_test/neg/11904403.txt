rnase p complexes proposed novel rna-based gene interference
strategy inhibit gene expression human malignancies infectious
diseases. approach based sequence-specific design external
guide sequence (egs) rna molecule specifically hybridize almost any
complementary target mrna facilitate cleavage rnase p enzyme
component. designed truncated rnase p-associated egs molecule to
specifically recognize u5 region hiv-1 mrna mediate cleavage of
hybridized mrna rnase p enzyme. genes encoding u5-egs (560)
molecule, well u5 egs (560d) antisense control, cloned into
retroviral plasmids transferred cd4(+) cell line. transfected cells 
were exposed increasing concentrations hiv-1 clinical isolates clades 
a, b, c, f. heterogeneous cultures cd4(+) cells expressing u5 egs
(560) molecule observed maintain cd4 levels, devoid of
cytopathology, produce hiv p24 gag antigen 30 days after
exposure hiv-1 clades multiplicity infection 0.01. identical
cells expressing u5 egs (560d) antisense control molecule underwent loss of
cd4 expression, produced elevated levels hiv-1, formed large syncytia
similar untreated cells. viral inoculum increased time 
exposure (multiplicity infection = 0.05), inhibitory effect u5 egs 
(560) molecule overwhelmed, viral-mediated cytopathology particle
production delayed compared control cell populations. viral replication
and cytopathology associated infection multiple hiv-1 clades be
effectively inhibited cd4(+) cells expressing rnase p-associated u5 egs
(560) molecule.
