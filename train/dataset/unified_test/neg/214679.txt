immunoelectroosmophoresis, complement fixation, immunofluorescence inoculated 
cell cultures, electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were
compared detection rotavirus faecal samples calves. rotavirus 
particles could detected 39 98 faecal samples electron
microscopy. immunofluorescence, complement fixation, and
immunoelectroosmophoresis detected rotavirus antigens 39, 42, 30 samples, 
respectively. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated rotavirus
antigens 49 faecal samples. assay sensitive also simple to
perform suitable large-scale testing.
