antibody status toxoplasma gondii also assessed. information on
preeclampsia pregnancy obtained linkage medical birth
registry norway.
results: thirty-three (3%) women developed preeclampsia. risk developing
preeclampsia seemed increased women seronegative the
viruses studied. seronegativity toxoplasma gondii show a
pattern.
interpretation: women seronegative antibodies viral agents
transmitted close contact seem likely develop preeclampsia. 
finding indicates women seronegative agents may acquire
primary infection pregnancy, subsequently increased risk of
