the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) mutant in1814 possesses insertion
mutation abolishes trans-activation immediate early (ie) transcription by
the virion protein vmw65. interactions in1814 host cell were
examined use vitro latency system relies infection human 
foetal lung (hfl) cells 42 degrees c prevent lytic growth virus. mutant 
in1814 retained hfl cells infection low m.o.i. incubation 
42 degrees c, reactivated superinfection monolayers viruses
that express hsv-1 ie protein vmw110. moreover, latency established by
in1814 analogous manner 37 degrees c. low cytotoxicity in1814
enabled investigation latency infection high m.o.i. (five
particles per cell) undertaken. 42 degrees c, 37 degrees c 
presence inhibitor dna synthesis, in1814 dna maintained low
abundance (one eight copies per infected cell) non-linear configuration. 
the absence trans-activation vmw65 therefore predisposes hsv latency, as
opposed lytic growth, hfl cells, resulting retention genome
in form resembling found vivo.
