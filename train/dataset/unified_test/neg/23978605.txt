the novel spf10 real-time pcr assay allows simultaneous amplification and
detection hpv target. way, lipa analysis hpv-negative samples 
can avoided, reducing workload cost. study aims evaluate the
performance spf10 real-time pcr combination lipa assay hpv
detection typing cervical samples. thirty-nine cervical samples were
subjected spf10 conventional pcr combination lipa assay.
subsequently, spf10 real-time pcr performed enable comparison
between spf10 conventional real-time pcr results. case of
discrepancy, samples subjected clart hpv2 assay. result, 27 
out 39 samples identified hpv-positive spf10 real-time pcr 
were genotyped lipa assay. twenty samples (74.1%) showed an
absolute agreement conventional real-time spf10 pcr (concordant),
three (11.1%) displayed additional fewer types (compatible), two (7.4%) did
not show similarity assays (discordant) remaining two
(7.4%) lipa-negative. two assays showed excellent strength of
agreement individual (κ=0.932) multiple genotype detection (κ=0.834). 
conclusion, two spf10 pcr methods comparable. therefore, spf10
real-time pcr subsequent lipa could used detection genotyping
of hpv cervical samples.
