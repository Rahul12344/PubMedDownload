in 1999, italy experienced devastating epidemic high-pathogenicity avian
influenza (hpai) caused h7n1 virus subtype. epidemic, a
ministerial decree passed implement control measures low-pathogenicity
avian influenza (lpai) due h5 h7 subtypes. investigated whether these
control measures decreased public expenditure associated epidemics 
of lpai hpai comparing direct consequential losses 1999
epidemic losses associated successive epidemics. estimated total 
economic burden epidemics euro650 million (euro217 million in
direct losses euro433 million consequential losses). 1999 epidemic
accounted losses (euro507 million: euro112 million direct
losses euro395 million consequential losses), whereas total economic
burden 5 successive lpai euro143 million (euro105 million direct
losses euro38 million consequential losses). results demonstrate
that implementation coordinated set disease-control measures, which
included emergency prophylactic vaccination, able reduce the
overall costs associated avian influenza epidemics. results also show
that application adequate lpai control measures may limit risk of
emergence hpai virus area high poultry density, allowing the
complete disruption poultry market huge associated costs be
avoided.
