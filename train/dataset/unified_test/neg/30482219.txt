porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2), highly prevalent, economically important
swine pathogen classified different genotypes (pcv2a-f) based on
phylogenetic analysis. since introduction extensive vaccination programs, 
at least two major shifts observed prevalence pcv2 genotypes.
the first genotype shift 2a towards 2b occurred around 2003, recent
years, witnessing second change genotype prevalence the
predominant 2b towards 2d.in study, pcv2d-2 isolate characterized a
potential challenge virus evaluation pcv2 vaccine efficacy.
ten-week-old pigs carrying low moderate levels maternally derived
antibodies pcv2 infected isolate nasal route. the
next 4 weeks post-infection, pigs monitored presence viremia,
fecal virus excretion, humoral immune responses. end the
post-infection observation period, samples taken mediastinal and
mesenteric lymph nodes animals tested viral load. gradual
depletion maternally derived antibodies sera piglets was
demonstrated elisa virus neutralization tests. following experimental
infection pcv2d-2, specific igm antibodies first detected 14 days post
challenge (dpch), igg class antibodies first detected 21 dpch. both
viremia virus shedding could detected 7 dpch, 36 50% the
pigs, respectively. proportion shedders reached 100% 14 dpch and
remained level, viremia demonstrated 86, 100, 100% of
the pigs 14, 21, 28 dpch, respectively. mediastinal and
mesenteric lymph nodes contained high levels virus (7.6 8.5 log10
copies/mg tissue, respectively).
