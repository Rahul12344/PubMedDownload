human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) stimulates arrested cells enter cell cycle by
activating cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), notably cdk2. several mechanisms 
involved activation cdk2. hcmv causes substantial increase the
abundance cyclin e stimulates translocation cdk2 cytoplasm 
the nucleus. further, abundance cdk inhibitors (ckis) p21cip1/waf1
(p21cip1) p27kip1 substantially reduced. activity cyclin e/cdk2
increases levels ckis, particularly p21cip1, fall. previously shown
that phenomena contribute priming cell efficient replication 
hcmv. study, mechanisms responsible decrease p21cip1
levels hcmv infection investigated measuring p21cip1 rna and
protein levels permissive human lung (lu) fibroblasts hcmv infection.
northern blot analysis revealed p21cip1 rna levels increased briefly 3 h 
after hcmv infection decreased nadir 24 h; thereafter, rna
levels increased 60% preinfection level. western blot analysis
demonstrated relative abundance p21cip1 protein roughly paralleled
the observed changes initial rna levels; however, final levels protein 
were much lower preinfection levels. transient increase 3 h
postinfection, p21cip1 abundance declined sharply next 24 h remained
at low level 96 h postinfection. disparity p21cip1 rna
and protein levels suggested degradation p21cip1 might affected in
hcmv-infected cells. treatment hcmv-infected cells mg132, inhibitor of
proteasome-mediated proteolysis, provided substantial protection p21cip1 in
mock-infected cells, mg132 much less effective protecting p21cip1 in
hcmv-infected cells. addition e64d z-leu-leu-h, inhibitor of
calpain activity, hcmv-infected cells substantially increased abundance of
p21cip1 concentration-dependent manner. verify p21cip1 a
substrate calpain, purified recombinant p21cip1 incubated either
m-calpain mu-calpain, resulted rapid proteolysis p21cip1. e64d
inhibited proteolysis p21cip1 catalyzed either m-calpain mu-calpain.
direct measurement calpain activity hcmv-infected lu cells indicated that
hcmv infection induced substantial sustained increase calpain activity, 
although change abundance either m- mu-calpain the
endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin. observed increase calpain
activity consistent increases intracellular free ca2+ and
phospholipid degradation hcmv-infected lu cells reported previously our
laboratory. considered together, results suggest increase in
calpain activity observed following hcmv infection contributes significantly to
the reduction p21cip1 levels resultant cell cycle progression.
