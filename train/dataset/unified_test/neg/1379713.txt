a number studies suggested hiv infection detected a
variety routinely fixed archival tissues using antibodies various viral
proteins. order study immunocytochemical approach, paraffin sections
were examined large panel commercially available monoclonal antibodies 
against various hiv proteins (5 antibodies p24, 1 p17, 1 gp41, 1
to gp120) using streptavidin-biotin method. polyclonal antibody p24
was also tested. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hiv infected cem e5 cells
were used positive controls. tissues aids patients included 31 kidneys, 8
lymph nodes, 2 spleens 3 brains. non-aids tissues examined 6 renal
biopsies focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 5 interstitial nephritis, 
6 reactive lymph nodes, brain encephalitis, patients not
known high risk hiv infection. additional negative controls
included: 1) replacement primary antibody hybridoma derived mouse
monoclonal igg1 standard, 2) omission primary antibody, 3) sections of
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cem e5 cells cultures infected hiv.
competition experiments excess recombinant p24 protein also performed. 
false positive staining igg1 standard antibodies hiv
proteins frequently seen tissues pathologic findings (inflammation,
hyalin degeneration), particularly following protein digestion. protein digestion
also major impact specific staining. digestion proteinase k
abolished specific staining core proteins virus (p17, p24)
