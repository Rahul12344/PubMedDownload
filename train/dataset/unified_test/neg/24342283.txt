several human animal myopathies, malignant hyperthermia (mh), central
core disease equine recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (rer) confirmed
or thought associated dysfunction skeletal muscle calcium
regulation. patients genetic cause unknown, when
mutational analysis reveals genetic variants unclear pathogenicity, defects 
are studied use muscle histopathology vitro contraction
tests, latter particular, assessing responses ryanodine receptor
agonists, caffeine. however, since muscle biopsy always suitable, 
researchers used cultured cells model diseases, examining
calcium regulation myotubes derived skin, following forced expression 
muscle-specific transcription factors. describe novel adenoviral vector
that used express equine myod dermal fibroblasts. permissive
conditions, transduced equine human fibroblasts differentiated into
multinucleated myotubes. demonstrate cells functional
excitation-calcium release mechanism and, similarly primary muscle-derived
myotubes, respond dose-dependent manner increasing concentrations of
caffeine. myod-induced conversion equine skin-derived fibroblasts offers an
attractive method evaluating calcium homeostasis defects vitro without the
need invasive muscle biopsy.
