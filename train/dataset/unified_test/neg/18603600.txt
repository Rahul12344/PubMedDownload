to probe mechanisms respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection in
early life forms important risk factor development chronic asthma, 
an airway hyper-responsiveness (ahr) animal model guinea-pigs persistent 
rsv infection established intranasal instillation 2 x 10(5)
plaque-forming units rsv. days 0, 7, 28, 42 60 postinoculation, rsv
copy numbers, airway function peptidergic innervation measured the
peripheral airways. results showed virus persistent the
lungs. persistent infection (days 42 60), lung resistance 
total cells, neutrophils eosinophils infected guinea-pigs increased
significantly; airway showed signs chronic inflammation; substance
p- calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive fibres increased, vasoactive 
intestinal polypeptide-positive fibres decreased. results suggest that
persistent rsv infection cause long-term chronic airway inflammation and
persistent airway neural network abnormality, may related the
occurrence ahr.
