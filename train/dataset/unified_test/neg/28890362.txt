the trimeric hiv-1-envelope (env) spike one the most glycosylated protein
complexes known, roughly half mass comprising host-derived n-linked
glycan. use molecular dynamics provide insight structural
dynamics protomer glycan movements coordinate shield the
env protein surface. 2-μs molecular dynamics simulation fully glycosylated
atomistic model hiv-1 sosip env trimer revealed spectrum of
protomer-scissoring trimer-opening movements. network analysis showed that
highly conserved glycans combined protomer scissoring restrict access 
the binding site cd4 receptor. network property betweenness
centrality appeared identify whether glycans spread restrict access or
cluster maintain high-mannose character shield. we also observed
stable microdomains comprising patches glycan, neutralizing antibodies
generally binding interface glycan microdomains. overall, our
results provide microsecond-based understanding env glycan shield.
