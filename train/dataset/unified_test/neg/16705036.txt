although prognosis patients early-stage breast cancer improved, 
the therapeutic options patients locally advanced metastatic disease
are limited. improve treatment patients, molecular mechanisms
underlying breast cancer invasion metastasis must understood. this
study, report signaling g12 family heterotrimeric g
proteins (galpha12 galpha13) promotes breast cancer cell invasion. moreover, 
we demonstrate inhibition g12 signaling reduces metastatic
dissemination breast cancer cells vivo. finally, demonstrate the
expression galpha12 significantly up-regulated earliest stages of
breast cancer, implying amplification g12 signaling may early event
in breast cancer progression. taken together, observations identify g12
family proteins important regulators breast cancer invasion suggest
that proteins may targeted limit invasion- metastasis-induced
patient morbidity mortality.
