transfer neor bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv1) dna rat embryo
fibroblasts led colony formation g418-containing medium, detectable
background controls neor dna alone. 50% drug-resistant
clones could propagated culture. genetic functions bpv1
involved colony formation long-term immortalization investigated
by translation termination mutations full-length genome, which
inactivate individual open reading frames, constructs open
reading frames separately expressed control long terminal repeat
promoter enhancers. expression either open reading frame e2 e5 was
sufficient formation drug-resistant colony, long-term growth in
culture required e6. significant cooperative effect observed upon 
cotransfection bpv1 ras oncogene dnas. expression early region of
the human papillomavirus type 16 also led immortalization rat embryo
fibroblast cells assay, and, unlike previously reported in
baby rat kidney cells, required neither activation heterologous promoter,
nor cooperating ras oncogene.
