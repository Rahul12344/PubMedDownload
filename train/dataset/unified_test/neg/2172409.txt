human hla-dr+ peripheral mononuclear cells (pbmc) produce interferon-alpha
(ifn-alpha) response herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) hsv-1-infected 
fibroblasts (hsv-fs). developed protocol, based partly technique
known enrich dendritic cells, allows greater 125-fold
enrichment ifn-alpha-producing cells. nylon wood nonadherent pbmc (nwna)
were fractionated 48% percoll gradient low-density (ld) and
high-density (hd) populations. ld cells 10- 30-fold enriched 
production ifn-alpha compared pbmc stimulated hsv-fs. ld cells
were treated deplete contaminating monocytes, cd3+ cells and
cd56+ natural killer (nk) cells. resulting population (cd3/cd56-depleted)
produced approximately 30,000 iu/ml ifn-alpha compared 3,000-10,000 iu/ml 
the corresponding ld cells 30-300 iu/ml pbmc. immunocytochemistry to
detect cytoplasmic ifn-alpha indicated pbmc, nwna, hd, ld, and
cd3/cd56-depleted populations contained average less 0.1%, 0.3%, less 
than 0.1%, 3%, 12% ifn-alpha-producing cells, respectively. cells
responsible ifn-alpha production response hsv-1 medium large
diameter possessed eccentric nuclei often indented, lightly
staining perinuclear areas. cd3/cd56-depleted populations fivefold
enriched hla-dr+ cells. enrichment procedure partially overcomes the
barrier low frequency contributed elusive identification of
these cells.
