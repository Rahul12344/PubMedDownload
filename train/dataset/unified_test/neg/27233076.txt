radiation chemotherapy commonly used treat human cancers damage
cellular dna. dna damage appears toxic cancer cells normal
cells, likely due deregulated checkpoint activation and/or deficiency 
dna repair pathways characteristics many tumors. however, unwanted
side effects arise result dna damage normal cells the
treatment.here, show roscovitine, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)
inhibitor inhibits cdk-1, cdk-2, cdk-5, cdk-7, cdk-9 due competitive 
binding atp site kinases, causes significant dna damage followed by
p53-dependent cell death human papilloma virus (hpv)-positive, in
hpv-negative, head neck cancer cells. since hpv positivity molecular
marker increased sensitivity cells roscovitine, reasoned that
systemic roscovitine administration would toxic healthy hpv-negative
tissue. indeed, low roscovitine doses significantly inhibited growth of
hpv-associated xenografted tumors mice without causing detectable side
effects.given inhibition cdks shown inhibit replication of
several viruses, suggest roscovitine treatment may represent selective 
and safe targeted therapeutic option hpv-positive head neck cancer.
