model coliphages (e.g., φx174, ms2, prd1) widely used surrogates
to study fate transport of pathogenic viruses environment and
during wastewater treatment. two groups coliphages (f-specific somatic)
are explored indicators viral fecal pollution ambient water.
however, detection quantification coliphages still largely rely on
time-consuming culture-based plaque assays. study, developed in-gel
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (glamp) system enabling coliphage ms2
quantification within 30 min using standard laboratory devices. viral particles
(ms2) immobilized lamp reagents polyethylene glycol hydrogel, and
then viral rnas amplified lamp reaction. due restriction
effect hydrogel matrix, one viral particle would produce one amplicon
dot. therefore, sample virus concentrations determined based the
number fluorescent amplicon dots using smartphone imaging. method
was validated using artificially spiked naturally contaminated water
samples. glamp results shown correlate well plaque assay counts ( r2
= 0.984, p < 0.05) achieved similar sensitivity quantitative
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr; 1 plaque-forming unit
per reaction). moreover, glamp demonstrated high level tolerance against
inhibitors naturally present wastewater, rt-qpcr completely
inhibited. besides ms2, glamp also used quantification other
microbial targets (e.g., escherichia coli salmonella). considering its
simplicity, sensitivity, rapidity, versatility, glamp holds great potential
for microbial water-quality analysis, especially resource-limited settings.
