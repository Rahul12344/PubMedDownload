influenza hemagglutinin, receptor-binding membrane fusion protein 
virus, prototypic model studies biological membrane fusion in
general. elucidate minimum number hemagglutinin trimers needed for
fusion, kinetics fusion induced reconstituted vesicles hemagglutinin
was studied using single-vesicle image analysis. surface density of
hemagglutinin fusion-activity sites vesicles varied, keeping the
surface density receptor-binding activity sites constant, co-reconstitution
of fusogenic form hemagglutinin, ha(1,2), non-fusogenic form,
ha(0), various ha(1,2):(ha(1,2) + ha(0)) ratios. rate fusion between
the hemagglutinin vesicles containing fluorescent lipid probe,
octadecylrhodamine b, red blood cell ghost membranes estimated the
time distribution fusion events single vesicles observed fluorescence
microscopy. best fit log-log plot fusion rate versus surface
density ha(1,2) exhibited slope 0.85, strongly supporting hypothesis 
that single hemagglutinin trimers sufficient fusion. ha(1,2)
(without ha(0)) reconstituted vesicles, dependence fusion rate on
the surface density ha(1,2) distinct ha(1,2)-ha(0)
co-reconstitution. latter result suggested interference fusion activity 
by hemagglutinin-receptor binding, without assume fusion mechanism
involving multiple hemagglutinin trimers.
