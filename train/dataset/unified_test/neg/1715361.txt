ctl directed highly conserved hiv-1 gag protein described in
hiv-1 seropositive persons may important host defense this
retrovirus. presently limited data available regarding specific
epitopes recognized ctl. study, performed detailed
examination gag-specific ctl response three hiv-1 seropositive
subjects, using unstimulated pbmc cloned ctl. lysis gag-expressing
targets found mediated cd3+cd8+ lymphocytes restricted class 
i ag. multiple class ag found restrict gag epitopes subject
studied, many three ag involved presenting gag ctl
epitopes single subject. majority gag-specific ctl activity found
to directed epitopes p24 subunit gag protein, at
least seven different hla class i-restricted ctl p24 epitopes identified these
three subjects. less ctl activity directed p17 subunit gag two
ctl epitopes identified protein. although many four different 
epitopes gag recognized using ctl single subject, none the
epitopes recognized ctl one subject. analysis gag
epitope recognition using cloned ctl demonstrated heterogeneity specificity
not appreciated using unstimulated pbmc. identification multiple
relatively conserved epitopes hiv-1 gag protein heterogeneity of
ctl responses protein may important implications vaccine
development understanding aids pathogenesis.
