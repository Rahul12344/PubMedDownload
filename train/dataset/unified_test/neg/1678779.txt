analysis restriction site polymorphism (rsp) human parvovirus b19 using
12 restriction endonucleases (res) recognizing four five bp sequences (4- or
5-bp res) revealed significant difference strains previously classified
as genome type, relationship two strains of
different genome types, thereby indicating global spread b19 virus strains. 
these findings demonstrate advantage set 4- 5-bp res the
calculation degree genetic diversity clearly necessary to
amend taxonomy b19 virus strains using res. examined the
nucleotide (nt) sequence nt 3141 3411, n terminus vp2
protein coding region, 12 b19 virus strains. pattern distribution of
nucleotide differences strains confirmed classification rsp
analysis. nt 3293 nt 3364, region antigenic epitope may
be encoded, evidence nucleotide change causing amino acid
change. thus, amino acid sequence potential epitope probably
conserved.
