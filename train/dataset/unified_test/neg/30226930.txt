high efficiency method detection isolation neuraminidase inhibitor
resistant influenza viruses fluorescence sialidase imaging.

[article english, japanese]

kurebayashi y.

influenza b viruses possess enzyme "sialidase" cleavages terminal
sialic acid glycochains. viral sialidase proteins highly expressed
on virus infected cells. developed sialidase imaging probe "btp3-neu5ac"
that enables histochemical fluorescence staining sialidase activity.
btp3-neu5ac able perform speedy easy fluorescence imaging these
virus infected cells, needs specific antibody cell fixation. in
addition, combination use anti-influenza drugs (sialidase inhibitors) and
btp3-neu5ac resulted selective fluorescence imaging detection and
high-efficiency isolation drug-resistant virus. fluorescence imaging of
drug-resistant virus powerful method study drug-resistance
mechanism, monitoring drug-resistant viruses. novel tool for
fluorescence imaging viral sialidase activity described review.
