marek's disease virus (mdv), highly cell-associated oncogenic chicken
herpesvirus, causes marek's disease domestic chickens. unique phosphoprotein
of mdv, pp38, previously associated maintenance of
transformation mdv-induced tumor cell lines. however, recently, biological
properties deletion mutant virus (rmd5deltapp38) revealed pp38 is
involved early cytolytic infection lymphocytes induction 
tumors. thus, pp38 important early cytolytic infection for
transformation. pp38 protein mdv serotype 1 vaccine strain
cvi988/rispens differs one amino acid compared pathogenic strains 
of mdv. monoclonal antibody, h19, recognizes serotype 1 mdv strains except
cvi988/rispens. previous studies also shown unique pp38 epitope 
cvi988/rispens induced high antibody response. order study role this
epitope protective properties cvi988/rispens, generated mutant
rmd5 virus wild type pp38 gene substituted of
cvi988/rispens (rmd5/pp38cvi). replication properties rmd5/pp38cvi, both
in vitro vivo, tumor induction examined. found the
biological properties rmd5/pp38cvi similar wild type rmd5 virus
with regards vivo replication, antibody response tumor induction. 
shows pp38 derived cvi988/rispens involved protective
properties previously suggested.
