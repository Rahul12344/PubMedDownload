objective: pancreatic beta-cells express three munc18 isoforms. much known
about roles munc18a (pre-docked secretory granules-sgs) munc18b
(newcomer sgs sg-sg fusion) insulin exocytosis. although shown to
influence glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis) rodents precise role
of munc18c insulin sg exocytosis elucidated. examined the
role munc18c human pancreatic beta-cells.
methods: munc18c-shrna/rfp lenti-virus (versus control virus) used knock
down expression level munc18c human islets single beta-cells.
insulin secretion granule exocytosis measured performing islets
perifusion, single-cell patch clamp capacitance measurements total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy (tirfm).
results: munc18c abundant cytosol human beta-cells. endogenous 
function munc18c assessed knocking (kd) islet expression by
70% employing lenti-shrna virus. munc18c-kd caused reduction cognate
syntaxin-4 islet expression exocytotic proteins, resulting in
the reduction gsis first- (by 42%) second phases (by 35%). single cell 
analyses rfp-tagged munc18c-kd beta-cells patch clamp capacitance
measurements showed inhibition readily-releasable pool (by 52%) and
mobilization reserve pool (by 57%). tirfm assess single sg behavior
showed munc18c-kd inhibition first phase gsis attributed reduction
in exocytosis pre-docked newcomer sgs, second phase inhibition
attributed entirely reduction newcomer sg fusion (sgs undergo minimal 
residence docking time plasma membrane fusion).
conclusion: munc18c involved distinct molecular machineries affect
exocytosis predocked newcomer sg pools underlie munc18c's role
in first second phases gsis, respectively.
