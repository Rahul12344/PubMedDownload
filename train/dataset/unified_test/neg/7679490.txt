the influenza m2 protein forms cation-selective ion channels blocked 
by anti-influenza drug amantadine. molecular model m2 channel is
presented bundle four parallel m2 transbilayer helices surrounds 
central ion-permeable pore. analysis helix amphipathicity used aid
determination orientation helices long axes. the
helices tilted n-terminal mouth pore wider the
c-terminal mouth. channel lined residues v27, s31 i42. residues d24
and d44 located opposite mouths pore, narrowest the
vicinity i42. energy profiles interaction channel na+,
amantadine-h+ cyclopentylamine-h+ evaluated. interaction profile 
na+ exhibits three minima, one mouth pore, one region
of residue s31. amantadine-h+ profile exhibits minimum close s31 a
barrier near residue i42. provides molecular model amantadine-h+ block
of m2 channels. profile cyclopentylamine-h+ exhibit a
barrier. predicted cyclopentylamine-h+ act m2 channel
blocker.
