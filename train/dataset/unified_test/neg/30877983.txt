production recombinant hbsag main component hepatitis b vaccine
has already established commercial scale. far, many studies 
performed optimize production process recombinant vaccine.
however, still aggregation dissociation rhbsag virus-like particles (vlps)
are major challenges downstream processing biomedicine. structural
diversity rhbsag dependent many factors including cell types, molecular 
characteristics expressed recombinant rhbsag, buffer composition well
as operation condition specific characteristics downstream processing
unit. hence, relatively easy implement single strategy prevent 
aggregation formation already established rhbsag production processes. this
study, examined efficacy weak anion exchange chromatography (iec)-
packed deae sepharose fast flow medium- isolation rhbsag vlps from
aggregated structures. purpose, influence ionic strength of
elution buffer key factor investigated isolation recovery of
rhbsag vlps. elution buffer electrical conductivity 27 and
31 ms/cm showed best results removing aggregated rhbsag based sec-hplc
analysis. results showed selected conductivity range, 79%
of rhbsag recovered purity 95%. percentage rhbsag vlps in
the recovered sample 94% 97.5% indicating could obtain
highly homogeneous rhbsag within acceptable quality level. tem, sds-page 
and western blot analysis also agreement quantitative
measurements.
