a combination gene cell-based therapies may provide significant advantages
over existing treatments terms effectiveness. however, long-term
efficient gene delivery difficult achieve many cell types,
including endothelial cells. developed freeze-thaw technique which
significantly increases transduction efficiency recombinant
adeno-associated virus vectors human aortic endothelial cells (23-fold) in
human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (128-fold) comparison current
methods transduction. freeze-thaw resulted transient significant
increase cell surface area 1,174 +/- 69.8 microm2 per cell. reduction of
cryogenic medium volume repeated freeze-thaw increased transduction
efficiency 2.8- 2.4-fold, respectively. trypsinization, dimethylsulfoxide,
and cold temperatures, also involved cell preservation, no
significant impact transduction efficiency. increased transduction also
observed mesenchymal stem cells (42-fold) freeze-thaw method. the
potential mechanism novel technique likely involves increase the
net permeable area biological membranes caused water crystallization. these
findings provide new approach gene delivery various cell types,
particularly resistant transduction conventional methods.
