the hla complex chromosome 6, especially hla class ii genes, plays an
important role pathogenesis insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm).
three solitary long terminal repeats (ltrs) described vicinity
of hla dq, two modifying genetic susceptibility type 1 diabetes on
high-risk hla dq haplotypes. therefore, investigated putative
regulatory properties retroviral promoters different cell lines,
including number b- t-lymphoblastoid cell lines bearing different dq
haplotypes, employing transient reporter gene assay. transcriptional
activity appropriate constructs harboring ltr linked luciferase
reporter gene revealed different expression patterns varied considerably
between investigated cell lines. dq-ltr3 showed clear activities, whereby the
levels luciferase gene expression also increased approximately 200-fold
in teratocarcinoma cell line gh. different b- t-cell lines, no
significant activity detected investigated ltrs. furthermore, 
we analyzed effect dq-ltr13 distinct dqb1 promoters could show
an increased activity dqb1*0302 promoter influence dq-ltr13. 
it varied 1.5- 6-fold different cell lines depending the
transcriptional orientation position ltr independent of
dq-ltr3. moreover, impact ltr different dqb1*0201 promoter
demonstrating decreasing effect. data indicate dq-ltr13-mediated
impact dqb1 promoter activity exists differs clearly between
selected promoters.
