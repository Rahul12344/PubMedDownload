rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (rrv) gamma-2-herpesvirus closely related
to kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8. have
previously reported transcript rrv latency-associated nuclear
antigen (r-lana) expressed lytic replication rhesus fibroblasts. 
this article, report development latent culture system rrv and
show mrna specific r-lana expressed latency well. have
characterized r-lana protein demonstrate exhibits nuclear
speckled localization possesses ability homodimerize. expressed
in rhesus fibroblasts, r-lana inhibit rrv lytic replication vitro. have
investigated mechanism behind inhibition find that, r-lana
itself little effect lytic promoters, dramatically decrease
the transactivation function rrv orf50 (rta), major viral
transcription factor. show mechanism repression
involves recruitment histone deacetylase complexes (hdacs), because
r-lana's ability repress orf50 transactivation completely reversed the
addition hdac inhibitor trichostatin (tsa). also report tsa
alone significantly reactivate rrv latently infected cells. propose
that repressive effects r-lana rrv orf50 transactivation serve to
downregulate transcription early genes late times lytic
cycle also help maintain viral latency preventing viral reactivation.
