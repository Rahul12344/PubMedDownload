despite enormous efforts hiv-1 vaccine developed elicits broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) protect infection date. high
antigenic diversity dense n-linked glycan armor, covers nearly the
entire hiv-1 envelope protein (env), major roadblocks development 
bnabs vaccination. addition, naive human antibody repertoire features a
low frequency exceptionally long heavy chain complementary determining regions
(cdrh3s), typical characteristic many hiv-1 bnabs use to
penetrate glycan armor. native-like env trimer immunogens induce potent
but strain-specific neutralizing antibody responses animal models to
overcome many obstacles towards development bnabs remains challenge.
here, review recent hiv-1 env immunization studies discuss strategies to
guide strain-specific antibody responses towards neutralization breadth.
