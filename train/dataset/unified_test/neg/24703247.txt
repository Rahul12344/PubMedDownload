lumpy skin disease (lsd) one major livestock disease problems most
areas ethiopia. questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted from
october 2011 february 2012 four selected districts afar tigray
regions estimate herd-level prevalence lsd, assess its
associated risk factors. herd-owners selected based willingness to
provide information complete questionnaire. total 393 questionnaires 
were collected. 393 herd-owners, 173 reported lsd herds,
giving estimated herd- animal-level prevalence (44%, 95% ci: 37-50%)
and (7.4%, 95% ci: 6-8%), respectively. herd prevalence regions among
the districts significantly different (χ(2)=8, p<0.01 χ(2)=9.9, p<0.01),
respectively. risk factors lsd occurrence introduction new
animal herd, herd size, utilization communal grazing watering
points. management characteristics cannot readily changed studied
area, hence, disease control rely greater use effective lsd
vaccines.
