little known response deep-sea virus relationship 
their host towards environmental change. although viruses thought play key
roles deep-sea ecological evolution biogeochemical cycling, these
roles yet defined. study aims delineate relationship
between deep-sea filamentous phage sw1 host shewanella piezotolerans
(s. piezotolerans) wp3, response towards temperature change. copy
number sw1's replicative form (rf-) dna single-stranded (ss-) dna along
the different growth phases wp3 quantified 20°c 4°c, respectively.
the copy number sw1 rf-dna found temperature growth
phase-dependent, ssdna sw1 produced 4°c. the
first report showing low-temperature dependence phage dna replication. the
transcription sw1 key genes fpsa fpsr also found induced low
temperature monitored growth periods wp3. additionally, the
transcription sw1 found induced cold-shock dna
replication changed. data demonstrates dynamic change virus dna 
replication transcription accordance host growth, low
temperature adapted mechanisms sw1 activities deep sea. low
temperature adapted deep-sea virus-bacterium system could serve ideal model
to study mechanism relationship deep-sea virus-bacteria
ecosystems.
