the presence pathogen among multiple competing species important
ecological implications. example, pathogen may change competitive
outcome, resulting replacement native species non-native species.
alternately, pathogen becomes established, may drastic reduction 
in species numbers. stochastic variability birth, death pathogen
transmission processes plays important role determining success of
species pathogen invasion. investigate phenomena studying the
dynamics deterministic stochastic models n competing species a
shared pathogen. deterministic model system ordinary differential
equations n competing species single shared pathogen is
transmitted among n species. immunity infection, individuals
either die recover become immediately susceptible, sis disease model.
analytical results pathogen persistence extinction summarized for
the deterministic model two three species new results stability
of infection-free state invasion one species system n-1
species obtained. new stochastic models derived form of
continuous-time markov chains stochastic differential equations. branching
process theory applied continuous-time markov chain model estimate
probabilities pathogen extinction species invasion. finally, numerical
simulations conducted explore effect disease two-species
competition, illustrate analytical results highlight some
of differences stochastic deterministic models.
