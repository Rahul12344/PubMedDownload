objective: investigate effects adenovirus-mediated pten p27 
invasion pc-3 vitro angiogenesis, along synergy the
treatment prostate cancer.
methods: recombinant adenovirus vectors human tumor suppressor genes pten 
and p27 constructed. replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus 
packaged propagated hek293 cells. viral titer examined plaque
assay mrna protein expressions pten p27 human prostate
cancer cell line pc-3 infected ad-pten ad-p27 determined rt-pcr 
and western blot respectively. invasion pc-3 cells vitro examined
by boyden chamber assay. mtt assay used testify effect supernatant 
from pc-3 infected ad-pten ad-p27 proliferation endothelial
cells ecv-304 cam test used testify effect pten p27 
angiogenesis. difference combined therapy group single
gene therapy group also examined.
results: viral titers ad-pten ad-p27 1.8 x 10(7) pfu/ml 1.2 x
10(9) pfu/ml respectively. adenovirus infection verified mrna and
protein expression pten p27 steady human pc-3 cells. invasion 
in vitro pc-3 cells significantly inhibited infection ad-pten
or/and ad-p27. cam mtt assays ecv-304 confirmed supernatant 
pc-3 cells infected ad-pten or/and ad-p27 could inhibit angiogenesis
effectively. significant difference combined therapy
group single gene therapy group.
conclusion: combined gene therapy ad-pten ad-p27 plays synergistic
role inhibiting invasiveness pc-3 cells angiogenesis.
