aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotes represent highly diverse groups (green, red,
and chromalveolate algae) derived multiple endosymbiosis events, covering 
wide spectrum tree life. responsible 50% the
global photosynthesis serve foundation oceanic fresh water
food webs. although ecophysiology molecular ecology algal species
are extensively studied, basic aspects algal cell biology still
underexplored. recent wealth genomic resources algae opened new
frontiers decipher role cell signaling pathways function in
an ecological biotechnological context. here, took bioinformatic
approach explore distribution conservation tor and
autophagy-related (atg) proteins (atg yeast) diverse algal groups. our
genomic analysis demonstrates conservation tor atg proteins green
algae. contrast, 5 available red algal genomes, could detect the
sequences encode 17 core atg proteins examined, albeit tor
and interacting proteins conserved. intriguing data suggests that
the autophagy pathway conserved red algae entire
eukaryote domain. contrast, chromalveolates, despite derived the
red-plastid lineage, retain express atg genes, raises fundamental
question regarding acquisition atg genes algal evolution. among
chromalveolates, emiliania huxleyi (haptophyta), bloom-forming coccolithophore,
possesses complete set atg genes, may serve model organism
to study autophagy marine protists great ecological significance.
