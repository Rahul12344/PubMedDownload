infection hela cells poliovirus leads rapid shut-off host cell
transcription rna polymerase ii. previous results suggested the
basal transcription factor tbp (tata-binding protein) transcription activator
proteins creb (cyclic amp-responsive element-binding protein) oct-1
(the octamer-binding factor) cleaved viral-encoded protease, 3c(pro). 
here demonstrate transcriptional activator (and tumor suppressor) p53
is degraded viral protease 3c vivo vitro. unlike other
transcription factors directly cleaved 3c(pro), degradation p53
requires hela cell activity addition 3c(pro). degradation p53 by
3c(pro) appear involve ubiquitin pathway protein degradation. 
vaccinia virus infection hela cells leads inactivation cellular
activity required 3c(pro)-mediated degradation p53. vaccinia-encoded
protein (crma) known inhibit caspase (ice protease) converts
inactive il-1beta active secreted form. incubation hela cells with
caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk interfere 3c(pro)-mediated
degradation p53. cellular activity present extracts hela cells can
be fractionated phosphocellulose. partially purified fraction that
elutes 0.6 kcl phosphocellulose contains activity degrades p53
in 3c(pro)-dependent manner. results suggest poliovirus-encoded
protease 3c(pro) cellular activity required degradation p53 
observed cells infected poliovirus.
