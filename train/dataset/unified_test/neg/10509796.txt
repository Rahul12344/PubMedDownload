the expression transcriptionally active nerve growth factor-induced gene-b
(ngfi-b) rapidly induced thyroid follicular cells response camp
stimulation. transcription thyrocyte-specific genes controlled by
the camp cascade, investigated possible involvement ngfi-b this
control. recombinant adenoviruses driving expression either intact
ngfi-b protein truncated form lacks capacity transactivate
a nbre-dependent promoter, used infect dog thyrocytes maintained in
primary culture. northern blot analysis total rna infected cells revealed
that expression ngfi-b sufficient induce significant
accumulation specific transcripts (thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase,
sodium-iodide symporter) unstimulated thyrocytes. overproduction the
transcriptionally inactive form ngfi-b thyrocytes maintained the
presence forskolin infection impair accumulation the
thyroid-specific transcripts. data show ngfi-b control the
expression differentiation thyrocytes acting canonical nbre.
as consequence, must consider either expression ngfi-b in
camp-stimulated thyrocytes critically linked expression of
differentiation ngfi-b implicated regulatory mechanism which
differs known action level nbre.
