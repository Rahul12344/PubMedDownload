this study analyzed vivo antiviral cellular immune reactions shope
rabbit papilloma-carcinoma model. antigens studied experimentally infected
domestic rabbits cottontail rabbit papillomavirus particles produced with
the athymic (nu/nu) mouse xenograft system bacterial fusion proteins
containing major minor capsid protein. recall reactions antigens were
tested classic intracutaneous tests. positive reactions biphasic course.
histopathology skin test biopsy specimens showed infiltrating
polymorphonuclear cells early stages. later replaced by
predominantly perivascular infiltrates composed mononuclear cells. time course
of swelling infiltrates resembled delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.
ten 11 regressor rabbits (p = 0.00006) 10 20 progressors (p = 0.009)
had positive skin tests intact and/or denaturated virus particles and
individual capsid proteins also could elicit specific skin reactions. skin
reactivity cottontail rabbit papillomavirus particles also greater (p 
= 0.042) regressor rabbits (8 11) compared progressors (7 20).
recall reactions remained detectable post-regression times, ranging from
several months 2 years. conclude specific skin reactions 
against cottontail rabbit papillomavirus infected domestic rabbits exist, 
and strongly positive intact particles papillomavirus animals
(regressors) clinically free disease.
