no specific vaccine west nile virus (wnv) currently available human
use. present study, describe generation wnv-like particles
(wnv-lps) insect cells use recombinant baculoviruses expressing wnv 
structural proteins prme cprme. balb/c mice immunized purified wnv-lps
developed wnv-specific antibodies potent neutralizing activities. mice
immunized prme-like particles (prme-lps) showed morbidity mortality
after challenge wnv. immunization prme-lps induce sterilizing
immunity without producing evidence viremia viral rna spleen 
brain. results suggest wnv-lps hold promise vaccine candidate for
wnv infection.
