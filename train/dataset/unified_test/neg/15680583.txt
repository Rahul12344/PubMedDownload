understanding factors influencing stability protein mutants an
important task molecular computational biology. work, have
approached problem examining relative importance secondary
structure solvent accessibility mutant residue for
understanding/predicting stability protein mutants. used
hydrophobic, electrostatic hydrogen bond free energy terms nine unique
physicochemical, energetic conformational properties amino acids the
present study parameters related changes thermal
stability (deltatm) single mutants lysozymes based single and
multiple correlation coefficients. expected properties reflecting
hydrophobicity hydrophobic free energy play major role distinguish
stabilizing destabilizing mutants. hydrophobic free energy due carbon 
and nitrogen atoms distinguish stability coil strand mutations 
accuracy 100 90%, respectively. agreement previous results, the
subgroup classification based secondary structure information about
its location structure yielded good relationship experimental
deltatm. revealed secondary structure information equally 
important solvent accessibility understanding stability protein
mutants. comparison amino acid properties free-energy terms indicate 
that energetic contribution explains mutant stability better coil
region whereas amino acid properties better strand region. further, the
combination free energies amino acid properties increased correlation
significantly. present study demonstrates importance classifying the
mutants based secondary structure stability proteins upon mutations.
