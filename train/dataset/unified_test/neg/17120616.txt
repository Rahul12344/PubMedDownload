in many studies, erbb4 expression breast tumor samples correlates a
favorable patient prognosis. similarly, erbb4 signaling coupled cellular
differentiation growth arrest variety model systems. however, some
studies, erbb4 expression breast tumor samples correlates poor outcome.
likewise, studies using human mammary tumor cell lines suggest erbb4 is
coupled malignant phenotypes. thus, roles erbb4 plays human breast
cancer still poorly defined. demonstrate constitutively active
erbb4 mutant (erbb4-q646c) inhibits colony formation plastic two human
mammary tumor cell lines (skbr3 mcf7) mcf10a immortalized human
mammary cell line, inhibit colony formation mda-mb-453 and
t47d human mammary tumor cell lines. erbb4 kinase activity necessary erbb4
function phosphorylation erbb4 tyr1056 necessary appears be
sufficient erbb4 function. inhibition colony formation mcf10a cells
is accompanied growth arrest cell death. data suggest erbb4
behaves mammary tumor suppressor loss erbb4 coupling growth
arrest may important event mammary tumorigenesis.
