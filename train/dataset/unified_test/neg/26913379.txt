objective: characterize risk liver-related events death in
hepatitis b virus (hbv)-exposed liver transplantation (lt) recipients.
methods: retrospective review performed adults underwent lt
between january 1995 december 2010 johns hopkins hospital.
recipients graft failure death within 14 lt missing hbv status
were excluded, leaving 575 individuals analysis. patients classified
according hbv exposure status: unexposed, resolved hbv, chronic hbv, or
hepatitis b core antibody (anti-hbc) seropositive liver donor.
results: compared hbv-unexposed patients, relative hazard combined
liver-related events (rejection, cirrhosis, re-transplantation) death after
lt increased patients baseline history resolved hbv
infection chronic hepatitis b. using anti-hbc seropositive donors also not
increase risk liver-related events, death, composite events (all p ≥
0.05). however, hepatitis c associated liver-related events [adjusted
hazard ratio (ahr), 1.59; 95% confidence interval (ci), 1.00-2.52], blacks
had higher risk death (ahr, 1.50; 95% ci, 1.01-2.22).
conclusion: lt patients prior hbv exposure use anti-hbc
seropositive donors associated increased risk liver-related events
or death.
