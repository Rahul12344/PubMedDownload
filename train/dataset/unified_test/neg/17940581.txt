we examine action natural selection periodically changing environment
where two competing strains specialists respectively environmental
state. relative fitness strains subject general
class frequency-dependent selection, show coexistence rather than
extinction likely outcome. coexistence may stable periodic
equilibrium, stable limit cycles varying lengths, deterministically
chaotic. model applicable population dynamics commonly found in
many types viruses.
