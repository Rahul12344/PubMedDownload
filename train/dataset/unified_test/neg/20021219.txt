recombinant vectors based adeno-associated virus (raav) promising tools to
specifically alter complex genomes homologous recombination (hr)-based
gene targeting. therapeutic setting, aav donor vector recombine with
a mutant target locus order correct mutation directly genome.
the low frequency hr mammalian cells significantly improved by
insertion dna double-strand break (dsb) target locus through
expression site-specific endonuclease. here, scrutinized fate of
raav vector genomes dsb-induced gene targeting assessed targeting

cell lines carrying mutated enhanced green fluorescent protein locus a

raav-mediated gene targeting, also great potential precise genome
