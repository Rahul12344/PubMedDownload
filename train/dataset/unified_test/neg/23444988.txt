cryo electron microscopy (cryo-em) data interior phages show ordering
of interior dna interpreted nearly perfectly ordered
polymer. show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, electrostatic
forces sufficient predict major features current
structural data dna packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering
due elastic bending forces polymer. current models assume
highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on
interpretation cryo-em density maps. show herein surface induced
packing short (6mer), unconnected dna polymer segments necessary
ingredient creating ringed densities consistent experimental density
maps. implies ensemble possible conformations polymeric dna within
the capsid consistent cryo-em data may much larger implied 
by traditional interpretations rings result from
highly-ordered spool-like conformations. opens possibility more

elastic anomalies might reduce overall elastic bending enthalpy more
