this first population-based study non- hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) region 
in pakistan, provides overview incidence pattern time trends in
karachi generates hypotheses future experimental research.
epidemiological data 429 incident (1(st) jan 1995 31(st) dec 2002),
microscopically verified nodal extra-nodal nhl cases, registered the
karachi cancer registry (kcr) karachi south, reviewed. age
standardized incidence rate (asir) 5.3/100,000 males (m) 4.1/100,000
in females (f), 1995. gradual increase annual incidence observed 
during study period, nhl incidence rate increasing 2002 to
8.4/100,000 men 6.5/100,000 women, almost double 1995 rates. nhl
affected age groups genders group asir higher
among men women, overall gender ratio 1.9. mean ages the
patients 41.5 years (95% ci 39.1; 43.8) males 44.0 years (95% ci
40.8; 47.1) females. adult childhood ratios 8.6 (m) 10.7 (f). 
b-cell nhl comprised 81.0% nhl males 87.3% females. one fourth of
the nhl cases extra-nodal, largest group gastrointestinal origin 
(54.1% m, 38.5% f). gastric component 21% 25.6% f. odds ratios 
sex, age-groups, ethnicity, religion, subdivision socio-economic
categories calculated considering malignancies, except
lymphoproliferative disorders controls. odds ratio (or) men 2.2
(95% ci 0.6; 3.0). children adolescents highest risk of
developing nhl, especially 5-9 year olds, genders. marginally
higher risk observed lower socioeconomic categories for
ethnicities belonging northern north western pakistan (punjabi, pushtu and
baluch) residing karachi south. incidence rates nhl registered in
karachi south likely reflection non-aids-associated nhl. estimated
hiv/aids incidence low study period population have
an impact nhl incidence. preponderance low intermediate grade
lymphomas, paucity central nervous system nhl higher childhood nhl
component support hypothesis. yet unpublished reports, however, are
raising alarm rising hiv positivity. nhl correlation hiv/aids status 
and studies identifying risk factors non- hiv/aids associated nhl (childhood
viral infections, hepatitis c virus, helicobacter pylori) potential areas
for future experimental epidemiological research.
