six deletion mutations insertion generated env gene cloned 
copies moloney murine leukemia virus dna. seven mutants were
replication-defective tested transformation nih/3t3 cells. mutant
dnas introduced nih/3t3 cells generate stable producer lines; all
released virion particles medium, suggesting none mutations 
affected overall viral gene expression, gag pol gene expression, gag pol 
gene functions, virion budding. several mutations reduced lifetime 
of env protein blocked export cell surface. one mutation
altering membrane-spanning region cytoplasmic tail tm protein 
had effect export protein, proteolytic processing, incorporation 
into virion particles, still blocked infectivity resulting virus. 
the results suggest alterations transmembrane region affect early
steps infection, fusion virion host membranes. cells
expressing mutant env protein fully resistant superinfection by
wild-type virus. thus, induction virus resistance, presumably reflecting
blocking virus receptor, separated virus infectivity.
