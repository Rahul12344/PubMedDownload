chicken infectious anaemia virus (ciav) economically important highly
immunosuppressive virus affecting poultry industry worldwide. study we
assessed immunomodulatory effects four herbal preparations namely withania
somnifera, tinospora cordifolia, azadirachta indica e care se herbal in
resisting viral multiplication immunosuppression inflicted ciav in
chicks. day-old chicks (n = 90) randomly equally divided six groups
(groups a-f). groups a-d administered purified extracts w.
somnifera, t. cordifolia, a. indica e care se herbal, respectively followed
by evaluation viral load lymphoid organs quantitative real-time pcr 
and cell mediated immune response flow cytometric analysis cd4+ cd8+ 
cells. groups a-d found resist ciav multiplication pathogenesis 
significant reduction viral load compared infected control
(p < 0.05). group a-c chicks showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) cd4+ cd8+
t cell counts compared control birds e care se herb minimal
effect cell count. findings suggested herbal preparations used 
during study effective prophylactic immunomodulatory agents 
and thus potential used ciav induced immunosuppression in
poultry.
