purpose review: enter fourth decade hiv epidemic, advances in
understanding hiv pathogenesis development potent safer antiretroviral
drugs spectacular. 30 antiviral drugs registered
and impact combination antiviral therapy morbidity mortality has
been dramatic. however, despite long-term virus suppression, hiv invariably
rebounds interruption therapy. long-term antiviral therapy cure
hiv infection induce restoration/development virus-specific immune
responses capable controlling hiv replication. therefore, development of
immune-based interventions needed restore effective defenses lead 
to hiv functional cure ultimately eradication.
recent findings: therapeutic vaccination immune interventions generate
de-novo boost preexisting hiv-specific t-cell responses being
investigated potential means achieve 'functional hiv cure'. one major
hurdle quest hiv cure control elimination hiv latent
reservoir. several immune interventions target latent reservoir have
been tried recent years. parallel, several therapeutic vaccination
strategies developed tested early clinical studies. recent
encouraging studies show first time vaccination impact
on hiv load.
summary: review summarizes main immune interventions evaluated 
last years. ways improve them, well challenges monitoring/evaluating 
effects strategies, discussed. addition, clinical efficacy
and potential clinical benefits immunotherapeutic interventions are
particularly difficult measure. review highlights current assays used and
their shortcoming.
