west nile virus (wnv) emerging arbovirus, circulating worldwide between
birds mosquitoes, impacts human animal health. since mid-1990s,
wnv outbreaks emerged europe america represent currently the
primary cause encephalitis united states. wnv exhibits great genetic 
diversity least eight different lineages circulating world, and
four (1, 2, koutango, putative new) present africa. different
wnv lineages readily differentiated serology, thus, rapid
molecular tools required diagnostic. developed real-time rt-pcr
assays detection genotyping african wnv lineages. specificity of
the assays tested using flaviviruses circulating africa. the
sensitivity determined testing serial 10-fold dilutions viruses rna
standards. assays provided good specificity sensitivity the
analytical detection limit 10 copies/reaction. rt-pcr assays allowed 
detection genotyping wnv isolates culture medium, human serum, 
vertebrate tissues, well field experimental mosquito samples.
comparing ratios genome copy number/infectious virion (plaque-forming
units), study finally revealed new insight replication these
different wnv lineages mosquito cells. rt-pcr assays first ones
allowing genotyping wnv african variants, may important 
applications surveillance epidemiology africa also monitoring
of emergence europe continents.
