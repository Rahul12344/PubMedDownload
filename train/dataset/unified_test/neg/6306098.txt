forty ponies immunized inactivated virus vaccine containing
a/equine/miami/63 (h3n8) virus six unvaccinated, seronegative ponies were
experimentally challenged representative recent equine h3n8 virus
isolates, a/equine/newmarket/79. unvaccinated ponies became infected as
judged virus excretion, febrile responses antibody responses, two
of vaccinated ponies fully protected. pre-challenge antibody levels to
a/newmarket/79 virus detected single radial haemolysis (srh) correlated well
with degree clinical protection levels required complete
protection (srh zones greater 65 mm2) high. importance these
results relation conventional vaccination procedures equine
influenza discussed.
