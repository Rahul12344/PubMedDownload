homologs transcription factor leafy (lfy) f-box family member
unusual floral organs (ufo) found promote floral meristem identity
across diverse dicot model systems. lower eudicot model aquilegia produces
cymose inflorescences independently evolved well-studied cymose
models petunia tomato. previously characterized expression
pattern aquilegia homolog aqlfy current study, add
expression data two ufo homologs, aqufo1 2, conduct virus-induced 
gene silencing loci. down-regulation aqlfy aqufo1 2 not
eliminate floral meristem identity but, instead, causes transition from
inflorescence floral identity become gradual rather discrete.
inflorescences down-regulated plants generate several nodes bract/sepal
chimeras and, floral development commence, flowers initiate several
whorls sepals finally producing wildtype floral whorls. in
addition, silencing aqufo1/2 appears specifically impact petal identity
and/or initiation petal stamen whorls. general, however, is
no evidence essential role aqlfy aqufo1/2 transcriptional
activation b c gene homologs. findings highlight differences
between deeply divergent dicot lineages functional conservation the
floral meristem identity program.
