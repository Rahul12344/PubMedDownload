mer+ hela s3 tumor cells high levels o6-methylguanine-dna
methyltransferase (mgmt) gene expression transduced retroviral-mediated
mgmt antisense rna. mgmt mrna, mgmt protein, mgmt activity transduced 
cells 28.7%, 32.7%, 39. 1% hela s3 cells, respectively. 
the transduced cells showed sensitive acnu hela s3 cells in
cell survival nude mice experiments. pathologic examination confirmed that
transduced grafts killed acnu. results suggested mgmt gene
expression could modulated retroviral-mediated antisense rna mer+ 
tumor drug resistance acnu could reversed modulation mgmt gene
expression.
