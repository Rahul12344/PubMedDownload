background: hepatitis b virus (hbv) causes acute chronic liver injury.
viral proteins involved pathological progress. hepatitis b core
antigen (hbcag), component viral nucleocapsid, essential hbv
lifecycle, also exhibits strong immunogenicity. cytoplasmic location of
hbcag liver biopsy associated liver injury inflammation, the
exact mechanisms remain elaborated.
methods: huh7, smmc-7721 l-02 cells transfected pegfp-n1-hbcag to
establish intracellular hbcag expression model. mrna protein levels of
interleukin (il)-6 detected qpcr elisa respectively. signaling
pathway-related proteins investigated western blot immunofluorescence
assay.
results: hbcag increased expression secretion il-6 activating 
extracellular signal-related kinase (erk), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38 mapk) nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb). activations blocked
by specific inhibitors three pathways.
conclusions: hbcag actives p38, erk1/2 nf-κb enhance production of
il-6 hepatocytes. provides molecular mechanism explain the
association cytoplasmic hbcag severe liver injury inflammation.
