background: human liver alters aging. lower serum albumin elevation 
serum cholesterol alkaline phosphatase (alp) reported elders,
but report old people (i.e., >75 y/o). we
evaluated changes liver biochemical tests hepatitis b virus (hbv)
serological markers old-aged population.
methods: october 1993 june 1994, 2,549 subjects attended hospital for
physical check-up. 1,742 healthy subjects (m/f = 1,058/648) were
enrolled analysis normal range liver biochemical tests different
age groups. divided four groups; young-aged group (age 18 
and 40, n = 231), middle-aged group (age 41 64, n = 991), old-aged
group (age 65 75, n = 424), old-aged group (age > = 76, n
= 96). items liver biochemical tests included albumin, total bilirubin,
cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast),
alp gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt). whole population, totally 2,549 
subjects, used analysis prevalence hbv serological markers
in different age groups.
results: serum albumin biochemical parameter persisted to
decline age 75 (p <0.05). cholesterol began elevate the
middle-age decreased 75 y/o. old-aged old-aged subjects
had higher levels serum bilirubin, ast, alp, ggt levels two
groups (p <0.05), however, changes alt levels among groups 
so remarkable. hbv carrier rates young-aged, middle-aged, old-aged and
the old-aged groups 16.8%, 12.3%, 6.8% 7.0%, respectively (p
<0.001). furthermore, old-aged group significantly higher
prevalence negativity hbsag anti-hbs (p <0.001).
conclusions: serum albumin biochemical parameter persists to
decline age 75. contrast, elevation cholesterol tends to
reverse age. aging-related changes biochemical tests are
clinically nonsignificant though significant statistical
analysis. addition, low hbv carrier rate high prevalence negativity
in hbsag anti-hbs noted old-aged people, possibly due to
the progressive loss hbv markers elders.
