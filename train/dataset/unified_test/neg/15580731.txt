scope problem: among u.s. women, breast cancer commonly
diagnosed cancer remains second lung cancer cause of
cancer-related mortality. american cancer society (acs) estimates that
182,800 new cases female breast cancer 41,200 deaths breast cancer
will occur 2000. since 1950s, incidence invasive cervical cancer
and mortality disease decreased substantially; much decline
is attributed widespread use papanicolaou (pap) test. acs estimates
that 12,800 new cases invasive cervical cancer diagnosed, 4,600
deaths disease occur united states 2000.
etiologic factors: risk breast cancer increases advancing age; other
risk factors include personal family history breast cancer, certain benign 
breast diseases, early age menarche, late age menopause, white race,
nulliparity, igher socioeconomic status. risk factors cervical cancer
include certain human papilloma virus infections, early age first intercourse,
multiple male sex partners, history sexually transmitted diseases, low
socioeconomic status. black, hispanic, american indian racial/ethnic
background considered risk factor cervical cancer detection and
death rates higher among women.
recommendations prevention: studies etiology breast cancer 
have failed identify feasible primary prevention strategies suitable use
in general population, reducing mortality breast cancer early
detection become high priority. potential reducing death rates from
breast cancer contingent increasing mammography screening rates and
subsequently detecting disease early stage--when treatment options
are available survival rates higher. effective control cervical cancer
depends primarily early detection precancerous lesions use the
papanicolaou test, followed timely evaluation treatment. thus, the
intended outcome cervical cancer screening differs breast cancer 
screening. 1991, national breast cervical cancer early detection
program (nbccedp) implemented increase breast cervical cancer
screening among uninsured, low-income women.
research agenda: support recommended priority activities nbccedp, cdc 
developed research agenda comprising six priorities. six priorities are
a) determining effective strategies communicate changes nbccedp policy to
cancer screening providers women enrolled program; b) identifying
effective strategies increase proportion enrolled women complete
routine breast cervical cancer rescreening according nbccedp policy; c)
identifying effective strategies increase nbccedp enrollment among eligible
women never received breast cervical cancerscreening; d) evaluating
variations clinical practice patterns among providers nbccedp screening
services; e) determining optimal models providing case-management services to
women nbccedp abnormal screening result, precancerous breast or
cervical lesion, diagnosis cancer; f) conducting economic analyses to
determine costs providing screening services nbccedp.
conclusion: nbccedp, federal, state, territorial, tribal
governments, collaboration national community-based organizations,
has increased access breast cervical cancer screening among low-income and
uninsured women. initiative enabled united states make substantial
progress toward achieving healthy people 2000 objectives breast and
cervical cancer control among racial/ethnic minorities persons are
medically underserved. continuing challenge future increase
national commitment providing screening services eligible uninsured
women ultimately reduce morbidity mortality breast cervical
cancer.
