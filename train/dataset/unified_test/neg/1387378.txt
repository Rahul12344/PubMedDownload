chimeric proteins escherichia coli histone-like hu ihf were
constructed genetic engineering, part arm region replaced 
by corresponding region ihf alpha (designated hupanhima) ihf beta
(hupanhimd); alternatively, alpha-helix 2-beta 1 region replaced the
corresponding region ihf alpha (hupaxhima) ihf beta (hupaxhimd) (symbols n 
and x indicate noti xhoi junctions). proteins synthesized a
hupa-hupb double-deletion mutant. hupanhima exhibited marked reduction in
nonspecific dna binding vitro, drastic loss hu activity in
replicative transposition mu phage vivo. hupanhimd also showed a
significant reduction ability dna binding, though protein
supported mu phage development. contrast, two chimeric hu proteins
showed slight changes nonspecific dna-binding ability: retained
activities transposition mu phage vivo. observations confirm that
the flexible arm hu-2, domain proposed dna binding [tanaka et al.,
nature 310 (1984) 376-381; goshima et al., gene 96 (1990) 141-145], plays an
important role physiological function protein. results
indicate unique conformation arm structure hu protein,
particularly n-terminal half two-strand antiparallel beta-ribbon 
structure, important dna-binding ability protein.
