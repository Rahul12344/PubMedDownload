vaccinia topoisomerase forms covalent protein-dna intermediate 5'-ccctt
downward arrow sites duplex dna. downward arrow nucleotide linked via
a 3'-phosphodiester bond tyr-274 enzyme. here, report mutant
enzymes containing glutamate, cysteine histidine lieu tyr-274 catalyze
endonucleolytic cleavage 60 bp duplex dna ccctt downward arrow site
to yield 3' phosphate-terminated product. cys-274 mutant forms trace levels
of covalent protein-dna complex, suggesting dna cleavage reaction may 
proceed cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. however, his-274 and
glu-274 mutants evince detectable accumulation covalent protein-dna
adduct. glu-274 active mutants tested. ph dependence of
the endonuclease activity glu-274 (optimum ph = 6.5) distinct 
the wild-type enzyme hydrolysis covalent adduct (optimum ph = 9.5). 
ph 6.5, glu-274 endonuclease reaction slower 5-6 orders magnitude
than rate covalent adduct formation wild-type topoisomerase, is
approximately 20 times faster rate hydrolysis wild-type
covalent adduct. discuss two potential mechanisms account apparent 
conversion topoisomerase endonuclease.
