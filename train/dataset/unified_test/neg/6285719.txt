to 5.0 mg/kg followed continuously infused acyclovir 7.2, 14.4, 21.6, 28.8,
36.0, 43.2 mg/kg per day. mean serum plateau levels acyclovir
determined radioimmunoassay ranged 4.1 microm 7.2 mg/kg per day
dosage 36.6 microm 43.2 mg/kg per day dose. mean 75 percent of
acyclovir administered recovered urine patients treated. eleven 
13 patients varicella-zoster virus (vzv) infections new vesicle
formation three days acyclovir treatment patients ceased have
new vesicles five days therapy. nine patients complete
viral cultures available, six ceased shed virus three days, viral 
shedding ceased five days patients treated acyclovir. clinical
