background: incidence human papillomavirus (hpv)-related oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (opscc) rising recent years. given the
clinical impact hpv/p16 positivity opscc, identifying surrogate markers 
this disease early diagnostic work-up patients could improve
patient care.
methods: demographic, pathologic, staging pet-ct data patients diagnosed
with opscc 2009-2014 obtained prospectively collected provincial
cancer registry. tumor hpv/p16 status correlated maximum standard
uptake value (suvmax) primary tumor cervical nodes. comparisons of
means multinomial regression models used determine associations
between p16 status suvmax. diagnostic odds ratio calculated using cut
off value predicting hpv/p16 positivity based nodal suvmax.
results: pet-ct hpv/p16 data obtained 65 patients treated surgically 
for opscc. significantly higher nodal suvmax associated hpv/p16 positive
nodes (suvmax 10.8 vs 7.9). significant differences seen hpv/p16 
positive vs negative primary tumor suvmax (10.3 vs 13.7). combination with
other clinical parameters, higher nodal suvmax highly correlated hpv/p16
positivity.
conclusion: elevated nodal suvmax significant predictor hpv/p16 positive 
disease.
