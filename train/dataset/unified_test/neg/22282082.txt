herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection usually observed oral cavity and
external genitals, hsv peritonitis extremely rare. herein, report a
case type ii hsv peritonitis successfully diagnosed ascitic cytology. a
66-year-old japanese man, treated steroid inhalation 5
years due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, suspected acute
cholecystitis. laparoscopic cholecystectomy intraoperative cytological
examination ascitic fluid performed. cytological study ascitic fluid
revealed abundant granular cell debris, degenerative cells apoptotic
bodies present, well single multinucleated cells ground
glass nuclei. however, vivid mesothelial cells rarely seen.
immunocytochemical staining type ii hsv positive single or
multinucleated cells ground glass nuclei. therefore, diagnosis type ii 
hsv peritonitis made. first reported case type ii hsv
peritonitis successfully diagnosed ascitic cytology. report highlights
that presence abundant cell debris, degenerative cells apoptotic
bodies, absence vivid mesothelial cells key cytological
findings suspect hsv peritonitis, diagnosis confirmed by
careful surveillance characteristic nuclear findings single or
multinucleated cells. frequency opportunistic infection increased
because increased numbers iatrogenic immunocompromised patients seen
in case, therefore, cytological examination useful method early
detection causative agent peritonitis including hsv.
