we previously showed (v. w. raymond j. t. parsons, virology 160:400-410,
1987) variants prague strain rous sarcoma virus containing large
deletions impinging region src gene encoding amino acid residues 143 
to 169 defective transformation chicken cells culture. we
report introduction small (tri-and tetrapeptide) deletions region 
of pp60v-src containing amino acid residues 155 175 found inactivate
transformation. addition, insertion four, one, amino acid residues 
at position 161 also inhibited transformation. biochemical analysis src
proteins encoded individual transformation-defective variants revealed that
the structural alterations introduced domain marginal effects 
upon src tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. however, src proteins
encoded defective variants exhibited significantly shorter half-life within 
the cell, although proteins efficiently rapidly associated with
cellular membranes. results suggest structural domain encompassing
residues 155 177 may influence stability pp60src cellular
membrane, possibly via interaction src cellular membrane
component(s) substrate(s).
