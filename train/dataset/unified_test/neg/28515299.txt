understanding diversity consequences viruses present honey bees 
critical maintaining pollinator health managing spread disease.
the viral landscape honey bees (apis mellifera) changed dramatically since
the emergence parasitic mite varroa destructor, increased spread
of virulent variants viruses deformed wing virus. previous genomic
studies focused colonies suffering infections varroa virulent
viruses, could mask viral species present honey bees, resulting in
a distorted view viral diversity. capture viral diversity within
colonies exposed mites suffer ultimate consequences of
the infestation, examined populations honey bees evolved
naturally selected resistance varroa analysis revealed
seven novel viruses isolated honey bees sampled globally, including the
first identification negative-sense rna viruses honey bees. notably, two
rhabdoviruses present three geographically diverse locations were
also present varroa mites parasitizing bees. characterize antiviral
response, performed deep sequencing small rna populations honey bees and
mites. provided evidence dicer-mediated immune response honey bees, 
while viral small rna profile varroa mites novel distinct the
response observed bees. overall, show viral diversity honey bee
colonies greater previously thought, encourages additional studies 
of bee virome global scale may ultimately improve disease
management.importance honey bee populations become increasingly susceptible 
to colony losses due pathogenic viruses spread parasitic varroa mites. to
date, 24 viruses described honey bees, belonging the
order picornavirales collapsing varroa-infected colonies often overwhelmed
with high levels picornaviruses. examine underlying viral diversity 
honey bees, employed viral metatranscriptomics analyses three
geographically diverse varroa-resistant populations europe, africa, 
pacific. describe seven novel viruses range diverse viral families, 
including two viruses present three locations. honey bees,
small rna sequences indicate viruses processed dicer the
rna interference pathway, whereas varroa mites produce strikingly novel small rna
patterns. work increases number diversity known honey bee viruses
and ultimately contribute improved disease management most
important agricultural pollinator.
