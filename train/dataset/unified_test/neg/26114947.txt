uncontrolled immune responses intracellular dna shown induce
autoimmune diseases. homeostasis regulation immune responses cytosolic dna 
is critical limiting risk autoimmunity survival host. here,
we report e3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 30α (trim30α) was
induced herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infection dendritic cells
(dcs). knockdown genetic ablation trim30α augmented type ifns and
interleukin-6 response intracellular dna dna viruses. trim30α-deficient
mice resistant infection dna viruses. biochemical analyses showed
that trim30α interacted stimulator interferon genes (sting), is
a critical regulator dna-sensing response. overexpression trim30α
promoted degradation sting via k48-linked ubiquitination lys275 through
a proteasome-dependent pathway. findings indicate e3 ligase trim30α is
an important negative-feedback regulator innate immune responses dna
viruses targeting sting.
