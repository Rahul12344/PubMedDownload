in dark, plant seedlings follow skotomorphogenetic developmental program,
which results hypocotyl cell elongation. seedlings exposed to
light, switch photomorphogenetic development occurs, hypocotyl cell
elongation inhibited. manipulated expression atpgp1 (for
arabidopsis thaliana p glycoprotein1) gene transgenic arabidopsis plants by
using sense antisense constructs. show within certain light fluence
rate window, overexpression atpgp1 gene control the
cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter causes plants develop longer hypocotyls,
whereas expression gene antisense orientation results hypocotyls
shorter occurring wild type. dark, hypocotyls of
transgenic wild-type plants indistinguishable. atpgp1 gene
encodes member superfamily atp binding cassette-containing (abc)
transporters, results imply transport process involved a
hypocotyl cell elongation pathway active light. atpgp1 transporter 
localized plasmalemma, indicated immunohistochemical techniques 
biochemical membrane separation methods. analysis atpgp1 expression
pattern using reporter gene constructs situ hybridization shows in
wild-type seedlings, atpgp1 expressed root shoot apices.
