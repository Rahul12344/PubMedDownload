primary parvovirus b19 infection infrequent, serious treatable,
cause chronic anemia immunocompromised hosts. many compromised hosts have
preexisting antibody b19 risk. however, upon primary infection,
some patients may able mount sufficient immune response terminate
active parvovirus b19 infection erythroid precursors. common
consequence b19 infection compromised host pure red-cell aplasia,
resulting chronic recurrent anemia reticulocytopenia. anemia persists 
until neutralizing antibody either produced host passively
administered. parvovirus b19 suspected compromised hosts with
unexplained severe anemia reticulocytopenia, bone-marrow
examination shows either giant pronormoblasts absence red-cell precursors. 
diagnosis established detection b19 dna serum absence igg
antibody b19. cases, igg antibody detected neutralizing.
anti-b19 igm may may present. therapy includes the
following: red-cell transfusion, adjustment medications restore improve 
the patient's immune system, administration intravenous immunoglobulin
(ivig). following treatment, patients closely monitored, especially 
immunosuppression unchanged increased. hematocrit trend downward and
parvovirus dna trend upward, therapeutic options revisited.
in instances, monthly maintenance ivig may indicated. caregivers 
be aware b19 variants, though rarely encountered, missed or
under-quantitated real-time polymerase-chain reaction methods.
