cystic fibrosis (cf) lung disease characterized chronic endobronchial
infection resulting progressive pulmonary destruction; major cause
of mortality morbidity. neutrophils primary effector cells
responsible progressive deterioration lung function.
peptido-leukotriene b4 antagonists, new anti-inflammatory agents block the
neutrophil-dominated inflammation, could potential long-term
use. trial pharmacokinetics amelubant administered orally single
dose 75 mg pediatric patients cf 300 mg adults, 
repeated dose 75 mg 150 mg, respectively, daily 15 days provided 
evidence amelubant metabolism adult pediatric patients cf is
similar healthy adults. another study using dosage
regimen, amelubant appeared safe well tolerated. safety measures
included physical examination, vital signs, spirometry, oximetry, ecg, and
clinical laboratory testing. however, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multinational, phase ii trial (boehringer ingelheim 543.45)
was conducted investigate clinical efficacy 24 weeks treatment 
amelubant patients cf mild-to-moderate lung disease. two doses of
amelubant (75 150 mg) tested adult patients (> = 18 years) one
dose amelubant (75mg) tested pediatric (6-17 years) patients. trial
was terminated early due statistically significant increase risk of
pulmonary-related, serious adverse events adults receiving amelubant.
cysteinyl leukotrienes, eosinophilic inflammation, viral infections also
contribute progressive pulmonary destruction cf. cysteinyl leukotrienes are
potential targets cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist use. study on
the pharmacokinetics montelukast children cf provided evidence that
the dose montelukast administration interval need be
modified goal mimic serum concentrations used treat asthma.
in randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, 16 children
with mild cf (median age 9.5 years; vital capacity [vc] >70%) treated with
montelukast (5 < =14 years; 5 mg; >14 years; 10 mg) placebo a
once-daily tablet 21 days. significant (p < = 0.02) reduction 
in serum eosinophil cationic protein levels eosinophils (p < = 0.027) with
montelukast. however, neither lung function tests (vc, forced expiratory volume
in 1 second [fev1], maximum expiratory flow 25% forced vc), clinical
symptom scores changed significantly. another study, 26 patients aged 6-18
years moderate cf (vc 40% 69% predicted) received montelukast or
placebo 8 weeks 20-week, randomized, double-blind, crossover,
placebo-controlled trial. treatment montelukast a
significant improvement fev1, peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow
between 25% 75%, significant decrease cough wheezing scale
scores (p < 0.001 all). montelukast treatment decreased serum sputum
levels eosinophil cationic protein interleukin-8 (il-8), decreased sputum 
levels myeloperoxidase, increased serum sputum levels il-10 (p <
0.001 all) compared placebo. date, clinical experience research
data anti-inflammatory effects leukotriene receptor antagonists cf
are limited. multicenter trials longer observation periods greater
patient numbers needed prove hypothesis leukotriene receptor
antagonists potential ameliorate cf lung disease long term use.
