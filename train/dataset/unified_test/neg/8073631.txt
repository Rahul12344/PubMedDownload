cdna clones corresponding mrna hemagglutinin the
hemagglutination-defective strain ak-1 measles virus isolated and
characterized. compared prototype edmonston strain, 60 nucleotide
substitutions resulted 18 amino acid changes detected. additional
potential n-linked glycosylation site added point mutation, was
supported observation hemagglutinin ak-1 strain was
stained heavily nadodso4-page periodic acid-schiff (pas) staining 
than edmonston strain. computer-assisted analysis revealed three reverse
turns secondary structure disappeared hemagglutinin ak-1
strain. moreover, one structural changes occurred closely
glycosylated region amino acid residues 168-240, appeared a
biologically important functional domain. isoelectric point calculated from
the predicted amino acid sequence became 1 ph unit basic ak-1
strain edmonston strain. present study first sequence
analysis hemagglutinin gene hemagglutination-defective strain 
measles virus.
