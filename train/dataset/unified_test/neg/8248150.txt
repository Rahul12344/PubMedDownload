the retroviral integrase protein (in) responsible catalyzing concerted
integration reaction two termini linear viral dna joined to
host dna. probe potential form protein multimers, used the
yeast two-hybrid system. coexpression gal4 dna binding domain-in fusion 
and gal4 activation domain-in fusion together resulted successful
activation gal4-responsive lacz reporter gene. system used to
examine variety deletion mutants. results suggest central
region protein necessary multimerization n-terminal
zinc finger region important.
