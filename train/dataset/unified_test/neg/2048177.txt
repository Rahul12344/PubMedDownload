detection antibodies human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) recently
infected donors crucial prevent transmission hiv infection via blood
products. determine whether specific antibodies iga igm class are
present markers recent infection donor specimens borderline
reactivity routine enzyme immunoassay (eia) screening, 15 specimens 
positive immunoblot tested iga igm hiv antibodies. 15 had
detectable iga hiv antibodies, 14 igm hiv antibodies. 15 specimens
were tested further, two independent laboratories, nine licensed
eias. two nine eias found 15 units positive laboratories;
seven eias found 1 5 15 units negative, total 31
false-negative results. results indicated difference the
sensitivity eia kits using anti-igg reagents kits using
multispecific reagents react igg classes antibody. a
modified procedure, addition enzyme-conjugated anti-iga anti-igm the
kit's enzyme-conjugated reagent increased optical density values most
false-negative specimens positive range. concluded licensed
kits vary reactivity iga igm hiv antibodies sensitivity
could increased improved detection classes antibody.
