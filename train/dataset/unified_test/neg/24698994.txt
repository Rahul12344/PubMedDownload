in current work, established characterized novel cell line from
rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). cell line, designated rth (rainbow
trout heart), obtained immortalizing heart cells recombinant
retroviruses transduced polyoma middle antigen. first time
such strategy used obtain immortalized fish cell line. cells
showed endothelial-like morphology characteristics, constitutively
transcribing collagen, selectin vcam (vascular cell adhesion molecule), as
well different chemokines chemokine receptors, cytokeratin. as
already described heart endothelial cells, rth cells actively phagocytized
latex beads. furthermore, rth cells showed high susceptibility viral
hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv). vhsv modulated transcription mx,
major histocompatibility complex ii (mhc-ii), vcam many chemokine 
chemokine receptors expressed cells. therefore, rth cells constitute 
excellent model study immune regulation endothelial cells fish and
their role leukocyte extravasation.
