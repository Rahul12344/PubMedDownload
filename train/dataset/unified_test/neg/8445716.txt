a vaccinia virus transient expression system used determine the
sindbis virus (sin) proteins and/or polyproteins necessary formation 
of active replication complexes and, particular, analyze role nsp4, 
the putative polymerase, versus p34 rna replication. generated vaccinia
virus recombinants cdna entire sin nonstructural coding
region well cdna copies individual nonstructural proteins (nsps) and
several intermediate polyproteins placed downstream promoter t7
rna polymerase encephalomyocarditis virus 5' untranslated region. the
proteins expressed vaccinia virus recombinants comigrate authentic
proteins synthesized sin-infected cells, polyproteins appear be
processed individual proteins correct size. examine the
replication efficiencies different protein combinations, vaccinia virus
recombinant designed express engineered substrate rna could serve
as template replication subgenomic mrna transcription sin nsps. 
expression entire sin nonstructural coding region resulted the
synthesis high levels genomic subgenomic rnas derived the
engineered template. rna replication could detected coexpression 
the four individual nsps, although proteins indistinguishable, terms 
of electrophoretic mobility, synthesized sin-infected cells.
coexpression polyproteins p12, p23, and/or p34 individual nsps also
did result detectable levels rna replication. however, p123 and
p34 coexpressed, efficient rna replication subgenomic mrna transcription
of substrate rna observed. coexpression nsp4 p123 resulted the
synthesis minus-strand rnas. studies show expression both
p123 p34 necessary establishment functional rna replication and
transcription complexes raise possibility polyproteins
themselves may functional components complexes. addition, these
data indicate nsp4 moiety expressed independently additional
n-terminal methionine capable functioning minus-strand not
plus-strand rna synthesis.
