in contrast prevailing view invertebrate immunity relies on
broad-spectrum recognition effector mechanisms, intrinsic genetic
compatibility invertebrate hosts pathogens often highly
specific nature. solving puzzle requires better understanding the
molecular basis underlying observed patterns invertebrate host-pathogen
genetic specificity, broadly referred genotype-by-genotype interactions.
here, identify invertebrate immune gene natural polymorphism is
associated isolate-specific resistance rna virus. dicer-2 (dcr2)
encodes key protein upstream rna interference (rnai) pathway, major
antiviral component innate immunity invertebrates. surveyed allelic
polymorphism dcr2 locus wild-type outbred population three
derived isofemale families mosquito aedes aegypti experimentally
exposed several, genetically distinct isolates dengue virus. found 
dcr2 genotype associated resistance dengue virus virus
isolate-specific manner. contrast, association found genotypes
at two control loci flanking dcr2, making likely dcr2 contains the
yet-unidentified causal polymorphism(s). result supports idea that
host-pathogen compatibility system depends, part, a
genotype-by-genotype interaction dcr2 viral genome, points to
the rnai pathway potentially important determinant intrinsic insect-virus
genetic specificity.
