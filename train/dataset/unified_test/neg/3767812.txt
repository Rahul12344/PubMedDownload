a historical account diagnosis characterization strains of
mycoplasma gallisepticum low virulence.

yoder hw jr.

numerous chicken flocks studied beginning 1970 questionable
results serologic tests mycoplasma gallisepticum (mg). typically a
low number hens flocks positive reactors rapid serum plate 
test rarely hemagglutination-inhibition (hi) titers 1:80. usually no
clinical signs observed. isolates mg eventually cultured most
of flocks exhibited type marginal serologic pattern. the
laboratory, mg isolates frequently less virulent less pathogenic
than typical field isolates recovered previous years. isolates
produced airsacculitis varying severity broilers exposed mg
cultures aerosols following exposure infectious bronchitis virus. they
became positive rapid serum plate test developed moderate high hi
titers. egg-transmission appeared likely means transmission,
even though infected progeny rarely showed clinical signs disease.
