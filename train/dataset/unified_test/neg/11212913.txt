the endogenous drosophila melanogaster retrovirus gypsy (mdg4) forms virus-like
particles (vlps) found extracellular particles medium used to
culture d. melanogaster cells. d. hydei somatic cell line dh14, does
not harbour gypsy sequences, exposed d. melanogaster vlps. subsequent pcr 
and southern analysis revealed gypsy elements penetrated d.
hydei cells, suggesting interspecific transmission retrovirus. d. hydei 
cell line containing gypsy sequences established grown mixed culture
together g418-resistant d. hydei cell line dh33, gypsy shown 
be transmitted cell cell. proportion cells carrying gypsy
increased time. rate gypsy invasion lines dh14 dh33 was
10(-3) 10(-2) per cell per generation, respectively. results demonstrate 
the possibility interspecific horizontal transfer gypsy form 
vlps.
