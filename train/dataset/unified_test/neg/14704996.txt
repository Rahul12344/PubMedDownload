clinical trials recent years involving adoptive transfer of
antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl) shown promise restoring
immunity viral infection reducing tumor burden patients solid
and hematological malignancies. however, large cell number required to
achieve efficacy, 10(9) 10(11), makes routine application adoptive
immunotherapy impractical. investigation new methods ctl expansion may be
useful addressing problem. use stirred suspension bioreactors one 
such method may allow large-scale t-cell expansion. suspension cultures
offer advantages conventional static culture methods, including providing 
homogeneous culture environment, potential optimization control
of culture conditions. generated cytomegalovirus (cmv)-specific ctl and
investigated potential stirred bioreactor systems expansion large
cell numbers. found ctl readily expanded ( > 200-fold) from
cryopreserved stocks nonspecific stimulation presence allogeneic
feeder cells interleukin-2 (il-2). activated ctl inoculated either
suspension static cultures could subsequently expanded tenfold, showed 
similar growth kinetics metabolism independent culture vessel used.
furthermore, ctl remained specific cmvpp65 peptide expansion
phases, demonstrated pp65-tetramer staining ( > 95% tetramer(+)) and
cytotoxicity assays. study indicates suspension reactor systems may 
useful large-scale expansion antigen-specific ctl lines clones, may 
facilitate advancement routine adoptive immunotherapy.
