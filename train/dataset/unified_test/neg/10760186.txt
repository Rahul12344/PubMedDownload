the saliva haematophagous arthropods (e.g. mosquitoes, sandflies ticks)
contains potent immunomodulatory activities counter hosts'
haemostatic, inflammatory immune responses facilitate blood-feeding. 
effects exploited arthropod-transmitted pathogens promote their
transmission. investigated ability tick saliva enhance
arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmission determining effect the
antiviral action murine interferon (ifn alpha/beta). salivary gland extract
(sge) prepared partially fed adult female dermacentor reticulatus ticks 
that feeding mice either 3 5 days (sged3 sged5,
respectively). demonstrated sge inhibits antiviral effect ifn as
measured biological assay using vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv), by
two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis appearance selected vsv
proteins. pronounced effect observed mouse l cells treated
with sge prior ifn treatment. following pretreatment sge, virus
multiplication (which fully blocked ifn treatment alone) achieved yields
similar obtained infected cells treated ifn.
contemporaneous treatment, treatment sge ifn, less effective.
in parallel findings, formation early viral proteins, n
(nucleocapsid protein) p (phosphoprotein), blocked ifn, was
detectable following pretreatment sge. ability inhibit antiviral 
action ifn higher sged3 compared sged5. demonstration tick sge
can promote virus replication suppressing action ifn helps explain 
ticks efficient vectors arboviruses.
