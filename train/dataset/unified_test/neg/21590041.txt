interference papilloma viruses p53-dependent -independent apoptotic
pathways.

bauer g.

papillomavirus infection interferes four distinct dominant levels of
intra- intercellular control oncogenesis, three based 
induction apoptosis. papillomaviruses cause abrogation cellular
senescence program interfere p53-dependent dna repair apoptosis
triggered dna damage. result, spontaneous induced mutations not
eradicated transformed state may established oncogene
activation tumor suppressor gene inactivation. interference of
papillomaviruses recently described p53-independent intercellular control 
step, nontransformed cells induce apoptosis specifically their
transformed neighbouring cells, allows survival papillomavirus-expressing
transformed cells. finally, p53-dependent hypoxia-triggered apoptosis in
microtumors may overcome papillomaviruses thus lead efficient and
rapid tumor progression.
