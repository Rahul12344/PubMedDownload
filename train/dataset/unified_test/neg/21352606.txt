hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (haaa) uncommon distinct variant
of aplastic anemia pancytopenia appears two three months an
acute attack hepatitis. haaa occurs frequently young male children and
is lethal leave untreated. etiology syndrome proposed be
attributed various hepatitis non hepatitis viruses. several hepatitis
viruses hav, hbv, hcv, hdv, hev hgv associated this
set symptoms. viruses hepatitis viruses parvovirus b19,
cytomegalovirus, epstein bar virus, transfusion transmitted virus (ttv) and
non-a-e hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) also documented develop the
syndrome. considerable evidences including clinical features, severe
imbalance cell immune system effective response immunosuppressive
therapy strongly present haaa immune mediated mechanism. however, no
association haaa found blood transfusions, drugs toxins.
besides hepatitis non hepatitis viruses immunopathogenesis phenomenon 
causative agents disorder, telomerase mutation, genetic factor also 
been predisposed development aplastic anemia. diagnosis includes
clinical manifestations, blood profiling, viral serological markers testing,
immune functioning bone marrow hypocellularity examination. patients
presenting features haaa mostly treated bone marrow or
hematopoietic cell transplantation hla matched donor, available
then immunosuppressive therapy. new therapeutic approaches involve the
administration steroids especially glucocorticoids augment the
immunosuppressive therapy response. pancytopenia following episode acute
hepatitis response better hematopoietic cell transplantation than
immunosuppressive therapy.
