background: although potent antiviral effect acyclovir the
herpes-simplex (hsv) varicela-zoster (vzv) virus scarce effectiveness
versus cytomegalovirus (cmv) known, data suggest may an
immunodulator implicated control viral disease. aim this
study characterize possible effect acyclovir versus cmv
antigen.
methods: stimulated cultures mononuclear cells obtained 7 healthy
patients seropositive cmv hsv cmv antigen, hsv with
phitohemaglutinine (pha). proliferation index culture cell phenotype were
later determined absence presence acyclovir (2 micrograms/ml). in
another group proliferation index cell phenotype following stimulation
with cmv antigen studied prior treating volunteers
with acyclovir one week (800 mg/6h).
results: cmv antigen hsv induced cell proliferation predominantly
involving cd8+ subpopulation leading inversion cd4/cd8 quotient.
on addition acyclovir cell culture moderate reduction produced in
lymphoproliferative response versus cmv antigen hvs, characteristically
modulating cd8+ cell proliferation, thereby leading reestablishment the
cd4/cd8 quotient. however, proliferation induced pha inhibited.
these results produced oral administration acyclovir.
conclusions: acyclovir modulates lymphoproliferative response induced cmv 
antigen. based observation, authors hypothesize this
immunomodulation may related preventive effect cmv disease in
transplanted patients.
