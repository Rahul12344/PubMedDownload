retroviruses received widespread attention past they
caused tumors animals and, perhaps, man, also served as
useful tools elucidate molecular mechanisms involved control of
eukaryotic gene expression. brief overview, evidences presented 
retrovirus-like particles regularly demonstrated human teratocarcinomas
cultured vitro. viruses morphologically reminiscent animal
retrovirus strains show also unique structural features. viruses possess 
endogenous reverse transcriptase activity banded 1.16 g/ml in
sucrose gradients, density characteristic retroviruses. clearly 
distinguished animal retrovirus strains immunological grounds. will
also briefly summarize data accumulating human t-cell lymphoma
viruses (htlv) recently discovered first gallo et al. and
independently hinuma miyoshi. htlv seem play etiological role the
establishment human adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma thus represent the
first pathogenic human retroviruses.
