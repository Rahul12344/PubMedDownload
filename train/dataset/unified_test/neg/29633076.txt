we evaluated anti-influenza-virus effects melia components discuss the
utility components. effects leaf components melia azedarach l.
on viruses examined, plaque inhibition tests performed. vivo
efficacy m. azedarach l. tested mouse model. leaf components melia
azedarach l. markedly inhibited growth various influenza viruses. an
initial screening, multiplication haemagglutination (ha) activities h1n1, 
h3n2, h5, b influenza viruses inactivated liquid extract of
leaves m. azedarach l. (mle). furthermore, plaque inhibition titres h1n1,
h3n2, b influenza viruses treated mle ranged 103.7 104.2. mle
possessed high plaque-inhibitory activity pandemic avian h5n1, h7n9, 
h9n2 vaccine candidate strains, plaque inhibition titre than
104.2. notably, buoyant density decreased 1.175 1.137Â g/cm3, and
spikeless particles appeared. identified four anti-influenza virus substances:
pheophorbide b, pheophorbide a, pyropheophorbide a, pheophytin a.
photomorphogenesis inside envelope may lead removal ha and
neuraminidase spikes viruses. thus, mle could efficiently remove floating
influenza virus air space without toxicity. consistent finding, 
intranasal administration mle mice significantly decreased occurrence
of pneumonia. additionally, leaf powder melia (mlp) inactivated influenza
viruses viruses intestines chickens. mle mlp may have
applications novel, safe biological disinfectants use humans and
poultry.
