the nd18 strain barley stripe mosaic virus (bsmv) infects several lines of
brachypodium distachyon, recently developed model system genomics research 
in cereals. among inbred lines tested, bd3-1 highly resistant 20 25 
°c, whereas bd21 susceptible infection results intense mosaic
phenotype accompanied high levels replicating virus. generated f(6:7)
recombinant inbred line (ril) population cross bd3-1 bd21 
used rils, f(2) population second bd21 × bd3-1 cross evaluate 
the inheritance resistance. results indicate resistance segregates as
expected single dominant gene, designated barley stripe
mosaic virus resistance 1 (bsr1). constructed genetic linkage map ril
population using snp markers map gene within 705 kb distal end 
of top chromosome 3. additional caps indel markers used fine
map bsr1 23 kb interval containing five putative genes. study
demonstrates power using rils rapidly map genetic determinants of
bsmv resistance brachypodium. moreover, rils associated genetic 
map, combined complete genomic sequence brachypodium, provide
new resources genetic analyses many traits.
