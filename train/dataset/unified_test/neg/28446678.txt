controversy still surrounds etiology pathophysiology vestibular
neuritis (vn). especially uncertain superior vestibular nerve (svn) is
more frequently affected inferior vestibular nerve (ivn), is
partially totally spared. address question, developed improved
method preparing human vestibular ganglia (vg) nerve. subsequently,
macro- microanatomical well pcr studies performed 38 human
ganglia 38 individuals. svn 2.4 mm longer ivn, 65%
of cases, ivn ran two separate bony canals, case for
the svn. anastomoses facial cochlear nerves common 
the svn (14/38 9/38, respectively) ivn (7/38 2/38,
respectively). using reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr), found
only latently herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1)-infected vg (18.4%). cases 
of two separate neuronal fields, infected neurons located superior
part only. summary, pcr micro- macroanatomical studies provide
possible explanations high frequency svn infection vestibular
neuritis.importance vestibular neuritis known affect superior part of
the vestibular nerve frequently inferior part. reason 
clinical phenomenon remains unclear. anatomical differences may play role, or
if latent hsv-1 infection assumed, etiology may due different
distribution infection. shed light subject, we
conducted different macro- microanatomical studies. also assessed the
presence hsv-1 vg different sections vg. findings add new
information macro- microanatomy vg well the
pathophysiology vestibular neuritis. also show latent hsv-1 infection 
of vg neurons less frequent previously reported.
