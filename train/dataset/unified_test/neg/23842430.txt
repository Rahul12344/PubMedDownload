vaccinia virus protein a33 (a33vacv) plays important role protection
against orthopoxviruses, hence included experimental multi-subunit
smallpox vaccines. study show single-dose vaccination with
recombinant sindbis virus expressing a33vacv, sufficient protect mice
against lethal challenge vaccinia virus wr (vacv-wr) ectromelia virus
(ectv) cowpox virus (cpxv), closely related orthopoxvirus.
moreover, subunit vaccine based cowpox virus a33 ortholog (a33cpxv)
failed protect cowpox partially protected mice against
vacv-wr challenge. mapped regions sequence variation a33vacv and
a33cpxvand analyzed role variations protection. identified a
single protective region located residues 104-120 harbors putative
h-2kd cell epitope well b cell epitope - target neutralizing 
antibody mab-1g10 blocks spreading extracellular virions. epitopes
in a33cpxv mutated predicted non-functional. whereas vaccination
with a33vacv induce in-vivo ctl activity predicted epitope,
inhibition virus spread in-vitro, protection lethal vacv challenge
pointed b cell epitope highlighting critical role residue l118 
of adjacent compensatory residues protection. epitope's critical role 
protection, well modifications within orthopoxvirus genus be
taken context failure a33 protect cpxv demonstrated 
here. findings considered developing new subunit vaccines
and monoclonal antibody based therapeutics orthopoxviruses, especially
variola virus, etiologic agent smallpox.
