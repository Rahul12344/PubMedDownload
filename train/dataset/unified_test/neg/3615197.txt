a simple rapid procedure preparation m13 single stranded dna
sequencing templates involve phenol extractions alcohol
precipitations described. bacteriophages precipitated media
supernatants acetic acid recovered glass fiber filters. subsequent
dissociation phages removal contaminants performed dna
is bound glass. finally, purified dna eluted small volume of
low-salt buffer. yield higher obtained standard methods. 
simplified procedure takes less 30 minutes demand special
skills equipment; sequence resolution good obtained by
standard procedures klenow fragment t7 dna polymerase, with
radioactive labelling well automated sequencing fluorescent
label.
