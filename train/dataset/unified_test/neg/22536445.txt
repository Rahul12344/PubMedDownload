background aims: diagnostic values fibrotest (ft) hepatic fibrosis
have rarely assessed asian chronic hepatitis b (chb) patients. aimed
to validate diagnostic performances comparison liver stiffness (ls).
methods: 2008 2010, 194 chb patients underwent liver biopsies along
with ft transient elastography prospectively enrolled. fibrosis stage
was assessed according batts ludwig system.
results: predict significant fibrosis (f≥2), advanced fibrosis (f≥3), and
cirrhosis (f = 4), areas receiver operating characteristic curves (aurocs) 
of ft 0.903, 0.907, 0.866, comparable ls (0.873, 0.897, 
0.910, respectively). optimized cutoffs ft maximize sum sensitivity 
specificity 0.32, 0.52, 0.68 f≥2, f≥3, f = 4, ls 
were 8.8, 10.2, 14.1 kpa, respectively. according ft ls cutoffs, 123
(63.4%) 124 (63.9%) patients correctly classified consistent with
histological fibrosis (f1, f2, f3, f4), respectively. overall concordance
between fibrosis stage estimated ft ls observed 111 patients, 
where 88 correctly classified histological results. combination
formula adding ls ft (ls+ft) showed similar auroc levels (0.885, 0.905, and
0.915), another multiplying ls ft (ls×ft) showed best aurocs (0.941,
0.931, 0.929 f≥2, f≥3, f4, respectively).
conclusions: ft provides good fibrosis prediction, comparable outcomes ls
in asian chb patients. ft substantially reduces need liver biopsy, especially
when used combination ls.
