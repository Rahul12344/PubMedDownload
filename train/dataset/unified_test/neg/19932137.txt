penicillin g acylase (ec 3.5.1.11) 86-kda large heterodimeric protein
comprising two peptide 23-kda peptide b 62-kda, produced intein-mediated
auto-splicing 92-kda precursor. since penicillin g acylase potentially
employed preparation wide range semi-synthetic beta-lactam
antibiotics acyl side-chain precursors beta-lactam nucleus, directed
evolution penicillin acylase using phage display technology extending 
novel specificity interesting topic industry academic. fused
the penicillin acylase fd phage coat protein iii used piii secretion
signal sequence instead penicillin acylase, coupled gene enzyme on
phage particle useful directed evolution penicillin acylase.
western blotting enzyme activity assay performed demonstrate
penicillin acylase functionally displayed phage surface. owing the
intimate association enzyme activity precursor processing penicillin
acylase, alterations protein residues make phage library be
careful lead processing defects. site-directed mutagenesis, 
then identified effect ser b1 asn b241 variants post-translational
maturation phage fused penicillin acylase.
