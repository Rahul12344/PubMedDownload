it reported hepatitis c virus (hcv) antibody-positivity adversely
affects cardiac function. screening hcv began 1992, hypothesized
that hcv antibody-positive rate would high adult congenital heart disease
(achd) patients underwent heart surgery 1992 adversely affected
cardiac function long-term prognosis. retrospectively enrolled 243 achd
patients (mean age 25.9 years) underwent cardiac surgery 1992 and
visited hospital 1995 2015. compared clinical characteristics
including cardiac function long-term prognosis hcv antibody-positive 
(n = 48) antibody-negative (n = 195) patients. composite end point (cep) 
included cardiac death, heart failure hospitalization, lethal ventricular
arrhythmias, cardiac reoperation. prevalence reduced systemic
ventricular ejection fraction <50% significantly higher hcv
antibody-positive group compared hcv antibody-negative group (17 vs
5.4%, p = 0.014). mean follow-up period 10.1 years (interquartile
range 6 14 years), cep noted 51 patients. kaplan-meier analysis
showed hcv antibody-positive group significantly poor event-free survival
than hcv antibody-negative group (log-rank, p = 0.002). contrast, hcv
ribonucleic acid-positivity significant predictor cep hcv
antibody-positive group (log-rank, p = 0.442). furthermore, hcv
antibody-positivity significantly associated cep univariable
and multivariable cox regression models (hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confident
interval 1.32 4.15, p = 0.005 1.96, 1.06 3.63, p = 0.032,
respectively). conclusion, results suggest attention be
paid hcv antibody-positivity management achd patients.
