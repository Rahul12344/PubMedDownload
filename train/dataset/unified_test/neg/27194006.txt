hepatitis e virus (hev), rotavirus (rv), astrovirus (astv) important
pathogens transmit common fecal-oral route, causing hepatitis
(hev) gastroenteritis (rv astv) respectively humans. study, we
developed evaluated two subunit vaccine candidates consisted same
protruding spike protein antigens three viruses two formats, a
fusion three antigens one molecule (fused vaccine) vs. mixture of
the three free antigens together (mixed vaccine). vaccines easily made 
via e. coli expression system. mouse immunization experiments showed the
fused vaccine elicited significantly higher antibody responses three 
viral antigens induced mixed vaccine. addition, mouse
post-immune antisera fused vaccine revealed significantly higher
neutralizing titers hev infection cell culture, well as
significantly higher 50% blocking titers (bt50) rv vp8-hbga receptor
interactions post-immune antisera immunization the
mixed vaccine. thus, fused vaccine promising trivalent vaccine candidate
against hev, rv, astv, worth development.
