in virulence development genomic replication defects. we
have isolated mouse hepatitis virus 3 (mhv3) variants brain of
chronically infected mice 105 days postinfection culture on
overconfluent l2 cells. spite atrophy leukopenia observed lymphoid
organs mice, viruses isolated numerous attempts. contrast,
defective-interfering viruses detected peritoneal exudate cells from
chronically-infected mice. brain-derived viruses differ parental virus in
their delayed fusion activity attenuated pathogenicity c57bl/6 a/j
mice. attenuated brain isolates ceased replicate thymocytes but
replicated nonadherent spleen peritoneal exudate cells.
