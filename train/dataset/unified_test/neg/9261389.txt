although cd4+ cells primary targets human immunodeficiency virus type 
1 (hiv-1) infection, earlier reports suggested intrathymic infection of
cd8+ cells may occur. however, unclear whether hiv-1-infected cd8+
thymocytes truly mature single-positive (sp) cells. present study,
scid mice implanted human fetal thymus liver tissues (scid-hu mice) were
infected three primary isolates hiv-1 infected thymocytes were
analyzed assess maturational status. intra-implant intraperitoneal
injection hiv-1, thymocytes sorted three-color flow cytometric
analysis mature populations cd3hicd4+ cd3hicd8+ sp cells > 99%
purity (< 0.3% cd4-containing cells cd8+ population). presence of
hiv-1 provirus sorted thymocyte populations determined quantitative
pcr. fraction mature cd3hicd8+ thymocytes contained hiv-1 proviral dna, 
evidence viral mrna transcription cells demonstrated situ
hybridization. contrast, uninfected cd3hicd8+ thymocytes cocultured 
with hiv-1-infected cd4+ thymocytes, evidence productive hiv-1 infection
was detected. thus, hiv-1 infection cd8+ thymocytes scid-hu mouse 
not occur direct contact virus. rather, cell surface cd4 required;
therefore, precursor cells likely primary target hiv-1 infection in
the thymus. ontogeny, infected cells continue their
differentiation mature cd8+ sp thymocytes contain proviral dna and
express viral rna.
