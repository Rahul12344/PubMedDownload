many properties hsv-1 especially suitable using virus vector
to treat diseases affecting central nervous system (cns), parkinson's
disease malignant gliomas. advantageous properties include natural
neurotropism, high transduction efficiency, large transgene capacity, the
ability entering latent state neurons. selective oncolysis combination
with modulation immune response mediated replication-conditional hsv-1 
vectors appears highly promising approach battle malignant
glioma. helper virus-free hsv/aav hybrid amplicon vectors great promise in
mediating long-term gene expression pns cns treatment of
various neurodegenerative disorders chronic pain. current research focuses 
the design hsv-1-derived vectors targeted certain cell types 
support transcriptionally regulatable transgene expression. here, review the
recent developments hsv-1-based vector systems applications in
experimental clinical gene therapy protocols.
