the adaptation human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) array of
physiologic niches advantaged plasticity viral genome, encoded
proteins, promoter. cxcr4-utilizing (x4) viruses preferentially, not
universally, infect cd4+ cells, generating high levels virus within
activated hiv-1-infected cells detected regional lymph nodes and
peripheral blood. comparison, ccr5-utilizing (r5) viruses greater
preference cells monocyte-macrophage lineage; however, r5
viruses also display propensity enter replicate cells, infect 
a smaller percentage cd4+ cells comparison x4 viruses. additionally,
r5 viruses associated viral transmission cns disease are
also prevalent hiv-1 disease. specific adaptive changes associated
with x4 r5 viruses identified co-linear viral sequences beyond the
env-v3. silico position-specific scoring matrix (pssm) algorithm used 
to define distinct groups x4 r5 sequences based solely sequences in
env-v3. bioinformatic tools used identify genetic signatures involving
specific protein domains long terminal repeat (ltr) transcription factor sites
within co-linear viral protein r (vpr), trans-activator transcription (tat),
or ltr sequences preferentially associated x4 r5 env-v3
sequences. number differential amino acid nucleotide changes were
identified across co-linear vpr, tat, ltr sequences, suggesting the
presence specific genetic signatures preferentially associate x4 
r5 viruses. investigation genetic relatedness x4 r5 viruses
utilizing phylogenetic analyses complete sequences could used to
definitively uniquely identify groups r5 x4 sequences; contrast,
differences genetic diversities x4 r5 readily identified 
within co-linear sequences hiv-1-infected patients.
