the 5' splice site signal (5'ss) moloney murine sarcoma virus ts110
(musvts110) rna found participate regulation splicing
phenotype. 5'ss (cag/guagga) departs mammalian consensus
(cag/guragu) positions +4 +6, base pair u1 u6 small
nuclear rnas splicing. doubling splicing efficiency near
elimination splicing thermosensitivity characteristic musvts110 were
observed 5'ss mutants containing u position +6 (termed 5' a6u), even in
those u1-5'ss complementarity reduced. permissive
temperature (28 degrees c), 5' a6u mutation increased efficiency the
second splicing reaction, nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees c), 
both splicing reactions positively affected.
