it well known lactoferrin (lf) potent inhibitor towards several
enveloped naked viruses, rotavirus, enterovirus adenovirus. lf is
resistant tryptic digestion breast-fed infants excrete high levels of

antiviral action protein three viral models which, despite
representing different genoma replication strategies, share ability to
infect gut. concerning mechanism action rotavirus, lf from
bovine milk (blf) possesses dual role, preventing virus attachment to
intestinal cells binding viral particles, inhibiting post adsorption 
step. blf effect towards poliovirus due interference early 
infection step but, blf molecule saturated zn+2 ions, also
capable inhibiting viral replication viral adsorption phase. the
anti-adenovirus action blf takes place virus attachment cell membranes

adsorption internalisation cells specific binding cell
receptors and/or viral particles.
