oral cancer important health issue. predicts continuing worldwide
increase number patients oral cancer, extending trend well
into next several decades. us projected number new cases of
oral oropharyngeal cancer exceed 31,000 per year. mortality due to
cancers region exceeds annual death rate us caused either
cutaneous melanoma cervical cancer. significant agents involved the
etiology oral cancer western countries include sunlight exposure, smoking
and alcohol consumption. use areca betel nut many cultures a
major etiological factor outside usa. etiologic factors associated
with oral squamous cell carcinoma, far less significant statistically,
include syphilis sideropenic dysphagia. recently, strong evidence an
etiological relationship human papilloma virus subset head and
neck cancers noted. generally accepted sporadic tumors
are result multi-step process accumulated genetic alterations. 
alterations affect epithelial cell behavior way loss chromosomal
heterozygosity turn leads series events progressing the
ultimate stage invasive squamous cell carcinoma. corresponding genetic
alterations reflected clinical microscopic pathology hyperplasia 
through invasiveness. wide range mucosal alternations fall within rubric
of leukoplakia. proliferative verrucous leukoplakia represents relatively new
type leukoplakia separate common less innocuous form 
of condition. erythroplakia particularly relevant considering almost 
certain relationship dysplasia invasive carcinoma. squamous cell
carcinoma develop antecedent dysplastic oral mucosal lesions an
early diagnosis made treatment given. early diagnosis within
stages ii correspond vastly improved 5-year survival rate when
compared advanced stage iii iv lesions. surgical management this
disease remains mainstay treatment. therapies include radiation 
chemotherapy options may used adjunctively palliatively. following
treatment, important understand significant risks second primary 
cancers developing within upper aerodigestive tract result field
cancerization. important message early detection the
asymptomatic early stage oral cancer translates general terms satisfactory 
clinical outcome cure patients.
