introduction: interleukin 10 knockout (il-10-/-) mice spontaneously develop th1
t cell mediated colitis many similarities crohn's disease. daily
injections il-10 unable induce remission mice established
disease. contrast, shown previously intravenous administration of
adenoviral vectors encoding il-10 (advmuil-10) induces hepatic il-10 release 
leads long term disease suppression profound systemic immunoregulatory
changes.
aims: determine whether rectal delivery advmuil-10 induces localised
colonic il-10 expression without systemic immune suppression, assess its
therapeutic efficacy il-10-/- mice established colitis.
results: single rectal infusion 5 x 10(8) pfu advmuil-10 10 week il-
10-/- mice resulted median level 27.3 pg/mg il-10 colonic homogenates 
harvested one week later. il-10-/- mice established colitis treated 
enema 5 x 10(8) pfu advmuil-10 entered clinical histological remission
whereas empty cassette adenovirus (adv0) phosphate buffered saline (pbs)
treated mice developed progressive disease. four weeks, histological
score advmuil-10 treated mice (4.4 (1.5)) significantly lower of
adv0 (11.1 (1.1); p<0.001) pbs (10.9 (1.0); p<0.01) treated controls. in
addition, stool concentration il-1beta four week experiment was
significantly higher mice treated saline adv0 treated
with advmuil-10 (p<0.01).
conclusion: local advmuil-10 therapy reverses colitis il-10-/- mice without
the systemic effects seen intravenous administration. gene therapy
strategies using adenoviral vectors encoding immunoregulatory cytokines may prove
to potent approach treatment chronic inflammatory diseases as
crohn's disease.
