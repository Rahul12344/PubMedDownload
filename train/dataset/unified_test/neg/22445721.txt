tumor-associated macrophages (tam) major supportive component within
neoplasms characterized plethora functions facilitate tumor 
outgrowth. mechanisms macrophage attraction differentiation a
tumor-promoting phenotype, defined among others distinct cytokine patterns
such pronounced interleukin (il-10) production, ill-defined. aimed to
identify signaling pathways contribute generation tam-like
macrophages using adenoviral rnai-based approach. primary human
monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated apoptotic tumor cell
supernatants (acm) induce tam-like phenotype, characterized secretion 
il-10, il-6, il-8 repression il-12. high-throughput screen,
macrophages transduced 8495 constructs adenoviral shrna

targets. identified 96 genes involved il-10 production response acm
and observed pronounced cluster targets regulating il-10 il-6.
validation five targets within il-10/il-6 cluster performed using
sirna pharmacological inhibitors human primary macrophages. among those,
interleukin 4 receptor-α cannabinoid receptor 2 confirmed regulators 
of il-10 il-6 secretion acm-stimulated macrophages. approach
characterizes cellular functions transfection-resistant, highly plastic and
versatile cells identifies novel targets involved generation a
