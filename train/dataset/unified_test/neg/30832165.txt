unusual viral symptoms seen lisianthus (eustoma russellianum) grown in
the besor area israel. symptoms included necrotic spots rings leaves
and systemic necrosis. preliminary analyses suggested disease caused
by tospovirus. virus particles typical tospovirus observed with
electron microscopy samples taken symptomatic leaves.
double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests leaf sap,
extracted lisianthus mechanically inoculated indicator plants, gave a
strong positive reaction iris yellow spot virus (iysv). polyclonal antibodies 
prepared iysv enabled specific detection virus crude sap from
infected plants. western blot analysis showed iysv serologically
distinct tomato spotted wilt virus (tswv). primers specific the
nucleocapsid gene iysv used reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction assay (rt-pcr) verify presence iysv. rt-pcr gave expected
pcr product approximately 850 bp. sequence cloned nucleocapsid gene
confirmed identity iysv, thus confirming iysv infection lisianthus.
this first report iysv infection dicotyledons.
