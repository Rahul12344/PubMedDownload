the expression gene murine tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases 
(timp) induced response viruses, growth factors, phorbol esters. 
this report show accumulation timp mrna newcastle disease
virus induction caused transcriptional activation gene. comparison
of sequences cdna genomic clones along rnase protection and
primer extension analyses revealed murine timp gene possesses multiple
cap sites exon 1 consists exclusively 5'-noncoding sequences. 
observed dna regions analogous found upstream the
virus-inducible interferon genes present within intron 1 timp gene. to
investigate possible role timp intron 1 gene expression, used a
functional assay based transfection plasmids dna segment
to tested placed proximity marker gene driven heterologous
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. results indicate timp
intron 1 contains dna sequence elements capable modulating activity a
heterologous promoter two different ways: (i) enhancing constitutive
expression (ii) conferring virus inducibility. results suggest 
intron 1 may involved transcriptional regulation timp gene
expression.
