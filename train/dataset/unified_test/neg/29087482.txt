both ebola virus (ebov) reston virus (restv) cause disease nonhuman
primates, yet ebov causes disease humans. investigate differences in
viral pathogenicity, humanized mice (hu-nsg-sgm3) inoculated ebov or
restv. consistent differences disease human infection, pronounced
weight loss markers hepatic damage disease observed exclusively
in ebov-infected mice. abnormalities associated significantly
higher ebov replication liver spleen, suggesting in
this model, efficiency viral replication select tissues early infection 
may contribute differences viral pathogenicity.
