background: herpes simplex virus (hsv-1) gene expression thought shut off
recombinant gene expression hsv-1 vectors; however, helper virus-free
hsv-1 vector system, number promoters support short-term expression.
these results raise paradox recombinant gene expression remains
short-term even absence almost (approximately 99%) hsv-1
genome, hsv-1 genes, hsv-1 gene expression. resolve paradox, we
hypothesized specific proteins hsv-1 virus particle shut off
recombinant gene expression. two earlier studies, examined effects on
recombinant gene expression packaging vectors using specific mutated hsv-1
proteins. found vectors packaged using mutated ul13 (a protein kinase),
or vp16, ul46 and/or ul47 (components vp16 transcriptional complex)
supported improved long-term expression, vectors packaged using mutated ul46 
and/or ul47 also supported improved gene transfer (numbers cells 4 days).
these results suggested hypothesis specific proteins hsv-1
particle act multiple pathways reduce recombinant gene expression. test 
this hypothesis, examined combinations mutated proteins included 
ul13 specific components vp16 transcriptional complex.
results: hsv-1 vector containing neuronal-specific promoter packaged
using specific combinations mutated proteins, resulting vector stocks 
were tested rat striatum. supporting long-term expression, the
preferred combination mutated hsv-1 proteins mutated ul13, ul46, ul47.
vectors packaged using combination mutated proteins supported higher
efficiency gene transfer high levels expression 3 months, longest 
time examined.
conclusion: vector particles containing combination mutated hsv-1
proteins improve recombinant gene expression. implications results for
strategies improve long-term expression discussed. moreover,
long-term expression benefit specific gene therapy applications.
