in study, examined humoral immune responses vivo tumour
immunity induced baculovirus recombinant simian virus 40 (sv40) large tumour
antigen (rsv40 t-ag). balb/c mice immunized rsv40 t-ag produced antibody
responses recognized sv40 large tumour antigen (t-ag) elisa. analysis 
these anti-sv40 t-ag responses indicated antibodies recognized epitopes 
associated carboxy amino terminus sv40 t-ag. pattern of
sv40 t-ag epitope recognition similar observed anti-sv40 t-ag
responses induced inoculation irradiated sv40-transformed cells. mice
immunized either rsv40 t-ag inactivated transformed cells were
protected subsequent vivo lethal tumour challenge live
sv40-transformed cells. studies suggest humoral immune responses
induced rsv40 t-ag similar epitope specificity induced by
inactivated sv40-transformed cells. addition, recombinant tumour-specific
antigens papovaviruses, sv40, used induce tumour immunity 
which protects subsequent lethal tumour challenge. study may provide 
insight use recombinant tumour antigens putative tumour vaccines
and development active immunotherapeutic strategies treating
virus-induced cancers.
