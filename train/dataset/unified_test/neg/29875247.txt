zika virus (zikv) emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus devastating
outcomes seen recently americas due association maternal zikv
infection fetal microcephaly fetal malformations previously
associated flavivirus infections. here, developed olive baboon
(papio anubis) nonhuman primate (nhp) translational model study of
zikv pathogenesis associated disease outcomes contrast compare with
humans major nhps, macaques. following subcutaneous inoculation
of adult male nonpregnant female baboons, viremia detected 3 4
days postinfection (dpi) concordant presentation visible rash and
conjunctivitis, similar human zikv infection. furthermore, virus detected 
in mucosa cerebrospinal fluid. robust zikv-specific igm igg
antibody response also observed animals. data show striking 
similarity humans olive baboon following infection zikv,
suggesting model suitable translational nhp model study zikv
pathogenesis potential therapeutics.importance zikv first identified in
1947 sentinel rhesus monkey uganda subsequently spread southeast
asia. 2007, small number cases reported, zikv infection 
was relatively minor south pacific brazilian outbreaks, 
severe outcomes reported. here, present baboon nonhuman primate 
model contrast comparison published animal models zikv,
such mouse macaque species. baboons breed year round not
currently primary nonhuman primate species used biomedical research, making 
them readily available studies human immunodeficiency virus
studies, many macaque species designated for. this, taken together with
the similarities baboons humans, immunology, reproduction,
genetics, size, makes baboon attractive nhp model zikv studies 
comparison nonhuman primates.
