although clinical course lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (lpl)/waldenström
macroglobulinemia (wm) usually indolent, high-grade non-hodgkin lymphoma may
develop small subset patients. found patients lpl/wm
associated hodgkin disease (hd) described literature, prompting us to
report 2 cases. case 1, patient lpl/wm involving bone marrow diagnosed
1 week left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy revealed lpl/wm and
classical hd. case 2, patient 15-year history lpl/wm before
classical hd developed involving bone marrow, liver, lymph node. cases
were positive igm, monotypic immunoglobulin light chain, b-cell antigens 
and cd3-. neoplastic hodgkin cells cd15+, cd20+ (case 1), cd30+,
cd3-, cd45- negative epstein-barr virus rna. patients 
treated chemotherapy hd. case 1, clinical response excellent with
no histologic evidence hd subsequent biopsy specimens. case 2, hd was
