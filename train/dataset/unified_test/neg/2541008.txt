a message-dependent, cell-free translation system prepared both
uninduced n,n'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-induced friend erythroleukemia
cells following modification standard protocols. active extracts prepared
by lysing friend erythroleukemia cells hypotonic buffer containing 50 microm
hemin 10 mm cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp), assaying translation
in vitro absence exogenous nucleoside triphosphates. hemin and
camp required full activity appeared act prolonging initiation
in vitro. following treatment cell extracts micrococcal nuclease, brome
mosaic virus, globin, equine herpesvirus type 1, frog virus 3 mrna were
efficiently translated yield full-sized products. using brome mosaic virus 
a test message, levels translation equivalent 30%-50% seen in
mock-treated lysates obtained. results attest translational
efficiency extracts prepared assayed manner described above, and
suggest extracts may useful routine translational studies, 
and tool dissect translational changes accompanying erythroid
differentiation vitro.
