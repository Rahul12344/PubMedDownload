heme oxygenase (ho)-1, inducible isoform ho, immunomodulatory
functions considered target therapeutic interventions. the
present study, investigated whether modulation ho-1 might regulatory
effects in-vitro cell activation. study examined whether: (i) ho-1
induction cobalt-protoporphyrin (copp) inhibition tin-mesoporphyrin
(snmp) affect expansion function virus-specific cells, (ii) ho-1
modulation might functional effect cell populations mediating
effects proliferating cells [e.g. dendritic cells (dcs), regulatory cells 
(t(regs)) natural killer cells] (iii) ho-1-modulated anti-viral cells
might suitable adoptive immunotherapy. inhibition ho-1 via snmp in
cytomegalovirus (cmv)pp65-peptide-pulsed peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmcs) led increased anti-viral cell activation generation a
higher proportion effector memory cells (cd45ra(-) cd62l(-)) increased 
capability secrete interferon (ifn)-γ granzyme b. t(reg) depletion and
snmp exposure increased number anti-viral cells 15-fold. test the
possibility ho-1 modulation might clinically applicable conformity
with good manufacturing practice (gmp), snmp tested isolated anti-viral 
cells using cytokine secretion assay. compared control, snmp treatment
resulted higher cell counts purity without negative impact quality 
effector function [cd107a, ifn-γ tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-α levels were
stable]. results suggest important role ho-1 modulation of
adaptive immune responses. ho-1 inhibition resulted markedly effective
generation functionally active cells suitable adoptive cell therapy.
