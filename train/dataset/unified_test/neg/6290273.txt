restriction endonuclease mboi cleavage dna inhibited actinomycin 
distamycin a. two inhibitors protected different subsets 8 cleavage
sites polyoma dna. cleavage reactions analyzed presence
of minimal inhibitory concentrations compounds higher
concentrations, allowing cleavage 1 site/dna molecule. experiments
showed cleavage sites efficiently protected actinomycin had
putative inhibitor binding sites distance 1-2 base pairs mboi
recognition sequence. distamycin a, contrast, apparently bind
immediately adjacent mboi recognition sequence protect cleavage.
