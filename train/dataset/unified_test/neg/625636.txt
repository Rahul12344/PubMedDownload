168 hbag seropositive 105 hbag seronegative liver biopsies studied for
correlations anti-hbc titers (indirect immunofluorescence method) and
tissue expression hbsag hbcag (immunofluorescence), dane particles in
blood (immune electron microscopy) inflammatory reaction. 98.8% hbag
seropositive patients positive anti-hbc. mean titers showed
statistically significant differences mainly chronic aggressive hepatitis
(1:2(11.3)) versus lobular hepatitis (1:2(10.1)), chronic persistent hepatitis
(1:2(9.9)) nonspecific reactive hepatitis (1:2(7.6)). due considerable
deviation titers within histological groups, however, titers 1:2(11)
are low diagnostic relevance, whereas titers 1:2(12) mainly
indicative chronic aggressive hepatitis, although acute lobular hepatitis with
signs possible transition chronicity chronic persistent hepatitis with
strong inflammatory activity may occur. among hbag seronegative patients 20% were
positive anti-hbc (mean titer = 1:2(7.7)). among 78 patients also tested 
anti-hbs, 10.2% positive anti-hbc anti-hbs. additional
12.8%, anti-hbc marker past hepatitis b virus infection. anti-hbs
was marker 33%. none hbag seronegative patients
