hematoporphyrin derivative shown selectively localize malignant
tissues chemically induced animal papillomas. powerful
photo-sensitizing agent cause destruction death tissues 
it localized generation singlet oxygen activated light of
the appropriate wavelength (photodynamic therapy [pdt]). laryngeal papillomas are
rapidly growing benign epithelial neoplasms clinical course marked by
multiple recurrences surgical removal. considering pdt a
therapeutic modality treatment debilitating disease developed
an animal model experimentation. using cottontail rabbit papillomavirus, 
sometimes referred shope papillomavirus, large cutaneous papillomas
were induced backs dutch belted rabbits. following intravenous
administration hematoporphyrin derivative, pdt delivered white light.
marked regression papillomas noted replacement normal
hair-bearing skin. clinical implications work control of
laryngeal papillomatosis discussed.
