the bcl-2 proto-oncogene product inhibits apoptosis. increased levels bcl-2
protein associated prolonged b-cell survival demonstrated 
in high proportion follicular b-cell lymphoma. recent studies shown
that bcl-2 protein expression b cells immortalized epstein-barr virus (ebv)
in vitro up-regulated ebv-latency-associated antigen, latent membrane
protein (lmp) 1. epithelial malignancy, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (unpc), well-established association ebv tumour
cells characteristically display restricted latent viral phenotype including
lmp 1. study investigated relationship presence ebv
dna, ebv phenotypic profiles bcl-2 protein expression conventionally
processed cryopreserved samples npc using situ hybridization,
immunocytochemical immunoblotting techniques. bcl-2 detected most
(80%) samples unpc well 1/3 samples keratinizing npc 2/2
samples nasopharyngeal adenocarcinoma. however, close correlation found
between presence ebv dna, profiles lmp 1 bcl-2 protein
expression 45 unpc. addition, bcl-2 protein shown selectively
expressed basal compartment normal nasopharyngeal epithelia. bcl-2
protein expression reported previously malignant tumours of
epithelial origin. findings study implicate role bcl-2
