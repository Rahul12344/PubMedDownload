modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) used experimental vaccine
vector respiratory infections. tested safety and
immunogenicity recombinant virus expressing hemagglutinin measles
virus (mva-mv-h) using mouse model measles virus induced encephalitis 
the cotton rat model respiratory infection. mva-mv-h proved induce th1
response, neutralizing antibodies conferred protection both
encephalitis lung infection. cotton rat sensitive infection
with replication competent vaccinia virus. animals mva-mv-h proved be
a well tolerated vaccine. however, efficiency presence mv
specific maternal antibodies low (even using prime-boost strategy) and
therefore might improved.
