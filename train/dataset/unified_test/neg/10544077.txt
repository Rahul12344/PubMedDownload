the al2 gene found members genus begomovirus geminiviridae
encodes transcriptional activator protein (trap; also known al2, ac2, c2 
protein). trap activates expression viral coat protein (cp) br1
movement gene promoters mesophyll cells protoplasts acts derepress 
the cp promoter vascular tissue. experiments presented designed 
to elucidate biochemical properties multifunctional
regulatory protein define activation domain. results indicate that
trap tomato golden mosaic virus (tgmv) binds single-stranded dna a
sequence nonspecific manner weakly interacts double-stranded dna,
confirming earlier results obtained trap begomoviruses. in
addition, evidence presented indicates trap binds zinc zinc
is necessary optimal interaction ssdna. also show trap is
phosphorylated expressed insect cells contains a
transcriptional activation domain acidic type. minimal activation
domain quite small; region comprising 15 c-terminal amino acids
of protein capable activating transcription mouse fibroblasts
(nih3t3 cells) fused heterologous dna-binding domain.
