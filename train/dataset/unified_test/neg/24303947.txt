acquisition non-sterilizing natural immunity plasmodium falciparum malaria 
has shown low transmission areas following multiple exposures. however,
conflicting data endemic areas suggest parasite may interfere 
the induction effective b-cell responses. date, impact blood-stage
parasite exposure antigen-specific b cells reported following
controlled human malaria infection (chmi). analysed human b-cell
responses series phase i/iia clinical trials, include chmi, using
candidate virus-vectored vaccines encoding two blood-stage antigens: merozoite
surface protein 1 (msp1) apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1). previously
vaccinated volunteers show boosting pre-existing antigen-specific memory
b-cell (mbc) responses following chmi. contrast, unvaccinated malaria-naive
control volunteers developed mbc response msp1 ama1. serum igg
correlated mbc response booster vaccination relationship 
was less well maintained following chmi. significant reduction peripheral
msp1-specific mbc observed point diagnosis blood-stage
infection. coincident reduction peripheral blood b-cell
subsets expressing cxcr3 elevated serum levels interferon-γ cxcl9,
suggesting migration away periphery. chmi data confirm mbc
and antibody responses induced boosted blood-stage parasite
exposure, support epidemiological studies low-level parasite exposure.
