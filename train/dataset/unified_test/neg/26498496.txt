background: characterising correlates hiv persistence improves
understanding disease pathogenesis guides design curative
strategies. study investigated factors associated integrated hiv-1 dna 
load consistently suppressive first-line antiretroviral therapy (art).
method: total, integrated, 2-long terminal repeats (ltr) circular hiv-1 dna, 
residual plasma hiv-1 rna, t-cell activation markers, soluble cd14 (scd14)
were measured peripheral blood 50 patients received 1-14 years 
efavirenz-based nevirapine-based therapy.
results: integrated hiv-1 dna load (per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells)
was median 1.9 log10 copies (interquartile range 1.7-2.2) showed mean
difference 0.2 log10 copies per 10 years suppressive art (95% confidence
interval - 0.2, 0.6; p = 0.28). positively correlated total hiv-1 dna
load frequency cd8(+)hla-dr/dp/dq(+) cells, also higher in
subjects higher scd14 levels, showed correlation levels 2-ltr
circular hiv-1 dna residual plasma hiv-1 rna, frequency of
cd4(+)cd38(+) cd8(+)cd38(+) cells. adjusting pre-art viral load, duration
of suppressive art, cd4 cell counts, residual plasma hiv-1 rna levels, scd14 
levels, integrated hiv-1 dna load mean 0.5 log10 copies higher 50%
higher frequency cd8(+)hla-dr/dp/dq(+) cells (95% confidence interval 0.2,
0.9; p = 0.01).
conclusions: observed positive association integrated hiv-1 dna load 
and frequency cd8(+)dr/dp/dq(+) cells indicates close correlation
between hiv persistence immune activation continues consistently
suppressive therapy. inducers distinct activation profile warrant
further investigation.
