tlr22 occurs exclusively aquatic animals role unknown. herein we
show fugu (takifugu rubripes) (fg)tlr3 fgtlr22 link ifn-inducing
pathway via fg toll-il-1r homology domain-containing adaptor protein
1(fgticam-1, trif) adaptor fish cells. fgtlr3 resides endoplasmic
reticulum recognizes relatively short-sized dsrna, whereas fgtlr22 recognizes
long-sized dsrna cell surface. poly(i:c)-stimulated fish cells, both
recruit fgticam-1, turn moves tlr cytoplasmic signalosome 
region. thus, fgticam-1 acts shuttling platform ifn signaling. fish
cells expressing fgtlr22 exposed dsrna aquatic dsrna viruses, cells
induce ifn responses acquire resistance virus infection. thus, fish 
novel ticam-1-coupling tlr distinct mammalian tlr3 cellular
localization, ligand selection, tissue distribution. tlr22 may a
functional substitute human cell-surface tlr3 serve surveillant for
infection dsrna virus alert immune system antiviral protection in
fish.
