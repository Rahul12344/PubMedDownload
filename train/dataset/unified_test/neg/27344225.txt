the explosive zika virus epidemic americas amplifying spread this
emerging pathogen previously unaffected regions world, including
europe (gulland, 2016), local populations immunologically naïve. as
summertime approaches northern hemisphere, aedes mosquitoes europe may 
find suitable climatic conditions acquire subsequently transmit zika virus
from viremic travellers local populations. aedes albopictus proven
to vector transmission dengue chikungunya viruses europe
(delisle et al., 2015; ecdc, n.d.) growing experimental ecological
evidence suggest may also competent zika virus(chouin-carneiro 
et al., 2016; grard et al., 2014; li et al., 2012; wong et al., 2013). we
analyze overlay monthly flows airline travellers arriving into
european cities zika affected areas across americas, predicted
monthly estimates basic reproduction number zika virus areas where
aedes mosquito populations reside europe (aedes aegypti madeira, portugal
and ae. albopictus continental europe), human populations living within
areas mosquito-borne transmission zika virus may possible. we
highlight specific geographic areas timing risk zika virus
introduction possible spread within europe inform efficient use of
human disease surveillance, vector surveillance control, public education
