the wound-induced receptor-like protein kinase (wrk) gene, isolated one the
genes whose transcripts accumulated early period n gene-dependent
synchronized cell death tobacco mosaic virus-infected tobacco plants, encodes 
a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase, transcript was
transiently increased 15 min wounding. present study, analysis 
green fluorescent protein fusion protein indicated wrk localized the
plasma membrane. transgenic tobacco plant lines elevated suppressed
levels wrk transcript, wound-induced accumulation basic pr-1 and
pr-6 transcripts slightly enhanced significantly suppressed respectively. 
the decrease wound-induced basic pr gene expression wrk suppressed lines
was restored jasmonic acid (ja) treatment. furthermore, levels of
wound-induced enzymatic activation salicylic acid-induced protein kinase 
(sipk) wound-induced protein kinase (wipk) wound-induced accumulation 
ja reduced wrk suppressed lines comparison control line.
these results suggest wrk functions upstream sipk wipk regulates 
wound signal transduction tobacco plants.
