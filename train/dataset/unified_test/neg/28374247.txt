the development arenavirus reverse genetics provided investigators 
novel powerful approach investigation arenavirus molecular and
cell biology. use cell-based minigenome systems allowed examining 
cis- trans-acting factors involved arenavirus replication and
transcription, identification novel anti-arenaviral drug targets
without requiring use live forms arenaviruses. likewise, now
feasible rescue infectious arenaviruses entirely cloned cdnas containing 
predetermined mutations genomes investigate virus-host interactions
and mechanisms pathogenesis. advances arenavirus genetics also
facilitated screens identify anti-arenaviral drugs pursuit novel
strategies generate live-attenuated arenavirus vaccine candidates. moreover,
the generation tri-segmented (r3) arenaviruses expressing foreign genes of
interest (goi) opened possibility implementing live-attenuated
arenaviruses-based vaccine vector approaches. chapter, summarize 
the implementation plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques the
development r3 arenaviruses expressing foreign goi implementation as
vaccine vectors.
