avian leukosis virus subgroup j (alv-j), isolated late 1980s,
predominantly causes myelocytic myeloid leukosis meat-type chickens. the
past years, observed occurrence lesions indicative of
erythroblastosis alv-j-infected flocks and, paper, report the
isolation alv-j strains flocks. three isolates acutely
transforming viruses, shown ability transform bone marrow cell
cultures. bone marrow cultures transformed virus isolates 
similar myeloid cells transformed alv-j strain 966. however, the
infection meat-type chickens isolates either embryos as
1-day-old chicks resulted induction erythroblastosis well as
myelocytomatosis. histopathological changes observed inoculated
birds included neoplastic lesions cholangioma testicular cell tumour,
and non-neoplastic lesions lymphomyeloid hyperplasia. report
demonstrates highly oncogenic alv-j, capable inducing different
spectrum disease widely reported myelocytomatosis, could be
established naturally infected flocks.
