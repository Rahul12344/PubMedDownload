infection hiv-1 frequently leads pulmonary complications, including
alterations local immune environments. better understand alterations,
we examined detail patterns levels expression chemokine,
cytokine, chemokine receptor mrnas lung tissues 16 uninfected or
simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)/deltab670 infected cynomolgus macaques at
different stages infection. among up-regulated immune genes were
interferon (ifn)-gamma, ifn-gamma-inducible cxcr3 ligands, ccr5 ligands, as
well cognate chemokine receptors. changes greatest animals
with clear pneumocystis carinii coinfection. immunohistochemistry situ
hybridization revealed monocytes/macrophages predominant type cell
infiltrating lung tissues serving major cellular source of
chemokines. explore causes chemokine alterations, treated macaque
lung cells ifn-gamma, lipopolysaccharide, poly(i:c), p. carinii in
vitro, results revealed stimuli induce expression cxcr3
ligand and/or ccr5 ligand mrnas. taken together, studies provide a
comprehensive definition chemokine networks available modulate cellular
recruitment lung tissues siv infection implicate cytokines
(ifn-gamma) pathogens (siv p. carinii) contributors increased
expression pro-inflammatory chemokines.
