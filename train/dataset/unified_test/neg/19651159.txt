two rapid real-time rt-pcr assays, specific respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)
and influenza b, evaluated detection viruses in
clinical respiratory samples. rsv assay applied 100 samples the
influenza b assay applied 96 samples tested
previously "in-house" multiplex real-time pcr assay. forty-three samples
were negative rsv methods 56 samples positive both
methods. one sample negative new rsv assay although positive
for rsv "in-house" test. thirty-nine samples negative influenza
virus methods 55 samples positive assays. two samples
were negative new influenza assay however positive the
"in-house" influenza assay. new assays cross react samples
containing viruses including parainfluenza 1, 2, 4; human
metapnuemovirus; coronavirus 229e, nl63, oc43; rhinovirus; adenovirus; bocavirus 
and specificity 100% sensitivity 98.2% rsv 96.5% for
influenza respectively. results study demonstrate new assays
are specific sensitive detection rsv influenza viruses in
clinical samples.
