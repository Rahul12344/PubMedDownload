cellular factors may protect human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
infection investigated 27 hiv-exposed seronegative (esn) female sex
workers (fsws) 27 hiv-seronegative female blood donors. compared blood
donors, esn fsws significantly decreased expression levels c-x-c chemokine
receptor 4 (cxcr4), c-c chemokine receptor 5, memory (p<.001) 
and naive (p=.041) cd4(+) cells. cxcr4 down-regulation associated with
prolonged duration commercial sex work esn fsws. cd38 expression cd8(+) 
t cells significantly increased among esn fsws, compared among
blood donors (p=.017). differences hla-dr cd62l expression
between blood donors esn fsws. proportions cells producing the
beta-chemokines rantes (regulated activation, normally cell-expressed and
-secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha, mip-1beta the
cytokines interleukin (il)-2, il-4, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, similar 2 groups. data indicate esn fsws
differ hiv-seronegative female blood donors respect immunological
factors clear protective potential hiv transmission.
