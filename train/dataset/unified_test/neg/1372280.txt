an automated biosensor system designed measuring molecular interactions in
real time without labelling reactants used study the
interaction two animal viruses (vaccinia virus poliovirus) two plant
viruses (cowpea mosaic virus tobacco mosaic virus) monoclonal
antibodies. using monoclonal antibodies specific different conformational
states viral protein, found virus particles retained their
conformational integrity immobilized dextran matrix present the
sensor chip. compared conventional solid phase immunoassays, which
immobilized proteins usually partly denatured, biosensor system presents 
several advantages studying virus-antibody interaction.
