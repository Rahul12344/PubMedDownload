background: hepatitis e virus (hev) causative agent enteric non-a,
non-b hepatitis. transmission via faecal route possibility of
transmission blood raised. data concerning anti-hev prevalence among 
chronic haemodialysis (hd) patients give conflicting results.
methods: tested anti-hev antibody 204 chronic hd patients attending a
single dialysis unit. specific solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (abbott
hev eia) used.
results: found six anti-hev-positive patients, anti-hev prevalence 3% 
(95% ci 0-6%). prevalence rates hbv hcv infections 39% (31-45%)
and 22% (16-28%) respectively. anti-hev-positive patient showed past or
current biochemical signs liver damage. one six (17%) anti-hev-positive
patients immigrant; risk factor anti-hev antibody identified in
the anti-hev-positive individuals.
conclusions: observed low anti-hev prevalence: association
between hev blood-borne infections (hbv, hcv, hiv) hd patients;
most anti-hev-positive patients found probably related local
infection hev. one first reports concerning seroepidemiology of
hev infection large cohort chronic hd individuals.
