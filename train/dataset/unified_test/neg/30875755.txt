increasing evidence suggests neurodegenerative disorders share common
pathogenic feature: presence deposits misfolded proteins altered
physicochemical properties central nervous system. despite lack of
infectivity, experimental data show replication propagation of
neurodegenerative disease-related proteins including amyloid-β (aβ), tau,
α-synuclein transactive response dna-binding protein 43 kda (tdp-43)
share similar pathological mechanism prions. observations led
to terminology "prion-like" distinguish conditions with
noninfectious characteristics similarities prion replication and
propagation process. prions considered adapt conformation changes
in context environment replication. process known either
prion selection adaptation, distinct conformer present initial 
prion population higher propensity propagate new environment is
able prevail others replication process. last
years, many studies shown prion-like proteins share prion 
replication paradigm also specific ability aggregate different
conformations, i.e., strains, relevant clinical, diagnostic therapeutic 
implications. review focuses molecular basis strain phenomenon
in prion prion-like proteins.
