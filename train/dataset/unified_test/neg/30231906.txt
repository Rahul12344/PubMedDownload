background: porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv)
stability, besides meeting production targets, also requirement several 
control options prrs pig breeding farms. study aimed investigate
the frequency of, risk factors associated with, prrsv instability pig
breeding farms northern germany. 120 sow herds, questionnaire on
production management parameters filled, blood samples 30
suckling pigs 10 different litters taken examined using real-time
polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
results: prrsv detected 32 herds (27%), thus classified prrsv-unstable.
according multivariable logistic regression analysis, suckling period
≤ 21 days, low distance cadaver collection site actual sow 
barn, ≥ 2 pig herds 1000 m radius, presence external employees, time
interval purchase gilts ≤ 9 weeks 1- 2-weekly farrowing
rhythm associated higher risk prrsv instability.
conclusions: external internal biosecurity well management factors were
associated prrsv instability, could targeted farmers and
veterinarians help achieve prrsv pcr-negative status the
control prrs.
