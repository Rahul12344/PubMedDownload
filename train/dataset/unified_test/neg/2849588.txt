epstein-barr virus (ebv)-transformed human b lymphoblastoid cells share certain
properties monocytes: capable presenting protein antigens to
antigen-specific t-lymphocytes releasing interleukin 1-like factor. 
was interest study whether transformed b-cells resemble monocytes by
generating toxic oxygen radicals. human b-cell lines developed human
peripheral blood lymphocytes ebv-transformation. induction the
respiratory burst b-cells assessed chemiluminescence (cl) the
presence lucigenin. b-cells stimulated phorbol-myristate-acetate
(pma), zymosan particles, chemotactic peptide f-met-phe, complement split
product c5a recently described granulocyte activating cytokine (gram).
stimulation pma elicited distinct cl-response tested b-cell lines. 
the cl-signal significantly reduced superoxide dismutase, by
d-mannitol catalase. significant response stimuli 
detected. furthermore, none stimuli induced luminol-enhanced cl signal, 
which, contrast lucigenin, dependent presence peroxidase. 
results indicate ebv infected b-cells able generate significant
amounts reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide. appears that
virus transformation uncovers genetic information usually expressed 
in non-transformed b-cells.
