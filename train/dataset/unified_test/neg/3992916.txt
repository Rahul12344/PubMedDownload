six experiments carried aerosol immunization, using various doses
of la sota vaccine newcastle disease, control infection with
massive amounts viscerotropic virus strain pavlikeni evaluate the
duration carrying newcastle disease virus. aerosol vaccination 
birds performed laboratory conditions aerosol chamber a
flow-dynamic type 450 l. amount virus aerosol determined
through virologic investigations samples taken means glass capillary
impinger. found short-term carrier state set 9th-10th 
day la sota strain, regardless dose used age the
birds. persistence velogenic virus organs birds depended 
the amount vaccine used age birds. 2-month-old chickens at
optimal dosing vaccine resistance could built infection. when
low doses vaccine used 10-day-old chicks well when
over-dosing occurred strain pavlikeni could recovered organs in
the course 3 7 days.
