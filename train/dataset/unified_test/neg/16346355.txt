polyhedrosis virus isolated ithaca, n.y. (ldnpv-it) presented. total of
29 viral structural proteins identified sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis virus isolated the
absence alkaline protease activity. fourteen surface envelope viral proteins
were identified lactoperoxidase iodination. eleven proteins associated
with nucleocapsids prepared nonidet p-40 detergent treatment. distinct
alterations viral proteins documented virions purified the
presence occlusion body-associated alkaline protease(s). restriction enzyme
digests viral dna indicated isolate composed large number
of genetic variants. basis major molar fragments resulting from
ecori, bamhi, bglii, hindiii digests, molecular weight ldnpv
