objectives: estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (ve) 2007-2008
season assess sentinel surveillance system canada monitoring virus
evolution impact ve.
methods: nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs epidemiologic details collected from
patients presenting sentinel physician within 7 days influenza-like
illness onset. cases tested positive influenza a/b virus real-time
polymerase chain reaction; controls tested negative. hemagglutination inhibition 
(hi) gene sequencing explored virus relatedness vaccine. calculated
as 1 minus odds ratio influenza vaccinated versus nonvaccinated
participants, adjustment confounders.
results: 1425 participants, 21% vaccinated. influenza virus detected 
in 689 (48%), isolates 663 typed/subtyped: 189 (29%) were
a/h1, 210 (32%) a/h3, 264 (40%) b. a/h1n1 isolates, 6% showed
minor hi antigenic mismatch vaccine, greater variation based genetic
identity. a/h3n2 isolates showed moderate antigenic mismatch, 98% of
influenza b virus isolates showed major lineage-level mismatch vaccine.
adjusted a/h1n1, a/h3n2, b components 69% (95% confidence interval
[ci], 44%-83%), 57% (95% ci, 32%-73%), 55% (95% ci, 32%-70%), respectively,
with overall 60% (95% ci, 45%-71%).
conclusions: detailed antigenic genotypic analysis influenza viruses was
consistent epidemiologic estimates showing cross-protection. routine
sentinel surveillance system combines detailed virus monitoring
annually, modeled canada, may guide improved vaccine selection and
protection.
