antibody therapy holds great promise treatment cancer, autoimmune
disorders, viral infections. murine monoclonal antibodies relatively easy
to produce severely restricted therapeutic use their
immunogenicity humans. production human monoclonal antibodies been
problematic. humanized antibodies generated introducing six
hypervariable regions heavy light chains murine antibody a
human framework sequence combining human constant regions. we
humanized, aid computer modeling, two murine monoclonal antibodies
against herpes simplex virus gb gd glycoproteins. binding, virus
neutralization, cell protection results indicate humanized
antibodies retained binding activities biological properties 
the murine monoclonal antibodies.
