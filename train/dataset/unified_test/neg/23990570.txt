the outbreak human infections caused novel avian-origin influenza a(h7n9)
in china since march 2013 underscores need better understand the
pathogenicity transmissibility viruses mammals. ferret
model, pathogenicity influenza a(h7n9) found less of
an influenza a(h5n1) strain comparable 2009 pandemic influenza
a(h1n1), based clinical signs, mortality, virus dissemination, results
of histopathologic analyses. influenza a(h7n9) could replicate upper and
lower respiratory tract, heart, liver, olfactory bulb. is
worth noting influenza a(h7n9) exhibited low level transmission between
ferrets via respiratory droplets. 4 mutations virus isolated
from contact ferret: d678y gene encoding pb2, r157k gene
encoding hemagglutinin (h3 numbering), i109t gene encoding nucleoprotein, 
and t10i gene encoding neuraminidase. data emphasized that
avian-origin influenza a(h7n9) transmitted mammals, highlighting
its potential human-to-human transmissibility.
