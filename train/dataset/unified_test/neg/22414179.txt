background: pediatric adenovirus respiratory infections mild and
indistinguishable viral causes. however, children, the
disease severe result substantial morbidity. describe the
epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic features outcome adenovirus lower
respiratory tract infections (lrti) aboriginal non-aboriginal children 
manitoba, canada years 1991 2005.
methods: retrospective study 193 children presented the
department pediatrics winnipeg children's hospital, manitoba, canada with
lrti positive respiratory culture adenovirus. patients'
demographics, clinical radiologic features outcomes collected.
adenovirus serotype distributions temporal associations described.
approximate incidence comparisons (detection rates) adenovirus lrti among
aboriginal non-aboriginal children estimated 95% confidence
intervals.
results: adenovirus infections occurred throughout year clusters 
fall winter. serotypes 1 3 predominant isolates (two thirds of
the cases). infection frequent among canadian aboriginals, as
illustrated 2004, incidence children 0-4 years old 5.6 fold
higher aboriginals (13.51 vs. 2.39 per 10,000, p < 0.000). no
significant differences length hospitalization use ventilator
assistance two groups (p > 0.185 p > 0.624, respectively) nor
across serotypes (p > 0.10 p > 0.05, respectively). disease primarily
affected infants (median age, 9.5 months). children presented with
bronchiolitis pneumonia, multi-lobar consolidations chest x-ray.
chronic (residual) changes documented 16 patients, eight patients
showing bronchiectasis chest computerized tomography scan.
conclusions: adenovirus infection associated significant respiratory
morbidities, especially young infants. infection appears more
frequent aboriginal children. results justify careful follow-up for
children adenovirus lrti.
