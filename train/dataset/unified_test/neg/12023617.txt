background: blockade cd40-cd40 ligand (cd154) costimulatory pathway with
anti-cd154 antibody (ab) prolongs allograft survival experimental organ
transplantations; however, repeated agent administration needed provide 
adequate immunosuppression. seeking simple effective approach to
interfere signaling, applied adenovirus-mediated gene therapy encoding
cd40ig gene (adcd40ig).
methods: liver graft aci (rt1av1) rat transplanted orthotopically into
lew (rt1l) rat, adcd40ig given animals via penile vein immediately
after grafting (n=6).
results: single treatment adcd40ig 1x10(9) plaque forming units induced
specific expression cd40ig gene allograft liver, produced substantial
amount protein sera, allowed indefinite graft survival.
whereas, lew recipients given treatment control adenovirus vector (adlacz) 
promptly rejected aci liver. addition, adcd40ig-treated, long-term survivors
accepted skin graft donor strain third party graft.
histopathology revealed liver structure long-term surviving animals
was completely preserved normal infiltration mononuclear cells.
conclusion: blockade cd40-cd154 pathway cd40ig gene therapy potent
alloantigen-specific immunosuppressive strategy induce permanent acceptance of
liver allograft would new therapeutic candidate clinical liver
transplantation.
