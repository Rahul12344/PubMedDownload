this observational study evaluated characteristics genotype 4 chronic
hepatitis c (chc) patients response combination therapy spain.
383 patients chc, 44 genotype 4-hcv infection, investigated.
nineteen genotype 4-hcv infected patients received ifnalpha-2b (3 mu three times 
weekly) plus ribavirin (1-1.2 g/day) ten received peg-ifnalpha-2b (1.5
microg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (1-1.2 g/day) 12 months. sustained
virological response (svr) evaluated. genotype 4-hcv detected 11.5% of
patients, significantly associated higher proportion infection 
through intravenous drug use (46% vs 11%; p<0.001), higher alcohol intake (35% 
vs. 7%; p<0.001), higher proportion anti-hbc positivity (41% vs. 22%; p<0.05),
lower alt (87+/-50 vs. 139+/-142 iu/l; p<0.001) ast (53+/-30 vs. 85+/-126
iu/l; p<0.001) levels, lower viremia (4.1 +/- 7.7 (x 10(5)) vs . 7.3 +/- 9.8 iu(x
10(5) )/ml) p<0.05) less fibrosis (stage 3-4 21% vs. 32%; p<0.06). sixteen
(55%) 29 patients treated combination therapy achieved a
sustained virological response (svr) 10 (36%) non-responders 3 (9%
relapsed. conclusion, lower stage fibrosis, lower viremia higher
svr rate genotype 1 suggest less aggressive pattern diseased caused 
this genotype.
