despite wide armamentarium available human immunodeficiency
virus, efficacy therapeutic molecules reduced selection of
resistant viral strains. several data argue favour early control of
viral replication ever since first treatment: intensity initial
viral replication, well results studies antiretroviral drugs given as
first line treatment early inhibitory response viral replication.
although early control essential long-term antiviral success, the
optimal time limit virologic response still needs established early
knowledge virologic response could prove useful evaluation new
and successful therapeutic combinations. nevertheless, impact an
earlier control viral replication long-term treatment efficacy the
prevention resistance emergence deserves investigation.
