introduction: tt virus recently isolated japan patients acute
and chronic non-a/non-g hepatitis. possible etiopathogenetic role causing 
hepatitis initially taken consideration. contrary, recent
studies deny importance tt virus causing liver damage. the
studies based serological data viral detection frozen liver
tissue.
aim study: present paper describe method detect viral
genome formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue.
materials methods: twelve needle biopsies liver studied. six cases 
were selected basis serological negativity hbv hcv markers.
five cases hcv-related chronic hepatitis one hcv- hiv-positive
intravenous drug abuser also included. patients underwent liver biopsy, 
performed 14-g needle. liver specimens formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded routine. block, sections cut stained 
histopathologic examination. additional 5 microns sections employed to
extract dna nested pcr.
results: 2 12 cases studied, tt virus genome found. cases the
presence viral dna confirmed sequencing. patients male. the
first patient 39-year-old hiv- hcv-positive intravenous drug abuser.
the second patient 60-year-old heavy alcohol drinker. cases the
presence tt virus apparently affect histological picture.
conclusion: possible detect tt virus genome formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tissue. method offers possibility perform
retrospective studies.
