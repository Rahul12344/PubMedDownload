one main focus areas transgenesis choice promoter driving
stable expression time gene interest. besides promoter identity,
the genomic environment transgene plays pivotal role transcription
regulation. studies higher mammals describing transgene expression a
defined locus limited. set determine expression pattern of
two transgene promoters, human pdgfβ viral sv40, single cassette
positioned largest intron porcine glis3 locus. pdgfβ promoter
drives variant amyloid precursor protein gene named app695sw the
sv40 promoter drives neomycin resistant gene, neo. nested gene scenario
was investigated three transgenic cloned pigs sacrificed 3 months, 2 years 
and 3 years age. identical genetic make-up environment, the
three individual pigs considered representative 3 year lifespan a
single pig. selected organs pigs analyzed quantitative rt-pcr
for transgene promoter activity well endogenous glis3 promoter activity. no
apparent effect transgene cassette observed endogenous glis3
expression. addition, one year old homozygous pigs showed phenotypic signs 
of dysfunctional glis3. transgene promoters showed retained tissue
specificity stable expression time. study indicates transgenes
inserted nested situation might applicable faithful long term
transgene expression.
