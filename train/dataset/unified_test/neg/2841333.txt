human t-cells (h9), persistently infected htlv-iii strain human
immunodeficiency virus, metabolically labeled d-[2-3h]mannose or
d-[6-3h]glucosamine. viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, isolated either 
from cell lysates cell-free culture supernatant. proteolytic
digestion, radiolabeled oligosaccharides sequentially liberated from
glycopeptides treatment endo-beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase h and
peptide:n-glycosidase f. oligosaccharides released separated residual
(glyco)peptides fractionated according size, charge, fucose content.
the individual oligosaccharide species obtained characterized digestion
with exoglycosidases chromatographic comparison standard
oligosaccharides. results demonstrate intracellular gp120 carries
predominantly oligomannosidic glycans comprising nine eight mannose residues. 
the secreted glycoprotein equally substituted oligomannosidic species,
containing seven nine mannose residues, fucosylated, partially
sialylated bi- triantennary complex-type oligosaccharides.
