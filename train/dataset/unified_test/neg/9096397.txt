the subgroup c adenoviruses (ad) group b coxsackieviruses (cvb)
are structurally unrelated viruses known compete unidentified 
cell surface receptor. describe isolation cdnas human and
mouse encode human cvb ad2 5 receptor (hcar) mouse cvb
ad2 5 receptor (mcar). 46-kda glycoproteins whose primary amino acid
sequences highly homologous. structurally, hcar mcar appear be
transmembrane proteins contain two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains
and therefore belong superfamily. transfection either cdna
molecules receptor-negative nih 3t3 cells conferred susceptibility cvb
infection permitted expression beta-galactosidase recombinant
ad5 vector. addition, hcar mcar mrnas could detected northern blots 
of oligo(dt)-selected rna receptor-positive hela cells tcmk-1 well as
several tissues human mouse origin known targets ad and
cvb infections. finally, western blots using antibodies inhibit virus
binding either human mouse cvb receptors detected 46-kda proteins in
hcar- mcar-transfected cells, respectively. taken together, results
confirm isolated cdnas encode receptors subgroup c ad and
cvb.
