objective: two kinds murine interleukin-12 (mil-12) fusion gene vaccines 
used treat murine low-load malignant cell lymphoma el4 minimal
residual disease (mrd) model.
methods: c57bl/6 synergistical mice subcutaneously inoculated 1 x 10(6)
wild-type (wt) el4 tumor cells low-load lymphoma model treated two mil-12
gene vaccines. package cell line pa317/12 producing mil-12 retrovirus (rv) was
used vivo vaccine el4 tumor cells transferred mil-12 gene ex
vivo vaccine.
results: mil-12 gene vaccine-treated groups, tumor growth in
50% mice 60 days inoculation. nine tumor growth mice were
re-challenged 5 x 10(5) wt el4 cells, 5 survived without tumors 
in another 60 days. control mice died tumors within one month after
inoculation. among developed tumors vaccine-treated groups, the
development tumors delayed, survival period prolonged (p < 0.01), 
the tumors size death smaller (p < 0.05) compared controls. the
long-survived vaccine-treated mice, residual tumor cells found by
morphological examination.
conclusion: il-12 gene vaccines efficiently eliminate wt el4 mrd in
c57bl/6 mice.
