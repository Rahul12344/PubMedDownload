in immunocompromised patients, infection kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (kshv) give rise kaposi's sarcoma several
lymphoproliferative disorders. tumors, kshv establishes latent
infection many rapidly proliferating morphologically abnormal
cells. viral gene products expressed latent virus, one 
of best characterized latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana), a
nuclear protein required maintenance viral episomal dna the
dividing host cell. lana also activate repress assortment cellular
and viral promoters may contribute pathogenesis allowing the
proliferation survival host cells. show activation the
human e2f1 cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (cdk2) promoters requires elements 
both n- c-terminal regions lana. deletion first 22 amino acids,
which necessary episome tethering, affect nuclear localization
but significantly reduces transactivation. within deleted peptide, have
identified short sequence, termed chromatin-binding motif (cbm), binds
tightly interphase mitotic chromatin. second chromatin-binding activity 
resides c terminus sufficient optimal transactivation.
alanine substitutions within cbm reveal close correlation the
transactivation chromatin binding activities, implying mechanistic link. in
contrast promoter activation, find 223 amino acids lana c
terminus sufficient inhibit p53-mediated activation human bax
promoter, indicating cbm required transcription-related
functions.
