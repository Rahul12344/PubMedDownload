aims: duck enteritis virus (dev) member family herpesviridae, the
genome completely analyzed. order provide insights 
into genomic organization, decided amplify unknown sequence 
us region since three key glycoproteins coded region. glycoprotein 
encoded us6 gene essential virus entry plays important role in
protecting animals lethal challenge. glycoprotein e encoded us7 and
us8 gene required cell-to-cell spread.
methods: single oligonucleotide nested polymerase chain reaction adopted to
amplify unknown sequence. open reading frames (orf) predicted by
editseq program. sequence submitted online program search
promoter, polyadenylation signal potential n-glycosylation sites. the
phylogenetic analysis performed mega4.1, multiple alignments were
performed clustalx.
results: three complete orfs including us6, us7 us8 determined. the
three genes shared polyadenylation signal. phylogenetic analysis showed 
that dev closed mardivirus alphaherpesvirus.
conclusion: results extend understanding dev genome its
classification, also provide basic knowledge functional
investigations proteins us region.
