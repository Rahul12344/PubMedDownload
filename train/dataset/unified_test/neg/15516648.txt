west nile virus (wnv) strains circulating first five years wnv
transmission new york collected, partial nucleotide sequences were
determined, vitro vivo phenotypic analyses selected strains were
undertaken determine whether observed increases intensity enzootic
and epidemic transmission new york state 2002 2003 associated 
with viral genetic changes. functionally diverse regions wnv genome were
also compared determine whether regions may less variable than
others. complete envelope coding regions 67 strains fragments the
nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) 3' noncoding regions 39 strains collected
during 2002 2003 examined. west nile virus new york remains
relatively genetically homogeneous. viral genetic diversity greater 2002
and 2003 nucleotide amino acid levels previous years due 
to emergence new wnv genotype 2002. genotype persisted and
became dominant 2003. envelope ns5 coding regions approximately
two-fold likely 3' untranslated region contain nucleotide
substitutions, envelope region approximately three-fold likely
to contain amino acid substitutions ns5 region. variation noted in
in vivo mosquito transmission assays, vitro growth studies. strains
belonging epizootiologically dominant clade transmitted after
approximately two fewer days extrinsic incubation, providing possible
mechanism dominance clade. observed increase intensity
of wnv transmission beginning 2002 associated increase viral
genetic diversity result emergence additional
phylogenetic clade. genotype seems possess advantage previously
recognized wnv strains mosquito transmission phenotype.
