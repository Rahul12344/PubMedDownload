to better understand potential antagonistic interactions members 
of bacterial species, surveyed bacteriocin killing activity
across diverse suite strains phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae. 
data demonstrate killing activity phage-derived bacteriocins p.
syringae (r-type syringacins) widespread. despite high overall diversity 
bacteriocin activity, strains broadly classified five main killing
types two main sensitivity types. furthermore, show killing activity 
switches frequently strains switches correlate localized
recombination two genes together encode proteins specify
bacteriocin targeting. lastly, demonstrate phage-derived bacteriocin
killing activity swapped strains simply expression of
these two genes trans. overall, study characterizes extensive diversity of
killing activity phage-derived bacteriocins p. syringae across strains and
highlights power localized recombination alter phenotypes mediate 
strain interactions evolution natural populations communities.
