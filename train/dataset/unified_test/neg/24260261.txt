reconstruction host-pathogen protein interaction networks great
significance reveal underlying microbic pathogenesis. however, current
experimentally-derived networks generally small augmented by
computational methods less-biased biological inference. point of
view computational modelling, data scarcity, data unavailability negative 
data sampling three major problems host-pathogen protein interaction 
networks reconstruction. work, motivated address three
concerns propose probability weighted ensemble transfer learning model 
hiv-human protein interaction prediction (pwen-tlm), support vector machine
(svm) adopted individual classifier ensemble model. the
model, data scarcity data unavailability tackled homolog knowledge
transfer. importance homolog knowledge measured roc-auc metric
of individual classifiers, whose outputs probability weighted yield
the final decision. addition, validate assumption the
homolog knowledge sufficient train satisfactory model host-pathogen
protein interaction prediction. thus model robust data
unavailability less demanding data constraint. regards negative data
construction, experiments show exclusiveness subcellular co-localized
proteins unbiased reliable random sampling. last, conduct
analysis overlapped predictions model existing models, and
apply model novel host-pathogen ppis recognition biological
research.
