virophages viruses rely replication machinery viruses to
reproduce within eukaryotic hosts. two different modes coinfection been
posited based experimental observation. one mode, virophage the
virus enter host independently. mode, virophage adheres to
the virus virophage virus enter host together. ask: 
are ecological effects different modes coinfection? in
particular, ecological effects common infection modes, 
are differences particular mode? develop pair biophysically
motivated ode models viral-host population dynamics, corresponding dynamics
arising mode infection. find modes coinfection allow
for coexistence virophage, virus, host either stable fixed
point cyclical dynamics. models, virophage tends the
most abundant population presence always reduces viral abundance
and increases host abundance. however, find qualitative differences
between models. example, via extensive sampling biologically relevant
parameter space, observe bistability virophage virus
enter host together. discuss differences may leveraged help
identify modes infection natural environments population level data.
