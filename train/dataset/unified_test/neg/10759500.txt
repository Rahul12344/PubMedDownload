geranylgeranyl diphosphate (ggpp) precursor biosynthesis of
gibberellins, carotenoids, chlorophylls, isoprenoid quinones, and
geranylgeranylated proteins plants. small gene family ggpp
synthases encoding five isozymes one related protein arabidopsis, 
homologs putative localization signal translocate specific
subcellular compartments. using synthetic green fluorescent protein (sgfp), 
studied subcellular localization ggpp synthases. fusion
proteins expressed cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter in
arabidopsis, ggps1-sgfp ggps3-sgfp proteins translocated the
chloroplast, ggps2-sgfp ggps4-sgfp proteins localized endoplasmic
reticulum, ggps6-sgfp protein localized mitochondria. both
ggps1 ggps3 proteins synthesized vitro taken isolated intact 
pea chloroplasts processed mature form. rna-blot and
promoter-beta-glucuronidase (gus) analysis showed ggpp synthases genes
are organ-specifically expressed arabidopsis. ggr ggps1 ubiquitously 
expressed, ggps2, ggps3, ggps4 expressed specifically the
flower, root, flower, respectively. results suggest ggpp
synthase gene expressed different tissues plant development ggpp
is synthesized organelles rather transported into
the organelles. therefore, predict specific pathways ggpp
production organelle.
