from mycobacterium phlei, glycolipid fractions isolated which
inactivate phage phlei. basis characteristics inactivation
(specificity, kinetics, requirement ca++) typical phage-host cell
system, concluded fractions contain receptor sites for
phage phlei ; conclusion supported electron microscopic studies. 
the active fractions contain four kinds components : fatty acids, glycerol,
sugars (d-lyxose, 6-0-methyl-d-glucose, low amounts glucose mannose), 
and water-soluble acids. acids isolated degradation receptor 
fractions oxalic pyruvic acids. variations ratio oxalic
acid/pyruvic acid according mode degradation absence the
peak characteristic protons pyruvic acid residue nmr spectrum,
suggest acids might arise splitting oxaloacetic acid. a
tentative structure receptor proposed, many monoglycerides are
linked keto-acid polysaccharide core.
