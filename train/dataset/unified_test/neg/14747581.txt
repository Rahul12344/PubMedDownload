the role fas-mediated lysis hepatocytes hepatitis c virus (hcv)-induced 
injury frequently discussed. therefore analyzed effect number of
hcv antigen-expressing cells, mode antigen presentation, number of
cytotoxic lymphocytes coculture system mimicking cellular components of
the liver. here, show endogenously processed hcv proteins capable 
inducing bystander killing. demonstrate 0.8 1.5% cells
presenting hcv antigens suffice induce lysis 10 29% bystander cells, 
suggesting mechanism may operative low fractions infected
versus uninfected hepatocytes vivo. data underscore role fas
pathway hcv-related liver injury support exploration fas-based
treatment strategies patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection.
