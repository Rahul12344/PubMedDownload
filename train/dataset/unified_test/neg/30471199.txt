glycyrrhizin used treat chronic hepatitis, also plays important
role pseudoaldosteronism. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 is
important glycyrrhizin excretion. dysfunction transporter increases
the serum levels direct bilirubin, glycyrrhizin metabolites. hence,
elevated direct-bilirubin levels could predict risk pseudoaldosteronism.
this study aimed evaluate relationship elevated direct-bilirubin
levels hypokalaemia, sensitive marker of
pseudoaldosteronism. retrospective cohort study conducted japanese 
university hospital. occurrence hypokalaemia defined serum
potassium level ≤3.5 meq/l administration a
glycyrrhizin-containing medication, decline ≥0.5 meq/l an
increase ≥0.5 meq/l discontinuing glycyrrhizin-containing medication
was examined patients chronic hepatitis january 2009 december
2015. analysis involved 1392 patients, including 596 women. hepatitis c
virus infections common cause chronic hepatitis study.
seventy-nine patients received glycyrrhizin (exposed group; mean age:
60.5 ± 14.2) 1313 receive glycyrrhizin (control group; mean age:
58.3 ± 15.8 years). synergistic effects glycyrrhizin-containing medications
and elevated direct-bilirubin levels associated hypokalaemia. elevated 
direct-bilirubin levels hypoalbuminaemia associated hypokalaemia in
the exposed group. older age, female sex, high daily glycyrrhizin dosage, longer 
duration glycyrrhizin intake, potassium-lowering medications not
associated hypokalaemia model adjustment. elevated
direct-bilirubin levels hypoalbuminaemia may predict pseudoaldosteronism
caused glycyrrhizin.
