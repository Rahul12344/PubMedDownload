we compared cell cycle status expression mrna amphotropic
retroviral receptor hematopoietic stem cells isolated bone marrow and
cytokine mobilized peripheral blood. cd34+ cells six normal volunteers 
enriched immune selection steady-state bone marrow granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) mobilized peripheral blood (10 microg/kg/day
for 5 days). cell cycle status phenotypically primitive cd34+cd38-
hematopoietic stem cell population analyzed using four-color flow cytometry
technique distinguished g0, g1, s/ig2/m phases cell cycle.
semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed to
measure mrna expression amphotropic retroviral receptor. peripheral blood 
hematopoietic stem cells 2.6-fold cells g1 phase cell
cycle compared steady-state bone marrow. furthermore, lineage cd34+cd38- cells
from g-csf mobilized peripheral blood fourfold higher level amphotropic 
retrovirus receptor mrna. conclusion, found cd34+ cd38- hematopoietic 
stem cells isolated g-csf mobilized peripheral blood differ those
isolated steady-state bone marrow significant proportion have
entered g1 phase cell cycle express higher levels amphotropic
receptor mrna. biologic properties consistent reported rapid
recovery hematopoietic function following transplantation peripheral
blood hematopoietic stem cells make cells preferred target for
retroviral-based gene transfer.
