natural killer (nk) cells provide one initial barriers cellular host
defense pathogens, particular intracellular pathogens. role of
these cells foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) infection unknown.
previously, characterized phenotype function nk cells swine
(f. n. toka et al., j. interferon cytokine res. 29:179-192, 2009). present
study, report analysis nk cells isolated animals infected with
fmdv tested ex vivo show nk-dependent cytotoxic activity against
tumor cells targets impaired. relevantly infection, the
killing target cells infected fmdv also inhibited. further, the
proportion nk cells capable producing gamma interferon storing perforin
was reduced. peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated infected animals
are productively infected, virus exposure vivo resulted the
significant induction nkp30 toll-like receptor 3 expression the
moderate activation socs3 interleukin-15 receptor mrna. however, was
little alteration mrna expression number receptor genes in
these cells, including sh2d1b nkg2a (inhibitory) well nkp80, nkp46, and
nkg2d (activating). data indicate virus infection influences 
ability nk cells recognize eliminate fmdv-infected cells. addition, 
a reduction nk cell cytotoxicity coincided increase virus titers, 
indicating virus blocking nk cell-associated innate responses, albeit
temporarily. effects likely culminate brief effective viral immune
evasion, allowing virus replicate disseminate within host.
