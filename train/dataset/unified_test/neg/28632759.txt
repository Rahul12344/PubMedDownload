pcr amplicon next generation sequencing (ngs) analysis offers broadly
applicable targeted approach detect populations high- or
low-frequency virus variants one plant samples. study,
amplicon ngs used explore diversity tripartite genome virus,
prunus necrotic ringspot virus (pnrsv) 53 pnrsv-infected trees using
amplicons conserved gene regions pnrsv rna1, rna2 rna3.
sequencing amplicons 53 pnrsv-infected trees revealed differing
levels polymorphism across three different components pnrsv genome 
with total number 5040, 2083 5486 sequence variants observed rna1,
rna2 rna3 respectively. rna2 lowest diversity sequences
compared rna1 rna3, reflecting lack flexibility tolerated the
replicase gene encoded rna component. distinct pnrsv
phylo-groups, consisting closely related clusters sequence variants, were
observed pnrsv rna1, rna2 rna3. plant samples single
phylo-group rna component. haplotype network analysis showed that
smaller clusters pnrsv sequence variants genetically connected the
largest sequence variant cluster within phylo-group rna component. some
plant samples sequence variants occurring multiple pnrsv phylo-groups in
at least one rna phylo-groups formed distinct clades that
represent pnrsv genetic strains. variants within phylo-group each
prunus plant sample ≥97% similarity phylo-groups within prunus plant
sample samples less ≤97% similarity. based analysis of
diversity, definition pnrsv genetic strain proposed. proposed
definition applied determine number pnrsv genetic strains each
of plant samples complexity defining genetic strains in
multipartite genome viruses explored.
