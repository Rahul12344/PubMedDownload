the magnitude lymphocytosis following exercise directly related exercise
intensity. infection cytomegalovirus (cmv) also augments lymphocytosis after
exercise. known enhanced t-cell response exercise due cmv 
depends exercise intensity. furthermore, exercise-induced changes t-cell
expression type type ii cytokines thought intensity dependent,
but direct comparisons lacking. aim experiment determine
if cmv affects exercise-induced redistribution t-cell subsets varying
intensities, determine effect exercise intensity cd8+ t-cell
cytokine expression. seventeen cyclists (nine cmv seropositive; cmv+) completed
three 30 min cycling trials -5, +5, +15% blood lactate threshold (lt). 
t-cell subsets blood intracellular expression type (il-2,
interferon(ifn)-γ) type ii (il-4, il-10) cytokines cd8+ cells pre, post,
and 1-h post-exercise assessed flow cytometry. independently cmv,
t-cell subset redistribution greater +15%lt compared -5%lt
(p < 0.05). independently intensity, cmv- mobilized low- (cd27+ cd28+)
and medium- (cd27+ cd28-) differentiated cells cmv+, whereas cmv+
mobilized high (cd27- cd28-) differentiated cells. numbers il-2+,
ifn-γ+, il-4+, il-10+ cd8+ cells increased exercise lt only
type cytokine expression influenced exercise intensity (p < 0.05). in
conclusion, t-cell redeployment exercise directly related exercise
intensity, changes number cd8+ t-cells expressing type i
cytokines. although cmv+ mobilized high-differentiated cells cmv-,
this occurred intensities. therefore, augmenting effect cmv on
t-cell mobilization independent exercise intensity.
