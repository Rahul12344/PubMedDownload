background/aims: bovine lactoferrin (blf) shown prevent infection
of cultured hepatocytes hepatitis c virus (hcv). present study attempted
to clarify effects long-term administration blf serum parameters,
including immunomodulatory cytokines, patients chronic hepatitis c (chc).
methods: sixty-three chc patients randomly assigned 2 groups. an
oral dose 600 mg/day, blf administered 12 months 36 patients (blf
group), blf given remaining 27 patients (control group. serum
levels alanine aminotransferase, hcv-rna, il-10, il-18 evaluated, 
well cd4-positive cell subsets peripheral blood. results: serum
il-18 level increased blf administration, control group.
after 3 months blf treatment, significantly higher blf
administration, decreased gradually thereafter. percentage of
interferon (ifn)-gamma+ il-4- (th1) cells peripheral blood increased
along serum il-18 level, although change statistically
significant. parameters change significantly study
period groups. conclusions: results suggest oral
administration blf chc patients 3 months produce a
th1-cytokine dominant environment peripheral blood favors the
eradication hcv ifn therapy.
