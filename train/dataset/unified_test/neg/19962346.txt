b cells present idiotopes (id) b cell receptor id-specific cd4(+) t
cells. chronic id-driven t-b cell collaboration cause autoimmune disease in
mice. propose id-driven t-b cell collaboration mediates development
of multiple sclerosis perpetuating immune responses initiated against
infectious agents. germinal centre reactions, b cells express multitude 
of mutated ids. mutations lead decreased affinity deletion of
the b cell, b cells could rescued id-specific cells. such
id-connected t-b cell pairs might initiate inflammatory foci central
nervous system. model may explain intrathecal synthesis low-avidity
igg viruses, synthesis oligoclonal igg unknown
