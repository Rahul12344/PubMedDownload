plasma hiv viremia suppressed maintained limits detection
for prolonged periods time vast majority hiv-infected individuals
who receive antiretroviral therapy (art). thus, clinical outcome for
hiv-infected individuals access drugs dramatically improved.
however, art alone cannot eradicate hiv infected individuals this
impediment likely part due persistence viral reservoirs the
peripheral blood lymphoid tissues infected individuals despite the
suppression plasma viremia. recent years, major research efforts 
dedicated better understanding pathogenesis persistent hiv
infection development therapeutic strategies aimed eradicating
virus infected individuals receiving art. review, discuss the
pathophysiology cd4 t-cell hiv reservoirs, including recent advances our
understanding mechanisms persistent viral infection perspectives
for eradication hiv infected individuals.
