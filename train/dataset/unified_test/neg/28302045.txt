backgrounds: pharmacotherapy surgery constitute mainstay treatment for
inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). post-treatment relapsing recurrence
persist concerns patients ibd. stem cell therapy (sct) emerged 
a promising treatment strategy inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including
hematopoietic stem cells (hst), mensenchymal stem cells (mscs). however, severe
complications limit clinical use sct ibd. therefore, review aims
to summarize sct-associated complications, illustrate possible prevention
strategies.
methods: searched pubmed studies reported use sct treat
patients ibd. searching terms included 'ibd' 'inflammatory bowel disease'
or 'cd' 'crohn's disease' 'stem cell therapy' 'stem cell
transplantation'.
results: hsct restore immune tolerance following chemotherapy-induced
immune ablation, mscs could affect immune cells secret trophic factors 
treat ibd. however, severe complications limit clinical use sct ibd.
dominant sct-associated complications include infection, ectopic tissues, and
graft-versus-host disease (gvhd), especially auto-hsct. infection,
bacteremia virus infection found sct treatment, use of
anti-microbial regimens could reduce incidences infection. ectopic tissue
formation recipient observed treatment hsct msc. homing 
and tissue integration might possible mechanisms forming ectopic
tissues. addition, gvhd also observed allogeneic hsct. therefore,
autologous hsct mscs transplantation recommended avoid gvhd.
conclusions: mscs low immunogenicity property eliminate need for
chemotherapy, hsct reducing risk severe complications. for
better application sct ibd, antimicrobial prophylaxis used
combined sct.
