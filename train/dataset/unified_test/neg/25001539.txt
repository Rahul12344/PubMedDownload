orctl3, organic cation/anion transporter expressed various tissue types,
was isolated genome-wide cdna screen gene tumor-specific
apoptosis activity. overexpressed elicits apoptosis response many
transformed cells, normal cells remain unaffected. activated 
apoptosis induction individual tumorigenic mutations renal cells. this
effect independent tumor cells' proliferation status mediated an
incomplete er stress response, characterized accumulation the
endoplasmic reticulum-stress marker atf4, bip. recent studies show that
for apoptosis induction activity orctl3 targets enzyme stearoyl-coa
desaturase-1 (scd-1) involved fatty acid metabolism. is
evidenced inhibition apoptosis induced orctl3 scd-1
product oleic acid exogenously supplemented scd-1 co-transfected in
the transformed cells. orctl3's activity specifically target tumor cells is
caused transmembrane domains 3 4 mouse, human,
gene. vivo model orctl3 shows significant shrinkage size of
xenograft tumors injected adenoviral carrier carrying mouse
orctl3 gene. ex vivo study using human renal cancer cells confirmed the
promising tumor-specific apoptosis effect orctl3. since orctl3 targets fatty
acid metabolism transformed cells induces er stress specifically in
these cells, reveals novel therapeutic interference option tumor cells.
