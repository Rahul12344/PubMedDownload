the amino terminus human papillomavirus (hpv) minor capsid protein l2 harbors 
several conserved neutralizing epitopes, including aa.17-36 (rg-1 epitope) and
aa.65-85 consensus epitope (cl2 epitope), considered promising
for construction cost-effective pan-hpv vaccine candidates. however, the
immunogenicity l2 epitope/peptide rather weak, neutralizing
spectrum induced single type l2 antigen suboptimal. study, we
constructed l2 concatemer hpv18/33/58/59 rg-1 epitopes 16l2 aa.11-88
peptide, fused flagellin, strong systemic mucosal adjuvant, 
hypervariable region replacement. copy cl2 epitope also introduced to
the c-terminus recombinant protein. resultant fla-5pcl2 protein be
produced e. coli expression system high yield good stability. we
assessed immunogenicity fla-5pcl2 mouse model via systemic mucosal 
route, found subcutaneous immunization fla-5pcl2 induced robust
serum neutralizing antibodies divergent hpv types, intranasal
immunization fla-5pcl2 induced remarkable l2-specific iga and
cross-neutralizing antibodies mucosal secretions, medium titers of
cross-neutralizing antibodies sera. moreover, fla-5pcl2 induced full
protection vaginal hpv challenges. mucosal antibodies provide the
first-line defense infection sites, needle-free immunizations may increase
vaccine compliance require less public health resources, results
demonstrate fla-5pcl2 promising vaccine candidate possibly meet
the need low-resource regions.
