two unrelated patients gata2-haploinsufficiency developed hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (hlh)-like disease varicella zoster virus (vzv)
infection. high copy numbers vzv detected blood, patients 
were successfully treated acyclovir intravenous immunoglobulins. after
treatment corticosteroids hlh, patients made full recovery.
although mechanisms leading disease constellation yet be
characterized, hypothesize impairment immunoregulatory role nk 
cells gata2-haploinsufficiency may accentuated patients'
susceptibility hlh. expansion double negative t-lymphocytic population
identified cytof could factor contributing hlh these
patients. first report vzv-triggered hlh-like disease primary
immunodeficiency third report hlh gata2-haploinsufficiency. since
hlh part presentation one patients, gata2-haploinsufficiency
represents potential differential diagnosis patients presenting the
clinical features hlh-especially cases persisting cytopenia after
recovery hlh.
