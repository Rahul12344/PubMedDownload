reverse transcriptase pauses n2-methylguanine vitro transcription of
escherichia coli 16s ribosomal rna.

youvan dc, hearst je.

a restriction fragment strand complementary sequence near 3' end of
escherichia coli 16s rrna used prime reverse transcriptase (avian
myeloblastosis virus rna-directed dna nucleotidyltransferase;
deoxynucleosidetriphosphate:dna deoxynucleotidyltransferase, ec 2.7.7.7). in
addition transcripts extended 5' end rna, two major
transcription intermediates observed. discrete-sized cdna
intermediates result kinetic barrier imposed monomethylation of
the amino group guanine participates base-pairing. major
transcription intermediates correspond attenuation known positions of
n2-methylguanine (m2g) rrna sequence. relaxation time elongation
of cdna m2g approximately 3 min. major kinetic pauses
were observed 1340 bases transcribed.
