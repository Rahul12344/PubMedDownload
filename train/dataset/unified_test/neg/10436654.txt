it reported production il-2 ifn-gamma, known t-helper
type 1 cytokines, peripheral mononuclear cells (pbmc) decreases with
progression hiv infection. contrast, il-4 il-10 production, th2
cytokine profile, increases hiv disease progression. pbmc evaluated
from 55 hiv-infected subjects divisão de imunologia, hospital das clínicas, 
faculdade de medicina da universidade de são paulo, "in vitro" cytokines
production 24 hours stimulation pha. low levels il-4 production 
in hiv-infected patients normal subjects, detected. patients
with cd4+ cell counts < 200 showed significant decrease il-2 ifn-gamma
production compared controls. patients higher counts cd4+ cells
(either 200-500 > 500 cells/mm3) also showed decreased production of
il-2 statistically significant. correlation il-2
and ifn-gamma release cd4+ cells counts. hiv-1-infected individuals with
cd4+ cells > 500 cells/mm3 showed increased levels il-2 ifn-gamma, 
individuals cd4+ cells < 500 cells/mm3. conclusion, observed a
decline il-2 ifn-gamma production advanced hiv disease. il-4 production
was affected hiv infection. taken together, findings suggest
that cytokine profile might influenced hiv infection rather than
the cause disease progression.
