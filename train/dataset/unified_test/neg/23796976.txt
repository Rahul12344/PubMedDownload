background objective: hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related cirrhosis known to
be associated chronic hepatic inflammation. present study aimed to
examine correlation inflammatory mediators inf-γ, il-17, sicam-1 
in hbv cirrhotic patients.
methods: levels sicam-1, interleukin-17, ifn-γ measured with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 120 cirrhotic patients hbv 270
sex- age-matched healthy controls. total bilirubin (tb) measured 
association tb ifn-γ, sicam-1, interleukin-17 analyzed. the
levels cytokines serum association ifn-γ sicam-1 
as well interleukin-17 investigated. relationships these
cytokines child-pugh classes analyzed patients.
results: age sex similar, tb values significantly different
between two groups (p<0.001). serum levels sicam-1, interleukin-17, and
ifn-γ significantly higher cirrhotic patients hbv controls
(p<0.001 both). tb levels positively correlated ifn-γ,
interleukin-17 sicam-1 levels. significantly positive correlations also 
found ifn-γ interleukin-17 well sicam-1 (r=0.817 r=0.561,
respectively, p<0.01). significant differences studied
cytokines (sicam-1, interleukin-17, ifn-γ) child-pugh classes (p<0.01).
conclusions: increased ifn-γ level correlated il-17 and
sicam-1, may primarily play role cytokines trigger liver injury.
both il-17 sicam-1 may synergistically contribute liver damage.
