balb/cj mouse mast cells derived culturing bone marrow progenitor cells in
wehi-3 cell-conditioned medium (bmmcw) contain mouse mast cell protease 2 
(mmcp-2) mrna, cells induced express transcript after
exposure ril-10. study translation granule accumulation mmcp-2
in ril-10-treated bmmc (bmmcw+il-10), rabbit antibody developed a
synthetic peptide corresponds novel amino acid sequence mmcp-2 
residues 56 71. affinity purification, antibody, anti-mmcp-2(56-71)
igg, reacted sds-page/immunoblots 28-kda protein bmmcw+il-10 that
had n-terminal amino acid sequence mmcp-2. assessed
immunohistochemically, mmcp-2 protein accumulated secretory granules of
kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mouse mast cells, bmmcw+il-10, mucosal
mast cells present jejunum trichinella spiralis-infected balb/cj mice. 
time course analyses induction mmcp-2 mrna protein bmmcw+il-10
revealed cells contain high steady-state level mmcp-2 mrna 24 h
after exposure ril-10. although small amount immunodetectable
mmcp-2 protein present cells treated 24 h, large amounts this
protease obtained 7 days treatment cells ril-10.
time course analyses loss mmcp-2 mrna protein bmmcw+il-10
revealed steady-state level mmcp-2 mrna decreased dramatically 24 h
after ril-10 removed culture medium, level mmcp-2
protein decline measurably day 5 culture. fact the
steady-state levels mmcp-2 mrna protein bmmc reversibly
altered culturing mast cells presence absence ril-10
suggests phenotype mast cells fixed. rather, a
dynamic state regulated cytokine network mast cells exposed
in different microenvironments.
