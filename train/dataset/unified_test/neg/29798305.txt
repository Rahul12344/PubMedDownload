objective:to summarize clinicopathological characteristics prognostic
factors squamous cell carcinoma (scc) base tongue (bot).
method:review clinical data 124 cases patients bot tumors. hpv-dna
was detected using spf10-dna enzyme immunoassay lipa genotyping method.
survival rates prognostic factors calculated spss 19.0 software
using kaplan-meier method multivariate cox model survival analysis.
result:5-year disease-specific survival (dss), 5-year overall survival median
survival time patients scc bot 54.5%, 48.5% 45.2 months,
respectively. hpv infection rate 18.3%(11/60), hpv-16 subtype 10
cases, accounting 90.9%(10/11). univariate analysis results showed that
smoking history (p=0.028), drinking history (p=0.001), tumor stage (p=0.009) 
p16 protein expression (p=0.015) significantly affected prognosis. the
prognosis patients hpv positive bot cancers better hpv
negative patients (5-year dss 80.8% compared 54.5%), statistical
difference (p=0.138). multivariate analysis revealed independent prognostic 
factors bot tumors drinking history (p=0.006) tumor stage (p=0.035). 
conclusion:the prognosis bot tumor relatively poor. smoking history,
drinking history, tumor staging expression p16 protein significantly
affected prognosis. drinking history tumor stage independent
prognostic factors bot cancers.
