this study aimed investigate transfection efficiency adenoviral
vector ad5/f35 hematopoietic malignant cells lines various origins and
ad5/f35 cytotoxicity. hematologic malignant cell lines various origins
were transfected ad5/f35-egfp different multiple infection (moi) and
ad5-egfp used control; proportion fluorescence positive cells was
detected flow cytometry; killing effect virus infective target cells
was assayed mtt observed fluorescence microscopy. results showed
that transfection efficiency ad5/f35 vector cell line myeloid origin
was > 99% moi = 30, transfective efficiency ad5 vector 26.4% moi
= 1,000; transfection efficiency ad5/f35 vector ad5 vector cell
line b cell origin 11.7% 5.7%, respectively, moi = 1,000. ad5/f35 
and ad5 vectors could effectively transfect cells cell origin, no
fluorescence positive cells detected moi = 1,000; significant killing 
effect ad5/f35 vector infective target cells observed moi = 1,000.
it concluded ad5/f35 vector infection definite selectivity to
hematologic malignant cells various origin, infection ability ad5/f35
vector cells myeloid origin stronger cells b cell
origin, cytotoxicity ad5/f35 vector infective target cells small.
the ad5/f35 vector preferable ad5 vector respect infection ability
and offers good prospects application gene therapy myeloid leukemia
cells target cells.
