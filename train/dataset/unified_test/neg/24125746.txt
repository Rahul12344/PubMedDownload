human vaccines three viruses use recombinant virus-like particles (vlps) 
as antigen: hepatitis b virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis e virus.
vlps excellent prophylactic vaccine antigens self-assembling
bionanoparticles (20 60 nm diameter) expose multiple epitopes their
surface faithfully mimic native virions. summarize long
journey vaccines bench patients. physical properties and
structural features recombinant vlp vaccine described. the
recent licensure hecolin hepatitis e virus adding third disease
indication prophylactic vlp-based vaccines, review crucial quality 
attributes vlp-based human vaccines three disease indications were
assessed, controlled, improved bioprocessing array of
structural functional analyses.
