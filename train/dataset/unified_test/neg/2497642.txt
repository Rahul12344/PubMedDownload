hepatitis b core antibody (anti-hbc) recently recognized a
paradoxical (surrogate) marker non-a, non-b hepatitis agents donated
blood. studied prospectively hepatitis b virus antigen antibody status
and liver functions 63 uremic patients admitted consecutively dialysis 
program. nineteen percent uremic patients, negative hepatitis b surface
antigen (hbsag), hepatitis b virus surface antibody (anti-hbs), hepatitis b virus
dna, antibody delta agents, anti-hbc sera time of
admission maintenance dialysis. prevalence significantly higher 
that medical personnel working dialysis unit (p = 0.043) and
healthy controls (p = 0.027). prevalence persistent presence isolated
anti-hbc increased 31% uremic patients long-term maintenance
dialysis. four patients developed anti-hbc alone course of
maintenance dialysis, appearance anti-hbc preceded blood
transfusion within 4 8 weeks. transient recurrent hepatic dysfunction
occurred three four patients. patients isolated anti-hbc were
characterized higher incidence repeated liver dysfunction (p less than
0.005), elevated alanine transaminase levels (p less 0.005), higher
transfusion requirement (p less 0.01). data strongly suggest 
patients isolated anti-hbc may acquired either hepatitis b virus
infection non-a, non-b hepatitis repeated blood transfusions despite
careful screening donated blood exclude transmission hepatitis b
virus.(abstract truncated 250 words)
