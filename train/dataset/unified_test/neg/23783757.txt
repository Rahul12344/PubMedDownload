torque teno sus virus (ttsuv) member recently created family
anelloviridae. two distinct species ttsuvs, 1 (ttsuv1) 2 (ttsuv2) have
been reported far domestic pigs wild boars. although ttsuvs not
been clearly linked specific disease pigs, relation ttsuv
infections postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (pmws) been
suggested. examine possibility, present study conducted
in search ttsuv1 ttsuv2 genomes tissues pmws non-pmws-affected 
animals. pmws diagnosis established clinical signs, characteristic
macroscopic histopathologic lesions presence porcine circovirus
type 2 dna. samples five different tissues (lungs, kidneys, livers, spleens,
and lymph nodes) pmws-affected non-pmws-affected pigs examined with
two specific pcr assays developed amplify ttsuv1 ttsuv2 genome segments.
ttsuv1 dna detected tissues non-diseased animals significantly
higher levels tissues pmws-affected pigs (p ≤ 0.001). regarding
ttsuv2, viral genomes detected nearly samples pmws-affected
(94.7 %) non-affected pigs (100 %), significant differences the
frequencies detection ttsuv2 genomes groups. significant
differences detected distribution ttsuv1 ttsuv2 the
different tissues examined (p = 0.970).
