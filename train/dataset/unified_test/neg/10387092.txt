in presence divalent metal cofactor (mg2+ mn2+), retroviral-encoded
integrase (in) catalyzes two distinct reactions: site-specific cleavage two
nucleotides 3' ends viral dna, sequence-independent joining of
the recessed viral ends staggered phosphates target dna. we
investigate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) in-dna interactions using
surface plasmon resonance. results show forms tight complexes both
with duplex oligonucleotides represent viral dna ends duplex
oligonucleotides unrelated sequence represent target dna
substrate. in-dna complexes stable 4.0 nacl, 50% (v/v) methanol, 
but resistant low concentrations sds, indicating their
stability highly dependent structural features protein. divalent
metal cofactors exert two distinct effects in-dna interaction. mn2+
inhibits binding model target dna apparent kd increasing
approximately 3-fold presence cation. hand, mn2+ (or 
mg2+) stimulates binding model viral dna end, decreasing the
apparent kd in-viral dna complex approximately 6-fold. such
metal-mediated stimulation binding viral dna totally
abolished substitution subterminal conserved ca/gt bp gt/ca bp, 
and greatly diminished viral dna end recessed "pre-processed." 
in binds viral duplex oligonucleotide whose end extended nonviral
sequences kinetics similar nonviral model target dna. suggests
that distinguish integrated dna product viral donor dna in
the presence divalent metal ion. thus, results show preferential
recognition viral dna hiv-1 achieved presence metal
cofactor, requires free, wild-type viral dna end.
