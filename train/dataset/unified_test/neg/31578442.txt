although modulation immune-related genes viral infection been
widely described vertebrates, potential implications non-coding rnas
(ncrnas), especially long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), immunity still a
nascent research field. model species zebrafish could serve useful
organism studying functionality lncrnas due numerous advantages
of teleost, including existence numerous mutant lines. work, 
we conducted whole-transcriptome analysis wild-type (wt) heterozygous
rag1 mutant (rag1+/-) zebrafish infection pathogen spring viraemia
of carp virus (svcv). wt rag1+/- zebrafish infected svcv 24 h. 
kidney samples sampled infected uninfected fish transcriptome
sequencing. total 198,540 contigs, 12,165 putative lncrnas were
identified zebrafish. putative lncrnas shared two
zebrafish lines. however, comparing lncrna profiles induced svcv
infection wt rag1+/- fish, lncrnas significantly
induced viral challenge exclusive line, reflecting highly
differential response virus. analysis neighboring genes lncrnas 
that exclusively modulated wt revealed high representation of
metabolism-related terms, whereas rag1+/- fish showed enrichment in
terms related adaptive immune response, among others. hand,
genes involved numerous antiviral processes surrounded commonly modulated
lncrnas, expected. results clearly indicate svcv infection in
zebrafish, expression array lncrnas functions different
aspects immunity induced.
