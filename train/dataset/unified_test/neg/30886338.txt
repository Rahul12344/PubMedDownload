according 2018 report united nations programme hiv/aids
(unaids), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), disease caused the
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), remains significant public health problem. 
the non-existence cure effective vaccine disease the
associated emergence resistant viral strains imply urgent need the
discovery novel anti-hiv drug candidates. current study aimed identify 
potential anti-retroviral compounds alchornea cordifolia. bioactive
compounds identified using several chromatographic spectroscopic
techniques subsequently evaluated cytotoxicity anti-hiv properties.
molecular modelling studies hiv-1 integrase (hiv-1 in) performed 
decipher mode action methylgallate, potent compound
(ic50 = 3.7 nm) analogues zinc database. cytotoxicity assays showed 
that neither isolated compounds crude methanolic extract displayed
cytotoxicity effects hela cell line. strong correlation in
vitro silico results observed important hiv-1 residues
interacting different compounds identified. current results
indicate methylgallate main anti-hiv-1 compound a. cordifolia stem
bark, could potential platform development new hiv-1 in
inhibitors.
