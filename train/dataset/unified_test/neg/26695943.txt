background: nuclear protein src-associated protein 68 kda mitosis
(sam68) known bind rna involved cellular processes triggered in
response environmental stresses, including virus infection. interestingly,
sam68 multi-functional protein implicated life cycle retroviruses 
and picornaviruses also considered marker virus-induced stress
granules (sgs). recently, demonstrated partial redistribution sam68 
the cytoplasm fmdv infected cells, interaction viral protease
3c(pro), found significant reduction viral titers consequence of
sam68-specific sirna knockdowns. despite that, details benefits fmdv
remains elucidated.
methods: sam68 cytoplasmic localization examined immunofluorescent
microscopy, counterstaining antibodies sam68, viral capsid protein
and markers sgs. relevance raaa motifs ires investigated
using electromobility shift assays sam68 protein parental mutant
fmdv rnas. addition, full genome wt mutant g-luc replicon rnas were
tested following transfection mammalian cells. impact sam68 depletion
to virus protein rna synthesis investigated cell-free system.
lastly, co-immunoprecipitation, structural modeling, subcellular
fractionation, viral protein interactions sam68 explored.
results: fmdv-induced cytoplasmic redistribution sam68 resulted it
temporarily co-localizing sg marker: tia-1. mutations disrupted fmdv
ires raaa motifs, putative affinity sam68 domain 3 4 cause a
reduction formation ribonucleoprotein complexes protein and
resulted non-viable progeny viruses replication-impaired replicons.
furthermore, depletion sam68 cell-free extracts greatly diminished fmdv rna
replication, restored addition recombinant sam68. results
here demonstrated sam68 specifically co-precipitates fmdv 3d(pol) 
and 3c(pro) consistent early observations fmdv 3c(pro)-induced cleavage
of sam68.
conclusion: found sam68 specific binding partner fmdv
non-structural proteins 3c(pro) 3d(pol) showed mutations raaa
motifs ires domains 3 4 cause decrease sam68 affinity rna
elements rendered mutant rna non-viable. interestingly, fmdv infected 
cells re-localized sam68 transiently detected along sg markers the
cytoplasm. results support importance sam68 host factor
co-opted fmdv infection demonstrate sam68 interact both, 
fmdv rna motifs ires viral non-structural proteins 3c(pro) and
3d(pol).
