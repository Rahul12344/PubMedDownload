although vaccines influenza widely available, control disease 
remains elusive. part, due inability current vaccines to
induce durable, broadly protective immune responses. prevention influenza
depends primarily effective antibody responses block virus entry.
following infection, high-affinity iga antibodies generated the
respiratory tract lead immune exclusion, igg prevents systemic
spread. effective long-lasting also exert immune pressure.
mutation antigenic determinants influenza therefore rapidly leads to
emergence novel variants evade previously generated protective responses.
not vaccines suffer strain-specific limitation, also they
are suboptimal ability induce durable immunity. however, recent
evidence demonstrated possibility inducing broadly cross-reactive
antibody responses. understanding ways high-titer,
long-lived antibody responses directed cross-reactive epitopes can
be induced would lead development novel vaccines may remove the
requirement recurrent vaccination.
