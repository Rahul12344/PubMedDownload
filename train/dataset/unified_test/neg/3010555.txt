identification human cytomegalovirus virus dna segment complements an
adenovirus 5 immediate early mutant.

spector dj, tevethia mj.

human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) complements adenovirus mutant dl312, is
completely defective expression adenovirus immediate early e1a gene
region, lytic growth (tevethia spector, 1984). assay defines at
least one hcmv function, activation transcription adenovirus early
genes trans, must provided dl312 replication coinfected cells. 
we show trans-activation depended expression one hcmv
gene. human embryonic lung cells transfected dl312 dna-protein complex 
and either hcmv dna recombinant plasmids containing adenovirus e1a gene
region hcmv (towne strain) dna fragments. replication dl312 occurred only
in cells received dpc either e1a gene, hcmv dna, xbai-e 
hcmv dna fragment (0.68 0.77 map units). addition, show hcmv also
complemented adenovirus mutant pm975 growth 0.2% serum. since pm975 grows 
poorly low concentrations serum due defect e1a gene product,
this assay identified second hcmv e1a-like function.
