objective: prevention diagnosis transfusion-associated hcmv infection 
has address different questions: blood donor potentially infections? is
the transfused recipient undergoing active primary secondary infection?
data sources: international literature (current contents life sciences) and
reports study-group.
selection criteria: original articles english german.
results: monocytes identified major site latency human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv) peripheral blood. high seropositivity rates are
observed polytransfused individuals, intravenous drug users, organ transplant 
recipients, maintenance hemodialysis patients, homo/bisexuals prostitutes.
although, important developments order improve the
sensitivity elisas diagnosis active hcmv infection, serologic
testing often fails detect igm iga antibodies immunocompromised
patients. rapid virus isolation, structural antigen detection dna
amplification pcr peripheral blood monocytes considerably improved
diagnosis acute hcmv infection neonates, organ transplant recipients and
aids patients. due low correlation hcmv dna detection hcmv disease,
pcr testing actually recommended monitoring high risk patients 
and screening infectiosity blood components.
conclusions: consequence numerous improvements serological, virological
and molecular methods, efficient prevention diagnosis of
transfusion-associated hcmv infection become possible.
