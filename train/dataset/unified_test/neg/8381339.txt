dengue type 2 virus (dv)-induced suppressor cytokine (sf) binds macrophages to
transmit suppressor signal recruit second subpopulation suppressor 
t cells. present study undertaken identify purify receptor for
sf (sf-r) macrophages. binding 125i-sf macrophages saturable and
reversible. scatchard analysis showed presence high (54,000/cell) and
low (1.78 x 10(6)/cell) affinity receptor sites. binding 125i-sf to
macrophages inhibited pretreatment macrophages anti-sf antiserum
but heterologous antiserum. normal mouse peritoneal macrophage membrane 
was solubilized triton-x-100 components separated low pressure
liquid chromatography (lplc) purify sf-r. presence sf binding moiety
(sf-r) screened step purification. purified sf-r resolved into
two bands 45-50 kd mol. wt sds-page. 125i-sf+sf-r complex run sds-page
showed single band 55-60 kd mol. wt autoradiography. anti-sf-r
antiserum reacted sf-r western blot test; reaction abolished by
pretreatment blots proteinase k, pretreatment with
periodic acid. sf-r composed two polypeptide chains (alpha beta) which
were obtained pure form high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) of
dithiothreitol- iodoacetamide-treated sf-r. beta chain bound sf.
