plum pox virus (ppv) sweet (swc) sour (soc) cherry isolates first
ppv isolates recovered natural infection sweet sour cherry
plants, respectively. complete nucleotide sequences determined
finding deduced genome organisation typical ppv species. genomes are
9795 nucleotides long, excluding 3' terminal poly(a) tail, contain an
open reading frame 9432 nt, encoding polyprotein 3143 amino acids. the
nucleotide predicted amino acid sequences ppv-swc soc been
pairwise compared available sequences different ppv strains. although a
very high similarity exists whole genomes polyproteins two
cherry isolates, high levels divergence calculated sequences of
ppv-m, ea isolates. particular, considerable divergence has
been found part 5' non coding region, regions encoding p1, p3 + 6k1, 6k2
and nia-vpg proteins well n-terminal domain coat protein.
phylogenetic analysis undertaken order establish taxonomic
localisation swc soc isolates within ppv species, showing are
always clustered together separated rest ppv strains, being
clearly distant.
