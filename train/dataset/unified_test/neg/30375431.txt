the present study illustrates genetic diversity four uncultured viral
communities surface waters cochin estuary (ce), india. viral
diversity inferred using illumina hiseq paired-end sequencing using a
linker-amplified shotgun library (lasl) revealed different double-stranded dna
(dsdna) viral communities. water samples collected four stations
pr1, pr2, pr3, pr4, pre-monsoon (prm) season. analysis virus
families indicated myoviridae common viral community the
ce followed siphoviridae podoviridae. significant (p < 0.05)
spatial variations relative abundance dominant families response 
the salinity regimes. relative abundance myoviridae podoviridae were
high euryhaline region siphoviridae mesohaline region the
estuary. predominant phage type ce phages infected synechococcus.
the viral proteins found involved major functional activities 
as atp binding, dna binding, dna replication. study highlights the
genetic diversity dsdna viral communities functional protein
predictions highly productive estuarine system. further, metavirome
data generated study enhance repertoire publicly available
dataset advance understanding estuarine viral ecology.
