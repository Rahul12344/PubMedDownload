in work, evaluate stability, dynamics protein-nucleic acid
interaction flock house virus (fhv). fhv rna insect virus,
non-enveloped, member family nodaviridae. composed bipartite
single-stranded rna genome packaged icosahedral capsid 180 copies 
identical protein (alpha protein). fundamental property many animal viruses 
is post-assembly maturation required infectivity. fhv constructed a
provirion, matures infectious virion cleavage alpha protein
into beta gamma subunits. used high pressure, temperature chemical
denaturing agents promote perturbation viral capsid. effects were
monitored spectroscopy measurements (fluorescence, light scattering cd)
and size-exclusion chromatography. data showed fhv stable to
pressures 310 mpa room temperature. fluorescence emission light 
scattering values showed small changes reversible decompression. 
when combined pressure sub-denaturing urea concentrations (1 m), the
changes drastic, suggesting dissociation capsid. however, 
changes reversible pressure release. complete dissociation fhv 
could observed high urea concentrations (10 m). no
significant changes emission spectra 5 urea. fhv also stable 
we used temperature treatments (high low). also compared effects of
urea pressure fhv wild type cleavage-defective mutant vlps (virus-like
particles). vlps authentic particles distinguishable protein-rna
interactions, since vlps pack cellular rna native particles contain viral
rna. results demonstrated native particles stable vlps 
physical chemical treatments. data point specificity the
interaction capsid protein viral rna. specificity is
crucial stability particle, makes interaction an
excellent target drug development.
