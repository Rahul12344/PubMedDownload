cd8(+) lymphocytes important mediators adaptive immunity certain
viral, protozoan bacterial pathogens. activated cd8(+) cells able to
induce cytolysis infected cells (perforin cd95-cd95l mediated pathways)
and also elaborate cytokines, including ifn-gamma tnf appropriate mhc
class i-peptide recognition. new technologies detection of
antigen-specific cd8(+) cells, including tetrameric mhc class i-peptide
complexes, intracellular ifn-gamma staining ifn-gamma elispot analysis have
revised understanding magnitude cd8(+) cell response to
infection. here, using intracellular cytokine staining, compare detection of
ifn-gamma tnf analysis pathogen-specific cd8(+) cell lines and
cd8(+) cells primary viral infection (lcmv) secondary bacterial
infection (listeria monocytogenes). multiple conditions multiple
epitopes, find staining intracellular ifn-gamma consistently detects 
a higher frequency antigen-specific cd8(+) cells detection of
intracellular tnf. however, (a) intracellular staining tnf used to
detect antigen-specific cd8(+) cell responses (b) intracellular staining
for cytokines useful approach vitro characterization of
antigen-specific cd8(+) cell lines.
