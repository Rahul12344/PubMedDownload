mannan-binding protein animal serum lectin (i.e. molecule the
ability bind specifically certain carbohydrate structures). relevant
carbohydrate ligands found many pathogenic microorganisms. binding
to suitable carbohydrate ligands, mannan-binding protein found an
activator classical pathway complement via activation the
c1r2c1s2 complex, i.e. antibody c1q independent. molecular organization
of mbp resembles c1q distinct division collagen-like and
globular amino acid sequences. molecular similarity seems basis
for common functional activity two proteins. mbp may play important
protective role, especially early stages infection prior generation 
of specific humoral cellular defence system. paper explores the
structure physiological functions mannan-binding protein.
