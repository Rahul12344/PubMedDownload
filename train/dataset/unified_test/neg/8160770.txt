persistent human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infections responsible for
significant morbidity mortality immunocompromised individuals. one
mechanism hcmv may develop persistence primary infection is
through inhibition host cell human leukocyte antigen (hla) class ii expression
with resultant escape normal antiviral immune surveillance.
immunofluorescence flow cytometry human endothelial cell (ec) cultures
infected hcmv ad169 ec propagated strain, vhl/e, showed marked
reduction interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma)-induced surface expression hla-dr.
this inhibition occur ec treated ultraviolet-inactivated
virus ifn-gamma. hcmv, determined dual-labeling immunohistochemistry,
inhibited induction surface cytoplasmic class ii antigens specifically 
infected cells. hcmv infection also inhibited ifn-gamma tumor necrosis
factor-alpha up-regulation hla class expression. northern blot analysis of
infected, ifn-gamma-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells revealed an
absence class ii mrna. persistence hcmv may result part ability
to inhibit hla class ii induction infected cells.
