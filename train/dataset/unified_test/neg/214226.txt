augmented immunogenicity tumor cell membranes produced infection with
influenza virus compared moloney sarcoma virus.

takeichi n, austin fc, oikawa t, boone cw.

the tumor-associated transplantation antigens (tata) crude membrane extracts
from sv40-transformed balb/3t3 tumor cells lytically infected influenza
virus markedly immunogenic extracts uninfected cells
measured either ability induce heightened resistance tumorgraft
challenge heightened lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity tumor cells
in vitro. intact tumor cells (as opposed membrane extracts) were
productively infected moloney sarcoma virus, made immunogenic
that would grow x-irradiated syngeneic animals. yet crude membrane
extracts moloney sarcoma virus-infected tumor cells showed increase
in tata activity analogous seen infection influenza virus.
thus, influenza virus augmentation tumor membrane tata may operate a
different mechanism oncornavirus augmentation intact tumor cell 
tata reported others. appears moloney sarcoma virus possibly other
oncornaviruses cannot used augment tata activity tumor cell
membranes way surface-budding viruses can.
