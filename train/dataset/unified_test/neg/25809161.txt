influenza viruses account significant morbidity worldwide. inflammatory
responses, including excessive generation reactive oxygen nitrogen species
(rons), mediate lung injury severe influenza infections. however, the
molecular basis inflammation-induced lung damage fully understood.
here, studied influenza h1n1 infected cells vitro, well h1n1 infected
mice, monitored molecular cellular responses course 2
weeks vivo. show influenza induces dna damage both, cells 
directly exposed virus vitro (measured using comet assay) also when
cells exposed virus vivo (estimated via γh2ax foci). show dna
damage, well responses dna damage persist vivo long virus
has cleared, times inflammation associated rons (measured 
by xanthine oxidase activity oxidative products). frequency lung
epithelial immune cells increased γh2ax foci elevated vivo,
especially dividing cells (ki-67-positive) exposed oxidative stress during
tissue regeneration. additionally, observed significant increase in
apoptotic cells well increased levels dna double strand break (dsb)
repair proteins ku70, ku86 rad51 regenerative phase. in
conclusion, results show influenza induces dna damage vitro in
vivo, dna damage responses activated, raising possibility that
dna repair capacity may determining factor tissue recovery disease
outcome.
