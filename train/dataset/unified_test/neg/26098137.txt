background: spite profound reduction incidence, cervical cancer claims
>275,000 lives annually. previously demonstrated efficacy safety of
radioimmunotherapy directed hpv16 e6 oncoprotein experimental cervical
cancer.
materials & methods: undertook direct comparison targeting e7 e6
oncoproteins specific (188)rhenium-labeled monoclonal antibodies caski
subcutaneous xenografts cervical cancer cells mice.
results: significant tumor inhibition seen in
radioimmunotherapy-treated mice, followed unlabeled monoclonal antibodies 
to e6 e7. hematological toxicity observed. immunohistochemistry
suggests effect unlabeled antibodies c3 complement mediated.
conclusion: demonstrated first time radioimmunotherapy
directed toward e7 oncoprotein inhibits experimental tumors growth, decreases e7 
expression may offer novel approach cervical cancer therapy.
