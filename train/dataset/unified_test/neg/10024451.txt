solid-state nmr spectroscopy used analyze conformational heterogeneity
of major coat protein (pviii) filamentous bacteriophage fd. one and
two-dimensional solid-state nmr spectra magnetically aligned samples fd
bacteriophage reveal increase temperature single site
substitution (tyr21 met, y21m) reduce conformational heterogeneity
observed throughout wild-type pviii. nmr results consistent previous
studies indicating conformational flexibility hinge-bend segment that
links amphipathic hydrophobic helices membrane-bound form the
protein plays essential role phage assembly, involves major
