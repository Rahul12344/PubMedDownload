interleukin 11 class-1 helical cytokine, four-helix bundle
structure, possessing pleiotropic characteristics involved physiological
processes including blood production, bone formation placentation. the
interleukin 11 paralogues (il11a il11b) identified fish with
only il11a carp trout characterized analyzed its
expression thus far. here, cloned studied structure expression 
il11b japanese flounder (paralichthys olivaceus), compared the
existing information fish il11 paralogues. japanese flounder il11b (poil11b)
cdna composed 1536 bp encoding 201 aa residues 23 aa leader
peptide, three cysteine residues (c12, c183 c198) four potential n-linked
glycosylation sites. poil11b show constitutive expression tissues 
adult fish except slight expression kidney spleen, the
very high expression peripheral blood leukocytes (pbls). poil11b is
transiently up-regulated bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) increasingly
stimulated ifn inducer poly i:c kidney, spleen peripheral blood
leukocytes adult fish vitro. likewise slightly stimulated by
edwardsiella tarda infection highly expressed hirame rhabdovirus
(hirrv) infection kidney juvenile fish. stimulation studies suggest
that poil11b, aside role bacterial infection, well involved in
antiviral responses. moreover, poil11b structure expression pattern appears
to slightly distinct opposite il11a, respectively, suggesting a
complementation function duplicate fish il11 genes.
