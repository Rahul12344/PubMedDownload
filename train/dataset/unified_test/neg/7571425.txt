according phylogenetic data, 100 years ago avian influenza virus
passed species barrier (possibly first) pigs (possibly there) 
humans. 1979 avian influenza virus (as whole, without reassortment)
again entered pig population northern europe, forming stable lineage.
here shown early north european swine viruses exhibit higher 
normal evolutionary rates highly variable respect plaque
morphology neutralizability monoclonal antibodies. results are
consistent idea that, order pass species barrier, influenza
a virus needs mutator mutation provide additional number variants,
from new host might select best fitting ones. mutator mutation
could advantage stress conditions might enable virus to
pass species barrier whole even twice, seems happened
about 100 years ago. stressful situation recent swine
lineage, since viruses seem adapted already new host the
most recent isolates--at least northern germany--are genetically stable and
seem lost putative mutator mutation again.
