viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv) causes one world's most
important finfish diseases, killing >80 species across eurasia north america.
a new especially virulent strain (ivb) emerged north american great
lakes 2003, threatening fisheries, baitfish, aquaculture industries.
weeks-long costly cell culture oie usda-aphis approved diagnostic.
a new standardized reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (start-pcr)
assay uniquely incorporates internal standards improve accuracy and
prevent false negatives developed evaluated ability detect and
quantify vhsv. results start-pcr, sybr(®) green real time qrt-pcr, cell 
culture compared, well effects potential pcr inhibitors (edta
and high rna). findings show start-pcr sensitive, detecting single
molecule, 100% accuracy six molecules, false negatives. in
comparison, false negatives ranged 14 47% sybr(®) green real time
qrt-pcr tests, 47-70% cell culture. start-pcr uniquely controlled for
edta rna interference. range vhsv quantitation start-pcr was
1.0×10(0)-1.2×10(5) vhsv/10(6)actb1 molecules wild caught fishes and
1.0×10(0)-8.4×10(5) molecules laboratory challenged specimens. latter
experiments, muskellunge skin lesions significantly viral molecules
(mean=1.9×10(4)) without (1.1×10(3)) (p<0.04). vhsv infection was
detected earlier injection immersion challenged yellow perch (two
versus three days), molecule numbers comparable relatively
consistent remaining course experiment. results show the
start-pcr test accurately reliably detects quantifies vhsv.
