specific chromosomal translocations involved 80% human b cell

consequence reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving loci human
immunoglobulin chains either well-described cellular protooncogenes or
putative protooncogenes. juxtaposition protooncogenes the
immunoglobulin loci results transcriptional deregulation, of
their proximity genetic elements within human immunoglobulin loci capable 
of activating gene transcription cis considerable chromosomal distances. 
sequence analysis translocation breakpoints provided important
insights concerning molecular mechanisms involved chromosome translocation
in b cells. appears reciprocal translocations contributing b cell 
neoplasia catalyzed enzymes involved physiological
immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. analysis human b cell leukemias and
lymphomas also provided considerable information concerning possible
scenarios b cell neoplastic transformation. clear epstein-barr
virus play direct role neoplastic transformation, may
contribute increasing number b cells risk developing chromosome
translocations immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. cytogenetic and
molecular genetic analysis cell malignancies beginning provide 
similar scenario neoplastic transformation. locus alpha-chain
