hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (hps) acute disease resulting infection 
with one number new world hantaviruses. hps mortality rate of
40% and, unlike many severe respiratory diseases, often occurs young,
healthy adults. infection usually initiated inhalation rodent excreta
containing virus particles, human-to-human transmission documented. 
postmortem tissue samples show high levels viral antigen within the
respiratory endothelium, clear virus traverse the
respiratory epithelium order initiate infection microvasculature. we
have utilized andes virus infection primary, differentiated airway epithelial 
cells investigate ability virus interact cross the
respiratory epithelium. andes virus infects clara goblet cell populations
but ciliated cells, infection pattern corresponds the
expression beta(3) integrin, viral receptor. virus infect via 
apical basolateral membrane, progeny virus particles secreted
bidirectionally. obvious cytopathology associated infection, and
beta(3) integrins appear critical respiratory epithelial cell
monolayer integrity. data suggest hantavirus infection the
respiratory epithelium may play important role early prodrome phase 
of disease well serving source virus involved transmission.
