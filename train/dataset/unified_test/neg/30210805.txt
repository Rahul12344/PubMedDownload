virus-infected cells regulate non-permissive bystander cells, precise
mechanisms remain incompletely understood. report process can
be mediated transfer viral rna-loaded exosomes shed infected cells 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs), turn regulate the
differentiation function cells viral infection. specifically, 
demonstrated patients chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection
exhibited significant increases follicular regulatory (tfr) cells and
decreases follicular helper (tfh) cells. mdsc-mediated t-cell
dysregulations resulted increased ratio tfr/tfh il-10 production 
peripheral blood. specifically, co-culture mdscs derived hcv patients
with healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) induced expansion tfr,
whereas depletion mdscs pbmcs hcv patients reduced increases in
tfr frequency il-10 production, promoted differentiation of
ifn-Î³-producing tfh cells. importantly, found exosomes isolated 
plasma hcv patients supernatant hcv-infected hepatocytes could drive
monocytic myeloid cell differentiation mdscs. exosomes enriched
in tetraspanins, cd63 cd81, contained hcv rna, exosomes
isolated patients antiviral treatment contained hcv rna could
not induce mdsc differentiation. notably, hcv rna-containing exosomes
(hcv-exo) sufficient induce mdscs. furthermore, incubation healthy
myeloid cells hcv-exo inhibited expression mir-124, whereas
reconstitution pbmcs mir-124 abolished effects hcv-exo mdsc
induction. taken together, results indicate hcv-associated exosomes
can transfer immunomodulatory viral rna infected cells neighboring immune
cells trigger mdsc expansion, subsequently promotes tfr differentiation
and inhibits tfh function. study reveals previously unrecognized path that
represents novel mechanism immune dysregulation chronic viral
infection.
