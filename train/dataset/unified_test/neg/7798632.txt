in cross-sectional study, titers antibodies e4 e7 proteins of
human papillomavirus (hpv) type 16 measured peptide-based enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay 1707 sera. sera obtained healthy individuals
(ages 1 95 years), patients hpv-associated infection (cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia cervical cancer), patients at
high risk hpv infection (attending sexually transmitted disease clinic or
referred colposcopist abnormal papanicolaou smear). the
prevalence anti-e7 antibodies increased age, although overall
prevalence adult population low (10.36%) compared frequent
detection hpv 16 dna population. suggests fraction 
patients infected hpv 16 develop anti-e7 response. age distribution
of anti-e4 antibodies showed different pattern, i.e., prevalence low in
the adult population (1.14%) exceeded 20% children teenagers. the
specificity anti-e4 reaction supported highly significant
association anti-e6 positivity children's sera (p = 0.002), was
assumed infection hpv 16 occur frequently early life. as
compared healthy controls, patients high risk hpv infection a
significantly higher frequency (p < 0.001) antibodies hpv 16 e4 protein
(but e6 e7 protein) sera. therefore, conclude 
in adults e4-specific antibodies may marker virus replication.
