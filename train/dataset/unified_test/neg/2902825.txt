human t-lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i)--associated myelopathy (ham) 
shown closely related htlv-i infection. however, mechanism 
this disease occurs infection htlv-i still obscure. found that
ham patients unusually high proportions cd4+ hla-dr+ cells, cd8+hla-dr+
cells, okt9+ cells, cd38(okt10)+ cells peripheral blood, of
which suggest presence activated t-lymphocytes. antibody titer against
htlv-i much higher ham patients htlv-i carriers without evident
neurological disease (p less 0.01). polyclonal gammopathy also observed 
in ham patients, 6 10 patients positive rheumatoid factor.
these observations, coupled previous observation corticosteroid
therapy improves clinical symptoms patients, make likely that
continuous activation immune system, initiated htlv-i infection, plays 
a key role pathogenesis ham.
