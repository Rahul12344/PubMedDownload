cantaloupe (cucumis melo var. reliculatus) wax gourd (benincasa hispida
cogn.) plants showing yellow leaf disease observed central
thailand since 1993. disease transmitted cantaloupe wax gourd
plants grafting whiteflies (bemisia tabaci genn.) (k. kittipakorn,
unpublished data). leaf yellowing symptoms transmission by
whiteflies, geminivirus suspected. three naturally infected cantaloupe 
four naturally infected wax gourd plants showing leaf yellowing collected
from fields kamphaengsaen, nakorn pathom, thailand. virus cultures were
maintained cantaloupe wax gourd plants. inoculations done a
whitefly vector. symptoms cantaloupe wax gourd plants as
those observed field. virus dna associated yellow leaf disease of
cantaloupe wax gourd plants amplified polymerase chain reaction with
geminivirus-specific degenerate primers, described rojas et al. (2), that
anneal within ac1 open reading frame (orf; replication associated protein
gene) av1 orf (coat protein gene) bipartite geminiviruses c1
and v2 orfs monopartite geminiviruses (2). fragments (1.2 kbp) amplified 
and cloned affected cantaloupe wax gourd plants. three independent
clones sequenced analyzed, identical 32-base stem loop regions 
found amplified fragments isolates, including conserved
nonanucleotide sequence taatattac, present geminiviruses. the
iterative sequence ggcgtc also found intergenic region (ir) (434 bp)
of amplified fragments isolates. b component could be
detected. nucleotide sequences ir v1 compared 28
well-studied whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses revealed â‰ˆ96% sequence
identity dna tomato leaf curl virus genus geminivirus india
(tolcv-in 2) (1) isolates. iterative sequence ggcgtc ir also 
was identical sequence tolcv-in 2. results establish the
provisional identity pathogen causing yellow leaf disease cantaloupe
and wax gourds thailand tolcv closely related strains. references: (1)
