in whole cells, effects several androgens antiandrogens 
induction dna binding human wild-type androgen receptor (ar) a
mutant receptor arl (lncap mutation; codon 868, thr ala) examined and
related transcription activation ability receptors. study dna 
binding, ar expression vector cotransfected chinese hamster ovary cells
with promoter interference plasmid cytomegalovirus-(androgen-responsive
element)3-luciferase, containing one androgen-responsive elements between
the tata box cytomegalovirus promoter start site luciferase
gene transcription. expression levels ar up-regulated some
agonists, receptor expression levels comparable antiandrogens
studied. presence androgens, wild-type ar able reduce
promoter activity cytomegalovirus-(androgen-responsive
element)3-luciferase plasmid, indicating androgen-dependent dna binding the
ar. full antagonists hydroxyflutamide, ici 176.334, ru 23908 block ar
binding dna. antagonists cyproterone acetate ru 38486 induce
approximately 50% dna binding found androgens. transcription
activation assay, ru 38646-bound receptor almost inactive, the
receptor complexed cyproterone acetate showed partial agonistic activity.
interaction antagonists cyproterone acetate, hydroxyflutamide, ru
23908 mutant receptor arl resulted dna-bound a
transcriptionally active receptor. conclusion, transformation ar a
dna-binding state whole cells blocked several antiandrogens.
furthermore, studies antiandrogens cyproterone acetate ru 38486 show
that dna binding alone sufficient accomplish full transcriptional
activity. full activity requires additional changes, presumably protein
structure receptor.
