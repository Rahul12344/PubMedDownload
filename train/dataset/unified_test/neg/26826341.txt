long noncoding (lnc)rnas comprise diverse group transcripts including large 
intervening noncoding (linc)rnas, natural antisense transcripts (nats) and
intronic lncrnas. functions mechanisms 200 lncrnas been
studied vitro results suggest lncrnas may molecular markers of
prognosis cancer patients. lncrnas promote virus replication and
allow escape cytosolic surveillance suppress antiviral immunity. for
example, lncrna cause persistent infection theiler's virus, microrna
(mir)-27a/b important efficient murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) replication.
the available evidence suggests lncrnas may potential targets novel
antiviral drugs.
