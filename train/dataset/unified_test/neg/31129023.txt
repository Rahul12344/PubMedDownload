background: achieving hepatitis c elimination requires novel approaches engage
people highest risk infection care pathways. point-of-care-tests may
help overcome barriers preventing people inject drugs (pwid)
accessing testing progressing treatment hepatitis c virus (hcv). we
assessed feasibility acceptability hcv point-of-care testing needle
and syringe exchange programs (nsps) co-located three community health clinics
in melbourne, australia.
methods: nsp clients offered oral fluid point-of-care test hcv
antibody nsp staff. positive hcv antibody tests followed a
point-of-care test hcv rna alongside standard-of-care laboratory testing 
hepatitis c treatment work-up. participants offered same-day point-of-care
results site, via phone text message, upon return service.
participants scheduled follow-up review study nurse for
assessment linkage treatment.
results: total 174 participants completed hcv antibody point-of-care test;
150 (86%) reactive result. these, 140 (93%) underwent hcv rna
point-of-care test 76 (54%) tested positive; participants (5%) waited 
site results delivery, majority rna positive (63%) attended a
follow-up visit treatment work-up (median time follow-up visit = 11 days; 
iqr = 7-20 days). majority participants reported preference for
point-of-care tests (66%) supported nsp staff involvement testing (90%).
conclusion: provision hcv point-of-care tests, follow-up linkage to
treatment services nsps feasible acceptable pwid. despite 
participants waiting receive same-day results, effective linkage 
care, suggesting value evaluation approach.
