neoplastic transformation one-day-old hamster brain cells produced by
infection sv-40 virus verified phase contrast microscopy, growth in
semisolid media, intracranial tumor production inoculation cells
into one-day-old hamsters. transformed cells studied transmission
and scanning electron microscopy. numerous alterations cell surface
structure nuclear cytoplasmic organization suggest marked increase
in cell metabolism rate mitosis cell division. cilia a
nine-to-zero pattern microtubule doublets present cells with
intermediate size filaments stained glial fibrillary acidic protein.
the findings indicate infection one-day-old hamster brain cells in
culture sv-40 virus results transformation neoplastic state 
the transformed cells differentiating neoplastic astrocytes.
