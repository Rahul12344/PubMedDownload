purpose: review high-resolution computed tomography (ct) findings in
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hct) recipients proven human
metapneumovirus (hmpv) pneumonia.
materials methods: study included 5 hct recipients proven hmpv
pneumonia. patients included 4 men 1 woman ranging age 23 58
years (mean age = 42 years). ct scans assessed presence,
appearance, size, distribution parenchymal abnormalities.
results: human metapneumovirus isolated 5 patients series.
none patients infectious organism identified cultures
or bronchoalveolar lavage. predominant ct findings bilateral
abnormalities patients, consisting primarily mixture patterns,
including, commonly, ground-glass attenuation nodular opacities. areas
of ground-glass opacification zonal predominance bilateral,
asymmetric, patchily distributed. multiple nodules identified 4 (80%)
of 5 patients. nodules multiple; less 5 nodules identified 1
case, 5 10 nodules identified 3 cases. nodules cases
were less 10 mm diameter. areas air-space consolidation were
identified 2 (40%) patients. patients available follow-up;
lesions improved 4 patients.
conclusion: thin-section ct manifestations hmpv pneumonia usually consist 
of mixture patterns, including, commonly, ground-glass attenuation 
nodular opacities.
