primary hepatocyte cultures duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) infected ducklings
were used evaluate antiviral activity purine pyrimidine
2',3'-dideoxynucleosides. purine 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides effective
inhibitors hepadnavirus replication, whereas pyrimidine dideoxynucleosides
were not. 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine 2,6-diaminopurine 2',3'-dideoxyriboside
(dddapr) effective antiviral agents studied. dddapr given
intramuscularly twice daily 10 mg/kg rapidly cleared dhbv-dna sera of
persistently infected ducklings effect permanent.
