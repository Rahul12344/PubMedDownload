newcastle disease (nd) highly contagious disease affects many species
of birds causes significant economic losses poultry industry
worldwide. fifteen newcastle disease virus (ndv) isolates obtained rural
chickens northwest ethiopia 2011 2012 characterized genotypically.
the main functional region f gene amplified sequenced (260
nucleotides). among ethiopian ndv isolates, 2 isolates virulent motif
(112)r-r-q-k-r-f(117) cleavage site fusion protein 13
isolates contained lentogenic motif (112)g-g/r-q-g-r-l(117). phylogenetic
analysis based variable region f gene indicated two
isolates exhibiting virulent motif belonged lineage 5 (genotype vii)
subgenotype remaining 13 isolates grouped lineage 2 (genotype
ii). nucleotide sequences lineage 5 isolates genetically related to
the sudanese ndv isolates, suggesting potential epidemiological link nd
outbreaks neighbouring countries. lentogenic strains shared
similarities la sota vaccine strain probably originated vaccine
strain either direct exposure birds live vaccine to
infectious la sota-like strains circulating rural poultry. study provides
genetic evidence existence different ndv genotypes circulating the
rural poultry ethiopia. virulent ndv continues problem poultry 
sector ethiopia, continuous circulation rural commercial
poultry calls improved surveillance intensified vaccination other
control measures.
