porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) condensed
single-stranded positive-sense rna genome contains several overlapping
regions. transcription regulatory sequence (trs) important cis-acting 
element participating prrsv discontinuous transcription process. based on
reverse genetic system type 2 highly pathogenic prrsv cell-passage attenuated 
strain phun4-f112, firefly luciferase renilla luciferase genes inserted
between orf1b orf2. extra trs6 embedded behind foreign luciferase 
genes. pa-fluc pa-rluc constructed successfully rescued marc-145 
cells. phenotypical characteristics progeny virus were
indistinguishable vhun4-f112 genetically stable at
least 25 cell passages. mutant virus-infected cells lysed different time 
points assess luciferase activities measure foreign gene expression
levels. results showed identical variations luciferase activities of
the recombinants marc-145 cells, indicating suitable for
monitoring viral propagation prrsv-permissive cell cultures. also
used infect pulmonary alveolar macrophages, yielded similar variations
in luciferase activities. therefore, va-fluc va-rluc present powerful new
tools monitor prrsv propagation passaged target cells.
