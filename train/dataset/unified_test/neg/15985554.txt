characterization cellular receptors human, simian, feline
immunodeficiency viruses tropic lymphocytes macrophages have
revealed common theme sequential binding viral envelope proteins with
two coreceptors mediate virus infection target cells. contrast 
dual tropic immunodeficiency viruses, ungulate lentiviruses, including equine
infectious anemia virus (eiav), exclusively infect cells the
monocyte-macrophage lineage cause progressive degenerative diseases without
clinical immunodeficiency. eiav causes uniquely dynamic disease is
characterized recurrent disease episodes including fever, diarrhea, lethargy, 
anemia, thrombocytopenia. although eiav provides important animal model
for lentivirus disease resulting macrophage infection, date has
been definition specific cellular receptor(s) used equine
lentivirus infect target cells. current study, identified and
cloned functional receptor eiav, designated equine lentivirus receptor-1
(elr1), related family tnf receptor (tnfr) proteins. elr1 shown 
be expressed various equine cells permissive eiav replication vitro,
including monocytes macrophages. contrast, eiav-resistant human, murine,
and simian cells negative elr1 expression became susceptible to
virus infection transduced recombinant murine retrovirus expressing
the elr1. thus, results identify specific functional receptor a
macrophagetropic lentivirus indicate infection eiav may mediated
by single receptor, contrast coreceptors used lymphotropic
immunodeficiency lentiviruses.
