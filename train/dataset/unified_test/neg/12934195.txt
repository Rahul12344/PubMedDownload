mannose-binding lectin (mbl) mediates protection infections using 
complement system, certain microorganisms may increase infectivity by
exploiting host defense system. thus, speculated whether
genetically determined low mbl levels may confer partial protection against
certain intracellular microorganisms, mycobacterium tuberculosis. we
investigated mbl alleles 109 culture-positive human immunodeficiency
virus-uninfected patients tuberculosis living denmark 250 white
control subjects. patients control subjects divided 3 different
groups defined undetectable, low, high serum mbl concentrations, which
correlates deficient, low, high expressing mbl genotypes. significantly 
decreased frequency patients low-expressing mbl genotype observed
in white patients compared control subjects. tendency also was
observed patients ethnic origin. may hypothesized that
heterozygosity mbl variant alleles, encodes low serum mbl levels, is
associated protection clinical tuberculosis.
