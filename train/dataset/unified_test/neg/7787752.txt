a virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (vahs) non-neoplastic,
generalized histiocytic proliferation prominent hemophagocytosis associated 
with systemic viral infection. epstein-barr virus (ebv) one candidate for
this association serologic molecular biologic studies lacking
in many cases. although vahs generally benign process, ebv-associated
hemophagocytic syndrome (ebv-ahs) often fatal relatively high
mortality rate. therefore, ebv-ahs must distinguished vahs caused by
other viruses. recent evidence indicates pathophysiology ebv-ahs
appears mediated unrestricted release cytokines produced the
ebv-infected cells. clinical laboratory findings, differential
diagnosis, virology studies, pathophysiology, treatment ebv-ahs are
reviewed.
