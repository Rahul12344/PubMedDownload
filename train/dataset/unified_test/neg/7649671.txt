we prospectively studied, 24-h holter monitoring, 21 consecutive human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected patients, stages infection,
in order assess dysrhythmic profile. three (14.3%) patients presented
one isolated run supraventricular tachycardia, < 10 beats, was
considered clinically irrelevant. patient presented clinically relevant 
supraventricular ventricular tachy bradydysrhythmias. one (4.8%) patient
presented intermittent mobitz type second-degree av block, two (9.5%) patients 
paroxistic 2:1 av block one (4.8%) patient presented bifascicular block 
the 12-lead ecg persisted ambulatory recording. study
suggests clinically relevant cardiac tachydysrhythmias rare our
population hiv infected patients. hand found unexpectedly
high incidence cardiac impulse conduction disturbances.
