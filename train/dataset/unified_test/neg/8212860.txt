the fusion (f) proteins 10 strains bovine respiratory syncytial virus
(brsv) compared radioimmunoprecipitation fractionation on
sds-polyacrylamide gels. two different molecular weights (15 kda 20 kda) of
the f2 proteins demonstrated among brsv strains tested. delineate the
molecular basis differences molecular weights f2 subunits among the
brsv strains, nucleotide sequences f genes fs1 vc464 strains
were determined cdna clones. deduced amino acid sequences then
compared brsv strains rb94, 391-2 a51908. f gene highly
conserved (> 95%) among brsv strains. comparison deduced f2 amino acid
sequences showed strain f2 subunits 20 kda three n-linked
glycosylation sites, whereas strains f2 subunits 15 kda two
n-linked glycosylation sites. analysis f2 subunits deglycosylated
forms indicated difference molecular weights f2 subunits
was due difference extent glycosylation.
