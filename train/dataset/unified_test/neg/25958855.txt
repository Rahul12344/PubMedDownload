human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rna virus prone high
rates mutation. disease managed current antiretroviral
therapies, drugs new mode action needed. strategy towards this
goal aimed targeting native three-dimensional fold conserved rna
structures. perspective highlights medium-sized peptides peptidomimetics
used target two conserved rna structures hiv-1. particular, branched
peptides capacity bind multivalent fashion, utilizing large
surface area achieve necessary affinity selectivity toward target 
rna.
