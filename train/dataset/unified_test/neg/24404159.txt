background: study, aim identify key climatic factors are
associated transmission japanese encephalitis virus areas located 
near three gorges dam, 1997 2008.
methods: identified three geographical regions chongqing, based their
distance three gorges dam. collectively, three regions consisted 
12 districts study information collected. zero-inflated poisson
regression models run identify key climatic factors transmission
of japanese encephalitis virus whole study area each
individual region; linear regression models conducted examine the
fluctuation climatic variables time construction three 
gorges dam.
results: 1997 2008, incidence japanese encephalitis decreased 
throughout entire city chongqing, noticeable variations taking place 
in 2000, 2001 2006. eastern region, closest three gorges 
dam, suffered highest incidence japanese encephalitis, western
region experienced lowest incidence. linear regression models revealed that
there seasonal fluctuations climatic variables period.
zero-inflated poisson regression models indicated significant positive
association temperature (with lag 1 3 months) japanese
encephalitis incidence, significant negative association rainfall
(with lag 0 4 months) japanese encephalitis incidence.
conclusion: spatial temporal trends japanese encephalitis incidence
that occurred city chongqing associated temperature and
rainfall. seasonal fluctuations climatic variables period were
also observed. additional studies focus long-term data collection are
needed validate findings study explore effects 
of three gorges dam japanese encephalitis related diseases.
