a considerable proportion liver transplantation recipients receive
hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig) monotherapy hepatitis b virus (hbv)
prophylaxis develop resistance hbig. retrospectively assessed efficacy 
of hbv prophylaxis 1524 patients received primary high-dose hbig
monotherapy (n = 1463) preemptive antiviral add-on secondary
combination therapy (n = 61). median follow-up time 57 months, 106 (7.3%)
patients receiving hbig monotherapy experienced hbv recurrence, 10-year
hbv recurrence rate 9.8%, compared none patients receiving
preemptive combination therapy (p = 0.047). thirteen patients (12.3%) hbv
recurrence failed antiviral therapy, leading death retransplantation.
response rates rescue therapy use adefovir/entecavir 
44.4% 91.8%, respectively. acute exacerbation associated with
treatment failure, required prolonged treatment. 84 surviving patients
with hbv recurrence, 44 (52.4%) showed evidence blood hbv dna. the
gly145arg mutation found 11 15 (73.3%) patients, whereas 25 71
(35.2%), 2 29 (6.9%), 4 8 (50%) patients resistant lamivudine, 
adefovir, entecavir, respectively. conclusion, finding 10-year
hbv recurrence rate 9.8% patients receiving high-dose hbig monotherapy
indicates treatment effective requires complementary measures.
strict surveillance following hbig monotherapy necessary enhance responses 
to rescue antiviral therapy. preemptive conversion combination therapy a
complementary role prophylaxis primary high-dose hbig monotherapy,
especially patients high risk hbv recurrence.
