characterization cross-reacting antigens epstein-barr virus envelope
and plasma membranes producer cells.

thorley-lawson da.

a rabbit antiserum prepared b95-8 transforming strain of
ebv. antiserum high virus neutralizing titer (approximately 1:1000)
against marmoset b95-8 ebv human p3hr-1 ebv. neutralizing
antibodies may absorbed completely ebv producer cell lines, 
nonproducer cell lines producer cell lines treated phosphonoacetic acid
(paa) nonproducer. repeated absorption paa-treated b95-8, 
the serum remains reactive membranes producer cell lines judged by
immunofluorescence 125i--staphylococcal protein radioimmunoassay. thus
the neutralizing antigens expressed membranes producer cell lines
and may purified source using serum 125i--staph binding as
an assay. ability serum differentiate producer and
nonproducer cells means cell surface determinants exploited to
achieve separation two populations culture.
immunoprecipitation protein technique shows serum recognizes
two polypeptides producer cells approximate molecular weights 150,000 and
75,000.
