aim: aim study determine long-term effects in
non-responders (nrs) 48-week interferon (ifn) ribavirin combination
treatment patients infected hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotype 1b high 
baseline viral loads.
methods: measured serum alanine aminotransferase (alt) hcv-rna levels in
52 consecutive patients infected hcv genotype 1b high viral loads who
received combination therapy 48 weeks.
results: sustained virologic response (svr) noted 30 patients (57.7%).
virologic response (vr), serum hcv-rna negativity end treatment
and positivity follow-up, noted nine patients (17.3%). thirteen
(25.0%) patients nrs. significantly lower serum albumin (p = 0.007) and
ribavirin doses according body weight (p = 0.021) higher gamma glutamyl
transpeptidase (ggt,p = 0.038) noted baseline nr group the
svr vr groups. alt normalization rates six months completion 
treatment 55.6% (5/9) vr 61.5% (8/13) nrs. sustained alt
normalization two years completion treatment noted 55.6%
(5/9) 58.3% (7/12), respectively.
conclusion: study indicates high rate alt normalization patients
infected hcv genotype 1b high baseline viral loads received
combination therapy rate could maintained completion
of therapy, even nrs. results suggest combination therapy be
continued nrs show alt normalization order prevent potential
hepatocarcinogenesis.
