activation il1b gene transcription shown play crucial role in
human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection. previously reported hcmv
immediate-early (ie) proteins vigorously transactivate il1b expression without
the need normally essential upstream enhancer. activation appears to
depend upon protein-protein tethering ie2, provides transcription
activation domain (tad), dna-binding domain transcription factor
spi-1. show distinct mechanism ie1 ie2 mediate weak
spi-1-independent vigorous spi-1-dependent il1b transcription -59 to
+12 il1b core promoter. results demonstrate contrast non-viral, 
enhancer-mediated, transactivation il1b, ie mechanism absolutely
dependent upon spi-1. however, spi-1 required vigorous transcription.
additionally, discovered ie1, cooperates ie2 to
transactivate il1b, minimal activity absence ie2 spi-1.
furthermore, ie1 dual-acting factor, either activate repress
il1b, depending presence ie2 spi-1 tads. therefore, the
relative expression ie1 ie2, varies hcmv infection, may
provide molecular mechanism il1b repressed, thus, avoiding
clearance host.
