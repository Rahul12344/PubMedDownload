cell-mediated autoimmunity strongly implicated pathogenesis of
vascular injury takayasu's arteritis. cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) 
natural killer (nk)cells, playing major part cell-mediated cytotoxicity, are
thought kill virus-infected cells tumor cells effector molecules
contained cytoplasmic granules, one named pore-forming
protein perforin. perforin expected play central role granule
exocytosis model lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis, exhibited ctls nk cells
as well gamma delta lymphocytes. found perforin expressed in
these killer lymphocytes infiltrated aortic tissue patients with
takayasu's arteritis. immunoelectron microscopic study demonstrated the
infiltrating cells directly injured vascular cells releasing perforin
molecules, indicating critical role perforin vascular injury
involved takayasu's arteritis.
