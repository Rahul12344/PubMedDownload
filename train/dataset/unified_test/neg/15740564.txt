induction thymoglobuline, potent anti-thymocyte polyclonal antibody, has
been recently reported allow minimization postoperative immunosuppression
in organ transplantation. relationship recurrence hepatitis c virus
(hcv) liver transplantation (ltx) never investigated. report
here outcome 22 hcv+ patients receiving thymoglobuline pre-treatment
and minimal immunosuppression ltx. patient survival acute rejection
rates good, remarkably low dosages levels immunosuppression 
achieved thymoglobuline, without exposing patients elevated risk of
rejection. progressive weaning primary immunosuppressor also
possible majority patients without complications. hcv recurrence
rate similar reported literature, although lower hcv-rna
viral loads obtained thymoglobuline, mild histologic course.
although results need validated large cohort studies, experience
shows minimization immunosuppression thymoglobuline effective 
protecting rejection demonstrated positive impact hcv recurrence
that deserves investigation.
