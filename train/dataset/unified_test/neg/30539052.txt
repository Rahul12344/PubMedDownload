it occurs. report 12 resistant citrus genotypes among 160 accessions
evaluated. 90 days infestation with viruliferous mites, asymptomatic
genotypes observed sour orange, lemon, grapefruit, mandarins, tangelo,
and tangor groups. results revealed promising genotypes resistant the
disease, incorporated citrus breeding programs aiming obtain
varietal resistance, confirmed susceptibility many citrus genotypes to
cilv-c. assay ratify already reported uneven level susceptibility
