background aims: recombinant adenoviruses tremendous potential gene 
therapy research therapeutic applications. mesenchymal stromal cells a
set several properties make ideally suited regenerative
medicine gene drug delivery. limitation adenoviral-mediated gene
transfer indeed poor transduction rate of cells low levels of
the specific adenoviral cell surface receptor coxsackie virus adenovirus
receptor (car), human mesenchymal stromal cells. present work, 
tried increase adenovirus transduction level mediated gene delivery of
human adipose stem cells use valproic acid (vpa) determined the
proper concentration duration treatment alone combination with
viraductin adenovirus transduction reagent.
methods: green fluorescent protein-expressing recombinant adenovirus was
propagated. effects various doses exposure periods vpa car
expression human adipose stem cells speculated quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction adenoviral transduction rate flow cytometry in
different doses time intervals vpa combination viraductin
transduction reagent.
results: car messenger rna upregulation vpa observed human adipose
stem cells; dependent factor dose exposure time. consequently,
adenoviral transduction level human adipose stem cells treated vpa was
increased, co-administration vpa viraductin enhanced the
transduction rate.
conclusions: results confirm addition vpa hascs alone in
combination viraductin enhancing effects adenoviral transduction
rate, auspicious adenoviral-mediated gene therapy.
