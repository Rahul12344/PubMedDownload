bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv-1) induces fibropapillomas natural host 
and transform fibroblasts culture. viral genome maintained an
episome within fibroblasts, allowed extensive genetic analyses the
viral functions required dna replication, gene expression, and
transformation. much less known bpv-1 gene expression replication in
bovine epithelial cells study complete viral life cycle
requires experimental system capable generating fully differentiated
stratified bovine epithelium. using combination organotypic raft cultures
and xenografts nude mice, developed system bpv-1 can
replicate produce infectious viral particles. organotypic cultures were
established bovine keratinocytes plated collagen raft containing
bpv-1-transformed fibroblasts. keratinocytes infected virus
particles isolated bovine wart transfected cloned bpv-1 dna. 
several days rafts lifted air interface, grafted 
on nude mice. 6-8 weeks, large xenografts produced exhibited a
hyperplastic hyperkeratotic epithelium overlying large dermal fibroma.
these lesions strikingly similar fibropapilloma caused bpv-1 
natural host. amplified viral dna capsid antigens detected the
suprabasal cells epithelium. moreover, infectious virus particles could be
isolated lesions quantitated focus formation assay mouse
cells culture. interestingly, analysis grafts produced infected and
uninfected fibroblasts indicated fibroma component required 
productive infection morphological changes characteristic of
papillomavirus-infected epithelium. system powerful tool the
genetic analysis roles viral gene products complete viral
life cycle.
