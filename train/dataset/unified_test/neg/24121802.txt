in italy, west nile virus (wnv) equine outbreaks occurred annually since
2008. characterizing wnv vector habitat requirements allows the
identification areas risk viral amplification transmission.
maxent-based ecological niche models developed using literature records of
13 potential wnv italian vector mosquito species predict habitat
suitability range investigate possible geographical associations wnv 
equine outbreak occurrence italy 2008 2010. contribution of
different environmental variables niche models also assessed. suitable
habitats culex pipiens, aedes albopictus, anopheles maculipennis were
widely distributed; culex modestus, ochlerotatus geniculatus, ochlerotatus
caspius, coquillettidia richiardii, aedes vexans, anopheles plumbeus were
concentrated north-central italy; aedes cinereus, culex theileri, ochlerotatus
dorsalis, culiseta longiareolata restricted coastal/southern areas.
elevation, temperature, precipitation variables showed highest predictive
power. host population landscape variables provided minor contributions. wnv 
equine outbreaks significantly higher probability occur habitats
suitable cx. modestus cx. pipiens, providing circumstantial evidence that
the potential distribution two species coincides geographically the
observed distribution disease equines.
