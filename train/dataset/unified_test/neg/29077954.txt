infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) great economic burden productive 
losses costs control strategies. many different vaccination protocols 
are applied region even consecutive cycles farm in
order find perfect balance costs benefits. northern italy, 
the usual second vaccination often moved chick's first
d life. second strain administration together common mass priming
by spray hatchery allows saving money time reducing animal stress.
the present work compared different vaccine strains (mass-like b48, and
1/96) kinetics field conditions 21-day-long experimental trial
in broilers, monitoring viral replication upper respiratory tract swabbing
and vaccine specific real time reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) quantification.
in field experimental conditions, titers vaccines showed 
increasing trend first 2 wk decrease, though still remaining
detectable whole monitored period. ibv field strain avian
metapneumovirus (ampv) presence also also investigated rt-pcr and
sequencing, multiplex real-time rt-pcr, respectively, revealing a
consistency pathogen introduction timing around 30 d, correspondence
with vaccine titer's main decrease. findings suggest need an
accurate knowledge live vaccine kinetics, whose replication compete with
the pathogen one, providing additional protection added is
conferred adaptive immune response.
