the gene encoding specific antigen (s antigen) induced surface of
vaccinia virus-infected cells mapped viral genome construction 
of recombinant viruses. gene located 1.5-kbp xbai-accii fragment 
between 11.1 12.6 kbp right end viral genome. nucleotide
sequencing fragment revealed open reading frame (orf) 351 codons
capable producing polypeptide molecular weight (mw) 40,701 da.
mapping mrna primer extension indicates presence the
transcription initiation site precedes translation initiation codon by
14 nucleotides. region preceding mrna start site extremely a/t-rich 
and sequence similarity early genes. signal termination of
transcription early genes, tttttat, included near end orf.
the deduced amino acid sequence contains typical membrane signal characterized 
by hydrophobic region n-terminus. early polypeptide mw 40
kda, agreement size predicted orf, synthesized by
cell-free translation mrna selected hybridization plasmid
containing region orf.
