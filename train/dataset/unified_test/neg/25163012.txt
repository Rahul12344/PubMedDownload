molecular biological characterization distinct strains jatropha mosaic 
virus dominican republic reveal potential infect crop plants.

melgarejo ta, kon t, gilbertson rl.

in dominican republic (do), jatropha plants yellow mosaic symptoms are
commonly observed around fields various crop plants. complete
nucleotide sequences dna-a dna-b components four bipartite begomovirus 
isolates associated symptomatic jatropha plants collected three
geographical locations determined. sequence comparisons revealed
highest identities (91 92%) dna-a component isolate jatropha
mosaic virus (jmv) jamaica, indicating bipartite begomovirus
isolates strains jmv. introduced jatropha seedlings 
by particle bombardment, cloned components jmv strains do
induced stunting yellow mosaic, indistinguishable symptoms observed in
the field, thereby fulfilling koch's postulates disease. jmv strains 
also induced disease symptoms nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco, several
cultivars common bean andean gene pool, including one locally grown
in do. asymmetry infectivity symptomatology pseudorecombinants 
provided support strain designation jmv isolates 
do. thus, jmv complex genetically distinct strains have
undergone local evolution potential cause disease crop plants.
