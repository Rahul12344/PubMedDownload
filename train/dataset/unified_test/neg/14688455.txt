the influence hepatitis b virus (hbv) genotypes natural history the
response treatment patients chronic hepatitis b potential
interest. compared patients hbv genotype c, genotype b
were younger age higher cumulative rate hepatitis b e antigen
(hbeag) seroconversion initial 6 years follow-up. earlier hbeag
seroconversion patients genotype b, however, provide them
with benefit terms reduced risk developing long-term complications. 
the response lamivudine therapy evaluated 21 patients infected hbv
genotype b (all subtype ba) 61 genotype c. differences 
in virological response lamivudine therapy, based reduction in
median logarithmic hbv dna titer well alanine aminotransferase (alt)
