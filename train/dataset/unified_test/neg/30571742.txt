a strain zika virus (zikv) asian origin associated birth defects and
neurological disorders emerged spread americas. zikv was
first isolated blood nonhuman primates africa detected 
in blood, saliva, urine catarrhine species africa and
asia, suggesting nonhuman primates may serve source a
reservoir virus. recent introduction zikv human populations in
the americas presents potential virus spread nonhuman primate
reservoirs. thus, critical develop efficient noninvasive detection
methods monitor spread virus wild nonhuman primate populations. 
here, describe method zikv detection noninvasively collected fecal
samples neotropical primate. fecal samples collected two captive
squirrel monkeys (saimiri boliviensis boliviensis) experimentally
infected zikv (strain mexico_1_44) additional two uninfected squirrel
monkeys. nucleic acids extracted samples, rt-qpcr used to
assay presence zikv using primers flanking 101 bp region ns5 
gene. zikv-inoculated animals, zikv detected 5-11 days
post-infection, detected uninfected animals. compare the
fecal results zikv detection serum, saliva, urine samples same
individuals. results indicate fecal detection cost-effective,
noninvasive method monitoring wild populations neotropical primates as
possible zikv reservoirs.
