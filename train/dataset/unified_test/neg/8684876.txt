objective: compare safety immunogenicity one- vs. two-dose
regimen oka/merck varicella vaccine approximately 2000 healthy children 12 
months 12 years age.
methodology: subjects negative history varicella randomized to
receive either one two injections vaccine given 3 months apart were
followed clinical reactions serologic response (glycoprotein-based
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
results: one- two-dose vaccine regimens generally well-tolerated.
the incidences varicelliform rash fever less frequent the
second injection. however, slight increase incidence injection site
reactions noted second injection; generally mild.
seroconversion rates glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were
98.2% (1700 1731) one injection 99.9% (717 718) two
injections. significant (p < 0.001) boost geometric mean titers observed
in children received second injection vaccine 3 months first
injection. children seroconverted 6 weeks postregimen (one two
doses assigned), 99.8% (528 529) one-dose group 99.8% (473 of
474) two-dose group maintained antibody varicella 1 year with
geometric mean titers 19.5 31.2, respectively.
conclusions: administration one- two-dose regimen live oka/merck
varicella vaccine (varivax) immunogenic generally well-tolerated in
healthy children 1 12 years old. antibody varicella persists > 99% of
vaccinees 1 year vaccination regardless one- two-dose regimen.
long-term follow-up studies cohort children may determine whether a
two-dose regimen offers superior protection chickenpox.
