the deduced sigma-2 protein sequence s3 gene segment novel turkey
reovirus, designated nc98, isolated bursa birds exhibiting poult
enteritis mortality syndrome determined. isolate, serologically
distinct avian reoviruses, isolated turkey embryo kidney cells 
and rna purified cdna synthesis. oligonucleotide primers designed
based conserved avian s3 nucleotide sequence data. nc98 s3 open reading
frame comprised 1,101 base pairs encoded 366 amino acids predicated
molecular mass 40.5 kda. although s3 nucleotide sequence several
chicken isolates share least 86% identity, share 64% nc98
turkey isolate. interestingly, s3 nucleotide sequence muscovy duck
reovirus shares 55% identity nc98 53% identity chicken isolates. as
observed avian reovirus sigma2 protein sequences, zinc-binding motif
and double-stranded rna binding domain found within predicted amino acid
sequence nc98. phylogenetic analysis deduced sigma2 sequence
demonstrated nc98 separated distinct virus relative avian
strains. results study indicate nc98 novel turkey reovirus 
that shares limited genomic sequence identity isolates chicken duck
origin considered separate virus species within subgroup 2 the
orthoreovirus genus.
