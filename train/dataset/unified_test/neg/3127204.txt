the bacillus subtilis phage luminal diameter 29 dna polymerase, involved in
protein-primed viral dna replication, inhibited phosphonoacetic acid
(paa), known inhibitor alpha-like dna polymerases, decreasing rate of
elongation. three highly conserved regions amino acid homology, found in
several viral alpha-like dna polymerases luminal diameter 29 dna
polymerase, one proposed paa binding site, also found in
the t4 dna polymerase. prokaryotic enzyme highly sensitive drugs 
aphidicolin nucleotide analogues butylanilino datp (buadatp) and
butylphenyl dgtp (bupdgtp), known specific inhibitors eukaryotic
alpha-like dna polymerases. two potential dna polymerases linear plasmid
pgkl1 yeast s1 mitochondrial dna maize identified,
based fact contain three conserved regions amino acid
homology. comparison dna polymerases prokaryotic eukaryotic origin
showed extensive amino acid homology addition highly conserved domains.
these findings reflect evolutionary relationships hypothetically
unrelated dna polymerases.
