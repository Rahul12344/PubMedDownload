viral persistence chronic viral infections associated a
progressive loss t-cell effector function called functional exhaustion. 
is therefore need develop immunotherapies remediate functional
deficits cells infections. investigated the
immunotherapeutic effects il-7 chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus infection mice. results showed effects il-7 cells
depend viral load, timing, duration treatment course 
the infection. document effectiveness il-7 constrained high
viral load early infection, treatment least 3 weeks during
declining viral titers mitigated programmed contraction cd8 cells,
markedly enhanced number high-quality polyfunctional virus-specific cd8 
cells nonexhausted phenotype, accelerated viral control.
mechanistically, enhancement cd8 t-cell responses il-7 associated
with increased proliferation induction bcl-2, altered levels 
of pd-1 cbl-b. summary, results strongly suggest il-7 therapy a
potential strategy bolster quality quantity t-cell responses in
patients chronic viral infections.
