because time primary infection symptoms human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection typically 8-10 years, use surrogate
markers monitor disease progression therapeutic efficacy interest.
an acid dissociation procedure disrupts p24 antigen-antibody complexes
found early hiv-1 infection greatly increased sensitivity p24
detection assays. utility p24 antigen acid treatment surrogate 
marker disease progression therapeutic effect asymptomatic hiv-infected
subjects receiving zidovudine (azt) determined. acid treatment, the
sensitivity p24 antigen detection increased fivefold. proportion of
subjects antigenemic increased 48-week follow-up placebo
group; approximately 50% subjects p24 antigen-positive entry and
who received azt showed clearance greater 50% reduction baseline p24
antigen levels 16 32 weeks. thus, acid treatment plasma may allow the
use p24 antigen marker disease progression therapeutic response.
