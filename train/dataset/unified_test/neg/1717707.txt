an atypical syncytial variant high-grade burkitt's-type b-cell lymphoma from
a patient aids seropositive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
was studied. productive type retrovirus infection identified in
early-passage cell lines derived two lymphomas patient. nucleotide
and amino acid sequence analysis well immunologic reactivity indicated that
the isolated virus highly related mason-pfizer monkey virus (mpmv). mpmv
is immunosuppressive type retrovirus causes aids-like syndrome in
rhesus macaques. amplification dna patient's diagnostic bone marrow
biopsy specimen polymerase chain reaction generated appropriate
mpmv-specific fragments indicated patient infected the
mpmv-like retrovirus. addition, patient's serum contained antibodies which
recognized type viral env proteins (gp70 gp20) gag proteins (p27 and
p14). although reports human cell lines infected type d
retroviruses type d-reactive human sera, first evidence a
type retrovirus infection human confirmed virus isolation, serum
reactivity, viral dna identification tumor tissue.
