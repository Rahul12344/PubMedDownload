aim: aim present study describe salivary shedding human 
herpesviruses (hhv) renal transplant recipients observe oral
manifestations group.
methods: prospective case-control study conducted study group 20 
renal transplant recipients control group 20 non-transplanted,
immunocompetent individuals. clinical examination evaluated presence of
drug-induced gingival overgrowth (digo), salivary flow, caries. stimulated
saliva collected groups, hhv detected using real-time
polymerase chain reaction.
results: mean age study group 45.90 ± 9.89 years, 55% (11/20)
being female, 60% (12/20) caucasian, 65% (13/20) deceased donor,
and 70% (14/20) used tacrolimus main immunosuppressive drug. renal 
transplant recipients shedding herpesviruses compared control 
group, exception hhv-7. statistical significance found herpes
simplex virus-1 (hsv-1) (p = 0.017) cytomegalovirus (p = 0.035). digo was
observed seven patients (35%), 35% (7/20) presenting decreased
salivary flow four (20%) reporting xerostomia.
conclusion: renal transplant recipients excreted herpesviruses often than
control individuals, especially hsv-1. decreased salivary flow xerostomia
were frequent patients used tacrolimus, whereas used
cyclosporine cases digo.
