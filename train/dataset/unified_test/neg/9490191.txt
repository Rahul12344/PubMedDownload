background: accidents resulting percutaneous exposure account for
approximately one third accidents suffered work health workers in
hospitals. importance lies illnesses caused pathogens be
transmitted way (hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hiv virus). aims to
describe accidents type notified tertiary level hospital, identify
factors associated accidents nursing staff build predictive
model individual risk accident.
methods: descriptive study retrospective cohort made people 
who notified suffered accident 1-1-93 30-6-96. study of
cases controls nursing staff period 1-1-95 30-6-96, analysed
through multiple logistical regression.
results: cumulative incidence cases accidents one year 0.078 for
male female nurses. 57.3% cases, disposable pre-loaded syringes were
involved. cumulative incidence cases one year greater for
intravenous catheterisation (8.5% per 100,000). risk accident,
adjusted account confusing variables, greater female male
nurses (or = 3.22; i.c.95% = 1.96-5.27), workers haemodialysis unit (or
= 35.21; i.c.95% = 3.74-331.16) employed temporary contract
(or = 4.50; i.c.95% = 2.24-9.04).
conclusions: accidents resulting percutaneous exposure hospital 
more frequent among nursing staff basically caused type hollow 
needles. factors associated accidents identified, allowing
specific prevention programmes targeted workers greater risk.
the model obtained valid estimate degree individual accident
probability subjects studied.
