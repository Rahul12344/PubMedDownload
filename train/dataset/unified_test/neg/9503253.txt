like affective spectrum. since dysregulation serotonin
transporter expression might important course disorders, we
isolated cloned 5'-regulatory region serotonin transporter gene,
which inducible camp- pkc-depended signal transduction pathways.
systematic screening length variations functional promoter analyses
revealed genetic polymorphism allelic variation transcriptional
activity protein expression. 5-htt gene polymorphism comprises a
tandemly repeated sequence 5'-regulatory promoter region serotonin 
transporter gene. recent population association studies demonstrated 5-htt
gene promoter polymorphism accounting 4-5% population variation of
anxiety-related behavioral traits.
