background/purpose: treatment daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (dcv + asv) for
24 weeks provided sustained virologic response (svr) rate 90% in
hepatitis c virus genotype 1b (hcv-1b) infected patients without non-structural
5a (ns5a) resistance-associated substitutions (rass) l31 y93 sites. in
this study, investigated whether adding ribavirin dcv + asv combination
could shorten original treatment regimen 12 weeks without compromising the
treatment efficacy hcv-1b patients without ns5a rass.
methods: prospective, open-label, single-arm, nationwide multi-center
phase iii study, total 70 interferon-naïve interferon-experienced hcv-1b 
patients without baseline l31/y93 rass received daclatasvir (60 mg/day) and
asunaprevir (100 mg twice daily) plus weight-based ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day)
for 12 weeks, 12-week post-treatment follow-up. primary end-point 
the rate undetectable hcv rna 12 weeks post-treatment (svr12).
results: svr12 rate 97.1% (68/70) 100% (68/68) the
full-analysis-set per-protocol population, respectively. none 68
patients completed 12-week treatment experienced relapse during
post-treatment follow-up. two patients withdrew study treatment days 
21 34 due anorexia fatigue, considered ribavirin-related
and resolved post medication cessation. total 4 serious adverse events 
reported considered treatment-unrelated. deaths grade 4 adverse events 
requiring hospitalization observed throughout study.
