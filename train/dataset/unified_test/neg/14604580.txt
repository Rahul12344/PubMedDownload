protection schistosoma mansoni infection c57bl/6 female mice was
evaluated two dna vaccination strategies. mice either vaccinated by
intramuscular injection pcdnai/amp constructs encoding either cu/zn
cytosolic superoxide dismutase (ct-sod), signal peptide-containing sod (sp-sod), 
glutathione peroxidase (gpx(bb)) mutated form gpx (gpx(m)), primed
with naked dna constructs boosted recombinant vaccinia virus (rvv)
containing genes. animals challenged s. mansoni the
level protection assessed reduction worm burden. ct-sod showed
significant levels protection compared control group, ranging between
44 60%, sp-sod exhibited 22 45%. gpx(bb) showed levels of
protection (23-55%) higher gpx(m) (25-34%). prime-boost strategy gave
the results naked dna recombinant vaccinia virus alone except the
case gpx, protection 85%.
