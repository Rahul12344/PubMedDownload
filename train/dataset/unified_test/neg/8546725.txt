objective: report antiinflammatory antiviral effects of
hydroxychloroquine (hcq) treatment 2 patients aids inflammatory
arthritis.
methods: two patients aids inflammatory arthritis treated hcq,
which given loading dose 600 mg/day. maintenance dosage was
calculated remain 6.5 mg/kg/day. patients initial cell subset
studies; 1 patient, serum plasma collected 1 year hcq
treatment. assays performed cell subsets, recoverable human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rna, mitogen- antigen-specific
proliferation, interleukin-6 (il-6) levels. new studies use hcq 
an anti-hiv-1 agent reviewed.
results: patients dramatic decrease arthritis activity.
neither patient required immunosuppressive therapy developed opportunistic 
infection. patient studied 1 year therapy, a
1-log decrease recoverable hiv-1 rna, improved mitogen- antigen-specific
immune responses, large decrease il-6 level taking hcq. recent
in vitro vivo assays patients hiv infection shown similar
antiviral antiinflammatory effects hcq.
conclusion: hcq may exert simultaneous anti-inflammatory antiviral effects in
patients hiv infection inflammatory arthritis. larger studies confirm
this observation, may drug choice population patients.
