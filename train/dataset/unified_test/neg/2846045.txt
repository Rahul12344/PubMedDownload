the ability escherichia coli nus protein recognize specific dna rna
sequences vitro tested using transcription templates containing a
variety promoters, transcription terminators, antitermination-conferring
regions. conclude effects nus termination not
qualitatively quantitatively altered sequences present promoters,
rho-dependent terminators, antitermination-conferring regions. nus also 
shown increase termination rrnc rho-independent t1 terminator a
mechanism independent promoter sequences involved in
antitermination. altogether, observations argue direct nus
a-nucleic acid interaction affecting termination vitro. together the
results described accompanying paper [sigmund, c. d., & morgan, e. a.
(1988) biochemistry (preceding paper issue)], results suggest 
the effects nus termination vitro may related vivo
