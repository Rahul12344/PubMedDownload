aim: assess clearance rate human papillomavirus (hpv) out-patient
treatment cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin).
methods results: total 122 nicaraguan women hpv dna-positive and
histologically confirmed cin lesions included study. fifty-five
patients cin1 67 cin2-3 treated cryotherapy loop
electrosurgical excision procedure (leep), respectively. follow-up visits were
scheduled 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year 2 years. investigations included
cytology, hpv dna testing colposcopy/biopsy needed. clearance rate 
hpv calculated multivariate logistic regression. immediately after
treatment, pronounced decrease presence hpv observed groups, 
with significantly higher clearance leep group cryotherapy
group (p = 0.019). subsequently, clearance continued time similar
between cryotherapy group leep group (p = 0.73). approximately the
same detection rates obtained persistence hpv types for
high-risk types separately: 43.9, 37.6, 29.9 17.7% cryotherapy group
and 24.9, 20.3, 15.3 8.4% leep group 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year 
2 years, respectively.
conclusions: out-patient treatment precancerous lesions cervix usually 
results clearance hpv. leep cryotherapy highly effective
methods eradicating hpv. hpv dna testing may added value follow-up
of patients.
