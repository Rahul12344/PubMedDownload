with wide availability whole-genome sequencing (wgs), genetic mapping 
become rate-limiting step, inhibiting unbiased forward genetics even the
most tractable model organisms. introduce rapid deconvolution resource and
method untagged causative mutations mutagenesis, screens, wgs in
escherichia coli. created deconvoluter-ordered libraries selectable
insertions every 50 kb e. coli genome. deconvoluter method uses 
for replacement untagged mutations genome using phage-p1-based
gene-replacement strategy. validate deconvoluter resource deconvolution
of 17 17 phenotype-altering mutations screen of
n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea-induced mutants. deconvoluter resource permits rapid
unbiased screens gene/function identification enable exploration 
functions essential genes undiscovered genes/sites/alleles represented
in existing deletion collections. resource unbiased forward-genetic
screens mapping-by-sequencing ('forward genomics') demonstrates strategy
that could similarly enable rapid screens many microbes.
