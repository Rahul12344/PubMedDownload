a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was
developed quantify rna feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) cats. the
assay uses vitro synthesized rna derived gag region fiv genome
as competitive internal control. synthesized rna 22-base deletion
with respect wild-type sequence. pcr products quantitated by
densitometric analysis digitalized image ethidium bromide stained
gel. non-radioactive method evaluated reconstruction experiments. rna 
synthesis fiv-infected feline thymocytes correlated well amount of
viral p24 antigen produced. viral rna concentrations plasma two cats
experimentally infected fiv strain ut113 followed 32 weeks; peak
copy numbers (2.3 x 10(4) 1.3 x 10(4) per ml, respectively) reached 11
weeks subcutaneous injection ten 50% cat infectious doses. rising
antibody titers fiv-gag fiv-env gene products, amount fiv rna 
in plasma decreased. nine asymptomatic cats experimentally infected
3.5 4.5 years earlier copy numbers 5.6 x 10(3) 4.3 x 10(4) per
ml. quantitative competitive rt-pcr useful study pathogenesis
of fiv infection, evaluate effectiveness vaccines monitor
antiviral immunomodulating drugs.
