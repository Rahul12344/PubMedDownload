the competitive inhibitory effects nk4 (a specific hepatocyte growth factor
(hgf)-antagonist) interaction hgf c-met/hgf receptor has
been shown hgf-mediated invasion distinct types human cancer cells.
furthermore, nk4 inhibitory effects angiogenic pathways driven by
basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) vascular endothelial growth factor
(vegf), well hgf. study, evaluate therapeutic efficacy of
adenoviral-mediated nk4 gene treatment, employed animal models peritoneal
metastasis using two gastric cancer cell lines, strongly c-met expressing
mkn45 cell line weakly c-met-expressing cell line, tmk1. models, 
the total number weight peritoneal tumours per mouse ascites treated
early axcank4 (administered 3 times 2, 7 12 days tumour
inoculation) significantly reduced compared treated with
phosphate-buffered solution (pbs) axcalacz (p < 0.05). in
factor-viii-related-antigen-stained sections peritoneal metastatic tumours, 
the inhibition intratumour vessels observed tissues tumours of
mkn45 tmk1 treated axcank4. also compared therapeutic effect of
early axcank4 treatment late treatment (at 7, 12 17 days).
peritoneal metastases ascites treated late axcank4 showed less an
improvement treated early axcank4 models. addition,
the inhibitory effect cisplatin (cddp) peritoneal metastasis was
significantly enhanced axcank4, suggesting combination of
intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy nk4 gene therapy might effective,
even cases advanced peritoneal metastasis gastric cancer. conclude,
these results show clearly nk4 gene therapy inhibits peritoneal metastases
from gastric cancer, regardless level c-met/hgf receptor expression 
the tumour cells, especially early stages peritoneal metastasis.
