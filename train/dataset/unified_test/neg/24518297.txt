the "antigen capsid-incorporation" strategy developed for
adenovirus-based vaccines context several diseases. exogenous antigenic
peptides incorporated adenovirus capsid structure induce robust
and boosted antigen-specific immune response. recently, sought generate a
multivalent adenovirus type 3 (ad3) vaccine vector incorporating multiple
epitopes major adenovirus capsid protein, hexon. present study, a
multivalent recombinant ad3 vaccine (r1r2a3) constructed homologous
recombination, displaying two neutralizing epitopes enterovirus type 71
(ev71) hexon. recombinant virus confirmed pcr, immunoblotting, 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, injected mice analyze the
epitope-specific humoral response. differences found viruses 
with two epitopes incorporated hypervariable regions (hvr1 hvr2) 
hexon ad3egfp, based thermostability growth kinetic tests. the
epitopes thought exposed hexon-modified intact virion surface.
the repeated administration modified adenovirus r1r2a3 balb/c mice
boosted humoral immune response epitopes. immunization with
recombinant virus r1r2a3 elicited higher igg titers higher neutralization
titers ev71 vitro immunization modified adenovirus 
only one epitope incorporated hvr1. study, recombinant r1r2a3
virus expressing two exogenous neutralizing epitopes hexon hvr1 hvr2
induced specific immune responses foreign epitopes. study contributes
to better understanding hexon-modified ad vector multiple-epitope
delivery vehicle.
