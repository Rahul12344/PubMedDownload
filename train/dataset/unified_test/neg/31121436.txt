in work, ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (pec) biosensor proposed
to detect nucleic acids basis cascaded photoactive materials and
triple-helix molecular switch. dna sequence human immunodeficiency virus type 
1 (hiv-1) chosen target dna (t-dna). cascaded photoactive structure
was formed via different sizes cdte quantum dots (qds) sensitized zno nanorods
(zno nrs), employed cascaded photoactive interface amplify 
photocurrent signal. hairpin structure dna (h-dna) capture probe was
conjugated onto photoactive interface amide bond, a
single-stranded dna modified gold nanoparticles labeled alkaline phosphatase
(alp-au nps-dna) end introduced hybridize h-dna form a
triple-helix conformation. t-dna detection based photocurrent
response change resulted conformation change triple-helix molecule
after hybridization t-dna. absence t-dna, triple-helix
molecule closed state alp alp-au nps-dna could specifically
catalyze ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (aap) generate ascorbic acid (aa) as
electron donors, resulted significant photocurrent response due the
rapid electron transfer process. however, presence t-dna, t-dna
hybridized alp-au nps-dna molecule, caused triple-helix molecule
in opened state compelled alp-au nps-dna away electrode surface, 
resulting absence alp could catalyze aap generate aa.
subsequently, photocurrent response significantly decreased. proposed pec
biosensor wide detection range 1fm-1nm low detection limit 
(0.65 fm), also showed excellent reproducibility, specificity stability, 
which great application prospect opened new research method the
early clinical diagnosis cancer research.
