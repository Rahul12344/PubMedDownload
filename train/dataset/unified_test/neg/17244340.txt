minaçu virus isolated ochlerotatus scapularis (diptera: culicidae) in
minaçu, goiás state, brazil, 1996. attempting characterization virus
serological (hemagluttination inhibition, hi; indirect immunofluorescence assay, 
ifa), physicochemical [test deoxycholate acid (dca) sensitivity;
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page)] tests ultrastructural studies were
made. virus also assayed suckling mice intracerebral inoculation 
0.02 ml vero c6/36 cells 0.1 ml viral suspension containing
10(5) ld50/ml. inoculated control systems observed daily. every 24 h,
one control two inoculated animals killed tissue testing, including 
histopathological changes haematoxylin eosin (he)-stained sections, 
were semi-quantified. research viral antigen tissues mice [central
nervous system (cns), liver, heart, lungs, spleen kidneys] carried by
the immunohistochemical technique using peroxidase system. virus only
replicated vero cells, antigen positive ifa. positive complement
fixation tests obtained using antiserum minaçu virus. minaçu virus
is dca resistant; haemagglutinating activity negative. electronic
microscopy non-enveloped virus particles 75 nm diameter. page analysis
showed minaçu virus genome profile 10 rna segments. infected, non-killed
animals died 7 days inoculation. tissue lesions observed all
organs, except lungs. intense lesions observed cns heart,
where neurone cardiocyte necroses, respectively, noted. liver,
spleen kidneys moderate tissue changes. viral antigens abundant
in cns heart, absent lungs. conclusion, minaçu virus
belongs family reoviridae, genus orbivirus.
