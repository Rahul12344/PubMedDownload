the relationship occurrence cryoglobulins hepatitis c virus
(hcv) productive infection peripheral blood bone marrow-derived
lymphocytes explored. hcv minus strand rna, viral replicative
intermediate, searched polya(+) tract strand-specific tth-based
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) lymphoid cells 46 
patients acute chronic infection. hcv minus strand demonstrated 
in rna extracted six (13%) five (11%) peripheral blood bone
marrow-derived lymphocytes, respectively. hcv replicating form lymphoid
cells associated strictly mixed cryoglobulinaemia (mcg), 
found six 13 (46%) mcg patients, including two b cell non-hodgkin's
lymphoma (nhl). traces hcv-negative strand rna found four patients 
with acute hepatitis c, 15 chronic active hepatitis without extrahepatic 
disorders, seven monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance, 
in seven b-nhl without mcg. results emphasize direct role the
virus pathogenesis mcg support contention hcv not
specifically lymphotropic, entry replication lymphoid cells being
determined largely selective interactions.
