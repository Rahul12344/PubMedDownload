the complete nucleotide sequence hemagglutinin (ha) gene human type
b influenza virus b/singapore/222/79 presented. comparison other
known sequence b hemagglutinin (b/lee/40) shows antigenic drift type
b ha genes essentially already observed within influenza h3 
subtype, i.e., accumulation point mutations. main difference that
the apparent evolution significantly slower, likely due cumulative
effect lower occurrence population (slower evolution) and/or less
immunological pressure. striking cluster changes positions 127
until 137 ha1 subunit may represent one antigenic sites of
the molecule.
