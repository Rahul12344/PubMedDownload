influenza viruses worldwide major causative agents human animal
acute respiratory infections. influenza subtypes caused
epidemics pandemics among humans. varieties methods available 
the rapid isolation identification influenza viruses clinical and
environmental samples. since nucleic acids amplification techniques as
rt-pcr adapted, fast sensitive influenza type subtype
determination possible. however, ambiguous cases other, detailed 
assay might desired. genetic material influenza virus highly
unstable constantly mutates. known single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps) results resistance commercially available anti-viral drugs. the
genetic drift virus could also result weakening immune response to
infection. finally, substantial number patients co-infection various
virus strains types confirmed. although detection co-infection
or presence minor genetic variants within flu-infected patients a
routine procedure, rapid wide spectrum diagnostics influenza virus
infections could reveal accurate picture disease importantly, 
is crucial choosing appropriate therapeutics virus monitoring. herein
we present evidences native gel electrophoresis msscp--a method
based multitemperature single strand conformation polymorphism could furnish a
useful technique minor variants, escape discovery conventional
diagnostic assays.
