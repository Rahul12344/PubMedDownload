plyc, bacteriophage-encoded endolysin, lyses streptococcus pyogenes (spy) on
contact. here, demonstrate plyc potent agent controlling
intracellular spy often underlies refractory infections. show the
plyc holoenzyme, mediated plycb subunit, crosses epithelial cell membranes
and clears intracellular spy dose-dependent manner. quantitative studies
using model membranes establish plycb interacts strongly with
phosphatidylserine (ps), whereas interaction lipids weak,
suggesting specificity ps cellular receptor. neutron reflection
further substantiates plyc penetrates bilayers ps threshold
concentration. crystallography docking studies identify key residues that
mediate plycb-ps interactions, validated site-directed mutagenesis. 
this first report native endolysin traverse epithelial
membranes, thus substantiating potential plyc antimicrobial spy 
in extracellular intracellular milieu scaffold engineering
other functionalities.
