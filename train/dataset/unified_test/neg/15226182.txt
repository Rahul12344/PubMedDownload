in immortal cells, existence mechanism maintenance telomere
length critical. cases achieved reactivation of
telomerase, cellular reverse transcriptase prevents telomere shortening.
here report telomerase gene (htert) promoter up-regulated during
transmission human t-cell lymphotropic virus type-i (htlv-i) primary t
cells vitro ex vivo adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma (atll) samples, 
not asymptomatic carriers. although tax impaired induction human telomerase
reverse transcriptase (htert) mrna response mitogenic stimulation,
transduction tax primary lymphocytes sufficient activate and
maintain telomerase expression telomere length cultured absence
of exogenous stimulation. transient transfection assays revealed tax
stimulates htert promoter nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab)
pathway. consistently, tax mutants inactive nf-kappab activation could not
activate htert sustain telomere length transduced primary lymphocytes. 
analysis htert promoter occupancy vivo using chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays suggested increased binding c-myc sp1
is involved nf-kappab-mediated activation htert promoter. this
study establishes role tax regulation telomerase expression, which
may cooperate functions tax promote htlv-i-associated adult
t-cell leukemia.
