enzymatically derived fragments nucleocapsid protein one strain (v4) 
of paramyxovirus, new castle disease virus (ndv), aligned 
sequence deduced related strain (d26) gene sequence analysis. this
process involved extensive use fast atom bombardment (fab) mass spectrometry
of unfractionated tryptic digests fragments separated tryptic aspn
protease digests high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). amino acid
analysis stepwise edman degradation sequence analysis used complement
fab mass spectral data alternatives ions produced fab. the
nature biosynthetic processing blockage (acetylation) n-terminus of
the protein confirmed using collision-induced dissociation. data obtained by
direct analysis v4 nucleocapsid protein facilitated mapping sequence
variations within nucleocapsid protein antigenically distinct wa2116
strain ndv. wa2116 protein mapped fab mass spectrometric
analysis hplc fractions, thus amino acid analysis stepwise sequence
analysis required fab mass spectral data inconclusive or
indicated amino acid variations. approach comparison ndv nucleocapsid 
proteins proposed general strategy mapping strain variation and
post-translational modifications viral proteins.
