recent technical breakthroughs generating soluble mhc class i-peptide
tetramers allow direct visualization virus-specific cd8 cells 
infection vivo. however, technique requires knowledge the
immunodominant viral epitopes recognized cells. here, describe an
alternative approach visualize polyclonal virus-specific cd8 cells vivo
using simple adoptive transfer system. approach, c57bl/6 (thy1.2) mice
were infected lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, vesicular stomatitis
virus, vaccinia virus induce virus-specific memory cells. tracer cells 
(2 x 106) virus-immune mice adoptively transferred into
nonirradiated (c57bl/6 x b6.pl-thy-1a)f1 mice. infection the
f1-recipient mice appropriate virus, transferred cells expanded
vigorously, day 8 postinfection 60-80% total cd8 cells donor 
t cell origin. conditions memory cd4 cells gave rise least
10 times less cell numbers memory cd8 cells. transfer system described
here allows visualize effector memory cd8 cells vivo but
also isolate vitro characterization without knowing the
epitopes recognized ag-specific cd8 cells.
