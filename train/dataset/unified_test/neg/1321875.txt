monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific equine herpesvirus type 1 (ehv-1)
glycoprotein 60 (gp60) gp 17/18 (f3132 5h6 respectively) found to
react protein, identified homologue herpes
simplex virus type 1 gd. mab f3132 strongly neutralized virus infectivity and
inhibited penetration virus cell. effects penetration 
were shared three mabs protein (p68, f3116 f3129),
but effect virus penetration found anti-ehv-1 mab
tested. level glycosylation gp60 analysed using glycanase enzymes
and glycosylation inhibitors, consisted mainly n-linked carbohydrate. 
m(r) non-n-glycosylated gp60 50k.
