parvovirus b19 (b19) human pathogen transmitted susceptible individuals
via respiratory secretions contaminated blood blood products. b19 levels
in pooled plasma less 10(4) genome equivalents/ml may infectious, 
while greater 10(7)/ml capable transmitting infection. world 
health organization (who) b19 dna international standard recently
introduced. purpose present work develop pcr-enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (pcr-elisa) calibrated b19 dna international 
standard could easily reliably detect b19 dna levels plasma above
10(4) iu/ml (6.5 x 10(3) genome equivalents/ml). b19 pcr-elisa system was
developed uses dinitrophenylated oligonucleotide probe detect
immobilized biotinylated amplicons following single-round pcr amplification. 
level b19 dna (in international units per milliliter) individual pooled
plasma specimens evaluated. proteinase k treatment plasma found 
sufficient quantitatively release b19 dna. b19 pcr-elisa sensitivity
of detection 1.6 x 10(3) iu/ml b19 dna dynamic range extending 8 to
1,000 iu b19 dna (equivalent 1.6 x 10(3) 2 x 10(5) iu b19 dna/ml).
furthermore, antibody profile pooled plasma products determined in
terms b19 immunoglobulin g (igg) (in international units per milliliter). 
b19 igg level found 64.7 +/- 17.5 iu/ml (mean +/- standard deviation). 
the b19 pcr-elisa, calibrated b19 dna international
standard, may application rapid screening plasma minipools for
b19 dna, thereby leading improvement blood product safety.
