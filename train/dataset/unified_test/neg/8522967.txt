mice infected retrovirus mixture designated lp-bm5 murine leukemia virus
(mulv) develop immunosuppressive disease. quinolinic acid (quin) an
endogenous neurotoxic n-methyl-d-aspartate agonist may contribute the
pathogenesis hiv-associated neurologic disease. present study, the
levels quin brain blood measured mice infected lp-bm5 mulv
and compared uninfected mice mice infected the
nonpathogenic strain ecotropic mulv (helper component lp-bm5 mulv).
infection lp-bm5 mulv resulted progressive increases blood quin levels
beginning 2 weeks inoculation peaked 16 weeks postinfection. quin
levels also increased cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum. in
systemic tissues, quin levels increased lung, liver, spleen. in
contrast, infection ecotropic viral component lp-bm5 mulv mixture
was associated changes brain, blood, systemic tissue quin
levels, even though helper virus burdens comparable mice
infected lp-bm5 mulv. treatment lp-bm5 mulv-infected mice the
antiretroviral agent zidovudine (azidothymidine) significantly reduced blood 
brain quin levels association reductions viral load brain and
spleen. observations suggest elevated quin production not
attributable productive infection retrovirus per se occurs in
response agent agents, cytokines, produced host 
in response virus infection.
