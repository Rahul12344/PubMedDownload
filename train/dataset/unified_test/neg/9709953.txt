thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (tao) potentially severe autoimmune
disease, around orbit, usually accompanied graves' disease. 
the goal study develop serological indicator tao to
characterize expression human thyroid eye muscle tissue. thus, have
recloned full-length 1d-complementary dna assessed expression levels 
in 90 healthy diseased human thyroids. graves' patients suffering from
tao (n = 29) displayed significant, 2.1-fold increase 1d expression levels
(p = 0.029), compared normal controls (n = 9), assessed using the
mann-whitney u-test paired, nonnormally distributed samples. contrast, a
decrease 1d expression (to 40% control normal values) confined to
thyroid autonomy (n = 19, p = 0.032). diseased human thyroids,
including graves' thyroids patients suffering clinically overt tao 
(n = 9), 1d expression levels different healthy controls. 1d
gene expression demonstrated healthy (n = 10) diseased (n = 10)
eye muscle tissues. furthermore, recombinant protein derived from
baculovirus-infected sf9 insect cells purified nondenaturing and
denaturing conditions. nondenaturing conditions, molecular mass
of recombinant 1d determined 85 kda; denaturing isolation yielded the
expected 64-kda protein. autoantibodies denatured 1d protein not
detectable sera diseased healthy subjects. immunoreactivity 
85-kda, nondenatured protein, evaluated panel 222 different human sera,
showed 82% graves' patients suffering tao autoantibodies against
recombinant 1d, whereas 5% healthy controls positive for
antibodies 1d. taken together, results demonstrate high disease
sensitivity specificity recombinant, nondenatured 1d, distinguish
graves' disease without tao forms thyroid and/or eye
disease. prospective studies show whether autoantibodies 1d 
can also used prognosticator tao.
