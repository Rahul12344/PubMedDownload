aim: compare results liver stiffness measurements transient elastography
(te) obtained patients population used recently published
meta-analysis.
methods: single center cross-sectional study. consecutive patients
with chronic viral hepatitis scheduled liver biopsy outpatient ward of
our infectious diseases department enrolled. te carried using
fibroscan™ (echosens, paris, france). liver biopsy performed day 
as te, day case procedure. fibrosis staged according metavir
scoring system. diagnostic performance te assessed using receiver
operating characteristic (roc) curves area roc curve analysis.
results: two hundred fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria. six (2%) 
patients excluded due unreliable te measurements. thus, 246 (171 men 
75 women) patients analyzed. one hundred ninety-five (79.3%) patients
had chronic hepatitis c, 41 (16.7%) chronic hepatitis b, 10 (4.0%) were
coinfected human immunodeficiency virus. roc curve analysis identified
optimal cut-off value te high 6.9 kpa f ≥ 2; 7.9 kpa f ≥ 3; 9.6 
kpa f = 4 patients (n = 246), high 6.9 kpa f ≥ 2; 7.3
kpa f ≥ 3; 9.3 kpa f = 4 patients hepatitis c (n = 195). cut-off 
values te obtained maximizing specificity high 6.9 kpa 
for f ≥ 2; 9.6 kpa f ≥ 3; 12.2 kpa f = 4 patients (n = 246), and
as high 7.0 kpa f ≥ 2; 9.3 kpa f ≥ 3; 12.3 kpa f = 4 patients
with hepatitis c (n = 195).
conclusion: cut-off values te obtained single center study are
comparable obtained recently published meta-analysis included
up 40 studies.
