the frequency chromosome damage studied carriers virus the
hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome (puumala virus) noninfected animals 
from two laboratory colonies two natural populations bank vole. the
laboratory colony, puumala virus persisted three years, multiaberrant
("rogue") cells found bone marrow; mean frequencies both
structural numeral chromosome abnormalities significantly enhanced. in
the laboratory colony, puumala virus detected 30 years of
its existence, mean frequencies structural chromosome damage were
increased degree probably due prolonged breeding under
laboratory conditions, resulted suppression immunity dna repair. 
the voles natural populations resistant clastogenic
viral effect, also multiaberrant cells served indicators of
viral infection. data obtained support hypothesis viral infections
increase mutation rate, contributing thereby evolution process.
