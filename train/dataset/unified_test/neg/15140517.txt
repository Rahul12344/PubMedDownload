objective: test hypothesis p53 homozygous arg/arg genotype codon
72 significant risk factor development hpv induced cervical
cancer.
study design: cross-sectional survey p53 allelotypes distribution women
with different grade cervical lesions without hpv infection, in
comparison distribution control group women cytologically normal
and hpv negative.
results: statistically significant difference p53 polymorphism
distribution found relation infection hpv, cytological
pattern conditions. modest constant over-representation of
pro-allelotypes found groups comparison control group.
conclusion: searching p53 polymorphism clinical setting seem to
support secondary prevention procedures, least women area.
