pathogens sensed pattern recognition receptors (prrs), germ
line-encoded receptors, including transmembrane toll-like receptors (tlrs) and
cytosolic nucleotide oligomerisation domain (nod) proteins, containing
leucine-rich repeats (nlrs). activation prrs specific pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (pamps) results genomic responses host cells involving
activation transcription factors induction genes. at

signalling via interactions adaptor proteins including myd88 and
toll-receptor associated activator interferon (trif). nod signalling via
the inflammasome involves activation rip-like interactive clarp kinase
