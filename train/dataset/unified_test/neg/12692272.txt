glycoprotein (gd) herpes simplex virus type 1 type 1 membrane protein
in virus envelope binds receptor molecules cell surface and
which induces cell-cell fusion co-expressed gb, gh gl. chimeric
gd molecule membrane anchor cytoplasmic tail domains were
replaced analogous regions human cd8 molecule competent as
wild-type gd mediating membrane fusion virus entry. however, gd was
tethered membrane means glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchor 
sequence, binds outer leaflet lipid bilayer, was
unable function cell-cell fusion assays. chimera incorporated into
virions efficiently wild-type gd yet virus particles containing
gpi-linked gd entered cells slowly virions containing wild-type gd in
their envelopes, suggesting gd must anchored leaflets lipid 
bilayer function cell fusion virus entry.
