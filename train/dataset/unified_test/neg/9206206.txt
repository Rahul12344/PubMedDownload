in order study relationship hepatitis b virus dna (hbv dna),
hepatitis c virus rna (hcv rna) liver cell carcinoma, hbv dna hcv rna
from tumor tissue 42 liver cell carcinoma cases studied polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) nested-pcr respectively. results follows:
one case cholangiocarcinoma positive hbv dna hcv rna, one
case biliary cystadenoma positive hbv dna. among 40 cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), 29 positive hbv dna 13 positive 
hcv rna. relationship obtained hbv hcv infection 
histological types hcc, hcv infection hcc interrelated with
hbv. considered although hbv still leading cause hcc in
china, hcv may play important role hepatic carcinogenesis its
high positive rate increasing incidence.
