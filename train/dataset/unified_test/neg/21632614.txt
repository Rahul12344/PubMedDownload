emerging zoonoses threaten global health, yet processes emerge 
are complex poorly understood. nipah virus (niv) important threat owing
to broad host geographical range, high case fatality, potential for
human-to-human transmission lack effective prevention therapies. here, 
we investigate origin first identified outbreak niv encephalitis in
malaysia singapore. analyse data livestock production index
site (a commercial pig farm malaysia) prior outbreak, on
malaysian agricultural production, surveys niv's wildlife reservoir
(flying foxes). analyses suggest repeated introduction niv from
wildlife changed infection dynamics pigs. initial viral introduction produced 
an explosive epizootic drove extinction primed population 
for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction virus. resultant
within-farm persistence permitted regional spread increased number of
human infections. study refutes earlier hypothesis anomalous el ni√±o
southern oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence suggests
that priming persistence drove emergence novel zoonotic pathogen.
thus, provide empirical evidence causative mechanism previously proposed
as precursor widespread infection h5n1 avian influenza other
emerging pathogens.
