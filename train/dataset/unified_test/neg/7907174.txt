objective: zidovudine didanosine beneficial treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection children. disease
progression toxicity often limit long-term use single agents, new
approaches using nucleoside analogues necessary improve current
antiretroviral therapy.
design: conducted phase i-ii study evaluate tolerance,
pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity combination zidovudine and
didanosine children hiv infection. sixty-eight children either
previously untreated manifested hematologic toxicity full-dose
zidovudine enrolled. eight dose combinations studied previously 
untreated children, doses zidovudine ranging 90 180 mg/m2 every 6
hours doses didanosine ranging 90 180 mg/m2 every 12 hours.
results: fifty-four previously untreated hiv-infected children enrolled in
this part study, 49 remained study minimum 24
weeks. children previous zidovudine-related hematologic toxicity, three 
dose levels zidovudine 60 mg/m2 every 6 hours orally didanosine
ranging 90 180 mg/m2 every 12 hours orally used. total 14
children enrolled part study, 12 remained therapy 
at least 24 weeks. evidence new enhanced toxicity observed either
group. 24 weeks, median cd4 cell count patients increased 
331 556 cells/mm3 (p = .01). previously untreated group, median
increase cd4 counts 386 726 cells/mm3 (p = .003). median p24
antigen concentration (in detectable level baseline) decreased
from 95 < 31 pg/ml (p < .001). geometric mean titer hiv plasma
decreased 83.1 2.7 tissue culture infectious doses/ml (p = .001).
conclusions: combination zidovudine didanosine well-tolerated at
doses high used single agent therapy. potent vivo antiviral
activity observed. combination therapy nucleoside analogues may an
important approach optimizing use agents treatment hiv 
infection.
