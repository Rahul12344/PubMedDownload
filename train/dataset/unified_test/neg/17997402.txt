members gamma2-herpesvirus family encode cyclin-like proteins have
the ability deregulate mammalian cell cycle control. report key
features viral cyclin encoded murine herpesvirus 68, cyclin. cyclin
preferentially associated activated cdk2; cyclin/cdk2 holoenzyme
displayed strong reliance phosphorylation cdk loop activity.
cdk2 associated cyclin exhibited substantial resistance cdk
inhibitor proteins p21(cip) p27(kip). furthermore, cyclin directed cdk2 
phosphorylate p27(kip1) threonine 187 (t187) cellular expression m
cyclin led down-regulation p27(kip1) partial subversion the
associated g1 arrest. mutation t187 non-phosphorylatable alanine rendered
the p27(kip1)-imposed g1 arrest resistant cyclin expression. unlike the
related k cyclin, cyclin unable circumvent g1 arrest associated with
p21(cip1) unable direct associated catalytic subunit to
phosphorylate cdk inhibitor. results imply cyclin has
properties distinct viral cyclins cyclin
expression alone insufficient phase entry.
