although etiology multiple sclerosis (ms) unknown, generally
believed genetic, immunologic, environmental factors involved. the
objectives study were: 1. analyze genetic control could explain
why hhv-6 would able actively replicate subset ms patients 
in controls; 2. study ms patients hhv-6 active replication are
clinically different without hhv-6 active replication. total 195 
ms patients 195 controls analyzed two snps mhc2ta locus and
two snps cd46 locus. furthermore, ms cohort analyzed pcr for
the detection hhv-6 genomes five serum samples collected every six months
along two-year follow-up. found 59/195 (30.2%) ms patients least
one hhv-6 positive serum sample. statistical significant difference found 
for two genes comparison made ms patients controls; 
however, statistical significance found two polymorphisms mhc2ta
when compared ms patients active replication controls (p=0.0000004
for rs4774c p=0.011 rs3087456g). furthermore, increased significant
differences found mhc2ta cd46 compared interferon beta
responders non-responders within ms patients. conclusion, describe a
gene-environment interaction ms patients hhv-6 mhc2ta cd46
that studied clarify interaction could genetic 
control. results show ms patients without hhv-6 active replication are
better responders interferon beta treatment hhv-6 active
replication.
