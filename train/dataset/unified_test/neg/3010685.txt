cytomegalic inclusion virus encephalitis patients aids: ct, clinical, and
pathologic correlation.

post mj, hensley gt, moskowitz lb, fischl m.

the computed tomographic (ct) scans 10 patients acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome central nervous system (cns) involvement cytomegalovirus
(cmv) retrospectively reviewed correlated clinical data and
pathologic findings. diagnosis established 10 patients autopsy,
which showed pathognomonic "owl's eye" intracellular inclusions cmv. in
six patients cmv caused initial cns infection directly responsible
for patient's progressive encephalopathy death. four patients cmv
caused superimposed nondominant cns infection clinical expression
in two. cortical atrophy mild hydrocephalus ex vacuo seen ct all
10 patients. positive findings ct could attributed infection with
cmv present three 10 patients, three symptomatic
cases autopsy correlation revealed ct underestimated degree cns
involvement. three symptomatic patients, ct showed parenchymal
abnormalities, autopsy demonstrated diffuse cerebral involvement. the
four patients whose cns secondarily involved cmv, ct showed changes proven
at autopsy related dominant infection toxoplasma gondii
and postoperative hematomas. ct demonstrate abnormalities the
sites cmv involvement, found autopsy latter group. it
was concluded ct sensitive detection cmv
encephalitis.
