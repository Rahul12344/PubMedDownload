powdery mildew one devastating diseases wheat. date, few
powdery mildew resistance genes cloned wheat due size and
complexity wheat genome. triticum urartu progenitor genome
of wheat important source powdery mildew resistance genes. using
molecular markers designed scaffolds sequenced t. urartu accession
and standard map-based cloning, powdery mildew resistance locus mapped a
356-kb region, contains two nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat
domain (nb-lrr) protein-encoding genes. virus-induced gene silencing, single-cell
transient expression, stable transformation assays demonstrated one of
these two genes, designated pm60, confers resistance powdery mildew.
overexpression full-length pm60 two allelic variants nicotiana
benthamiana leaves induced hypersensitive cell death response, expression 
the coiled-coil domain alone insufficient induce hypersensitive response. 
yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation luciferase
complementation imaging assays showed pm60 protein interacts its
neighboring nb-containing protein, suggesting might functionally
related. identification cloning novel wheat powdery mildew
resistance gene facilitate breeding disease resistance wheat.
