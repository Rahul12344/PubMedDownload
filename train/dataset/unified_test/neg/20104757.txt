objective: assess relationship level serum tnf-alpha of
chronic hepatitis c severity disease curative effect anti-virus
therapy interferon alpha.
methods: thirty healthy controls 102 patients chronic hepatitis c were
recruited study. level serum tnf-alpha determined elisa
in groups. 102 patients chronic hepatitis c evaluated
after classified mild (44 cases), moderate (34 cases), severe
types (24 cases) based results liver function tests. liver functions,
viral load genotype hcv rna measured.
results: anti-virus treatment, level fasting serum tnf-alpha the
patients chronic hepatitis c (1) higher normal
controls; (2) cases mild type lower moderate and
severe groups; (3) serum tnf-alpha associated hcv load; (4)
serum tnf-alpha significantly different hcv subtypes 1b 2a;
(5) serum tnf-alpha significantly different patients
responsive non-responsive anti-virus treatment; (6) serum tnf-alpha
was positively correlated level serum direct bilirubin, negatively
correlated cholinesterase (che).
conclusions: level fasting serum tnf-alpha patients chronic
hepatitis higher normal controls, positively
correlated severity disease correlated the
therapeutic effect interferon-alpha.
