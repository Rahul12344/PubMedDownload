a total 152 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains isolated from
clinical samples 14 patients hospitalized bone-marrow transplantation in
a specialized hospital ward hungary, 18-month period 1987
and 1989. two species, staphylococcus epidermidis staphylococcus
haemolyticus, predominated (each, 45%). using pulverer co-workers' phage set 
for typing, 68% isolates typable; 16 phage patterns observed. 
characteristic long pattern phages ph10/ph13/ph15/u4/u15/u16/u20/u33 /u46
appeared s. epidermidis, among 5 11 colonized patients (8.5% all
strains). single lysis phage ph13 observed 7 14 patients (49% 
of strains), species s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s.
hominis, s. warneri. s. haemolyticus, non-typable strains predominated
(66%); character occurred 2% among species. strains
colonizing immunocompromised patients differed phage
pattern, antibiotic resistance pattern, and/or slime production. hospital
infection suggested. hand, high incidence two well-definable 
phage patterns raises relationship phage receptors some
regulatory systems phage multiplication factors responsible special
