endothelial cells (ec) play key role propagation inflammatory
responses. better understanding inflammatory processes ec might provide new
ways controlling inflammation. report known antioxidant
pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (pdtc) leads time dose dependent activation 
heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) well hsp32 ec. demonstrate that
pdtc activates heat-shock factor 1 (hsf1), one several transcription factor
involved upregulation heat-shock proteins. importantly, we
demonstrate hsp32 well hsp70 upregulated independently the
transcription factor nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab). presented data
provide insight mechanism hsp32 hsp70 regulation, well
as distinguishing genes called 'protective genes'
whose upregulation depends activation nf-kappab. findings
indicate hsp32 hsp70 might ideal candidates among protective genes.
hsp32 hsp70 provide many desirable protective effects but, independent 
of nf-kappab, would leave open option interfere upregulation of
proinflammatory genes modulating activation nf-kappab.
