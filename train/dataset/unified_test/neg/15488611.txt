natural killer (nk) cells represent important early effector cells innate
immune defense exert functions without prior sensitization. they
participate regulation innate adaptive immune responses and
hematopoiesis producing various cytokines chemokines. addition, nk
cells lyse virally infected malignant cells raising multifunctional
members first line defense. unlike lymphocytes lack specific
antigen receptors. rather bind cells using ubiquitous molecules and
communicate via pattern receptors specific mhc-i molecules their
counterparts. general, successful binding receptors delivers an
inhibitory signal nk cells thus sparing target cell lysis. in
contrast, down-regulated altered mhc-i expression frequently observed
during virus infection malignant cells prevents ligation inhibitory
receptors mhc-i paralyzing inhibition thus inducing lysis target
cell. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection nk cells central
importance since combat viral infection opportunistic
pathogens like fungi protozoa usually spread course hiv
infection. however, various studies reported alterations hiv patients
affecting nk cell numbers functions might negatively influence course
and severity disease. review focus mutual interference of
nk cells hi virus.
