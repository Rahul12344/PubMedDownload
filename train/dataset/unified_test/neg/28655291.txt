canid alphaherpesvirus 1 (chv) causes morbidity mortality susceptible
puppies. neuropathology experimentally infected puppies been
detailed, characterization naturally acquired infections limited. aim
of study describe histologic, immunohistochemical, situ
hybridization features chv encephalitis dog. six female 11 male
puppies ranging age stillborn 57 days old included.
histologically, lesions included multifocal glial nodules (16/17, 94%), meningeal
infiltrates (15/17, 88%), cerebellar cortical necrosis (6/9, 67%); however,
robust inflammation significant feature cases.
immunohistochemistry cd3, cd20, mac387, iba1 performed. although t
cells predominated b cells, overall number cells small all
cases within glial nodules meninges. 16 16 (100%) cases,
glial nodules diffusely immunoreactive iba1; however, limited no
immunoreactivity mac387 present. situ hybridization directed the
chv thymidine kinase gene revealed chv nucleic acid granule neurons the
cerebellar folia (8/9; 89%), endothelial cells meninges parenchyma
(12/17, 71%), individual randomly distributed neurons (6/17, 35%). these
results clarify pathology naturally acquired chv infection indicate
that developing cerebellar granule neurons important site viral
replication.
