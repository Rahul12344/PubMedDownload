this study reports effects tgf beta secretion ig isotypes 
highly purified (> 99% cd20-positive) human peripheral blood b cells. stimulation
of b cell preparations ebv resulted secretion igm, igg, 
iga addition il-4 induced readily detectable levels (> 100 ng/ml) of
ige 10 25 days culture. tgf beta 1 tgf beta 2 showed similar
dose-dependent suppression igm, igg, iga, relative proportion of
igg iga remained unchanged presence tgf beta. ige production
induced ebv il-4 significantly inhibited tgf beta. tgf beta effects
on ig secretion related inhibition b cell proliferation this
cytokine. contrast tgf beta effects ebv activation primary b
cells, constitutive ig secretion ebv-transformed b cells resistant 
tgf beta, increase ig secretion induced il-6 inhibited tgf
beta. thus, tgf beta inhibits ebv-induced secretion major ig isotypes 
in peripheral blood b cells differential effects ig secretion by
transformed b cells.
