the hiv-1 genetic variability bahia state, brazil, investigated. dna
samples 229 213 hiv-1-infected individuals analyzed using the
heteroduplex mobility assay (hma) gag env fragments, respectively. one
hundred seventy-five samples characterized genes. thirty-two subtype
f bf recombinant viruses sequenced analyzed phylogenetic methods.
the combination hma sequencing results showed seven different hiv-1
genotypes comprised sample: 147 (84%) b/b, 4 (2.3%) f/f, 3 (1.7%) b/f, 1
(0.6%) f/b, 1 (0.6%) f/d, 1 (0.6%) bf/f, 18 (10.3%) bf/b. significant
divergence observed two techniques results (84.4%). is
explained low accuracy hma detecting recombinant viruses. these
recombinants unrelated crf12, two sequences related crf28
and crf29. nineteen bf mosaics shared gag breakpoint. conclusion, the
use hma may inappropriate regions different subtypes are
co-circulating. subtype b common genotype, however, increased
prevalence (13.1%) different bf variants potentially new crf suggest
that recombination occurring frequently bahia. viruses were
associated women infected heterosexually. finally, study identified the
presence f/d recombinant hiv-1 brazil.
