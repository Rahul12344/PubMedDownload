the epstein-barr virus (ebv) one infectious agents found stomach
tissue. recently, ebv-associated gastric carcinoma (ebvagc) classified a
new subtype gastric carcinoma. date, lack knowledge the
distribution prevalence ebv infection normal stomach and
various gastric lesions, including ebvagc, thai population. study,
we detected ebv normal stomach (ns; n = 19), chronic gastritis (cg;
n = 36), intestinal metaplasia (im; n = 40), gastric dysplasia (gd; n = 15), 
gastric adenocarcinoma (gc; n = 33) polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
amplification latent membrane protein (lmp1) gene ebv. ebv-pcr
amplification positive 42.1%, 36.1%, 22.5%, 13.3%, 33.3% ns, cg,
im, gd, gc, respectively. clarification ebvagc, performed
ebv-encoded small rna situ hybridization (eber-ish) pcr-positive cases of
gd gc. four gc cases eber-ish positive (12.1%), gd cases were
eber-ish negative. addition, determined distribution ebv strain 
(type b) based ebna3c sequence ebv variants based lmp1 variation
(wild-type 30-bp deletion variants; wt-lmp1 del-lmp1). results showed 
that type wt-lmp1 prevalent lesions. conclusion,
ebv common ns gastric lesions, frequency ebvagc was
12.1% thai patients.
