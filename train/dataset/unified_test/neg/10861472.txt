transgenic fvb-neun mice (n202) bearing rat neu protooncogene driven the
mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/enhancer develop focal mammary carcinomas
overexpressing neu-encoded p185(neu) protein. vitro expression of
p185(neu) among mammary carcinoma cultures heterogeneous, could
establish cell lines clones displaying complete loss p185(neu)
expression, along others high p185(neu) protein level. upon in
vivo injection, p185(neu)-positive cells gave rise fast-growing tumors 
short latency, p185(neu)-negative cells required long latency time, 
and resulting tumors invariably p185(neu)-positive. lower growth
ability p185(neu)-negative cells vivo also confirmed athymic nude
mice. vitro, analysis anchorage-independent growth soft agar revealed
colony formation p185(neu)-positive p185(neu)-negative cells. the
direct involvement p185(neu) clonogenicity demonstrated the
inhibition p185(neu)-positive colony growth soft agar presence an
anti-p185(neu) monoclonal antibody. contrast, higher level of
anchorage-dependent clonogenic growth proliferation observed in
p185(neu)-negative cells compared p185(neu)-positive cells, thus explaining
the relative ease p185(neu)-negative cell lines clones were
established vitro. together, results indicate p185(neu) expression
can lead tumor formation metastasis modification intrinsic 
properties cells related anchorage-independent growth ability rather than
to proliferation host-dependent mechanisms.
