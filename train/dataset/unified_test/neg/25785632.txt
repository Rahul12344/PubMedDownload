the capacity achieve rapid, sensitive, specific, quantitative, multiplexed
genetic detection pathogens via robust, portable, point-of-care platform
could transform many diagnostic applications. contemporary technologies
have yet effectively achieve goal, advent microfluidics provides a
potentially viable approach end enabling integration of
sophisticated multistep biochemical assays (e.g., sample preparation, genetic
amplification, quantitative detection) monolithic, portable device 
relatively small biological samples. integrated electrochemical sensors offer a
particularly promising solution genetic detection require 
optical instrumentation readily compatible integrated circuit
and microfluidic technologies. nevertheless, development generalizable
microfluidic electrochemical platforms integrate sample preparation and
amplification well quantitative multiplexed detection remains a
challenging unsolved technical problem. recognizing unmet need, 
developed series microfluidic electrochemical dna sensors have
progressively evolved encompass critical functionalities. for
dna detection, platforms employ label-free, single-step, and
sequence-specific electrochemical dna (e-dna) sensors, an
electrode-bound, redox-reporter-modified dna "probe" generates current change
after undergoing hybridization-induced conformational change. after
successfully integrating e-dna sensors microfluidic chip format, we
subsequently incorporated on-chip genetic amplification techniques including
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp)
to enable genetic detection clinically relevant target concentrations. to
maximize potential point-of-care utility platforms, further
integrated sample preparation via immunomagnetic separation, allowed the
detection influenza virus directly throat swabs developed strategies 
for multiplexed detection related bacterial strains blood of
septic mice. finally, developed alternative electrochemical detection
platform based real-time lamp, capable detecting across a
broad dynamic range target concentrations, also greatly simplifies
quantitative measurement nucleic acids. efforts represent considerable
progress toward development true sample-in-answer-out platform for
genetic detection pathogens point care. given many advantages of
these systems, growing interest innovative contributions from
researchers field, optimistic iterations systems
will arrive clinical settings foreseeable future.
