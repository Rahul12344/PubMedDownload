mutations negatively positively affect fusion properties murine
leukemia viruses (mlvs) found within subdomains su
(surface) tm (transmembrane) envelope units. yet, interrelations 
these different regions envelope complex cell entry process are
still elusive. deletion histidine residue conserved phqv motif at
the amino terminus amphotropic ecotropic mlv su resulted the
adelh modelh fusion-defective mutant envelope, respectively. delh
mutant envelopes incorporated retroviral particles normal densities and
normally mediate virion binding cells expressing retroviral receptors.
however, cell-cell virus-cell fusogenicities fully prevented 
at early postbinding stage. show fusion defect adelh or
modelh envelopes also almost completely reverted providing either soluble 
su polypeptide encompassing receptor-binding domain (rbd) target 
cells, provided integrity amino-terminal end either
polypeptide preserved. restoration delh envelope fusogenicity caused
by activation target cells via specific interaction latter
polypeptides retrovirus receptor rather association with
the delh envelope complexes. moreover crossactivation target cells,
leading fusion activation adelh modelh envelopes, achieved by
polypeptides containing various type c mammalian retrovirus rbds, irrespective of
the type entry-defective glycoprotein used infection. results
