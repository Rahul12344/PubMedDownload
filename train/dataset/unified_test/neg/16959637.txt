recent avian flu epidemics (a/h5n1) southeast asia case reports from
around world led fears human pandemic. control these
outbreaks birds would probably lead reduced transmission avian virus
to humans. study presents mathematical model based stochastic
farm-to-farm transmission incorporates flock size spatial contacts to
evaluate impact control strategies. fit data recent epidemic
in netherlands, evaluate efficacy control strategies forecast
avian influenza dynamics. results identify high-risk areas spread by
mapping farm level reproductive number. results suggest immediate 
depopulation infected flocks following accurate quick diagnosis would
have greater impact simply depopulating surrounding flocks. understanding 
the relative importance different control measures essential response
planning.
