as axons grow past intermediate targets, change responsiveness to
guidance cues. local upregulation receptor expression involved, the
mechanisms clear. protein synthesis traced within
individual axons introducing rnas encoding visualizable reporters. individual 
severed axons growth cones translate proteins also export the
cell surface. axons reach spinal cord midline, epha2 among the
receptors upregulated least distal axon segments. midline reporter
upregulation recapitulated part epha2 mrna 3' untranslated region,
which highly conserved includes known translational control sequences.
these results show axons contain machinery protein translation and
cell surface expression, reveal potentially general flexible
rna-based mechanism regulation localized within subregion axon.
