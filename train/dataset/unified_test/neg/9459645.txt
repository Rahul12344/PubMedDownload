each visit, collected information lifestyle sexual behavior and
obtained cervicovaginal-lavage samples detection hpv dna polymerase
chain reaction southern blot hybridization. pap smears obtained
annually.
results: cumulative 36-month incidence hpv infection 43 percent (95

infection significantly associated younger age, hispanic ethnicity,
black race, increased number vaginal-sex partners, high frequencies of
vaginal sex alcohol consumption, anal sex, certain characteristics of
partners (regular partners increased number lifetime partners and

percent confidence interval, 7 10 months). persistence hpv > =6 
months related older age, types hpv associated cervical cancer,
and infection multiple types hpv smoking. risk an
abnormal pap smear increased persistent hpv infection, particularly with
high-risk types (relative risk, 37.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 14.6 to
94.8).
conclusions: incidence hpv infection sexually active young college
women high. short duration hpv infections women suggests 
that associated cervical dysplasia managed conservatively.
