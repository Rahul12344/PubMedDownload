antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies useful tools detect small
amounts antigenic materials applicable antibody therapeutics. to
produce mouse monoclonal antibodies, hybridoma b lymphocytes and
myeloma cells used produce antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. however,
a good hybridoma system available obtain human monoclonal antibodies.
to produce antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies, transformation b
lymphocytes epstein-barr viruses phage-display system used. here, we
describe screening antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cells using
microwell array chips obtain antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies. the
system applied screen antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cells from
any animal species.
