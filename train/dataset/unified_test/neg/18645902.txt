the nucleotide sequence haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (hn) glycoprotein
gene newcastle disease virus (ndv) variant strain v4(upm) determined by
direct genomic rna sequencing confirmed cycle sequencing. gene
comprises 1996 nucleotides encoding 615 amino acid protein size 67.4 kda.
the nucleotide amino acid sequences strain compared those
of parent strain v4(que). 16 nucleotide substitutions v4(upm),
eight silent mutations another eliminated potential asn-linked
glycosylation site v4(upm). addition, arg (403) residue shown 
absent variant strain. deletion thought significant 
of location highly conserved region hn protein.
