recombinant adenoviruses, poxviruses, plasmid dna vaccines encoding different
hepatitis b virus (hbv)/murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) protein chimeras used 
to immunize mice. processing chimeras resulted presentation a
protective ld/cd8+ t-cell epitope immediate early 1 protein pp89 (ie1
pp89) mcmv immune system. different levels immunogenicity were
observed depending on: (i) type viral vector used, (ii) whether the
antigens included cellular secretion pathway, (iii) location 
of protective epitope within chimeric protein. adenovirus expressing a
secretory hbv core protein mcmv epitope c-terminus induced the
highest immune response. immunogenic adenovirus vaccinia virus 
were used heterologous prime-boost immunization protocol, even higher levels
of epitope-specific cells obtained. furthermore, responses protective
against challenge mcmv, inducing 96% reduction viral load in
immunized animals, determined sensitive real-time pcr assay. together,
these results confirmed previous observations efficient use adenoviral 
and poxviral vectors prime-boost protocols immunization diseases
whose resolution depends cellular immunity, well aptness of
correctly designed chimeric carrier proteins facilitate goal.
