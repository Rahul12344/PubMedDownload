this study designed understand effects interspecific
competition red imported fire ant, solenopsis invicta buren two
native ant species, pheidole fervens smith monomorium chinense santschi, by
conducting colony interference individual confrontation tests under
laboratory conditions. colony interference test showed native ant
species, owing numerical advantage, killed solenopsis invicta
virus-1 (sinv-1)-infected healthy queens s. invicta. significantly less
time required m. chinense kill sinv-1-infected s. invicta compared
with time required kill healthy s. invicta. compared healthy s.
invicta, sinv-1-infected s. invicta spent longer time eliminating p.
fervens colonies. confrontation tests, m. chinense killed significantly
higher number infected s. invicta minors healthy minors, the
number s. invicta majors (either infected healthy) killed substantially
less. study found viral infection weakened competitive ability 
of s. invicta made prone eliminated m. chinense p.
fervens.
