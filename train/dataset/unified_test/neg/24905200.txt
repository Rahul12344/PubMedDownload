adenosine deaminase acting rna1 (adar1) catalyzes c6 deamination of
adenosine (a) produce inosine (i) regions rna double-stranded (ds) 
character. process known a-to-i rna editing. alternative promoters
drive expression adar1 gene alternative splicing gives rise to
transcripts encode 2 adar1 protein size isoforms. adar1 p150 an
interferon (ifn)-inducible dsrna adenosine deaminase found cytoplasm and
nucleus, whereas adar1 p110 constitutively expressed nuclear in
localization. dependent duplex structure dsrna substrate,
deamination adenosine adar either highly site-selective or
nonspecific. a-to-i editing alter stability rna structures the
coding rna read g instead ribosomes mrna translation
and polymerases rna replication. a-to-i editing broad physiologic
significance. production action ifns, hence the
subsequent interaction viruses hosts, among processes
affected a-to-i editing.
