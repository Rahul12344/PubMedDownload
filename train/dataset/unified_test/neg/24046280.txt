rna viruses represent predominant cause many clinically relevant viral
diseases humans. among several evolutionary advantages acquired rna
viruses, ability usurp host cellular machinery evade antiviral immune 
responses imperative. past decade, rna interference mechanisms,
especially microrna (mirna)-mediated regulation cellular protein expression,
have revolutionized understanding host-viral interactions. although 
well established several dna viruses express mirnas play crucial roles 
in pathogenesis, expression mirnas rna viruses remains controversial.
however, modulation mirna machinery rna viruses may confer multiple
benefits enhanced viral replication survival host cells. this
review, discuss current literature rna viruses may encode mirnas
and varied advantages engineering rna viruses express mirnas as
potential vectors gene therapy. addition, review different families
of rna viruses alter mirna machinery productive replication, evasion of
antiviral immune responses, prolonged survival. underscore need to
further explore complex interactions rna viruses host mirnas to
augment understanding host-virus interplay.
