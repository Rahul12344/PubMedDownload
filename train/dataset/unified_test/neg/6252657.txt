recent developments biochemistry, immunology organic chemistry suggest two
new methods producing vaccines. new procedures may perhaps be
adopted future, described. shown that, case foot- 
mouth disease, viral protein 1 (vp1) rather complete virus may used
in vaccine. protein could produced genetic manipulation. the
isolated antigenic site responsible inducing neutralizing anti-bodies might
also utilized vaccine. antigenic site probably any
longer ten amino acids, may produced organic chemical synthesis once
its sequence known. case vp1 antigenic site,
the immunogenities products increased vp1 less
immunogenic comparable amount complete virus, whereas antigenic
site presumably immunogenic all. new vaccines safer and
possibly cheaper produce classical ones are. moreover vaccines
against viral diseases could produced, cannot obtained classical
methods.
