enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), complement fixation test (cft) for
detection avian leukosis/sarcoma virus (alv) group-specific (gs) antigens 
the phenotypic mixing test (pmt) compare applicability techniques
for identification hens congenitally excrete exogenous alv. the
predictive value test evaluated basis association between

demonstrable hens. materials two flocks study close
correlation observed congenital transmission exogenous alv to
embryos alv gs-antigen detection albumen samples. results examinations 
of vaginal/cloaca swabs meconium samples poorly associated with
congenital virus excretion. alv gs-antigen levels generally higher in
embryos albumen samples. considerable variations gs-antigen levels
were observed embryos albumen samples eggs individual alv shedding
hens also within series embryos eggs one hen.
