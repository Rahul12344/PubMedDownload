embryonic chick cells primitive streak stage later stages the
developing embryo infected avian erythroblastosis virus (aev). data
indicate greatest number target cells aev observed the
12-somite blastoderm gradually decreased hemopoietic tissues the
development embryo. target cell aev bfu-e
compartment, adult bone marrow, probably recruited within 
the cfu-m compartment precedes bfu-e compartment. studies also show
that significant number transformed colonies derived embryonic
hemopoietic tissues undergo hemoglobinization contrast observed
in transformed colonies bone marrow. complete characterization the
embryonic adult hemoglobin present study.
