objective: acute gastroenteritis (age) risk factor post-infectious
irritable bowel syndrome (pi-ibs). systematic review evaluates the
prevalence risk-factors pi-ibs age specific pathogens. materials 
and methods: medline (1966-2019) embase (1974-2019) searched studies
evaluating pi-ibs minimum 3 months age campylobacter spp., salmonella 
spp., shigella spp., escherischia coli, clostridium difficile, norovirus,
rotavirus, cryptosporidium spp. giardia intestinalis using validated criteria 
for ibs. pooled prevalence (pp), odds ratios (or) risk factors were
determined single pathogens, groups bacteria, viruses parasites, and
overall age caused pathogen. random-effect models used for
meta-analyses. results: total 34 articles included. pp pi-ibs 
campylobacter spp. 12% (confidence interval 95% [ci]: 10-15%), salmonellosis 
12% (ci: 9-15%), shigellosis 11% (ci: 8-15%), c. difficile 14% (ci: 4-29%) e.
coli spp. 12% (ci: 5-20%). pi-ibs salmonellosis 5.5 (ci:
2.3-12.8) shigellosis 13.8 (ci: 4.2-45.4). bacterial age overall showed
or 5.8 (ci: 4.0-8.3) age caused pathogen 4.9 (ci: 3.9-6.1). few
studies exist viral parasitic gastroenteritis. conclusions: current
literature show similar risks bacterial pathogens. studies limited for
viral parasitic pathogens. evaluated risk-factors pi-ibs varied among
the included studies existing evidence insufficient identify
pathogen-specific risk factors.
