background: purpose study analyze serologic molecular
markers gb virus type c/hepatitis g virus (gbv-c/hgv) infection in
voluntary blood donors southeastern france.
study design methods: sera tested presence gbv-c/hgv rna by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction antibodies the
gbv-c/hgv e2 (anti-e2) antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. first
cohort (1660 blood donors) tested prospectively second cohort (238
samples hepatitis markers) tested retrospectively. donors the
prospective study questioned possible risk factors virus
transmission. amplification products sequenced subjected phylogenetic
analysis.
results: approximately 2.6 percent individuals accepted blood donation and
15.4 percent positive hepatitis c virus serologic tests carried gbv-c/hgv
rna. anti-e2 detected two populations approximately 12 percent
and 48 percent donors, respectively. moderate relative risks found only
in tattooed pierced individuals (1.82) health care workers (2.45). almost 
all strains located phylogenetic branch hgv group 2.
conclusion: though large proportion donors tested contact
with gbv-c/hgv, elevated relative risk infection identified. the
phylogenetic distribution viral strains suggests infection endemic
in population.
