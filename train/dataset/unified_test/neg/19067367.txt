objective: two recent analyses found exposure protease inhibitors (pis)
in context antiretroviral (arv) therapy increased risk distal
sensory polyneuropathy (dspn) subjects human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
infection. findings supported vitro model pi
exposure produced neurite retraction process loss dorsal root ganglion
sensory neurons. confirmation peripheral nerve toxicity pis could
substantially limit long-term use highly active arv therapy.
methods: evaluated current past exposure pis risk factor dspn 
in 1,159 hiv-infected individuals enrolled large, prospective,
observational, multicenter study. signs dspn ascertained neurological 
examination. subjects grouped categories according past current 
exposure arv pis. included disease indicators nadir cd4,
plasma viral load, duration hiv infection, well advancing age and
exposure dideoxynucleoside arvs multivariate models.
results: univariate analyses, past current pi exposure significantly 
increased risk dspn. however, adjusting previously validated
concomitant risk factors multivariate models, none pi exposure groups
was likely dspn arv naive subjects. secondary evaluation of
duration pi use exposure individual pi drugs similarly
nonsignificant multivariate models, except small effects amprenavir and
lopinavir.
interpretation: evaluation concomitant risks hiv dspn suggests the
independent risk attributable pis, any, small. risk must weighed
against important role pis modern arv therapy regimens.
