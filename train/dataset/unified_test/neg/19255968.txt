we report case kaposi's sarcoma patient received double kidney
transplant 2005. immunosuppression induced rapamycin and
antilymphocyte serum maintenance therapy consisted rapamycin,
corticosteroids mycophenolic acid. patient developed delayed graft
function rejection. november 2006 march 2007 two graft biopsies
were taken significant rise serum creatinine; revealed
chronic allograft nephropathy polyomavirus infection. meanwhile skin biopsy
of leg performed determine nature discolored lesion. the
morphohistological diagnosis kaposi's sarcoma. reason rapamycin 
stopped steroid treatment gradually reduced. specific therapy with
doxorubicin started; radiological endoscopic examination excluded
disseminated disease serological tests positive antibodies to
hhv-8, virus known cause kaposi's sarcoma. unfortunately, withdrawal of
antirejection therapy caused loss graft, patient start
dialysis. report stress possible development malignancy in
transplanted patients given rapamycin. rapamycin known an
antirejection drug antineoplastic activity; major risk of
malignancy probably related immunosuppression rather type drugs
used obtain it.
