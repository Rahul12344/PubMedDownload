many diseases cause liver failure may recur transplantation. a
retrospective analysis rate cause graft loss 1840 consecutive
adults receiving primary liver transplant 1982 2004 performed
to evaluate rate graft loss disease recurrence. risk graft
loss recurrent disease greatest, compared primary biliary
cirrhosis (pbc), transplanted hepatitis c virus (hcv) [hazard ratio 
(hr) 11.6; 95% confidence interval (ci) 5.1-26.6], primary sclerosing cholangitis
(psc) (hr 6.0; 95% ci 2.5-14.2) autoimmune hepatitis (aih) (hr 4.1; 95% ci
1.3-12.6). overall risk graft loss also significantly greater hcv
(hr 2.1 vs. pbc; 95% ci 1.5-3.0), psc (hr 1.6 vs. pbc; 95% ci 1.2-2.3) aih
(hr 1.6; 95% ci 1.0-2.4) pbc. statistically significant
difference risk graft loss recurrent disease, compared 
with pbc, patients transplanted alcohol related liver disease,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis fulminant hepatic failure. disease recurrence is
a significant cause graft loss particularly hcv, psc aih. recurrent
disease, part, explains increased overall risk graft loss these
groups.
