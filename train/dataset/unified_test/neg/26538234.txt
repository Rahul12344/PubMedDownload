most guidelines suggest combination therapy including nucleoside nucleotide
analogues treatment chronic hepatitis b (chb) multidrug
resistance (md-r). however, long-term combination treatment evoke high costs 
and safety problems. therefore, investigated efficacy tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (tdf) mono-rescue therapy viral suppression patients
with chb exhibiting md-r. reviewed patients chb exhibiting antiviral drug
resistance treated tdf mono-rescue therapy december 2012 june 2014.
the patients categorized three groups: lamivudine-resistance (lam-r)
group (n = 290), lam-r + adefovir-resistance (adv-r) group (n = 43), and
lam-r + entecavir-resistance (etv-r) group (n = 113). compared virologic
response rate according multiplicity resistance investigated the
predictive factors virologic response. median 15 months (range,
6-24 months) tdf mono-rescue therapy, cumulative virologic response rates 
were 82.8, 81.4, 84.1% lam-r, lam-r + adv-r, lam-r + etv-r groups,
respectively (p = 0.239). multivariate analysis revealed multiplicity of
resistance influence achievement virologic response (p = 0.218).
however, baseline hbv dna level significantly influenced achievement a
virologic response treatment chb md-r (p < 0.001). tdf
mono-rescue therapy appropriate treatment chb md-r, the
baseline hbv dna level significant predictive factor virologic
response. factors considered treating chb md-r.
