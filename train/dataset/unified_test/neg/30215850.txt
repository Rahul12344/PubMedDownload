liver regeneration injury normally mediated proliferation of
hepatocytes, although recent studies suggested biliary epithelial cells
(becs) differentiate hepatocytes severe liver injury when
hepatocyte proliferation impaired. investigated effect of
hepatocyte-specific β-catenin deletion recovery severe liver injury and
bec-to-hepatocyte differentiation. induce liver injury, administered
choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (cde) diet three different mouse
models, first mice deletion β-catenin becs and
hepatocytes (albumin-cre; ctnnb1flox/flox mice). second model, we
performed hepatocyte lineage tracing injecting ctnnb1flox/flox ;
rosa-stopflox/flox -eyfp mice adeno-associated virus serotype 8 encoding
cre recombinase control thyroid binding globulin promoter, a
virus infects hepatocytes. finally, performed bec lineage tracing
via krt19-creert ; rosa-stopflox/flox -tdtomato mice. observe
bec-to-hepatocyte differentiation, mice allowed recover normal diet
following cde diet-induced liver injury. livers collected mice 
analyzed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting,
immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence. show mice lack of
β-catenin hepatocytes placed cde diet develop severe liver injury 
impaired hepatocyte proliferation, creating stimulus becs differentiate 
into hepatocytes. particular, use hepatocyte bec lineage tracing
to show becs differentiate hepatocytes, go repopulate the
liver long-term recovery. conclusion: β-catenin important liver
regeneration cde diet-induced liver injury, bec-derived hepatocytes can
permanently incorporate liver parenchyma mediate liver regeneration.
