the cell line riri-px1 established neonate larval tissues papilio
xuthus performing primary cultures modified grace medium was
supplemented 20% fetal bovine serum (fbs). cell line primarily consisted
of spindle-shaped spherical cells attached flask. the
population-doubling times (pdts) 50th 60th passage 42.5 h and
42.1 h respectively. average chromosome numbers riri-px1 cell line from
passage 5 passage 50 ranged 103 199. confirmed riri-px1
cell line derived p. xuthus comparing mitochondrial cytochrome c 
oxidase subunit gene (coi) riri-px1 cells p. xuthus eggs. cell line
was susceptible autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (acnpv) and
produced high yield polyhedral occlusion bodies (43.9obs/cell) 10 days
of infection acnpv. virus titer acnpv infected riri-px1 cells was
3.25×10⁷ tcid₅₀/ml. concluded riri-px1 cell line established 
the neonate larvae tissues successfully cells cell line are
sensitive acnpv.
