objective: human zr75-1 cells among first characterized
estrogen-dependent mammary gland carcinoma cell lines utilized in
various studies pro- antitumor effect xenoestrogens and
antiestrogens. objective study establish breast tumor model 
in zr75-1 cells bearing multimodal reporter genes allow noninvasive imaging of
tumor growth using fluorescence nuclear imaging platforms.
methods results: enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) cdna fused 
the c-terminus herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (hsv1-tk) to
form fusion reporter gene (egfp-tk). vitro proliferation, migration, and
invasion assays revealed egfp-tk-transfected zr75-1 cells exhibited
decreased proliferation rate, migratory activity, invasion ability compared
to wild-type cells. functional hsv1-tk enzymatic activity stably
transfected cells confirmed vitro ganciclovir (gcv) sensitivity and
[123i]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodouracil (fiau) accumulation
assays. vivo fluorescence nuclear imaging performed nude mice
bearing multiple subcutaneous xenografts established zr75-1-egfp-tk and
wild-type cells. optical imaging able detect green fluorescence of
egfp-tk tumor. egfp-tk reporter gene-specific imaging achieved single 
photon emission computed tomography (spect) using [123i]fiau radiotracer and
demonstrated decreased fiau uptake egfp-tk tumor gcv treatment. probably
due flare reaction gcv treatment, micro-positron emission tomography
(micro-pet) imaging using 2-deoxy-2-[18f]fluoro-d-glucose (fdg) could not
demonstrate decreases fdg uptake. however, vitro metabolic assay also
revealed egfp-tk cells transiently increased [3h]-deoxyglucose uptake in
response gcv treatment.
conclusions: study confirmed usefulness egfp-tk many applications 
by providing, vitro vivo, sensitive reporter gene-specific
imaging. zr75-1-egfp-tk cells ready incorporate various imaging
platforms constitute useful model breast cancer research.
