background: several reports indicated non-thermal electromagnetic radiation 
such mobile phones base stations may promote cancer. therefore, it
was investigated experimentally, whether 900 mhz electromagnetic field exposure
influences lymphoma development mouse strain genetically predisposed
to disease. akr/j mice genome carries ak-virus, leads within
one year spontaneous development thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma.
methods: 320 unrestrained female mice sham-exposed exposed (each n = 160 
animals) gsm like 900 mhz electromagnetic fields 24 hours per day, 7 days 
per week, average whole body specific absorption rate (sar) value 0.4
w/kg. animals visually checked daily weighed palpated weekly.
starting age 6 months, blood samples taken monthly tail.
animals signs disease age 46 weeks sacrificed
and gross necropsy performed.
results: electromagnetic field exposure significant effect body weight
gain, higher values exposed sham-exposed animals. however,
survival rate lymphoma incidence differ exposed and
sham-exposed mice.
conclusion: data support hypothesis exposure 900 mhz
electromagnetic fields significant risk factor developing lymphoma 
genetically predisposed species, even relatively high exposure level.
