the effects vegetative structure movement deer mice (peromyscus
maniculatus) examined two distinct vegetation associations, one near
hesperus near molina western colorado (usa) june-october
1994 october 1998. monitored movement live-trapping small mammals within
gambel's oak/mixed-grass (hesperus) sage brush/juniper (molina) vegetation
types. vegetative structure differed sites molina more
cover provided shrubs hesperus cover provided forbs. adult 
male deer mice moved greater distances hesperus molina. sub-adult
males tended move greater distances adult females. relative
abundances deer mice tended differ season, average relative
abundance deer mice greater molina. long-term prevalence infection
with snv greater hesperus greatest adult males hesperus
(36.1%). adult males molina exhibited prevalence infection snv of
25.0%. infection snv highly associated scars wounds adult
male, adult female, juvenile male deer mice hesperus, adult
female deer mice molina. presence scars wounds tended be
associated greater age, male deer mice hesperus likely to
have wounds female deer mice age class. similar pattern,
excluding juveniles, observed molina. intraspecific interactions and
environmentally elicited long-distance movements deer mice may play role 
prevalence infection snv animals.
