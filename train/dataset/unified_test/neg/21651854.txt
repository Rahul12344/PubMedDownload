aim: clarify activeness h9 vitro internalization modulation 
of surface chemokine receptor cx3cr1 induced h9, discuss influence 
of h9 chemokine receptor cx3cr1.
methods: inhibition chemotactic peptide physiological detection of
chemokine induced cell migration activity. flowcytometry examined effection
of h9 intracellular calcium. laser scanning confocal microscopy flow
cytometry used determine quality quantity cx3cr1
internalization.
results: h9 able block migration induced chemokine receptor. the
chemoattraction test, h9 unable induce chemotactic movement, it
does affect signal transduction activeness cells. found
that h9 could induce internalization maximal rate 70%, the
concentration 200 ng/ml. internalized cx3cr1 molecules could recycled to
the cell surface.
conclusion: h9 makes human cx3cr1 internalize. internalizing, cx3cr1
receptor recirculates cell surface. affect cx3cr1 physiology
function. h9 could used specificity anti-virus peptide.
