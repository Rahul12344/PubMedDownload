several aspects immune response bacteriophage ms-2 studied. in
thymectomized, irradiated bone marrow-reconstituted (txbm) mice, response
was normal high dose antigen used. 50-fold lower dose of
ms-2, response impaired, indicating t-cell involvement antibody
formation. evidence (partial) t-cell dependence ms-2 obtained
from experiments anti-thymocyte serum cyclophosphamide-treated mice.
(3h)-thymidine incorporation experiments demonstrated b cells
were active upon vitro stimulation ms-2. dose ms-2 able 
to induce normal response txbm mice, proved optimal both
sensitization elicitation dh. concluded ms-2 a
thymus-dependent antigen thymus independent high doses.
