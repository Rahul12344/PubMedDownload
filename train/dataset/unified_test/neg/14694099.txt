rong et al. demonstrated previously substitutions, the
fourth repeat human low-density lipoprotein (hldl-a4) receptor can
functionally replace ldl-a module tva, cellular receptor subgroup 
a avian sarcoma leukosis virus (aslv-a), viral entry (l. rong, k. gendron,
and p. bates, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 95:8467-8472, 1998). shown 
that swapping amino terminus hldl repeat 5 (hldl-a5) tva, 
addition corresponding substitutions made human ldl-a4, required to
convert hldl-a5 efficient aslv-a receptor. results substantiated
our previous findings regarding role specific residues viral
interaction domain tva demonstrated critical role amino
terminus tva ldl-a module aslv-a infection. furthermore, shown 
that residues cysteines 2 3 tva ldl-a module a
tva/ldl-a5 chimeric protein functionally replaced corresponding
region another ldl-a module, human ldl receptor-related protein repeat 22
(ldl-a22), mediate efficient aslv-a entry. since conserved feature
between c2-c3 region ldl-a22 tva ldl-a module contain
nine amino acids none conserved, conclude spacing
between c2 c3 ldl-a module tva important determinant for
aslv-a entry. thus, present study provides strong evidence support our
hypothesis one role n terminus ldl-a module tva allow
proper folding conformation protein optimal interaction the
viral glycoprotein enva aslv-a entry.
