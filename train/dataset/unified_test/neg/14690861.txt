lytic replication many viruses activates innate host response designed to
prevent completion viral lifecycle, thus impeding spread the
infection. one branch host's complex reaction functions incapacitate
the cellular translational machinery synthesis viral polypeptides
completely depends. achieved activation specific protein
kinases phosphorylate eif2 alpha subunit inactivate critical
translation initiation factor. however, continued synthesis viral proteins 
is required assemble viral progeny necessary transmit infection 
neighboring cells, viruses developed variety strategies counter this
cellular response. genetic biochemical studies herpes simplex virus type
1 (hsv-1) revealed virus produces least two discrete products at
different times replicative program act prevent the
accumulation phosphorylated eif2alpha. gamma(1)34.5 gene product is
expressed first, encoding regulatory subunit binds cellular protein
phosphatase 1alpha regenerates pools active eif2 removing the
inhibitory phosphate alpha subunit. second function, encoded 
product us11 gene, specifies double-stranded rna-binding protein that
prevents activation pkr, cellular eif2alpha kinase. together, proteins 
cooperate overcome antiviral response host properly regulate
translation hsv-1-infected cells.
