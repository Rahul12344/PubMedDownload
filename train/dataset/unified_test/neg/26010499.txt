neutralizing antibodies cellular immune response play essential roles in
the clearance hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. envelope glycoprotein e2 
is major target producing neutralizing antibodies hcv. here, we
constructed recombinant plasmid, termed pcdna3.1-e2-fc, express hcv e2 
an immunoglobulin fc fusion tag (e2-fc). importantly, found titers of
e2-specific igg mice immunized pcdna3.1-e2-fc significantly higher
than mice immunized pcdna3.1-e2. moreover, pcdna3.1-e2-fc
immunization could boost e2-specific lymphocyte proliferation enhance the
secretion ifn-γ lymphocytes upon vitro stimulation soluble e2
compared pcdna3.1-e2 immunization. neutralization assays showed serum
from pcdna3.1-e2-fc immunized mice exhibited effective neutralizing capacity
of hcvpp entry huh-7 cells compared pcdna3.1-e2 immunized
mice, although sera could inhibit virus entry. taken together,
our results imply pcdna3.1-e2-fc immunization could enhance e2-specific
humoral cellular immune response mice thus provide promising
candidate development hcv vaccine.
