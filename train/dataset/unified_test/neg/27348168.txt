the aim study determine hiv rna viral load cd4+ cell count 
to assess severity immune deficiency patients asian ethnicity with
hiv/hcv co-infection different hcv genotypes. 181 hiv-infected patients of
asian ethnicity studied several regions kazakhstan, predominantly
from karaganda region, including prisons. diagnosis hiv infection was
confirmed immunoblotting positive elisa screening test. patient
data analysis extracted patients' medical charts. analysis of
peripheral blood urine, blood biochemistry tests performed each
patient. flow cytometry used determine cd3, cd4 cd8
lymphocytes whole blood. detection quantification hcv rna in
clinical samples serum plasma performed reverse transcription of
viral rna followed amplification using dna real-time polymerase chain reaction
(rt-qpcr) hybridization-fluorescence detection pcr products real-time.
statistical analysis performed using statistica software package. student's t
test used evaluate differences means. hcv antibodies 
detected 73 patients 181. hcv genotyping showed presence first
genotype 18 (24.7%), genotype 2 19 (26.0%) genotype 3 36 (49.3%)
patients. third genotype prevalent according study. 
severe immunosuppression observed patients hcv genotypes 1 3 in
comparison hcv genotype 2. hcv infection negative
risk-factor course hiv infection, accelerating decrease cd4+
cells. greatest risk progression hiv infection aids occurs the
presence hcv genotype 1 3 explained aggressive course
of disease poorer prognosis comparison infection with
genotype 2.
