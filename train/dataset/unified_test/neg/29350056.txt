three new isolates (1-3) including one new sterol two new flavonoids together
with three known sterols (4-6) isolated leaves nicotiana
tabacum. structures determined mainly spectroscopic methods,
including extensive 1d 2d nmr techniques. compounds evaluated for
their anti-tobacco mosaic virus cytotoxic activities. results showed that
compounds 2 3 exhibited high anti-tmv activity inhibition rate 34.2
and 33.4%, respectively, roughly equivalent positive
control. cytotoxicities compounds 1 4-6 five human tumour cell
lines also tested, tested compounds showed weak inhibitory activities
against tested human tumour cell lines.
