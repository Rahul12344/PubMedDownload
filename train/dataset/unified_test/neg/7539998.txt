the hepatitis b virus (hbv) transmitted dialysis setting through
blood transfusions environmental surfaces. transfusion related hepatitis c
virus (hcv) infection well known, recently environmental
transmission virus postulated. order study prevalence,
mechanisms transmission, alt patterns hbv hcv infections in
hemodialysis capd patients implementation hbv vaccination and
hcv screening blood bank, conducted study january 1987 to
january 1990. sera 185 hemodialysis 124 capd patients stored in
this period later analyzed hbsag, anti-hbc, anti-hbs, anti-hcv
(second generation elisa). prevalence hbv marker 55.7% (103/185)
for hemodialysis patients 31.5% (39/124) capd patients (hemodialysis vs. 
capd, p < 0.001). prevalence positive anti-hcv 35.1% (65/185) for
hemodialysis 33.9% (42/124) capd patients (not significant). 
significant association hbv markers positivity anti-hcv positivity.
the multivariate analysis risk factors revealed association the
positivity virus duration renal replacement therapy (rrt),
number previous blood transfusions, past history hemodialysis
treatment. thus, besides transfusion-related transmission, hemodialysis
environmental transmission may also occur viruses. findings a
high prevalence viruses evidence environmental transmission in
the dialysis setting major importance planning future
preventive measures.
