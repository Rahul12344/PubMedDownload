homologs herpes simplex virus gb gene identified two
alpha-herpesviruses platyrrhine monkeys, herpesvirus saimiri 1 (hvs 1) h. 
ateles 1 (hva 1). genes cloned sequenced entirety.
analysis predicted amino acid sequences indicated gb
glycoproteins two viruses similar size, 10 cys residues 
5 potential n-linked glycosylation sites align exactly 
primate alpha-herpesvirus gb polypeptides, similar distribution of
predicted secondary structural features, indicate conserved
structure gb polypeptide. alignment two gb sequences those
of four primate alpha-herpesviruses (sa 8, b virus, hsv 1 hsv 2)
revealed localized regions extensive sequence divergence well highly
conserved regions. comparison six primate virus gb sequences, gbs
of two platyrrhine monkey viruses form subgroup separate the
four catarrhine virus gbs. degree relatedness hva 1 hvs 1 gb
sequences equivalent degree relatedness the
human cercopithecine monkey virus gb sequences.
