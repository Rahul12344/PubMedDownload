apoptosis critical progression human immunodeficiency virus-1
(hiv-1) infection. appears reasonable antiretroviral therapies may not
achieve full control infection absence impact apoptosis.
we assigned 20 asymptomatic hiv-infected subjects advanced immunodeficiency 
to receive either zidovudine (azt), didanosine (ddi) regimen plus
l-carnitine, known antiapoptotic drug, 7 months. immunologic virologic 
parameters measured baseline 15, 60, 120, 210 days of
treatment. assessed time point following: (a) frequency of
peripheral blood apoptotic cd4 cd8 lymphocytes, cd4 cd8 cells with
disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, cd4 cd8 cells undergoing
oxidant stress; (b) expression molecular markers apoptosis fas 
caspase-1; (c) expression p35/cdk-5 regulatory subunit is
involved regulating cell survival apoptosis. absolute cd4 cd8 counts
and plasma viremia also measured. apoptotic cd4 cd8 cells, lymphocytes
with disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, lymphocytes undergoing
oxidant stress greatly reduced subjects treated azt ddi plus
l-carnitine compared receive l-carnitine. fas and
caspase-1 down-expressed p35 over-expressed lymphocytes patients
of l-carnitine group. difference found cd4 cd8 counts and
viremia groups. toxicity l-carnitine recognized. the
addition l-carnitine safe allows apoptosis oxidant stress be
greatly reduced lymphocytes subjects treated azt ddi.
