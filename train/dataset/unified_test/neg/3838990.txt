interaction protein synthesis initiation factors mrna studied in
order characterize early events eukaryotic translation pathway.
individual reovirus mrnas labeled 32p alpha position relative 
m7g cap eukaryotic initiation factor (eif)-4a, -4b, -4f purified from
rabbit reticulocytes employed. found eif-4a causes structural 
change mrna, evidenced nuclease sensitivity test: addition high
concentrations eif-4a greatly increase nuclease sensitivity mrna,
suggesting factor melt "unwind" mrna structure. atp required 
for reaction. low concentrations eif-4a, addition eif-4b is
required maximal unwinding activity. thus eif-4b enhances eif-4a activity.
addition eif-4f also makes mrna sensitive nuclease indicating similar
unwinding role eif-4a. stoichiometric comparisons indicate eif-4f
is 20-fold efficient eif-4a catalyzing reaction. 
unwinding activity eif-4f inhibited m7gdp, eif-4a not. 
this suggests eif-4a functions independent 5' cap structure. our
results also suggest unwinding activity eif-4f located the
46,000-dalton polypeptide complex, shown others be
similar identical eif-4a.
