introduction: epidemiology squamous cell oral cavity pharyngeal
cancers (ocpc) changed rapidly last years, possibly due an
increase human papilloma virus (hpv) positive tumors successes tobacco 
prevention. here, compare incidence survival ocpc hpv-relation of
the site germany united states (us).
materials methods: age-standardized age-specific incidence 5-year
relative survival estimated using data population-based cancer
registries germany us surveillance epidemiology end results (seer)
13 database. incidence estimated year 1999 2013.
relative survival 2002-2005, 2006-2009, 2010-2013 estimated using
period analysis.
results: datasets included 52,787 48,861 cases ocpc diagnosis
between 1997 2013 germany us. incidence much higher germany
compared us hpv-unrelated ocpc recently also hpv-related 
ocpc women. five-year relative survival differences germany us
were small hpv-unrelated ocpc. hpv-related ocpc, men higher survival 
in us (62.1%) germany (45.4%) 2010-2013. differences
increased time largest younger patients stage iv disease
without metastasis. contrast, women comparable survival hpv-related
ocpc countries.
conclusions: strong survival differences germany us observed
for hpv-related ocpc men, might explained differences in
hpv-attributable proportions. close monitoring epidemiology ocpc in
each country needed.
