each metabotropic glutamate receptor possesses large extracellular domain 
consists sequence homologous bacterial periplasmic binding proteins
and cysteine-rich region. previous experiments proposed the
extracellular domain responsible ligand binding. however, currently 
unknown whether extracellular ligand binding site bind ligands without
other domains receptor. began obtaining sufficient amount of
receptor protein baculovirus expression system. addition transfer 
vector encodes entire coding region, transfer vectors encode
portions extracellular domain designed. here, report soluble
metabotropic glutamate receptor encodes extracellular domain and
retains ligand binding characteristic similar full-length
receptor. soluble receptor secreted culture medium showed dimerized
form. furthermore, succeeded purifying homogeneity.
dose-response curves agonists purified soluble receptor examined.
the effective concentration half-maximal inhibition (ic50) quisqualate for
the soluble receptor 3.8 x 10(-8) m, comparable the
full-length receptor. rank order inhibition agonists was
quisqualate >> ibotenate >/= l-glutamate approximately
(1s,3r)-1-aminocyclopentane-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid. data demonstrate a
ligand binding event metabotropic glutamate receptors dissociated 
the membrane domain.
