investigations carried authors demonstrated new specially 
synthesized nonionic detergent, meck, successfully used obtaining pure
influenza virus surface antigens preparative amounts. hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase isolated means meck retain structure biological
activity. special attention devoted study immunological
characteristics preparations thus obtained. high immunogenicity of
solubilized hemagglutinin complete retention antigenic activity
have confirmed. simplicity method isolation influenza 
virus surface antigens purification internal viral proteins and
the detergent make possible recommend method preparative 
isolation external antigens.
