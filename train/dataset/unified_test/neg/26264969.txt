as prostate tumor cell growth depends hormones, androgen ablation an
effective therapy prostate cancer (pca). however, progression pca cells to
androgen independent growth (castrate resistant prostate cancer, crpc) results in
relapse mortality. hypoxia, microenvironment low oxygen modifies
the activity pca regulatory proteins including androgen receptor (ar),
plays critical role progression crpc. therapies targeting hypoxia the
ar may lengthen time crpc progression thereby increasing survival time 
pca patients. mammalian orthoreovirus (mrv) shown promise treatment
of prostate tumors vitro vivo. study, found mrv
infection induces downregulation proteins implicated crpc progression,
interferes hypoxia-induced ar activity, induces apoptosis androgen
dependent cells. suggests mrv possesses traits could exploited to
create novel therapies inhibition progression crpc.
