background: persons acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) use drugs
appear increased risk colonization infection staphylococcus
aureus. little known nature risk factors responsible this
association. study among first prospectively follow carriage and
infection uniquely high-risk population.
methods: prospectively followed cases 75 patients aids a
residential drug treatment facility screened s. aureus nasal colonization
and infection.
results: thirty-seven baseline cultures (49%) positive s. aureus, and
81% subjects colonized least study. thirteen subjects 
experienced 17 infections. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis sequence-based
typing methods revealed 244 (92%) isolates belonged either clonal 
type b. clonal type methicillin-susceptible. clonal type b consisted
of 3 main subtypes (b1, b2, b3), allelic profile (st8) 
staphylococcal protein gene (spa) type (7). note, subtype b1 was
methicillin-susceptible (st8 spa type 7), lacking meca, whereas b
clones methicillin-resistant. clones resistant to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. clonal type b isolates relatively resistant, 
suggesting prior exposure health care setting.
conclusions: study demonstrates sustained high rate s. aureus carriage 
and infection. demonstrates capacity unique methicillin-resistant s.
aureus clones established linkage earlier outbreaks of
methicillin-resistant s. aureus, well human immunodeficiency
virus--infected subjects, persist residential setting. also
illustrates apparent genetic instability transmissibility the
staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec type iv element.
