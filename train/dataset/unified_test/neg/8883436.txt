in order evaluate presence inflammatory process lower
respiratory tract patients mixed cryoglobulinaemia (mc) associated with
hepatitis c virus (hcv), bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) performed 16
non-smoking females free clinical pulmonary symptoms normal chest
roentgenograms. pulmonary function tests including diffusion capacity carbon 
monoxide (dlco) also carried out. thirteen healthy subjects evaluated
as control group. patients mc lower percentage alveolar
macrophages (75% vs 92%, p = 0.001) higher percentage lymphocytes (19.7%
vs 7%, p = 0.001) healthy controls. percentage cd3+ lymphocytes was
higher mc patients controls (86.5% vs 70%, p = 0.004). significant 
differences percentage cd4+, cd8+ cd19+ lymphocytes, neutrophils
and eosinophils found. pulmonary function tests showed significantly lower
values forced expiratory flow (fef) 25-75 (p = 0.05) dlco (p = 0.05) mc
patients healthy controls. correlations bal results and
pulmonary function tests found. 5 yr follow-up five patients 
demonstrate deterioration lung function. thus, bal results indicate a
subclinical t-lymphocytic alveolitis mc hcv+ patients associated
with risk deterioration lung function.
