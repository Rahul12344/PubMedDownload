background: cytomegalovirus (cmv) common opportunistic infection
following lung transplantation. cmv replication lung allograft is
described accelerating development bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
(bos). finding strategy prevent cmv infection important issue.
methods: performed retrospective, single-centre study 114 lung transplant
recipients (ltrs) underwent lung transplantation january 2001 to
december 2006. smaller cohort 88 cmv seropositive (r+) ltrs, three months
of valganciclovir prophylaxis (2004-2006) compared three months oral
ganciclovir (2001-2003) respect incidence cmv infection/disease,
the severity cmv disease, acute rejection, bos-free 4 year survival 4 year
survival. whole group 114 ltrs impact cmv infection long-term
survival (bos free 4 year survival 6 year survival) assessed.
results: cohort 88 cmv seropositive ltrs, incidence cmv
infection/disease one year lower valganciclovir group compared to
the ganciclovir group (24% vs. 54%, p = 0.003). tendency towards
reduced cmv disease, 33% 20% significant lower incidence of
asymptomatic cmv infection (22% vs. 4%, p = 0.005). lower incidence acute
rejection observed valganciclovir group. however, no
significant difference two groups bos free 4 year survival and
4 year survival.for entire group 114 ltrs, bos-free 4 year survival for
recipients cmv disease (32%, p = 0.005) among with
asymptomatic cmv infection (36%, p = 0.061) compared patients without cmv
infection (69%). six year survival lower among patients cmv disease,
(64%, p = 0.042) asymptomatic cmv infection (55%, p = 0.018) patients
without cmv infection (84%).
conclusions: lower incidence cmv infection/disease acute rejections 
observed valganciclovir (3 months) compared oral ganciclovir
(3 months). long-term impact cmv infection/disease significant for
bos-free survival survival.
