background: pcr detection csf herpes virus dna important tool the
diagnosis cns infections. use test shown impact on
patient management measured shortened patient stays, specific therapeutic
intervention, reduction empirical expensive therapy administration, of
which translate significant health care savings.
objective: present study aimed implementing, evaluating both
clinically analytically performance several commercially available pcr
based assays detection herpes virus infections cns.
study design: total 314 patients suspected cns herpesvirus infection
were investigated, 1999 2001, stair primers pcr. starting on
january 2002, two commercially available real-time-pcr systems implemented
and tested using stair primers pcr assay golden standard three
external control proficiency panels along serial dilutions positive
clinical samples.
results: sensitivity assay determined <200 copies per ml hsv
and <1250 copies per ml cmv. positive results obtained 17 patients
(6 hsv-1, 1 hsv-2, 1 ebv, 1 cmv, 6 vzv 2 hhv-6) whose clinical analytical
findings consistent pcr results. real-time-pcr procedure was
introduced 2002 similar sensitivity, rapid response.
conclusion: conventional end-point pcr proved useful diagnosis cns
herpes virus infection, impact clinical intervention. however, the
use real-time-pcr greatly enhanced advantages, making results
available much earlier time, thus significantly reducing need for
empirical treatment.
