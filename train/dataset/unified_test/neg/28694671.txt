aim: evaluate association existed extent hepatic
necrosis initial liver biopsies patient survival.
methods: thirty-seven patients fulminant liver failure, whose liver biopsy
exhibited substantial necrosis, identified included study. the
histological clinical data analyzed order assess the
relationship extent necrosis patient survival, and
without liver transplantation. patients grouped based etiology of
hepatic necrosis. etiology groups stratified
according whether received liver transplant post-index
biopsy, whether patient survived.
results: core tissue length ranged 5 44 mm average 23 mm. 
causes necrosis included 14 autoimmune hepatitis, 10 drug induced liver injury
(dili), 9 hepatitis virus infection, 4 unknown origin. among them, 11 showed 
submassive (26%-75% parenchymal volume) 26 massive (76%-100%)
necrosis. transplant-free survival worse patients higher extent 
necrosis (40%, 71.4% 100% groups necrosis 76%-100%, 51%-75% and
26%-50%, respectively). additionally, transplant-free survival rates 66.7%, 
57.1%, 25.0% groups autoimmune hepatitis, dili, viral hepatitis,
respectively. even liver transplantation, survival rate patients 
a result viral hepatitis remained lowest (80%, 100%, 40% groups 
autoimmune hepatitis, dili, viral hepatitis, respectively).
conclusion: adequate liver biopsy 75% necrosis associated 
significant transplant-free mortality critical predicting survival.
