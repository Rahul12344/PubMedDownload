adenovirus infection.

dna polymerase activity sedimented 7s presence 0.5m kc1 
increased cultured kidney cells infection chicken embryo lethal
orphan virus, avian adenovirus. elevated levels antigenic material a
monoclonal antibody specific large subunit chicken dna polymerase
alpha also detected nuclei virus-infected cells an
immunofluorescence method. since elevations dna polymerase activity of
nuclear immunofluorescence inhibited with
1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, early viral gene(s) seems be
responsible induction synthesis nuclear accumulation dna
polymerase alpha.
