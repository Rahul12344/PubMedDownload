three 1-week-old three 3-month-old holstein calves received
colostrum inoculated endobronchially bovine adenovirus 3 (bav-3). the
gross histologic lesions six infected calves localized mainly
in right caudal lobe lung closely associated site of
the deposition inoculum. pneumonic lesions severe necrotizing
bronchitis, bronchiolitis, alveolitis, accompanied infiltration of
inflammatory cells proliferation type 2 pneumocytes. intranuclear
inclusion bodies, bav-3 antigen, virus particles detected the
degenerated epithelial cells 1-week-old 3-month-old calves.
after infection, total cell count bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid
cells increased. results bav-3 isolation bal fluid were
correlated detection intranuclear inclusion bodies desquamated
epithelial cells bal fluid cells right caudal lobe in
cells left caudal lobe. cd8+ lymphocytes pneumonic lesion 
found 3-month-old infected calves. difference the
immunopathologic reactions 1-week-old 3-month-old infected
calves may attributed differences immune system development.
