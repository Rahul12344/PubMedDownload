reovirus naturally oncolytic virus preferentially replicates in
ras-transformed cells currently undergoing clinical trials cancer
therapeutic. ras transformation promotes reovirus oncolysis enhancing virion
disassembly entry, viral progeny production, virus release through
apoptosis; however, mechanism behind latter well understood. here,
we show reovirus alters intracellular location oncogenic ras to
induce apoptosis h-rasv12-transformed fibroblasts. reovirus infection
decreases ras palmitoylation levels causes accumulation ras golgi
through golgi fragmentation. golgi site ras palmitoylation,
treatment target cells palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate
(2bp), prompts greater accumulation h-rasv12 golgi, a
dose-dependent increase progeny virus release subsequent spread.
conversely, tethering h-rasv12 plasma membrane (thereby preventing its
movement golgi) allows efficient virus production, results in
basal levels reovirus-induced cell death. analysis ras downstream signaling
reveals cells expressing cycling h-rasv12 elevated levels of
phosphorylated jnk (c-jun n-terminal kinase), ras retained golgi 
body 2bp increases activation mekk1/mkk4/jnk signaling pathway to
promote cell death. collectively, data suggest reovirus induces golgi
fragmentation target cells, subsequent accumulation oncogenic ras
in golgi body initiates apoptotic signaling events required virus release
and spread.
