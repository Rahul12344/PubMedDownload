rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) responsible rabbit hemorrhagic
disease (rhd), acute, lethal highly contagious disease both
wild domestic rabbits. although current vaccines highly effective for
controlling rhd, derived infected rabbit livers use is
thus associated safety animal-welfare concerns. study, we
generated recombinant lentogenic canine adenovirus type 2 (cav2) vector
expressing rhdv vp60 gene, named rcav2-vp60. rcav2-vp60 expressed vp60
protein madin-darby canine kidney cells demonstrated western blot and
immunofluorescence assay. polymerase chain reaction confirmed vp60 gene 
was successfully inserted rcav2-vp60 still detectable 20
passages, indicating stable genetic character. evaluated feasibility
of rcav2-vp60 live-virus-vectored rhd vaccine rabbits. rcav2-vp60
significantly induced specific antibodies rhdv provided effective
protection rhdv lethal challenge. results suggest rcav2
expressing rhdv vp60 could safe efficient candidate vaccine rhdv
in rabbits.
