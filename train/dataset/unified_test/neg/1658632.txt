insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) attenuates gh gene expression a
receptor-mediated mechanism pituitary cells. we, therefore, isolated
neomycin-resistant stable gc cell transfectants over-expressing human igf-i
receptor cdna (igfir-cdna) cloned rous sarcoma virus-directed expression
vector. transfection control contained igfir-cdna cloned reverse
orientation. southern analysis confirmed incorporation human igfir-cdna
sequences rat genomic dna. immunoprecipitation metabolically labeled
[35s]methionine stably transfected cells revealed 200-kda human igf-i receptor 
precursor protein. growth rate basal gh secretion altered in
transfected cells. although transfected control cells similar kd for
igf-i binding (0.43 0.40 nm, respectively), igf-i-binding sites induced 
17-fold (384,000 vs. 22,000 sites/cell). treatment cells igf-i (6.5 nm)
maximally attenuated gh secretion 80% compared 40% attenuation control
cells (p less 0.0001). maximal suppression gh transfectants occurred
within 15 h treatment, gh secretion control cells maximally
suppressed 42 h. ed50 igf-i suppression gh secretion in
transfectants 15 h 0.5 nm. results demonstrate transfectants
overexpressing human igf-i receptor hyperresponsive exogenous igf-i. these
data indicate igf-i receptor number plays important role mediating the
signal transduction igf-i gh gene.
