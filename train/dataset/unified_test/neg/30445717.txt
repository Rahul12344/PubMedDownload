base-by-base comprehensive tool creation editing multiple
sequence alignments coded java runs multiple platforms. 
be used gene protein sequences well large viral genomes,
which contain gene annotations. report describes new features
added base-by-base last 7 years. two significant additions
are: (1) recoding inclusion "consensus-degenerate hybrid
oligonucleotide primers" (codehop), popular tool design degenerate
primers multiple sequence alignment proteins; (2) ability to
perform fuzzy searches within columns sequence data multiple sequence
alignments determine distribution sequence variants among the
sequences. intuitive interface focuses presentation results in
easily understood visualizations providing ability annotate the
sequences multiple alignment analytic user data.
