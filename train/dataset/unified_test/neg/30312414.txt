background: vedolizumab (entyvio) humanized α4β7 integrin antagonist
approved treatment inflammatory bowel disease, selectively
blocks gut-specific lymphocyte trafficking. evaluated risk of
opportunistic infections interest patients treated vedolizumab.
methods: determined frequency opportunistic infections tuberculosis
in patients receiving vedolizumab phase 3 clinical trials post-marketing
settings. also evaluated adverse events reported post-marketing setting
in patients history concurrent hepatitis b/c virus infection.
results: incidence opportunistic infections patients receiving
vedolizumab 0.7 (gemini 1 2 clinical trials) 1.0 (long-term safety
study) per 100 patient-years, 217 events reported approximately 114,071
patient-years exposure (post-marketing setting). opportunistic infections
were nonserious majority patients continued treatment with
vedolizumab. clostridium difficile commonly reported infection, with
an incidence rate 0.5 per 100 patient-years (clinical trials). tuberculosis
was reported 0.1 per 100 patient-years (clinical trials), 7 events the
post-marketing setting. tuberculosis-related deaths reported either
setting. cases progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy reported. in
29 patients history concurrent hepatitis b/c infection the
post-marketing setting, viral reactivation observed.
conclusions: clinical trials post-marketing data showed rate of
serious opportunistic infections patients receiving vedolizumab low and
most patients could continue vedolizumab treatment. frequency tuberculosis
infection also low hepatitis b/c viral reactivation reported.
