six derivatives human papillomavirus type 16 e7 gene constructed,
each encoded peptide amino terminus e7 protein capable
of chelating metal ions, use subsequent purification proteins by
chelating peptide-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (cp-imac). five
of six chelating peptides examined contained six amino acids, varied
in number histidine tryptophan residues. cp-e7 proteins were
expressed escherichia coli, cysteine residues blocked form
of s-sulfonate groups. series cp-e7 proteins purified single
chromatographic step using cp-imac. efficiency purification correlated
with number histidine tryptophan residues present cp. the
purified cp-e7 proteins bound human retinoblastoma gene product, prb, in
in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays immobilized cp-e7 binding assays. 
efficiency e7-prb binding altered presence cp the
n-terminus e7 s-sulfonate groups within e7.
