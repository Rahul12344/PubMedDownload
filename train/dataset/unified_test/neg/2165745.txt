four patients 4 24 years age (3 males, 1 female) generalized
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, intermittent fever associated with
chronic active epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection investigated. laboratory
data showed polyclonal gammopathy tendency bone marrow suppression.
noteworthy extremely elevated immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers 
epstein-barr viral capsid antigen (vca) (range, 10,240-81,920) early antigen 
(ea) (range, 1,280-40,960). patients iga antibodies vca ea.
subtle, heterogeneous immune functional defects observed four
patients. another unusual feature inability establish spontaneous or
b95-8 ebv-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) due marked
cytopathic effect (cpe). thus, investigated viruses. igg and
igm antibodies adenovirus type-2 (ad-2) positive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) immunofluorescence (if) test, suggesting recent
or activated ad-2 infection occurred. dual active ebv ad-2 infections
were likely etiologic severe chronic active ebv infection syndrome.
