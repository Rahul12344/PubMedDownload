purpose: genetically explore fusion protein gene (f) human
parainfluenza virus type 1 (hpiv1) type 3 (hpiv3) strains, analysed them
in patients acute respiratory infections eastern japan 2011 2015.
methodology: constructed phylogenetic trees based hpiv hpiv3 f gene
using maximum likelihood method conducted p-distance selective
pressure analyses. also predicted linear epitopes protein the
prototype strains. furthermore, mapped amino acid substitutions the
proteins.
results: nineteen strains hpiv1 53 strains hpiv3 detected among
the clinical acute respiratory infection cases. phylogenetic trees indicated 
that hpiv1 hpiv3 strains classified clusters ii iii and
cluster c, respectively. p-distance values hpiv1 hpiv3 f genes
were <0.03. two positive selection sites inferred hpiv1 (aa 8 aa 
10), one positive selection site inferred hpiv3 (aa 108), over
10 negative selection sites inferred. four epitopes predicted the
hpiv1 prototype strains, five epitopes predicted hpiv3
prototype strain. positive selection site (aa 108) hpiv3 f protein was
involved predicted epitope. additionally, found amino acid
substitution (r73k) lc76627 hpiv3 strain presumably may affect the
resistance neutralization antibodies.
conclusion: f gene hpiv1 hpiv3 relatively well conserved the
eastern part japan investigation period.
