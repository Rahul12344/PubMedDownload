a rapid quantitative method described determining 3-fluorotyrosine
incorporation proteins. derivatives tyrosine 3-fluorotyrosine with
o-phthalaldehyde well separated one another reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography system used routine analyses of
o-phthalaldehyde-amino acid derivatives. since amino acids well resolved
from derivatized amino acids, method useful amino acid
analyses proteins. determination fluorotyrosine content proteins 
this method involves single separation step, reproducible, requires no
corrections stability yield. further, o-phthalaldehyde derivatives 
5-fluorotryptophan, 2-fluorophenylalanine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, and
4-fluorophenylalanine also resolved. method may generally
applicable fluorinated aromatic amino acid-labeled proteins studied
structurally dynamically nuclear magnetic resonance.
