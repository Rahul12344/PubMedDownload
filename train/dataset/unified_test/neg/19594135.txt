crystal structures simulations suggest conformational changes are
critical function hiv-1 reverse transcriptase. enzyme an
asymmetric heterodimer two subunits, p66 p51. two subunits the
same n-terminal sequence, p51 subunit lacking c-terminal rnase h
domain. used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry probe structural
dynamics rt. h/d exchange revealed fingers palm subdomains of
both subunits form stable core heterodimer. crystal structure, 
the tertiary fold p51 subunit compact polymerase 
domain p66 subunit, yet subunits show similar flexibility. p66
subunit contains polymerase rnase h catalytic sites. h/d exchange
indicated rnase h domain p66 flexible. beta-sheet
beta12-beta13-beta14 lies base thumb subdomain p66 contains 
highly conserved residues involved template/primer binding nnrti binding. 
using unique ability hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry resolve slowly
interconverting species, found beta-sheet beta12-beta13-beta14 undergoes 
slow cooperative unfolding t(1/2) <20 s. h/d exchange results are
discussed relation existing structural, simulation, sequence
information.
