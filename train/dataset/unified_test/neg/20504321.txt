background: porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome prrs virus (prrsv)
infection, causes significant economic losses annually, one 
economically important diseases affecting swine industry worldwide. 2006 and
2007, large-scale outbreak highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (prrs) happened china vietnam. however little data is
available global host response prrsv infection protein level, and
similar approaches looking mrna problematic since mrna levels not
necessarily predict protein levels. order improve knowledge host
response viral pathogenesis highly virulent chinese-type prrsv (h-prrsv)
and non-high-pathogenic north american-type prrsv strains (n-prrsv), analyzed 
the protein expression changes h-prrsv n-prrsv infected lungs compared
with uninfected negative control, identified series proteins
related host response viral pathogenesis.
results: according differential proteomes porcine lungs infected with
h-prrsv, n-prrsv uninfected negative control different time points using
two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2d-dige) mass
spectrometry identification, 45 differentially expressed proteins (deps) were
identified. proteins mostly related cytoskeleton, stress response
and oxidation reduction metabolism. protein interaction network
constructed based deps lungs infected h-prrsv, hspa8, arhgap29 and
ndufs1 belonged central proteins, whereas ddah2, hspb1 flna
corresponded central proteins n-prrsv infected.
conclusions: study first attempt provide complex picture of
pulmonary protein expression h-prrsv n-prrsv infection in
vivo environment using 2d-dige technology bioinformatics tools, provides
large scale valuable information better understanding host proteins-virus
interactions two prrsv strains.
