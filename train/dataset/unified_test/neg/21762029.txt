dandy-walker malformation (dwm) developmental abnormality characterized by
cystic dilatation fourth ventricle, complete partial agenesis the
cerebellar vermis, enlarged posterior fossa upward displacement the
lateral sinuses, tentorium, torcula. calcification brain tissue a
feature congenital infection, particularly involving torch (
toxoplasma gondii , rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus) group. an
autosomal-recessive congenital infection-like syndrome intracranial and
extracranial calcifications categorized pseudo-torch syndrome. we
describe two male siblings diagnosed dwm ultrasound utero and
postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (mri) neuropathology
revealed features intracranial necrosis calcification absence of
extracranial calcific deposition. fetal anomaly identified routine
prenatal ultrasound scan 16 weeks. cases postmortem mri showed
bilateral ventriculomegaly distortion overlying cortices, enlarged
posterior fossa cyst related small cerebellar hemispheres, an
incomplete cerebellar vermis. diagnosis dwm offered. histology
revealed hypoplastic cerebral hemispheres poorly cellular developing cortex.
the white matter periventricular matrix disrupted areas necrosis
and calcification associated inflammatory infiltration, organisms,
inclusions, giant cells. knowledge, two male siblings 1st
cases show pseudo-torch syndrome distinctive intracranial calcification
presenting dwm. autosomal-recessive x-linked inheritance needs be
considered. study confirms relevance multidisciplinary teamwork
involved diagnosis complex cases.
