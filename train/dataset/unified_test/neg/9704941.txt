purpose: describe recent evolution antiretroviral prescriptions 
look clinical biological changes among population hiv-infected

subjects: patients received follow-up hospital-based information system of
the groupe d'epidémiologie clinique du sida en aquitaine (gecsa), southwestern
france, 1995 1997.
methods: quarterly evolution prescriptions antiretroviral treatments
and population clinical biological indicators studied this
observational survey computerized records obtained hospital
contact.
results: overall numbers patients received follow-up hospital
contacts remained stable. proportion untreated patients decreased from
38.5% 10.5%. monotherapies progressively abandoned. double combination
therapies two nucleoside analogues used 55% patients by
early 1996 decreased, whereas triple combination therapies one
protease inhibitor (pi) rapidly increased comprise 40% the
prescriptions 1997. pis prescribed earlier earlier course of
hiv infection. overall incidence aids diagnoses mortality rate decreased
by 18% 22%, respectively, first 9 months use pis compared with
the preceding 9 months, 47% 56%, respectively, following 9
months (p<.001). number hospitalizations proportion patients
with cd4 cell count <200/mm3 decreased. aids cases diagnosed introduction
of pis rarely treated pis.
