background: amino acid sequence diversity introduced phage-displayed
peptide library randomizing library oligonucleotide dna. recently evaluated
the diversity peptide libraries displayed t7 lytic phage m13
filamentous phage showed t7 phage display diverse amino acid 
sequence repertoire due differing processes viral morphogenesis.
methods: study, evaluated compared diversity 12-mer t7
phage-displayed peptide library randomized using codon-corrected trinucleotide
cassettes t7 m13 12-mer phage-displayed peptide library constructed
using degenerate codon randomization method.
results: herein demonstrate combination trinucleotide cassette
amino acid codon randomization t7 phage display construction methods resulted
in significant enhancement functional diversity 12-mer peptide
library. novel library exhibited superior amino acid uniformity and
order-of-magnitude increases amino acid sequence diversity compared to
degenerate codon randomized peptide libraries. comparative analyses the
biophysical characteristics 12-mer peptide libraries revealed the
trinucleotide cassette-randomized library unique resource.
conclusion: combination t7 phage display trinucleotide cassette
randomization resulted novel resource potential isolation binding
peptides new previously studied molecular targets.
