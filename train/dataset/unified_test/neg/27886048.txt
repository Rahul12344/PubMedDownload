the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) unspliced transcript used both
as mrna synthesis structural proteins packaged genome.
given presence retained introns instability au-rich sequences, this
viral transcript normally retained degraded nucleus host cells
unless viral protein rev present. such, stability hiv-1
unspliced mrna must particularly controlled nucleus cytoplasm
in order ensure proper levels viral mrna translation viral
particle formation. journey, hiv-1 unspliced mrna assembles into
highly specific messenger ribonucleoproteins (mrnps) containing many different
host proteins, amongst well-known regulators cytoplasmic mrna decay 
pathways up-frameshift suppressor 1 homolog (upf1), staufen
double-stranded rna binding protein 1/2 (stau1/2), components mirna-induced
silencing complex (mirisc) processing bodies (pbs). recently, hiv-1 
unspliced mrna shown contain n⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶a), allowing the
recruitment yth n⁶-methyladenosine rna binding protein 2 (ythdf2), m⁶a
reader host protein involved mrna decay. interestingly, host proteins
involved mrna decay shown play positive roles viral gene expression
and viral particle assembly, suggesting hiv-1 interacts mrna decay
components successfully accomplish viral replication. review summarizes
the state art terms interactions hiv-1 unspliced mrna
and components different host mrna decay machineries.
