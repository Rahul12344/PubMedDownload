background: gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (gdept) based e. coli
enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (pnp) represents new approach for
treating slow growing tumours like prostate cancer (pca). expressed enzyme
converts systemically administered prodrug, fludarabine phosphate, toxic
metabolite, 2-fluoroadenine. infected neighbouring cells killed a
bystander effect results inhibition dna rna synthesis.
methods: studies carried using transgenic adenocarcinoma of
the prostate (tramp) model mimics human pca development progression.
control tramp mice injected intraprostatically vector vehicle and
thereafter intraperitoneally saline fludarabine phosphate ( approximately
600 mg/m(2)/day) daily 5 consecutive days. treated mice received a
single intraprostatic injection containing 10(10) particles oadv220, ovine 
atadenovirus expresses e. coli pnp gene control rous
sarcoma virus promoter, followed systemic fludarabine treatment. weight of
the genitourinary tract, seminal vesicles prostate well animal
survival monitored. tumours also analysed histologically.
results: preliminary studies showed fludarabine alone caused significant 
change genitourinary (gu) tract weight tramp mice. animals injected with
vector prodrug showed significant reduction (36-47%) gu tract weight
(anova p = 0.0002) 35-50% reduction seminal vesicle weight (anova p =
0.0007). particular, target organ showed significant 57% reduction in
prostate weight (anova p = 0.0007). pnp-gdept mice also showed survival
advantage control mice. histological analysis suggested cancer
progression slowed gdept-treated animals.
conclusion: single course gdept based oadv-delivered pnp fludarabine 
produced highly significant suppression pca progression immune-competent
tramp mice.
