pro-inflammatory cytokines important mediators immune responses against
invading pathogens, including viruses. precursors pro-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin (il)-1Î² il-18 processed caspase-1. caspase-1 
activated autocleavage, regulated remained elusive 
long time. 2002, intracellular multimeric complex discovered that
facilitated caspase-1 cleavage termed 'inflammasome'. date, different 
inflammasomes described, recognize variety ligands and
pathogens. review, discuss role inflammasomes sensing viral 
infection well evasion strategies viruses developed circumvent 
inflammasome-dependent effects.
