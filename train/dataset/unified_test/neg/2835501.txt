we used two kinds adeno-associated virus (aav) vectors transduce the
neomycin resistance gene human cells. first (dl52-91) retains
the aav rep genes; second (dl3-94) retains aav terminal repeats 
the aav polyadenylation signal (428 base pairs). vectors could packaged
into aav virions produced proviral structures essentially same.
thus, aav sequences required cis packaging (pac), integration
(int), rescue (res), replication (ori) viral dna located within a
284-base-pair sequence includes terminal repeat. g418r cell 
lines (73%) contained proviruses could rescued (res+) cells
were superinfected appropriate helper viruses. produced high yields
of viral dna; rescued 50-fold lower level. lines were
res+ (79%) contained tandem repeat aav genome (2 20 copies) was
integrated randomly respect cellular dna. junctions two
consecutive aav copies tandem array contained either one two copies of
the aav terminal palindrome. junctions aav cellular sequences
occurred predominantly within aav terminal repeat, cases at
internal aav sequences. two lines seen contained free episomal copies
of aav dna. res+ clones contained deleted proviruses tandem repeats a
deleted genome. occasionally, flanking cellular dna also amplified. was
no superinfection inhibition aav dna integration. results suggest aav
sequences amplified dna replication either integration and
that mechanism replication different one used aav lytic
infections. addition, described new aav general transduction vector,
dl3-94, provides maximum amount room insertion foreign dna
and integrates high frequency (80%).
