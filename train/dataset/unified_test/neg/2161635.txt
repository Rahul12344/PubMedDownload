varicella zoster virus (vzv)-specific igg iga antibody titers determined
in serial serum samples 23 patients ramsay hunt syndrome the
immunoperoxidase assay. varicella zoster virus-specific igg antibodies found
in first serum samples patients. 80% 20 patients a
serum sample available within 5 days onset disease.
vzv-specific iga antibodies detected. second serum sample was
vzv-specific iga-positive patients. healthy age- 
sex-matched control subjects vzv-specific igg antibodies, vzv-specific iga
antibodies detected low titer (dilution = 2) three the
subjects. using vzv-specific iga antibody titers greater equal 2
and greater equal 4 immunoperoxidase assay "cutoff" for
younger older patients ramsay hunt syndrome, respectively, early
diagnosis disease obtained 89% younger 64% 
older patients single serum sample.
