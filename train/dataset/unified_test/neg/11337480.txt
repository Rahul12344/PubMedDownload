many missense substitutions identified single nucleotide polymorphism
(snp) data large-scale random mutagenesis projects. amino acid
substitution potentially affects protein function. constructed tool
that uses sequence homology predict whether substitution affects protein
function. sift, sorts intolerant tolerant substitutions, classifies
substitutions tolerated deleterious. higher proportion substitutions
predicted deleterious sift gives affected phenotype than
substitutions predicted deleterious substitution scoring matrices in
three test cases. using sift mutagenesis studies could reduce number
of functional assays required yield higher proportion affected
phenotypes. may used identify plausible disease candidates among snps
that cause missense substitutions.
