pregnant women, students. commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

farmers approximately 3.5-fold increased risk (odds ratio [or], 3.46; 95% 
confidence interval [ci], 1.91-6.27; p<0.0001) seropositive igg
anti-hev compared general population. age positively associated
with seropositive rate (or, 1.07 per year; 95% ci, 1.05-1.09; p<0.0001).
