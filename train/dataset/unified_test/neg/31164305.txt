zika virus (zikv) first detected brazil 2015 rapidly spread to
more 80 countries africa, asia americas. zikv infection was
correlated severe congenital malformations newborns infected
mothers, well guillain-barré syndrome adults. although number
of infected people declined affected countries lately, development
of vaccine zikv great importance avoid future resurgence of
the virus endemic areas future spread currently non-endemic regions.
among many different platforms currently study, virus-like particles (vlps)
are promising alternative development vaccines, since tridimensional
particles mimicking virus - lacking genome - produced and
present antigen repetitive way, potentially eliciting robust immune
responses. work, demonstrated generation stably transfected
hek293 cells constitutively expressing zika vlps. small-scale shake flask studies
using stable cell pool enriched fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs)
showed daily medium exchange (intermittent perfusion) significantly enhances
viable cell density vlp production (∼4-fold) batch cultures. continuous 
perfusion controlled bioreactor coupled atf-2 cell retention device
resulted maximum vlp titers similar obtained small-scale
intermittent perfusion. results show use cell lines
constitutively expressing zika vlps, cultured stirred-tank perfusion
bioreactors, represents promising system production vlp-based zika
vaccine candidate.
