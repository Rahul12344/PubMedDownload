natural killer cytotoxicity (nkc) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(adcc) represent one body's primary lines defense viral
infections, including herpes simplex (hsv). immune defense system is
negatively influenced prostaglandins. project undertaken evaluate the
influence antiprostaglandin agent vivo cytotoxic effects
against cells infected hsv. thirteen subjects without previous histories 
clinical herpes simplex infection studied menses without
naproxen therapy. statistically significant augmentation (p = 0.05) natural 
killer-cell function identified mononuclear cells therapy. subjects
with baseline cytotoxicity less 45% demonstrated consistent elevations
during naproxen therapy. significant differences could found for
mononuclear polymorphonuclear cells regard nkc adcc. appears
to subset patients may benefit immunologic augmentation with
antiprostaglandin agents experiencing herpes simplex virus infection.
