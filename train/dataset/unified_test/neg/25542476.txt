bkpyv-specific igm igg measurements weekly samples three months
post-transplant. gastrointestinal bleeding observed >100-fold
increase plasma bkpyv loads start hemorrhagic cystitis. the
bkpyv-specific antibody response indicated past infection prior to
transplantation, increasing igg titers seen following bkpyv replication.

gastrointestinal complications bleeding significant problem after
allogeneic hsct viral infections including bkpyv may contribute.
