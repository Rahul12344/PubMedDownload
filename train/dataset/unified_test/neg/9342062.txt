objective: review short-term response safety protease inhibitor
therapy hiv-infected children.
design: retrospective chart review open-label protease inhibitor-containing
combination therapy.
setting: two urban pediatric hiv centers.
patients: twenty-eight hiv-infected children prescribed 30 protease
inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy combinations. median age at
initiation protease inhibitor antiretroviral therapy 79 months. patients
had previous antiretroviral therapy mean 45.5 months.
results: 28 children completed least 1 month therapy, 26
experienced marked virologic immunologic improvement (mean maximal decrease
in viral load 1.90 log10 copies/ml; sd, 0.8; mean maximal rise cd4+
lymphocytes 279 x 10(6)/l; sd, 300 x 10(6)/l). eleven patients achieved a
viral nadir < 400 copies/ml, seven sustained level viral
suppression mean 6 months. indinavir use associated high
incidence renal side-effects, including two patients developed
interstitial nephritis. two patients ritonavir experienced significant
elevation liver enzymes.
conclusions: protease inhibitor therapy associated substantial
short-term virologic immunologic improvement primarily heavily
pretreated cohort, 25% maintaining viral load < 400 copies/ml 6
months therapy. significant rate adverse events.
pharmacokinetic safety data needed guide aggressive antiretroviral
therapy hiv-infected children, treatment options required 
those failing intolerant available protease inhibitors.
