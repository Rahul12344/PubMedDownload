plant reoviruses known exploit virion-packaging tubules formed by
virus-encoding non-structural proteins viral spread insect vectors.
tubules propelled actin-based tubule motility (abtm) overcome membrane 
or tissue barriers insect vectors. understand insect factors 
mediate abtm, utilized yeast two-hybrid bimolecular fluorescence
complementation assays test interactions tubule protein pns10 rice 
dwarf virus (rdv), plant reovirus, proteins insect vector, the
leafhopper nephotettix cincticeps. tropomodulin (tmod), vitellogenin, and
lipophorin precursor n. cincticep displayed positive strong interaction
with pns10, actin-associated protein tmod interacted pns10 pull-down 
assay co-immunoprecipitation system. further, determined pns10 tubules
associated tmod cultured cells midgut n. cincticep. expression
dynamic tmod consistent pns10 fluctuation rdv
accumulation. knockdown tmod inhibited pns10 expression viral
accumulation, thus decreasing viruliferous rates leafhopper. results
suggested tmod involved viral spread directly interacting with
pns10 tubules, finally promoting rdv infection. study provided direct
evidence plant reoviruses utilizing actin-associated protein manipulate 
abtm insect vectors, thus facilitating viral spread.
