the modern environmental food analysis requires sensitive, accurate, and
rapid methods. growing field biosensors represents answer this
demand. unfortunately, biosensor systems tested distilled 
water buffered solutions, although applications real samples are
increasingly appearing recent years. context, biosensors potential
food applications continue show advances areas genetic modification
of enzymes microorganisms, improvement recognition element immobilization,
and sensor interfaces. chapter investigates progress development 
of biosensors rapid detection food toxicants online applications. 
recent progress nanotechnology produced affordable, mass-produced devices,
and integrate components systems (including portable ones) 
mass market applications food toxicants monitoring. sensing includes chemical
and microbiological food toxicants, toxins, insecticides, pesticides,
herbicides, microorganisms, bacteria, viruses microorganisms, phenolic 
compounds, allergens, genetically modified foods, hormones, dioxins, etc.
therefore, state art recent advances future targets the
development biosensors food monitoring summarized follows:
biosensors food analysis highly sensitive, selective, rapidly
responding, real time, massively parallel, minimum sample preparation,
and platform suited portable handheld nanosensors rapid detection 
of food toxicants online uses even nonskilled personnel.
