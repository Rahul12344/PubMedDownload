hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) fifth common cancer worldwide a
poor prognosis one immunotherapy remains viable option.
experimental tumor models shown regulatory cells, functionally
unique subset cells, suppress effective antitumor immune responses. this
suppression might explain poor outcome immunotherapy protocols
currently used. better understanding role regulatory cells in
hcc important design future immunotherapy-based clinical protocols. 
have studied regulatory cells 84 patients hcc 74 controls,
including healthy donors, patients chronic hepatitis b virus hepatitis c
virus infection nonviral liver cirrhosis. regulatory cells identified 
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using panel antibodies by
real-time pcr analysis foxp3 expression. functional studies done to
analyze inhibitory role. finally, regulatory cells analyzed in
tumors ascites patients hcc. patients hcc increased
numbers cd4+cd25+ regulatory cells peripheral blood, express 
high levels hla-dr, gitr, low cd45ra. cells anergic
toward t-cell receptor stimulation and, cocultured activated cd4+cd25- 
cells, potently suppressed proliferation cytokine secretion. were
also high numbers regulatory cells tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes hcc 
patients comparable increase peripheral blood. data suggest
that increase frequency regulatory cells might play role in
modulation immune response hcc could important design of
immunotherapeutic approaches.
