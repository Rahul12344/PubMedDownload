helminthic infections occur worldwide, especially developing countries. 
one-quarter world's population, 1.5 billion, infected one more
of major soil-transmitted helminths, including hookworms, ascarids, and
whipworms. schistosomes infect 200 million people worldwide 600
million risk 74 countries. interaction helminths host's
immune system provokes particular immunomodulatory immunoregulatory
mechanisms ensure survival host years. however, these
changes might impair immunological response bystander bacterial, viral,
and protozoal pathogens vaccination. modulation immune system by
infection helminthic parasites proposed reduce levels allergic 
responses protect inflammatory bowel disease. review, we
summarize immunological milieu associated helminthic infections 
impact viral infections, mainly hepatitis b virus, hepatitis c virus, and
human immunodeficiency virus humans experimental animals.
