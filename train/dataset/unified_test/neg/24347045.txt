orf (contagious ecthyma) exanthematic disease caused parapoxvirus 
occurs primarily sheep goats zoonotic implications. present
investigation, orf outbreak muzzaffarnagari sheep flock central 
institute research goats (cirg), makhdoom, mathura, uttar pradesh, india, 
was investigated. primary goat testes cell culture used isolation 
orf virus (orfv) first time. identity virus confirmed by
amplification sequence analysis major envelope glycoprotein (b2l) gene
and named orfv/sheep/india/2012/cirg. phylogenetic analysis b2l protein
gene, clustered orfv strains china suggesting distinct orfv
strains circulating india. comparison nucleotide deduced amino
acid sequence analysis (n = 63), unique 126s residue observed in
orfv/sheep/india/2012/cirg. sequence analysis (b2l) different orfv 
strains (n = 63), conserved amino acid residues identified as
host-specific (sheep, human, camel, takin, musk ox) summarized.
