human b lymphocytes undergo distinct phenotypic changes following activation with
antigen polyclonal mitogens. increasing interest focused unique
subpopulation b cells expresses cd5 antigen. study, we
examined signals induce expression cd5 normal splenic b cells.
only 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa) induced cd5 expression highly 
purified splenic b cells, whereas anti-immunoglobulin (anti-ig), epstein-barr
virus, anti-cd20, recombinant interleukin-1 (ril-1), ril-2, ril-4, recombinant
interferon-gamma (rinf-gamma), b-cell growth factor failed induce cd5 
expression. expression cd5 detected cell surface 48 hours
and decreased 96 hours. dual-fluorochrome analysis demonstrated cd5+ 
b cells coexpressed b-cell activation antigens b5, il-2 receptor, cd23,
thereby providing phenotypic evidence b-cell subpopulation is
activated. vitro studies dual-fluorochrome-sorted, tpa-stimulated splenic b
cells demonstrated significantly greater tritiated thymidine incorporation ig
secretion cd20+ cd5- cells cd20+ cd5+ subset. phenotypic
and functional studies consistent notion tpa-induced cd5+ b
cells subset vitro activated b lymphocytes.
