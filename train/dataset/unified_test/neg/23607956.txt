objective: investigate effects down-regulating tim-3 gene the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) asthmatic mouse model short
hairpin rna (shrna) explore effect tim-3 th1 th17 cell
differentiation.
methods: asthmatic murine model established ovalbumin sensitization and
challenge. pbmcs isolated asthmatic mice transfected shrna
targeting tim-3 gene. mrna protein expressions tim-3 detected 
quantitative pcr western blot. flow cytometry analysis performed to
determine levels th1 th17, elisa performed determine
concentrations ifn-γ, il-4 il-17 supernatant.
results: tim-3 mrna expression pbmcs significantly increased asthmatic 
mice. mrna protein expression tim-3 decreased significantly the
shrna group. compared negative groups, th1 cell levels increased and
th17 cell levels decreased significantly asthmatic groups tim-3
shrna interference. tim-3 shrna interference groups concentrations of
ifn-γ increased significantly il-17 decreased significantly.
conclusions: specific tim-3 shrna effectively silences expression tim-3
and change tim-3 expression could affect cell differentiation.
