it shown small fraction cd4+ cells infected with
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vivo, particularly early the
course infection. even smaller proportion cells shown be
expressing virus. recent studies suggest plasma viremia asymptomatic
hiv-infected individuals, representing active viral replication, common
than previously believed (range 23-100% patients). determine in
vivo state hiv expression, samples peripheral blood 49 hiv-infected
individuals stages disease examined. subjects positive
for viral dna standard polymerase chain reaction (pcr), modified pcr was
utilized detect hiv-specific mrnas (gag, major splice junction, env, and
tat/rev). patient's plasma also assayed p24 antigen viremia. the
results follows: (formula: see text) overall, findings suggest that
active viral expression occurs stages hiv infection. particular, the
presence gag mrna determined 2 14 patients t4% greater
than 30% 20 35 patients t4% less equal 30% (p less than
0.05), demonstrating direct association presence message a
structural protein, advanced immunosuppression. determination the
expression certain hiv-specific messages within patient's cells adds 
new dimension understanding pathogenesis hiv infection. presence of
hiv-specific mrnas, particular gag message, many healthy seropositives 
may argue early initiation antiviral therapy.
