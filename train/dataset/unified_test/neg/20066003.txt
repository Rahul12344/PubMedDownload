smallpox deadly disease rife yet despite eradication more
than 30 years ago, possibility accidental intentional release has
driven research search better definitions correlates protective
immunity. mousepox, disease caused ectromelia virus (ectv), arguably one 
of best surrogate small animal models smallpox. correlates protection 
in mousepox well defined primary infection, whereas a
secondary infection, definite relevance vaccination strategies, are
less well understood. previously established neutralizing antibody (ab), 
which generated far rapidly secondary infection compared 
primary infection, key role secondary virus challenge. this
study, show route immunization use homologous or
heterologous virus vaccines immunization influence ability of
mice control high-dose virulent ectv challenge mount substantial
secondary neutralizing ab response. contrast, recall cytotoxic t
lymphocyte (ctl) responses generated regimes immunization were
varied correlate virus control. furthermore, unlike recall
ab response generated rapidly, kinetics secondary antiviral
ctl response different primary infection peaked day 8
post-challenge. finding underscores importance ab in
conferring protection secondary poxvirus infection. information could
potentially prove useful design safer efficacious vaccines
against poxviruses diseases using poxvirus vectors.
