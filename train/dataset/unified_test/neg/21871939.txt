recombinant hepatitis b surface antigen virus-like particles (vlps) produced in
yeast undergo spontaneous maturation vaccine production process, and
the biophysical characteristics particles respect maturation 
described zhao et al. (2006) [13]. report additional biochemical and
immunochemical characterization various techniques, including use a
panel monoclonal antibodies (mabs) differ selectivity and
conformation-sensitivity, probing surface epitope structures. crosslinking
via interchain disulfide formation binding conformational specific
antibodies mature particles shown progressively enhanced. we
show redox-mediated vlp maturation superior heat-induced maturation in
terms generating vlps exhibit complete crosslinking (>95%) 2-
to 3-fold higher antigenicity defined conformational antibodies. therefore,
the resulting vlps redox treatment resemble closely their
plasma-derived counterparts. value using multiple mabs probing surface
epitopes clearly demonstrated different mabs showed different degrees of
sensitivity structural changes hbsag vlp maturation. rapid,
label-free technology surface plasmon resonance performed single antigen 
concentration shown correlate well sandwich elisa using parallel
line analysis, currently implemented product release stability testing of
recombivax hb(®). surface plasmon resonance offers convenience and
flexibility; multiple mabs tested one time set of
experiments, providing means assess changes individual epitopes. taken
together, quantitative analytical tools enable rapid, in-depth, and
comprehensive process monitoring, process optimization, assessment product
consistency stability.
