comparative study reactogenicity immunogenicity influenza a/new
jersey/8/76 (hsw1n1) virus vaccines normal volunteers.

betts rf, douglas rg jr.

local systemic reactions antibody responses three different doses of
influenza virus vaccine (a/new jersey/76 [hsw1n1]) produced four different
manufacturers studied. local systemic reactions peaked 8
and 24 hr vaccine administration related source vaccine 
more dose. antibody conversion occurred almost 90% subjects
over age 25 years 61% subjects 25 years younger. this
low response rate due almost entirely lack response volunteers
who received split-product vaccine (only 49% subjects became seropositive). in
addition, individuals symptoms local reaction rate antibody
conversion magnitude antibody response significantly higher than
those observed subjects local reactions. findings
suggest subjects older 25 years, four vaccines produced high
frequency antibody response minimum side effects. addition,
split-virus vaccine less immunogenic whole-virus vaccine subjects
younger 25 years. production vaccine devoid local reaction may not
be advisable.
