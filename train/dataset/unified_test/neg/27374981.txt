parasitoid wasps reproduce laying eggs inside host insect,
which triggers defense response host insect kills developing
wasp. counteract host's lethal response, parasitoid wasps are
associated symbiotic viruses alter host metabolism development to
promote successful development wasp embryo. symbiotic viruses
display number characteristics differ pathogenic viruses,
but poorly understood exception one group, polydnaviruses.
here, characterize genome non-polydnavirus associated parasitoid
wasps, diachasmimorpha longicaudata rhabdovirus (dlrhv), assess role a
potential mutualistic virus. results show dlrhv genome contains six 
open reading frames (orfs). three orfs show sequence homology known viral
genes one orf encodes previously identified protein, called
parasitism-specific protein 24 (psp24), hypothesized play role
in promoting successful parasitism d. longicaudata. constructed phylogeny
that shows dlrhv closely related insect-infecting
rhabdoviruses. finally, report dlrhv infection occur all
populations d. longicaudata, required successful parasitism.
