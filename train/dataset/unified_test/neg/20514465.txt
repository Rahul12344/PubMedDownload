the activity telomerase, ribonucleoprotein maintaining length of
chromosome ends (telomeres) levels allowing cells replicate indefinitely,
is undetectable normal, differentiated cells, present low levels some
activated cell types (including endothelial cells) highly expressed 
tumor cells. kaposi's sarcoma (ks), frequent tumor acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (aids) patients (aids-ks), arises disorder new blood 
vessel formation (angiogenesis), may evolve aggressive cancer,
characterized proliferation invasion spindle-shaped,
endothelial-like cells (ks cells, ksc). report primary ksc express
low telomerase levels strongly enhanced ks initiation and
progression factors including inflammatory mediators interleukin (il)-1beta, 
tumor necrosis factor (tnf)alpha interferon (ifn)gamma, angiogenic basic 
fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) tat protein human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv)-1. noteworthy, increase telomerase activity promoted 
molecules parallels induction ksc growth invasion. preliminary
in vitro findings encourage measuring telomerase activity aids-ks lesions in
order survey clinical progression disease.
