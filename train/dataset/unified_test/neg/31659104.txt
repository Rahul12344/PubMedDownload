background/aim: proteomics invasiveness opens window complexity of
the metastasis-engaged mechanisms. extend types complexity
require elucidation.
materials methods: proteomics, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, network 
analysis systems cancer biology used analyse acquisition of
invasiveness human breast adenocarcinoma cells.
results: report invasiveness network highlighted involvement 
hallmarks cell proliferation, migration, cell death, genome stability,
immune system regulation metabolism. identified involvement cell-virus
interaction gene silencing potentially novel cancer mechanisms.
identified 6,113 nodes 11,055 edges affecting 1,085 biological processes
show extensive re-arrangements cell physiology. high numbers line
with similar broadness networks built diagnostic signatures approved
for clinical use.
conclusion: data emphasize broad systemic regulation invasiveness, and
describe network regulation.
