leukocyte common antigens (lcas, also known t200 cd 45) integral
membrane proteins expressed exclusively hematopoietic cells. molecules
exhibit varying molecular masses epitopes expressed different cell
types. determine genetic bases generation diversity, three
classes human lca cdna clones different near 5' ends 
isolated. differences arose result differential usage three
exons determined analysis genomic dna clone. furthermore,
northern blot analysis lca exon-specific probes demonstrates existence
of least two lca mrna forms generated differential splicing. 
a comparison human mouse lca protein sequences revealed marked
difference extracellular domain.
