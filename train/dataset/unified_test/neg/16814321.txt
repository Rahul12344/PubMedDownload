the structural functional relevance amino acid residues surrounding
cavities within hydrophobic core protein subunits form capsid
of parvoviruses investigated. several evolutionarily conserved,
hydrophobic residues delimit cavities capsid minute
virus mice replaced hydrophobic residues would affect the
size and/or shape cavity. four methylene-sized groups were
introduced, six groups removed, capsid assembly drastically
impaired. contrast, introduction removal three groups no
significant effect capsid assembly thermostability. however, many 
mutations affected capsid conformational transition needed viral
infectivity. replacement polar residues around largest cavity showed 
that capsid assembly requires carboxylate buried within cavity, both
aspartate glutamate structurally accepted. again, aspartate
allowed production infectious viruses, specific role in
encapsidation viral genome. observations provide evidence a
remarkable structural tolerance mutation hydrophobic core the
protein subunits viral capsid, involvement core residues and
internal cavities capsid functions needed infectivity.
