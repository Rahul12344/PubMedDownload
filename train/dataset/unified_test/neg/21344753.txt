nerve growth factor (ngf) mainly secreted neuroglia cells, can
exert biological effect receptors specific target cell
surface. ngf closely related neurocyte growth, differentiation and
apoptosis. neurotropic virus, hsv-1 easily lead neurocyte, neuroglia
cells death apoptosis. study, u251 human glioma cells chosen 
as target cells study change ngf receptors apoptosis
process hsv-1 infection. results showed u251 cells permissive to
hsv-1 replication. apoptosis process hsv-1 infected u251 cells, the
expression ngf p75ntr increased decreased, the
expression trka decreased gradually. result indicated hsv-1 was
able induce abnormal expression ngf receptors u251 cells.
