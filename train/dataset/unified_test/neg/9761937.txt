both marijuana retroviruses impair natural killer (nk) cell functions. no
data simulataneous effects available. similarities human aids
induced early friend leukemia complex (flc) replication competent
helper rowson-parr virus (rpv) provides mouse model study drug-virus action.
leukemia susceptible balb/c resistant c57bl/6 mice infected, at
time intervals nylon wool-separated splenocytes exposed to
tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) 3h. natural killer (nk) cell activity against
yac-1 cells assayed 51cr-release 4 18h. recovery splenocytes
was found suppressed flc, balb/c rpv. transient
enhancement c57bl/6 flc, nk cell activity mice became suppressed
early (2 4 days), normalized subsequently enhanced late (11 14 days)
postinfection. moderate increase balb/c, change c57bl/6 induced
by low (1-2.5 microgram/ml) thc doses. nk cell activity balb/c became
suppressed exponentially higher (5-10 microgrtam/ ml) thc doses 18h as
compared 4h assays, proportional moderate impairment seen in
c57bl/6. magnitude nk cell activity infected mice determined by
thc: enhancement impairment followed untreated, infected
counterparts, level thc-treated cells. low doses hardly, high doses
additively influenced nk cells infected balb/c. thc hardly affected early
and late enhancement nk cell activiy flc infected c57bl/6, augmented
rpv induced suppression late 18h assays. genetic factors similar endotoxin 
resistance, altered cytokine profile might determine effects. similar
phenomena humans might result earlier manifestation aids.
