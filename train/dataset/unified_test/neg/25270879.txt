the use rna interference becoming routine scientific discovery and
treatment human disease. however, applications hampered unwanted
effects, particularly off-targeting mirna-like pathways. recent studies
suggest efficacy off-targeting might dependent binding
stability. here, testing shrnas sirnas various gc content different 
guide strand segments reporter assays, establish weak base pairing
in seed 3' regions required achieve minimal off-targeting while
maintaining intended on-target activity. reduced off-targeting was
confirmed rna-seq analyses mouse liver rnas expressing various anti-hcv
shrnas. finally, protocol validated large scale analyzing results
of genome-wide shrna screen. compared previously established work, new
algorithm effective reducing off-targeting without jeopardizing
on-target potency. studies provide new rules significantly
improve sirna/shrna design.
