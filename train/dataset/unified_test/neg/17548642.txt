human neutrophil peptides (hnps) released granules neutrophils in
response various activating stimuli participate killing of
bacteria stimulation various inflammatory responses. hnps also inhibit
infectivity enveloped viruses, including influenza virus (iav). this
study, demonstrate hnps increase uptake iav bacteria by
neutrophils. dimeric hnps also induced aggregation iav bacterial
particles, may, part, explain ability increase uptake. hnps did
not increase neutrophil respiratory burst responses iav. recently
demonstrated direct interactions hnps surfactant protein (sp-d),
another important effector innate immunity antimicrobial host defense.
although hnps alter sp-d-dependent uptake iav, counteracted the
ability sp-d increase iav-induced neutrophil h2o2 generation. studies
reveal previously unappreciated functional effects hnps, expand our
understanding antiviral properties hnps, suggest important
interactions collectins hnps host response viruses and
bacteria.
