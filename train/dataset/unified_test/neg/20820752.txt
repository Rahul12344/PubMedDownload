recognition pathogenic microbes innate immune system based the
principle pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps). conserved 
molecular structures present pathogen host. cells 
of innate immune system or, cases, virtually cells body
express receptors able specifically recognize pamps trigger the
appropriate responses including production cytokines. case of
viruses, interesting complication exists: viruses use host's cellular
metabolism building blocks replicate. consequence, protein
modifications, lipid carbohydrate configurations restricted viruses 
exist. instead, parts innate immune system evolved detect viral
nucleic acids mainly virtue (non-physiological) localization and
structure. understanding molecules involved anti-viral defence the
patterns recognize allow harnessing therapeutic strategies
targeting viral autoimmune diseases tumours. review presents
important recent advances understanding intracellular recognition nucleic
acid patterns innate immune system.
