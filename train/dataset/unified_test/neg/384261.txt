perinatal viral carcinogenesis: role immunity.

ioachim hl.

the perinatal period cumulates conditions favorable carcinogenesis that
comprise high cellular multiplication rates, unstable homeostasis, immune
incompetence. placenta allows passage various antigens including
oncogenic viruses immunogenic tolerogenic effects fetus.
according structural type different species, placenta also
transfers diversity maternal antibodies protect efficiently unborn 
progeny. however, postnatal period, infant deprived maternal
antibodies still incompetent produce sufficient levels immunoglobulins 
is highly susceptible viral carcinogenesis. experimental system, newborn
rats totally protected viral leukemogenesis prenatal immunization
of mothers either live inactivated leukemia virus. routes transfer
and comparative efficiency serum milk immunoglobulins different
classes neutralize virus examined. passage antibodies under
conditions maternal immunosuppression also studied.
