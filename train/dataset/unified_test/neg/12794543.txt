to evaluate relationship cell turnover, immune activation, cd4 
recovery hiv infection, 32 antiretroviral-naive hiv-1-infected patients were
studied initiation highly active antiretroviral therapy
(haart). elevated cd4 cd8 cell turnover (measured ki67) hiv infection
decreased haart blood lymphoid tissue. increased peripheral cd4 t
cell turnover strongly associated immune activation even viral
suppression less 50 copies/ml (r = 0.8; p <.001). increased cd4 cell
turnover correlated strongly cd4 cell counts (r = -0.6; p <.001)
and (r = -0.4; p =.05) haart. patients baseline cd4 cell counts 
less 350/microl, decreases cd4 cell turnover haart significantly
correlated increases cd4 cell counts. addition, persistently elevated 
levels cd4 cell turnover haart associated incomplete cd4 t
cell recovery despite hiv rna levels less 50 copies/ml. data
suggest immune activation central cd4 cell depletion hiv infection 
and immune reconstitution haart.
