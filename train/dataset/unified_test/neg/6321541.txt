culture medium host system choice virus isolation replication.
a cell culture immunofluorescence test ma104 cells used in
microtiter plates effective detecting assaying rotaviruses. a
plaque reduction neutralization test, cross-protection studies gnotobiotic
pigs, electrophoresis rotaviral double-stranded rna used for
comparing viruses. three strains produced plaques initial isolation attempts, 
replicated well cell cultures, antigenically similar. suggest
that three strains considered porcine rotavirus serotype 1, the
ohio state university (osu) strain serving prototype. osu strain was
distinct bovine, simian, canine, human (wa m) rotaviruses plaque 
reduction neutralization. four strains produce plaques initial
isolation attempts, difficult adapt cell cultures, related to
each distinct serotype 1 strains. suggest the
gottfried (g) strain tentatively considered prototype porcine
rotavirus serotype 2. g strain antigenically closely related canine
and simian rotaviruses less human rotavirus (human rotavirus serotype
3). canine, simian, human rotaviruses closely related. seven
porcine rotavirus strains caused diarrhea gnotobiotic pigs. cell-cultured
vaccines osu g strains caused mild diarrhea gnotobiotic 
pigs, protection occurred pigs challenged homologous, bur
not heterologous, virulent viruses. survey indicated 94% 274 porcine
serum samples 100% 75 herds serologically positive porcine osu
rotavirus.
