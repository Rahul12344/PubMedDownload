to increase safety efficacy human immunodeficiency virus vaccines,
several groups conducted studies using macaque model single-cycle
replicating simian immunodeficiency viruses (sivs). however, constructs had
poor diminished efficacy compared live attenuated vaccines. previously
showed immunization macaques live attenuated siv deletion 
the nef gene expressing gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) results significantly
enhanced safety efficacy. enhance safety, constructed and
characterized single-cycle sivs, pseudotyped glycoprotein vesicular
stomatitis virus, expressing different levels macaque ifn-gamma. expression of
ifn-gamma alter infectivity antigenicity pseudotyped siv. the
transduction dendritic cells (dcs) ifn-gamma-expressing particles resulted 
in up-regulation costimulatory major histocompatibility complex
molecules. furthermore, cells primed dcs transduced siv particles
expressing high levels ifn-gamma stimulated siv induced
significantly higher numbers spot-forming cells enzyme-linked immunospot
assay cells primed dcs transduced siv particles lacking 
cytokine. conclusion, demonstrated transduction dcs vitro
with pseudotyped single-cycle sivs expressing ifn-gamma increased dc activation
and augmented t-cell priming activity.
