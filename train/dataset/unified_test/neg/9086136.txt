herpes simplex viruses (hsvs) infect epithelial cells, become localized in
neurons, reactivate response variety stimuli, including
ultraviolet light hyperthermia. sequence gene activation viral 
replication known, molecular linkage exogenous stimuli hsv
reactivation determined. hypothesized interleukin (il)-6
acts signal exogenous stimuli neurons, stimulating hsv
reactivation latency. mouse corneas infected hsv-1, ocular
reactivation induced 5-7 weeks later thermal stress corneal exposure to
ultraviolet light. anti-il-6 monoclonal antibodies administered the
latently infected mice 8-12 h reactivation stimulus. treatment with
anti-il-6 antibodies resulted significantly lower frequencies ocular
reactivation compared mice treated control immunoglobulin.
these results support hypothesis il-6 plays role hsv reactivation
from latency.
