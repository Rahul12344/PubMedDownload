the inhibitory effects extract blackcurrant (ribes nigrum l.)
against pathogens associated oral, nasopharyngeal upper respiratory
infectious diseases; namely respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza virus 
and b (ifv-a ifv-b), adenovirus (adv), herpes simplex virus type 1,
haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae streptococcus mutans,
were investigated. less 1% concentration extract blackcurrant
inhibited replication rsv, ifv-a -b hsv-1 50% 10%
extract inhibited adsorption viruses onto cell surface 95%. 
the effects adv much less pronounced; half minimal inhibitory
concentration adv replication 2.54 ± 0.26, 10% concentration 
extract inhibited adv adsorption cell surface 72.9 ± 3.4%. the
antibacterial activities blackcurrant evaluated based efficacy
as disinfectant. 10% extract disinfected 99.8% h. influenzae type b and
78.9% s. pneumoniae 10 min, demonstrable effect s.
mutans. blackcurrant extract still showed antiviral antibacterial
activities ph made neutral sodium hydroxide, suggesting
that activities result acidic reactions components
precipitated neutral ph. findings demonstrate potential of
blackcurrant extract functional food oral care.
