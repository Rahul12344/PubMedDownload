advances hiv-1 vaccine clinical trials preclinical research indicate 
the virus envelope glycoproteins (env) likely essential component of
a prophylactic vaccine. efficient ag uptake presentation dendritic cells
(dcs) important strong cd4(+) th cell responses development of
effective humoral immune responses. study, examined capacity of
distinct primary human dc subsets internalize present recombinant env to
cd4(+) cells. consistent specific receptor expression, skin dcs
bound internalized env via c-type lectin receptors, whereas blood dc subsets,
including cd1c(+) myeloid dcs, cd123(+) plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs), cd141(+) dcs
exhibited restricted repertoire c-type lectin receptors relied cd4
for uptake env. despite generally poor capacity ag uptake compared 
myeloid dcs, high expression cd4 pdcs allowed bind and
internalize env efficiently. cd4-mediated uptake delivered env eea1(+)
endosomes progressed lamp1(+) mhc class ii(+) lysosomes where
internalized env degraded rapidly. finally, three blood dc subsets were
able internalize env-cmv pp65 fusion protein via cd4 stimulate
pp65-specific cd4(+) cells. thus, vitro systems described this
paper, cd4-mediated uptake env functional pathway leading ag
presentation, may therefore mechanism used blood dcs, including 
pdcs, generating immune responses env-based vaccines.
