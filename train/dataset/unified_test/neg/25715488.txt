aim: retrospectively analyze medical records patients died
from complications community-acquired pneumonia (cap) caused adenovirus
serotype 7.
subjects methods: cap diagnosed patients (6 men aged 19-24 years 1
woman aged 49 years) basis clinical, laboratory, radiological
findings. adenoviral pneumonia established real-time polymerase chain
reaction (pcr). adenovirus dna detected patients' autopsy samples
(lungs, brain, spleen, liver, blood). adenoviruses referred b1
serotype 7 basis hexone gene sequencing results. potential
causative agents pneumonia excluded battery molecular genetic
tests wide range viral bacterial pathogens acute respiratory
tract infections.
results: cases, disease began acutely fever (37.8 39 Â°c),
weakness, headache, sore throat, dry, unproductive cough runny nose.
clinical deterioration symptomatic therapy led hospital admission for
cap disease days 2-11. patients continued feel worse massive
antibiotic therapy, switching drug one six times simultaneously
using 2-4 antibiotics intensive therapy. death occurred disease days
10-24. postmortem examination patients revealed acute respiratory
distress syndrome multiple organ failure.
conclusion: adenovirus pneumonia causes diagnostic therapeutic problems for
clinicians. clinical introduction pcr methods diagnosis viral
infections allow clinicians elaborate timely use effective management 
tactics patients adenoviral pneumonia prevent death. is
necessary design etiotropic therapy agents introduce specific
prevention adenovirus infection risk groups.
