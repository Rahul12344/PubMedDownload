the prevalence htlv-iii/lav antibodies evaluated 222 italian
asymptomatic hemophiliacs treated exclusively commercial factor concentrates
made american plasma. increase htlv-iii/lav seropositivity 1983
to 1985 evident. independent type hemophilia (a b) 
directly correlated amount concentrate administered previous
year. immunological data (t4 t8 lymphocyte subsets) evaluated in
relation seropositivity htlv-iii/lav. presence antibodies found 
to significantly associated low t4/t8 ratio reduced t4
subpopulation, whereas increased levels t8 lymphocytes correlated weakly 
seropositivity. data 47 hemophiliacs tested 1984 1985 showed
that 100% negative 1984 highly transfused previous year
seroconverted 1985, whereas 33% highly transfused so.
