steroid 21-hydroxylase key enzyme glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid
biosynthesis adrenal gland belongs family microsomal
cytochrome p450. steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency frequent cause
of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. human steroid 21-hydroxylase (cyp21 a)
and mutant variant (c 169r) found previously patient classical
congenital adrenal hyperplasia synthesized first time insect 
cell lines sf9 hi5 infected recombinant baculoviruses. optimal
conditions level cyp21a2 production insect cells achieves 28% the
total microsomal protein. c169r mutation effect synthesis cyp21
a2 insect cells prevent incorporation enzyme 
membranes endoplasmic reticulum. functional analysis mutant enzyme in
vitro suggested virtually complete lack catalytic activity towards two
substrates - progesterone 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
