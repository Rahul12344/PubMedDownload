the development clinical vectors correct genetic mutations cause
inherited myopathies related disorders skeletal muscle advancing 
impressive rate. adeno-associated virus vectors attractive clinical use
because (1) adeno-associated viruses cause human disease (2) these
vectors able persist years. new vectors becoming available 
gene therapy delivery tools, recent preclinical experiments demonstrated
the feasibility, safety, efficacy gene therapy adeno-associated virus
for long-term correction muscle pathology weakness in
myotubularin-deficient canine murine disease models. review, recent
advances application gene therapies treat inherited muscle disorders
are presented, including duchenne muscular dystrophy x-linked myotubular
myopathy. potential areas therapeutic synergies rehabilitation
medicine genetics also discussed.
