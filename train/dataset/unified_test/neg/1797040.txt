besides rapid diagnostic tests based influenza b antigens
nucleoproteins detection, routinely used, isolation influenza
strains still required obtain recent variant isolates full antigenic
characterization, order up-date influenza vaccine composition. to
increase rapidity efficacy virus growth, implemented a
culture test 24-well plates centrifugation samples llcmk2 cells in
the presence trypsin. test routinely applied 331 nasopharyngeal
swabs collected influenza outbreak winters 1988-1989 to
962 1989-1990. centrifugation culture assay compared the
direct detection np antigens clinical samples immunofluorescence and
capture elisa tests conventional virus isolation inoculation of
the samples embryonated eggs llcmk2 cell cultures. compared np
antigen detection tests, centrifugation culture assay closely correlated (r =
0.95) sensitivity specificity also excellent, 93.4% 99.6%,
respectively. compared conventional culture assays, centrifugation
culture markedly increased performance (five times) rapidity (2 days) 
influenza virus isolation identification.
