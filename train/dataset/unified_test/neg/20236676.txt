the amino acid sequence viral capsid proteins contains information their
folding, structure self-assembly processes. viruses assemble 
small preformed oligomers coat proteins, viruses phage p22 and
herpesvirus assemble monomeric proteins (fuller king, 1980; newcomb et
al., 1999). subunit assembly process strictly controlled through
protein:protein interactions icosahedral structures formed with
specific symmetries, rather aberrant structures. dsdna viruses commonly
assemble first forming precursor capsid serves dna packaging
machine (earnshaw, hendrix, king, 1980; heymann et al., 2003). dna packaging 
is accompanied conformational transition small precursor procapsid
into larger capsid isometric viruses. highlight pseudo-atomic
structures phage p22 coat protein rationalize several decades data
about p22 coat protein folding, assembly maturation generated a
combination genetics biochemistry.
