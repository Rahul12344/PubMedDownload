background: rhinovirus infection responsible considerable morbidity and
mortality major cause exacerbations asthma, also known to
induce exacerbations cystic fibrosis chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. exacerbations diseases also frequently associated with
bacterial atypical bacterial infection. alveolar macrophages major
immune cells airways important defence bacterial
infections.
methods: authors investigated whether rhinovirus modifies cytokine release,
the pattern recognition receptor expression phagocytosis human alveolar
macrophages response bacterial products.
results: viable rhinovirus detected macrophages 3 days after
exposure viral rna expression persisted 10 days. infectious uv
inactivated rhinovirus increased tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) and
interleukin (il)8 release macrophages. contrast, infectious rhinovirus
impaired lipopolysaccharide lipoteichoic acid induced tnfalpha il8
secretion macrophages. rhinovirus induced impairment macrophage
antibacterial immune responses involve il10, prostaglandin e(2) or
downregulation toll-like receptor 2. furthermore, macrophage phagocytic
response labelled bacterial particles, latex beads, impaired.
conclusion: authors identified impairment cytokine responses to
bacterial lipopolysaccharide lipoteichoic acid alveolar macrophages in
response infectious rhinovirus. virus induced impairment antibacterial host
defence important implications pathogenesis exacerbations of
respiratory diseases.
