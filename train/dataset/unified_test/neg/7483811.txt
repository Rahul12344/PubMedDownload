the mucosal immune response soluble antigens administered directly the
mucosal system low requires large amount antigen frequent
vaccinations. study tested whether immunizing cattle site which
shares lymphatic drainage nasal mucosa could prime local mucosal
immunity. tested whether recombinant bovine il-1 beta (rboil-1 beta)
could potentiate induction mucosal immunity. animals immunized
subcutaneously base ear (s.e.) recombinant bovine
herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1) envelope glycoprotein (gi) (35 micrograms animal-1)
emulsified incomplete freund's adjuvant without rboil-1 beta (500 ng
kg-1) followed second immunization 42 days later. animals challenged
with virulent bhv-1 intranasally 42 days second immunization. mucosal
iga nares induced one immunization, enhanced by
boosting. rboil-1 beta treated animals higher levels bhv-1 specific nasal 
iga (p < 0.01) serum neutralizing antibody (p < 0.05). rboil-1 beta-treated
animals also increased numbers surface iga+ (p < 0.05) igg1+ (p <
0.001) b cells vitro antigen (gi) stimulation peripheral blood
lymphocytes suggesting greater expension iga+ igg1+ b
cells rboil-1 beta treated animals. challenged bhv-1, 3 4 animals
in gi+rboil-1 beta group fully protected viral replication the
nares, 1 4 animals receiving gi alone protected.(abstract
