the intasome basic recombination unit retroviral integration,
comprising integrase protein ends viral dna made reverse
transcription. clinical inhibitors preferentially target dna-bound form of
integrase compared free protein, highlighting critical
requirement detailed understanding hiv-1 intasome structure function. 
although previous biochemical studies identified integrase residues contact 
the dna, structural details protein-protein protein-dna interactions
within functional intasome lacking. recent crystal structure 
prototype foamy virus (pfv) integrase-viral dna complex revealed numerous details
of related integration machine. structures drug-bound pfv intasomes
moreover elucidated mechanism inhibitor action. herein present model 
for hiv-1 intasome assembled using pfv structure template. results
pinpoint previously identified protein-dna contacts within quaternary
structure reveal hitherto unknown roles arg20 lys266 dna binding
and integrase function. models clinical inhibitors bound hiv-1
integrase active site also constructed compared previous studies.
our findings highlight structural basis hiv-1 integration define 
mechanism inhibition, help formulating new drugs to
inhibit viruses resistant first-in-class compounds.
