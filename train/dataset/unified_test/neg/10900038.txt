the e1 protein bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv-1) origin recognition 
protein essential initiation viral dna replication. reported
previously conserved motif residues 25 60 all
papillomavirus e1 proteins resembles casein kinase ii (ckii)
phosphorylation site. corresponding serine bpv-1, serine-48, an
efficient substrate ckii vitro. examine functional role this
potential phosphorylation site, three amino acid substitutions constructed
at serine-48. conversion serine-48 glycine (s48g) resulted bpv-1
genome unable replicate reduced transformation capacity. 
s48g e1 protein also failed support replication bpv-1 origin-containing
plasmid expressed heterologous vector rather viral genome,
indicating direct replication defect. contrast, conversion serine-48 to
acidic residues (s48d s48e), mimic charge structure of
phosphoserine, maintained wild-type replication phenotype. mutational
results consistent replication requirement negative charge at
serine-48, presumably supplied vivo phosphorylation. mechanistic basis 
for negative charge requirement examined testing several activities of
the s48g mutant e1 protein vivo using yeast one- two-hybrid systems. no
gross defect observed stability, origin binding interaction e2 or
for e1-e1 interaction, although subtle defects activities would not
likely detected. overall, results suggest important phosphoregulatory
control e1 replication function mediated n-terminal region of
this protein.
