equine herpesvirus-1 (ehv-1) causes respiratory disease, neonatal death, abortion
and neurologic disease. main purpose study identify viral
antigen respiratory tract samples immunoperoxidase staining. six pony foals
were selected basis demonstrating seronegativity ehv-1 virus
neutralization housed isolation. infected experimentally by
administering ehv-1 nebulized ultrasonically face mask. successful
infection clinically apparent foals febrile responses,
nasal discharge, enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. sporadic coughing was
also heard. ehv-1 isolated nasopharyngeal swabs 4/6 ponies and
seroconversion demonstrated foals. bronchoscopic examination the
large airways revealed hyperemia. incidence recovery actinobacillus
suis nasopharyngeal swabs increased initially, recovery of
streptococcus zooepidemicus isolates predominating 3 wk post-infection.
cytology brushes used sequentially sample respiratory tract the
infected ponies nasopharynx, mid-trachea mainstem bronchus.
bronchoalveolar lavage provided lung cells. immunocytochemistry techniques were
applied types samples locate ehv-1 antigen. indirect
immunoperoxidase staining samples utilizing monoclonal antibodies specific for
ehv-1 demonstrated viral antigen associated cellular debris, primarily in
the nasopharyngeal samples days 3-9 post-infection.
