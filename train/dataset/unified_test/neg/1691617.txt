chemotherapeutic agents affect integration, stability, inducibility 
of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) provirus would considerable value 
in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. two nucleoside analogs of
cytosine, 5-azacytidine 5-azadeoxycytidine, seem value
because capabilities affect stability methylation
patterns nucleic acids incorporated, tested for
their ability inhibit replication hiv type 1 (hiv-1) human cem t
cells vitro. 5-azadeoxycytidine (1 microm) completely inhibited hiv
replication cem cells, criteria reduced viral antigen expression and
decreased supernatant reverse transcriptase activity, little toxicity for
the treated cells. 5-azacytidine (1 microm) also inhibited hiv replication, but
less effectively. added 2 h cem cells infected with
hiv-1, 5-azacytosine derivatives less effective when
added time infection. even 2 h exposure 5-azadeoxycytidine was
sufficient inhibition hiv replication. although long exposure either
analog concentrations 1 microm would result pronounced cellular
cytotoxicity, fact short exposures dose drug inhibit 
hiv replication toxic cells implies cellular toxicity
itself important mechanism antiviral action analogs.
