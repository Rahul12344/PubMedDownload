background: cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (synonymous idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis) clinically heterogeneous condition the
precipitating factor unclear. environmental infective factors have
been implicated. association epstein-barr virus (ebv) cryptogenic 
fibrosing alveolitis suggested decade ago study based ebv
serology, significance unclear.
methods: lung tissue obtained surgically patients (n = 20) cryptogenic 
fibrosing alveolitis investigated evidence ebv replication and
compared lung tissue 21 control patients. fourteen 20 patients
had received specific therapy cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis time
of biopsy. monoclonal antibodies directed ebv viral antigens, ebv
viral capsid antigen (vca) gp 340/220 antigen, expressed the
lytic phase ebv life cycle, studied.
results: fourteen (70%) 20 patients cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis 
were positive ebv vca gp 340/220 compared two (9%) 21
controls. patients cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis viral replication
was localised pulmonary epithelial cells using epithelial cell markers, and
immunohistochemical analysis confirmed staining within type ii alveolar
cells.
conclusions: first report vivo ebv replication within
epithelial cells lower respiratory tract immunocompetent human host.
furthermore, suggests ebv may immune trigger contribute to
lung injury cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, thus offering potential new
avenue treatment.
