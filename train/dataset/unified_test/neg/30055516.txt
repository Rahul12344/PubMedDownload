the foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid precursor, p1-2a, cleaved 3c
protease (3cpro) vp0, vp3, vp1 2a. p1-2a precursor (wt mutant) 
expressed alone 3cpro processing p1-2a determined. vp2
k217r vp3 i2p substitutions (near vp0/vp3 junction) strongly reduced 
processing junction 3cpro substitution vp2 k217e blocked
cleavage. vp3/vp1 junction, substitutions vp3 q2221p vp1 t1p 
severely inhibited processing site. blocking cleavage either junction 
did prevent processing elsewhere p1-2a. modifications also
introduced full-length fmdv rna; wt vp2 k217r mutant were
viable. uncleaved vp0-vp3 processed products observed within cells
infected mutant virus. vp0-vp3 incorporated empty
capsids virus particles. three junctions within p1-2a processed by
3cpro independently.
