the core complex structure involved fusion mechanism many viruses,
as well intracellular vesicle fusion. powerful approach studying 
dynamic stages hiv-1-cell fusion utilizes dp178, core complex inhibitory
peptide derived known sequence virus. strikingly, show that
fatty acids replace entire c-terminal region dp178, known play a
crucial role activity peptide. inhibitory activity correlated
with length fatty acid, direction fatty acid attachment
(n- c-terminus) and, envisioned new triple staining assay, the
concentration peptides cells. findings indicate, first
time, c-terminal boundary endogenous core structure situ and
establish c-terminal region dp178 functions mainly anchor to
the cell membrane. apart mechanistic implications, short
lipopeptides provide new, promising fusion inhibitors. fusion
mechanism hiv-1 shared pathogen-enveloped viruses by
intracellular vesicle fusion, results might influence research and
therapeutic efforts systems well.
