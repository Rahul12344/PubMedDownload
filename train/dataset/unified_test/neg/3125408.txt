we determined upper size limit dna packaging bacillus subtilis
bacteriophage phi 105 examining plaque-forming transducing
capabilities lysates made strains containing prophages various sizes. 
the upper size limit efficient packaging phage genome appears be
about 40.2 kb, 1 kb larger wild-type genome. places 
an upper limit 5 kb size insertions accommodated
in phi 105 transfection cloning vectors, phi 105j27. induction of
prophages exceed upper limit, followed selection plaque
formation transduction, provides powerful means isolating phage deletion 
mutants. comparison location deletion resultant
phenotype enabled us identify non-essential regions phage genome,
and regions required tail biosynthesis host cell lysis.
