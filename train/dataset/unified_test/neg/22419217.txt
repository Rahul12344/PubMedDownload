previously, studied aavs1 site-specific non-viral integration system a
rep-donor plasmid plasmid containing adeno-associated virus integration
element. earlier study focused plasmid vector itself, cellular
response system still unknown. sp100 member promyelocytic 
leukemia nuclear bodies. involved many cellular processes as
transcriptional regulation cellular intrinsic immune response against
viral infection. study, revealed sp100 inhibited the
rep-dependent nonviral integration. conversely, transient expression rep78
increased degradation sp100. degradation inhibited treatment
with mg132, inhibitor ubiquitin proteasome. sp100 rep78 both
located nucleolus, provides spatial possibility their
interaction. rep78 coimmunoprecipitated enhanced green fluorescent
protein (egfp)-sp100 fusion protein egfp, verified interaction 
between rep78 sp100. results enriched knowledge the
cellular protein sp100 rep-dependent nonviral integration. may lead 
improvement application rep-related transgene integration method in
the selection target cells.
