during last decade, burst interest observed antidiabetic
biguanide metformin candidate drug cancer chemoprevention. analysis of
the available data shown efficacy cancer preventive effect of
metformin (mf) another biguanides, buformin (bf) phenformin (pf), has
been studied relation total tumor incidence 17 target organs, 21 
various strains mice, 4 strains rats 1 strain hamsters (inbred,
outbred, transgenic, mutant), spontaneous (non- exposed carcinogenic
agent) induced 16 chemical carcinogens different classes (polycyciic
aromatic hydrocarbons, nitroso compounds, estrogen, etc.), direct indirect
(need metabolic transformation proximal carcinogen), total body x-rays
and Î³- irradiation, viruses, genetic modifications special high fat diet,
using one stage two-stage protocols carcinogenesis, 5 routes the
administration antidiabetic biguanides (oral gavage, intraperitoneal or
subcutaneous injections, drinking water diet) wide ranks of
doses treatment regimens. majority cases (86%) treatment with
biguanides leads inhibition carcinogenesis. 14% cases inhibitory 
effect drugs observed. important case
of stimulation carcinogenesis antidiabetic biguanides. conclude that
there sufficient experimental evidence anti-carcinogenic effect of
antidiabetic biguanides.
