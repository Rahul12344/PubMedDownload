solid phase cytometry would asset many histological cytological
studies. current microscope-based cytometers image analysis systems too
slow analyze specimens several millimeters wide. recently shown a
rapid wide area laser scanning device operates solid supports a
linear response. assess solid phase cytometry. cell detected 
by cytometer automatically positioned visual observation the
field epifluorescence microscope (conventional confocal) the
stage driven instrument's computer. able detect map
human papillomavirus-infected cells labeled fluorescent situ hybridization 
in cervical condyloma biopsies. could quantify fluorescence emitted by
these cells show differences 35-fold fluorescence intensity
between individual cells. differences intensity might reflect
differences viral copy number. potential system provide fast,
reliable reproducible analyses solid tissue samples discussed.
