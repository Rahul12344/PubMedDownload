the nasopharynx small, tubular structure soft palate connects
the nose oropharynx. cancers arise area usually
squamous cell carcinomas behave differently head neck
cancers. common place origin fossa rosenmuller, the
pharyngeal recess. virus-related oncogenesis common theme head/neck
cancers. oropharyngeal cancers associated human papillomavirus
(hpv) infection, nasopharyngeal cancers (npc) associated with
ebstein-barr virus (ebv). exact pathogenesis still unknown. however viral 
oncogenes lmp-1, lmp-2, ebna1 known play important role. in
areas high incidence disease, cases related ebv infection. 
although hpv related nasopharyngeal cancers have also reported, clear
association established. clinical behavior of nasopharyngeal cancers
varies depending histological subtype. world health organization (who)
has classified nasopharyngeal carcinoma three subtypes based on
histology. type 1 keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma associated
with ebv infection around 70% 80% cases. type 2 differentiated
non-keratinizing carcinoma, type 3 undifferentiated nonkeratinizing
carcinoma common form of nasopharyngeal cancer. latter 2
types also responsive treatment. almost cases type 2 type 
3 related ebv occur area ebv endemic. nasopharyngeal
cancer with basaloid features newer, rarer histologic category, known to
behave aggressively. treatment vary based histologic subtypes. in
general, mortality related to nasopharyngeal cancers has improved last
decade owing early detection advances treatment.[1][2][3]
