ceramide, intracellular lipid mediator tumor necrosis factor alpha
(tnf-alpha) action, studied effects expression proviral
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome latently infected myelomonocytic
cell lines u-1iiib om-10.1. ceramide treatment resulted 20- 100-fold 
enhancement hiv production cells. ceramide also enhanced the
expression chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene directed human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat transfected u-937 cells,
indicating ceramide acts level viral transcription. these
observations suggest tnf-ceramide signaling system may involved in
the regulation hiv expression certain myeloid cell types.
