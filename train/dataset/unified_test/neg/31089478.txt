middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) first emerged late
2012. since emergence, total 2279 patients 27 countries been
infected across globe according world health organization (who) report
(feb. 12th, 2019). approximately 806 patients died. virus uses spike
proteins adhesive factors proinflammatory host entry a
specific receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp4). receptor is
considered key factor signaling activation acquired and
innate immune responses infected patients. using potent antigens in
combination strong adjuvants may effectively trigger activation of
specific mers-cov cellular responses well production neutralizing
antibodies. unfortunately, date, effective approved treatment or
vaccine mers-cov. thus, urgent needs development novel
mers-cov therapies well vaccines help minimize spread virus
from infected patients, thereby mitigating risk potential pandemics.
our main goals highlight describe current knowledge the
innate adaptive immune responses mers-cov current state of
mers-cov vaccine development. believe study increase our
understanding mechanisms enhance mers-cov immune response and
subsequently contribute control mers-cov infections.
