feline morbillivirus (femv), novel virus family paramyxoviridae,
was first identified stray cat populations. objectives current
study (i) determine molecular prevalence femv malaysia; (ii)
identify risk factors associated femv infection; (iii) characterise 
femv isolates phylogenetic analyses. molecular analysis utilising nested
rt-pcr assay targeting l gene femv performed either urine, blood and/or
kidney samples collected 208 cats study revealed 82 (39.4%) positive
cats. femv-positive samples obtained 63/124 (50.8%) urine 20/25
(80.0%) kidneys blood samples negative femv. addition, from
the 35 cats one type samples collected (blood urine;
blood kidney; blood, urine kidney), one cat femv rna the
urine kidney samples. risk factors gender, presence of
kidney-associated symptoms cat source also investigated. male cats a
higher risk (p = 0.031) femv infection females. addition, no
significant association (p = 0.083) observed presence of
kidney-associated symptoms femv status. 82 positive samples, femv
rna detected 48/82 (58.5%) pet cats 34/126 (27.0%) shelter cats
(p < 0.0001). partial l n gene sequencing rt-pcr-positive samples
showed 85-99% identity published femv sequences significantly
different morbilliviruses. phylogenetic analysis the
identified malaysian femvs performed isolates japan, thailand and
china. molecular characterisation revealed high relatedness malaysian
isolates asian femvs, indicating virus circulating
only within region. therefore, study confirmed existence femv
among domestic cats malaysia. findings suggest characterisation of
the local isolates, including whole genome sequencing studies at
determining direct consequences femv infection domestic cats are
needed.
