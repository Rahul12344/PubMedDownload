details procedure detecting double-stranded rna (dsrna) virus and
viroid infected tissue extracts using serologically specific electron microscopy 
are given. method staining dsrna, based situ formation uranyl
phosphate, consistently permits examination dsrna electron
microscopy without shadowing heavy metals, described. method provides
for routine assays dsrna crude extracts without variable results
associated shadowing procedures. dsrna found accumulate older
leaves sorghum systemically infected sugarcane mosaic virus. contrast,
dsrna detected older cowpea leaves systemically infected cowpea
mosaic virus readily found inoculated leaves 4 days post inoculation
and young systemically infected leaves.
