the feasibility using "clustered charge-to-alanine" mutagenesis (replacement
by alanine two charged residues clustered five- six-amino acid
sequence) create temperature-sensitive, conditionally lethal mutations in
vaccinia virus examined creating nine mutations vaccinia virus gene
g2r. g2r chosen analysis mutations gene confer
selectable phenotypes. specifically, vaccinia viruses contain wild-type
copy g2r nare sensitive effects anti-poxvirus drug
isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazone (ibt), mutations g2r completely
abolish function g2r protein product confer dependence upon ibt for
growth. previously isolated mutant carrying temperature-sensitive mutation
that maps g2r (cts56) resistant ibt permissive temperature and
dependent upon ibt restrictive temperature. nine clustered
charge-to-alanine mutants examined. four mutants (as1, as4,
as6, as9) display degree temperature sensitivity function of
the g2r gene product. as1 temperature sensitive growth plaque
assay one-step growth experiment. as6 as9 form small plaques 
nonpermissive temperature temperature sensitive growth one-step 
growth experiment. as4 manifests temperature sensitivity as
temperature-dependent ibt resistance. five mutations (as2, as3, as5, as7, 
and as8) appeared confer phenotypes indistinguishable wild-type
vaccinia. results demonstrate temperature-sensitive conditionally
lethal mutants created vaccinia virus altering charge
characteristics essential viral proteins.
