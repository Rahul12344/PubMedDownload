inhibition leukocyte trafficking via alpha4-integrin antibody blockade has
recently become validated therapeutic approach several inflammatory
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis crohn's disease.
in midst recent success, 3 patients receiving chronic treatment 
the anti-alpha4 antagonist natalizumab (tysabri) treatment multiple
sclerosis crohn's disease, developed jc-virus related progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (pml). unforeseen consequences suggest long term
blockade alpha4-integrins might prevent trafficking non-pathogenic
lymphocytes essential viral immunosurveillance. current issue
of european journal immunology bjursten colleagues report long
term treatment anti-alpha4-integrin antibodies results exacerbation of
the murine model colitis induced targeted deletion the
heterotrimeric g protein subunit galphai2. order properly evaluate the
efficacy safety anti-alpha4-integrin therapy, relationship between
these observations immunologically altered animal model human clinical 
disease needs carefully measured.
