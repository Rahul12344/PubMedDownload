the isolation retrovirus peripheral blood lymphocytes/monocytes 
a difficult task, requiring fulfillment three essential parameters. first,
this viral agent must infect cells vivo. second, circulating cells 
should harbor wild-type proviruses. finally, viral agent express, at
least cells cultured vitro, structural proteins necessary
for production viral particles. foamy viruses (fvs), also known as
spumaviruses, complex retroviruses whose genomic organization known 
since cloning prototypic primate foamy virus type 1. these
retroviruses infect cell lines culture, circulating lymphocytes seem 
to represent major reservoir vivo. fv infection leads formation
of multinucleated giant cells, resulting fusion adjacent infected
cells, present multiple vacuoles giving monolayer culture foam
aspect. two features, combined electron microscopy studies, have
helped investigators attempt isolate new fvs. viruses were
described isolated different animal species, mostly nonhuman
primates. present successive steps leading isolation the
equine foamy virus peripheral blood lymphocytes infected horses.
