carcinoma, and, recently, hodgkin's disease, t-cell lymphomas, and
gastric carcinoma, well causal agent infectious
mononucleosis. relation virus malignancies varies primary 
etiologic agent necessary contributory cofactor. clonal ebv episomes are
found malignant conditions. ebv infects epithelial lymphoid
cells, providing pathobiological basis diverse associations. 
the malignancies occur years viral dormancy accompanied or
triggered viral reactivation, contrast infectious mononucleosis, which
results primary infection ebv. ebv-associated malignancies offer
insights causation early detection cancer. molecular virology
and pathobiology ebv infection states provide basis specific
diagnosis diseases framework new therapies.
