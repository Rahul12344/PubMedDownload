previous studies suggested uukuniemi virus, bunyavirus, matures at
the membranes golgi complex. study employed
immunocytochemical techniques analyze detail budding compartment(s) 
the virus. electron microscopy infected bhk-21 cells showed virus
particles found cisternae throughout golgi stack. within the
cisternae, virus particles located preferentially dilated rims.
this would suggest virus budding may begin cis golgi
membranes. virus budding compartment studied immunoelectron
microscopy pre-golgi intermediate compartment marker, p58, golgi
stack marker protein, mannosidase ii (manii). virus particles budding virus
were detected manii-positive golgi stack membranes and, interestingly, both
juxtanuclear peripheral p58-positive elements intermediate
compartment. cells incubated 15 degrees c nucleocapsid virus
envelope proteins seen accumulate intermediate compartment.
immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated 15 degrees c nucleocapsid is
associated membranes show characteristic distribution and
tubulo-vesicular morphology pre-golgi intermediate compartment. these
membranes contained virus particles lumen. results indicate the
first site formation uukuniemi virus particles pre-golgi
intermediate compartment virus budding continues golgi stack. the
results raise questions intracellular transport pathway virus
particles, 100 120 nm diameter therefore large 
transported 60-nm-diameter vesicles postulated function the
intra-golgi transport. distribution virus golgi stack may imply
that cisternae role vectorial transport virus
particles.
