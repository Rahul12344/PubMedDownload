during past years, notion microdomains surface cellular
membranes developed. constituted lipid rafts involve 
sphingoglycolipids cholesterol. rafts associated proteins 
have lipid anchor transmembrane proteins. lipid rafts target
specific proteins plasma membrane surface remain associated with
them. present surface receptors endocytosis occurs upon binding
of specific ligands. thus rafts participate major aspects of
cellular dynamics. rafts complex structures, insoluble non-ionic
detergents. according detergent used, many types rafts isolated.
any alteration cholesterol, sphingoglycolipids, abnormalities the
proteins themselves, lead abnormal targeting membrane surface. it
is possible specific sphingoglycolipids necessary target specific
proteins membrane surface. may explain complexity the
sphingoglycolipid molecules, relation oligosaccharide to
their ceramide structures. cellular tissue specificity of
these constituents. complex sphingoglycolipids involved cellular
differentiation, cellular polarization, modified relation cancer. virus
and bacteria linked sphingoglycolipids microdomains and
alter cellular signaling function. sphingoglycolipids involved in
autoimmune diseases antibody targets neurolipidoses genetic
diseases involving catabolism. dynamics lipid rafts, relation
to cholesterol, altered niemann-pick's disease type c in
alzheimer's disease. thus microdomains involved many aspects related
to normal pathological cellular dynamics.
