construction genetically isogenic strains mycobacteria complicated by
poor recombination rates lack generalized transducing phages for
mycobacterium tuberculosis. report powerful method introducing
single point mutations mycobacterial genomes using oligonucleotide-derived
single-stranded dna recombineering mycobacteriophage-encoded proteins. phage 
che9c gp61-mediated recombination sufficiently efficient single base
changes introduced without requirement direct selection, isogenic
mutant strains identified simply pcr. efficient recombination requires only
short (50 nucleotide) oligonucleotides, unusually strong strand
bias oligonucleotide targeting lagging strand dna synthesis recombine 
more 10,000-fold efficiently complementary oligonucleotide. this
ssdna recombineering provides simple assay comparing activities of
related phage recombinases, find escherichia coli recet and
phage lambda red recombination proteins function inefficiently mycobacteria,
illustrating utility developing recombineering new bacterial systems
using host-specific bacteriophage recombinases. ssdna mycobacterial
recombineering provides simple approach characterizing antimycobacterial
drug targets, constructed characterized single point mutations
that confer resistance isoniazid, rifampicin, ofloxacin streptomycin.
