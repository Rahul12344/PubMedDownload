hepatotropic viruses hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv) 
are major etiological agents associated development hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc). progression hcc multistep process requires
sequential parallel deregulation oncogenic tumor suppressive pathways
leading chromosomal instability neoplastic phenotype. recent years,
micrornas (mirnas) carved niche alongside oncogenes tumor
suppressors, owing innate ability receive relay multiple signals.
not surprisingly, mirnas fast emerging central player myriads of
malignancies including hcc. mirnas reported participate initiation 
progression hcc, also clinically correlated risk
assessment, disease grade, aggressiveness, prognosis. despite extensive data 
available role mirnas hcc, pressing need integrate and
evaluate datasets find correlation, any, causal agents in
order devise novel interventional modalities. review, attempt 
to bridge gap consolidating current knowledge concepts the
field hcc-related mirnas special emphasis hbv hcv. further, we
assess potential common well unique signatures may useful in
developing novel biomarkers therapeutics.
