packaging cyclophilin (cypa) hiv-1 virions essential efficient
replication; however, reason unknown. incorporation mediated
through binding gly-89-pro-90 peptide bond n-terminal domain of
hiv-1 capsid (ca(n)). despite fact cypa peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans
isomerase, catalytic activity ca(n) observed previously. show 
here, using nmr exchange spectroscopy, cypa bind ca(n) 
also catalyzes efficiently cis/trans isomerization gly-89-pro-90
peptide bond. addition, conformational changes ca(n) distal cypa
binding loop observed cypa binding catalysis. results provide
experimental evidence efficient cypa catalysis natively folded and
biologically relevant protein substrate.
