the cytoplasmic tail immature moloney murine leukemia virus (momulv)
envelope protein approximately 32 amino acids long. viral maturation,
the viral protease cleaves tail release 16-amino-acid r peptide,
thereby rendering envelope protein fusion competent. series truncations,
deletions, amino acid substitutions constructed cytoplasmic tail
to examine role fusion viral transduction. sequential truncation of
the cytoplasmic tail revealed removal 11 amino acids resulted
in significant fusion envelope protein expressed nih 3t3 cells,
similar seen following expression r-less envelope (truncation 16
amino acids). truncation cytoplasmic tail beyond r-peptide
cleavage site toward membrane-spanning region additional effect the
level fusion observed. contrast, deletions nonconservative amino
acid substitutions membrane-proximal region cytoplasmic tail
(residues l602 f605) reduced amount fusion observed xc cell
cocultivation assays, suggesting region influences fusogenicity 
full-length envelope protein. expression mutant envelope proteins a
retroviral vector system revealed decreased envelope-mediated cell-cell
fusion correlated decrease infectivity resulting virions.
additionally, mutant envelope proteins capable mediating
cell-cell fusion efficiently incorporated retroviral particles,
resulting defective virions. cytoplasmic tail momulv envelope protein
therefore influences fusogenicity envelope protein its
incorporation virions.
