injecting drug users prisoners high prevalences antibodies to
hepatitis a-c. aim study determine prevalence of
antibodies hepatitis e virus (anti-hev) two danish high-risk populations
and correlate anti-hev risk factors transmission. three hundred thirty
male prisoners 137 patients drug treatment center tested for
anti-hev in-house enzyme-linked immunoassay (eia) utilizing antigens
derived open reading frame 2 (orf2). compared commercial
test antigens derived orf2 orf3 (abbott hev eia). addition the
samples tested antibodies hepatitis a-c viruses, human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 1 2, human lymphotropic virus (htlv) ii 
and herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv2). participants interviewed about
risk factors transmission. anti-hev prevalence 16.9% (95% ci 14-21)
for in-house assay compared 4.1% (95% ci 2.5-6.3) commercial
assay. correlation two assays low (87% overall agreement;
kappa value 0.32). one sample strongly anti-hev igm positive, suggesting
recent hev infection inside denmark. presence anti-hev associated
significantly anti-hav among prisoners increased age both
groups. contrast, associations found injecting drug use or
sexual risk factors. commercial assay increased prevalence of
anti-hev found among participants spent 5 years outside
northern europe. conclusion, anti-hev highly prevalent among danish
prisoners drug users related risk factors blood-borne or
sexual transmission.
