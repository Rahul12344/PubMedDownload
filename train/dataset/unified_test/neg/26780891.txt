this study conducted determine prevalence molecular
characteristics turkey astrovirus 1 (tastv-1) avian nephritis virus (anv) 
in turkeys light turkey syndrome (lts), characterized lower body
weight market-age turkeys standard breed character. collected
pools fecal samples four lts two non-lts turkey flocks minnesota
at 2, 3, 5 8 weeks age. 80 lts pools tested, 16 (20.0 %) 11
(13.8 %) positive tastv-1 anv, respectively. non-lts flocks,
these numbers 8 (20.0 %) 5 (12.5 %), respectively. maximum number of
birds positive five weeks age. also tested 130 fecal samples of
poult enteritis syndrome (pes) cases submitted minnesota veterinary
diagnostic laboratory found 19 11 positive tastv-1 anv,
respectively. rdrp gene sequences determined total 29 tastv-1 and
22 anv samples. phylogenetic analysis rdrp gene revealed 92-100 % and
88-100 % nucleotide sequence identity among tastv-1 anv sequences,
respectively. large number nucleotide amino acid substitutions were
observed lts pes flocks non-lts flocks. one pes sequences
grouped anv-like sequences detected chickens, indicating regular
screening birds continued. further, complete genome analysis 
be conducted determine whether virus novel divergent strain a
recombinant chicken turkey anv-like viruses. detection tastv-1 
anv considerable number non-lts cases emphasizes need further
studies transmission pattern pathogenesis viruses to
determine role pathogens turkeys.
