after immunization rabbits antiserum prepared purified reverse
transcriptase (revertase) avian myeloblastosis virus (amv). antiserum
demonstrated enzymeneutralizing antibody activity associated with
ummunoglobulin g fraction igm. high antigenicity amv
revertase rabbits shown. active antiserum obtained 4
immunizations rabbit approximately 20 microgram enzyme.
non-specific revertase inhibitors found normal rabbit serum, were
absent igg fraction serum. revertase activity rauscher
leukemia virus (rlv) visna virus neutralized antisera amv 
polymerase. work supported project "revertase".
