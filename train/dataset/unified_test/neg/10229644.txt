in recent studies found topical effectiveness acyclovir (acv)
formulations single-valued function c-the target site free drug
concentration. topical efficacy therapy initiated
0, 1, 2 days intracutaneous herpes simplex virus type-1 (hsv-1)
inoculation hairless mice. purpose present study examine the
hypothesis topical effectiveness cidofovir (hpmpc) would a
single valued function c would dependent upon therapy 
was initiated relative time viral infection. formulations hpmpc 
acv 95% dmso vehicle used. hairless mice intracutaneously infected
with hsv-1 used, 20 microl test formulation topically applied
twice day. protocol a, treatment continued fourth day
after virus inoculation, whereas protocol b treatment terminated on
the day virus inoculation. treatment initiated various days ranging
from day -6 day 4, lesions scored day 5. treatment acv
according protocol proved efficacious whether started early 6 days
before virus inoculation later, whereas efficacy acv annihilated if
applied following protocol b. hpmpc, hand, vivo
efficacies found strongly dependent early therapy was
initiated, significant efficacy observed even treatment was
terminated day virus inoculation. difference attributed the
virus-independent intracellular phosphorylation hpmpc slow clearance of
its metabolites cell. also noted that, similar acv, hpmpc 
the topical efficacy likely function c fixed protocol.
however, unlike acv, hpmpc efficacy single-valued function 
of c.
