japanese encephalitis (je) major public health problem south asian
countries including india. pigs serve relevant sentinel model, the
surveillance could predict potential je outbreak human population
nearby. however, existing serological detection methods like enzyme-linked immuno
sorbent assay (elisa), virus neutralization test (vnt) haemagglutination
inhibition (hi) require elaborative laboratory facilities invariably
not available field conditions. recognizing lacunae, attempts made to
develop recombinant antigen (rns1) based latex agglutination test (lat) a
rapid on-site test using covalent coupling method. four different formats were
evaluated using different coupling buffers, blocking buffers reaction
conditions. format borate buffer alkaline ph (8.5) used for
coupling antigen carboxylated beads followed blocking skimmed
milk powder found best amongst all. developed latex based test 
used screening 207 pig serum samples je revealed relative
diagnostic sensitivity specificity 80.2% 95.2%, respectively in
comparison indirect igg elisa. hence, present study demonstrated that
covalently coupled recombinant antigen based lat could used reliable
screening test surveillance je pigs field conditions.
