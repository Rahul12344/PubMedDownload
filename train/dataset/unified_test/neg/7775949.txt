the effect alpha-interferon hepatitis c genotypes examined 25
anti-hcv-positive haemophilic patients. rate multiple hcv genotypes in
patients likely mixed infections also studied. pretreatment
results showed 3/25 (12%) patients change genotypes, whereas
posttreatment rose 10/25 (40%). seven 10 (70%) patients showed a
change genotype clinical response alpha-interferon. six 25 (24%)
patients showed complete clinical response alpha-interferon, the
majority either type 2 3. study supports previous evidence 
that type 1 less likely respond alpha-interferon, that
alpha-interferon may alter concentrations various circulating
genotypes present multiply-infected patients. many difficulties in
studying hepatitis c haemophilic patients due sequence heterogeneity
within individual, study shown ideal method exists as
yet looking hcv genotypes multiply-infected individuals.
