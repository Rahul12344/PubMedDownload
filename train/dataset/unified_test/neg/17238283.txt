the addition asparagine (n)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e., glycans) to
the gp120 gp41 glycoproteins human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
envelope required correct protein folding, also may provide
protection neutralizing antibodies "glycan shield." result,
strong host-specific selection frequently associated codon positions
where nonsynonymous substitutions create disrupt potential n-linked
glycosylation sites (pngss). moreover, empirical data suggest individual
contribution pngss neutralization sensitivity infectivity hiv-1
may critically dependent presence absence pngss the
envelope sequence. evaluate glycan-glycan interactions shaped
the evolution hiv-1 envelope sequences analyzing distribution pngss 
in large-sequence alignment. using "covarion"-type phylogenetic model, we
find rates individual pngss gained lost vary
significantly time, suggesting selective advantage pngs
may depend presence absence pngss sequence.
consequently, identify specific interactions pngss alignment
using new paired-character phylogenetic model evolution, bayesian
graphical model. despite fundamental differences two methods,
several interactions jointly identified both. mapping interactions
onto structural model hiv-1 gp120 reveals negative (exclusive)
interactions occur significantly often colocalized glycans, while
positive (inclusive) interactions restricted distant glycans. our
results imply adaptive repertoire alternative configurations the
hiv-1 glycan shield limited functional interactions n-linked
glycans. represents potential vulnerability rapidly evolving hiv-1
populations may provide useful glycan-based targets neutralizing
antibodies.
