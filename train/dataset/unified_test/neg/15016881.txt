the hallmarks immune response viral infections expansion of
antigen-specific cd8(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) encounter
antigen-presenting cells lymphoid tissues subsequent
redistribution nonlymphoid tissues deal pathogen. control
mechanisms exist within ctl activation pathways prevent inappropriate ctl
responses disseminating infections broad distribution pathogen 
in host tissues. demonstrated overwhelming infection the
noncytolytic murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, clonal
exhaustion (anergy and/or deletion) ctls prevents immune-mediated pathology
but allows persistence virus. mechanism immune system
determines whether mount full response infections unknown.
here present data showing initial encounter specific ctls with
infected cells lymphoid tissues critical decision. whether the
course viral infection acute persistent life primarily depends
on degree kinetics ctl exhaustion infected lymphoid tissues.
virus-driven ctl expansion lymphoid tissues resulted migration large
quantities ctls nonlymphoid tissues, persisted stable levels.
surprisingly, although virus-specific ctls rapidly clonally exhausted in
lymphoid tissues conditions chronic infection, substantial number of
them migrated nonlymphoid tissues, retained effector phenotype
for long time. however, cells unable control infection and
progressively lost antiviral capacities (cytotoxicity cytokine
secretion) hierarchical manner eventual physical elimination.
these results illustrate differential tissue-specific regulation antiviral
t-cell responses chronic infections may help us understand the
dynamic relationship antigen t-cell populations many persistent
