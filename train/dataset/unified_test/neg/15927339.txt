epstein-barr virus (ebv) infects human target cells mainly gp350/220-cd21
and gp42-mhcii interactions; however, shown interactions
are dispensable ebv-invasion susceptible cells, suggesting other
viral proteins involved process. probable tegument
bnrf1/p140 protein involved ebv-invasion target cells, since anti-p140
antibodies inhibit ebv-infection b-lymphocytes evidence part
of protein located virus surface. sixty-six peptides, covering the
entire bnrf1/p140 sequence, synthesised tested lymphoblastoid cell
line binding assays. peptides 11465 11521 bound high affinity raji,
ramos p3hr-1 cells erythrocytes, showing cell-binding behaviour
similar ebv. two peptides induced antibodies recognising live
ebv-infected cells. interestingly, peptide-11521 (yvlqnahqiachfhsngtda) or
antibodies induced peptide inhibited ebv-binding b-lymphocytes,
suggesting p140-region could involved ebv b-lymphocyte
interaction.
