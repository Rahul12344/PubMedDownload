adenovirus vectors studied vehicles gene transfer skeletal
muscle, attractive target gene therapies inherited acquired
diseases. setting, immune responses viral proteins and/or transgene
products cause inflammation lead loss transgene expression. few
studies murine models suggested destructive cell-mediated immune
response virally encoded proteins e1-deleted adenovirus may contribute 
to elimination transgene-expressing cells. however, impact immune
responses following intramuscular administration adenovirus vectors on
transgene stability elucidated larger animal models as
nonhuman primates. demonstrate intramuscular administration of
e1-deleted adenovirus vector expressing rhesus monkey erythropoietin growth
hormone rhesus monkeys results generation th1-dependent cytotoxic
t-cell response adenovirus proteins. transgene expression dropped
significantly time still detectable animals 6 months. 
systemic levels adenovirus-specific neutralizing antibodies generated,
which blocked vector readministration. studies indicate cellular
and humoral immune response generated adenovirus proteins, context of
transgenes encoding self-proteins, hinders long-term transgene expression and
readministration first-generation vectors.
