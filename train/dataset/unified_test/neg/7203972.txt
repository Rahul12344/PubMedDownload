freeze-etching electron microscopy.

hung t, chou c, fang c, chang z.

the morphogenesis vaccinia virus studied synthesis hela
cells. freeze-etching electron microscopy demonstrated intramembrane granules
attached convex faces, granule-free area characterized eccentric location
and smooth appearance, eccentric nucleoid structure occasionally
associated membranous structure. postulated granule-free
area may precursor nucleoid envelope.
