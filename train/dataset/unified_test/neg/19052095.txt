pneumonia virus mice (pvm) strain 15 causes fatal pneumonia mice and
provides convenient model human respiratory syncytial virus pathogenesis
and immunobiology. prepared pvm mutants lacking genes nonstructural
proteins ns1 and/or ns2. vero cells, lack type interferon (ifn),
deletion proteins effect efficiency virus growth. in
ifn-competent mouse embryo fibroblasts, wild-type (wt) pvm deltans1 virus
grew efficiently strongly inhibited ifn response, whereas virus lacking
ns2 highly attenuated induced high levels ifn ifn-inducible genes.
in balb/c mice, intranasal infection wt pvm caused overt disease began 
on day 6 lethal day 9 postinoculation. comparison, deltans1 induced
transient, reduced disease, deltans2 deltans12 caused disease. thus,
ns1 ns2 virulence factors, ns2 major antagonist type 
i ifn system. pulmonary titers wt pvm deltans1 high day 3 
increased day 6; addition, expression ifn representative
proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines lymphocyte-related cytokines was
undetectable day 3 increased dramatically day 6 coincident the
onset disease. titers deltans2 deltans12 somewhat lower day
3 decreased day 6; addition, viruses induced more
circumscribed set cytokines/chemokines (ifn, interleukin-6 [il-6], cxcl10)
that detected day 3 largely subsided day 6. lung
immunohistology revealed abundant pvm-positive pneumocytes bronchial and
bronchiolar epithelial cells wt pvm- deltans1-infected mice day 6
compared pvm-positive foci deltans2 deltans12. results
indicate severe pvm disease associated high, poorly controlled virus
replication driving expression high levels pulmonary ifn broad
array cytokines/chemokines. contrast, absence ns2, an
early, transient innate response involving moderate levels ifn, il-6, and
cxcl10 restricted virus replication prevented disease.
