avian h7 influenza viruses recognized potential pandemic viruses, as
personnel often become infected poultry outbreaks. h7 infections humans
typically cause mild conjunctivitis; however, h7n9 outbreak spring 
2013 resulted severe respiratory disease. date, h7 viruses have
acquired ability sustained transmission among humans. airborne
transmission considered requirement emergence pandemic influenza,
and advanced knowledge molecular changes signature required for
transmission would allow early identification pandemic vaccine seed stocks,
screening stockpiling antiviral compounds, eradication efforts focused
on flocks harboring threatening viruses. thus, sought determine highly
pathogenic influenza h7n1 (a/h7n1) virus history human infection
could become capable airborne transmission among ferrets. show after
10 serial passages, a/h7n1 developed ability transmitted cohoused
and airborne contact ferrets. four amino acid mutations (pb2 t81i, np v284m, 
m1 r95k q211k) internal genes minimal amino acid mutation
(k/r313r) stalk region hemagglutinin protein associated with
airborne transmission. furthermore, transmission associated loss 
virulence. findings highlight importance internal genes host 
adaptation suggest natural isolates carrying mutations 
evaluated. results demonstrate highly pathogenic avian h7 virus can
become capable airborne transmission mammalian host, support
ongoing surveillance pandemic h7 vaccine development.importance: major
findings report highly pathogenic strain h7n1 avian
influenza virus adapted become capable airborne transmission in
mammals without mutations altering receptor specificity. changes receptor
specificity shown play role ability avian influenza
viruses cross species barrier, changes assumed be
essential. work reported challenges paradigm, least the
influenza viruses h7 subtype, recently become focus of
major attention, crossed humans.
