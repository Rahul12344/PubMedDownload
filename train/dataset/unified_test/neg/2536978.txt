a model secondary structure common central part (ca. 400 nucleotides) 
of 5'-untranslated regions (5'-utr) far sequenced genomes of
polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, rhinoviruses derived basis of
evolutionary thermodynamic considerations. according model, part 
of genome comprises three domains, appear involved, least in
the poliovirus genome, control viral neurovirulence vitro
translation. salient features model supported investigating 
rnas five poliovirus one coxsackievirus strains respect their
accessibility modifications dimethyl sulfate sensitivity to
single-strand- double-strand-specific nucleases. contrast previous 
suggestion, major changes conformation sabin vaccine poliovirus 
type 3 5'-utr due transition position 472 observed. biological
relevance conserved primary secondary structure elements the
