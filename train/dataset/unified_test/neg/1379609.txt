gaucher disease, lysosomal glycolipid storage disorder, results the
genetic deficiency acidic glucosidase, glucocerebrosidase (gc). the
beneficial effects allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (bmt) gaucher
disease suggest gc gene transduction transplantation autologous
hematopoietic stem cells (gene therapy) may similarly alleviate symptoms. have
constructed retroviral vector, l-gc, produced clone amphotropic
packaging cell line pa317, transduces normal human gc cdna high
efficiency. whole-marrow mononuclear cells cd34-enriched cells a
4-yr-old female type 3 gaucher disease transduced l-gc vector
and studied long-term bone marrow culture (ltbmc). prestimulation marrow
with il-3 il-6, followed co-cultivation vector-producing fibroblasts,
produced gene transfer 40-45% hematopoietic progenitor cells. the
levels gc expression progeny cells (primarily mature myelomonocytic)
produced ltbmc quantitatively analyzed northern blot, western
blot, glucocerebrosidase enzyme assay. normal levels gc rna,
immunoreactive protein, enzymatic activity detected throughout the
duration culture. studies demonstrate retroviral vectors can
efficiently transfer gc gene long-lived hematopoietic progenitor cells
from bone marrow patients gaucher disease express physiologically
relevant levels gc enzyme activity.
