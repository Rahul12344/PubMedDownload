background: efficacy highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) was
prospectively monitored hiv-1 seropositive patients analyzing hiv-1 rna
viral load.
objectives: aim study evaluate viral load course two
different groups patients (group 1: cd4>400/mm(3), group 2: cd4<200/mm(3))
during period ranging 9 25 months.
study design: hiv-1 viral load, start haart, analyzed in
117 patients previously treated two anti-transcriptase
drugs naive protease inhibitors.
results: results showed that, beginning therapy, high plasma
hiv-1 rna levels dropped undetectable values (<50 copies hiv-rna/ml) one
third patients mean period 9 months irrespective the
initial cd4 cell count, even though viral reduction least 2log(s) a
significantly shorter period time (p<0.001) observed among patients
who began retroviral therapy higher cd4 cell count.
conclusion: response haart dramatically affected initial
cd4 count. though restricted small number subjects, data support 
idea therapeutic intervention effective even advanced stage 
hiv-1 infection, patients show decreased number cd4 t-lymphocytes.
