phenothiazines identified virtual screening promising ligands for
hiv-1 tar rna a-site ribosomal rna, binding case verified
experimentally. consequently, since phenothiazines generally possess high
bioavailability low toxicity, used several nmr techniques explore the
binding characteristics acetopromazine total five different rna
constructs: four potential drug targets plus one control rna construct.
acetopromazine able bind various internal bulges terminal loops
containing purines pyrimidines, binding could detected with
double-stranded rna tetraloops. dissociation constants determined via nmr
varied 0.27 >3 mm. analysis differential saturation transfer
difference (std) nmr effects acetopromazine suggests phenothiazine
moiety closest contact binding sites tar a-site rna while
the flexible n,n-dimethylpropylamino side chain contributes less binding. nmr 
studies a-site ribosomal rna binding six commercially available
phenothiazines, establish true structure-activity
relationship, revealed distinct dependence aromatic ring side chain
substituents. substituted phenothiazines low molecular weight, not
highly charged, inherent affinity irregular tertiary rna folds,
suggesting serve novel scaffold constructing rna-binding
ligands.
