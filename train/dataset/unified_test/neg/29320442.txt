gp-1 novel glycoprotein produced streptomyces kanasenisi zx01 was
isolated soil near kanas lake significant bioactivity tobacco
mosaic virus. however, extremely low fermentation production largely hindered
further research market applications glycoprotein gp-1. study,
response surface methodology used optimize fermentation conditions a
shake flask higher glycoprotein gp-1 production. optimized
fermentation conditions inoculum volume 6%, initial ph 6.5, and
rotating speed 150 rpm, glycoprotein gp-1 production could reach 0.9253 mg/l, 
which increased 52.14% compared original conditions. addition,
scale-up fermentation conducted 5-l bioreactor preliminarily explore 
the feasibility mass production glycoprotein gp-1 large fermentor,
obtaining gp-1 production 2.54 mg/l conditions, 2.75 
times higher production obtained shake flask 0.9253 mg/l. this
work helpful improve gp-1 production large scale lay the
foundations developing novel agent plant virus.
