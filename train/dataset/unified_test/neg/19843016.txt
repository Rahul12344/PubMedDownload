purpose: aetiology apparently vasoocclusive phenomena human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-related retinopathy well understood. several 
hypotheses, including infectious damage retinal vasculature altered
retinal haemodynamics, postulated. direct measurement oxygen tension
in retina possible vivo indirect methods employed.
the objective study investigate retinal vascular response to
100% oxygen breathing patients hiv.
methods: twelve patients infected hiv 12 healthy individuals, matched
for age, sex smoking habits, studied open study using the
blue-field entoptic technique measurement retinal white blood cell
(wbc) flux. reactivity retinal blood flow 100% o(2) breathing 15
min measured expressed percentage change baseline.
results: wbc velocity oxygen inhalation decreased baseline 9.0 ±
5.8% hiv-infected patients 18.6 ± 5.4% healthy participants (p <
0.04 groups, anova). decrease wbc velocity paralleled a
decrease wbc density. decrease tended pronounced healthy
participants (13.6 ± 7.9%) hiv-infected patients (8.0 ± 10.8%), the
difference statistically significant (p = 0.1 groups, anova). wbc
flux decrease 16.2 ± 11.4% hiv-infected patients 29.5 ± 9.5% the
control group significant groups (p = 0.007 groups,
anova).
conclusion: results indicate reduced reactivity wbc flux systemic
hyperoxia patients hiv. whether abnormal retinal haemodynamics in
hiv-infected persons contributes pathogenesis hiv-related microvascular
diseases consequence structural changes associated the
disease unknown.
