reconsidering early steps protein secretion.

hall mn, schwartz m.

we reviewed unique mutation affecting hydrophilic segment the
lambda-receptor signal sequence. considering implications mutation,
we proposed model depicting early steps protein secretion. salient,
novel features model follows. 1) model explicitly states 
the lamb protein must initiate export process synthesized. commitment
to synthesis occur subsequent interaction hydrophilic segment
of signal sequence membrane export site, initial interaction
between nascent secreted protein membrane. implicit concept
is obligatory co-translational secretion lambda receptor. 2) suggest the
existence "stop translation" sequence. role sequence halt 
translation order allow sufficient time hydrophilic portion 
signal sequence initiate export interacting membrane receptor. 3) we
suggest least part "stop translation" sequence located
down-stream signal sequence, residue 15 mature lamb
protein. 4) speculate, albeit absence direct evidence, 
the hydrophobic portion signal sequence may also part "stop
translation" sequence.
