several new direct-acting antiviral (daa) drugs developed are
already approved treatment chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. 
hcv variants presenting drug-resistant phenotypes observed vitro and
during clinical trials. aim study characterize amino acid
changes positions previously associated resistance ns3 protease in
untreated brazilian patients infected hcv genotypes 1a 1b. plasma
samples 171 untreated brazilian patients infected hcv obtained
from department gastroenterology clinics hospital (hcfmusp) são
paulo, brazil. nested pcr sanger sequencing used obtain genetic
information ns3 protein. bioinformatics used confirm subtype
information analyze frequencies resistance mutations. results the
genotype analysis using non-ns3 targeted methods variance those
obtained ns3 protease phylogenetic analyses. found 7.4% of
patients infected hcv genotype 1a showed resistance-associated mutations
v36l, t54s, q80k, r155k, 5.1% patients infected hcv genotype 1b
had resistance-associated mutations v36l, q41r, t54s, d168s. notably,
codons positions 80 155 differed samples brazilian patient
used study global isolates. present study demonstrates that
genotyping methods targeting ns3 protein showed difference results 
compared mainstream methodologies (inno-lipa polymerase sequencing). the
resistance mutations present untreated patients infected hcv codon
composition bias geographical location warrant closer examination.
