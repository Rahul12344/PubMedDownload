rhesus monkeys completely protected rabies single dose of
experimental, highly concentrated, rabies virus vaccine prepared virus
propagated cultures human diploid cells administered several hours
after infection street rabies virus. protection seemed related 
high antigenicity vaccine ability induce interferon in
vaccinated animals. partial protection afforded one three
inoculations less concentrated vaccines prepared cultures of
human diploid cells primary hamster kidney cells capable 
inducing interferon. level virus-neutralizing antibody induced by
vaccination could correlated final outcome disease. the
simultaneous inoculation vaccine interferon inducers (polyribocytidylic
acid homopolymer pair newcastle disease virus) improve results
obtained vaccine along, fact indicates factors than
interferon antibody may play important role treatment rabies
after exposure.
