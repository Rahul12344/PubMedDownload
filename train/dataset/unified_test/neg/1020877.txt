venezuelan encephalitis virus constant menace man animals,
particularly horses. two yet unreported strains isolated french
guyana: ca 410d (tonate) ca ar 508 (cabassou). neurovirulent 
after peripheral inoculation adult mice guinea pigs. cabassou not
pathogenic adult mice intracerebral inoculation. third strain, ca ar 
19007, antigenically identical complement-fixation cabassou, but
appears cross react strains, tonate, injected
intra-peritoneally sub-cutaneously, protects adult mice intra-cerebral
or intra-peritoneal challenge everglades virus. ca ar 19007 isolate
causes total protection everglades virus injected intra-peritoneally, 
but partial protection sub-cutaneous route. cabassou, other
hand, injected intra-peritoneally protect intra-cerebral
challenge everglades. tonate ca ar 19007 thus appear naturally
occurring attenuated variants venezuelan encephalitis virus complex, which
can protect mice intra-cerebral infection neurovirulent strains.
