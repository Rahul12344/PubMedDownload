bace, beta-secretase, attractive target treatment alzheimer's 
disease involvement generation amyloid beta peptides.
bace type transmembrane aspartyl protease composed pre-, pro-,
catalytic, transmembrane cytoplasmic domains. present study, the
coding sequence truncated transmembrane domain the
resulting construct extended c-terminal addition (his)(6) and
expressed several mammalian host cells. enzyme expressed cho cells 
the best crystallographic behavior purified large quantities a
three step procedure. purified bace comprised two forms, namely the
full length probace construct beginning thr(1), derivative missing the
first 24 amino acids beginning e(25). bace precursors co-crystallized 
in presence inhibitors yielding structures 3.2 resolution. hiv-1
protease treatment mixture resulted complete cleavage the
f(39)-v(40) bond, leaving v(40)em...es(432) (his)(6) derivative was
purified yielding enzyme active untreated bace but
co-crystallized inhibitors producing well shaped, bipyramidal co-crystals
diffracting 2.6 resolution.
