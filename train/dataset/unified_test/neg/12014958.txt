zanamivir oseltamivir, specific inhibitors influenza virus neuraminidase, 
have significantly different characteristics resistance studies. cases
resistance known arise mutations either hemagglutinin or
neuraminidase surface proteins. new inhibitor development biocryst
pharmaceuticals, bcx-1812, guanidino group, zanamivir, a
bulky hydrophobic group, oseltamivir. using influenza
a/nws/tern/australia/g70c/75 (h1n9), neuraminidase variants e119g r292k 
previously selected different inhibitors. sensitivity these
variants bcx-1812 measured found cases be
intermediate zanamivir oseltamivir. addition, x-ray
crystal structures complexes bcx-1812 wild type two
mutant neuraminidases determined. ligand bound identical manner
in structure, rearrangement side chain e276 its
ligand-free position. structural explanation mechanism resistance 
bcx-1812, relative zanamivir oseltamivir particular, provided.
