the dna tumor virus simian virus 40 (sv40) model system studying
eukaryotic replication. sv40 large tumor antigen (ltag) initiator/helicase
that essential genome replication. ltag recognizes assembles the
viral replication origin. determined structure two multidomain ltag
subunits bound origin dna. structure reveals origin binding
domains (obds) zn aaa+ domains involved origin recognition and
assembly. notably, obds recognize origin unexpected manner. the
histidine residues aaa+ domains insert narrow minor groove region
with enhanced negative electrostatic potential. computational analysis indicates 
that region intrinsically narrow, demonstrating role dna shape
readout origin recognition. results provide important insights the
assembly ltag initiator/helicase replication origin suggest
that histidine contacts minor groove serve mechanism dna shape
readout.
