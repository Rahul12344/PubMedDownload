various factors influencing detection human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) in
infected cells dna-dna hybridization investigated. employing the
hind iii fragment hcmv ad169 labelled 32p, found detection
sensitivity highly influenced method employed extraction dna
from infected cells. excision hind iii fragment vector by
restriction endonuclease digestion prior 32p-labelling improved the
detection capability probe. similarly, cytomegalovirus (cmv) dna detection
employing biotin-labelled probes streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase the
hybridot assay also highly dependent method dna extraction prior to
hybridization. finally, describe situ assay employing biotin-labelled 
probe fluorescein-conjugated avidin detect cmv dna cultured cells.
