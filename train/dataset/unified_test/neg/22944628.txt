equine herpesvirus-1 (ehv-1) continues cause sporadic epidemic
abortions despite extensive vaccination. lack progress development of
protective vaccines may hindered lack equine abortion models that
employ contemporary ehv-1 strains. objective experiments to
compare contemporary ehv-1 strain previously described challenge strain,
and quantify ehv-1 loads various maternal fetal tissues. infection
experiments performed two groups 7 pregnant pony mares 270-290 days
of gestation contemporary ehv-1 strain (university findlay 2003 isolate
- oh03) ehv-1 strain isolated 30 years ago, previously described
in abortion models (ab4). mares groups exhibited nasal viral shedding
and viremia. infection oh03 resulted 1/7 abortion infection ab4 
resulted 5/7 abortions. oh03 challenge, placentas foals delivered at
term showed little detectable virus, aborted fetus expressed high
levels virus infection spleen liver, lower levels lung and
thymus, lowest levels chorioallantois. ab4 challenge, high viral
loads detected fetal placental tissues abortions. two
normal deliveries, chorioallantois contained virus levels comparable the
chorioallantois aborted foals foals shed ehv-1 starting day 4 of
life, clinically healthy. results demonstrate continued
importance strain selection abortion models, study first
report viral load quantification using contemporary methods. extremely high
ehv-1 loads decidua abortions illustrate infection risk posed to
other horses.
