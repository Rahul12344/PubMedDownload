we examined five children underwent allogeneic peripheral stem cell
transplantation (psct) using positively selected cd34+ cells three two
loci-mismatched donors. cd34+ cells mobilized peripheral blood were
separated immunomagnetic beads. cd34+ cells 2.2-6.2 x 10(6)/kg were
transplanted three patients refractory leukemia, patient with
relapsed medulloblastoma patient fanconi's anemia following a
conditioning regimen included irradiation, alkylating agents and
antithymocyte globulin treatment. number infused cd3+ cells included in
grafts 2.3-22.7 x 10(4)/kg. four patients achieved engraftment and
hematopoietic reconstitution (> 5 x 10(8)/l neutrophils day 10 11).
graft rejection observed patient fanconi's anemia, rapid
engraftment obtained second psct. although prophylactic agents other
than atg (included conditioning regimen) used, greater grade i
acute gvhd observed, limited chronic gvhd observed two
patients. two patients leukemia relapsed days 103 210,
respectively, patient medulloblastoma died disease day 159.
the patient fanconi's anemia died fungal infection. cmv hhv-6
diseases developed four two patients, respectively. thus, although sct
using positively selected peripheral cd34+ cells may alternative approach
for overcoming graft rejection gvhd hla- mismatched donors, persistent
immune deficiency attributing extremely low numbers cells grafts can
potentially lead reactivation herpes viruses.
