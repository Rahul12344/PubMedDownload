setting: although incidence tuberculosis decreasing many
years, recently risen.
objectives: investigate changes pattern distribution of
intestinal tuberculosis alert surgeons importance maintaining 
high index suspicion disease entity.
design: retrospective analysis 134 patients intestinal tuberculosis
discharged veterans general hospital taipei 1965 1995. all
records, bacteriological examinations pathological specimens reviewed
and extracted onto standard questionnaire.
results: decline case numbers intestinal tuberculosis noted after
1975. however, seems slight rise case numbers since 1990. the
average age patients 1990 (64.8 years) higher before
1990 (44.4 years). none patients clinical signs human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. patients (81.3%, 109/134) not
received definite diagnosis surgery. active pulmonary tuberculosis was
found 37 patients (29.1%).
conclusion: possible reasons rise cases intestinal tuberculosis
in patients may linked increased life expectancy, reappearance
of formerly 'silent' tuberculosis cases, relapse patients having
received incomplete antituberculosis chemotherapy. insidious non-specific
clinical presentation makes diagnosis intestinal tuberculosis difficult.
an increased index suspicion greater familiarity disease may
shorten time diagnosis may also prevent unnecessary operations.
