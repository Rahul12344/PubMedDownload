acute exposure cocaine transiently induces several fos family transcription
factors nucleus accumbens, region brain important for
addiction. contrast, chronic exposure cocaine induce these
proteins, instead causes persistent expression highly stable isoforms 
of deltafosb. deltafosb also induced nucleus accumbens repeated
exposure drugs abuse, including amphetamine, morphine, nicotine and
phencyclidine. sustained accumulation deltafosb nucleus accumbens
indicates transcription factor may mediate persistent
neural behavioural plasticity accompanies chronic drug exposure. using
transgenic mice deltafosb induced adults subset of
nucleus accumbens neurons cocaine induces protein, show that
deltafosb expression increases responsiveness animal rewarding
and locomotor-activating effects cocaine. effects deltafosb appear to
be mediated partly induction ampa
(alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole) glutamate receptor subunit glur2 
the nucleus accumbens. results support model deltafosb, by
altering gene expression, enhances sensitivity cocaine may thereby
contribute cocaine addiction.
