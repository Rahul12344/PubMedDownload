to develop allele independent ribozyme treatment autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa (adrp) associated mutations rhodopsin (rho)
gene, ribozyme targeting dog, mouse, human rat rhodopsin (rho) mrna was
designed tested vitro. activity ribozyme tested tissue
culture co-transfection hek 293 cells plasmids expressing opsin mrna
and ribozyme, followed quantitative rt-pcr evaluate level rho mrna. 
for experiments vivo, rz525 driven mouse opsin proximal promoter was
inserted plasmids aav 2 terminal repeats (tr) packaged aav
serotype 5 capsids. aav-rz525 injected subretinally right eyes of
p23h rat pups. left eyes injected virus expressing gfp the
identical promoter. animals analyzed 4, 8 12 weeks post-injection 
full field scotopic electroretinography (erg). 12 weeks, animals were
sacrificed retinas dissected, fixed sectioned. rz525 high
catalytic activity vitro led 50% reduction rho mrna cells.
aav-rz525 injection p23h transgenic rats led significant preservation
(about 50%) scotopic erg a- b-wave amplitudes. histological analysis
showed increased number onl nuclei central superior retina of
treated eyes relative control eyes. rt-pcr analysis revealed 46% reduction 
transgenic (mouse) rho mrna right eyes relative left eyes change 
rat rho mrna. aav5 delivery rz525 resulted partial rescue light
response structural preservation photoreceptors transgenic rats. this
ribozyme may useful component rna replacement gene therapy adrp.
