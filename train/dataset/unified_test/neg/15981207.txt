effective eradication human papillomavirus (hpv)-positive tumors may require
cd8+ cd4+ t-cell-mediated immune responses. ectopic expression mhc class
ii surface molecules described context cervical cancer, but
coexpression components mhc class ii antigen presentation
pathway addressed. evaluated mhc class ii antigen
presentation pathway malignant squamous epithelium hpv+ cervical cancer
lesions situ costaining hla-dr clip dma/dmb. cervical cancer cells 
exhibit 3 mhc class ii phenotypes: (i) dr+/clip+ dm+; (ii) dr+/clip- dm-;
and (iii) dr-/clip+ dm+. identical profile identified hpv+
me180 cells, serve target hla-dr4-restricted hpv68,
e7-specific cd4+ cells. ifn-gamma pretreatment me180 cells, associated 
differential trafficking mhc class ii molecules, necessary effective
t-cell recognition. although proinflammatory cytokines may facilitate mhc class
ii-restricted antigen recognition tumor cells, different phenotypes mhc
class ii antigen presentation pathway may associated evasion from
cd4+-mediated cellular immune responses.
