background: assays screen confirm presence antibody for
human t-lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i) currently performed serum 
plasma. developed evaluated new counting immunoassay (cia) the
detection htlv-i antibody whole blood, using recombinant synthetic
peptide antigens.
methods: assessed cia detection htlv-i antibody whole blood 
plasma. cia immunity-measuring method combines latex agglutination
with particle-counting technology. numbers agglutinated latex particles,
single latex particles, blood cells sample measured based on
differences particle size latex particles blood cells.
results: cia elisa methods agreement 24 plasma samples
tested, including 6 patients htlv-i-associated diseases, 6 htlv-i
carriers, 12 htlv-i antibody-negative individuals. concordance between
the elisa (plasma) cia (whole blood) samples 24 patients was
100%. concordance particle agglutination method (plasma) the
cia (plasma whole blood) 1065 patients 99.5%. concordance 
results obtained 1065 pairs plasma whole blood samples cia
method 100%. htlv-i antibody whole blood stable 3 days blood
collection. cia method, results available within 15 min.
conclusions: cia method used screening htlv-i. use whole
blood rather serum plasma reduces sample volume number blood
collections required, well assay time.
