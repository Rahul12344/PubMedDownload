background aims: creb (camp response element binding protein) transcription
factors key regulators homeostatic functions liver, cre binding
is increased hepatic inflammation. chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection, mutations deletions pre-s region frequently observed.
these mutations affect pre-s2/s promoter controlling hbv envelope protein
expression (hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag)) associated with
worsened clinical outcome. aimed test creb activation impacts hbsag
expression.
methods: effect creb inducer protein kinase (pka) tested by
coexpression hbv wild-type vector vitro. luciferase reporter gene
constructs cloned identify novel regulatory regions hbv pre-s2/s 
promoter. electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) gelshift supershift
experiments conducted confirm dna transcription factor binding.
results: coexpression hbv pka resulted hbv-s mrna induction and
enhanced small envelope protein expression. identified creb binding motif in
the transcribed part pre-s2 region, contributing basal promoter
activity via binding activating transcription factor 2 (atf2). second creb
motif closely linked s-atg showed similar binding pattern involving atf2
and creb1, without appearing essential basal promoter activity. moreover, a
sequence pre-s2 region responsible transcriptional
induction via creb activators pka forskolin. emsa experiments
indicate creb1 atf4 involved complex formation conferring pka
dependent promoter activation.
conclusions: data suggest novel mechanism hbv may utilise creb/pka
signal transduction pathways hepatocytes enhance hbsag expression
during homeostasis hepatic inflammation.
