hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection main cause chronic liver disease
after renal transplantation, represents risk factor graft loss and
patient death. hepatitis c (+) kidney transplant candidates remain the
waiting list show greater risk mortality transplanted, 
risk escalates time. aim study examine impact of
hcv infection patient allograft survival transplant population.
among 90 renal transplant patients transplanted 1991 2002 were
retrospectively analyzed, 45 hcv-positive 45 hcv-negative serology.
all positive patients shown positive hcv antibody and/or positive hcv rna.
the mean ages patients 36.2 +/- 9 years among hcv (+) 38 +/- 
10 years among hcv (-) patients (p = .31). eighteen hcv (+) patients 14
hcv (-) patients received grafts deceased donors. the
immunosuppressive protocols similar groups. number acute
rejection episodes 13 (30%) hcv (+) 6 (13%) hcv (-) group (p =
.006). diabetes mellitus developed 10 (23%) hcv (+) 7 (16%) hcv (-)
patients (p = .04). cytomegalovirus disease occurred 5 (16%) hcv (+) 2
(6%) hcv (-) patients (p = .32). mean serum creatinine 1.85 +/- 1.1 mg/dl
in hcv (+) 1.8 +/- 1 mg/dl hcv (-) group (p = .82). mean graft
survivals 97.1 +/- 52 months hcv (+) 81.1 +/- 37 months the
hcv (-) group (p = .04). seven hcv (+) patients (16%) three hcv (-) patients 
(6%) lost grafts (p = .04). advanced cirrhosis developed three hcv (+)
patients (6%). one patient died hcv (+) group. patient survivals 98% 
in hcv (+) 100% hcv (-) cohorts. study, rate graft 
loss higher hcv (+) patients, whereas patient survival similar.
