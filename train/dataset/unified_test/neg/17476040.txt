medications, specifically protease inhibitor therapy, patients hiv been
further noted premature coronary artery disease, hypercoagulability,
hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, fat redistribution syndrome increased
tendency myocardial infarction. article, report one patient with
hiv disease protease inhibitor therapy presented non-q-wave
