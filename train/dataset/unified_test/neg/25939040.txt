inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), crohn's disease ulcerative colitis, are
poorly understood disorders affecting intestinal tract. current model for
disease suggests genetically susceptible patients develop intolerance gut
microflora, chronic inflammation develops result environmental
insults. although interest mainly focused studying genetic variants and
gut bacterial flora, little known potential viral infection to
contribute disease. accordingly, conducted metagenomic analysis to
document baseline virome colonic biopsy samples patients ibd 
order assess contribution viral infection ibd. libraries were
generated colon rna create approximately 2 gb sequence data per library. 
using bioinformatic pipeline designed detect viral sequences, 1000
viral reads derived directly tissue without coculture isolation 
procedure. herein, describe complexity abundance viruses,
bacteria/bacteriophage, human endogenous retroviral sequences 10
patients ibd 5 healthy subjects undergoing surveillance colonoscopy.
differences gut microflora abundance mammalian viruses human
endogenous retroviruses readily detected metagenomic analyses.
specifically, patients herpesviridae sequences colon demonstrated
increased expression human endogenous viral sequences differences the
diversity microbiome. study provides promising metagenomic
approach describe colonic microbiome used better understand
virus-host phage-bacteria interactions ibd.
