complex web ecological interactions spun diverse assortment of
participants (pro- eukaryotes viruses). aquatic microbial
communities, numerically abundant actors, viruses, remain most
elusive, especially freshwaters identities ecology remain
unknown. here, using ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing pelagic freshwater
habitats, recovered complete genomes > 2000 phages, including small
"miniphages" large "megaphages" infecting iconic freshwater prokaryotic
lineages. instance, abundant freshwater actinobacteria support infection a

phage genomes revealed evanescence primary dynamic upper water layers, 
where displayed short-lived existences. contrast, persistence was

recovered repeatedly. phage host abundances corresponded closely, with
distinct populations displaying preferential distributions different seasons
and depths, closely mimicking overall stratification mixis.
