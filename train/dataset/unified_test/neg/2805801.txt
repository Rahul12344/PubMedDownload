most abelson murine leukemia virus (a-mulv)-transformed cell lines derived from
scid (severe combined immune deficient) mice actively rearrange endogenous 
immunoglobulin (ig) heavy (h), light (l) chain variable region genes.
such cell lines express germline vh segments rna transcripts are
characteristically produced early precursor (pre)-b lymphocytes, not
express high levels transcripts germline kappa (k) constant region (c
kappa) locus. however, derived scid a-mulv transformants express
germline c kappa transcripts attempt kappa gene assembly. one case kappa
gene expression rearrangement occurred absence mu h chain
expression, another induced efficiently introduction a
mu-expression vector. although vast majority scid h l chain coding
sequence joins grossly aberrant, scid a-mulv transformants form normal
coding joints low frequency. contrast, cells form generally
normal signal sequence joins approximately normal efficiency. thus, these
findings mechanistically distinguish coding signal join formation. subcloning
analyses suggest scid a-mulv transformants attempt chromosomal
coding sequence joining may relative survival advantage, therefore
that events may often result unrepaired chromosomal breakage cell
death.
