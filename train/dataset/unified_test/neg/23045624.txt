background: cytomegalovirus (cmv) associated ischemic heart disease (ihd)
among organ transplant recipients. relationship levels of
antibody cmv ihd immunocompetent individuals uncertain.
methods: measured baseline cmv immunoglobulin g (igg) levels 12,574
participants without ihd population-based epic-norfolk cohort, aged
40-70 years old recruitment 1993-1997. underlying causes death or
hospitalization 31 march 2008 abstracted death certificates a
database hospital admissions, respectively.
results: participants, 58% seropositive cmv. mean
follow-up 12 years (standard deviation, 2.2 years), 1356 first-time ihd events
occurred. adjustment classic ihd risk factors, belonging highest
antibody group associated increased risk incident ihd, compared
with seronegativity (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.42).
after additional adjustment measures social class, inflammation, and
possible confounders, association unchanged (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95%
confidence interval, 1.04-11.41).
conclusions: first population study show cmv igg antibody
levels related incident ihd compared seronegativity. studies
correlating cmv antibody levels direct measurements active infection will
be necessary.
