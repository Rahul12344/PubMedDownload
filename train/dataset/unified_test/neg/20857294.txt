t cells detect infected transformed cells via antigen presentation major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules cell surface. cell
stimulation, mhc molecules present fragments proteins expressed
or taken cell. fragments generated distinct proteolytic
mechanisms presentation mhc class molecules cytotoxic cd8(+) on
mhc class ii molecules helper cd4(+) cells. proteasomes primarily
involved mhc class ligand lysosomes, mhc class ii ligand generation. 
autophagy delivers cytoplasmic material lysosomes and, therefore, contributes 
to cytoplasmic antigen presentation mhc class ii molecules. addition, it
has recently realized process also supports extracellular antigen 
processing mhc class ii presentation cross-presentation mhc class i
molecules. although exact mechanisms regulation antigen
processing pathways autophagy still unknown, recent studies, summarized in
this review, suggest contribute immune responses infections 
and maintain tolerance. moreover, targeted viruses immune
escape could maybe harnessed immunotherapy.
