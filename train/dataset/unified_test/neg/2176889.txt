poisons caused strong protein association distinct subsets simian virus
40 (sv40) dna replication intermediates. basis known specificity
and mechanisms action drugs, proteins involved assumed 
the respective topoisomerases. camptothecin, topoisomerase poison, caused
strong protein association form ii (relaxed circular) form iii (linear) 
viral genomes replication intermediates broken dna replication forks
but form (superhelical) viral dna normal late replication
intermediates present. contrast, type ii topoisomerase poisons
caused completely replicated forms late viral replication forms tightly
bound protein--some greater extent others. different type ii
topoisomerase inhibitors caused distinctive patterns protein association

type ii topoisomerase poisons caused small amount form (superhelical) sv40
dna protein-associated vivo. protein complex form viral dna
was entirely drug-dependent strong, apparently noncovalent. protein
associated form dna may represent drug-stabilized "topological complex" 
between type ii topoisomerase sv40 dna.
