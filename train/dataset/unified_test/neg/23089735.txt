cystinosis autosomal recessive metabolic disease belongs family
of lysosomal storage disorders (lsds). defective gene ctns encoding the
lysosomal cystine transporter, cystinosin. cystine accumulates tissues and
leads organ damage including end-stage renal disease. using ctns(-/-)
murine model cystinosis, tested use hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (hspc) genetically modified express functional ctns
transgene using self-inactivating-lentiviral vector (sin-lv). showed that
transduced cells capable decreasing cystine content tissues and
improved kidney function. transduced hspc retained differentiative
capabilities, populating tissue compartments examined allowing long-term 
expression transgene. direct correlation levels lentiviral 
dna present peripheral blood levels present tissues were
demonstrated, could useful follow future patients. using new model 
of cystinosis, dsred ctns(-/-) mice, lv driving expression the
fusion protein cystinosin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp), showed
that cystinosin transferred ctns-expressing cells ctns-deficient
adjacent cells vitro vivo. transfer led cystine decreases in
ctns-deficient cells vitro. data suggest mechanism of
cross-correction possible cystinosis.
