the emergence escape-mutants influenza hemagglutinin (ha) following
vaccination compels yearly re-formulation flu vaccines. since binding 
sialic acid receptor remains cases essential infection, small-molecule
inhibitors ha binding sialic acid could interesting therapeutic
complements alternatives immuno-prophylaxis control flu
epidemics. work, made use nmr spectroscopy study interaction
between derivative sialic acid (the neu5ac-α-(2,6)-gal-β-(1-4)-glcnac
trisaccharide) (h1 h5) human avian strains influenza
virus, directly expressed surface stable transfected 293 human cells.
the shown retain native trimeric conformation binding
properties. exploiting magnetization transfer proteins the
ligand, obtained evidence binding event mapped (non-identical) 
sugar epitopes recognized two ha species. rapid reliable method
for screening sialic acid-related ha ligands developed could yield useful
information efficient drug design.
