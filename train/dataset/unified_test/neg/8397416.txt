the relation age infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) the
development carrier state examined using data number of
published unpublished surveys. remarkably consistent relation found.
infants infected perinatally (within first 6 months life) found to
have high probability becoming carriers (0.885; 95% c.l. 0.84-0.93). over
the infant early childhood age classes found sharp decrease
in proportion infections lead carrier state. adulthood
(over 15 years) probability developing carrier status found 
about 0.1. model fitted data using maximum likelihood, which
provides good empirical description observed data used to
predict expected probability developing carrier state given age at
infection. postulated that, result rapid decline the
probability becoming carrier early childhood, mass childhood
immunization campaign, tend postpone average age infection
in unvaccinated community, disproportionately large impact the
rate generation new carriers.
