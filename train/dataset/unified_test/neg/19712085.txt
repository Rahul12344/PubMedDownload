differentiation recurrent hepatitis c virus (hcv) disease acute cellular 
rejection (acr) following liver transplantation difficult. previously, 
have found mxa protein, specific sensitive marker type 1
interferon production, strongly expressed chronic hcv disease. here, we
investigate mxa expression marker recurrent hcv disease livers of
14 adult hcv patients underwent liver transplantation. serial liver biopsies 
available 12 patients stained mxa protein scored using 
a semi-quantitative approach. hepatocellular mxa protein levels were
significantly up-regulated (p = 0.025) recurrent hcv disease comparison 
acr. biopsies showed histological changes consistent recurrent hcv
disease, strong hepatocellular mxa staining present 14/18 (78%). the
liver biopsies histological evidence acr, strong mxa hepatocellular
staining present three 10 (30%). thus, assessment of
hepatocellular mxa protein expression contribute differential
diagnosis acr recurrent hcv disease following liver transplantation. in
conclusion, analysis intrahepatic mxa levels potential reduce the
inappropriate use high-dose pulsing steroids post-operatively.
