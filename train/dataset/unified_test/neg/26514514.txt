background: aims study evaluate diagnostic prognostic
roles serum osteopontin (opn) single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in
the opn promoter patients hepatitis b-related hepatocellular carcinoma
(hcc).
materials methods: four groups studied, included 157 patients with
hcc, 73 liver cirrhosis (lc) 97 chronic hepatitis (ch), along 
80 healthy subjects. serum opn alpha-fetoprotein (afp) levels measured. 
the snps -66 t/g, -156 g/Î´g -433 c/t within opn promoter determined 
by direct sequencing.
results: serum opn levels significantly higher patients hcc 
the groups. area receiver operating characteristics curves in
distinguishing hcc chronic liver disease (cld; ch lc) 0.782 (95%
ci; 0.729-0.834) opn 0.888 (95% ci; 0.850-0.927) afp. using the
optimal cut-off value (70 ng/ml), opn sensitivity specificity 72% 
71%, respectively. serum opn superior afp detecting early-stage hcc
(68% vs. 46%). combination markers yielded improved sensitivity 
detecting early hcc 82%. high opn level significantly correlated with
advanced bclc stage independent prognostic factor hcc. snps
-156 -443 associated susceptibility hcc, related to
overall survival.
conclusions: serum opn useful diagnostic prognostic marker hcc. 
combined use serum opn afp improved diagnosis early hcc. genetic
variation opn promoter associated risk, prognosis 
of hcc.
