european brown hare syndrome (ebhs) characterised high mortality of
european brown hares (lepus europaeus) mountain hares (lepus timidus).
european brown hare syndrome virus (ebhsv) closely related rabbit
haemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) comprise genus lagovirus, family
caliciviridae. contrast rhdv, well studied, 30
complete genome sequences available, complete genome sequence available 
for ebhsv obtained strain isolated 1989 france. ebhs was
originally diagnosed sweden 1980. here, report complete coding
sequences two ebhsv strains isolated european brown hares died 
liver lesions characteristic ebhs sweden 1982. sequences represent
the oldest complete coding sequences ebhsv isolated original area 
virus diagnosis. genomic organisation similar published
french sequence. comparison sequence revealed several nucleotide
substitutions, corresponding 6 % divergence. amino acid level, the
swedish strains 2 % different french strain. amino acid
substitutions located within major capsid protein vp60, when
considering amino acid sequence length protein, vp10 protein
with highest percentage amino acid differences. result was
obtained swedish strains compared. evolutionary pattern not
been described previously members genus lagovirus.
