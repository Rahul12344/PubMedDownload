hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) sixth prevalent cancer third
most frequent cause cancer-related death developing countries, especially
in east asia south africa, identification new biomarkers early
diagnosis prognosis needed. delta-like 1 homologue (drosophila) (dlk1) 
expressed malignancies promotes cancer cell stemness tumourigenicity, 
which makes molecule potential target therapies directed against
cancer stem/progenitor cells. here, aimed assess predictive value of
dlk1 diagnostic prognostic biomarker hcc. purpose, serum
dlk1 levels detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in
serum specimens 397 hcc patients, 114 healthy individuals, 43 patients 
chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection 24 cirrhotic liver patients with
hbv infection, correlation dlk1 levels clinical features 
evaluated. data showed serum dlk1 level significantly higher 
hcc patients healthy individuals patients chronic hbv infection
(hbv carriers) (p < 0.05). moreover, serum dlk1 levels positively
correlated tumour size α-fetoprotein (afp) levels, gender, 
age, histological grade, hbv infection, intrahepatic metastasis cirrhosis in
hcc patients. kaplan-meier analysis indicated higher dlk1 levels were
associated shorter survival hcc patients. results suggest 
serum levels dlk1 may serve prognostic biomarker hcc patients.
