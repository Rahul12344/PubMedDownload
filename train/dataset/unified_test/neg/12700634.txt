tissue homeostasis requires balancing cell proliferation programmed cell
death. igf1 significantly suppressed etoposide-induced apoptosis, measured by
caspase 3 activation quantitation cellular subg(1) dna content, rat
parotid salivary acinar cells (c5). transduction c5 cells adenovirus
expressing constitutively activated mutant akt-suppressed etoposide-induced 
apoptosis, whereas kinase-inactive mutant akt suppressed protective
effect igf1. igf1 also suppressed apoptosis induced taxol brefeldin a. 
egf unable suppress apoptosis induced etoposide, able to
synergize igf1 suppress caspase 3 activation dna cleavage
after etoposide treatment. catalytic activity akt significantly higher
following stimulation growth factors compared stimulation igf1 
or egf alone. results suggest threshold activated akt required
for suppression apoptosis cooperative action growth factors in
regulating salivary gland homeostasis.
