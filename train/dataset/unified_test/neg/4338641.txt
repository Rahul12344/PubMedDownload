genetic analysis simian virus 40. 3. characterization a
temperature-sensitive mutant blocked early stage productive infection in
monkey cells.

robb ja, martin rg.

a temperature-sensitive mutant simian virus 40 (sv40), ts(*)101, been
characterized productive infection monkey kidney cells. mutant
virion adsorb penetrate cell normally restrictive
temperature, cannot induce synthesis cellular deoxyribonucleic acid
(dna) initiate synthesis sv40-specific tumor, virion, u antigens or
viral dna. first-cycle infection purified ts(*)101 dna normal the
restrictive temperature, resulting progeny virions still
temperature-sensitive. mutant neither complements inhibits other
temperature-sensitive sv40 mutants wild-type virions. affected protein 
the ts(*)101 mutant may regulatory structural protein, possibly core
protein, interacting viral dna.
