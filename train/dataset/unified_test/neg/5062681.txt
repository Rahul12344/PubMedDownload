intracellular forms adenovirus deoxyribonucleic acid. i. evidence a
deoxyribonucleic acid-protein complex baby hamster kidney cells infected 
adenovirus type 12.

the total intracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) baby hamster kidney
cells abortively infected (3)h-adenovirus type 12 analyzed in
dye-buoyant density gradients. 10 20% cell-associated
radioactivity derived viral dna bands density position 0.043
to 0.085 g/cm(3) higher viral dna extracted purified virions.
the dna high-density region (hp-fraction) almost completely absent when
dna, ribonucleic acid (rna) protein synthesis chemically inhibited in
separate experiments. hp-fraction found virus adsorb
to enter cell. dna hp-fraction appears early 2 hr 
inoculation. 2 hr infection, hp-fraction present the
nucleus cytoplasm. dna hybridizes exclusively viral dna and
sediments approximately rate neutral alkaline sucrose
density gradients. electron microscopy revealed circular dna molecules 
this fraction. evidence indicates viral dna hp-fraction exists in
a complex protein possibly rna. protein component complex 
resistant enzymatic digestion, whereas complex susceptible to
ribonuclease treatment. digestion deoxyribonuclease reduces amount of
dna found hp-fraction. structure biological function this
complex currently investigated.
