human lactobacillus sp strain gg (lactobacillus gg) administered acute
rotavirus diarrhea shown promote clinical recovery. elucidate 
immune mechanisms behind favorable outcome, elispot (solid phase
enzyme-linked immunospot) assay ig- specific antibody-secreting cells
among circulating lymphocytes used, giving indirect evidence the
immunologic events gut. rehydration, 39 children acute
rotavirus diarrhea, mean age 16 (sd 6) mo, randomly received either a
lactobacillus gg fermented milk product (study group) pasteurized yogurt
(placebo group). duration diarrhea significantly shorter study 
group placebo group [mean 1.1 (sd 0.6) versus 2.5 (sd 1.4)d, p =
0.001]. lactobacillus gg therapy associated significantly enhanced
nonspecific humoral response acute phase infection, reflected
in igg, iga, igm ig-secreting cell numbers. convalescence, 90% 
study group versus 46% placebo group developed iga specific
antibody-secreting cell response rotavirus (p = 0.006). results indicate
that lactobacillus gg promotes recovery rotavirus diarrhea via augmentation 
of local immune defense. furthermore, specific iga response rotavirus is
endorsed, possibly relevant protection reinfections.
