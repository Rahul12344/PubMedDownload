a highly sensitive specific real-time (rt) rt-pcr assay developed
for rapid, simultaneous detection three strains cetacean morbillivirus
(cemv). assay, two pcr primers hydrolysis probe commercially
available universal probe library (upl) used amplify highly conserved
region within fusion protein gene. rt-pcr carried sample
using two primer sets parallel: one set detects virulent strains,
dolphin morbillivirus (dmv) porpoise morbillivirus (pmv), set
detects least virulent least common strain, pilot whale morbillivirus
(pwmv). sensitivity analysis using dilute samples containing purified dmv, pmv
and pwmv showed viral rna detection limits upl rt-pcr assay were
lower conventional rt-pcr assay. method gave amplification
signal field samples positive viruses related unrelated cemv,
such phocine distemper virus (pdv). reliability robustness upl 
rt-pcr assay verified using tissue samples previously analyzed by
conventional methods, well panel clinical samples suspected of
containing cemv. using upl rt-pcr assay, able associate dmv a
mass stranding striped dolphins spanish mediterranean 2011 with
greater reliability possible conventional rt-pcr method. these
results suggest upl rt-pcr method sensitive specific than
the conventional approach, may affordable rapid test for
routine diagnosis three cemv strains.
