a screening human proteins capable interacting influenza virus ns1
has carried using two-hybrid genetic trap yeast. cdna
corresponding human homologue drosophila melanogaster staufen protein
(hstaufen) isolated fulfilled genetic controls two-hybrid
protocol. using hstaufen cdna isolated lambda human library, the
interaction hstaufen ns1 proteins characterised vivo vitro. 
co-transfection ns1 cdna partial cdna hstaufen led the
relocalisation recombinant hstaufen protein normal accumulation site 
in cytoplasm nuclear location ns1 protein. ns1 hstaufen
proteins could co-immunoprecipitated extracts co-transfected cells and
from mixtures extracts containing either protein, well extracts 
influenza virus-infected cells. furthermore, proteins co-localised the
ribosomal polysomal fractions influenza virus-infected cells. the
interaction also detected pull-down experiments using resin containing
purified hstaufen ns1 protein translated vitro. deletion mapping the
ns1 gene indicated mutant protein containing n-terminal 81 amino acids
is unable interact hstaufen, spite retaining full rna-binding
capacity. results discussed relation possible mechanisms of
action hstaufen relevance influenza virus infection.
