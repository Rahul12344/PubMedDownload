formation specific complex hiv tat protein small rna
element tar critical activation viral transcription. model complex
for interaction composed hiv-2 tar amide derivative arginine
has developed study tat tar interact specifically. have
previously determined high resolution nmr structure hiv-2
tar-argininamide complex. argininamide guanidium group hydrogen bonds 
major groove face g26 stacked u23 a22, forming arginine 
sandwich. structure also provided evidence formation u38-a27.u38
base triple, u23 positioned major groove within hydrogen bonding
distance a27. however, expected u23 imino proton observed,
preventing unambiguous identification base triple. previous work an
isomorphic c38-g27.c23+ base triple mutant three base bulge hiv-1
tar-argininamide complex demonstrated base triple required for
specific argininamide binding. investigate c38-g27.c23+ base
triple mutant context two base bulge hiv-2 tar. improved nmr
spectral properties hiv-2 tar allowed observation c23 amino imino
protons first time, providing direct evidence hydrogen bonding
interaction occurring. noes observed correspond observed the
high resolution structure hiv-2 tar-argininamide complex, confirming 
a base triple important feature tar-argininamide interaction.
