intraphagocytic degradation group streptococci: electron microsopic studies.

ayoub em, white jg.

the morphological changes occur intraphagocytic digestion group 
streptococci studied electron microscopy first evidence of
degradation ingested organism appearance reticular changes in
the bacterial endoplasm. followed gradual swelling dissolution of
the bacterial wall, final degradation constitutuents to
electron-dense debris. accompanying changes phagocytic cell observed;
they consisted vacuole formation, fusion lysosomes wall the
yacuole, release lysosomal contents vacuole, aggregation of
the lysosomal contents around ingested organism. changes morphology of
the organism similar observed intraphagocytic digestion also
obtained subjecting streptococcal cells action phage-associated 
lysin.
