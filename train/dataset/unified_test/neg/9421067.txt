five cases adenoid basal carcinoma (abc) uterine cervix examined
for presence p53 tumor suppressor gene, k-ras-2 oncogene, human
papillomavirus (hpv). topographic genotyping approach used search for
point mutations k-ras-2 (exon 1 2) p53 (exons 5 8) archival
formalin-fixed tissue blocks. minute target sites selected polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) amplified directly sequenced tissue sections. tissue
sections additionally subjected immunohistochemical staining p53 
waf-1 protein. wild type p53 induces waf-1 gene expression,
immunohistochemical staining waf-1 protein using monoclonal antibodies may
serve indirect means test p53 mutational damage. mutational genotype
was compared histopathologic features immunohistochemical staining. to
study role hpv, l1 region consensus primers used amplify
topographic samples, followed hpv genotyping direct sequencing and
comparison known viral strains. abc found contain hpv cases,
proven genotyping hpv type 16 case. virus showed evidence
of genomic variation prototype hpv type 16 l1 segment examined. no
k-ras-2 point mutations identified. p53 immunopositivity present 
tumors, weak focal 4 strong diffuse 1. waf-1
immunostaining positive two tumors showing weak focal p53
immunopositivity. single strong diffuse p53 immunopositive tumor was
negative waf-1 shown contain missense p53 point mutation (exon
7-codon 248 tryptophan). conclusion, abc characterized presence of
hpv type 16. k-ras-2 point mutation appears play role development of
this tumor. p53 gene alterations common including wild type hyperexpression
(weak focal p53 immunopositivity, waf-1 positivity, mutational change) p53
point mutational damage.
