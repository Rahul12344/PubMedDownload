hepatitis e virus (hev) infection emerged global health issue, no
approved medication available. nucleoside analogue 2'-c-methylcytidine
(2cmc), viral polymerase inhibitor, shown inhibit infection 
variety viruses, including hepatitis c virus (hcv). here, report 2cmc 
significantly inhibits replication hev subgenomic replication model
and system using full-length infectious virus. importantly, long-term
treatment 2cmc result loss antiviral potency, indicating a
high barrier drug resistance development. however, combination 2cmc
with ribavirin, off-label treatment hev, exerts antagonistic effects. 
results indicate 2cmc serves potential antiviral drug hev
infection.
