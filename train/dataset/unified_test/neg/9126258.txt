it found fusion (his)6-movement proteins (mps) two tobamoviruses 
(tmv ui crucifer-infecting tobamovirus, crtmv) efficient nonspecific
translational repressors. vitro translation viral rnas blocked by
incomplete 30k mp-rna complexes formed mp:rna molar ratios 100-150:1.
similar results obtained barley stripe mosaic hordeivirus
(bsmv)-encoded 58k mp; however, translation inhibiting activity 58k mp
was manifested presence magnesium. contrast, 25k mp of
potato virus x (pvx) incapable forming mp-rna complexes experimental
conditions used inhibit vitro translation. translation
repressing ability correlated level mp affinity rna. complexes
of 30k mp 58k mp tmv rna infectious isolated
protoplasts; however, infectious indicator plants. reduction mp
affinity rna resulted translatability mp-tmv rna complexes that
apparently due destabilization. thus, deletion mutant del4 mp
formed mp-tmv rna complexes translatable vitro, infectious to
protoplasts plants. contrast this, complexes tmv rna the
mammalian rna-binding protein p50 nontranslatable noninfectious to
either protoplasts intact plants. results implied nontranslatable
mp-rna complexes could replicate primary infected cells were
converted translatable replicatable form course passage
through plasmodesmata planta.
