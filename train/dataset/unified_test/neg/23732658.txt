human adenovirus ad36 increases adiposity several animal models, including
rodents non-human primates. importantly, ad36 associated human
obesity, prompted research understand epidemiology to
develop vaccine prevent subgroup obesity. purpose,
understanding genomic stability ad36 vivo vitro infections is
critical. here, examined whether vitro cell passaging 14-year period
introduced genetic variation ad36. sequenced whole genome of
ad36-which plaque purified 1998 original strain obtained from
american type culture collection, passaged approximately 12 times the
past 14 years (ad36-2012). dna sequence compared previously
published sequence ad36 likely obtained source (ad36-1988).
compared ad36-1988, two nucleotides altered ad36-2012: t
insertion nucleotide 1862, may induce early termination e1b viral
protein, t➝c transition nucleotide 26 136. virus insertion
(designated ad36-2012-t6) mixed wild-type virus lacking insertion 
(designated ad36-2012-t5) viral stock. transition nucleotide 26 136
does change encoded amino acid (aspartic acid) pviii viral
protein. rate genetic variation ad36 ∼2.37 × 10(-6)
mutations/nucleotide/passage. particular importance, mutations
in e4orf1 gene, critical gene producing obesity. this
very-low-variation rate reduce concerns genetic variability when
developing ad36 vaccines developing assays detecting ad36 infection in
populations.
