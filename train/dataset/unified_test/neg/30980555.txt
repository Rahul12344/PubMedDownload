this study experimentally examines compares dynamics short-term
events airborne cross-infection full-scale room ventilated stratum,
mixing displacement air distributions. two breathing thermal manikins were
employed simulate standing infected person standing exposed person.
four influential factors examined, including separation distance between
manikins, air change per hour, positioning two manikinsand air
distribution. tracer gas technique used simulate exhaled droplet
nuclei infected person fast tracer gas concentration meters (fcm41) 
were used monitor concentrations. real-time average exposure indices
were proposed evaluate dynamics airborne exposure. time-averaged
exposure index depends duration exposure time considerably
different short-term events steady-state conditions. the
exposure risk short-term events may always decrease increasing
separation distance. changes time may always increase time. 
these findings imply control measures formulated basis of
steady-state conditions necessarily appropriate short-term events.
