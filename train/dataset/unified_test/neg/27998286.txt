background: although next generation sequencing (ngs) offers potential for
studying virus populations unprecedented depth, pcr error, amplification bias 
and recombination library construction limited use population 
sequencing measurements unlinked allele frequencies. report a
method, termed ultrasensitive single-genome sequencing (usgs), ngs library
construction analysis eliminates pcr errors recombinants, and
generates single-genome sequences quality "gold-standard" of
hiv-1 single-genome sequencing assay 100-fold greater depth.
results: primer id tagged cdna synthesized mixtures cloned bh10
wild-type mutant hiv-1 transcripts containing ten drug resistance mutations. 
first, resultant cdna divided ngs libraries generated in
parallel using two methods: usgs method applying long pcr primers attach
the ngs adaptors (lp-pcr-1). second, cdna divided ngs libraries were
generated parallel comparing 3 methods: usgs 2 methods adapted more
recent reports using variations long pcr primers attach adaptors
(lp-pcr-2 lp-pcr-3). consistently, usgs method amplified greater
proportion cdnas, averaging 30% compared 13% lp-pcr-1, 21% lp-pcr-2
and 14% lp-pcr-3. importantly, usgs sequences binned
according primer ids, 94% bins contain pcr recombinant
sequences versus 55, 75 65% lp-pcr-1, 2 3, respectively.
finally, usgs applied plasma samples hiv-1 infected donors, both
frequent rare variants detected sample neighbor-joining
trees revealed clusters genomes driven linkage mutations,
showing lack pcr recombinants datasets.
conclusions: usgs assay used accurate detection rare variants
and identifying linkage rare alleles associated hiv-1 drug
resistance. addition, method allows accurate in-depth analyses the
complex genetic relationships viral populations vivo.
