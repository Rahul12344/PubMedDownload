stilbenoids including resveratrol contain basic structural unit of
1,2-diphenylethylene. naturally occurring stilbenoids broad structural
features due oligomerization modifications demonstrated
potent biological activities. effort identify bioactive stilbenoids, 
screened group dimeric oligomeric stilbenoids hsv-1 hsv-2
infection. several trimeric tetrameric derivatives showed anti-herpetic
activity single digit micromolar concentrations. hsv-1 hsv-2 replication
requires nf-κb mapk activation. compounds showed inhibitory
activity nf-κb erk/mapk activation, instead compounds promoted 
rapid transient release reactive oxygen species (ros). addition of
n-acetylcysteine (nac), scavenger ros, reversed inhibitory effect of
those compounds hsv replication. addition identification of
resveratrol derivatives potent anti-hsv activity, results uncover a
mechanism polyphenol-mediated anti-hsv response, linking anti-herpetic
activity oligomeric stilbenoids innate immunity.
