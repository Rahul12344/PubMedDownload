simple methods measuring levels serum antibody canine
distemper virus (cdv) would assist effective vaccination dogs. to
develop enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) specific cdv, we
expressed hydrophilic extra-viral domain (hevd) protein a75/17-cdv h gene 
in pet 28a plasmid-based escherichia (e.) coli vector system. expression was
confirmed dot western blotting. proposed detection e.
coli-expressed h protein might conformation- dependent intensities 
the reactions observed two methods varied. h gene hevd protein was
further purified used antigen elisa. samples dogs with
undetectable high anti-cdv antibody titers analyzed using this
hevd-specific elisa commercial cdv antibody detection kit (immunocomb).
levels hevd antigenicity measured assays immunochromatography
correlated. data indicated hedv protein may used antigen 
develop techniques detecting antibodies cdv.
