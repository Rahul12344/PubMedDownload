organ culture studies efficiency infection chicken tissues with
avian infectious bronchitis virus.

darbyshire jh, cook jk, peters rw.

long-term organ cultures range tissues collected specific
pathogen-free chickens employed determine susceptibility, their
capacity subsequent virus production, following inoculation avian
infectious bronchitis (aib) virus. inoculated approximately 2-0 log10
median ciliostatic doses (cd50) classical highly egg-adapted vaccine strain 
(h120) aib virus, 9 23 tissues shown susceptible, namely the
nasal turbinates, trachea, air sac membranes,lungsasal turbinates, trachea, air
sac membranes, lungs, proventriculus mucosa, thyroid, kidney, ovary oviduct. 
when remaining 14 tissues inoculated high dose virus (6.8
log10 cd50), conjunctiva, caecel tonsil, testis bursa fabricius were
susceptible whereas oesophagus cloaca responded minimally. inoculation of
the range tissues high low dose field strain (hvi9) aib
virus produced similar results, except number individual variations in
response, due possibly strain differences pathogenicity. determinations 
the minimal infectious dose requirements susceptible tissues revealed that
the efficiency infection h120 strain highest nasal
turbinate tracheal tissues, thereafter, order decreasing
efficiency, air sac membranes, lung, oviduct, proventriculus mucosa,
conjunctiva, kidney, ovary, bursa fabricius, thyroid, testis, caecal tonsil,
cloaca oesophagus. relevance results discussed connection 
with early events pathogenesis clinical syndrome aib
