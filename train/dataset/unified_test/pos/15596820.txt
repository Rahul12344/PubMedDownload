herpesviruses encode set core proteins essential lytic replication of
their genomes. three proteins form tripartite helix-primase complex
that, case epstein-barr virus (ebv), consists helicase bblf4,
the primase bslf1, linker protein bblf2/3. bblf2/3 homologs in
the herpesviruses remain relatively poorly characterized. better
understand contribution replication made bblf2/3, yeast two-hybrid
screen performed bblf2/3 bait protein. screen identified 
interactors number cell replication-related proteins dna polymerase 
beta subunits dna polymerase delta along ebv-encoded dnase bglf5.
the screen also identified dna binding zinc finger protein zbrk1 the
zbrk1 corepressor kap-1 bblf2/3 interactors. interaction bblf2/3 and
zbrk1 kap-1 confirmed coimmunoprecipitation assays. binding site for
zbrk1 ebv orilyt enhancer identified electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. zbrk1, kap-1, zbrk1 binding protein brca1 shown indirect
immunofluorescence present replication compartments lytically induced
d98-hr1 cells, additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays determined 
that proteins associated orilyt dna. replication orilyt plasmid 
and variant orilyt (deltazbrk1) plasmid examined lytically induced
d98-hr1 cells. exogenous zbrk1, kap-1, brca1 increased efficiency of
orilyt replication, deletion zbrk1 binding site impaired
replication. experiments identify zbrk1 another cell protein that,
through bblf2/3, provides tethering point orilyt ebv replication
complex. data also suggest bblf2/3 may serve contact interface 
cell proteins involved replication ebv orilyt.
