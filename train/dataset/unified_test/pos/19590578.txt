detection viral nucleic acids central antiviral immunity. recently,
dai/zbp1 (dna-dependent activator irfs/z-dna binding protein 1) identified
as cytoplasmic dna sensor shown activate interferon regulatory
factor (irf) nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) transcription factors,
leading type-i interferon production. dai-induced irf activation depends on
tank-binding kinase 1 (tbk1), whereas signalling pathways molecular
components involved nf-kappab activation remain elusive. here, report the
identification two receptor-interacting protein (rip) homotypic interaction
motifs (rhims) dai protein sequence, show domains relay
dai-induced nf-kappab signals recruitment rhim-containing
kinases rip1 rip3. show knockdown rip1, also rip3
affects dai-induced nf-kappab activation. importantly, rip recruitment dai 
inhibited rhim-containing murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) protein m45. these
findings delineate dai signalling pathway nf-kappab suggest possible
new immune modulation strategy mcmv.
