long pentraxin ptx3 potent innate inhibitor influenza viruses in
vitro vivo. human murine ptx3 bound influenza virus mediated 
range antiviral activities, including inhibition hemagglutination,

ptx3 rapidly induced following influenza infection ptx3-/- mice
were susceptible wild-type mice infection ptx3-sensitive virus
strains. therapeutic treatment mice human ptx3 promoted survival and
reduced viral load lungs following infection ptx3-sensitive, 
ptx3-resistant, influenza viruses. together, studies describe novel
antiviral role ptx3 early host defense influenza infections both
in vitro vivo describe therapeutic potential ptx3 in
ameliorating disease influenza infection.
