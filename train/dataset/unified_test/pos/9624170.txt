nef membrane-associated cytoplasmic phosphoprotein well conserved
among different human (hiv-1 hiv-2) simian immunodeficiency viruses
and important roles down-regulating cd4 receptor modulating t-cell
signaling pathways. ability modulate t-cell signaling pathways suggests
that nef may physically interact t-cell signaling proteins. order to
identify nef binding proteins map site(s) interaction, targeted a
highly conserved acidic sequence carboxyl-terminal region nef sharing
striking similarity acidic sequence c-raf1-binding site within the
ras effector region. here, used deletion site-specific mutagenesis to
generate mutant nef proteins fused bacterial glutathione s-transferase in
vitro precipitation assays immunoblot analysis map specific
interaction hiv-1lai nef c-raf1 conserved acidic sequence
motif containing core sequence asp-asp-x-x-x-glu (position 174-179).
significantly, demonstrate substitution nonpolar glycine residue
for either conserved negatively charged aspartic acid residues 
positions 174 175 full-length recombinant nef protein background
completely abrogated binding c-raf1 vitro. addition, lysates a
permanent cem t-cell line constitutively expressing native hiv-1 nef protein 
was used coimmunoprecipitate stable nef-c-raf1 complex, suggesting that
molecular interactions nef c-raf1, important downstream transducer
of cell signaling c-raf1-map kinase pathway, occur vivo. this
interaction may account nef-induced perturbations t-cell signaling and
activation pathways vitro vivo.
