in b lymphocytes induced proliferate vitro epstein-barr virus (ebv),
extra-chromosomal viral episomes packaged chromatin persist nucleus,
and productive cycle. switch latency productive
cycle observed induced expression ebv bzlf1 gene product, the
transcription factor eb1. present evidence that, latency, proteins of
the myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (mef2) family bound bzlf1
promoter recruit class ii histone deacetylases. furthermore, propose 
latency determined primarily specific local recruitment class ii
histone deacetylase (hdac) mef2d bzlf1 gene promoter. switch from
latency productive cycle could due part post-translational
modification mef2 proteins changes local acetylation state the
chromatin.
