the epstein-barr virus (ebv) latent membrane protein 2 (lmp2) expressed in
latently ebv-infected b cells, forms patches plasma membrane 
interferes b-cell receptor signal transduction dominant-negative
effects protein kinases. lmp2 transcripts detected nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, epithelial-cell malignancy. study function lmp2a 
epithelial cells investigated. lmp2a found coprecipitate protein 
kinase activities become phosphorylated vitro kinase assays.
analysis lmp2a deletion mutants demonstrated tyrosines implicated in
interacting src family kinase sh2 domains sh2 domain csk, well
as lmp2a immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, important for
its phosphorylation epithelial cells. lmp2a tyrosine phosphorylation was
triggered cell adhesion extracellular-matrix (ecm) proteins. src family
kinases, whose involvement cell-ecm signaling lmp2a phosphorylation b
lymphocytes well established, found responsible lmp2a
phosphorylation epithelial cells. instead, coexpression csk, negative src
regulator, lmp2a led increase lmp2a phosphorylation in
nonadherent cells upon cell adhesion. csk also phosphorylated lmp2a vitro.
these results suggest lmp2a different role epithelial cells, 
it interacts cell adhesion-initiated signaling pathways. although tyrosine
phosphorylation lmp2a occurs cell types, different protein kinases
seem used: src family kinases b lymphocytes csk epithelial cells.
