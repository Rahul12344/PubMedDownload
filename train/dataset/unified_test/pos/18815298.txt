borna disease virus (bdv) one infectious agents causes diseases of
the central nervous system wide range vertebrate species and, perhaps, in
humans. phosphoprotein (p) bdv, essential cofactor virus
rna-dependent rna polymerase, required virus replication. study,
we identified gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (gabarap)
with functions neurobiology one viral p protein-interacting cellular
factors using approach phage display-based protein-protein interaction
analysis. direct binding gabarap p protein confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation, protein pull-down, mammalian two-hybrid analyses.
gabarap originally identified linker gamma-aminobutyric acid
receptor (gabar) microtubule regulate receptor trafficking plays
important roles regulation inhibitory neural transmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba). showed gabarap colocalizes p protein
in cells infected bdv transfected p gene, resulted 
shifting localization gabarap cytosol nucleus. 
demonstrated p protein blocks trafficking gabar, principal
gaba-gated ion channel plays important roles neural transmission, 
surface cells infected bdv transfected p gene. proposed
that bdv infection, p protein binds gabarap, shifts distribution of
gabarap cytoplasm nucleus, disrupts trafficking gabars
to cell membranes, may result inhibition gaba-induced
currents enhancement hyperactivity anxiety.
