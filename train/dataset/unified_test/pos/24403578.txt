the nonstructural protein nss main virulence factor rift valley fever
virus (rvfv; family bunyaviridae, genus phlebovirus), serious pathogen of
livestock humans africa. rvfv nss blocks transcriptional upregulation of
antiviral type interferons (ifn) destroys general transcription factor 
tfiih subunit p62 via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. here, identified a
subunit e3 ubiquitin ligases, f-box protein fbxo3, host cell interactor
of nss. small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated depletion fbxo3 rescued p62
protein levels rvfv-infected cells elevated ifn transcription 1 order
of magnitude. nss interacts full-length fbxo3 protein well 
truncated isoform lacks c-terminal acidic poly(r)-rich domains.
these isoforms present nucleus cytoplasm. nss exclusively
removes nuclear pool full-length fbxo3, likely due consumption during
the degradation process. f-box proteins form variable substrate recognition
subunit so-called scf ubiquitin ligases, also contain constant
components skp1, cullin 1 (or cullin 7), rbx1. sirna knockdown skp1 also
protected p62 degradation, suggesting involvement nss action. however,
knockdown cullin 1, cullin 7, rbx1 could rescue p62 degradation nss.
our data show enzymatic removal p62 via host cell factor fbxo3 is
a major mechanism ifn suppression rvfv.importance: rift valley fever virus 
is serious emerging pathogen animals humans. main virulence factor, 
nss, enables unhindered virus replication suppressing antiviral innate
immune system. identified e3 ubiquitin ligase fbxo3 novel host cell
interactor nss. nss recruits fbxo3 destroy general host cell
transcription factor tfiih-p62, resulting suppression transcriptional
upregulation innate immunity.
