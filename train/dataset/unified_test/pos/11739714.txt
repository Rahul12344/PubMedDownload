epstein-barr virus (ebv) latent infection membrane protein 1 (lmp1) an
intermediate domain two cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domains that
are critical transforming b-lymphocytes lymphoblastoid cell lines
(lcls). intermediate domain implicated janus kinase 3 (jak3)
association activation. find lcls transformed ebv recombinants
that express flag-lmp1 putative jak3 binding activating intermediate
domain deleted lcls transformed flag-lmp1 ebv recombinants similar
levels phosphotyrosine-activated jak3, signal transducer activator of
transcription 3 (stat3), stat5 similar low levels jak3 associated 
with lmp1. further, transient flag-lmp1 expression b-lymphoma cell line
transduces signals upregulate traf1 levels alter jak3 levels or
activation state. although data indicate lmp1 putative jak3
binding activating intermediate domain mediate jak3 association or
activation b-lymphocytes, jak3 association lmp1 could significant,
particularly cells lmp1, jak3, jak3-associated protein is
expressed high levels.
