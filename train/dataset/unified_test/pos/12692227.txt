the papillomavirus life cycle closely linked differentiation program of
the host keratinocyte. thus, late gene expression viral maturation are
restricted terminally differentiated keratinocytes. variety cellular
transcription factors including c/ebp family involved the
regulation keratinocyte differentiation. study show the
papillomavirus transcription factor e2 cooperates c/ebpalpha -beta in
transcriptional activation. synergism independent e2 binding site.
e2 c/ebp factors synergistically transactivated synthetic promoter
construct containing classical c/ebpbeta sites c/ebpalpha-responsive
proximal promoter involucrin gene, naturally expressed in
differentiating keratinocytes. c/ebpalpha -beta coprecipitated e2
proteins derived human papillomavirus type 8 (hpv8), hpv16, hpv18, and
bovine papillomavirus type 1 vitro vivo, indicating complex formation
by cellular viral factors. interaction domains could mapped the
c terminus e2 amino acids 261 302 located within bzip motif of
c/ebpbeta. data suggest e2, via interaction c/ebp factors, may 
contribute enhancing keratinocyte differentiation, suppressed 
viral oncoproteins e6 e7 hpv-induced lesions.
