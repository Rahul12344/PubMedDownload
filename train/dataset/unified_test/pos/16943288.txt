hepatitis b virus (hbv) leading cause liver disease hepatocellular
carcinoma; 400 million people chronically infected hbv. specific
anti-hbv treatments, like antivirals, target enzymes similar to
host proteins. virus capsid protein human homolog, making assembly a
promising undeveloped therapeutic target. hap1 [methyl
4-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-6-methyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5-car
boxylate], heteroaryldihydropyrimidine, potent hbv capsid assembly
activator misdirector. knowledge structural basis activity
would directly benefit development capsid-targeting therapeutic
strategies. report details crystal structures icosahedral hbv capsids
with without hap1. show hap1 leads global structural changes by
movements subunits connected rigid bodies. observed movements cause the
fivefold vertices protrude liganded capsid, threefold vertices to
open, quasi-sixfold vertices flatten, explaining effects hap1
on assembled capsids assembly process. identified likely
hap1-binding site bridges elements secondary structure within a
capsid-bound monomer, offering explanation assembly activation. site
also interferes interactions capsid proteins, leading quaternary 
changes presumably assembly misdirection. results demonstrate the
plasticity hbv capsids molecular basis tenable antiviral
strategy.
