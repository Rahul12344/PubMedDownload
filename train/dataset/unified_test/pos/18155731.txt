the epidemic outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) 2003 was
caused novel coronavirus (cov), designated sars-cov. rna genome of
sars-cov complexed nucleocapsid protein (n) form helical
nucleocapsid. besides primary function, n seems involved apoptotic 
scenarios. show upon infection vero e6 cells sars-cov, which
elicits pronounced cytopathic effect high viral titer, n cleaved by
caspases. contrast, sars-cov-infected caco-2 cells, show moderate
cytopathic effect low viral titer, processing n observed.
to verify observations, transiently expressed n different
cell lines. caco-2 n2a cells served models persistent sars-cov
infection, whereas vero e6 a549 cells prototype cell lines lytically
infected sars-cov. experiments revealed n induces intrinsic
apoptotic pathway, resulting processing n residues 400 403 by
caspase-6 and/or caspase-3. note, caspase activation highly cell type
specific sars-cov-infected well transiently transfected cells. caco-2
and n2a cells, almost n-processing detectable. vero e6 a549 cells, 
a high proportion n cleaved caspases. moreover, examined the
subcellular localization sars-cov n cell lines. transfected vero
e6 a549 cells, sars-cov n localized cytoplasm nucleus,
whereas caco-2 n2a cells, nearly nuclear localization observed. 
addition, studies indicate nuclear localization n essential
for caspase-6-mediated cleavage. data suggest correlation among the
replication cycle sars-cov, subcellular localization n, induction of
apoptosis, subsequent activation caspases leading cleavage n.
