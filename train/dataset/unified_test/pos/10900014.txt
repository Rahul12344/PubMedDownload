the 5'-untranslated region hepatitis c virus (hcv) highly conserved, folds 
into complex secondary structure, functions internal ribosome entry
site (ires) initiate translation hcv proteins. developed a
selection system based randomized hairpin ribozyme gene library identify 
cellular factors involved hcv ires function. retroviral vector ribozyme
library randomized target recognition sequences introduced hela
cells, stably expressing bicistronic construct encoding hygromycin b
phosphotransferase gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene
(hsv-tk). translation hsv-tk gene mediated hcv ires. cells
expressing ribozymes inhibit hcv ires-mediated translation hsv-tk were
selected via resistance ganciclovir hygromycin b. two ribozymes
reproducibly conferred ganciclovir-resistant phenotype shown to
inhibit ires-mediated translation hcv core protein inhibit
cap-dependent protein translation cell growth. functional targets these
ribozymes identified gamma subunits human eukaryotic initiation
factors 2b (eif2bgamma) 2 (eif2gamma), respectively. involvement of
eif2bgamma eif2gamma hcv ires-mediated translation validated
by ribozymes directed additional sites within mrnas genes.
in addition leading identification cellular ires cofactors,
ribozymes obtained cellular selection system could directly used 
specifically inhibit hcv viral translation, thereby facilitating development 
of new antiviral strategies hcv infection.
