human α-defensins potent anti-microbial peptides ability to
neutralize bacterial viral targets. single alanine mutagenesis used 
to identify determinants anti-bacterial activity binding bacterial
proteins anthrax lethal factor. similar analyses α-defensin
interactions non-enveloped viruses limited. used comprehensive set 
of human α-defensin 5 (hd5) human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp1) alanine scan
mutants combination binding neutralization assays human
adenovirus (adv) human papillomavirus (hpv). identified core of
critical hydrophobic residues common determinants the
virus-defensin interactions analyzed, specificity viral
recognition conferred specific surface-exposed charged residues. the
hydrophobic residues serve multiple roles maintaining tertiary and
quaternary structure defensins well forming interface virus
binding. many important solvent-exposed residues hd5 group together 
form critical surface. however, single discrete binding face not
identified hnp1. lieu whole adv, used recombinant capsid subunit
comprised penton base fiber quantitative binding studies determined
that anti-viral potency hd5 function stoichiometry rather than
affinity. studies support mechanism α-defensins depend on
hydrophobic charge-charge interactions bind high copy number these
non-enveloped viruses neutralize infection provide insight properties
that guide α-defensin anti-viral activity.
