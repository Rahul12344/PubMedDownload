adenoviruses (ad) early region e4 deleted (e4-deleted virus) are
defective dna replication late protein synthesis. infection with
e4-deleted viruses results activation dna damage response, accumulation
of cellular repair factors foci viral replication centers, joining
together viral genomes concatemers. cellular dna repair complex
composed mre11, rad50, nbs1 (mrn) required concatemer formation and
full activation damage signaling protein kinases
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) atm-rad3-related (atr). e4orf3 and
e4orf6 proteins expressed e4 region ad type 5 (ad5) inactivate the
mrn complex degradation mislocalization, prevent dna damage
response. investigated individual contributions mrn complex,
concatemer formation, damage signaling viral dna replication during
infection e4-deleted virus. using virus mutants, short hairpin rna knockdown
and hypomorphic cell lines, show inactivation mrn results increased
viral replication. demonstrate defective replication absence e4
is due concatemer formation dna damage signaling. c terminus of
nbs1 required inhibition ad dna replication recruitment mrn 
to viral replication centers. identified regions nbs1 are
differentially required concatemer formation inhibition ad dna
replication. results demonstrate targeting mrn complex explains
the redundant functions e4orf3 e4orf6 promoting ad dna replication.
understanding mrn impacts adenoviral life cycle provide insights
into functions dna damage sensor.
