epstein-barr virus (ebv)-encoded ebna3c one latent proteins essential
for efficient transformation human primary b lymphocytes continuously
proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) vitro manipulation a
number major cellular pathways. although direct dna-binding
activity, ebna3c plays central role transcriptional modulation wide
range viral cellular genes latent infection. recently, we
showed ebna3c directly bind tumor suppressor protein p53 and
repress functions, part blocking transcriptional activity well
as facilitating degradation stabilization negative regulator, 
mdm2. study, showed ebna3c negatively regulate
p53-mediated functions interacting regulatory proteins, inhibitor
of growth family proteins ing4 ing5, shown frequently deregulated in
different cancers. functional mapping revealed ing4 ing5 bound to
n-terminal domain residues 129 200 ebna3c, previously
demonstrated associate p53 also essential lcl growth. in
addition, showed conserved domain either ing4 ing5 bound 
p53 ebna3c competitive manner, suggesting potential role ebna3c
whereby ing4 -5/p53 pathway modulated ebv-infected cells.
subsequently, demonstrated ebna3c significantly suppresses ing4-
and ing5-mediated regulation p53 transcriptional activity dose-dependent 
manner. colony formation assay well apoptosis assay showed ebna3c
nullified negative regulatory effects cell proliferation induced by
coupled expression p53 presence either ing4 ing5 saos-2
(p53(-/-)) cells. report demonstrates possible role candidate
tumor suppressor ing genes biology ebv-associated cancers.
