human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) causative agent an
aggressive malignancy cd4+ lymphocytes. since viral transactivator tax-1
is major player t-cell transformation, targeting tax-1 protein regarded
as possible strategy arrest viral replication counteract neoplastic
transformation. demonstrate ciita, master regulator major
histocompatibility complex class ii gene transcription, inhibits htlv-1
replication blocking transactivating function tax-1 when
exogenously transfected 293t cells endogenously expressed subset
of u937 promonocytic cells. tax-1 ciita physically interact vivo via the
first 108 amino acids tax-1 two ciita adjacent regions (amino acids 1 to
252 253 410). interestingly, ciita 1-252 mediated tax-1 inhibition,
in agreement fact ciita residues positions 64 124 were
required block tax-1 transactivation. ciita inhibitory action tax-1
correlated nuclear localization ciita independent the
transcription factor nf-yb, previously involved ciita-mediated inhibition of
tax-2 htlv-2. instead, ciita severely impaired physical functional
interaction tax-1 cellular coactivators p300/cbp-associated factor
(pcaf), cyclic amp-responsive element binding protein (creb), activating
transcription factor 1 (atf1), required optimal activation of
htlv-1 promoter. accordingly, overexpression pcaf, creb, atf1 restored
tax-1-dependent transactivation viral long-terminal-repeat promoter
inhibited ciita. findings strongly support original observation that
ciita, beside increasing antigen-presenting function pathogen antigens,
acts endogenous restriction factor human retroviruses blocking
virus replication spreading.
