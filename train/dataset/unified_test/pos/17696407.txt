kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, also known human herpesvirus 8, is
closely associated several cancers including kaposi's sarcoma, primary
effusion lymphoma, multicentric castleman's disease. rightmost end the
kshv genome encodes protein, k15, multiple membrane-spanning segments 
an intracellular carboxy-terminal tail contains several conserved motifs
with potential recruit interaction domains (i.e., sh2, sh3, traf) host 
cell proteins. k15 implicated downregulating b cell receptor (bcr)
signaling conserved motifs may thereby play role maintaining
viral latency and/or preventing apoptosis infected b cells. however, k15's
mode action largely unknown. used mass spectrometry, domain and
peptide arrays, surface plasmon resonance identify binding partners 
conserved proline-rich sequence (pplp) k15 cytoplasmic tail. show 
the pplp motif selectively binds sh3-c domain endocytic adaptor
protein, intersectin 2 (itsn2). interaction observed vitro
and cells, k15 itsn2 colocalize discrete compartments within 
b cell. ability k15 associate itsn2 suggests new role the
k15 viral protein intracellular protein trafficking.
