background: severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (sars-cov)
spreads rapidly high case-mortality rate. nucleocapsid protein (np)
of sars-cov may critical pathogenicity. study sought discover 
host proteins interact sars-cov np.
results: using surface plasmon resonance biomolecular interaction analysis
(spr/bia) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight
(maldi-tof) mass spectrometry, found proteasome subunit p42 from
human fetal lung diploid fibroblast (2bs) cells bound sars-cov np. this
interaction confirmed glutathione s-transferase (gst) fusion protein
pulldown technique. co-localization signal sars-cov np proteasome
subunit p42 2bs cells detected using indirect immunofluorescence and
confocal microscopy. p42 subunit 26s proteasome; large,
multi-protein complex component ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which
is involved variety basic cellular processes inflammatory responses.
conclusion: knowledge, first report sars-cov np interacts
with proteasome subunit p42 within host cells. data enhance our
understanding molecular mechanisms sars-cov pathogenicity means
by sars-cov interacts host cells.
