the largest isoform adenovirus early region 1a (e1a) contains unique region 
termed conserved region 3 (cr3). region activates viral gene expression by
recruiting cellular transcription machinery early viral promoters. recent 
studies suggested optimal level e1a-dependent
transactivation required human adenovirus (had) infection this
may achieved via functional cross talk n termini e1a cr3.
the n terminus e1a binds gcn5, cellular lysine acetyltransferase (kat). we
have identified second independent interaction e1a gcn5 is
mediated cr3, requires residues 178 188 had5 e1a. gcn5 was
recruited viral genome infection e1a-dependent manner, and
this required gcn5 interaction sites e1a. ectopic expression gcn5
repressed transactivation e1a cr3 full-length e1a. contrast, rna
interference (rnai) depletion gcn5 treatment kat inhibitor
cyclopentylidene-[4-(4'-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl]hydrazone (cpth2) resulted in
increased e1a cr3 transactivation. moreover, activation adenovirus e4
promoter e1a increased infection homozygous gcn5 kat-defective
(hat/hat) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) compared wild-type control mefs. 
enhanced histone h3 k9/k14 acetylation viral e4 promoter required the
newly identified binding site gcn5 within cr3 correlated repression 
and reduced occupancy phosphorylated rna polymerase ii. treatment cpth2
during infection also reduced virus yield. data identify gcn5 new
negative regulator transactivation e1a suggest kat activity is
required optimal virus replication.
