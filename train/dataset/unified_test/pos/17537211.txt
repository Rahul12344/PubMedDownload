dengue virus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) large multifunctional protein
with central role viral replication. previously identified two nuclear
localization sequences (nlss) within central region dengue virus type-2
(denv-2) ns5 ('anls' 'bnls') recognized importin alpha/beta
and importin beta1 nuclear transporters, respectively. here, demonstrate the
importance kinetics ns5 nuclear localization virus production for
the first time show anls responsible. site-specific mutations 
the bipartite-type anls bnls region introduced reporter plasmid
encoding green fluorescent protein fused n-terminus denv-2 ns5, well
as denv-2 genomic length complementary dna. mutation basic residues in
the highly conserved region bnls affect nuclear import ns5. 
contrast, mutations either basic cluster anls decreased ns5 nuclear
accumulation reduced virus production, greatest reduction observed
for mutation second cluster (k(387)k(388)k(389)); mutagenesis both
clusters abolished ns5 nuclear import denv-2 virus production completely. the
latter appeared relate impaired ability virus lacking
nuclear-localizing ns5, compared wild-type virus expressing
nuclear-localizing ns5, reduce interleukin-8 production part the
antiviral response. results overall indicate ns5 nuclear localization
through anls integral viral infection, significant implications
for flaviviruses medical importance, yellow fever west nile 
viruses.
