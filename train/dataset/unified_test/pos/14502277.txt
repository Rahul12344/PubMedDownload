understanding process vector transduction important implications for
the application optimal use vector system human gene therapy. recent
studies vectors based adeno-associated virus type 5 (aav-5) shown
utility vector system lung, central nervous system, muscle and
eye. understand natural tropism virus identify proteins
necessary aav-5 transduction, characterized 43 cell lines permissive or
nonpermissive aav-5 transduction compared gene expression profiles
derived cdna microarray analyses cell lines. statistically
significant correlation observed expression platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (pdgfr-alpha-polypeptide) aav-5 transduction.
subsequent experiments confirmed role pdgfr-alpha pdgfr-beta as
receptors aav-5. tropism aav-5 vivo also correlated the
expression pattern pdgfr-alpha.
