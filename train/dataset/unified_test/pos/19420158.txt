jc virus (jcv) aetiological agent progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (pml), fatal, demyelinating disease brain affecting 
people aids. although immunosuppression involved infection the
brain jcv, direct influence human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
has also established. tat protein hiv-1 implicated in
activation cytokine transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta in
hiv-1-infected cells stimulating jcv gene transcription dna
replication oligodendroglia, primary central nervous system cell type
infected jcv pml. study demonstrated tat cooperate smad 
proteins, intracellular effectors tgf-beta, jcv dna control region 
(cr) stimulate jcv gene transcription. tat stimulated jcv early gene
transcription kg-1 oligodendroglial cells expressed via transfection or
added exogenously. using chromatin immunoprecipitation, shown that
exogenous tat enhanced binding smad2, -3 -4 binding partner
