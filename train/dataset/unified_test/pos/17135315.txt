mklp2 kinesin-like motor protein central mitotic spindle required for
completion cytokinesis. papillomavirus e2 sequence specific dna binding
protein regulates viral transcription replication responsible for
partitioning viral episomes daughter cells cell division. we
demonstrate mklp2 specifically associates e2 protein during
mitosis. using chromatin immunoprecipitation, show viral genomes in
complex mklp2 within stage cell cycle. immunofluorescence, a
subpopulation papillomavirus e2 colocalizes mklp2 midbody/midplate
during late mitosis. conclude specific stages mitosis, the
papillomavirus e2 protein binds mklp2, infer association this
motor protein ensures viral genome partitioning cytokinesis.
