japanese encephalitis virus (jev) mosquito-borne flavivirus kept 
a zoonotic transmission cycle pigs mosquitoes. jev causes infection
of central nervous system high mortality rate dead-end hosts,
including humans. many studies suggested flavivirus core protein is
not component nucleocapsids also important pathogenic
determinant. study, identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein
a2 (hnrnp a2) binding partner jev core protein pulldown
purification mass spectrometry. reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation analyses 
transfected infected cells confirmed specific interaction jev
core protein hnrnp a2. expression jev core protein induced cytoplasmic
retention hnrnp a2 jev subgenomic replicon cells. small interfering rna
(sirna)-mediated knockdown hnrnp a2 resulted 90% reduction viral rna
replication cells infected jev, reduction cancelled the
expression sirna-resistant hnrnp a2 mutant. addition core
protein, hnrnp a2 also associated jev nonstructural protein 5, has
both methyltransferase rna-dependent rna polymerase activities, 
5'-untranslated region negative-sense jev rna. one-step growth,
synthesis positive- negative-strand jev rnas delayed the
knockdown hnrnp a2. results suggest hnrnp a2 plays important
role replication jev rna interaction viral proteins
and rna.
