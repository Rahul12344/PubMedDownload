cancer cells may undergo loss alterations functions certain viruses
normally target promote virus replication. virus mutants lost the
targeting function(s) able grow cancer cells in
normal cells. "tumor host range" (t-hr) selection procedure devised
and applied polyoma virus based rationale. studies one t-hr mutant 
have led identification msal2 gene product (p150(sal2)) a
binding partner large antigen. msal2 encodes multizinc finger protein 
and putative transcription factor homologous drosophila homeotic gene
spalt. t-hr mutant encodes altered large protein fails interact 
with p150(sal2) defective replication tumor induction newborn
mice.
