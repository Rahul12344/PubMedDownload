chronic infection hepatitis b virus cause end-stage liver disease
and hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). previously screened fructose-bisphosphate 
aldolase b (aldob) candidate binding protein hepatitis b surface antigen 
(hbsag) using yeast 2-hybrid assay. study aimed confirm aldob 
a binding protein region hbsag (hbs) investigate the
function involved mechanism interactions hcc development. 
our results demonstrated exogenous endogenous aldob proteins
bind hbs colocalize cytoplasm vitro. coexistence hbs 
aldob inhibit apoptosis cisplatin-induced hepg2 cells. furthermore, western
blot analysis showed coexistence hbs aldob enhance the
phosphorylations akt downstream gsk-3Î² (phosphorylation); decreased
expression pro-apoptotic proteins bax, bid, bim, puma; increased
expression prosurvival proteins bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1 hepg2 cells.
these findings suggest interaction hbs aldob might applied as
a potential therapeutic target treatment hbv-related hepatitis or
hcc.
