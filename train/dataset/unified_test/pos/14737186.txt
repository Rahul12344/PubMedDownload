the infectious cycle primate lentiviruses intimately linked interactions
between cells immune system. nef, potent virulence factor, alters
cellular environments increase lentiviral replication host, yet the
mechanisms underlying effects remained elusive. since nef likely
functions adaptor protein, exploited proteomic approach directly
identify molecules nef targets subvert signaling machinery t
cells. purified near homogeneity major nef-associated protein complex
from cells identified mass spectroscopy subunits dock2-elmo1, a
key activator rac antigen- chemokine-initiated signaling pathways, 
rac. show nef activates rac cell lines primary cells
following infection hiv-1 absence antigenic stimuli. nef activates
rac binding dock2-elmo1 complex, interaction linked the
abilities nef inhibit chemotaxis promote cell activation. data
indicate nef targets critical switch regulates rac gtpases downstream
of chemokine- antigen-initiated signaling pathways. interaction enables 
nef influence multiple aspects cell function thus provides an
important mechanism nef impacts pathogenesis primate lentiviruses.
