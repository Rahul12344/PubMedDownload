infected cell protein 0 (icp0) herpes simplex virus 1, multifunctional ring 
finger protein, enhances expression genes introduced cells by
infection transfection, interacts numerous cellular viral proteins,
and associated degradation several cellular proteins. sequences
encoded exon 2 icp0 (residues 20-241) bind ubch3 (cdc34)
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, carboxy terminus expresses ubiquitin
ligase activity demonstrable polyubiquitylation cdc34 vitro. report
that: (i) physical interaction cdc34 icp0 leads degradation.
thus, substitution icp0 aspartate 199 alanine attenuates degradation 
of cdc34 binding icp0 ring finger domain. (ii) substitution of
residue 620 reported abolish interaction ubiquitin-specific
protease effect function ubiquitin ligase. (iii) icp0 contains
an additional distinct e3 ligase activity specific ubch5a- ubch6
e2-conjugating enzymes mapping ring finger domain. is, our
knowledge, first identification viral protein least two
physically separated e3 ligase activities different e2 specificities. the
results suggest activity may target different proteins.
