in b lymphocytes, down-regulatory phosphatase shp-1 associates cd22 
cd32b (also known fcgammariib) acts critical negative regulator of
b-cell receptor signaling. bovine leukemia virus, retrovirus htlv/blv
group, causes persistently increased numbers peripheral blood b lymphocytes,
known persistent lymphocytosis (pl) and, animals, progression to
b-cell leukemia and/or lymphoma. here, show shp-1 associates the
bovine leukemia virus transmembrane protein, gp30. interaction either
direct indirect. interaction dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, and
the interaction increases cell stimulation sodium pervanadate. the
gp30-shp-1 interaction seen blv-infected, pl animals tested, but
is seen uninfected animals blv-infected, non-pl animals, 
do express significant quantities gp30. however, one blv-infected, non-pl 
animal expressed large quantities gp30, yet gp30-shp-1 interaction was
detected, suggesting may factors cells pl animals
that facilitate gp30-shp-1 interaction. association gp30 shp-1
suggests hypothesis gp30 may act decoy sequester shp-1,
resulting up-regulation b-cell receptor signaling. implication 
could novel mechanism viral activation lymphocytes removal a
down-regulatory phosphatase.
