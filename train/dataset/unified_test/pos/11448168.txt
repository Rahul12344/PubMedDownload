sh3 domains regulate many normal pathological cellular processes guiding
specific protein interactions. studies binding hiv-1 nef sh3 domain 
of hck tyrosine kinase indicated important role sh3 rt-loop
region ligand binding. tested potential artificial
hck-derived sh3 domains carrying tailored rt-loops providing high affinity for
nef intracellular inhibitors nef. artificial sh3 domains efficiently 
associated nef cells thereby potently inhibited sh3-dependent nef
functions, association p21-activated kinase-2 induction the
transcription factor nfat. hand, biochemical functional data
indicated nef-targeted sh3 domains prone compete normal
sh3-mediated processes. thus, rt-loop-modified sh3 domains represent novel
approach selectively interfering cellular signaling events, could 
be exploited research well therapeutic applications.
