sr proteins purified uninfected hela cells inhibit adenovirus iiia pre-mrna 
splicing binding intronic iiia repressor element (3re). contrast, sr
proteins purified late adenovirus-infected cells functionally
inactivated splicing repressor proteins virus-induced dephosphorylation. 
we shown adenovirus e4-orf4 protein, binds cellular
protein phos phatase 2a (pp2a) activates iiia splicing vitro vivo, 
induces sr protein dephosphorylation. show e4-orf4 interacts with
only subset sr proteins present hela cells. thus, e4-orf4 interacts
efficiently sf2/asf srp30c, sr proteins.
interestingly, e4-orf4 interacts sf2/asf latter's rna
recognition motifs. furthermore, e4-orf4 interacts preferentially the
hyperphosphorylated form sr proteins found uninfected hela cells. e4-orf4
mutant proteins fail bind strongly pp2a sf2/asf relieve 
repressive effect hela sr proteins iiia pre-mrna splicing transient
transfection experiments, suggesting interaction three
proteins required e4-orf4-induced sr protein dephosphorylation.
