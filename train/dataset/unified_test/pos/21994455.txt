the influenza virus transcribes replicates genome inside nucleus of
infected cells. activities performed viral rna-dependent rna
polymerase composed three subunits pa, pb1, pb2, recent
studies shown requires host cell factors transcribe replicate
the viral genome. identify cellular partners, generated a
comprehensive physical interaction map polymerase subunit the
host cellular proteome. total 109 human interactors identified yeast
two-hybrid screens, whereas 90 retrieved literature mining. built 
flupol interactome network composed influenza virus polymerase (pa, pb1,
and pb2) nucleoprotein np 234 human proteins connected
through 279 viral-cellular protein interactions. analysis interactome map
revealed enriched cellular functions associated influenza virus
polymerase, including host factors involved rna polymerase ii-dependent
transcription mrna processing. confirmed eight influenza virus
polymerase-interacting proteins required virus replication and
transcriptional activity viral polymerase. involved cellular 
transcription (c14orf166, cops5, mnat1, nmi, polr2a), translation (eif3s6ip),
nuclear transport (nup54), dna repair (fancg). conversely, identified
prkra, acts inhibitor viral polymerase transcriptional
activity thus required cellular antiviral response.
