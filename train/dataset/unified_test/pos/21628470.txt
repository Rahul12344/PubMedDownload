cell cycle dysregulation critical event virus infection-associated
tumorigenesis. previous studies suggested hepatitis c virus ns5b
modulates cell cycle progression addition participating rna synthesis as
an rna-dependent rna polymerase. however, molecular mechanisms thus far 
remained unclear. study, hepg2 tet-on ns5b stable cell line was
generated confirm effect ns5b cell cycle. better understand
the role ns5b cell cycle regulation, yeast two-hybrid assays performed
using human liver cdna library. cyclin-dependent kinase 2-interacting
protein (cinp) identified. interaction ns5b cinp 
demonstrated vivo vitro assays, association found to
be indispensable phase delay cell proliferation suppression. further
experiments indicated ns5b relocalized cinp nucleus the
cytoplasm. directly knocking cinp specific sirna resulted a
significant alteration dna damage response expression cell cycle
checkpoint proteins, including increase p21 decrease in
phosphorylated retinoblastoma chk1. similar results observed cells
expressing ns5b, effects partially reversed upon ectopic
overexpression cinp. studies suggest dna damage response might 
be exploited ns5b hinder cell cycle progression. taken together, data
demonstrate ns5b delays cells phase interaction cinp and
relocalization protein nucleus cytoplasm. effects
might contribute hepatitis c virus persistence pathogenesis.
