neurovirulence one pathological complications associated vaccinia 
virus (vv) infection/vaccination. although viral n1l protein been
identified neurovirulence factor, none host n1l-interacting factors
have identified far. present study, identified n1l-interacting 
proteins screening human brain cdna expression library n1l bait
protein yeast two-hybrid analysis. analysis revealed n1l interacts 
with human brain-originated cellular basement membrane-associated chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan (bamacan). n1l-binding domain bamacan mapped to
its c-terminal 227 amino acids. n1l-bamacan interaction confirmed
in vv-infected n1l-transfected mammalian cells. following the
confirmation protein interactions coimmunoprecipitation experiments,
confocal microscopic analysis revealed n1l colocalizes bamacan 
vv-infected b-sc-1 cells well mice neuronal tissue. furthermore, human
neural cell line, expresses bamacan moderately elevated levels relative 
to non-neural cell line, supported enhanced viral growth. overall, these
studies clearly suggest bamacan interacts vv-n1l such
interactions seem play positive role promoting viral growth and
perhaps contribute virulence vv neural cells.
