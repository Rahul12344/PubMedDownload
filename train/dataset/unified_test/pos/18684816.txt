the e5 proteins human papillomaviruses (hpvs) small hydrophobic proteins
that expressed early late stages viral life cycle; however,
their role hpv pathogenesis clearly understood. study, a
split-ubiquitin yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system used to
identify b-cell-associated protein 31 (bap31) binding partner hpv e5
proteins. association proteins confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation complexes bap31 either hpv type 16 (hpv16) or
hpv31 e5. addition, bap31 e5 found colocalize perinuclear
patterns consistent localization endoplasmic reticulum. mutational
analysis e5 identified amino acids extreme c terminus important 
stabilizing interaction bap31. deletion c-terminal amino acids 
of e5 context complete hpv31 genomes resulted impaired proliferative
capacity hpv-positive keratinocytes following differentiation. small
interfering rnas used reduce levels bap31, proliferative
ability hpv-positive keratinocytes upon differentiation also reduced,
implicating bap31 regulator process. studies identify novel 
binding partner high-risk hpv e5 proteins provide insight the
e5 proteins may modulate life cycle differentiating cells.
