measles virus aerosol-transmitted virus affects 10 million
children year accounts approximately 120,000 deaths. although was
long believed replicate respiratory epithelium disseminating, it
was recently shown infect initially macrophages dendritic cells the
airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (slamf1;
also called cd150) receptor. cells cross respiratory
epithelium transport infection lymphatic organs measles virus
replicates vigorously. virus crosses back airways

preferentially expressed virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, we
identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (pvrl4)) a
candidate host exit receptor. adherens junction protein the
immunoglobulin superfamily interacts viral attachment protein high

epithelial cells, including macaque tracheae. although viruses use

that measles virus targets nectin-4 emerge airways. nectin-4 a
