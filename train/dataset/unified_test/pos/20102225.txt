basic-region leucine-zipper transcription factors (bzips) contain segment rich 
in basic amino acids bind dna, followed leucine zipper can
interact leucine zippers form coiled-coil homo- heterodimers.
several viruses encode proteins containing bzip domains, including four that
encode bzips lacking significant homology human protein. investigated
the interaction specificity four viral bzips using coiled-coil arrays
to assess self-associations well heterointeractions 33 representative 
human bzips. arrays recapitulated reported viral-human interactions also 
uncovered new associations. meq hbz interacted multiple human partners
and unique interaction profiles compared human bzips, whereas k-bzip
and bzlf1 displayed homospecificity. new interactions detected included hbz 
mafb, mafg, atf2, cebpg, crebzf meq nfil3. confirmed in
solution using circular dichroism. hbz heteroassociate mafb mafg 
the presence mare-site dna, interaction dependent basic
region hbz. nfil3 meq different yet overlapping dna-binding
specificities form heterocomplex dna. computational design
considering affinity meq specificity respect undesired
bzip-type interactions used generate meq dimerization inhibitor. this
peptide, anti-meq, bound meq stably specifically, assayed using
coiled-coil arrays circular dichroism solution. anti-meq also inhibited
meq binding dna. studies guide investigation function
of viral human bzip complexes.
