apobec1 (a1) cytidine deaminase involved regulation lipids 
small intestine. herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) ubiquitous pathogen 
capable infecting neurons brain, causing encephalitis. here, show
that a1 induced encephalitis neurons rats infected hsv-1. in
cells stably expressing a1, hsv-1 infection resulted significantly reduced
virus replication compared control cells. infectivity could be
restored levels comparable observed control cells a1
expression silenced specific a1 short hairpin rnas (shrna). moreover,
cytidine deaminase activity appeared essential inhibition led 
to impaired accumulation viral mrna transcripts dna copy numbers. the
sequencing viral gene ul54 dna, extracted infected a1-expressing cells,
revealed g-to-a c-to-t transitions, indicating a1 associates hsv-1 
dna. taken together, results demonstrate model a1 induction during
encephalitis neurons may aid thwarting hsv-1 infection.
