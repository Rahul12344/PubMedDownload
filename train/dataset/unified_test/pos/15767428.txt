we investigated role human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) early 
untranslated region (3' utr) hpv-16 gene expression. found deletion of
the early 3' utr reduced utilization early polyadenylation signal and,
as consequence, resulted read-through late region production of
late l1 l2 mrnas. deletion u-rich 3' half early 3' utr a
similar effect, demonstrating 57-nucleotide u-rich region acted an
enhancing upstream element early polyadenylation signal. accordance
with this, newly identified hfip1 protein, shown enhance
polyadenylation u-rich upstream elements, interacted specifically with
the hpv-16 upstream element. upstream element also interacted specifically
with cstf-64, hnrnp c1/c2, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, suggesting
that factors either enhancing regulating polyadenylation the
hpv-16 early polyadenylation signal. mutational inactivation early
polyadenylation signal also resulted increased late mrna production. however, 
the effect reduced activation upstream cryptic polyadenylation
signals, demonstrating presence additional strong rna elements downstream 
of early polyadenylation signal direct cleavage polyadenylation to
this region hpv-16 genome. addition, identified 3' splice site 
genomic position 742 early region potential produce e1 e4 
mrnas e1 e4 open reading frames preceded the
suboptimal e6 aug. mrnas would therefore efficiently translated
into e1 e4 previously described hpv-16 e1 e4 mrnas e1 and
e4 preceded e6 e7 augs.
