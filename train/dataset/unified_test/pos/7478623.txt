the survival-promoting activity bcl-2 family proteins appears be
modulated interactions various cellular proteins. identified a
novel cellular protein, bik, interacts cellular survival-promoting 
proteins, bcl-2 bcl-xl, well viral survival-promoting proteins,
epstein barr virus-bhrf1 adenovirus e1b-19 kda. transient transfection
assays, bik promotes cell death manner similar death-promoting
members bcl-2 family, bax bak. death-promoting activity bik
can suppressed coexpression bcl-2, bcl-xl, ebv-bhrf1 e1b-19 kda
proteins suggesting bik may common target cellular viral
anti-apoptotic proteins. bik show overt homology bh1 and
bh2 conserved domains characteristic bcl-2 family, share 9 amino
acid domain (bh3) bax bak may critical determinant the
death-promoting activity proteins.
