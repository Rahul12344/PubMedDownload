the recognition pathogenic dna important initiation antiviral
responses. report identification ddx41, member dexdc
family helicases, intracellular dna sensor myeloid dendritic cells
(mdcs). knockdown ddx41 expression short hairpin rna blocked ability of
mdcs mount type interferon cytokine responses dna dna viruses.
overexpression ddx41 membrane-associated adaptor sting together
had synergistic effect promoting ifnb promoter activity. ddx41 bound both
dna sting localized together sting cytosol. knockdown of
ddx41 expression blocked activation mitogen-activated protein kinase tbk1 
and transcription factors nf-Îºb irf3 b-form dna. results suggest
that ddx41 additional dna sensor depends sting sense pathogenic 
dna.
