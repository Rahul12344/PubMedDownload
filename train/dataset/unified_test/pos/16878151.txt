the pdz proteins hdlg, hscrib magis function the
membrane-associated protein scaffolds shown interact the
high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) e6s. report, identify a
golgi-associated pdz protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-associated 
ligand (cal) cellular target hpv16 e6 proteomic approach. the
carboxy-terminal pdz-binding motif hpv16 e6 specifically interacts the
pdz domain cal, interaction enhances proteasome-mediated degradation
of cal. hpv16 e6 interacts cal strongly degrades better than
hpv18 e6 owing compatible pdz-binding motif. cal ubiquitinated 
the e6/e6-associated protein (e6ap) complex e6ap alone, albeit less
efficiently, indicates could normal target e6ap. although
it downregulates cal transcript level, small interfering rna-induced
depletion hpv16 e6 caski cells stabilizes cal protein level,
suggesting hpv16 e6 mediates proteasomal degradation cal in
hpv-positive cervical cancer cells. hpv16 e6 may tightly regulate vesicular
trafficking processes interacting cal, modification can
contribute development cervical cancer.
