kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus forms multimolecular complex of
integrins (alphavbeta5, alphavbeta3, alpha3beta1) cd98-xct during

kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) interacts cell surface
heparan sulfate (hs) alpha3beta1 integrin early stages of
infection human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hmvec-d) human
foreskin fibroblasts (hff), interactions followed virus entry
overlapping induction preexisting host cell signal pathways. kshv
also utilizes amino acid transporter protein xct infection adherent
cells, xct molecule part cell surface heterodimeric membrane
glycoprotein cd98 (4f2 antigen) complex known interact alpha3beta1 and
alphavbeta3 integrins. kshv gb mediates adhesion hmvec-d, cv-1, ht-1080
cells hff via rgd sequence. anti-alphav -beta1 integrin antibodies
inhibited cell adhesion mediated kshv-gb. variable levels of
neutralization hmvec-d hff infection observed antibodies against
alphavbeta3 alphavbeta5 integrins. similarly, variable levels inhibition
of virus entry adherent hmvec-d, 293 vero cells, hff observed by
preincubating virus soluble alpha3beta1, alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5
integrins, cumulative inhibition observed combination of
integrins. unable infect ht1080 cells. virus binding dna
internalization studies suggest alphavbeta3 alphavbeta5 integrins also
play roles kshv entry. observed time-dependent temporal kshv interactions
with hmvec-d integrins cd98/xct three different patterns association 
and dissociation. integrin alphavbeta5 interaction cd98/xct predominantly
occurred 1 min postinfection (p.i.) dissociated 10 min p.i., whereas
alpha3beta1-cd98/xct interaction maximal 10 min p.i. dissociated 30
min p.i., alphavbeta3-cd98/xct interaction maximal 10 min p.i. and
remained observed 30 min p.i. fluorescence microscopy also showed a
similar time-dependent interaction alphavbeta5-cd98. confocal-microscopy
studies confirmed association cd98/xct alpha3beta1 kshv.
preincubation kshv soluble heparin alpha3beta1 significantly
inhibited association, suggesting first contact hs and
integrin essential element subsequent cd98-xct interactions. anti-cd98
and xct antibodies block virus binding entry nuclear delivery 
viral dna; however, viral-gene expression significantly inhibited, suggesting
that cd98-xct play roles post-entry stage infection, possibly in
mediating signal cascades essential viral-gene expression. together, these
studies suggest kshv interacts functionally related integrins
(alphavbeta3, alpha3beta1, alphavbeta5) cd98/xct molecules temporal 
fashion form multimolecular complex early stages endothelial
cell infection, probably mediating multiple roles entry, signal transduction, 
and viral-gene expression.
