the kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) replication transcription 
activator (rta) protein regulates latent-lytic switch transactivating a
variety kshv lytic cellular promoters. rta novel e3 ubiquitin ligase 
that targets number transcriptional repressor proteins degradation by
the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. herein, show rta interacts the
cellular transcriptional repressor protein hey1. demonstrate hey1 a
target rta-mediated ubiquitination subsequently degraded the
proteasome. moreover, cys-plus-his-rich region within rta important for
rta-mediated degradation hey1. confirm hey1 represses rta promoter
and, furthermore, show hey1 binds rta promoter. interaction was
observed hey1 corepressor msin3a, interaction was
abolished presence rta. additionally, msin3a associated rta
promoter nonreactivated, reactivated, bcbl1 cells. small interfering
rna knockdown hey1 hek 293t cells latently infected recombinant
virus rkshv.219 led increased levels rta expression upon reactivation but
was insufficient induce complete lytic reactivation. results suggest
that additional transcriptional repressors also important in
maintenance kshv latency. taken together, results suggest hey1 
contributory role maintenance kshv latency disruption the
hey1 repressosome rta-targeted degradation may one step mechanism to
regulate lytic reactivation.
