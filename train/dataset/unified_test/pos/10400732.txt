the serp2 protein encoded leporipoxvirus myxoma virus essential for
full virulence (f. messud-petit, j. gelfi, m. delverdier, m. f. amardeilh, r. py,
g. sutter, s. bertagnoli, j. virol. 72:7830-7839, 1998) and, like crma of
cowpox virus (cpv), reported inhibit interleukin-1beta-converting
enzyme (ice, caspase-1) (f. petit, s. bertagnoli, j. gelfi, f. fassy, c.
boucraut-baralon, a. milon, j. virol. 70:5860-5866, 1996). serp2 crma
both contain asp p1 position within serpin reactive site loop yet 
are 35% identical overall. serp2 protein cleaved ice but, unlike
crma, form stable complex ice detectable native gel
electrophoresis. attempts covalently cross-link ice-serpin inhibitory
complexes successful crma, complex ice serp2 was
visible cross-linking. purified his10-tagged serp2 protein relatively
poor inhibitor ice, ki 80 nm compared 4 pm crma. serp2
protein resembled crma stable complex serine proteinase
granzyme b detectable sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. however, serp2 less effective inhibiting granzyme b
activity (ki = 420 nm) crma (ki = 100 nm). finally, serp2 tested the
ability replace crma inhibit apoptosis llc-pk1 cells infected a
cpv recombinant deleted crma expressing serp2. unlike
wild-type-cpv-infected cells, apoptosis readily observed cells infected
with recombinant virus, indicated induction nuclear
fragmentation caspase-mediated cleavage devd-amc
[acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-(amino-4-methyl coumarin)]. results indicate that
serp2 unable functionally substitute crma within context cpv and
that inhibition spectra serp2 crma distinct.
