previous work indicated pdz domain tax interacting protein 1 (tip-1)
is target htlv1 tax protein potential rhoa effector. have
used yeast two-hybrid system show tip-1 also interacts hpv16
e6 protein. interaction confirmed co-immunoprecipitation e6
expressing c33a cervical carcinoma cells (c33a-e6) showed tip-1 was
not degraded interaction hpv16 e6 oncoprotein. routine passage
we observed c33a-e6 less compact morphology less adherent
than control vector transfected cells c33a-v cells - known effect gtp-rhoa. 
comparison c33a-e6 c33a-v demonstrated e6 expressing cells higher 
levels phosphorylated myosin light chains (mlc) increased cell motility,
which inhibited antisense silencing tip-1 expression rhoa
kinase (rock) inhibitor y27632. c33a-e6 c33a-v cells shown to
express gtp activated rhoa. since rocks activated gtp rhoa data
indicate e6 may increase cell motility augmenting gtp rhoa mediated
activation rocks dependent expression tip-1
protein.
