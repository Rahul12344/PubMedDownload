surface glycoproteins principal receptors used pathogens invade target 
cells. suggested mammalian erythrocyte surface glycoproteins
function decoy receptors attracting pathogens anucleated erythrocyte
and away target tissues. glycophorin (gypa) solely expressed on
the erythrocyte surface abundant sialoglycoprotein, although
its function unknown. pathogen decoy hypothesis may relevant here, as
gypa shown vitro bind numerous viruses bacteria, 
infect erythrocytes. however, also receptor erythrocyte invasion by
the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum. analyses gypa sequence variation 
among six higher primates within human population show a
large excess replacement (nonsynonymous) substitutions along primate
lineage (particularly exons 2-4 encoding extracellular glycosylated domain
of gypa) significant excess polymorphisms exon 2 (encoding the
terminal portion extracellular domain) within humans. two signatures
suggest exceptionally strong positive selection this
receptor driving gypa divergence primate evolution balancing selection
maintaining allelic variation within human populations. pathogen decoy
hypothesis alone adequate explain signatures between-species 
and within-species diversifying selection. implications for
understanding functions erythrocyte surface components roles
