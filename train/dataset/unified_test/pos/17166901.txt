like coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars
cov) assembles buds lumen endoplasmic reticulum (er)-golgi
intermediate compartment (ergic). accumulation viral envelope proteins 
this compartment prerequisite virus assembly. previously, reported
the identification dibasic motif (kxhxx) cytoplasmic tail sars
cov spike (s) protein similar canonical dilysine er retrieval
signal. demonstrate motif novel functional er
retrieval signal reduced rate traffic full-length protein
through golgi complex. kxhxx motif also partially retained two different 
reporter proteins ergic region reduced rates trafficking,
although motif less potent canonical dilysine signal. the
dibasic motif bound coatomer complex (copi) vitro binding assay,
suggesting er retrieval may contribute accumulation sars cov s
protein near virus assembly site interaction viral structural 
proteins. support this, found dibasic motif sars s
protein required localization ergic/golgi region when
coexpressed sars membrane (m) protein. thus, cycling sars through
the er-golgi system may required incorporation assembling virions
in ergic.
