the e7 oncoprotein human papillomavirus type 16 promotes cell proliferation in
the presence antiproliferative signals. mutagenesis e7 revealed that
this activity requires three regions, conserved regions 1 2 c-terminal 
zinc finger. binding retinoblastoma tumor repressor (rb) lxcxe 
motif conserved region 2 necessary, sufficient, e7 induce
proliferation. tested hypothesis binding rb sufficient
because conserved region 1 and/or c terminus required e7 to
functionally inactivate rb thus induce proliferation. one mechanism proposed 
for e7 inactivates rb blocking rb-e2f binding. either conserved region 
1 c terminus necessary, combination lxcxe motif, e7 to
block rb-e2f binding vitro. full-length e7 proteins mutations
outside lxcxe motif inhibited rb-e2f binding, failed abrogate cell
cycle arrest, demonstrating blocking rb-e2f binding sufficient for
abrogating antiproliferative signals. another mechanism proposed e7
inactivates rb promoting destabilization rb protein. mutations in
conserved region 1 lxcxe motif prevented e7 reducing half-life of
rb. though specific c-terminal residues e7 essential destabilizing
rb, novel class mutations uncouple destabilization rb the
deregulation keratinocyte proliferation discovered. destabilization rb 
correlated abrogation rb-induced quiescence sufficient
for overriding dna damage-induced cell cycle arrest increasing
keratinocyte life span. finally, regions e7 required for
destabilizing rb required reducing p107 p130 levels. together, these
results suggest inactivation three rb family members not
sufficient deregulate keratinocyte cell cycle control.
