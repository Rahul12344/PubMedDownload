we established hepatitis c virus (hcv) core-expressing cells investigated
whether hcv core would modify janus kinase (jak)-signal transducer and
activator transcription factor (stat) pathway interleukin-6 (il-6) and
interferon (ifn)-gamma stimuli. phosphorylation jak1/2 stat3, and
stat3-mediated transcription, prevented hcv core il-6 stimulation. 
in contrast, hcv core increased phosphorylation jak1/2 stat1 and
stat1-mediated transcription ifn-gamma stimulation.
immunoprecipitation/western blot analysis showed hcv core could bind to
jak1/2. pgypwp sequences codons 79-84 within hcv core important for
interaction jaks vitro binding analysis. reporter gene assay,
hcv core-mediated suppression jak-stat pathway il-6 stimulation 
observed abrogation pgypwp sequence, suggesting hcv core/jak
interaction may directly affect signal transduction. contrast,
augmentation jak-stat pathway still seen hcv core without functional
pgypwp sequence ifn-gamma stimulation. flow cytometric analysis revealed
that hcv core up-regulated ifn-gamma receptor 2 expression, may be
responsible hcv core-mediated enhancement jak-stat pathway ifn-gamma
stimulation. conclusion, hcv core different effects jak-stat
pathway il-6 ifn-gamma stimuli. may exerted two
independent mechanisms.
