in cells infected kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), the
activation mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathways plays crucial
role early virus infection well reactivation. order to
systematically identify viral proteins activating mapk pathways kshv-infected 
cells, clone collection kshv open reading frames (orfs) screened for
induction serum response element (sre), sre induced mapks. the
strongest induction sre found orf73 (latency-associated nuclear
antigen 1, lana-1), although weaker activation also found kaposin
b isoform, orf54 (dutpase) orf74 (g-protein-coupled receptor). bipartite 
sre bound ternary complex consisting serum response factor (srf) and
ternary complex factor. lana-1 bound directly srf, also med25
(arc92/acid-1), med15 (pcqap) med23 (sur-2) subunits mediator complex,
a multi-subunit transcriptional co-activator complex rna polymerase ii.
lana-1-induced sre activation inhibited dominant-negative n-terminal
domain med25 mediator subunit, suggesting subunit mediates
lana-1-induced sre activation. summary, data suggest model which
lana-1 acts adaptor transcription factor srf basal
transcriptional machinery.
