membrane envelopment budding negative strand rna viruses (nsvs) mainly 
driven viral matrix proteins (m). addition, several proteins also
known involved host cell manipulation. knowledge cellular
targets detailed molecular mechanisms, however, poor many proteins. 
for instance, nipah virus (niv) protein trafficking nucleus is
essential virus release, nuclear targets niv remain unknown. to
identify cellular interactors henipavirus proteins, tagged hendra virus
(hev) proteins expressed m-containing protein complexes isolated 
and analysed. presence acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family
member b (anp32b) complex suggested protein represents direct 
or indirect interactor viral matrix protein. over-expression anp32b led
to specific nuclear accumulation hev m, providing functional link between
anp32b protein. anp32b-dependent nuclear accumulation observed after
plasmid-driven expression hev niv matrix proteins also niv infected
cells. latter indicated interaction henipavirus protein with
anp32b also occurs context virus replication. data we
conclude anp32b nuclear target henipavirus may contribute 
virus replication. potential effects anp32b hev nuclear shuttling host 
cell manipulation hev affecting anp32b functions host cell survival and
gene expression regulation discussed.
