both ns3 protein (1007-1657) protease moiety (ns3p, 1027-1207) able 
to interact vitro c1 inhibitor (c1inh) give 95-kda mr c1inh cleavage
product similar obtained upon proteolysis complement protease c1s.
high-mr reaction products also detected incubation c1inh ns3
but ns3p; correspond ester-bonded complexes their
hydroxylamine lability. similar reactivity ns3 observed upon incubation
with alpha2-antiplasmin. serpin cleavage prevented treatment ns3 with
synthetic serine protease inhibitors. interaction viral ns3 host
serpins suggests ns3 likely controlled infected cell protease
inhibitors.
