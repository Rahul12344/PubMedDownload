mammalian genomes encode two related serine-threonine kinases, nuclear dbf2
related (ndr)1 ndr2, homologous saccharomyces cerevisiae
dbf2 kinase. recently, yeast genetic screen implicated dbf2 kinase ty1
retrotransposition. since several virion-incorporated kinases regulate the
infectivity human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), speculated that
the human ndr1 ndr2 kinases might play role hiv-1 life cycle. here
we show ndr1 ndr2 kinases incorporated hiv-1 particles.
furthermore, ndr1 ndr2 cleaved hiv-1 protease (pr), within
virions within producer cells. truncation pr cleavage site altered
ndr2 subcellular localization inhibited ndr1 ndr2 enzymatic activity.
these studies identify two new virion-associated host cell enzymes suggest 
novel mechanism hiv-1 alters intracellular environment human
cells.
