a cellular transcriptional factor initially identified c-myc promoter
binding protein (mbp-1) subsequently characterized cell regulatory
protein multifunctional activities. study, role mbp-1 on
human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) transcriptional activity was
investigated. mbp-1 showed inhibition hiv-1 long terminal repeat
(ltr)-directed chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) activity transient
cotransfection assay. deletion upstream elements hiv-1 ltr, including
the nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappa b) sp1 binding sites, affect the
mbp-1 mediated suppression hiv-1 ltr. core promoter hiv-1 appeared 
to primary sequence involved mbp-1 mediated inhibition. presence
of hiv-1 tar sequence tat protein, mbp-1 inhibit viral promoter
activity. addition, cotransfection experiments hiv-1 ltr deletion
mutants mbp-1 suggested carboxyl terminal half mbp-1 suppresses
the hiv-1 promoter activity. exogenous expression mbp-1 showed suppression 
hiv-1 replication acutely infected cells cells cotransfected a
molecular clone hiv-1. results suggest exogenous expression of
mbp-1 plays important role regulation hiv-1 replication infected 
cells.
