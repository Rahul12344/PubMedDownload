the inflammatory response mediated immune system major cause of
hepatitis b virus (hbv)-associated liver injury. here, identified cd59, a
novel hbc-interacting protein hepatocytes tandem affinity purification
(tap) screening. expression cd59 markedly down-regulated in
hbc-transfected hepg2 hepg2.215 cells, resulted upshift of
hepatocyte sensitivity membrane attack complex (mac)-induced cell lysis. these
results consistent accumulation macs liver of
hbv-infected patients. additional analyses using laser confocal microscopy,
quantitative pcr flow cytometry revealed cd59 specifically
translocated nucleus upon binding hbc, induced the
down-regulation cd59 mrna protein levels.
