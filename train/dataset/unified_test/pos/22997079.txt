chikungunya virus (chikv) recently re-emerged causing millions infections 
in countries around indian ocean. chikv broad host cell range and
productively infects number different cell types, macrophages been
identified potential viral reservoir serving increase duration of
symptoms. date chikv interacting protein characterized this
study sought identify chikv binding proteins expressed target cell
membranes. two-dimensional virus overlay identified prohibitin (phb) a
microglial cell expressed chikv binding protein. co-localization,
co-immunoprecipitation well antibody sirna mediated infection
inhibition studies confirmed role phb mediating internalization of
chikv microglial cells. phb first identified chikv receptor protein, 
and study evidence phb may play role internalization of
multiple viruses.
