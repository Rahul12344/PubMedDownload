human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), contrast animal retroviruses
such murine leukemia virus, lysed human complement. nevertheless,
hiv-1 activates complement via classical pathway independent antibody, and
c3b deposition facilitates infection complement receptor-bearing cells. using 
gel exclusion chromatography sephacryl s-1000, purified virions found 
bind 125i-labeled c1q, 125i-labeled dimeric proenzyme c1s. virions
activated c1 complex, reconstituted c1q, proenzyme c1r, 125i-labeled
proenzyme c1s, extent comparable obtained immunoglobulin
g-ovalbumin immune complexes. determine activating viral component,
recombinant viral proteins used: solid phase, soluble gp41 (sgp41)
(the outer membrane part gp41, residues 539-684 gp160) bound c1q, not
dimeric proenzyme c1s, gp120 ineffective. fluid phase, sgp41
activated c1 complex dose- time-dependent manner, efficiently
than aggregated ig, less efficiently immune complexes. localize the
c1 activating site(s) gp41, synthetic peptides (15-residue oligomers spanning 
amino acids 531-695 gp160) used. peptides covering positions 591-605 
601-620 and, lesser extent, positions 561-575, ability bind 
c1q induce c3 deposition. data provide first experimental
evidence direct interaction c1 complex hiv-1, indicate
that c1 binding activation mediated specific sites gp41.
