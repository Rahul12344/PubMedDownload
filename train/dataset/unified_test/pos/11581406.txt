the hepatitis b virus (hbv) x protein (hbx) critical life cycle the
virus. hbx associates several host cell proteins including ddb1 subunit 
of damaged-dna binding protein ddb. recent studies x protein encoded
by woodchuck hepadnavirus provided correlative evidence indicating 
the interaction ddb1 important establishment infection the
virus. addition, interaction ddb1 implicated nuclear 
localization hbx. ddb2 subunit ddb required nuclear 
accumulation ddb1, investigated role ddb2 nuclear
accumulation hbx. show expression ddb2 increases nuclear
levels hbx. several c-terminal deletion mutants ddb2 fail bind ddb1
are able associate hbx, suggesting ddb2 may associate hbx
independently binding ddb1. also show ddb2 enhances nuclear
accumulation hbx independently binding ddb1, since mutant does
not bind ddb1 able enhance nuclear accumulation hbx. hbv infection
is associated liver pathogenesis. show nuclear levels ddb1
and ddb2 tightly regulated hepatocytes. studies regenerating mouse
liver indicate late g1 phase nuclear levels subunits of
ddb transiently increased, followed sharp decrease phase. taken
together, results suggest ddb1 ddb2 would participate the
nuclear functions hbx effectively late-g1 phase cell
cycle.
