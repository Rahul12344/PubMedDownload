all human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) early mrnas polyadenylated the
poly(a) signal within early 3' untranslated region (3'utr). 3'end 
early e5 open reading frame 3'utr hpv-16 au-rich, five
regions similar cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (cpes). show that
a fragment early 3'end comprising four five cpe-like regions when
inserted downstream reporter gene confers regulation gene expression.
a key protein involved cytoplasmic polyadenylation cpeb. show the
human cpeb1 repress activity reporter construct containing the
hpv-16 early sequences. repression counteracted human
cytoplasmic poly(a) polymerase, hgld-2 fused cpeb1. hgld-2/cpeb1 fusion
protein facilitates furthermore poly(a) elongation early hpv transcripts.
