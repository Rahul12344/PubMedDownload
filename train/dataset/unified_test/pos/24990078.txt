many members dexd/h box helicase family play important roles innate
immune system viral infection. therefore, isolated dsrna complex in
myeloid dendritic cells. found dhx15, dexdc helicase family member, 
one components complex. knockdown dhx15 expression short
hairpin rna efficiently reduced ability myeloid dendritic cells produce
ifn-β, il-6, tnf-α response dsrna rna virus. dhx15 specifically
bound polyinosine-polycytidylic acid via helicase c-terminal domain. dhx15
interacted mavs formed complex following stimulation with
polyinosine-polycytidylic acid. n-terminal domain containing dexdc motif in
dhx15 bound c terminus mavs. dhx15 required activate irf3
phosphorylation well nf-κb mapk signaling rna virus infection.
we, therefore, identified dhx15 new rna virus sensor mediated mavs to
activate immune responses rna.
