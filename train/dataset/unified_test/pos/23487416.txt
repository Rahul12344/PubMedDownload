the severe manifestations malaria (caused plasmodium falciparum) occur
as direct result parasitemia following invasion erythrocytes by
post-liver blood-stage merozoites, subsequent cyto-adherence of
infected erythrocytes vascular endothelium. however, disproportionate 
epidemiologic clustering severe malaria aggressive forms endemic
diseases kaposi's sarcoma (ks), neoplasm etiologically linked
to infection ks-associated herpesvirus (kshv), underscores significance 
of previously unexplored co-pathogenetic interactions potential 
modify overall disease burden co-infected individuals. based recent
studies mechanisms p. falciparum kshv evolved interact
with mutual human host, several new perspectives emerging that
highlight surprising convergence biological themes potentially underlying
their associated co-morbidities. background, ongoing studies are
rapidly constructing fascinating new paradigm major host receptors
that control parasite invasion (basigin/cd147) cyto-adherence (cd36) are,
surprisingly, also important targets exploitation kshv. article,
we consider major pathobiological implications co-option of
basigin/cd147 cd36 signaling pathways p. falciparum kshv, not
only essential host factors parasite persistence also important
mediators pro-angiogenic phenotype within virus-infected endothelial
microenvironment. consequently, triangulation interactions p.
falciparum, kshv, mutual human host articulates syndemic relationship
that points conceptual framework prevalence aggressive forms ks in
malaria-endemic areas, implications possibility dual-use
