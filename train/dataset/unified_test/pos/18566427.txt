the identification surfactant protein (sp-a) important innate immune
factor lungs, amniotic fluid, vaginal tract suggests could
play important role various stages hiv disease progression and
transmission. therefore, examined whether sp-a could bind hiv also 
any effect viral infectivity. data demonstrate sp-a binds hiv a
calcium-dependent manner inhibitable mannose edta. affinity
capture hiv viral lysate reveals sp-a targets envelope
glycoprotein hiv (gp120), confirmed elisa using recombinant
gp120. digestion gp120 endoglycosidase h abrogates binding sp-a,
indicating high mannose structures gp120 target the
collectin. infectivity studies reveal sp-a inhibits infection cd4+ 
cells two strains hiv (bal, iiib) >80%. competition assays cd4 
mabs f105 b12 suggest sp-a inhibits infectivity occlusion the
cd4-binding site. studies dendritic cells (dcs) demonstrate sp-a
enhances binding gp120 dcs, uptake viral particles, the
transfer virus dcs cd4+ cells >5-fold ph representative of
the vaginal tract. collectively, results suggest sp-a acts dual
modulator hiv infection protecting cd4+ cells direct infection but
enhancing transfer infection cd4+ cells mediated dcs.
