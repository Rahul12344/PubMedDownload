the influenza virus m2 ion channel protein longest cytoplasmic tail
(ct) among three viral envelope proteins well conserved between
different viral strains. accessible host cellular machinery after
fusion endosomal membrane trafficking, assembly, and
budding processes. hypothesized identification host cellular
interactants m2 ct could help us better understand molecular mechanisms
regulating m2-dependent stages virus life cycle. using yeast
two-hybrid screening m2 ct bait, novel interaction human
annexin a6 (anxa6) protein identified, physical interaction was
confirmed coimmunoprecipitation assay colocalization study of
virus-infected human cells. found small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated 
knockdown anxa6 expression significantly increased virus production, its
overexpression could reduce titer virus progeny, suggesting negative
regulatory role anxa6 influenza virus infection. further
characterization revealed anxa6 depletion overexpression effect on
the early stages virus life cycle viral rna replication impaired
the release progeny virus, suggested delayed defective budding events
observed plasma membrane virus-infected cells transmission electron 
microscopy. collectively, work identifies anxa6 novel cellular
regulator targets impairs virus budding release stages the
influenza virus life cycle.
