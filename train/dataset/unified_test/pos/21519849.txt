vpr, accessory gene human immunodeficiency virus type 1, encodes a
virion-associated nuclear protein plays important role primary
viral infection resting macrophages. variety biological functions,
including roles cell cycle abnormality g(2)/m phase, apoptosis, nuclear
transfer preintegration complex, dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), 
which depend association chromatin host cells. given 
dsb signals postulated positive factor viral infection,
understanding mode chromatin recruitment vpr important. here, we
identified snf2h, chromatin-remodeling factor, novel binding partner of
vpr involved chromatin recruitment. endogenous snf2h protein was
extensively downregulated snf2h small interfering rna (sirna), amount of
vpr loaded chromatin decreased 30% control level. biochemical 
analysis using mutant vpr suggested vpr binds snf2h via hfrig (amino acids
71-75 depicted single letters) vpr mutant lacking motif lost 
activity induce dsb-dependent signals. consistently, vpr-induced dsbs were
attenuated extensive downregulaion endogenous snf2h. based data,
we discuss role dsb dsb signals viral infection.
