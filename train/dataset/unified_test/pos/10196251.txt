it reported human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) bound to
follicular dendritic cells (fdcs) remains highly infectious cd4(+) cells
even forms immune complexes neutralizing antibody (hiv-1/ic). to
elucidate role fdcs hiv-1 transmission cd4(+) cells lymph
nodes, isolated purified fdcs human tonsils examined whether
the hiv-1/ic trapped surface infectious cd4(+) cells. our
surprise, hiv-1/ic antibody-free hiv-1 fdcs could be
transmitted cd4(+) cells. furthermore, contrast previous studies
showing fdcs productively infected hiv-1, present study clearly
demonstrated fdcs target cells hiv-1 infection. fdcs could 
capture viral particles surface; however, binding hiv-1 to
fdcs strongly inhibited presence anti-cd54 (icam-1) monoclonal
antibody (mab) anti-cd11a (lfa-1) mab, suggesting adhesion molecules
play important role interaction hiv-1 fdcs.
