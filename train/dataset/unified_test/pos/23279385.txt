the extracellular matrix (ecm) receptor dystroglycan (dg) serves cellular
receptor highly pathogenic arenavirus lassa virus (lasv) causes a
haemorrhagic fever high mortality human. host cell, dg provides 
molecular link ecm actin cytoskeleton via adapter
proteins utrophin dystrophin. investigated post-translational
modifications dg context lasv cell entry. using tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor genistein, found tyrosine kinases required efficient
internalization virus particles, virus-receptor binding. engagement of
cellular dg lasv envelope glycoprotein (lasv gp) human epithelial cells
induced tyrosine phosphorylation cytoplasmic domain dg. lasv gp binding
to dg resulted dissociation adapter protein utrophin from
virus-bound dg. virus-induced dissociation utrophin affected by
genistein treatment, suggesting role receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in
the process.
