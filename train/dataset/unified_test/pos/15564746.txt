the bovine human papillomavirus (bpv/hpv) e2 proteins bind specifically to
palindromic sequences accgn4cggt concentrated within viral long
control region, regulate viral oncogene transcription. e2 activate
viral promoters relatively large distances within viral genome was
shown cooperate number cellular transcription factors.
transcriptional activator proteins, e2, thought act, least in
part, influencing assembly and/or stability preinitiation complexes and
it suggested transcription factor iid, composed the
tata-binding protein (tbp) numerous tbp-associated factors (tafs), a
possible target important viral protein. paper, demonstrate
that e2 proteins associate vitro several tafs, particular with
tafii250 tafii80. addition, observed association tafii250
with bpv1 e2 stronger hpv18 e2 carboxy terminal domain 
of viral proteins involved interaction. hand,
tafii80 binds similar strength e2 proteins amino
terminal region. observations may help explain different behavior of
bovine human e2 proteins, since bpv e2 stronger transcriptional
activator hpv18 e2.
