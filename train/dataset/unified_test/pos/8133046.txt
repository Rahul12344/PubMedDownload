exposure human neutrophils (pmn) influenza virus (iav) triggers discrete 
responses cells interfere normal host defense functions.
because restricted host range tissue specificities many viruses are
determined cell surface molecules acting virus receptors target cells,
it seemed plausible iav might interact neutrophils via specific plasma 
membrane glycoproteins bind viral hemagglutinin. binding of
intact iav (atcc strain a/pr/8/34 (h1n1)) pmns examined flow cytometry,
virus binding found saturable diminished extensive
desialation cells neuraminidase. stimulation pmns fmlp (0.1
microm) caused transient increase iav binding maximal (> 200%) 2
min stimulation. neutrophil membrane proteins separated gel
electrophoresis transferred nitrocellulose, iav bound selectively two
polypeptide bands approximately 125 160 kda. relative binding two
bands modified ultimately eliminated treatment pmn membrane
proteins neuraminidase electrophoresis blotting. intact virus
precipitated limited number proteins solubilized pmn plasma membrane
preparations, abs specific sialophorin (cd43) recognized
virus-precipitated pmn membrane proteins apparent m.w. those
detected virus-membrane protein blots. findings indicate iav binds 
to human pmns interactions limited number pmn membrane
glycoproteins, include sialophorin (cd43).
