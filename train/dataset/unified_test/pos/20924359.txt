influenza virus rna replication requires intricate regulatory network
involving viral cellular proteins. study, examined roles of
cellular ubiquitinating/deubiquitinating enzymes (dubs). observed that
downregulation cellular deubiquitinating enzyme usp11 resulted enhanced
virus production, suggesting usp11 could inhibit influenza virus
replication. conversely, overexpression usp11 specifically inhibited viral
genomic rna replication, inhibition required deubiquitinase
activity. furthermore, showed usp11 interacted pb2, pa, np of
viral rna replication complex, np monoubiquitinated protein can
be deubiquitinated usp11 vivo. finally, identified k184 the
ubiquitination site np residue crucial virus rna replication. 
we propose ubiquitination/deubiquitination np manipulated for
antiviral therapeutic purposes.
