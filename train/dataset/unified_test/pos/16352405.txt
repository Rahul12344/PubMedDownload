the immediate-early (ie) protein bicp22 bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv-1) acts as
transrepressor protein viral promoters different kinetic classes. the
present work, looked host cell targets bicp22 using yeast two-hybrid 
system identified seven candidates: (1) jik, serine/threonine kinase the
sterile 20 protein (ste20) family inhibits stress-related pathways; (2) camp
response element binding protein-like 2 (crebl2), bzip domain shares
homology creb, modulating transcription camp responsive genes; (3)
dna-dependent atpase helicase (atrx), protein snf2 family altering
nucleosome structure; (4) scaffold attachment factor b (saf-b), helps to
organize chromatin topologically separated loops; (5) peptidylglycine
alpha-amidating monooxygenase cooh-terminal interactor protein 1 (pamcip1),
involved regulation secretory pathway perinuclear area; (6) zinc
finger protein (znf38) found proliferating cells possibly associated 
meiosis male female gametogenesis; (7) flj22709, hypothetical protein
conserved among various species, containing occludin/ell domain. confirm
some interactions confocal fluorescence microscopy, bicp22 tagged
with red fluorescent protein amplicon, selected target sequences were
tagged green fluorescent protein plasmid expression vectors. upon
amplicon transduction vero cells plasmid transfection, crebl2 znf38
both colocalized bicp22 distinct nuclear domains.
