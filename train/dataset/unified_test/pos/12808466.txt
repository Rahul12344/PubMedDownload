viral replication usually requires innate intracellular lines defence 
overcome, task usually accomplished specialized viral gene products. the
virion infectivity factor (vif) protein human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
required late stages viral production counter antiviral
activity apobec3g (apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme, catalytic
polypeptide-like 3g; also known cem15), protein expressed notably human t
lymphocytes. produced presence apobec3g, vif-defective virus is
non-infectious. apobec3g closely related apobec1, central component 
an rna-editing complex deaminates cytosine residue apob messenger rna. 
apobec family members also potent dna mutator activity dc
deamination; however, whether editing potential apobec3g relevance
to hiv inhibition unknown. here, demonstrate does, apobec3g
exerts antiviral effect reverse transcription trigger g-to-a
hypermutation nascent retroviral dna. also find apobec3g act
on broad range retroviruses addition hiv, suggesting that
hypermutation editing general innate defence mechanism this
important group pathogens.
