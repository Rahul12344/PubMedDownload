vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) suppresses antiviral responses infected cells
by inhibiting host gene expression multiple levels, including transcription,
nuclear cytoplasmic transport, translation. inhibition host gene
expression due activity viral matrix (m) protein. previous
studies shown protein interacts host proteins rae1 nup98
that implicated regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. however,
rae1 function essential host mrna transport, raising question of
how interaction viral protein host protein essential 
gene expression causes global inhibition multiple levels. tested the
hypothesis may multiple protein-rae1 complexes involved in
inhibiting host gene expression multiple levels. using size exclusion
chromatography sedimentation velocity analysis, determined rae1
exists high, intermediate, low molecular weight complexes. the
intermediate molecular weight complexes containing nup98 interacted most
efficiently protein. low molecular weight form also interacted 
protein cells overexpress rae1 cells nup98 expression was
silenced. silencing rae1 expression little effect nuclear
accumulation host mrna vsv-infected cells, affect vsv's ability 
to inhibit host translation. instead, silencing rae1 expression reduced the
ability vsv inhibit host transcription. protein interacted efficiently
with rae1-nup98 complexes associated chromatin fraction host nuclei, 
consistent effect host transcription. results support idea
that protein-rae1 complexes serve platforms promote interaction 
protein factors involved host transcription. also support 
idea rae1-nup98 complexes play previously under-appreciated role in
regulation transcription.
