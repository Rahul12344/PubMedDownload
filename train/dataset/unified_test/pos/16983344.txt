small dna tumour viruses evolved number mechanisms drive nondividing
cells phase. virally encoded oncoproteins adenovirus e1a human
papillomavirus (hpv) e7 bind array cellular proteins override
proliferation arrest. dna methyltransferase dnmt1 major mammalian
enzyme responsible maintaining cpg methylation patterns cell following
replication. one hallmarks tumour cells disrupted dna methylation
patterns, highlighting importance proper regulation dna
methyltransferases normal cell proliferation. here, show adenovirus 5 
e1a hpv-16 e7 associate vitro vivo dna methyltransferase
dnmt1. consistent interaction, find e1a e7 purify dna
methyltransferase activity nuclear extracts. associations direct
and mediated extreme n-terminus e1a cr3 zinc-finger domain of
e7. furthermore, find point mutant leucine 20 e1a, residue
known critical transformation functions, unable bind dnmt1
and dna methyltransferase activity. finally, e1a e7 stimulate the
methyltransferase activity dnmt1 vitro. results provide first
indication viral oncoproteins bind regulate dnmt1 enzymatic activity.
these observations open possibility association may used to
control cellular proliferation pathways suggest new mechanism which
small dna tumour viruses steer cells cell cycle.
