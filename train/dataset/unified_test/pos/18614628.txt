pathogenic hantaviruses replicate within human endothelial cells cause two
diseases, hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. order replicate endothelial cells pathogenic hantaviruses
inhibit early induction beta interferon (ifn-beta). expression the
cytoplasmic tail pathogenic ny-1 hantavirus gn protein sufficient to
inhibit rig-i- tbk1-directed ifn responses. formation tbk1-traf3
complexes directs irf-3 phosphorylation, irf-3 nf-kappab activation 
are required transcription ifn-beta promoter. report that
the ny-1 virus (ny-1v) gn tail inhibits tbk1-directed nf-kappab activation
and tbk1-directed transcription promoters containing ifn-stimulated response
elements. ny-1v gn tail coprecipitated traf3 cellular lysates, and
analysis traf3 deletion mutants demonstrated traf3 n terminus is
sufficient interacting ny-1v gn tail. contrast, gn tail of
the nonpathogenic hantavirus prospect hill virus (phv) failed coprecipitate
traf3 inhibit nf-kappab ifn-beta transcriptional responses. further,
expression ny-1v gn tail blocked tbk1 coprecipitation traf3 and
infection ny-1v, phv, blocked formation tbk1-traf3 complexes.
these findings indicate ny-1v gn cytoplasmic tail forms complex with
traf3 disrupts formation tbk1-traf3 complexes downstream
signaling responses required ifn-beta transcription.
