the hiv-1 vpu protein required efficient viral release human cells.
for hiv-2, envelope (env) protein replaces role vpu. vpu and
hiv-2 env enhance virus release counteracting innate host-cell block within
human cells absent african green monkey (agm) cells. identify 
calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (caml) vpu-interacting host factor
that restricts hiv-1 release. expression human caml (encoded camlg) agm 
cells conferred strong restriction virus release reversed vpu
and hiv-2 env, suggesting caml mechanistic link two
viral regulators. depletion caml human cells eliminated need vpu in
enhancing hiv-1 murine leukemia virus release. results point caml as
a vpu-sensitive host restriction factor inhibits hiv release human
cells. ability caml inhibit virus release illuminate new
therapeutic strategies hiv.
