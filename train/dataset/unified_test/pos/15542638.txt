the epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear antigen 3c (ebna3c) virus-encoded
latent antigen essential primary b-cell transformation. report we
demonstrate although carboxy terminus ebna3c predominantly regulates 
cyclin a-dependent kinase activity, region greatest affinity cyclin 
lies within ebna3 amino-terminal homology domain ebna3c. detailed mapping 
studies employing vitro binding assays coimmunoprecipitation
experiments implicated small region ebna3c, amino acids 130 159 within
the ebna3 homology domain, greatest affinity cyclin a. the
ebna3 homology domain highest degree amino acid similarity
(approximately 30%) ebna3 proteins, and, indeed, ebna3b, not
ebna3a, showed binding activity cyclin a. also show ebna3c binds 
the alpha1 helix highly conserved mammalian cyclin box, cyclin a
amino acids 206 226 required strong binding ebna3c amino acids 130 to
159. interestingly, ebna3c also bound human cyclins d1 e vitro, although
the affinity approximately 30% seen cyclin a. previously was
demonstrated full-length ebna3c rescues p27-mediated suppression cyclin
a-dependent kinase activity (j. s. knight e. s. robertson, j. virol.
78:1981-1991, 2004). also demonstrated carboxy terminus ebna3c
recapitulates phenotype. surprisingly, amino terminus ebna3c the
highest affinity cyclin unable rescue p27 suppression kinase
activity actually downregulates cyclin activity introduced into
ebv-infected cells. data presented suggests amino terminus of
ebna3c may play important role recruiting cyclin complexes, the
carboxy terminus ebna3c necessary functional modulation cyclin a
complex kinase activity.
