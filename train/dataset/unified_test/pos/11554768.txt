the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (vsv g) model transmembrane
glycoprotein extensively used study exocytotic pathway. 
cytoplasmic domain vsv g contains information several intracellular
sorting steps including efficient export er, basolateral delivery, and
endocytosis. order identify proteins potentially interact the
polypeptide sorting motifs vsv g tail, carboxy-terminal 27 amino acids
of vsv g used bait yeast two-hybrid system. protein identified
most frequently screen novel protein 38 kda, p38. present
work, initial molecular biochemical characterization p38 described.
preliminary evidence suggests p38 may interact transiently endoplasmic 
reticulum (er) membranes, thus may affect vsv g cargo movement at
the step er golgi traffic.
