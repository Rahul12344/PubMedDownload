adeno-associated virus (aav) human parvovirus replicates cells 
coinfected helper virus, adenovirus herpes simplex virus type 1
(hsv-1). previously showed nine hsv-1 factors able support aav rep
gene expression genome replication. elucidate strategy aav
replication presence hsv-1, undertook proteomic analysis of
cellular hsv-1 factors associated rep proteins thus potentially
recruited within aav replication compartments (aav rcs). study resulted in
the identification approximately 60 cellular proteins, among factors
involved dna rna metabolism represented largest functional categories.
validation analyses indicated cellular dna replication enzymes rpa, rfc,
and pcna recruited within hsv-1-induced aav rcs. polymerase delta not
identified subsequently shown colocalize rep within aav rcs even 
in presence hsv-1 polymerase complex. addition, found aav
replication associated recruitment components the
mre11/rad50/nbs1 complex, ku70 -86, mismatch repair proteins msh2,
-3, -6. finally, several hsv-1 factors also found associated 
rep, including ul12. demonstrated first time protein plays a
role aav replication enhancing resolution aav replicative forms 
and aav particle production. altogether, analyses provide basis to
understand aav adapts replication strategy nuclear environment
induced helper virus.
