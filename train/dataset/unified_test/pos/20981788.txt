hepatitis b spliced protein (hbsp) encoded 2.2 kb singly spliced hepatitis b
virus (hbv) pre-genomic rna (spliced positions 2447 489 nt) is
involved pathogenesis hbv infection, whereas exact mechanism far
from fully elucidated. study, yeast two-hybrid system using hbsp 
as bait employed screen binding partners hbsp human liver cdna 
library. interaction hbsp fibrinogen γ chain (fgg) further
confirmed vitro using gst pull-down assay confirmed vivo using a
mammalian two-hybrid assay co-immunoprecipitation. identified that
this interaction mediated n terminal 47 amino acid residues hbsp.
hbsp could inhibit fibrin polymerization, factor xiiia-mediated fibrin
cross-linking, adhesion platelets fibrinogen adp-stimulated platelet
aggregation. however, interaction-mediating fragment 1-47 hbsp not
sufficient inhibitory activity fibrinogen function. findings
suggested hbsp may participate hemostatic abnormality patients
with hbv-related liver diseases.
