human papillomaviruses (hpvs) high-risk group associated with
cervical cancer, contrast hpvs low-risk group associated
with benign lesions genital tract. here, show high-risk, not
low-risk hpv e2 proteins, promote mitotic block, often followed by
metaphase-specific apoptosis, independent viral oncogenes e6 
and e7. high-risk hpv e2-expressing cells also show polyploidy, chromosomal
mis-segregation centrosome amplification leading genomic instability. we
link defects specific unusually strong interaction between
high-risk e2 cdc20 cdh1, two activators anaphase promoting
complex (apc), abnormal localization cdh1, accumulation apc substrates 
like cyclin b, vivo. finding high-risk, low-risk hpv e2
proteins, induce genomic instability, raises intriguing possibility e2
proteins play role oncogenic potential high-risk papillomaviruses.
