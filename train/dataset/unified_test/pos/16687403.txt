tat critical viral transactivator essential human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) gene expression. activation involves binding rna stem-loop structure 
and recruitment positive transcription elongation factor b. tat also
induces remodeling single nucleosome hiv promoter. however, the
mechanism remodeling remained unclear. knockdown ini-1 brg-1, 
two components swi/snf chromatin-remodeling complex, suppressed
tat-mediated transactivation. cells lacking ini-1 (g401 mon) brg-1 (c33a) 
exhibited defective transactivation tat restored upon ini-1 brg-1
expression, respectively. tat co-immunoprecipitated several swi/snf
subunits, including ini-1, brg-1, beta-actin. swi/snf complex interacted 
with integrated hiv promoter tat-dependent manner. also found that
ini-1 brg-1 synergized p300 acetyltransferase activate hiv
promoter. synergism depended acetyltransferase activity p300 and
on tat lys(50) lys(51). conclusion, tat-mediated activation hiv
promoter requires swi/snf complex synergy coactivator p300.
