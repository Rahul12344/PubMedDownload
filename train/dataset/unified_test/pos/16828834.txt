we reported tyrosine-phosphorylated forms cellular protein,
fkbp52, inhibit second-strand dna synthesis adeno-associated virus 2
(aav), leading inefficient transgene expression recombinant aav vectors. 
to explore role fkbp52 aav-mediated transduction, we
established murine embryo fibroblasts (mefs) cultures fkbp52 wild-type (wt),
heterozygous (he), knockout (ko) mice. conventional aav vectors failed to
transduce wt mefs efficiently, transduction efficiency not
significantly increased ko mefs. aav vectors failed traffic
efficiently nucleus cells. treatment hydroxyurea (hu)
increased transduction efficiency conventional aav vectors by
approximately 25-fold wt mefs, approximately 4-fold ko mefs.
the use self-complementary aav (scaav) vectors, bypass requirement
of viral second-strand dna synthesis, revealed hu treatment increased the
transduction efficiency approximately 23-fold wt mefs, approximately 
4-fold ko mefs, indicating lack hu treatment-mediated increase 
ko mefs due failure aav undergo viral second-strand dna
synthesis. following hu treatment, approximately 59% aav genomes present 
in nuclear fraction wt mefs, approximately 28% ko mefs,
indicating pathway hu treatment mediates nuclear transport of
aav impaired ko mefs. ko mefs stably transfected fkbp52 
expression plasmid, hu treatment-mediated increase transduction efficiency
was restored cells, correlated directly improved
intracellular trafficking. intact aav particles also shown interact 
fkbp52 well dynein, known cellular protein involved aav
trafficking. studies suggest fkbp52, cellular chaperone
protein, facilitates intracellular trafficking aav, implications 
the optimal use recombinant aav vectors human gene therapy.
