the major target tissues epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection b lymphocytes
and epithelial cells oropharyngeal zone. product ebv bzlf1
early gene, eb1, member basic leucine-zipper family transcription
factors, interacts viral cellular promoters transcription
factors, modulating reactivation latent ebv infection. here, we
characterize novel cellular protein interacting basic domains eb1
and c-jun, competing binding ap1 consensus site. the
transcript present wide variety human adult, fetal, tumor tissues,
and protein detected nuclei throughout human epidermis as
either grainy punctuate nuclear staining cultured keratinocytes. the
overexpression tagged cdna constructs keratinocytes revealed nh(2)
terminus essential nuclear localization, central domain is
responsible interaction eb1 phenotype transfected
keratinocytes similar terminal differentiation. gene identified in
tail-to-tail orientation periplakin gene (ppl) human chromosome
16p13.3 syntenic region mouse chromosome 16. designated novel
ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein ubinuclein corresponding gene
as ubn1.
