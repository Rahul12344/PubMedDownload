an estimated 50 million dengue virus (denv) infections occur annually more
than forty percent human population currently risk developing
dengue fever (df) dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf). despite prevalence and
potential severity df dhf, approved vaccines antiviral
therapeutics available. improved understanding denv immune evasion is
pivotal rational development anti-denv therapeutics. antagonism of
type interferon (ifn-i) signaling crucial mechanism denv immune
evasion. denv ns5 protein inhibits ifn-i signaling mediating
proteasome-dependent stat2 degradation. proteolytically-processed ns5 can
efficiently mediate stat2 degradation, though unprocessed processed ns5 
bind stat2. identify ubr4, 600-kda member n-recognin family, 
an interacting partner denv ns5 preferentially binds processed ns5.
our results also demonstrate denv ns5 bridges stat2 ubr4. furthermore,
we show ubr4 promotes denv-mediated stat2 degradation, importantly,
that ubr4 necessary efficient viral replication ifn-i competent cells. 
our data underscore importance ns5-mediated stat2 degradation denv
replication identify ubr4 host protein specifically exploited by
denv inhibit ifn-i signaling via stat2 degradation.
