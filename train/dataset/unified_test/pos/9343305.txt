in previous study, infection mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) was
shown increase sensitivity mammary epithelium toward prolactin
(prl); furthermore, effect could mimicked binding mmtv
envelope protein (gp52) cell receptor. present work investigated
the possibility gp52-induced changes prl receptor (prlr) were
responsible phenomenon. vitro, gp52 doubled prlr concentration in
the plasmalemma mammary epithelium without affecting affinity. origins
of prlrs twofold: first, gp52 stimulated prlr mrna nearly fivefold,
suggesting receptors newly synthesized. second, a
redistribution prlrs within mammary cell: prlrs shifted an
internal pool plasma membrane. relocation rapid, occurring
within 30 min. appear contribution alterations in
prlr degradation, since half-life prlr affected gp52. in
summary, mmtv increases prl sensitivity mouse mammary epithelium by
elevating prlrs enhanced synthesis recruitment microsomes.
