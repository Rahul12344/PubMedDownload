cellular mismatch base-excision repair machineries shown be
involved epstein-barr virus (ebv) lytic dna replication. report that
nucleotide-excision repair (ner) may also play important role ebv lytic dna
replication. firstly, ebv bglf4 kinase interacts xeroderma pigmentosum c
(xpc), critical dna damage-recognition factor ner, yeast vitro, 
as demonstrated yeast two-hybrid glutathione s-transferase pull-down
assays. simultaneously, xpc shown, indirect immunofluorescence and
co-immunoprecipitation assays, interact colocalize bglf4 in
ebv-positive na cells undergoing lytic viral replication. addition, the
efficiency ebv dna replication reduced 30-40 % xpc small
interfering rna. expression bglf4 enhances cellular dna-repair activity in
p53-defective h1299/bcl2 cells host-cell reactivation assay. this
enhancement observed xpc-mutant cell line xp4pa-sv unless
complemented ectopic xpc, suggesting bglf4 may stimulate dna repair an
xpc-dependent manner. overall, suggest interaction bglf4 xpc
may involved dna replication repair thereby enhance efficiency 
of viral dna replication.
