apoptosis induction antiviral host response, however, influenza virus
(iav) infection promotes host cell death. nucleoprotein (np) iav known 
to contribute viral pathogenesis, role virus-induced host cell
death hitherto unknown. observed np contributes iav infection
induced cell death heterologous expression np alone induce apoptosis
in human airway epithelial cells. apoptotic effect iav np significant 
when compared known proapoptotic proteins iav. cell death
induced iav np executed intrinsic apoptosis pathway. we
screened host cellular factors may targeted np inducing 
apoptosis identified human antiapoptotic protein clusterin (clu) novel
interacting partner. interaction iav np clu highly conserved 
and mediated Î²-chain clu protein. also clu found interact
specifically iav np known apoptosis modulatory
protein iav. clu prevents induction intrinsic apoptosis pathway by
binding bax inhibiting movement mitochondria. found that
the expression iav np reduced association clu bax mammalian
cells. further, observed clu overexpression attenuated np-induced cell
death negative effect iav replication. collectively, findings 
indicate new function iav np inducing host cell death suggest role
for host antiapoptotic protein clu process.
