the enteroviruses poliovirus (pv), coxsackie b virus (cvb) rhinovirus (hrv)
are members picornaviridae inhibit host cell translation early in
infection. enterovirus translation soon predominates infected cells, but
eventually also shuts off. complex pattern modulation translation
suggests regulation multifactorial mechanism. report eif5b is
proteolytically cleaved pv cvb infection cultured cells, beginning 
at 3 hours post-infection increasing thereafter. recombinant pv, cvb hrv 
3cpro cleaved purified native rabbit eukaryotic initiation factor (eif) 5b in
vitro single site (vveqg, equivalent vmeqg479 human eif5b) is
consistent cleavage specificity enterovirus 3c proteases. cleavage
separates n-terminal domain eif5b essential conserved central
gtpase c-terminal domains. 3cpro-mediated cleavage eif5b may thus play 
accessory role shutoff translation occurs enterovirus-infected 
cells.
