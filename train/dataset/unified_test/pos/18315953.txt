hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) essential hepatitis b virus infection
and exerts pleiotropic effect various cellular machineries. hbx been
also demonstrated indirect transcriptional transactivator various
different viral cellular promoters. addition, hbx involved the
development various liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma. however
the mechanism hbx hepatocellular carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. in
this study, identify possible new cellular proteins interacting hbx, we
carried yeast two-hybrid assay. obtained several possible cellular
partners including vbp1, binding factor vhl tumor suppressor protein. the
direct physical interaction hbx vbp1 vitro vivo was
confirmed immunoprecipitation assay. addition, found vbp1
facilitates hbx-induced nfkappab activation cell proliferation. results
implicate important role hbx development hepatocellular
carcinoma interaction vbp1.
