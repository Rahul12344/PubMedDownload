the epstein-barr virus (ebv) ebna1 protein important replication and
mitotic segregation ebv genomes latently infected cells also activates 
the transcription viral latency genes. gly-arg-rich region
between amino acids 325 376 required segregation and
transcriptional activation functions ebna1. show region is
modified arginine methylation serine phosphorylation. mutagenesis 
the four potentially phosphorylated serines region indicated that
phosphorylation multiple serines contributes efficient segregation of
ebv-based plasmids ebna1, least part increasing ebna1 binding to
hebp2. ebna1 also found bind arginine methyltransferases prmt1 and
prmt5. multiple arginines 325-376 region methylated vitro prmt1
and prmt5, n-terminal gly-arg-rich region amino acids 41 and
50. ebna1 also shown methylated vivo, predominantly 325-376
region. treatment cells methylation inhibitor down-regulation of
prmt1 altered ebna1 localization, resulting formation ebna1 rings
around nucleoli. results indicate ebna1 function influenced by
both serine phosphorylation arginine methylation.
