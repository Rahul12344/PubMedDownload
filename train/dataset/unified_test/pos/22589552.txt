origin recognition complex (orc) plays essential role directing assembly of
prereplicative complex selective sites chromosomes. however, orc from
vertebrates reported bind dna sequence-nonspecific manner, it
is still unclear selects specific genomic loci cdc6, another
conserved aaa(+) factor known interact orc, participates process.
replication orip, latent origin epstein-barr virus, provides an
excellent model system study initiation host chromosomes
because known depend prereplicative complex factors, including orc
and mcm. here, show orc recruited selectively essential dyad
symmetry element nuclear extracts manner dependent ebna1, which
specifically binds dyad symmetry. purified proteins, ebna1 recruit
both cdc6 orc independently dna containing ebna1 binding sites, cdc6
facilitates orc recruitment ebna1. purified cdc6 directly binds ebna1, 
whereas association orc ebna1 requires presence orip dna.
nuclease protection assays suggest orc associates dna segments 
sides adjacent ebna1 binding sites process stimulated 
the presence cdc6. thus, ebna1 direct localized assembly orc a
process facilitated cdc6. possibility similar modes of
recruitment orc/cdc6 human chromosomal origins discussed.
