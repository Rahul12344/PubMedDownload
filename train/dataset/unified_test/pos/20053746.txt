the adenovirus (adv) oncoprotein e1a stimulates cell proliferation inhibits
differentiation. activities primarily linked n-terminal region
(exon 1) e1a, interacts multiple cellular protein complexes. c 
terminus (exon 2) e1a antagonizes processes, mediated part through
interaction c-terminal binding proteins 1 2 (ctbp1/2). identify
additional cellular e1a targets involved modulation e1a
c-terminus-mediated activities, undertook tandem affinity purification of
e1a-associated proteins. mass spectrometric analysis, identified
several known e1a-interacting proteins well novel e1a targets, 
forkhead transcription factors, foxk1/k2. identified ser/thr-containing
sequence motif e1a mediated interaction foxk1/k2. demonstrated
that e6 proteins two beta-human papillomaviruses (hpv14 hpv21)
associated epidermodysplasia verruciformis also interacted foxk1/k2
through motif similar e1a. e1a mutants deficient interaction 
with foxk1/k2 induced enhanced cell proliferation oncogenic transformation.
the hypertransforming activity mutant e1a suppressed hpv21 e6. an
e1a-e6 chimeric protein containing ser/thr domain e6 protein e1a
interacted efficiently foxk1/k2 inhibited cell transformation. our
results suggest targeting foxk1/k2 may common mechanism certain
beta-hpvs adv5. e1a exon 2 mutants deficient interaction the
dual-specificity kinases dyrk1a/1b cofactor han11 also induced
increased cell proliferation transformation. results suggest e1a
c-terminal region may suppress cell proliferation oncogenic transformation
through interaction three different cellular protein complexes: foxk1/k2,
dyrk(1a/1b)/han11, ctbp1/2.
