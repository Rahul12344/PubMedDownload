hepatitis c virus (hcv) leading cause chronic liver disease worldwide and
establishes persistent infection 60% infected individuals. this
high frequency persistent infection indicates hcv evolved efficient
strategies interfere adaptive innate immune response to
occupy use host cell infrastructure. present study provides evidence that
c-src, member src family kinases participates many signal
transduction pathways, represents essential host factor exploited viral
replication. c-src directly interacts viral rna-dependent rna polymerase
(ns5b) via sh3 domain nonstructural phosphoprotein ns5a via 
sh2 domain. interactions required maintain protein-protein
interaction ns5a ns5b, previously demonstrated be
essential viral replication. accordingly, hcv genome replication and
production viral proteins strongly reduced upon small interfering
rna-mediated knockdown c-src presence tyrosine kinase
inhibitor herbimycin a. effect could rescued supplementation of
the two ubiquitously expressed src family kinases fyn yes.conclusion:
our data suggest c-src participates formation ns5a/ns5b protein
complex required efficient replication hcv.
