epstein-barr virus (ebv) attachment primary b cells initiates virus entry.
although cd21 known receptor ebvgp350/220, recent report
documents ebv-infected b cells patient genetically deficient cd21. on
normal resting b cells, cd21 forms two membrane complexes: one cd19 and
another cd35. whereas cd21/cd19 complex widely retained on
immortalized b cell tumor lines, related complement-regulatory protein
cd35 lost. determine role(s) cd35 initial infection, we
transduced cd21-negative pre-b cell myeloid leukemia line cd35, cd21, 
or both. cells expressing cd35 alone bound gp350/220 became latently infected
when fusion receptor hla ii coexpressed. temporal, biophysical, and
structural characteristics cd35-mediated infection distinct cd21.
identification cd35 ebv receptor uncovers salient role primary
infection, addresses unsettled questions virus tropism, underscores the
importance ebvgp350/220 vaccine development.
