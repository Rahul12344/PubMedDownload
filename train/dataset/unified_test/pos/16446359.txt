ubiquitin e3 ligases important cellular components endoplasmic reticulum 
(er)-associated degradation due role substrate-specific
ubiquitination, required retrotranslocation (dislocation) most
unwanted proteins er cytosol proteasome degradation. however,
our understanding molecular mechanisms e3 ligases confer
substrate-specific recognition, role substrate retrotranslocation is
limited especially mammalian cells. mk3 type iii er membrane protein
encoded murine gamma herpesvirus 68. conferred n-terminal ring-ch
domain, mk3 e3 ubiquitin ligase activity. role immune evasion
protein, mk3 specifically targets nascent major histocompatibility complex class 
i heavy chains (hc) rapid degradation. mechanism mk3 extracts hc
from er membrane cytosol proteasome-mediated degradation is
unknown. evidence presented hc down-regulation mk3 dependent
on p97 aaa-atpase. contrast, kk5 protein kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus p97-independent despite fact is
highly homologous mk3. mk3 protein also found physical association with
derlin1, er protein recently implicated retrotranslocation hc by
immune evasion protein us11, us2, human cytomegalovirus. the
mechanistic implications findings discussed.
