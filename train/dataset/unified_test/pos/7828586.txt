the x gene human hepatitis b virus encodes polypeptide hbx which
transactivates viral host genes variety cis-acting enhancer
elements present rna polymerases i, ii iii promoters. better understand
the mechanism x transactivation, cloned cdnas proteins bind hbx.
here demonstrate one cdnas full-length cdna human rpb5, 
a subunit shared rna polymerases. hbx transactivation domain the
central region human rpb5 necessary specific binding two
proteins shown by: (i) vitro assays using deletion mutants fusion
proteins; (ii) vivo assays detect associated proteins by
co-immunoprecipitation non-fused proteins transfected hepg2 cells.
over-expressed hbx seemed associate assembled forms endogenous human
rpb5 hbx-transfected cells, since endogenous rpb5 co-immunoprecipitated
with hbx. hbx binding region human rpb5 stimulated
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities several different reporters
having x-responsive element(s). results support idea interaction
of hbx human rpb5 facilitate hbx transactivation human rpb5 
a domain communicate transcriptional regulators.
