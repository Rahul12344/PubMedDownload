bovine papillomavirus 1 e6 interacts two similar proteins regulate cell
attachment cell migration called paxillin (pxn) hic-5 (also known as
hic5, ara55, hic-5, tsc-5, tgfb1i1). despite similarity hic-5 and
paxillin, paxillin required e6 transform mouse embryo fibroblasts while
hic-5 not. using mutants paxillin, found dynamic competitive
interactions e6, focal adhesion kinase, git1 arf-gap protein 
binding paxillin required sufficient transformation e6.
using mutants paxillin chimeric proteins hic-5 paxillin, we
demonstrate critical difference hic-5 paxillin within the
lim domains paxillin directly interact e6. mutational
analysis indicates least six distinct domains paxillin required
for e6 transformation.importance: papillomaviruses cause epitheliomas in
vertebrates actions virus-encoded oncoproteins. despite the
immense diversity papillomavirus types, understanding mechanisms by
which virus-encoded e6 oncoproteins contribute cell transformation is
restricted human papillomavirus types associated cancer. bovine 
papillomavirus 1 (bpv-1) e6 served model system studies e6
structure function. study examines mechanisms bpv-1 e6
association cellular focal adhesion adapter protein paxillin contributes
to cell transformation extends knowledge diverse mechanisms by
which papillomaviruses transform host cells.
