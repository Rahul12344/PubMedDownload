the e6 proteins high-risk genital human papillomaviruses (hpv), hpv
types 16 18, possess conserved c-terminal pdz-binding motif, mediates
interaction cellular pdz domain proteins. binding e6 usually
results ubiquitin-mediated degradation. ability e6 bind pdz
domain proteins correlates oncogenic potential. using yeast two-hybrid
system, gst pull-down experiments coimmunoprecipitations, identified the
protein tyrosine phosphatase h1 (ptph1/ptpn3) novel target the
pdz-binding motif e6 hpv16 18. ptph1 suggested function 
tumour suppressor protein, since mutational analysis revealed somatic mutations
in ptph1 minor fraction various human tumours. show hpv16 e6
accelerated proteasome-mediated degradation ptph1, required the
binding e6 cellular ubiquitin ligase e6-ap ptph1. endogenous
levels ptph1 particularly low hpv-positive cervical carcinoma cell
lines. reintroduction e2 protein hpv16-positive cervical
carcinoma cell line siha, known lead sharp repression e6 expression
and induce growth suppression, resulted increase amount ptph1.
our data suggest reducing level ptph1 may contribute oncogenic
activity high-risk genital e6 proteins.
