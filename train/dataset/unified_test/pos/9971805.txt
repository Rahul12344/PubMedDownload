the influenza virus genome transcribed nuclei infected cells but
assembled progeny virions cytoplasm. reflected the
cellular distribution virus nucleoprotein (np), protein which
encapsidates genomic rna form ribonucleoprotein structures. early times
postinfection np found nucleus, later times found
predominantly cytoplasm. np contains several sequences proposed act 
nuclear localization signals (nlss), clear overridden
to allow cytoplasmic accumulation protein. find np binds tightly
to filamentous actin vitro identified cluster residues np
essential interaction. complexes containing rna, np, actin could be
formed, suggesting viral ribonucleoproteins also bind actin. cells,
exogenously expressed np expressed high level partitioned the
cytoplasm, associated f-actin stress fibers. contrast, mutants
unable bind f-actin efficiently imported nucleus even under
conditions high-level expression. similarly, nuclear import nls-deficient
np molecules restored concomitant disruption f-actin binding. we
propose interaction np f-actin causes cytoplasmic retention 
of influenza virus ribonucleoproteins.
