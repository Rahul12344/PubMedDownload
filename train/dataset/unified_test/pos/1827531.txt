the hepatitis b virus (hbv) x gene product trans-activates viral cellular
genes. x protein (px) bind independently nucleic acids. data 
presented demonstrate px entered protein-protein complex with
the cellular transcriptional factors creb atf-2 altered dna binding
specificities. although creb atf-2 alone bind hbv enhancer
element, px-creb px-atf-2 complex bind hbv enhancer. thus, the
ability px interact cellular factors broadened dna binding
specificity regulatory proteins provides mechanism px to
participate transcriptional regulation. strategy altered binding
specificity may modify repertoire genes regulated by
transcriptional factors viral infection.
