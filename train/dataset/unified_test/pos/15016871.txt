the lipid raft membrane shown site hepatitis c virus (hcv) 
rna replication. mechanism formation replication complex not
clear. show formation hcv rna replication complex on
lipid raft (detergent-resistant membranes) requires interactions among hcv
nonstructural (ns) proteins may initiated precursor ns4b, 
has intrinsic property anchoring lipid raft membrane. hepatocyte
cell lines containing hcv rna replicon, ns proteins,
including ns5a, ns5b, ns3, also localized detergent-resistant
membranes. however, individually expressed, ns4b associated
exclusively lipid raft. contrast, ns5b ns3 localized to
detergent-sensitive membrane cytosolic fractions, respectively. ns5a was
localized detergent-sensitive -resistant membrane fractions.
furthermore, show cellular vesicle membrane transport protein named
hvap-33 (the human homologue 33-kda vesicle-associated membrane
protein-associated protein), binds ns5a ns5b, plays critical 
role formation hcv replication complex. hvap-33 protein is
partially associated detergent-resistant membrane fraction. the
expression dominant-negative mutants small interfering rna hvap-33 in
hcv replicon cells resulted relocation ns5b detergent-resistant to
detergent-sensitive membranes. correspondingly, amounts hcv rna and
proteins cells reduced, indicating hvap-33 critical the
formation hcv replication complex rna replication. results indicate 
that protein-protein interactions among various hcv ns proteins hvap-33
are important formation hcv replication complex.
