in study, demonstrate coactivator-associated arginine
methyltransferase 1 (carm1), methylates histone h3 proteins 
as p300/cbp, positively involved regulation tax transactivation.
first, transfection studies demonstrated overexpression carm1 wild-type
protein resulted increased tax transactivation human t-cell
lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) long terminal repeat (ltr). contrast,
transfection catalytically inactive carm1 methyltransferase mutant not
enhance tax transactivation. carm1 facilitated tax transactivation the
creb-dependent cellular gem promoter. direct physical interaction between
htlv-1 tax carm1 demonstrated using vitro glutathione
s-transferase-tax binding assays, vivo coimmunoprecipitation, confocal
microscopy experiments. finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis the
activated htlv-1 ltr promoter showed association carm1 methylated
histone h3 template dna. vitro, tax facilitates binding carm1 
to transcription complex. together, data provide evidence carm1
enhances tax transactivation htlv-1 ltr direct interaction
between carm1 tax binding promotes methylation histone h3 (r2,
r17, r26).
