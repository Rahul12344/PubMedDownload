the k1l protein vaccinia virus required growth certain cell
lines (rk-13 human). cowpox host-range protein cp77 shown to
complement k1l function rk-13 cells, despite lack homology the
two proteins except ankyrin repeats. investigated role ankyrin
repeats k1l protein rk-13 cells. growth recombinant vaccinia
virus, k1l gene mutated conserved ankyrin repeat, severely
impaired. infection mutant virus caused shutdown cellular viral
protein synthesis early infection. also investigated interaction k1l
protein cellular proteins found k1l interacts rabbit
homologue human acap2, gtpase-activating protein ankyrin repeats. our
result suggests importance ankyrin repeat host-range function k1l
in rk-13 cells identifies acap2 cellular protein, may be
interacting k1l.
