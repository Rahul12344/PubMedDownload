human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gene expression activated tat, 
a virally encoded protein. tat trans-activation requires viral
(trans-activation--responsive; tar) rna sequences located r region 
long terminal repeat (ltr). existing evidence suggests tat probably
cooperates cellular factors bind tar rna overall
trans-activation process. hela complementary dna isolated characterized
that encodes tar rna-binding protein (trbp). trbp activated hiv-1 ltr and
was synergistic tat function.
