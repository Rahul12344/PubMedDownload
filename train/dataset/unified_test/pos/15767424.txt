several viral proteins expressed dna rna transforming viruses the
particular property binding via c-terminal end various cellular
proteins pdz domains. study focused pdz protein tip-2/gipc,
which originally identified two-hybrid screens performed two
different baits: human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax oncoprotein the
regulator g signaling rgs-gaip. studies shown tip-2/gipc 
also able associate cytoplasmic domains various transmembrane
proteins. report show tip-2/gipc interacts e6 protein of
human papillomavirus type 18 (hpv-18). event triggers polyubiquitination and
proteasome-mediated degradation cellular protein. agreement this
observation, silencing e6 rna interference hela cells causes increase
in intracellular tip-2/gipc level. pdz protein previously found
to involved transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) signaling by
favoring expression tgf-beta type iii receptor cell membrane. in
line activity tip-2/gipc, observed depletion protein
in hela cells hampers induction id3 gene tgf-beta treatment also
diminishes antiproliferative effect cytokine. conversely, silencing
of e6 increases expression id3 blocks proliferation hela cells.
these results support notion hpv-18 e6 renders cells less sensitive to
the cytostatic effect tgf-beta lowering intracellular amount of
tip-2/gipc.
