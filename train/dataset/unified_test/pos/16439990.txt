apoptosis represents important cellular defence mechanism viral
pathogens virtue ability remove infected cells. consequently, many
viruses developed numerous strategies prevent delay host cell
apoptosis order achieve productive replication. report that
deletion f1l gene vaccinia genome results increased apoptosis 
during infection. demonstrate f1l, sequence homology to
bcl-2 family members, inhibits apoptosis level mitochondria binding 
to bak. consequence, f1l prevents bak activation, oligomerization and
interaction active bax, critical steps induction apoptosis. we
demonstrate residues 64-84 f1l interact directly bcl-2 homology 
domain 3 (bh3) domain bak. region f1l limited sequence similarity 
to known bak-interacting bh3 domains. also find additional bh3-like 
domains exist vaccinia genome. conclude f1l uses specific,
bh3-like domain bind inhibit bak mitochondria.
