egress newly assembled herpesvirus particles infected cells highly
dynamic process involving host secretory pathway working concert with
viral components. elucidate location, dynamics, molecular mechanisms
of alpha herpesvirus egress, developed live-cell fluorescence microscopy
method visualize final transport exocytosis pseudorabies virus
(prv) particles non-polarized epithelial cells. method based total 
internal reflection fluorescence (tirf) microscopy selectively image
fluorescent virus particles near plasma membrane, takes advantage a
virus-encoded ph-sensitive probe visualize precise moment location 
particle exocytosis. performed single-particle tracking mean squared
displacement analysis characterize particle motion, imaged panel of
cellular proteins identify spatially dynamically associated with
viral exocytosis. based data, individual virus particles travel the
plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. rab gtpases, rab6a,
rab8a, rab11a, key regulators plasma membrane-directed secretory
pathway, present virus secretory vesicle. vesicles undergo fast,
directional transport directly site exocytosis, most
frequently near patches ll5Î², part complex anchors microtubules to
the plasma membrane. vesicles tightly docked site exocytosis for
several seconds, membrane fusion occurs, displacing virion small
distance across plasma membrane. exocytosis, particles remain tightly
confined outer cell surface. based recent reports cell
biological alpha herpesvirus literature, combined spatial and
dynamic data viral egress, propose integrated model links together 
the intracellular transport pathways exocytosis mechanisms mediate alpha
herpesvirus egress.
