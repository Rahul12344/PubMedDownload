cytomegaloviruses manipulate host chemokine/receptor axis altering
cellular chemokine expression encoding multiple chemokines chemokine
receptors. similar human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), rat cytomegalovirus (rcmv)
encodes multiple cc chemokine-analogous proteins, including r129 (hcmv ul128
homologue) r131 (hcmv ul130 mcmv m129/130 homologues). although these
proteins play role cmv entry, function chemotactic cytokines
remains unknown. current study, examined role rcmv chemokine
r129 promoting cellular migration accelerating transplant vascular
sclerosis (tvs) rat heart transplant model. determined r129
protein released culture supernatants infected cells expressed 
with late viral gene kinetics rcmv infection highly expressed heart
and salivary glands vivo rat infections. using recombinant r129
protein, demonstrated r129 induces migration lymphocytes isolated from
rat peripheral blood, spleen, bone marrow rat macrophage cell
line. using antibody-mediated cell sorting rat splenocytes, demonstrated
that r129 induces migration naïve/central memory cd4(+) cells. through
ligand-binding assays, determined r129 binds rat cc chemokine receptors
ccr3, ccr4, ccr5, ccr7. addition, mutational analyses identified
functional domains r129 resulting recombinant proteins fail induce 
migration (r129-δnt -c31a) alter chemotactic ability chemokine 
(r129-f43a). two mutant proteins (r129-c31a -δnt) also act dominant
negatives inhibiting migration induced wild-type r129. furthermore,
infection rat heart transplant recipients rcmv containing r129-δnt
mutation prevented cmv-induced acceleration tvs. together findings
indicate rcmv r129 highly chemotactic, important implications
during rcmv infection reactivation acceleration tvs.
