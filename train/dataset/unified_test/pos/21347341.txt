ebna3c, one epstein-barr virus (ebv)-encoded latent antigens, essential
for primary b-cell transformation. cyclin d1, key regulator g1 phase
progression, tightly associated aberrantly expressed numerous human
cancers. previously, ebna3c shown bind cyclin d1 vitro along with
cyclin cyclin e. present study, provide evidence which
demonstrates ebna3c forms complex cyclin d1 human cells. detailed 
mapping experiments show small n-terminal region lies amino 
acids 130-160 ebna3c binds two different sites cyclin d1- n-terminal
prb binding domain (residues 1-50), c-terminal domain (residues 171-240),
known regulate cyclin d1 stability. cyclin d1 short-lived and
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation targeted means of
therapeutic intervention. here, show ebna3c stabilizes cyclin d1 
inhibition poly-ubiquitination, also increases nuclear
localization blocking gsk3Î² activity. show ebna3c enhances the
kinase activity cyclin d1/cdk6 enables subsequent ubiquitination and
degradation prb. ebna3c together cyclin d1-cdk6 complex also efficiently 
nullifies inhibitory effect prb cell growth. moreover, sh-rna based 
strategy knock-down cyclin d1 ebna3c genes ebv transformed
lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) shows significant reduction cell-growth.
based results, propose ebna3c stabilize well enhance
the functional activity cyclin d1 thereby facilitating g1-s transition 
ebv transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines.
