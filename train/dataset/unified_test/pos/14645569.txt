papillomaviruses replicate stratified epithelia skin mucosa. infection 
with certain human papillomavirus (hpv) types main cause anogenital
neoplasia, particular cervical cancer. early events papillomavirus
infectivity poorly understood. heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs)
mediate initial binding cell surface, class proteins carrying
heparan sulfates defined. examined two processes of
papillomavirus infection, attachment virus-like particles (vlp) cells and
infection authentic hpv type 11 (hpv11) virions. hspgs, syndecan-1 is
the major epithelial form strongly upregulated wound edge
keratinocytes. employed k562 cells, lack hspgs except minor amounts of
endogenous betaglycan, stable clones express cdnas syndecan-1,
syndecan-4, glypican-1. binding vlp correlated levels heparan
sulfate cell surface. parental k562 bound hpv16 vlp weakly, whereas all
three k562 transfectants demonstrated enhanced binding, highest binding 
capacity observed syndecan-1-transfected cells, also expressed most
hspg. hpv11 infectivity assays, high virion inoculum required infect
k562 cells, whereas ectopic expression syndecan-1 increased permissiveness
eightfold expression syndecan-4 glypican-1 fourfold. infection of
keratinocytes eliminated treatment heparitinase, not
phospholipase c, implicating syndecan family integral membrane
proteins receptor proteins. human keratinocytes homozygous deletion 
alpha6 integrin permissive hpv11 infection. results indicate that
several hspgs serve hpv receptors support putative role for
syndecan-1, rather alpha6 integrin, primary receptor protein natural
hpv infection keratinocytes.
