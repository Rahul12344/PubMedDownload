hemorrhagic manifestations occur frequently accompanying wide range dengue
disease syndromes. much work focused contribution immune factors to
the pathogenesis hemorrhage, dengue virus (denv) participates the
pathogenic process never explored. although consensus that
apoptosis basis vascular permeability human dengue infections, we
showed dengue hemorrhage mouse model endothelial cell apoptosis is
important hemorrhage development mice. explore molecular basis of
the contribution denv endothelial cell death, show study that
denv protease interacts cellular iκbα iκbβ cleaves them. inducing
iκbα iκbβ cleavage iκb kinase activation, denv protease activates nf-κb, 
which results endothelial cell death. intradermal inoculation denv protease
packaged adenovirus-associated virus-9 induces endothelial cell death and
dermal hemorrhage mice. although h51 activity site involved 
interaction denv protease iκb-α/β, enzymatic activity critical
to ability denv protease induce iκbα iκbβ cleavage trigger
hemorrhage development. moreover, overexpression iκbα iκbβ protects
endothelial cells denv-induced apoptosis. study, show denv
protease participates pathogenesis dengue hemorrhage discover iκbα 
and iκbβ new cellular targets cleaved denv protease.
