host innate immune responses dna viruses involve members the
nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat pyrin domain containing
protein (nlrp) family, form "inflammasomes" activate caspase-1,
resulting proteolytic activation cytokines interleukin (il)-1β il-18.
we hypothesized dna viruses would target inflammasomes overcome host
defense. vaccinia virus (vacv) b-cell cll/lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) homolog, f1l, 
demonstrated bind inhibit nlr family member nlrp1 vitro. moreover, 
infection macrophages culture virus lacking f1l (δf1l) caused
increased caspase-1 activation il-1β secretion compared wild-type virus.
virulence δf1l virus attenuated vivo, causing altered febrile
responses, increased proteolytic processing caspase-1, rapid
inflammation lungs infected mice without affecting cell death virus
replication. furthermore, found hexapeptide f1l necessary and
sufficient inhibiting nlrp1 inflammasome vitro, thus identifying a
peptidyl motif required binding inhibiting nlrp1. functional
importance nlrp1-binding motif confirmed studies of
recombinant δf1l viruses reconstituted either wild-type f1l f1l
mutant fails bind nlrp1. cellular infection wild-type f1l
reconstituted virus-suppressed il-1β production, whereas mutant f1l not. in
contrast, wild-type mutant versions f1l equally suppressed apoptosis.
in vivo, nlr nonbinding f1l mutant virus exhibited attenuated phenotype
similar δf1l virus, thus confirming importance f1l interactions with
nlrp1 viral pathogenicity mice. altogether, findings reveal unique
viral mechanism evading host innate immune responses.
