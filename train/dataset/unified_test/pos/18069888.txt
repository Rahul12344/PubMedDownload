upon viral infection, cells undergo apoptosis defense viral
replication. viruses, turn, evolved elaborate mechanisms subvert
apoptotic processes. here, report novel viral mitochondrial
anti-apoptotic protein (vmap) murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (gammahv-68)
interacts bcl-2 voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (vdac1) a
genetically separable manner. n-terminal region vmap interacted with
bcl-2, interaction markedly increased bcl-2 recruitment to
mitochondria also avidity bh3-only pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby
suppressing bax mitochondrial translocation activation. addition, the
central c-terminal hydrophobic regions vmap interacted vdac1.
consequently, interactions resulted effective inhibition of
cytochrome c release, leading comprehensive inhibition of
mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. finally, vmap gene required efficient
gammahv-68 lytic replication normal cells, mitochondrial
apoptosis-deficient cells. results demonstrate gammahv-68 vmap
independently targets two important regulators mitochondrial
apoptosis-mediated intracellular innate immunity, allowing efficient viral lytic 
replication.
