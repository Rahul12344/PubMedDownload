viruses adjust host cell guarantee life cycle and
survival. aspect virus-host cell interaction probably performed by
viral proteins, serine-threonine kinases, present early during
infection. vaccinia virus early ser-thr kinase, b1r, which, although
required successful viral infection, poorly characterized regarding its
effects cellular proteins, thus, potential contribution to
pathogenesis known. signaling mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)
is mediated assembly complexes kinases jip
scaffold proteins. understand vaccinia virus b1r affect host, 
roles cellular signaling mapk complexes c-jun activation 
studied. independently kinase activity, b1r interact central 
region jip1 scaffold protein. b1r-jip1 complex increases amount of
mapk bound jip1; thus, mkk7 tak1 either bind higher affinity bind 
more stably jip1, increase phosphorylation state of
jnk bound jip1. functional consequence stable interactions
is increase activity transcription factors, c-jun, that
respond complexes. furthermore, b1r also able directly
phosphorylate c-jun residues different targeted jnk and, thus,
b1r also cooperate independent route c-jun activation. vaccinia
virus b1r thus modulate signaling pathways respond cellular
stress.
