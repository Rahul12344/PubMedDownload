enterovirus (ev) infection shown cause marked shutoff host
protein synthesis, event mainly achieved cleavages eukaryotic
translation initiation factors eif4gi eif4gii mediated viral 2a
protease (2a(pro)). using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret), we
developed genetically encoded fret-based biosensors visualize quantify
the specific proteolytic process intact cells. accomplished stable
expression fusion substrate construct composed green fluorescent
protein 2 (gfp(2)) red fluorescent protein 2 (dsred2), cleavage motif 
on eif4gi eif4gii connected between. fret biosensor showed real-time 
and quantifiable impairment fret upon ev infection. levels reduced fret
closely correlated cleavage kinetics endogenous eif4gs isoforms. 
the fret impairments solely attributed 2a(pro) catalytic activity,
irrespective viral-encoded protease, activated caspases general
inhibition protein synthesis ev-infected cells. fret biosensors
appeared universal platform several related evs. spatiotemporal
and quantitative imaging enabled fret shed light protease-substrate
behaviors normal milieu, permitting investigation molecular
mechanism underlying virus-induced host translation inhibition.
