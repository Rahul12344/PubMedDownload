under selective pressure host immunity, viruses retained genes encoding
immunoevasins, molecules interfering host viral recognition clearance.
due binding specificities, immunoevasins exploited affinity
labels identify host-encoded molecules previously unsuspected importance in
defense relevant class virus. previously described an
orthopoxvirus mhc class i-like protein (omcp) binds high affinity to
the activating receptor nkg2d nk cell subsets, implicating nkg2d in
antiorthopoxvirus immunity. study, report omcp also binds an
nkg2d-independent manner b cells monocytes/macrophages. identify murine
fcr-like 5 (fcrl5), orphan immunoregulatory protein highly expressed innate
b lymphocytes, specific receptor omcp. three n-terminal ig domains
of fcrl5 required omcp binding. targeting fcrl5 an
orthopoxvirus immunoevasin strongly implicates contributing host defense
against zoonotic orthopoxviruses.
