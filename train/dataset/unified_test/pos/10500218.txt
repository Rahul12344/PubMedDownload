the interaction two regulatory proteins plays crucial role the
control several biological events, including gene transcription. this
report, demonstrate interaction cellular
sequence-specific single-stranded dna binding protein puralpha hiv type 1
(hiv-1) tat protein mediated specific ribonucleic acids. region tat 
that important interaction puralpha includes region
demonstrated bind tat's viral rna target, tar. 10-nucleotide gc-rich
consensus sequence identified rnas associated puralpha derived human
u-87mg cells plays important role puralpha:tat interaction examined 
by vitro reconstitution assay. furthermore, expression the
puralpha-associated rna cells enhances transcriptional activation the
hiv-1 promoter tat puralpha.
