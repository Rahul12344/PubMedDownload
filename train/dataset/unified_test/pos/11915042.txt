hepatic steatosis hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) common serious
features hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, core protein been
shown play distinct roles pathogenesis. report direct
interaction hcv core protein retinoid x receptor alpha (rxralpha), a
transcriptional regulator controls many aspects cell proliferation,
differentiation, lipid metabolism. core protein binds dna-binding 
domain rxralpha, leading increase dna binding rxralpha its
responsive element. addition, rxralpha activated cells expressing the
core protein well livers core-transgenic mice would
develop hepatic steatosis hcc later lives. using promoter genes of
cellular retinol binding protein ii (crbpii) acyl-coa oxidase reporters,
we also show expression core protein enhances transcriptional
activity regulated rxralpha homodimer well heterodimer with
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha. furthermore, expression 
crbpii gene also up-regulated livers hcv core-transgenic mice. in
conclusion, results suggest modulation rxralpha-controlled gene
expression via interaction core protein contributes pathogenesis 
of hcv infection.
