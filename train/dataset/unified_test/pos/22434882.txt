the homologous cellular coactivators p300 cbp contain intrinsic lysine acetyl
transferase (termed hat) activity. activity responsible acetylation
of several sites histones well modification transcription
factors. previous study, found hbz, encoded human t-cell
leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1), binds multiple domains p300/cbp, including 
the hat domain. study, found hbz inhibits hat activity of
p300/cbp bzip domain viral protein. effect correlated
with reduction h3k18 acetylation, specific target p300/cbp, cells
expressing hbz. interestingly, lower levels h3k18 acetylation detected in
htlv-1 infected cells compared non-infected cells. inhibitory effect of
hbz limited histones, hbz also inhibited acetylation nf-Îºb
subunit, p65, tumor suppressor, p53. recent studies reported that
mutations hat domain p300/cbp cause defect acetylation are
found certain types leukemia. observations suggest inhibition of
the hat activity hbz important development adult t-cell leukemia
associated htlv-1 infection.
