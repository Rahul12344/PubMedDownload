sumo-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier-1) ubiquitin-like family member
that conjugated substrates three discrete enzymatic steps,
activation (involving e1 enzyme (sae1/sae2)), conjugation (involving e2
enzyme), substrate modification (through cooperation e2 e3
protein ligases). adenoviral protein gam1 inactivates e1, vitro and
in vivo, followed sae1/sae2 degradation. shown gam1
possesses c-terminal socs domain allows interaction two cellular 
cullin ring (really interesting new gene) ubiquitin ligases. demonstrate 
gam1 necessary recruitment sae1/sae2 cul2/5-elob/c-roc1
ubiquitin ligase complexes subsequent sae1 ubiquitylation and
degradation. degradation sae2 tightly related gam1 a
consequent effect sae1 disappearance. results reveal mechanism by
which viral protein inactivates subsequently degrades essential cellular
enzyme, arresting key regulatory pathway.
