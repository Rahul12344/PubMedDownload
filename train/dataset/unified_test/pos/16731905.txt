retroviral integrase (in) catalyzes integration viral cdna host
chromosome. additional roles suggested in, including uncoating,
reverse transcription, nuclear import human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) genome. however, underlying mechanism largely unknown.
here, using yeast two-hybrid system, identified survival motor neuron
(smn)-interacting protein 1 (gemin2) binds hiv-1 in. reduction gemin2 
with small interfering rna duplexes (sigemin2) dramatically reduced hiv-1
infection human primary monocyte-derived macrophages also reduced viral
cdna synthesis. contrast, sigemin2 affect hiv-1 expression the
integrated proviral dna. although gemin2 undetectable cell-free viral
particles, coimmunoprecipitation experiments using flag-tagged gemin2 strongly
suggested gemin2 interacts incoming viral genome in.
further experiments reducing smn smn-interacting proteins suggested that
gemin2 might act hiv-1 either alone unknown proteins facilitate
efficient viral cdna synthesis soon infection. thus, provide the
evidence novel host protein binds hiv-1 facilitates viral
cdna synthesis subsequent steps precede integration vivo.
