rabies, oldest known infectious disease, remains serious threat to
public health worldwide. eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin tric/cct complex
facilitates folding proteins atp hydrolysis. here, investigated
the expression, cellular localization, function neuronal cctγ during
neurotropic rabies virus (rabv) infection using mouse n2a cells model.
following rabv infection, 24 altered proteins identified using
two-dimensional electrophoresis mass spectrometry, including 20 upregulated
proteins 4 downregulated proteins. mouse n2a cells infected rabv or
cotransfected rabv genes encoding nucleoprotein (n) phosphoprotein (p), 
confocal microscopy demonstrated upregulated cellular cctγ colocalized
with viral proteins n p, formed hollow cricoid inclusion within the
region around nucleus. inclusions, correspond negri bodies
(nbs), form mouse n2a cells expressing viral protein n p. 
knockdown cctγ lentivirus-mediated rna interference led significant
inhibition rabv replication. results demonstrate complex
consisting viral proteins n p recruits cctγ nbs identify the
chaperonin cctγ host factor facilitates intracellular rabv replication.
this work illustrates viruses utilize cellular chaperonins and
compartmentalization benefit.
