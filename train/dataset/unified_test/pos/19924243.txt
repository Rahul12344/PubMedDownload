background: entry enveloped viruses host cells requires activation of
viral envelope glycoproteins cleavage either intracellular or
extracellular proteases. order gain insight molecular basis of
protease cleavage impact efficiency viral entry, we
investigated susceptibility recombinant native full-length s-protein
trimer (trispike) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov)
to cleavage various airway proteases.
methodology/principal findings: purified trispike proteins readily cleaved
in vitro three different airway proteases: trypsin, plasmin tmprss11a.
high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) amino acid sequencing analyses 
identified two arginine residues (r667 r797) potential protease cleavage
site(s). effect protease-dependent enhancement sars-cov infection was
demonstrated ace2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16hbe. airway 
proteases regulate infectivity sars-cov fashion dependent previous
receptor binding. role arginine residues shown mutant
constructs (r667a, r797a r797ar667a). mutation r667 r797 affect 
the expression s-protein resulted differential efficacy of
pseudotyping sars-covpp. r667a sars-covpp mutant exhibited lack of
virus entry enhancement following protease treatment.
conclusions/significance: results suggest sars s-protein is
susceptible airway protease cleavage and, furthermore, protease mediated 
enhancement virus entry depends specific conformation sars s-protein
upon ace2 binding. data direct implications cell entry
mechanism sars-cov along respiratory system and, furthermore expand the
possibility identifying potential therapeutic agents sars-cov.
