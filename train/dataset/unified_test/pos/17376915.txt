influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 (ns1a protein) virulence factor
which targeted nucleus. multifunctional protein inhibits
host cell pre-mrna processing counteracts host cell antiviral responses. we
show ns1a protein interact six human importin alpha
isoforms, indicating nuclear translocation ns1a protein mediated
by classical importin alpha/beta pathway. ns1a protein h1n1
(wsn/33) virus one n-terminal arginine- lysine-rich nuclear
localization signal (nls1), whereas ns1a protein h3n2 subtype
(udorn/72) virus also second c-terminal nls (nls2). nls1 mapped to
residues 35 41, also function double-stranded rna-binding
activity ns1a protein. nls2 created 7-amino-acid c-terminal
extension (residues 231 237) became prevalent among human influenza a
virus types isolated years 1950 1987. nls2 includes basic amino
acids positions 219, 220, 224, 229, 231, 232. surprisingly, nls2 also
forms functional nucleolar localization signal nols, function was
retained h3n2 type virus ns1a proteins even without c-terminal extension. 
it likely evolutionarily well-conserved nucleolar targeting function 
of ns1a protein plays role pathogenesis influenza virus.
