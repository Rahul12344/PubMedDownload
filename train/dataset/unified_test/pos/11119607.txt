the epstein-barr virus (ebv) bamhi mrnas originally identified cdna
libraries nasopharyngeal carcinoma, expressed high levels.
the rnas differentially spliced form several open reading frames also 
contain barf0 open reading frame 3' end. one cdna, rk-barf0, included 
a potential endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal peptide sequence. rk-barf0
protein shown interact notch4 ligand binding domain, using
yeast two-hybrid screening, coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy. 
interaction induces translocation portion full-length unprocessed
notch4 nucleus using notch nuclear localization signal. these
effects rk-barf0 notch intracellular location indicate ebv possibly
modulates notch signaling. unprocessed notch4 also detected in
immunoprecipitated complexes ebv-infected cells using rabbit antiserum 
raised barf0-specific peptide. finding provides additional
evidence expression rk-barf0 interaction notch ebv
infection. ebv-infected, ebna2-negative cells, rk-barf0 induced expression
of ebv latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1), induction dependent 
rk-barf0/notch interaction domain. activation lmp1 expression rk-barf0 
may responsible expression lmp1 ebv latent infections absence
of ebna2.
