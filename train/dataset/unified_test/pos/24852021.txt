bca2 (rabring7, rnf115 znf364) ring-finger e3 ubiquitin ligase was
identified co-factor restriction imposed tetherin/bst2 hiv-1.
contrary current model, bca2 lacks antiviral activity the
absence tetherin, found bca2 possesses tetherin-independent antiviral 
activity. show n-terminus bca2 physically interacts 
matrix region hiv-1 retroviral gag proteins promotes their
ubiquitination, redistribution endo-lysosomal compartments and, ultimately,
lysosomal degradation. targeted depletion bca2 tetherin-expressing 
tetherin-deficient cells results significant increase virus release and
replication, indicating endogenous bca2 possesses antiviral activity.
therefore, results indicate bca2 functions antiviral factor that
targets hiv-1 gag degradation, impairing virus assembly release.
