background: human eed protein, member superfamily polycomb group 
(pcg) proteins wd-40 repeats, found interact three hiv-1
components, namely structural gag matrix protein (ma), integrase enzyme
(in) nef protein. aim present study analyze the
possible biological role eed hiv-1 replication, using hiv-1-based
vector hiv-luc eed protein expressed dna transfection 293t cells.
results: early phase hiv-1 infection, slight negative effect on
virus infectivity occurred eed-expressing cells, appeared be
dependent eed-ma interaction. late times post infection, eed caused an
important reduction virus production, 20- 25-fold determined by
cap24 immunoassay, 10- 80-fold based genomic rna levels, this
decrease due reduction gag protein synthesis. coexpression of
wtnef, non-n-myristoylated mutant nefg2a, restored virus yields levels 
obtained absence exogenous eed protein. effect observed
with mutant nefdelta57 mimicking nef core, lipid raft-retargeted 
fusion protein lat-nef. lataa-nef, mutant defective lipid raft
addressing function, anti-eed effect wtnef. cell fractionation
and confocal imaging showed that, absence nef, eed mainly localized 
membrane domains different lipid rafts. upon co-expression wtnef,
nefg2a lataa-nef, nefdelta57 lat-nef, eed found to
relocate insoluble fraction along nef protein. electron microscopy
of hiv-luc producer cells overexpressing eed showed significant less virus
budding cell surface compared control cells, ectopic assembly and
clustering nuclear pore complexes within cytoplasm.
conclusion: data suggested eed exerted antiviral activity late
stage hiv-1 replication, included genomic rna packaging virus
assembly, resulting possibly mistrafficking viral genomic rna (grna) or
grna/gag complex. nef reversed eed negative effect virus production, a
function required integrity nef n-terminal domain, its
n-myristoyl group. antagonistic effect nef correlated cellular
redistribution eed nef.
