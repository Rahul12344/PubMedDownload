phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pi4p) well known upregulated during
hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication. role pi4 kinases hcv been
extensively investigated. whether pi4p phosphatase sac1 altered hcv
remains unclear. here, identified arfgap1 novel host factor hcv
replication. show sac1 interacts arfgap1 inhibits hcv
replication. elevation pi4p induced hcv ns5a abrogated the
coatomer protein (copi) pathway inhibited. also found interaction
between ns5a arfgap1. furthermore, identified conserved cluster of
positively charged amino acids ns5a critical interaction ns5a 
arfgap1, induction pi4p, hcv replication. data demonstrate that
arfgap1 host factor hcv rna replication. arfgap1 hijacked hcv ns5a
to remove copi cargo sac1 site hcv replication maintain high
levels pi4p. findings provide additional mechanism hcv
enhances formation pi4p-rich environment.importance: pi4p enriched the
replication area hcv; however, whether pi4p phosphatase sac1 subverted by
hcv established. detailed mechanism copi contributes viral
replication remains unknown, though copi components hijacked hcv. we
demonstrate arfgap1 hijacked hcv ns5a remove copi cargo sac1 from
the hcv replication area maintain high-level pi4p generated ns5a.
furthermore, identify conserved cluster positively charged amino acids in
ns5a, critical interaction ns5a arfgap1, induction of
pi4p, hcv replication. study shed mechanistic insight 
rna viruses hijack copi sac1.
