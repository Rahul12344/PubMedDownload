the e6 oncoproteins high-risk human papillomaviruses provide important
functions malignant transformation also productive viral 
life cycle. e6 proteins shown bind number cellular factors, 
but limited number analyses investigated effects these
interactions viral life cycle. study, investigated the
consequences hpv 31 e6 binding e6tp1, putative rap1 gap protein. hpv 16
e6 shown bind well induce rapid turnover e6tp1, and
similar effects observed hpv 31 e6. mutation amino acid 128 hpv
31 e6 found abrogate ability bind degrade e6tp1 not
alter binding another alpha-helical domain protein, e6ap. hpv 31 genomes 
containing mutations amino acid 128 transfected human keratinocytes,
the viral dnas stably maintained episomes indicating importance
of residue pathogenesis. many e6 binding partners including e6tp1 are
cytoplasmic proteins, e6 also reported localized the
nucleus. therefore investigated importance e6 localization the
nucleus viral life cycle. using fusion e6 green fluorescent
protein, mapped one component nuclear localization sequences to
residues 121 124 hpv 31 e6. mutation residues context of
the hpv 31 genome abrogated ability episomes stably maintained 
impaired ability extend life span cells. studies identify two
activities hpv 31 e6 important function viral life
cycle extension cell life span.
