hepatitis c virus (hcv) remarkably efficient establishing persistent
infection, suggesting evolved one strategies aimed evading
the host immune response. cell responses, including interferon-gamma
production, severely suppressed chronic hcv patients. hcv core protein
has previously shown circulate bloodstream hcv-infected
patients inhibit host immunity interaction gc1qr. to
determine role hcv core-gc1qr interaction modulation of
inflammatory cytokine production, examined interleukin (il)-12 production,
which critical induction interferon-gamma synthesis, in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocyte/macrophages. found core
protein binds gc1qr displayed cell surface monocyte/macrophages and
inhibits production il-12p70 upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. this
inhibition found selective hcv core failed affect the
production il-6, il-8, il-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha. addition,
suppression il-12 production core protein occurred transcriptional
level inhibition il-12p40 mrna synthesis. importantly, core-induced
inhibition il-12p40 mrna synthesis resulted impaired activation ap-1
rather enhanced il-10 production. results suggest hcv
core-gc1qr interaction may play pivotal role establishing persistent
infection dampening th1 responses.
