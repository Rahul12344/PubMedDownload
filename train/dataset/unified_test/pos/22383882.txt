ebolaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever 90% lethality fatal cases,
are characterized early suppression host innate immune system. one of
the proteins likely responsible effect vp24. vp24 known to
antagonize interferon signaling binding host karyopherin Î± proteins, thereby
preventing transporting tyrosine-phosphorylated transcription
factor stat1 nucleus. here, report vp24 binds stat1 directly,
suggesting vp24 suppress least two distinct branches the
interferon pathway. here, also report first crystal structures vp24,
derived different species ebolavirus pathogenic (sudan) and
nonpathogenic humans (reston). structures reveal vp24 novel, 
pyramidal fold. site particular face pyramid exhibits reduced
solvent exchange complex stat1. site two highly
conserved pockets vp24 contain key residues previously implicated in
virulence. crystal structures accompanying biochemical analysis map
differences pathogenic nonpathogenic viruses, offer templates for
drug design, provide three-dimensional framework necessary biological
dissection many functions vp24 virus life cycle.
