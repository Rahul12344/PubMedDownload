coxsackievirus infection induces abnormal accumulation ubiquitin aggregates
that generally believed noxious cells key role in
viral pathogenesis. selective autophagy mediated autophagy adaptor proteins,
including sequestosome 1 (sqstm1/p62) neighbor brca1 gene 1 protein
(nbr1), important pathway disposing misfolded/ubiquitin conjugates.
we recently demonstrated sqstm1 cleaved coxsackievirus
infection, resulting disruption sqstm1 function selective autophagy.
nbr1 functional homolog sqstm1. study, propose test whether
nbr1 compensate compromise sqstm1 viral infection. of
interest, found nbr1 also cleaved coxsackievirus infection.
this cleavage took place two sites mediated virus-encoded protease 2a(pro) 
and 3c(pro), respectively. addition loss-of-function, further
investigated whether cleavage sqstm1/nbr1 leads generation toxic
gain-of-function mutants. showed c-terminal fragments sqstm1 and
nbr1 exhibited dominant-negative effect native sqstm1/nbr1, probably by
competing lc3 ubiquitin chain binding. finally, demonstrated a
positive, mutual regulatory relationship sqstm1 nbr1 viral
infection. showed knockdown sqstm1 resulted reduced expression of
nbr1, whereas overexpression sqstm1 led increased level nbr1, vice
versa, excluding possible compensation nbr1 loss of
sqstm1. taken together, findings study suggest novel mechanism
through coxsackievirus infection induces increased accumulation of
ubiquitin conjugates subsequent viral damage.
