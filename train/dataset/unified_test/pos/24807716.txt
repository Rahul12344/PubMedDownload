nuclear factor κb (nf-κb) plays important roles innate immune responses by
regulating expression large number target genes involved the
immune inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation,
and survival. survive host cells, viruses evolved multiple
strategies evade subvert host immune response. herpes simplex virus 1 
(hsv-1) bears large dna genome, capacity encode many different
viral proteins counteract host immune responses. present study, 
demonstrated hsv-1 protein kinase us3 significantly inhibited nf-κb
activation decreased expression inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8
(il-8). us3 also shown hyperphosphorylate p65 serine 75 block its
nuclear translocation. two us3 mutants, k220m d305a, still interacted with
p65; however, could hyperphosphorylate p65, indicating kinase
activity us3 indispensable function. attenuation nf-κb
activation hsv-1 us3 protein kinase may represent critical adaptation to
enable virus persistence within host. importance: study demonstrated
that hsv-1 protein kinase us3 significantly inhibited nf-κb activation and
decreased expression inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8). us3
hyperphosphorylated p65 serine 75 inhibit nf-κb activation. kinase
activity us3 indispensable hyperphosphorylation p65 and
abrogation nuclear translocation p65. present study elaborated a
novel mechanism hsv-1 us3 evade host innate immunity.
