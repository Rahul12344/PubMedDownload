we investigated ability hiv-1 protease cleave human complement
proteins classical complement pathway: c1q, c2 c4 well the
regulatory protein, c1-inhibitor. purified complement proteins incubated
with recombinant hiv-1 protease vitro analyzed sds-page and
immunoblotting assay. cleavage site found n-terminal region of
c1-inhibitor, located residues leu-32 phe-33 determined
by amino acid sequence analysis 85 kda proteolytic fragment 12 edman
degradation cycles. hiv-1 protease cleavage sites found c1q, c2
and c4 protein. hiv-1 protease-susceptible site n-terminal region of
c1-inhibitor close cleavage sites proteases are
able induce n-terminal proteolysis protein.
