orf virus (orfv) zoonotic parapoxvirus induces acute pustular skin
lesions sheep humans. orfv reinfect host discovery of
several secreted immune modulatory factors include chemokine-binding
protein (cbp) may explain phenomenon. dendritic cells (dc) professional 
antigen presenting cells induce adaptive immunity recruitment to
sites infection skin migration peripheral lymph nodes critically 
dependent inflammatory constitutive chemokine gradients respectively. here
we examined whether orfv-cbp could disable gradients using mouse models.
previously established orfv-cbp bound murine inflammatory chemokines with
high affinity show binding spectrum extends constitutive
chemokines ccl19 ccl21. using cell-based chemotaxis assays, orfv-cbp
inhibited movement immature mature dc response these
inflammatory constitutive chemokines respectively. moreover c57bl/6 mice, 
intradermally injected cbp potently inhibited recruitment blood-derived dc
to lipopolysaccharide-induced sites skin inflammation inhibited the
migration ex vivo cpg-activated dc inguinal lymph nodes. finally showed 
that orfv-cbp completely inhibited responsiveness inguinal lymph nodes
using intradermally injected dc pulsed ovalbumin peptide transfused
transgenic cells.
