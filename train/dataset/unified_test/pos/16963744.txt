bhrf1, early gene product epstein-barr virus (ebv), structurally and
functionally homologous bcl-2, cellular anti-apoptotic protein. bhrf1 has
been shown protect cells apoptosis induced numerous external stimuli. 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma epithelial cancer associated closely ebv
infection. specific proteins might interact modulate bhrf1
anti-apoptotic activity normal epithelial cells interest. therefore, 
cdna library derived normal human foreskin keratinocytes screened the
yeast two-hybrid system cellular gene encoding human vaccinia virus b1r
kinase-related kinase 2 (vrk2) isolated. interaction cellular
vrk2 viral bhrf1 proteins demonstrated glutathione
s-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser-scanning microscopy and
co-immunoprecipitation. analyses vrk2-deletion mutants revealed 108 aa 
fragment c terminus important vrk2 interact bhrf1. for
bhrf1, aa 1-18 89-142 crucial interacting vrk2 two
regions counterparts bcl-2 homology domains 4 1. overexpressed vrk2
alone showed modest effect anti-apoptosis appeared enhance cell
survival presence bhrf1. however, enhancement observed
when vrk2 co-expressed bcl-2. results indicate human vrk2
interacts specifically ebv bhrf1 interaction involved in
protecting cells apoptosis.
