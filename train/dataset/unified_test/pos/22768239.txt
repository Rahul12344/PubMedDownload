the interaction viral proteins host-cellular proteins elicits the
activation cellular signal transduction pathways possibly leads viral
pathogenesis well cellular biological events. apoptotic signals induced 
dna-damage remarkably up-regulated friend leukemia virus (flv) exclusively
in c3h hosts; however, mechanisms underlying apoptosis enhancement and
host-specificity unknown. here, show c3h mouse-derived hematopoietic 
cells originally express higher levels minichromosome maintenance (mcm) 2 
protein balb/c- c57bl/6-deriverd cells, undergo frequent
apoptosis following doxorubicin-induced dna-damage presence flv
envelope protein gp70. dual transfection gp70/mcm2 reproduced
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis even balb/c-derived 3t3 cells.
immunoprecipitation assays using various deletion mutants mcm2 revealed that
gp70 bound nuclear localization signal (nls) 1 (amino acids 18-24) of
mcm2, interfered function nls2 (amino acids 132-152), suppressed 
the normal nuclear-import mcm2. cytoplasmic mcm2 reduced activity of
protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) leading subsequent hyperphosphorylation of
dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk). phosphorylated dna-pk exhibited elevated
kinase activity phosphorylate p53, thereby up-regulating p53-dependent
apoptosis. apoptosis-enhancing domain identified c-terminal portion
(amino acids 703-904) mcm2. furthermore, simultaneous treatment flv and
doxorubicin extended survival scid mice bearing 8047 leukemia cells
expressing high levels mcm2. thus, depending subcellular localization, 
mcm2 plays different roles. participates dna replication nucleus 
shown previously, enhances apoptosis cytoplasm.
