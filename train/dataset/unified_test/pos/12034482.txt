cellular 'defense collagens' produced launch virus-specific responses to
clear invading viruses. cellular p32, c1q binding protein one such
protein. report, identified interaction p32 derived a
human lung diploid cell line (wi-38) rubella virus capsid (rvcp therien
strain) n-terminal 28-amino acid domain, conserved among several rv
strains including vaccine strains. identified c-terminal 
69 aa mature p32 sufficient interact cp. addition, we
observed three independent vero 76-derived cell lines constitutively
overexpressing p32, rv infectivity enhanced. results suggest rv 
has evolved strategy whereby one proteins recruited interact with,
and exploit cellular defense machinery advantage.
