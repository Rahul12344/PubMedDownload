ikaros zinc finger dna-binding protein regulates chromatin remodeling
and expression genes involved cell cycle, apoptosis, notch
signaling. master regulator lymphocyte differentiation functions
as tumor suppressor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. nevertheless, previous 
reports described effects ikaros life cycle human lymphotropic
virus. here, demonstrate full-length ikaros (ik-1) functions major
factor maintenance viral latency epstein-barr virus (ebv)-positive
burkitt's lymphoma sal mutui cell lines. either silencing ikaros
expression small hairpin rna (shrna) knockdown ectopic expression a
non-dna-binding isoform induced lytic gene expression. effects synergized
with lytic inducers ebv, including transforming growth factor β (tgf-β) 
and hypoxia mimic desferrioxamine. data chromatin immunoprecipitation
(chip)-quantitative pcr (qpcr) chip-sequencing (chip-seq) analyses indicated 
that ikaros bind either ebv immediate early genes bzlf1 and
brlf1. rather, ikaros affected expression oct-2 bcl-6, other
transcription factors directly inhibit ebv reactivation plasma cell
differentiation, respectively. ik-1 also complexed ebv immediate early r
protein coimmunoprecipitation assays partially colocalized r within
cells. presence r alleviated ik-1-mediated transcriptional repression,
with ik-1 cooperating z r enhance lytic gene expression. thus,
we conclude ikaros plays distinct roles different stages ebv's life
cycle: contributes maintaining latency via indirect mechanisms, may 
also synergize z r enhance lytic replication direct
association r and/or r-induced alterations ikaros' functional activities 
via cellular signaling pathways.importance: first report showing that
the cellular protein ikaros, known master regulator hematopoiesis and
critical tumor suppressor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also plays important
roles life cycle epstein-barr virus b cells.
