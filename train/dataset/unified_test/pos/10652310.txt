a 193-kda sv40 large antigen (t-ag)-binding protein, designated p193, was
identified cloned. inspection deduced amino acid sequence revealed the
presence short motif similar bcl-2 homology (bh) domain 3, suggesting
that p193 may member family apoptosis promoting proteins containing 
only bh3 motifs. support this, p193 expression promoted apoptosis in
nih-3t3 cells. deletion bh3 motif abolished p193 apoptosis activity.
p193-induced apoptosis antagonized co-expression bcl-x(l). immune
cytologic analysis indicated p193 localized cytoplasm of
transfected cells. p193-induced apoptosis also antagonized co-expression
of t-ag, resulted cytoplasmic localization proteins. the
p193 binding site mapped n-terminal region t-ag previously
implicated transforming activity. results suggest t-ag possesses an
antiapoptosis activity, independent p53 sequestration, actuated by
t-ag/p193 binding cytoplasm.
