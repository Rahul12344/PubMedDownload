the interferon-inducible protein tetratricopeptide (ifit) family proteins
inhibit replication viruses recognizing several types rnas,
including 5'-triphosphate rna 5' capped 2'-o unmethylated mrna. however, it
remains unclear ifits inhibit replication viruses recognition
of rna. here, analyzed mechanisms ifit1 exerts antiviral
responses. replication japanese encephalitis virus (jev) 2'-o
methyltransferase (mtase) mutant markedly enhanced mouse embryonic
fibroblasts macrophages lacking ifit1. ifit1 bound 5'-triphosphate rna but
more preferentially associated 5' capped 2'-o unmethylated mrna. ifit1
inhibited translation mrna thereby restricted replication jev
mutated 2'-o mtase. thus, ifit1 inhibits replication mtase-defective jev by
inhibiting mrna translation direct binding mrna 5' structures.
