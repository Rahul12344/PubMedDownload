promoter-specific differences function transcription factors play a
central role regulation gene expression. measured maximal
transcriptional activation potentials nuclear factor (nfi) proteins encoded 
by four identified nfi genes (nfi-a, -b, -c, -x) transient
transfection jeg-3 cells using two model nfi-dependent promoters: 1) simple 
chimeric promoter containing single nfi-binding site upstream adenovirus
major late promoter (nfi-ad), 2) complex mouse mammary tumor virus
long terminal repeat promoter. relative activation potentials nfi
isoforms differed two promoters, nfi-x strongest
activator nfi-ad nfi-b strongest activator mmtv promoter.
to determine promoter-specific differences activation potential 
due presence glucocorticoid response elements (gres), added gres
upstream nfi-binding site nfi-ad. nfi-x remains strongest activator
of gre containing simple promoter, indicating differences relative
activation potential due solely presence gres. since nfi
proteins bind dna dimers, assessed activation potentials nfi
heterodimers. here, show nfi heterodimers intermediate activation
potentials compared homodimers, demonstrating one potential mechanism by
which different nfi proteins regulate gene expression.
