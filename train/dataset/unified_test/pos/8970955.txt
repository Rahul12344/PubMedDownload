a panel primary syncytium-inducing (si) human immunodeficiency virus type 1
isolates infected several cd4+ t-cell lines, including mt-2 c8166, 
tested infection blood-derived macrophages. infectivity titers c8166
cells macrophages demonstrated primary si strains infected macrophages
much efficiently t-cell line-adapted hiv-1 strains lai rf. 
these primary si strains therefore dual-tropic. nine biological clones of
two si strains, prepared limiting dilution, macrophage/c8166 infectivity
ratios similar parental viruses, indicating the
dual-tropic phenotype due mixture non-si/macrophage-tropic and
si/t-cell tropic viruses. tested whether primary si strains used either
lestr (fusin) ccr5 coreceptors. infection cat ccc/cd4 cells transiently 
expressing lestr supported infection t-cell line-adapted strains including
lai, whereas ccc/cd4 cells expressing ccr5 sensitive primary non-si
strains well molecularly cloned strains sf-162 jr-csf. several
primary si strains, well molecularly cloned dual-tropic viruses 89.6
and gun-1, infected lestr+ ccr5+ ccc/cd4 cells. thus, viruses 
choose lestr ccr5 entry cells. interestingly, some
dual-tropic primary si strains infected lestr+ cells failed infect ccr5+ 
cells, suggesting viruses may use alternative coreceptor for
infection macrophages. alternatively, ccr5 may processed presented
differently cat cells entry primary si strains others 
is affected.
