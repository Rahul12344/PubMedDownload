during viral infection, extracellular dsrna potent signaling molecule that
activates many innate immune cells, including macrophages. tlr3 well-known
receptor extracellular dsrna, internalization extracellular dsrna is
required endosomal tlr3 activation. preserved inflammatory responses of
tlr3-deficient macrophages extracellular dsrna strongly support a
tlr3-independent mechanism dsrna-mediated immune responses. present study 
demonstrated cd11b/cd18 (mac-1 [macrophage-1 ag]), surface integrin
receptor, recognized extracellular dsrna induced macrophage immune responses.
cd11b deficiency reduced inflammatory cytokine induction elicited by
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly i:c; synthetic dsrna) mouse sera and
livers, well cultured peritoneal macrophages. dsrna-binding assay and
confocal immunofluorescence showed mac-1, especially cd11b subunit,
interacted colocalized poly i:c surface macrophages. further
mechanistic studies revealed two distinct signaling events following dsrna
recognition mac-1. first, mac-1 facilitated poly i:c internalization through
the activation pi3k signaling enhanced tlr3-dependent activation irf3
in macrophages. second, poly i:c induced activation phagocyte nadph oxidase in
a tlr3-independent, mac-1-dependent, manner. subsequently, phagocyte nadph
oxidase-derived intracellular reactive oxygen species activated mapk nf-Îºb
pathways. results indicate extracellular dsrna activates mac-1 to
enhance tlr3-dependent signaling trigger tlr3-independent, but
mac-1-dependent, inflammatory oxidative signaling, identifying novel
mechanistic basis macrophages recognize extracellular dsrna regulate
innate immune responses. study identifies mac-1 novel surface receptor 
for extracellular dsrna implicates potential therapeutic target for
virus-related inflammatory diseases.
