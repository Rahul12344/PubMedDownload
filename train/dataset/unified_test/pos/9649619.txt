eosinophil cationic protein (ecp) one two rnase a-superfamily ribonucleases
found secretory granules human eosinophilic leukocytes. although the
physiologic function eosinophils [and thus two eosinophil
ribonucleases, ecp eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn)] remains
controversial, recently shown isolated human eosinophils promote
ribonuclease-dependent toxicity toward extracellular virions the
single-stranded rna virus, respiratory syncytial virus, group b (rsv-b). 
also shown recombinant human edn (rhedn) act alone a
ribonuclease-dependent antiviral agent. work, provide biochemical
characterization recombinant human ecp (rhecp) prepared baculovirus, and
demonstrate rhecp also promotes ribonuclease-dependent antiviral activity.
the rhecp described n-glycosylated, native ecp, has
approximately 100-fold ribonuclease activity non-glycosylated rhecp
prepared bacteria. enzymatic activity rhecp sensitive inhibition
by placental ribonuclease inhibitor (ri). although rhecp effective 
rhedn reducing viral infectivity (500 nm rhecp reduced infectivity rsv-b
approximately 6 fold; 500 nm rhedn, >50 fold), antiviral activity appears 
be unique eosinophil ribonucleases; reduction infectivity was
promoted bovine rnase a, amphibian ribonuclease, onconase, the
closely-related human ribonuclease, rnase k6. interestingly, combinations of
rhedn rhecp result either synergistic even additive
antiviral effect. taken together, results suggest interaction
between eosinophil ribonucleases extracellular virions rsv-b may
be specific saturable.
