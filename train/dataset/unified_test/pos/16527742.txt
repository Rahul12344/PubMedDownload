apobec3 proteins constitute family cytidine deaminases provide
intracellular resistance retrovirus replication transposition of
endogenous retroelements. one family member, apobec3a (ha3a), orphan,
without known antiviral activity. show ha3a catalytically active
and it, none family members, potently inhibits replication 
of parvovirus adeno-associated virus (aav). ha3a also potent inhibitor 
of endogenous ltr retroelements, musd, iap, non-ltr retroelement,
line-1. function dependent conserved amino acids ha3a
active site, consistent role cytidine deamination, although mutations 
in retroelement sequences found. findings demonstrate potent
activity ha3a, apobec3 family member previously identified
function. also highlight functional differences apobec3
proteins. apobec3 family members distinct functions may evolved
to resist various classes genetic elements.
