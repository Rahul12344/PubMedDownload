influenza virus important human pathogen accounting widespread
morbidity mortality, new strains emerging animal reservoirs
possessing potential cause pandemics. influenza rna-dependent rna
polymerase complex consists three subunits (pa, pb1, pb2) catalyzes
viral rna replication transcription activities nuclei infected host
cells. pb2 subunit implicated pathogenicity host adaptation. 
this includes inhibition type interferon induction interaction
with host's mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (mavs), adaptor
molecule rig-i-like helicases. study reports identification the
cognate pb2 mavs interaction domains necessary complex formation.
specifically, mavs residues 1-150, containing card domain the
n-terminal portion proline rich-region, pb2 residues 1-37 are
essential pb2-mavs virus-host protein-protein complex formation. three
α-helices constituting pb2 (1-37) tested determine relative
influence complex formation, helix3 observed promote primary
interaction mavs. pb2 mavs-binding domain unexpectedly coincided with
its pb1-binding domain, indicating important dual functionality this
region pb2. analysis interaction domains suggests virus host
properties may contribute host tropism. additionally, results this
study suggest new strategy develop influenza therapeutics by
simultaneously blocking pb2-mavs pb2-pb1 protein-protein interactions and
their resulting activities.
