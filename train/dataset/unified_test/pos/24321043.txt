the human retrovirus human cell lymphotropic virus type-i (htlv-1) the
etiologic agent htlv-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis
(ham/tsp). axonal degeneration ham/tsp patients occurs without neuron
infection, secreted viral tax protein proposed involved. we
previously found tax secreted culture medium mt-2 cells
(htlv-1-infected cell line) produced neurite retraction neuroblastoma cells
differentiated neuronal type. assess relevance tax posttranslational
modifications effect, addressed question whether tax secreted
by mt-2 cells peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) htlv-1-infected
subjects modified. interaction tax calreticulin (crt) that
modulates intracellular tax localization secretion described. we
studied tax localization modifications mt-2 cells interaction with
crt. intracellular tax mt-2 cells assessed flow cytometry,
corresponding mainly 71-kda protein followed western blot. protein
reported chimera gp21 viral protein-confirmed mass
spectrometry-showed ubiquitination sumoylation. tax-crt interaction was
determined confocal microscopy coimmunoprecipitation. extracellular tax
from ham/tsp pbmcs ubiquitinated according western blot, its
interaction crt shown coimmunoprecipitation. positive correlation
between tax crt secretion observed ham/tsp pbmcs asymptomatic
carriers. proteins inhibitors activators secretion showed
secretion endoplasmic reticulum-golgi complex. tax, present pbmc
culture medium, produced neurite retraction differentiated neuroblastoma
cells. results suggest tax, whether ubiquitinated not, active
for neurite retraction.
