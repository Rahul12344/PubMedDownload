human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)-encoded g protein-coupled-receptor us28 believed 
to participate virus dissemination modulation cell migration and
immune evasion. us28 binds different cc chemokines cx3c chemokine cx3cl1.
membrane-anchored cx3cl1 expressed immune-activated endothelial cells,
causing redirection cx3cr1-expressing leukocytes blood sites of
infection. here, used stable transfected cell lines examine us28
expression affects cell migration immobilized full-length cx3cl1, model how
hcmv-infected leukocytes interact inflamed endothelium. observed that
us28-expressing cells migrated cx3cr1-expressing cells adhering to
immobilized cx3cl1. us28-induced migration g protein-signalling dependent and
was blocked phospholipase cβ inhibitor u73122 intracellular
calcium chelator bapta-am. addition, migration inhibited a
dose-dependent manner competition ccl2 ccl5, whereas ccl3 little 
effect. instead migrating, cx3cr1-expressing cells performed
'dancing-on-the-spot' movements, demonstrating anchored cx3cl1 acts a
strong tether cells. low receptor expression levels, however, no
significant difference migration potential observed comparing the
migration cx3cr1- us28-expressing cells. thus, data showed that, 
contrast cx3cr1, promotes efficient cell capture upon binding to
anchored cx3cl1, us28 acts increase migration cells upon binding the
same ligand. overall, indicates infected cells probably move 
uninfected cells inflamed tissues high cx3cl1 expression, soluble
chemokines affecting final migration.
