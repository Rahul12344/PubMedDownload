by dissecting reconstituting cell-free influenza virus genome replication
system, purified identified minichromosome maintenance (mcm)
complex, thought dna replicative helicase, one host
factors regulate virus genome replication. mcm interacted pa
subunit viral rna-dependent rna polymerase found involved in
the replication genetically. virus genome replication decreased mcm2
knockdown cells. viral polymerase appeared nonproductive complex,
that is, capable initiating replication produced abortive
short rna chains. mcm stimulated de novo-initiated replication reaction by
stabilizing replication complex transition initiation to
elongation. based findings, including result mcm-mediated rna
replication reaction competed exogenously added rna, propose mcm
functions scaffold nascent rna chains viral polymerase.
