serine protease inhibitor elafin (e) precursor, trappin-2 (tr), been
associated mucosal resistance hiv-1 infection. recently showed that
tr/e among principal anti-hiv-1 molecules cervicovaginal lavage (cvl)
fluid, e ∼130 times potent tr hiv-1, tr/e
inhibited hiv-1 attachment transcytosis across human genital epithelial cells
(ecs). since herpes simplex virus 2 (hsv-2) major sexually transmitted
infection risk factor hiv-1 infection transmission, assessed tr/e 
contribution defense hsv-2. vitro studies demonstrated that
pretreatment endometrial (hec-1a) endocervical (end1/e6e7) ecs human 
tr-expressing adenovirus (ad/tr) recombinant tr/e proteins after
hsv-2 infection resulted significantly reduced virus titers compared 
of controls. interestingly, e ∼7 times potent hsv-2 infection
than tr. conversely, knockdown endogenous tr/e small interfering rna
(sirna) significantly increased hsv-2 replication genital ecs. recombinant tr 
and e reduced viral attachment genital ecs acting indirectly cells.
further, lower viral replication associated reduced secretion of
proinflammatory interleukin 8 (il-8) tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) 
decreased nf-κb nuclear translocation. additionally, protected ad/tr-treated ecs 
demonstrated enhanced interferon regulatory factor 3 (irf3) nuclear translocation
and increased antiviral ifn-β response hsv-2. lastly, vivo studies of
intravaginal hsv-2 infection tr-transgenic mice (etg) showed despite
similar virus replication genital tract, etg mice reduced viral load
and tnf-α central nervous system compared controls. collectively, 
is first experimental evidence highlighting anti-hsv-2 activity tr/e in
female genital mucosa.
