several reports literature indicated e6 elevates
the level c-myc level protein also associates myc
complex activates myc-responsive genes. would seem mechanism by
which oncogene modulate cell proliferation differentiation.
furthermore, increase c-myc levels also observed ectopic
expression hpv e7 alone. using yeast two-hybrid system, found
that c-myc interacts forms specific complex hpv-16e7. this
study, demonstrated e7 indeed interact c-myc a
sequential deletion analysis e7 maps c-myc interaction site the
carboxyl-terminal region. determined two hpv-18 e7 binding sites c-myc
involving amino acids regions 1-100 367-439. interaction the
high-risk type hpv e7 c-myc augment c-myc transactivation activity but
this occur low-risk type hpv e7. deletion within cys-x-x-cys
repeat motif c-terminus hpv-18 e7 leads lost association with
c-myc also abolishes enhancement c-myc's transactivation activity.
furthermore, interaction hpv-18 e7 c-myc functionally promotes
c-myc's dna-binding ability. using htert promoter model, enhanced c-myc 
binding ability htert promoter measured immunoprecipitation assay
was observed occurred e7 dose-dependent manner. taken together, these
results provide significant new insights association c-myc e7
and possible involvement high-risk e7 oncogenesis.
