heart failure children adults often consequence myocarditis
associated coxsackievirus (cv) infection. upon cv infection, enteroviral
protease 2a cleaves small number host proteins including dystrophin, which
links actin filaments plasma membrane muscle fiber cells (sarcolemma). 
it unknown whether protease 2a-mediated cleavage dystrophin subsequent 
disruption sarcolemma play role cv-mediated myocarditis. generated
knockin mice harboring mutation protease 2a cleavage site the
dystrophin gene, prevents dystrophin cleavage following cv infection.
compared wild-type mice, found mice expressing cleavage-resistant
dystrophin decrease sarcolemmal disruption cardiac virus titer
following cv infection. addition, cleavage-resistant dystrophin inhibited 
cardiomyopathy induced cardiomyocyte-restricted expression cv protease 
2a transgene. findings indicate protease 2a-mediated cleavage of
dystrophin critical viral propagation, enteroviral-mediated cytopathic
effects, development cardiomyopathy.
