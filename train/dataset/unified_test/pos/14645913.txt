yaba-like disease virus (yldv) genes 7l 145r located opposite ends 
the genome predicted encode 7-transmembrane proteins (7-tm) share
53 44 % amino acid identity, respectively, human cc chemokine receptor 8
(hccr8). report, demonstrate early infection yldv,
cells acquire ability bind human ccl1. expression genes 7l 145r 
in vaccinia virus, demonstrated protein glycosylated is
exposed cell surface n terminus outside cell. protein 7l, but
not 145r, able bind hccl1 (k(d)=0.6+/-0.13 nm) couple heterotrimeric
g-proteins activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk1/2).
7l binds several chemokines including viral chemokines vmipi vmipii and
hccl7/mcp3. binding seems species-specific 7l bind murine
orthologues ccl1 ccl7 assays used. represents first
example poxviral 7-tm chemokine receptor functional interactions
with human chemokine.
