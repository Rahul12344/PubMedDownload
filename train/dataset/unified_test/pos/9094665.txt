the herpes simplex virus vp16 protein functions potent transcriptional
activator targets dna sites consensus taatgarat present the
viral immediate-early gene promoters. so, vp16 directs assembly a
multiprotein complex involving two cellular proteins, host cell factor (hcf) 
the oct-1 dna-binding transcription factor. investigate importance of
specific protein-protein interactions formation vp16-induced complex
(vic), used oligopeptides prevent vic assembly. linear cyclic peptides 
corresponding region vp16 previously implicated complex formation were
potent inhibitors vic assembly. characterize protein
interactions involved, cloned human cdna encoding minimal vp16
interaction domain hcf, containing amino acids 1 380 [hcf (1-380)]. the
rehays-based peptides active preventing vic assembly found to
specifically block binding vp16 hcf (1-380), without affecting vp16-oct-1
binding. inhibitory activity vp16 peptides strictly sequence
specific ehay residues. site-directed mutagenesis hcf (1-380)
domain revealed residues e102 k105 critical determinants support 
vic formation. alteration single residue hcf, k105, shown to
virtually abolish complex assembly. interestingly however, none hcf
mutants impaired ability support complex formation
exhibited defects direct vp16 binding, supporting loss function higher
order complex assembly.
