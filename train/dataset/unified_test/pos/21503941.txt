hepatitis b virus (hbv) small dna virus requires cellular transcription
factors expression genes. understand molecular mechanisms
that regulate hbv gene expression, conducted yeast one-hybrid screen to
identify novel cellular transcription factors may control hbv gene
expression. here, demonstrate krüppel-like factor 15 (klf15), a
liver-enriched transcription factor, robustly activate hbv surface core
promoters. mutations putative klf15 binding site hbv core promoter 
abolished ability klf15 activate core promoter luciferase
assays. furthermore, overexpression klf15 stimulated expression hbv
surface antigen (hbsag) core protein enhanced viral replication.
conversely, small interfering rna knockdown endogenous klf15 huh7 cells
resulted reduction hbv surface- core-promoter activities. in
electrophoretic mobility shift chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, klf15
binds dna probes derived core promoter surface promoter.
introduction expression vector klf15 short hairpin rna, together with
the hbv genome mouse liver using hydrodynamic injection, resulted a
significant reduction viral gene expression dna replication. additionally,
mutations klf15 response element hbv core promoter significantly
reduced viral dna levels mouse serum.conclusion: klf15 novel
transcriptional activator hbv core surface promoters. possible that
klf15 may serve potential therapeutic target reduce hbv gene expression
and viral replication.
