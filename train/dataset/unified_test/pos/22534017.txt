background: hiv-1 nef protein contributes pathogenesis via multiple functions 
that include enhancement viral replication infectivity, alteration of
intracellular trafficking, modulation cellular signaling pathways. nef
stimulates formation tunneling nanotubes virological synapses, is
transferred bystander cells via intercellular contacts secreted
microvesicles. nef associates activates pak2, kinase regulates
t-cell signaling actin cytoskeleton dynamics, nef promotes nanotube
formation unknown.
results: identify nef binding partners involved pak2-association dependent 
nef functions, employed tandem mass spectrometry analysis nef
immunocomplexes jurkat cells expressing wild-type nef nef mutants
defective ability associate pak2 (f85l, f89h, h191f a72p,
a75p nl4-3). report wild-type, mutant nef, associated with
5 components exocyst complex (exoc1, exoc2, exoc3, exoc4, exoc6), an
octameric complex tethers vesicles plasma membrane, regulates
polarized exocytosis, recruits membranes proteins required nanotube
formation. additionally, pak2 kinase associated exclusively wild-type
nef. association exoc1, exoc2, exoc3, exoc4 wild-type, mutant
nef, verified co-immunoprecipitation assays jurkat cells. furthermore, 
shrna-mediated depletion exoc2 jurkat cells abrogated nef-mediated
enhancement nanotube formation. using bioinformatic tools, visualized
protein interaction networks reveal functional linkages nef, the
exocyst complex, cellular endocytic exocytic trafficking machinery.
conclusions: exocyst complex proteins likely key effector nef-mediated
enhancement nanotube formation, possibly microvesicle secretion. linkages 
revealed nef exocyst complex suggest new paradigm exocyst
involvement polarized targeting intercellular transfer viral proteins
and viruses.
