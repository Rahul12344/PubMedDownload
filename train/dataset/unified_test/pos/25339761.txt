hepatitis c virus (hcv) glycoprotein e2 considered major target for
generating neutralizing antibodies hcv, primarily due role of
engaging host entry factors, cd81, key cell surface protein associated 
with hcv entry. based series biochemical analyses combination with
molecular docking, present description potential binding interface
formed e2 protein cd81. virus side interface includes
a hydrophobic helix motif comprised residues w(437)laglf(442), which
encompasses binding site neutralizing monoclonal antibody, mab41. the
helical conformation motif provides structural framework the
positioning residues f442 y443, serving contact points the
interaction cd81. cell side interface likewise involves a
surface-exposed hydrophobic helix, namely, d-helix cd81, coincides
with binding site 1d6, monoclonal anti-cd81 antibody known block hcv 
entry. illustration virus-host interface suggests important role
played w(437)laglf(442) helix e2 protein hydrophobic
interaction d-helix cd81, thereby facilitating understanding of
the mechanism antibody-mediated neutralization hcv.importance:
characterization interface established virus host cells 
provide important information may used control virus
infections. interface enables hepatitis c virus (hcv) infect human
liver cells well understood number cell surface
proteins, factors, conditions found associated infection
process. based series biochemical analyses combination molecular 
docking, present interface, consisting two hydrophobic helical
structures, hcv e2 surface glycoprotein cd81 protein, major
host cell receptor recognized hcv strains. study reveals critical 
role played hydrophobic interactions formation virus-host
interface, thereby contributing understanding mechanism for
antibody-mediated neutralization hcv.
