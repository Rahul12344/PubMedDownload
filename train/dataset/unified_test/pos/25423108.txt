nef hiv-1 accessory protein promotes viral replication and
pathogenesis. key function nef ensure sustained depletion cd4 and
mhc-i molecules infected cells inducing targeting proteins to
multivesicular bodies (mvbs), ultimately lysosomes degradation. nef
also affects cellular secretory routes promoting secretion via exosomes. 
to better understand effects nef exocytic pathway, investigated 
whether viral factor modifies composition exosomes released t
lymphocytes. showed cd4 mhc-i molecules secreted exosomes
from cells expression nef reduces amount proteins 
in exosomes. investigate functional role novel activity nef,
we performed vitro hiv-1 infection assays presence distinct
populations exosomes. demonstrated exosomes released cd4+ cells, 
but cd4- cells, efficiently inhibit hiv-1 infection vitro. cd4
is main receptor hiv-1 infection, results suggest cd4
molecules displayed surface exosomes bind envelope proteins of
hiv-1 hindering virus interaction target cells infection. importantly,
cd4-depleted exosomes released cd4+ cells expressing nef reduced
capacity inhibit hiv-1 infection vitro. results provide evidence that
nef promotes hiv-1 infection reducing expression cd4 exosomes from
infected cells, besides original role nef reducing cd4 levels at
the cell surface.
