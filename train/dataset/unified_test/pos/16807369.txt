tat, hiv transactivating protein, matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a
family extracellular matrix (ecm) endopeptidases, implicated 
pathogenesis hiv-associated dementia. however, possibility mmps
interact viral proteins remained unexplored. therefore treated mixed 
human fetal neuronal cultures recombinant tat select mmps. neurotoxicity
was determined measuring mitochondrial membrane potential neuronal cell
death. previous studies shown tat mmp independently cause
neurotoxicity. surprisingly, found combination tat mmp produced
significant attenuation neurotoxicity. determine whether a
physical interaction tat mmp, used protein electrophoresis and
western blot techniques, found mmp-1 degrade tat. effect was
blocked mmp inhibitors. furthermore, mmp-1 decreased tat-mediated
transactivation hiv long terminal repeat region, functionality
was restored mmp-1 activity inhibited. results suggest the
decrease tat-induced neurotoxicity hiv transactivation due tat's
enzymatic cleavage mmp-1. direct interaction human mmps viral
proteins demonstrated, resultant modulation tat-mediated
neurotoxicity transactivation. study elucidates unique viral-host
interaction may serve innate host defense mechanism.
