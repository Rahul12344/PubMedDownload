our studies aim elucidate functions carried long, in
its length highly conserved, c-terminal cytoplasmic domain (env-ct) hiv-1 
glycoprotein. mass spectrometric analysis cellular proteins bound tagged 
version hiv env-ct led identification prohibitin 1 2
proteins (phb1 phb2). ubiquitously expressed proteins, exist as
stable heterodimers, shown multiple functions within cells 
to localize multiple cellular extracellular compartments. specificity 
of binding phb1/phb2 complex env-ct confirmed various
manners, including coimmunoprecipitation authentic provirally encoded,
full-length env. strong binding dependent env residues 790 800 and
could severely inhibited double mutation l799r/l800q by
mutation amino acids individually. analysis respective mutant
virions revealed different abilities bind phb1/phb2 correlated with
their replicative properties. thus, mutated virions single mutations
[hiv-env-(l799r) hiv-env-(l800q)] replicated similarly wild-type hiv, 
hiv-env-(l799r/l800q) virions, cannot bind phb1/phb2, exhibited a
cell-dependent replicative phenotype similar hiv-env-tr712, lacking
the entire env-ct domain. thus, replicative spread achieved, although
somewhat delayed, "permissive" mt-4 cells failed occur in
"nonpermissive" h9 cells. results point binding phb1/phb2
complex env-ct importance replicative spread in
nonpermissive cells, possibly modulating critical phb-dependent cellular
process(es).
