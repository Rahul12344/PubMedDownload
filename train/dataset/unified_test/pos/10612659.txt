host proteins incorporated inside human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) virions. identify cellular proteins inside hiv-1, virion
preparations treated protease-digestion technique removes external
host proteins, allowing study proteins inside virus. treated
hiv-1 preparations analyzed immunoblot, high-pressure liquid
chromatography, protein sequence analyses. analyses identified several 
cellular proteins inside hiv-1: elongation factor 1alpha,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hs-1, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding 
protein, pin1, lck, nm23-h1, c-terminal tail cd43. several these
proteins found fragments full-sized proteins appear be
generated protease treatment virions, hiv-1 protease, a
cellular protease. recent advances cell biology biochemistry have
identified proteins actin-binding proteins. results
support hypothesis actin filaments incorporated virion 
may provide additional clues understanding interaction between
viral cellular proteins assembly budding.
