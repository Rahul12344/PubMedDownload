toll-like receptors (tlrs) crucial innate immune response to
pathogens, recognize respond pathogen associated molecular
patterns, leads activation intracellular signaling pathways and
altered gene expression. vaccinia virus (vv), poxvirus used vaccinate
against smallpox, encodes proteins antagonize important components host
antiviral defense. show vv protein a52r blocks activation of
the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappa b) multiple tlrs,
including tlr3, recently identified receptor viral rna. a52r associates
with interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (irak2) tumor necrosis
factor receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6), two key proteins important tlr
signal transduction. further, a52r could disrupt signaling complexes containing
these proteins. virus deletion mutant lacking a52r gene attenuated
compared wild-type revertant controls murine intranasal model of
infection. study reveals novel mechanism used vv suppress host
immunity. demonstrate viral disabling tlrs, providing evidence 
an important role family receptors antiviral response.
