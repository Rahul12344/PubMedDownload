available data suggest varicella-zoster virus (vzv) ie4 protein acts 
an important regulator vzv cellular genes expression could exert its
functions post-transcriptional level. however, molecular mechanisms
supported protein yet fully characterized. present study, 
we attempted clarify ie4-mediated gene regulation identify 
cellular partners ie4. yeast two-hybrid immunoprecipitation analysis,
we showed ie4 interacts three shuttling sr proteins, namely asf/sf2,
9g8 srp20. positioned binding domain ie4 rbrc region we
showed interactions bridged rna. demonstrated also 
ie4 strongly interacts main sr protein kinase, srpk1, is
phosphorylated vitro kinase assay residue ser-136 contained rb
domain. northwestern analysis, showed ie4 able bind rna 
its arginine-rich region immunoprecipitation experiments presence of
rna stabilizes complexes containing ie4 cellular export factors tap/nxf1 
and aly/ref since interactions rnase-sensitive. finally, determined
that ie4 influences export reporter mrnas clearly showed, tap/nxf1 
knockdown, vzv infection requires tap/nxf1 export pathway express
some viral transcripts. thus highlighted new example viral mrna export
factor proposed model ie4-mediated viral mrnas export.
