background: despite intensive investigation mechanism hiv-1 reaches 
the host cell nucleus unknown. tnpo3, karyopherin mediating nuclear entry of
sr-proteins, shown required hiv-1 infectivity. investigators
have reported tnpo3 promotes hiv-1 nuclear import, would expected 
a karyopherin. yet, equal number investigators failed obtain
evidence supports model. here, series experiments performed
to better elucidate mechanism tnpo3 promotes hiv-1 infectivity.
results: examine role tnpo3 hiv-1 replication, 2-ltr circles
that commonly used marker hiv-1 nuclear entry cloned after
infection tnpo3 knockdown cells. potential explanation discrepancy 
the literature concerning effect tnpo3 provided sequencing hundreds
of clones: significant fraction resulted autointegration sites 
near ltrs therefore bona fide 2-ltr circles. response this
finding, new techniques developed monitor hiv-1 cdna, including qpcr
reactions distinguish 2-ltr circles autointegrants, well massive 
parallel sequencing hiv-1 cdna. assays, tnpo3 knockdown found
to reduce levels 2-ltr circles. finding puzzling, though, since
previous work shown hiv-1 determinant tnpo3-dependence capsid
(ca), hiv-1 protein forms mega-dalton protein lattice cytoplasm.
tnpo3 imports cellular splicing factors via sr-domain. attention was
therefore directed towards cpsf6, sr-protein binds hiv-1 ca inhibits 
hiv-1 nuclear import c-terminal sr-domain deleted. effect 27
hiv-1 capsid mutants sensitivity tnpo3 knockdown found to
correlate strongly sensitivity inhibition c-terminal deletion mutant
of cpsf6 (r2 = 0.883, p < 0.0001). tnpo3 knockdown shown cause cpsf6 
to accumulate cytoplasm. mislocalization cpsf6 cytoplasm,
whether tnpo3 knockdown, deletion cpsf6 nuclear localization signal, or
by fusion cpsf6 nuclear export signal, resulted inhibition hiv-1
replication. additionally, targeting cpsf6 nucleus fusion a
heterologous nuclear localization signal rescued hiv-1 inhibitory
effects tnpo3 knockdown. finally, mislocalization cpsf6 cytoplasm
was associated abnormal stabilization hiv-1 ca core.
conclusion: tnpo3 promotes hiv-1 infectivity indirectly, shifting the
ca-binding protein cpsf6 nucleus, thus preventing excessive hiv-1 ca
stability would otherwise result cytoplasmic accumulation cpsf6.
