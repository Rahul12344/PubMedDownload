infection high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpv) lead development
of cervical cancer. process depends interaction virus-encoded 
oncoproteins, e6 e7, variety host regulatory proteins. e7 shares
both functional structural similarities adenovirus e1a (ad e1a)
protein, interested investigating possible interactions e7
and transcriptional coactivator p300, since originally identified a
target ad e1a. using variety assays, show e7s high- and
low-risk hpv types interact p300. mutational analysis e7 maps site of
the interaction region spanning prb-binding domain ckii
phosphorylation site. also map site interaction p300 largely 
ch1 domain. addition, demonstrate binding 16e7 p300 is
direct, detected vivo coimmunoprecipitation mammalian
two-hybrid assays. finally, show e7 abolish p300-mediated e2
transactivation function, suggesting complex formation e7 p300
may contribute regulation e2 transcriptional activity.
