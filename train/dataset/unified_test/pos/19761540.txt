the envelope human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) consists large number of
glycoproteins. abundant glycoprotein hcmv envelope the
glycoprotein (ul100), together glycoprotein n (ul73) form gm/gn 
protein complex. using yeast two-hybrid screening, found gm
carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (gm-ct) interacts fip4, rab11-gtpase
effector protein. depletion fip4 expression hcmv-infected cells resulted in
a decrease infectious virus production also associated an
alteration hcmv assembly compartment (ac) phenotype. similar phenotype
was also observed hcmv-infected cells expressed dominant negative
rab11(s25n). recently, shown fip4 interactions rab11 and
additionally arf6/arf5 important vesicular transport proteins
in endosomal recycling compartment (erc) cytokinesis.
surprisingly, fip4 interaction gm-ct limited binding fip4 arf5/arf6;
however, fip4 interaction gm-ct prevent recruitment rab11 into
the ternary complex. data argued contribution erc during
cytoplasmic envelopment hcmv showed novel fip4 function independent of
arf5 arf6 activity.
