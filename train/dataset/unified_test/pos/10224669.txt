the related viruses herpes simplex virus (hsv) varicella zoster virus (vzv)
show distinct related patterns latent infection reactivation human 
sensory ganglia. cellular pou family transcription factors brn-3a brn-3b 
are expressed sensory ganglia bind taatgarat (r stands purine) 
regulatory motifs immediate-early gene promoters viruses. show
that brn-3a activates full length hsv ie1 promoter whereas brn-3b represses
its activity. contrast brn-3a brn-3b activate full length vzv ie 
promoter. response full length vzv promoter brn-3b observed 
with minimal vzv immediate-early promoter lacking taatgarat elements and
cannot restored addition either upstream taatgarat-containing region
of hsv ie promoter vzv taatgarat-like element minimal promoter. 
the unique effect brn-3b full length vzv immediate early gene promoter 
may play key role distinct pattern latent infection reactivation 
observed virus vivo.
