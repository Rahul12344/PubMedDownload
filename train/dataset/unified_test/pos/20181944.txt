langerin, endocytic receptor langerhans cells, binds pathogens as
human immunodeficiency virus recognition surface glycoconjugates and
mediates internalization birbeck granules. langerin an
extracellular region consisting c-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd)
and neck region stabilizes formation trimers. many c-type
lectins, oligomerization required high affinity binding glycan ligands 
and also likely important determining specificity. facilitate
structural analysis human langerin trimer, truncated form the
extracellular region, consisting part neck crd, been
characterized. like full-length protein, truncated langerin exists a
stable trimer solution. glycan array screening trimeric fragment
shows high mannose oligosaccharides best ligands langerin.
structural analysis trimeric fragment langerin confirms neck
region forms coiled-coil alpha-helices. multiple interactions the
neck region crds make trimer rigid unit three crds in
fixed positions primary sugar-binding sites separated distance 42
a. fixed orientation sugar-binding sites trimer likely to
place constraints ligands bound langerin.
