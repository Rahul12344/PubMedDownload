the bag family hsp70/hsc70 co-chaperones characterised presence a
conserved bag domain carboxyl-terminus. bag3 protein member of
this family containing also n-terminally located ww domain. describe 
the identification adenovirus (ad) penton base protein first bag3
partner recognising bag3 ww domain. ad penton base viral capsid
constituent responsible virus internalisation. contains n-terminal 
part two conserved ppxy motifs, known ligands ww domains. cells producing
ad penton base protein, cytoplasmic endogenous bag3 interacts and
co-migrates nucleus. preincubation bag3 ad base protein results in
only slight modulation bag3 co-chaperone activity, suggesting this
interaction related classical bag3 co-chaperone function. however, 
depletion bag3 impairs cell entry virus viral progeny
production ad-infected cells, suggesting interaction virus
penton base protein cellular co-chaperone bag3 positively influences virus
life cycle. results thus demonstrate novel host-pathogen interaction,
which contributes successful infectious life cycle adenoviruses. in
addition, data enrich knowledge multifunctionality the
bag3 co-chaperone.
