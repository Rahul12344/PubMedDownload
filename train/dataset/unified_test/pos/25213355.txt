ns2 influenza virus mediates crm1-dependent vrnp nuclear export through
interaction crm1. however, even though nuclear export signal 1 (nes1) of
ns2 play requisite role ns2-crm1 interaction, doubt
that nes1 crucial vrnp nuclear export. mechanism nes1 
still unclear, speculated certain host partners might mediate nes1
function interaction nes1. present study,
chromodomain-helicase-dna-binding protein 3 (chd3) identified novel host
nuclear protein locating ns2 crm1 dense chromatin ns2 and
crm1-dependent vrnp nuclear export. chd3 confirmed interact nes1 in
ns2, disruption interaction mutation nes1 significantly
delayed viral vrnps export viral propagation. further, knockdown chd3 
would affect propagation wild-type virus mutant the
weakened ns2-chd3 interaction. therefore, study demonstrates nes1 is
required maximal binding ns2 chd3, ns2-chd3 interaction on
the dense chromatin contributed ns2-mediated vrnp nuclear export.
