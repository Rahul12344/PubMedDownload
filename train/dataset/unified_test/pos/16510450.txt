the mismatch repair (mmr) system, highly conserved throughout evolution, corrects
nucleotide mispairing arise cellular dna replication. report 
that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), clamp loader complex (rf-c), 
and series mmr proteins like msh-2, msh-6, mlh1, hpsm2 assembled 
to epstein-barr virus replication compartments, sites viral dna synthesis.
levels dna-bound form pcna increased progression viral
productive replication. bromodeoxyuridine-labeled chromatin immunodepletion
analyses confirmed pcna loaded onto newly synthesized viral dna well
as balf2 bmrf1 viral proteins lytic replication. furthermore, the
anti-pcna, -msh2, -msh3, -msh6 antibodies could immunoprecipitate bmrf1
replication protein probably via viral dna genome. pcna loading might trigger
transfer series host mmr proteins sites viral dna synthesis.
the mmr factors might function repair mismatches arise during
viral replication act inhibit recombination moderately divergent
(homologous) sequences.
