rinderpest virus (rpv) morbillivirus causes highly contagious disease
affecting members order artiodactyla. viral l protein catalytic
subunit rna-dependent rna polymerase. search host cell proteins
with l interacts, library screen performed using yeast two-hybrid
system. several host cell proteins recovered library screen as
putative l-interactors; one identified striatin. direct
interaction rpv l striatin confirmed using both
co-immunoprecipitation assays co-localisation studies using confocal
microscopy. striatin also shown co-localise rpv l protein in
infected cells. l proteins morbilliviruses consist three long highly
conserved domains separated short unconserved stretches amino acids. l 
domain striatin interacts investigated co-immunoprecipitation
and striatin shown interact primarily central conserved domain.
