il-18 induces ifn-gamma nk cell cytotoxicity, making logical target 
viral antagonism host defense. demonstrate ectromelia poxvirus p13
protein, bearing homology mammalian il-18 binding protein, binds il-18,
and inhibits activity vitro. binding il-18 viral p13 protein was
compared binding cellular il-18r. dissociation constant p13
for murine il-18 5 nm, compared 0.2 nm cellular receptor
heterodimer. mice infected p13 deletion mutant ectromelia virus had
elevated cytotoxicity yac-1 tumor cell targets compared control animals.
additionally, p13 deletion mutant virus exhibited decreased levels of
infectivity. data suggest inactivation il-18, subsequent
impairment nk cell cytotoxicity, may one mechanism ectromelia
evades host immune response.
