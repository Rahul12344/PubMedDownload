recognition viral nucleic acids pattern recognition receptors initiates
type ifn induction innate antiviral immune response. show that
lsm14a, member lsm family involved rna processing processing
bodies, binds synthetic viral rna dna mediates irf3 activation 
ifn-β induction. knockdown lsm14a inhibits cytosolic rna- dna-trigger type
i ifn production cellular antiviral response. moreover, lsm14a essential
for early-phase induction ifn-β either rna dna virus infection. we
further found lsm14a-mediated ifn-β induction requires rig-i-visa mita
after rna dna virus infection, respectively, viral infection causes
translocation lsm14a peroxisomes, rig-i, visa, mita located. 
these findings suggest lsm14a sensor viral rna dna and
plays important role initiating ifn-β induction early phase viral
infection.
