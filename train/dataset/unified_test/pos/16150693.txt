the mhv-68 latent protein, m2, homology known viral or
cellular proteins, function unclear. define role played m2
during mhv-68 latency well molecular mechanism involved, used m2 
bait screen yeast two-hybrid mouse b-cell cdna library. vav1 identified 
as m2-interacting protein two independent screenings. subsequent yeast
two-hybrid interaction studies showed m2 also binds vav2, vav3,
and three "pxxp" motifs located c terminus m2 important for
this interaction. interactions m2 vav proteins also
confirmed vivo 293t wehi-231 b-cells co-immunoprecipitation assays. 
rac1/gst-pak "pull-down" experiments western blot analysis using a
phospho-vav antibody demonstrated expression m2 wehi-231 cells
enhances vav activity. showed wehi-231 cells m2 expression
promotes proliferation survival associated enhanced cyclin d2 and
repressed p27(kip1), p130, bim expression. taken together, experiments 
suggest m2 might important role disseminating latent virus
during establishment maintenance latency modulating b-cell
receptor-mediated signaling events vav promote b-cell activation,
proliferation, survival.
