despite presence hiv-1 oral cavity, transmission virus
through saliva proven. consistent observations, we
recently identified endogenous 12 kd protein, secretory leukocyte protease
inhibitor (slpi), saliva blocks hiv-1 infection vitro. whereas 
salivary proteins tested inactive, purified native recombinant slpi
inhibited hiv-1 infection human monocytes 100 ng ml-1. levels slpi
quantitated elisa saliva control hiv-1 infected individuals
exceeded level, consistent vivo antiviral activity. saliva,
levels slpi mrna determined northern hybridization, protein assessed
by immunohistochemistry salivary glands control infected
populations comparable. contrast adults, oral transmission occurs in
infants, possibly due lack fully developed salivary glands. to
determine whether inadequate antiviral protection might compensated by
maternal sources, evaluated breast milk samples obtained 6 months postpartum. 
levels slpi significantly lower saliva sufficient to
provide antiviral protection contrast colostrum samples slpi
levels equivalent saliva able inhibit hiv-1 infection
when tested vitro. data suggest breast milk may provide transient
antiviral activity newborn, maternal source slpi of
insufficient duration maintain protection mucosal transmission 
virus time. high functional levels slpi saliva low levels 
in mature breast milk correlate negligible rates hiv-1 transmission by
saliva higher rates breast feeding.
