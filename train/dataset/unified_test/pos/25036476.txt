during hsv-1 infection, viral ul31 protein forms complex ul34
protein cellular nuclear membrane, proteins play important
roles envelopment viral nucleocapsids egress the
cytoplasm. characterize mechanism hsv-1 nucleocapsid egress, we
screened host proteins identify proteins interacted ul31 via yeast
two-hybrid analysis. transmembrane protein 140 (tmem140), identified and
confirmed bind co-localize ul31 viral infection. further
studies indicated tmem140 inhibits hsv-1 proliferation selectively
blocking viral nucleocapsid egress viral assembly process. the
blockage function tmem140 mediated impeding formation the
ul31-ul34 complex due competitive binding ul31. collectively, data
suggest essentiality ul31-ul34 interaction viral nucleocapsid
egress process provide new anti-hsv-1 strategy viral assembly process of
nucleocapsid egress.
