varicella-zoster virus (vzv), alphaherpesvirus restricted humans, infects
differentiated cells vivo, including lymphocytes, keratinocytes, and
neurons, spreads rapidly confluent cultured dermal fibroblasts (hffs). 
vzv-infected hffs, atypical expression cyclins d3 b1 occurs along the
induction cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity. specific cdk1 inhibitor
blocked vzv spread, indicating important function cellular kinase 
vzv replication. cdk activity assays infected cells revealed large viral
phosphoprotein identified major immediate-early
transactivator, ie62. since ie62 colocalized cdk1/cyclin b1 confocal
microscopy, investigated whether cellular kinase complex interacts with
ie62. using recombinant fragments ie62 spanning entire amino acid
sequence, found purified cdk1/cyclin b1 phosphorylated ie62 residues
t10, s245, t680 vitro. immunoprecipitation cyclin b1 vzv-infected 
hffs indicated ie62 included complex within infected cells. the
full-length ie62 protein, obtained immunoprecipitation infected cells,
was also phosphorylated purified cdk1/cyclin b1. based ie62/cdk1/cyclin b1 
colocalization near viral assembly regions, hypothesized cellular
proteins could incorporated vzv virions ie62. purified virions 
analyzed immunoblotting presence cdk1 cyclin b1, active
cdk1 cyclin b1 present vzv tegument ie62 sensitive 
to detergent treatment. thus, ie62 substrate cdk1/cyclin b1, virions
could deliver active cellular kinase nondividing cells normally do
not express it.
