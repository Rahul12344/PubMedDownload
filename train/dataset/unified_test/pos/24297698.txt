hepatitis b virus (hbv) genome transcription highly dependent on
liver-enriched, metabolic nuclear receptors (nrs). among others, nr farnesoid x
receptor α (fxrα) enhances hbv core promoter activity pregenomic rna
synthesis. interestingly, two food-withdrawal-induced fxrα modulators, peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (pgc-1α) deacetylase sirt1, 
have found associated hbv genomes ex vivo. whereas pgc-1α
induction shown increase hbv replication, effect sirt1 hbv
transcription remains unknown. here, showed that, hepatocarcinoma-derived
huh-7 cells, combined activation fxrα gw4064 sirt1 activator 3
increased hbv core promoter-controlled luciferase expression 25-fold, compared
with 10-fold increase gw4064 alone. using cell lines differentially
expressing fxrα overexpression silencing experiments, demonstrated that
sirt1 activated core promoter fxrα- pgc-1α-dependent manner.
maximal activation (>150-fold) observed fxrα- pgc-1α-overexpressing
huh-7 cells treated fxrα sirt1 activators. similarly, cells
transfected full-length hbv genomes, maximal induction (3.5-fold) core
promoter-controlled synthesis 3.5-kb rna observed conditions
of transfection treatments. thus, identified subnetwork metabolic
factors regulating hbv replication, strengthening hypothesis that
transcription hbv metabolic genes similarly controlled.
