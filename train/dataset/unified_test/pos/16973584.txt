foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) use number integrins receptors to
initiate infection. attachment integrin mediated highly conserved 
arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (rgd) tripeptide located gh loop vp1.
other residues loop also conserved may contribute integrin
binding. study used 17-mer peptide, whose sequence corresponds 
to gh loop vp1 type fmdv, competitor integrin-mediated virus 
binding infection. alanine substitution peptide identified the
leucines first fourth positions following rgd (rgd+1 rgd+4 sites) 
as key inhibition virus binding infection mediated alphavbeta6 or
alphavbeta8 inhibition virus binding alphavbeta3. also show 
that fmdv peptides containing either methionine arginine rgd+1 site,
which reflects natural sequence variation seen across fmdv serotypes, are
effective inhibitors alphavbeta6. contrast, although rgdm-containing
peptides effective alphavbeta8, rgdr-containing peptides not. these
observations confirmed showing virus containing rgdr motif uses
alphavbeta8 less efficiently alphavbeta6 receptor infection.
finally, evidence presented shows alphavbeta3 poor receptor for
infection type fmdv. taken together, data suggest integrin
binding loop fmdv likely evolved binding alphavbeta6 a
higher affinity alphavbeta3 alphavbeta8.
