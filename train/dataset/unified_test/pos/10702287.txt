hepatitis c virus ns5a protein transcriptionally modulates cellular genes and
promotes cell growth. ns5a likely exert activity concert with
cellular factor(s). using yeast two-hybrid screen, demonstrated that
ns5a interacts c-terminal end newly identified cellular
transcription factor, srcap. authenticity interaction verified by
a mammalian two-hybrid assay, vitro pull-down experiment, vivo
coimmunoprecipitation assay human hepatoma (hepg2) cells. vitro
transient transfection assay demonstrated srcap efficiently activate
transcription recruited gal4 dna-binding domain promoter.
however, down-regulation p21 promoter activity ns5a enhanced following 
ectopic expression srcap. together results suggest interaction 
of ns5a srcap may one mechanisms ns5a exerts effect on
cell growth regulation contributing hepatitis c virus-mediated pathogenesis.
