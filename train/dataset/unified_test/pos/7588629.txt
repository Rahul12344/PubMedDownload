we examined differential binding hck fyn hiv-1 nef to
elucidate structural basis sh3 binding affinity specificity.
full-length nef bound hck sh3 highest affinity reported an
sh3-mediated interaction (kd 250 nm). contrast hck, affinity highly 
homologous fyn sh3 nef weak (kd > 20 microm) accurately
determined. show distinct specificity lies variable loop, the
'rt loop', positioned close conserved sh3 residues implicated binding
of proline-rich (pxxp) motifs. mutant fyn sh3 single amino acid
substitution (r96i) rt loop affinity (kd 380 nm) nef comparable
with hck sh3. based additional mutagenesis studies propose the
selective recognition nef hck sh3 determined hydrophobic interactions
involving isoleucine residue rt loop. although nef contains pxxp
motif necessary interaction hck sh3, high affinity binding 
was observed intact nef protein. binding peptide containing the
nef pxxp motif showed > 300-fold weaker affinity hck sh3 full-length
nef.
