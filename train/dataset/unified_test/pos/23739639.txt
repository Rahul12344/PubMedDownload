herpes simplex virus type 1 important epithelial pathogen the
potential significant morbidity humans. demonstrate cell
surface scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor collagenous structure
(marco), previously thought enhance antiviral defense enabling nucleic acid
recognition, usurped herpes simplex virus type 1 functions together
with heparan sulphate proteoglycans mediate adsorption epithelial cells.
ligands marco dramatically inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 adsorption 
infection human keratinocytes protect mice infection. herpes
simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein c closely co-localizes marco cell
surface, glycoprotein c binds directly purified marco high affinity. 
increasing marco expression enhances herpes simplex virus type 1 infection 
marco(-/-) mice reduced susceptibility infection herpes simplex virus 
type 1. findings demonstrate herpes simplex virus type 1 binds to
marco enhance capacity disease, suggests new therapeutic target 
to alter pathogenicity herpes simplex virus type 1 skin infection.
