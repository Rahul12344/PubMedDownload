human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) ubiquitous human herpesvirus cause
life-threatening disease fetus immunocompromised host. upon
attachment cell, virus induces robust inflammatory, interferon- and
growth-factor-like signalling. mechanisms facilitating viral entry gene
expression clearly understood. show platelet-derived growth 
factor-alpha receptor (pdgfr-alpha) specifically phosphorylated both
laboratory clinical isolates hcmv various human cell types, resulting
in activation phosphoinositide-3-kinase (pi(3)k) signalling pathway. upon 
stimulation hcmv, tyrosine-phosphorylated pdgfr-alpha associated p85 
regulatory subunit pi(3)k induced protein kinase b (also known akt)
phosphorylation, similar genuine ligand, pdgf-aa. cells which
pdgfr-alpha genetically deleted functionally blocked non-permissive
to hcmv entry, viral gene expression infectious virus production.
re-introducing human pdgfra gene knockout cells restored susceptibility to
viral entry essential viral gene expression. blockade receptor function
with humanized pdgfr-alpha blocking antibody (imc-3g3) targeted inhibition
of kinase activity small molecule (gleevec) completely inhibited hcmv 
viral internalization gene expression human epithelial, endothelial and
fibroblast cells. viral entry cells harbouring endogenous pdgfr-alpha was
competitively inhibited pretreatment pdgf-aa. demonstrate that
hcmv glycoprotein b directly interacts pdgfr-alpha, resulting receptor
tyrosine phosphorylation, glycoprotein b neutralizing antibodies inhibit
hcmv-induced pdgfr-alpha phosphorylation. taken together, data indicate
that pdgfr-alpha critical receptor required hcmv infection, thus a
target novel anti-viral therapies.
