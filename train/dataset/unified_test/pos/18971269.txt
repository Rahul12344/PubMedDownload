varicella-zoster virus (vzv) immediate-early 63 protein (ie63) abundantly
expressed acute infection vitro latent infection human
ganglia. using yeast two-hybrid system, found vzv ie63 interacts with
human antisilencing function 1 protein (asf1). asf1 nucleosome assembly
factor member h3/h4 family histone chaperones. ie63
coimmunoprecipitated colocalized asf1 transfected cells expressing
ie63 vzv-infected cells. ie63 also colocalized asf1 lytic and
latently vzv-infected enteric neurons. asf1 exists two isoforms, asf1a and
asf1b, mammalian cells. ie63 preferentially bound asf1a, the
amino-terminal 30 amino acids asf1a critical interaction with
ie63. vzv ie63 amino acids 171 208 putative phosphorylation sites ie63,
both critical virus replication latency rodents, were
important interaction ie63 asf1. finally, found ie63
increased binding asf1 histone h3.1 h3.3, suggests ie63 
may help regulate levels histones virus-infected cells. since asf1
mediates eviction deposition histones transcription, the
interaction vzv ie63 asf1 may help regulate transcription viral 
cellular genes lytic and/or latent infection.
