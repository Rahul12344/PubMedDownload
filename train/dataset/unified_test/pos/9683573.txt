we cloned htid-1, human homolog drosophila tumor suppressor protein
tid56, virtue ability form complexes human papillomavirus
e7 oncoprotein. carboxyl terminal cysteine-rich metal binding domain e7 is
the major determinant interaction htid-1. carboxyl terminus e7 is
essential functional structural integrity e7 previously
been shown function multimerization domain. htid-1 protein a
member dnaj-family chaperones. mrna widely expressed human
tissues, including hpv-18-positive cervical carcinoma cell line hela and
human genital keratinocytes, normal host cells hpvs. htid-1 gene
has mapped short arm chromosome 16. large tumor antigens of
polyomaviruses encode functional j-domains important viral
replication well cellular transformation. ability hpv e7 interact
with cellular dnaj protein suggests two viral oncoproteins may
target common regulatory pathways j-domains.
