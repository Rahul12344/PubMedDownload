coronavirus rna synthesis performed multienzymatic replicase complex
together cellular factors. process requires specific recognition of
rna cis-acting signals located ends viral genome. identify
cellular proteins involved coronavirus rna synthesis, transmissible
gastroenteritis coronavirus (tgev) genome ends, harboring essential cis-acting
signals replication, used baits rna affinity protein
purification. ten proteins preferentially pulled either 5' 
3' ends genome identified proteomic analysis. nine them,
including members heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein family proteins
(hnrnps), poly(a)-binding protein (pabp), p100 transcriptional
co-activator protein two aminoacyl-trna synthetases, showed preferential
binding 3' end genome, whereas polypyrimidine
tract-binding protein (ptb) preferentially pulled 5' end the
genome. potential function 3' end-interacting proteins virus
replication studied analyzing effect silencing using a
tgev-derived replicon infectious virus. gene silencing pabp, hnrnp q, 
and glutamyl-prolyl-trna synthetase (eprs) caused significant 2 3-fold
reduction viral rna synthesis. interestingly, silencing glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), initially used control gene, caused 2
to 3-fold increase viral rna synthesis systems. data suggest
that pabp, hnrnp q, eprs play positive role virus infection could
be mediated interaction viral 3' end, gapdh a
negative effect viral infection.
