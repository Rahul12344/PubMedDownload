the phosphorylation hiv-1 rev protein kinase ck2 strictly dependent on
the regulatory beta subunit kinase deeply affected by
conformational changes substrate outside phosphorylation site. we
show rev modulates variety ck2 properties, including
autophosphorylation, catalytic activity toward calmodulin, susceptibility 
polycationic effectors, whose common denominator involvement beta
subunit. rev's two major ck2 sites located n-terminus, immediately
adjacent helix-loop-helix motif. comparing behaviour full-size rev
with synthetic peptides reproducing, suitable modifications, its
n-terminal 26 amino acids including phosphoacceptor site (ser 5, ser 8) and
amphipathic helix-1, appears functional interaction n-terminal
portion rev n-terminal domain beta subunit must rely both
electrostatic hydrophobic interactions. former mainly involve rev's
arginine-rich domain (residues 35-50) helix-2, latter mostly
mediated residues 12-24 helix-1. data disclose possibility that, 
besides displaying protective, regulatory targeting properties respect
to catalytic subunit, ck2 beta subunit also plays role docking
site subset ck2 substrates.
