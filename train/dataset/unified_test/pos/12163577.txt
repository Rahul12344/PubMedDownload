the nuclear hormone receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (hnf4) retinoid
x alpha (rxralpha) plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
(pparalpha) heterodimer support hepatitis b virus (hbv) replication in
nonhepatoma cells. hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (hnf3) inhibits nuclear hormone
receptor-mediated viral replication. inhibition hbv replication hnf3beta is
associated preferential reduction level pregenomic rna
compared precore rna. hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag), encoded 
precore rna, mediates part inhibition viral replication hnf3beta.
the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain hnf3beta essential for
the inhibition hbv replication. activation transcription hnf3 from
hbv promoters downstream nucleocapsid promoter appears contribute
indirectly reduction steady-state level 3.5-kb hbv rna, possibly
by interfering elongation rate transcripts. therefore,
transcriptional interference mediated hnf3 may also regulate hbv rna synthesis
and viral replication.
