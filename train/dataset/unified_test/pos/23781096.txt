tgf-β signaling induces epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt) plays an
important role hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) development. clinical
observations indicate hepatitis c virus (hcv) chronic infection, 
major cause hcc, induces tgf-β signaling perturbations. here, investigate
the mechanisms hcv nonstructural proteins interfere tgf-β
signaling, human hepatoma cell lines expressing hcv subgenomic replicon. a
transcriptomic study showed tgf-β stimulation cells resulted a
protumoral gene expression profile up-regulation emt-related genes
compared control interferon-treated cells expressing hcv proteins. we
found viral protease ns3-4a interacted smurf2, negative regulator
of tgf-β signaling. cells expressing hcv subgenomic replicon ns3-4a, tgf-β 
stimulation induced increased expression smad-dependent genes compared to
control cells. enhanced signaling suppressed smurf2 overexpression
and mimicked smurf2 silencing. addition, ns3-4a expression resulted an
increased prolonged tgf-β-induced phosphorylation smad2/3 was
abrogated smurf2 overexpression. neither ns3-4a protease activity smurf2
ubiquitin-ligase activity required affect tgf-β signaling. therefore, by
targeting smurf2, ns3-4a appears block negative regulation tgf-β
signaling, increasing responsiveness cells tgf-β.
