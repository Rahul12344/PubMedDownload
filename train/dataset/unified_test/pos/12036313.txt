hiv-1 tat protein regulates viral gene expression modulating activity 
association cellular transcription factors rna polymerase ii (rnapii).
possible mechanisms include tat-associated protein kinase(s) phosphatase(s)
that regulate phosphorylation c-terminal domain (ctd) large subunit
of rnapii. hypophosphorylated rnapii (rnapiia) recruited promoters during
formation preinitiation complex, whereas hyperphosphorylated rnapii
(rnapiio) associated elongation complex. role phosphatases 
maintaining equilibrium two phosphorylated states rnapii,
which required sustained transcriptional activation hiv-1 ltr, is
not clear. study, discuss properties tat-associated ctd
phosphatase fractionated jurkat cells. tat-associated protein
phosphatase (tapp) related serine/threonine, type 1, protein
phosphatase (pp1) family. tapp dephosphorylates hyperphosphorylated form of
recombinant ctd specifically serine 2, augments tat-mediated
transcriptional transactivation hiv-1 ltr vitro transcription
reaction. tapp associated transcription complex early
initiation steps, release hiv-1 promoter coincides the
tat-specific activation cdk9. results suggest unique role the
tat-associated phosphatase regulates viral transcription target-specific
dephosphorylation rnapii early stages elongation.
