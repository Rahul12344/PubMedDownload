nonstructural protein 3a foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) partially
conserved protein 153 amino acids fmdvs examined date. role 
3a virus growth virulence within natural host well understood. 
using yeast two-hybrid approach, identified cellular protein dctn3 a
specific host binding partner 3a. dctn3 subunit dynactin complex,
a cofactor dynein, motor protein. dynactin-dynein duplex been
implicated several subcellular functions involving intracellular organelle
transport. 3a-dctn3 interaction identified yeast two-hybrid approach
was confirmed mammalian cells. overexpression dctn3 proteins
known disrupt dynein, p150/glued 50/dynamitin, resulted decreased fmdv 
replication infected cells. mapped critical amino acid residues 
3a protein mediate protein interaction dctn3 mutational analysis
and, based information, developed mutant harboring same
mutations o1 campos fmdv (o1c3a-pldgv). although o1c3a-pldgv fmdv its
parental virus (o1cv) grew equally well lfbk-αvβ6, o1c3a-pldgv virus exhibited
a decreased ability replicate primary bovine cell cultures. importantly,
o1c3a-pldgv virus exhibited delayed disease cattle compared virulent 
parental o1campus (o1cv). virus isolated lesions animals inoculated 
o1c3a-pldgv virus contained amino acid substitutions area 3a mediating 
binding dctn3. importantly, 3a protein harboring similar amino acid
substitutions regained interaction dctn3, supporting hypothesis that
dctn3 interaction likely contributes virulence cattle.importance: the
objective study understand possible role fmd virus
protein 3a, causing disease cattle. found cellular
protein, dctn3, specific binding partner 3a. shown that
manipulation dctn3 profound effect virus replication. developed 
fmdv mutant virus could bind dctn3. mutant virus exhibited a
delayed disease cattle compared parental strain highlighting role
of 3a-dctn3 interaction virulence cattle. interestingly, virus isolated
from lesions animals inoculated mutant virus contained mutations the
area 3a allowed binding dctn3. highlights importance the
3a-dctn3 interaction fmd virus virulence provides possible mechanisms of
virus attenuation development improved fmd vaccines.
