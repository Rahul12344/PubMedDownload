the replication transcription activator (rta) protein kaposi's sarcoma
(ks)-associated herpesvirus (kshv)/human herpesvirus 8 functions key
regulator induce kshv lytic replication latency activation the
lytic cascade kshv. elucidation host factors involved rta-mediated
transcriptional activation pivotal understanding transition between
viral latency lytic replication. kshv-rta binding protein (k-rbp) was
previously isolated cellular rta binding protein unknown function.
sequence analysis showed k-rbp contains kruppel-associated box (krab) at
the n terminus 12 adjacent zinc finger motifs. similarity other
krab-containing zinc finger proteins, k-rbp transcriptional repressor.
mutational analysis revealed krab domain responsible the
transcriptional suppression activity protein repression is
histone deacetylase independent. k-rbp found repress rta-mediated
transactivation interact tif1beta (transcription intermediary factor
1beta), common corepressor krab-containing protein, synergize k-rbp 
in repression. overexpression knockdown experiment results suggest k-rbp
is suppressor rta-mediated kshv reactivation. findings suggest 
krab-containing zinc finger protein k-rbp suppress rta-mediated
transactivation kshv lytic replication kshv utilizes protein as
a regulator maintain balance latency lytic replication.
