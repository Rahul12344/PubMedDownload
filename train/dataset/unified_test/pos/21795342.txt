human respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), major cause severe respiratory
diseases, efficiently suppresses cellular innate immunity, represented type 
interferon (ifn), using two unique nonstructural proteins, ns1 ns2. 
search mechanism, ns1 previously shown decrease levels traf3 
and ikkε, whereas ns2 interacted rig-i decreased traf3 stat2. here, 
we report interaction, cellular localization, functional domains of
these two proteins. show recombinant ns1 ns2, expressed lung
epithelial a549 cells, form homo- well heteromers. interestingly, 
expressed alone, substantial amounts ns1 ns2 localized nuclei and
to mitochondria, respectively. however, coexpressed ns2, rsv 
infection, ns1 could detected mitochondria well, suggesting the
ns1-ns2 heteromer localizes mitochondria. c-terminal tetrapeptide
sequence, dlnp, common ns1 ns2, required functions, 
not all, whereas ns1 n-terminal region important ikkε reduction.
finally, ns1 ns2 interacted specifically host
microtubule-associated protein 1b (map1b). contribution map1b ns1
function tested, ns2 essential stat2 destruction,
suggesting role novel dlnp motif protein-protein interaction ifn 
suppression.
