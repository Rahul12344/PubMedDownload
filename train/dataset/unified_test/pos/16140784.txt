hepatitis e virus (hev), human plus-stranded rna virus, contains three open
reading frames (orf). these, orf1 encodes viral nonstructural polyprotein,
orf2 encodes major capsid protein, orf3 codes phosphoprotein of
undefined function. recently, using yeast two-hybrid system screen human
cdna liver library, isolated characterized ambp
(alpha1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor), specifically interacts the
orf3 protein hev. orf3 protein expedites processing secretion of
alpha1-microglobulin. checked individually interaction, second
processed protein ambp, bikunin, strongly interacted full-length
orf3 protein. protein-protein interaction validated by
immunoprecipitation cos-1 huh7 cells his6 pull-down assays. in
dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining, followed fluorescence microscopy 
transfected human liver cells, orf3 colocalized endogenously expressed
bikunin. finally, 41-amino-acid c-terminal region orf3 found 
responsible interacting bikunin. importance virus-host
protein-protein interaction, reference viral life cycle, been
discussed.
