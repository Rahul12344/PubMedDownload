factor acetyltransferase activity associated several histone
acetyltransferases plays key role control transcription. we
report hgcn5, well known histone acetyltransferase, specifically interacts
with acetylates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
transactivator protein, tat. interaction tat hgcn5 direct 
involves acetyltransferase bromodomain regions hgcn5, well a
limited region tat encompassing cysteine-rich domain protein. tat
lysines 50 51, target acetylation p300/cbp, also found be
acetylated hgcn5. acetylation two lysines p300/cbp been
recently shown stimulate tat transcriptional activity accordingly, have
found hgcn5 considerably enhance tat-dependent transcription the
hiv-1 long terminal repeat. data highlight importance the
acetylation lysines 50 51 function tat, since different histone 
acetyltransferases involved distinct signaling pathways, gcn5 p300/cbp,
converge acetylate tat site.
