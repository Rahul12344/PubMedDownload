vaccine laboratory adapted strains measles virus use cd46 a
receptor infect many human cell lines. however, wild type isolates measles 
virus cannot use cd46, infect activated lymphocytes, dendritic cells,
and macrophages via receptor cd150/slam. wild type virus also infect
epithelial cells respiratory tract unidentified receptor. we
demonstrate wild type measles virus infects primary airway epithelial cells 
grown fetal calf serum many adenocarcinoma cell lines lung, breast,
and colon. transfection non-infectable adenocarcinoma cell lines an
expression vector encoding cd150/slam rendered susceptible measles virus,
indicating virus replication competent, lacked receptor 
virus attachment entry. microarray analysis susceptible versus
non-susceptible cell lines performed, comparison membrane protein gene
transcripts produced list 11 candidate receptors. these, human
tumor cell marker pvrl4 (nectin 4) rendered cells amenable measles virus
infections. flow cytometry confirmed pvrl4 highly expressed the
surfaces susceptible lung, breast, colon adenocarcinoma cell lines.
measles virus preferentially infected adenocarcinoma cell lines apical
surface, although basolateral infection observed reduced kinetics.
confocal immune fluorescence microscopy surface biotinylation experiments
revealed pvrl4 expressed apical basolateral surfaces 
these cell lines. antibodies sirna directed pvrl4 able block 
measles virus infections mcf7 nci-h358 cancer cells. virus binding assay
indicated pvrl4 bona fide receptor supported virus attachment 
the host cell. several strains measles virus also shown use pvrl4 a
receptor. measles virus infection reduced pvrl4 surface expression mcf7 cells,
a property characteristic receptor-associated viral infections.
