hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication dependent microrna 122 (mir-122), a
liver-specific microrna recruits argonaute 2 5' end viral
genome, stabilizing slowing decay cell-free reactions in
infected cells. describe rna degradation pathways which
mir-122 provides protection. transfected hcv rna degraded 5'
exonuclease xrn1 3' exonuclease exosome complex, whereas replicating rna
within infected cells degraded primarily xrn1 contribution the
exosome. consistent this, sequencing 5' 3' ends rna
degradation intermediates infected cells confirmed 5' decay the
primary pathway hcv rna degradation. xrn1 knockdown enhances hcv replication,
indicating xrn1 decay viral replicase compete set rna abundance
within infected cells. xrn1 knockdown mir-122 supplementation equal,
redundant, nonadditive effects rate viral rna decay, indicating
that mir-122 protects hcv rna 5' decay. nevertheless, xrn1 knockdown does
not rescue replication viral mutant defective mir-122 binding, indicating
that mir-122 additional yet uncharacterized function(s) viral life
cycle.
