field isolates foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) shown use 
rgd-dependent integrin alphavbeta3 cellular receptor cultured cells.
however, several rgd-dependent integrins may potential act as
receptors fmdv vivo. these, alphavbeta6 likely candidate use
as receptor fmdv expressed epithelial cells, correlates
with tissue tropism virus. report, show human colon
carcinoma cells (sw480) normally nonpermissive fmdv become
susceptible infection result transfection integrin beta6
subunit expression alphavbeta6 cell surface. integrin alphavbeta6
is major site virus attachment beta6-transfected cells, and
binding alphavbeta6 serves increase rate virus entry these
cells. addition, show virus binding infection the
beta6-transfected cells mediated rgd-dependent interaction 
specifically inhibited monoclonal antibody (10d5) recognizes
alphavbeta6. studies establish role alphavbeta6 cellular
receptor fmdv.
