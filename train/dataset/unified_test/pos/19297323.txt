although established functions dengue virus ns5 (nonstructural protein 5) 
occur cytoplasm, nuclear localization, mediated dual nuclear
localization sequences, essential virus replication. here, have
determined mechanism ns5 localize cytoplasm perform
its role replication, establishing first time able be
exported nucleus exportin crm1 hence shuttle 
nucleus cytoplasm. define nuclear export sequence responsible be
residues 327-343 confirm interaction ns5 crm1 pulldown assay.
significantly, greater nuclear accumulation ns5 infection due crm1
inhibition coincided altered kinetics virus production decreased
induction antiviral chemokine interleukin-8. first report a
nuclear export sequence within ns5 member flavivirus genus;
because high conservation within genus, may represent target 
the treatment diseases caused several medically important flaviviruses.
