acid cosensor human airway epithelial cells fibroblasts: deah
(asp-glu-ala-his) box polypeptide 29 (dhx29), member dexd/h

human epithelial cells fibroblasts independent stimulator interferon
genes dependent retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (rig-i) and
mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (mavs). dhx29 binds directly nucleic
acids interacts rig-i mavs helicase 1 domain, activating
the rig-i-mavs-dependent cytosolic nucleic acid response. results suggest
that dhx29 cytosolic nucleic acid cosensor triggers
rig-i/mavs-dependent signaling pathways. study important
implications drug vaccine design control viral infections and
viral-induced pathology airway.
