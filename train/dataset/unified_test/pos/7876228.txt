we isolated human cdna clone encoding hip116, protein binds 
sph repeats sv40 enhancer tata/inhibitor region human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1 promoter. predicted hip116 protein related 
to yeast snf2/swi2 transcription factor members extended
family contains seven domains similar found vaccinia ntp1
atpase. interestingly, hip116 also contains c3hc4 zinc-binding motif (ring
finger) interspersed atpase motifs arrangement similar 
found yeast rad5 rad16 proteins. hip116 amino terminus unique
among members family, houses specific dna-binding domain.
antiserum raised hip116 recognizes 116-kda nuclear protein western
blots specifically supershifts sv40 hiv-1 protein-dna complexes gel
shift experiments. binding site hip116 sv40 enhancer directly
overlaps site tef-1, like tef-1, binding hip116 sv40
enhancer destroyed mutations inhibit sph enhancer activity vivo.
purified fractions hip116 display strong atpase activity is
preferentially stimulated sph dna inhibited specifically by
antibodies hip116. findings suggest hip116 might affect
transcription, directly indirectly, acting dna binding site-specific
atpase.
