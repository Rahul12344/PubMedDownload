adenovirus type 5 e4orf4 multifunctional protein regulates viral gene
expression. activities e4orf4 mainly mediated binding to
protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a). e4orf4 recruits target phosphoproteins into
complexes pp2a, resulting dephosphorylation host factors, sr
splicing factors. current study, utilized immunoprecipitation followed 
by mass spectrometry identify novel e4orf4-interacting proteins. this
manner identified nup205, component nuclear pore complex (npc) 
e4orf4 interacting partner. arginine-rich motif (arm) e4orf4 required 
for interaction nup205 nuclear localization e4orf4. arms are
commonly found viral nuclear proteins, observed nup205 interacts
with three different nuclear viral proteins containing arms. e4orf4 formed a
trimolecular complex containing nup205 pp2a. furthermore, nup205
complexed e4orf4 hypophosphorylated, suggesting protein is
specifically targeted dephosphorylation. adenovirus mutant not
express e4orf4 (orf4(-)) displayed elevated early reduced late gene
expression relative wild type. observed knockdown of
nup205 resulted phenotype orf4(-) virus, suggesting
that proteins function complex regulate viral gene expression.
furthermore, knockdown nup205 resulted 4-fold reduction in
the replication wild-type adenovirus. data show first time ad5
e4orf4 interacts modifies npc nup205-e4orf4 binding is
required normal regulation viral gene expression viral
replication.importance: nuclear pore complexes (npcs) highly regulated
conduits nuclear membrane control transport macromolecules between
the nucleus cytoplasm. viruses replicate nucleus must negotiate
the npc nuclear entry, viral dna, mrna, proteins must be
exported nucleus. several types viruses restructure npc to
facilitate replication, current study shows adenovirus type 5 (ad5) 
utilizes novel mechanism modify npc function. demonstrate subunit 
of npc, nup205, phosphoprotein actively dephosphorylated 
ad5-encoded protein e4orf4. moreover, nup205 required ad5 regulate viral
gene expression efficient viral replication. nup205 nonstructural
subunit responsible gating functions npc, study
suggests first time npc regulated phosphorylation both
during normal physiology viral infection.
