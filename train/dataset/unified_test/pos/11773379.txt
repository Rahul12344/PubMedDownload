hormones neurotransmitters utilize cyclic amp (camp) second messenger in
signal transduction pathways regulate cell growth division,
differentiation, gene expression, metabolism. adeno-associated virus type 2
(aav-2) nonstructural protein rep78 inhibits members camp signal
transduction pathway, protein kinases pka prkx. mapped kinase
binding inhibition domain rep78 prkx amino acids (aa) 526 561
and pka aa 526 621. polypeptides potent as
full-length rep78 kinase inhibition, suggests kinase-inhibitory
domain entirely contained rep peptides. steady-state kinetic analysis
of rep78-mediated inhibition pka prkx showed rep78 appears to
increase k(m) value peptide kinase substrate, maximal
velocity reaction unaffected. indicates rep78 acts a
competitive inhibitor respect peptide kinase substrate. detected
homology cellular pseudosubstrate inhibitor pka, protein kinase 
inhibitor pki, prkx pka inhibition domains rep78. due this
homology competitive inhibition mechanism rep78, propose rep78
inhibits pka prkx kinase activity pseudosubstrate inhibition.
