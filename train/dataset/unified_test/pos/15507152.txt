background: feline leukemia virus (felv) induces degenerative, proliferative 
malignant hematologic disorders natural host, domestic cat. felv-945
is viral variant identified predominant cohort naturally infected
animals. felv-945 contains unique sequence motif long terminal repeat
(ltr) comprised single copy transcriptional enhancer followed 21-bp 
sequence triplicated tandem. ltr precisely conserved among independent 
cases multicentric lymphoma, myeloproliferative disease anemia animals 
from cohort. 21-bp triplication previously shown act a
transcriptional enhancer preferentially hematopoietic cells confer a
replicative advantage. objective present study examine the
molecular mechanism 21-bp triplication exerts influence 
selective advantage responsible precise conservation.
results: potential binding sites transcription factor, c-myb, were
identified across repeat junctions 21-bp triplication. sites
would occur absence repeat; thus, requirement c-myb
binding repeat junctions triplication would exert selective
pressure conserve sequence precisely. electrophoretic mobility shift
assays demonstrated specific binding c-myb 21-bp triplication. reporter
gene assays showed triplication-containing ltr responsive c-myb,
and responsiveness requires presence c-myb binding sites.
results indicated c-myb complex 21-bp triplication
recruits transcriptional co-activator, cbp, regulator normal
hematopoiesis. felv-945 replication shown positively regulated cbp
in manner dependent presence 21-bp triplication.
conclusion: binding sites c-myb across repeat junctions 21-bp
triplication may account precise conservation felv-945 ltr. c-myb 
binding cbp recruitment ltr positively regulated virus production, and
thus may responsible replicative advantage conferred 21-bp
triplication. considering cbp present hematopoietic cells limiting 
amounts, hypothesize felv-945 replication bone marrow may influence
cbp availability thereby alter regulation cbp-responsive genes, thus
contributing altered hematopoiesis consequent hematologic disease.
