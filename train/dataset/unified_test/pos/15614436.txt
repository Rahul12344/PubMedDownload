the x protein human hepatitis b virus (hbv) acts indirect
transcriptional transactivator regulate expression many viral and
cellular genes well playing critical role development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. biological importance hbx well
established, cellular molecular bases function remain largely
undefined. study, isolated new hbv field strain patient 
chronic viral infection. x protein encoded virus used bait
protein screening human liver cdna library using yeast two-hybrid system.
several cell proteins identified new hbx interacting partners, including 
a transmembrane serine protease, hepsin. direct interaction hbx and
hepsin proteins confirmed vitro vivo co-immunoprecipitation
assays. hbx also co-localized hepsin human cells determined by
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. interaction hbx hepsin
protein appeared play role promoting cell proliferation blocking
apoptosis human liver tumor cell normal liver cell lines. addition, the
complex hbx hepsin promoted expression hbeag hep g2.2.1.5 cells 
indicating association two proteins stimulated viral
replication.
