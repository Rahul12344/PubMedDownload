a proline-rich region (prr) within rubella virus (rubv) p150 replicase
protein contains three sh3 domain-binding motifs (pxxpxr) investigated
for ability bind cell proteins. pull-down experiments using glutathione 
s-transferase-prr fusion revealed pxxpxr motif-specific binding human p32
protein (gc1qr), could mediated either first two motifs. 
finding interest p32 protein also binds rubv capsid
protein. binding p32 p150 confirmed abolished mutation of
the first two motifs. mutations first two motifs introduced into
a rubv cdna infectious clone, virus replication significantly impaired.
however, virus rna synthesis found unaffected, subsequent
immunofluorescence analysis rubv-infected cells revealed co-localization of
p32 p150 little overlap p32 rna replication complexes, indicating
that p32 participate directly virus rna synthesis. thus, role 
p32 rubv replication remains unresolved.
