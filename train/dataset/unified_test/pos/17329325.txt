serum amyloid (saa) acute-phase protein induced variety of
inflammatory stimuli, including bacterial viral infections. saa recently 
found function opsonin gram-negative bacteria. report that
saa inhibited hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection cultured cells. saa reduced
hcv infectivity dose-dependent manner added hcv infection but
not virus entry. saa bound hcv virions specifically blocked hcv entry
but affect virus attachment. findings suggest saa functions as
part host innate immune defense mechanisms hcv infection in
humans.
