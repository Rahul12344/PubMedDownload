human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) immediate-early ie86 protein alone induces
cell cycle quiescent primary human foreskin fibroblasts (hffs), blocks its
progression g1/s interphase inhibits cellular dna synthesis a
mechanism clearly understood. assumed that, phenomenon,
the binding minichromosome maintenance (mcm) proteins replication origins
is blocked. work, analyzed initiation dna replication in
hcmv-permissive u373mg cells used orip epstein-barr virus (ebv) a
simplified model cellular replication origin. using u373mg cells found
that hcmv ie86 protein bound mcm3, inhibit cellular dna
synthesis. using u373mg-p220.2 cells carrying ebv orip expressing
epstein-barr nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1), found ebna1 well mcm3 
bound orip neither hcmv ie86 protein inhibited binding of
mcm3 orip. differences effects hcmv cell cycle
progression hffs u373mg cells discussed.keywords: cell cycle; human
cytomegalovirus; dna replication.
