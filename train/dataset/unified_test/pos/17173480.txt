to replicate, hiv-1 capitalizes endogenous cellular activation pathways
resulting recruitment key host transcription factors viral enhancer.
rna interference powerful tool blocking key checkpoints hiv-1
entry cells. apply rna interference hiv-1 transcription in
primary macrophages, major reservoir virus, specifically target 
transcription factor nfat5 (nuclear factor activated cells 5), 
most evolutionarily divergent nfat protein. molecularly cloning sequencing
isolates multiple viral subtypes, performing dnase footprinting,
electrophoretic mobility shift, promoter mutagenesis transfection assays, 
demonstrate nfat5 functionally interacts specific enhancer binding
site conserved hiv-1, hiv-2, multiple simian immunodeficiency viruses.
using small interfering rna ablate expression endogenous nfat5 protein, 
show replication three major hiv-1 viral subtypes (b, c, e) is
dependent upon nfat5 human primary differentiated macrophages. results
define novel host factor-viral enhancer interaction reveals new
regulatory role nfat5 defines functional dna motif conserved across
hiv-1 subtypes representative simian immunodeficiency viruses. inhibition 
the nfat5-ltr interaction may thus present novel therapeutic target suppress
hiv-1 replication progression aids.
