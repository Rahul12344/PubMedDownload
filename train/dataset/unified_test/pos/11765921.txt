in order clarify biological role us2 gene product herpes simplex
virus type 2 (hsv-2), hela cdna library screened yeast two-hybrid
system using us2 protein bait, several interacting proteins were
identified, including cytokeratin 18. us2 protein co-immunoprecipitated 
cytokeratin 18 hsv-2 infected cell lysates. analysis infected ora431
cells immunofluorescence showed us2 protein gave filamentous dot-like 
cytoplasmic staining pattern, co-localized cytokeratin 18. 
us2 protein expressed alone, co-localized cytokeratin 18. define
the domain interacting cytokeratin 18, deletion mutant proteins were
constructed cells transfected mutants analyzed indirect
immunofluorescence. results suggest n-terminal half us2
protein, especially region containing amino acids 42-77, important for
interaction cytokeratin 18.
