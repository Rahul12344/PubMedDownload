the vaccinia virus e3l gene product, pe3, dsrna binding protein that
prevents activation interferon-induced, dsrna-activated protein kinase,
pkr. activation pkr, results phosphorylation translation
initiation factor, eif2alpha, leads inhibition protein synthesis, a
process involved defense virus infection. e3l gene product a
conserved dsrna binding domain (drbd) carboxyl-terminal region has
been shown function vitro sequestration dsrna. utilized in
vitro binding assays yeast two-hybrid system demonstrate direct
interactions pe3 pkr. methods, demonstrate pe3 interacts
with two distinct regions pkr, amino-terminal (amino acids 1-99) located
in regulatory domain carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 367-523) located 
in catalytic domain. amino-terminal region pkr interacts pe3
contains conserved drbd, suggesting pkr form nonfunctional
heterodimers pe3, analogous seen dsrna binding proteins.
interaction pe3 amino-terminal region pkr enhanced dsrna. in
contrast, dsrna reduces interaction pe3 carboxyl-terminal region 
of pkr. competition experiments demonstrate carboxyl-terminal region 
pkr, pe3 binds, overlaps region eif2alpha the
pseudosubstrate pk3 interact, suggesting pe3 may also prevent pkr activation
by masking substrate binding domain. like pe3, amino-terminal region of
pkr also interacts carboxyl-terminal domain pkr. interactions
increase understanding mechanisms pe3 downregulates pkr. in
addition, pkr-pkr interactions observed leads us suggest novel
autoregulatory mechanism activation pkr dsrna binding the
drbd(s) induces conformational change results release amino
terminal region substrate binding domain, allowing access eif2alpha
and subsequent phosphorylation.
