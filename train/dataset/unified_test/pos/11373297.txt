the epstein-barr virus-encoded early protein, bhrf1, structural and
functional homologue anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2. accumulating 
evidence bhrf1 protects variety cell types apoptosis induced by
various external stimuli. identify specific proteins normal epithelial
cells interact bhrf1 might promote inhibit its
anti-apoptotic activity, screened yeast two-hybrid cdna library derived from
human normal foreskin keratinocytes identified cellular gene encoding human
prenylated rab acceptor 1 (hpra1). interaction hpra1 bhrf1 was
confirmed using glutathione s-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser
scanning microscopy, co-immunoprecipitation. two regions pra1, amino acids
30-53 carboxyl-terminal 21 residues, important bhrf1 interactions
and two regions bhrf1, amino acids 1-18 89-142, including bcl-2
homology domains bh4 bh1, respectively, crucial pra1 interactions.
pra1 expression interferes anti-apoptotic activity bhrf1, although
not bcl-2. results indicate pra1 interacts selectively with
bhrf1 reduce anti-apoptotic activity might play role impeding
completion virus maturation.
