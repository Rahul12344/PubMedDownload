orthoreovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (fast) proteins dedicated
cell-cell fusogens responsible multinucleated syncytium formation are
virulence determinants fusogenic reoviruses. numerous studies the
fast proteins enveloped-virus fusogens delineated steps involved in
membrane fusion pore formation, little known mechanics pore
expansion needed syncytiogenesis. report rna interference (rnai) 
knockdown annexin a1 (ax1) expression dramatically reduced reptilian
reovirus p14 measles virus f h protein-mediated pore expansion during
syncytiogenesis effect pore formation. similar effect was
obtained chelating intracellular calcium, dramatically decreased
syncytiogenesis absence detectable effects p14-induced pore
formation. coimmunoprecipitation revealed calcium-dependent interaction between
ax1 p14 measles virus f h proteins, fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer (fret) demonstrated calcium-dependent p14-ax1 interactions cellulo.
furthermore, antibody inhibition extracellular ax1 effect on
p14-induced syncytium formation impair cell-cell fusion mediated the
endogenous muscle cell fusion machinery c2c12 mouse myoblasts. ax1 can
therefore exert diverse, fusogen-specific effects cell-cell fusion,
functioning extracellular mediator differentiation-dependent membrane
fusion intracellular promoter postfusion pore expansion syncytium
formation following virus-mediated cell-cell fusion.importance: numerous
enveloped viruses nonenveloped fusogenic orthoreoviruses encode membrane
fusion proteins induce syncytium formation, linked viral
pathogenicity. considerable insights mechanisms membrane fusion 
been obtained, processes drive postfusion expansion fusion pores to
generate syncytia poorly understood. study identifies intracellular
calcium annexin a1 (ax1) key factors required efficient pore expansion
during syncytium formation mediated reptilian reovirus p14 measles
virus f h fusion protein complexes. involvement intracellular ax1 in
syncytiogenesis directly correlates requirement intracellular calcium 
in p14-ax1 interactions pore expansion membrane fusion pore
formation. first demonstration intracellular ax1 involved 
pore expansion, suggests ax1 pathway may common host cell
response needed resolve virus-induced cell-cell fusion pores.
