hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) transcriptional coactivator plays a
significant role regulation genes involved inflammation cell
survival. recently identified cellular coactivator, activating signal
cointegrator 2 (asc-2), enriched liver cancer cells associates with
many transcription factors active hepatocytes. tissue
colocalization 2 proteins, view similar regulatory
functions, led us examine whether hbx asc-2 cooperate transcriptional
activation gene expression. glutathione s-transferase (gst) pull-down assays
and mammalian 2-hybrid analysis show transactivation domain hbx
interacts c-terminal domain asc-2. fact, 2 proteins
associated ternary complex included transcriptional activator
retinoid x receptor (rxr). mechanistically, expression hbx, half-life
of asc-2 coactivator observed increase concordance observed
increase asc-2-dependent coactivation transcription. conclusion, these
results show hbx stabilizes cellular coactivator asc-2 direct
protein-protein interaction, affecting regulation genes actively
transcribed liver cancer cells.
