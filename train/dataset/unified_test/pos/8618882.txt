the epstein-barr virus-encoded protein bzlf1 member basic leucine
zipper (bzip) family transcription factors. like several members 
bzip family, transcriptional activity bzlf1 modulated retinoic acid
receptors (rars). present evidence rar alpha bzlf1 can
reciprocally repress other's transcriptional activation newly
discovered mechanism. analysis rar alpha mutants transfection studies
reveals dna binding domain sufficient inhibition bzlf1
activity. analysis bzlf1 mutants indicates coiled-coil
dimerization domain region containing transcriptional activation domain
of bzlf1 required transrepression. coimmunoprecipitation experiments
demonstrate physical interactions rar alpha bzlf1 vivo.
furthermore, glutathione s-transferase-pulldown assays reveal these
protein-protein interactions mediated coiled-coil dimerization domain 
of bzlf1 dna binding domain rar alpha. rar alpha unable to
recognize bzlf1 binding sites, rar alpha tethered dna by
forming heteromeric complex bzlf1 bound dna. tethering rars via
protein-protein interactions onto promoter dna suggest mechanism 
rars might gain additional levels transcriptional regulation.
