the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) sequence present direct repeat 
at two termini 152-kilobase viral genome inverted repeat 
the junction two unique components l s. replication, hsv-1 
genome undergoes inversion l s, producing equimolar mixture four
possible isomers. isomerization believed result recombination
triggered breakage sequence, recombinational hot spot. have
identified enzyme hela cell extracts preferentially cleaves a
sequence purified near homogeneity. microsequencing showed to
be human endonuclease g, enzyme strong preference g+c-rich
sequences. endonuclease g appears cellular enzyme can
specifically cleave sequence. endonuclease g also showed predicted
recombination properties vitro recombination assay. based these
findings, propose endonuclease g initiates sequence-mediated
inversion l components hsv-1 dna replication.
