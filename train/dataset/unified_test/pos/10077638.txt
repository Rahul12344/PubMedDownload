orf virus, member poxvirus family, produces pustular dermatitis in
sheep, goats, humans. lesions induced infection orf virus show
extensive proliferation vascular endothelial cells, dilation blood vessels 
and dermal swelling. explanation nature lesions may lie in
the discovery orf virus encodes apparent homolog mammalian
vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) family molecules. molecules
mediate endothelial cell proliferation, vascular permeability, angiogenesis, 
lymphangiogenesis via endothelial cell receptors vegfr-1 (flt1), vegfr-2
(kdr/flk1), vegfr-3 (flt4). vegf-like protein orf virus strain nz2
(orfv2-vegf) closely related primary structure vegf. study 
we examined biological activities receptor specificity orfv2-vegf 
protein. orfv2-vegf found disulfide-linked homodimer subunit
of approximately 25 kda. orfv2-vegf showed mitogenic activity bovine aortic
and human microvascular endothelial cells induced vascular permeability.
orfv2-vegf found bind induce autophosphorylation vegfr-2 was
unable bind activate vegfr-1 vegfr-3, bound newly identified
vegf165 receptor neuropilin-1. results indicate that, functional
viewpoint, orfv2-vegf indeed member vegf family molecules, 
unique, however, utilizes vegfr-2 neuropilin-1.
