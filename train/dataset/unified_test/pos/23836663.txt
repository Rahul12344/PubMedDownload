viruses evolved sophisticated strategies exploit host cell function for
their benefit. show physiologically normal oxygen levels
(normoxia) vaccinia virus (vacv) infection leads rapid stabilization of
hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1α, translocation nucleus the
activation hif-responsive genes, vascular endothelial growth factor
(vegf), glucose transporter-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1. hif-1α
stabilization mediated vacv protein c16 binds human oxygen sensing
enzyme prolyl-hydroxylase domain containing protein (phd)2 thereby inhibits
phd2-dependent hydroxylation hif-1α. binding c16 phd2 is
direct specific, ectopic expression c16 alone induces transcription of
hif-1α responsive genes. conversely, vacv strain lacking gene c16,
c16l, unable induce hif-1α stabilization. interestingly, n-terminal
region c16 predicted phd2-like structural fold lacks the
catalytic active site residues phds. induction hypoxic response by
vacv reminiscent biochemical consequences solid tumor formation, and
illustrates poxvirus strategy manipulation cellular gene expression
