herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) neurotropic virus causing vesicular oral
or genital skin lesions, meningitis diseases particularly harmful in
immunocompromised individuals. comprehensively investigate complex
interaction hsv-1 host combined two genome-scale screens for
host factors (hfs) involved virus replication. yeast two-hybrid screen for
protein interactions rna interference (rnai) screen druggable genome
small interfering rna (sirna) library confirmed existing identified novel hfs
which functionally influence hsv-1 infection. bioinformatic analyses found the
358 hfs enriched several pathways multi-protein complexes. of
particular interest identification med23 strongly anti-viral
component largely pro-viral mediator complex, links specific
transcription factors rna polymerase ii. anti-viral effect med23 on
hsv-1 replication confirmed gain-of-function gene overexpression
experiments, inhibitory effect specific hsv-1, range of
other viruses including vaccinia virus semliki forest virus unaffected
by med23 depletion. found med23 significantly upregulated expression the
type iii interferon family (ifn-λ) mrna protein level directly
interacting transcription factor irf7. synergistic effect med23
and irf7 ifn-λ induction suggests major transcription factor for
ifn-λ expression. genotypic analysis patients suffering recurrent orofacial
hsv-1 outbreaks, previously shown deficient ifn-λ secretion, found a
significant correlation single nucleotide polymorphism ifn-λ3
(il28b) promoter strongly linked hepatitis c disease treatment outcome.
this paper describes link med23 ifn-λ, provides evidence the
crucial role ifn-λ hsv-1 immune control, highlights power of
integrative genome-scale approaches identify hfs critical disease
progression outcome.
