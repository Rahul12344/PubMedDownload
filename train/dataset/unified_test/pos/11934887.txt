high risk strains human papillomavirus (hpv), hpv 16, cause human
cervical carcinoma. e6 protein hpv 16 mediates rapid degradation of
p53, although function e6 cannot completely explain
its transforming potential. previous work laboratory demonstrated that
transfection hpv 16 e6 tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-sensitive lm cell 
line protects expressing cells tnf-induced apoptosis p53-independent
manner, purpose study determine molecular mechanism
underlying protection. caspase 3 caspase 8 activation significantly
reduced e6-expressing cells, indicating e6 acts early tnf
apoptotic pathway. fact, e6 binds directly tnf r1, shown by
co-immunoprecipitation mammalian two-hybrid approaches. e6 requires 
c-terminal portion tnf r1 binding tnf r1-associated death domain, 
and tnf r1/tnf r1-associated death domain interactions decreased the
presence e6. ha-e6 also blocked cell death triggered transfection the
death domain tnf r1. together, results provide strong support a
model hpv e6 binding tnf r1 interferes formation the
death-inducing signaling complex thus transduction proapoptotic
signals. also demonstrate hpv, like several viruses, has
developed method evading tnf-mediated host immune response.
