porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) important pathogen swine, whereas
porcine circovirus type 1 (pcv1) apathogenic. analyze interactions
between pcv host, used yeast two-hybrid assay identify
cellular proteins interacting cap rep proteins pcv genotypes.
six cellular proteins found interact cap (mkrn1, gc1qr, par-4, nap1,
npm1 hsp40) three rep (znf265, tdg vg5q). interactions
were confirmed co-immunoprecipitation. investigation localisation of
the proteins immunofluorescence revealed cases limited spatial
overlapping cap, others clear co-localisation prominent
protein redistribution observed. nine cellular proteins associated
with distinct aspects viral lifecycle data likely support future
research field pcv2 pathogenesis.
