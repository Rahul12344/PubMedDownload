the innate immune system senses viral dna enters mammalian cells, in
aberrant situations self-dna, triggers type interferon production. 
present integrative approach combines quantitative proteomics, genomics
and small molecule perturbations identify genes involved pathway. we
silenced 809 candidate genes, measured response dsdna connected
resulting hits known signaling network. identified abcf1 a
critical protein associates dsdna dna-sensing components hmgb2 
and ifi204. also found cdc37 regulates stability signaling
molecule tbk1 chemical inhibition cdc37-hsp90 interaction and
several pathway regulators potently modulates innate immune response to
dna retroviral infection.
