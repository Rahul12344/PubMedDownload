originally identified essential component herpes simplex virus
immediate early (ie) gene enhancer complex, transcriptional coactivator host 
cell factor-1 (hcf-1) implicated broad range cellular regulatory
circuits. protein mediates activation multiple interactions with
transcriptional activators, coactivators, chromatin remodeling complexes.
however, mechanisms involved hcf-1-dependent transcriptional stimulation
were undefined. using minimal hcf-1-dependent promoter model
activator, varicella zoster ie62 protein, determined hcf-1 was
not required assembly rnapii basal complex, depended solely 
on ie62 conjunction cellular factor sp1. contrast, hcf-1 was
required recruitment histone methyltransferases set1 mll1
(mixed-lineage leukemia 1), leading histone h3k4 trimethylation and
transcriptional activation. similarly, varicella zoster virus lytic
infection, hcf-1, set1, mll1 recruited viral genomic ie promoter,
suggesting essential role hcf-1 chromatin modification remodeling
during initiation lytic infection. results indicate one biological
rationale incorporation viral ie activators viral particle 
is recruit hcf-1/histone methyltransferase complexes promote assembly of
the viral ie gene promoters transcriptionally active chromatin. these
studies also contribute model whereby induced nuclear transport of
hcf-1 sensory neurons may critical reactivation latent
herpesviruses promoting activation chromatin modifications.
