the ebola virus matrix protein vp40 plays important role virion formation
and viral egress cells. however, host cell proteins mechanisms
responsible intracellular transport vp40 prior contribution to
virion formation remain elucidated. therefore used coimmunoprecipitation
and mass spectrometric analyses identify host proteins interacting vp40. 
we found sec24c, component host copii vesicular transport system,
interacts specifically vp40 via vp40 amino acids 303 307.
coimmunoprecipitation dominant-negative mutant studies indicated the
copii transport system plays critical role vp40 intracellular transport to
the plasma membrane. marburg virus vp40 also shown use copii transport
system intracellular transport. findings identify conserved
intersection host pathway filovirus replication, intersection
that targeted development new antiviral drugs.
