adenoviruses infect epithelial cells lining mucous membranes cause acute
diseases people. also utilized vectors vaccination for
gene cancer therapy, well tools discover mechanisms cancer due to
their tumorigenic potential experimental animals. adenovirus e4-orf1 gene 
encodes oncoprotein promotes viral replication, cell survival, and
transformation activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k). the
mechanism activation understood, function depends complex
formed e4-orf1 membrane-associated cellular pdz protein discs
large 1 (dlg1), common viral target tumor suppressor oncogenic 
functions. here, report human epithelial cells, e4-orf1 interacts with
the regulatory catalytic subunits pi3k elevates levels. like
pi3k activation, pi3k protein elevation e4-orf1 requires dlg1. show
that dlg1, e4-orf1, pi3k form ternary complex plasma membrane. at
this site, dlg1 also co-localizes activated pi3k effector protein akt,
indicating ternary complex mediates pi3k signaling. signifying the
functional importance ternary complex, capacity e4-orf1 induce
soft agar growth focus formation cells ablated either mutation
that prevents e4-orf1 binding dlg1 pi3k inhibitor drug. results 
demonstrate e4-orf1 interacts dlg1 pi3k assemble ternary
complex e4-orf1 hijacks dlg1 oncogenic function relocate cytoplasmic
pi3k membrane constitutive activation. novel mechanism dlg1
subversion adenovirus dysregulate pi3k could used pathogenic
viruses, human papillomavirus, human t-cell leukemia virus type 1, and
influenza virus, also target dlg1 activate pi3k cells.
