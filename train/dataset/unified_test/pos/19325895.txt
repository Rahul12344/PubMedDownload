the neuronal damage characteristic hiv-1-mediated cns diseases inflicted by
hiv-1 infected brain macrophages. several steps viral replication, including
assembly budding, differ macrophages cells; likely that
cell-specific host factors mediate differences. previously defined
annexin 2 (anx2) hiv gag binding partner human monocyte-derived
macrophages (mdms) promotes proper viral assembly. anx2, calcium-dependent
membrane-binding protein aggregate phospholipid-containing lipid rafts, 
is expressed high levels macrophages, lymphocytes 293t 
cell line. here, use bimolecular fluorescence complementation 293t cell
model demonstrate anx2 hiv-1 gag interact phosphatidylinositol
(4,5) bisphosphate-containing lipid raft membrane domains gag mediates
viral assembly. furthermore, demonstrate anx2 expression 293t cells
increases gag processing hiv-1 production. data provide new evidence
that anx2, interacting gag membranes support viral assembly, 
functions late stages hiv-1 replication.
