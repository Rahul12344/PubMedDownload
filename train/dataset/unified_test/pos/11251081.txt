the c-terminal portion adenovirus e1a suppresses ras-induced metastasis and
tumorigenicity mammalian cells; however, little known mechanisms 
by occurs. simple eukaryote saccharomyces cerevisiae, ras2p,
the homolog mammalian h-ras, regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)
and cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase (camp/pka) signaling pathways to
control differentiation yeast form pseudohyphal form. when
expressed yeast, c-terminal region e1a induced pseudohyphal
differentiation, independent mapk camp/pka signaling
pathways. using yeast two-hybrid system, identified interaction between
the c-terminal region e1a yak1p, yeast dual-specificity serine/threonine
protein kinase functions negative regulator growth. e1a also
physically interacts dyrk1a dyrk1b, two mammalian homologs yak1p, and
stimulates kinase activity vitro. demonstrate yak1p is
required yeast mediate pseudohyphal differentiation induced by
ras2p-regulated signaling pathways. however, pseudohyphal differentiation induced
by c-terminal region e1a largely independent yak1p. data
suggest mammalian yak1p-related kinases may targeted e1a oncogene 
to modulate cell growth.
