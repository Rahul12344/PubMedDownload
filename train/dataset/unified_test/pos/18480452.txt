the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) tat 14-kda viral protein
that acts potent transactivator binding transactivation-responsive
region, structured rna element located 5' end hiv-1 transcripts. 
tat transactivates viral gene expression inducing phosphorylation the
c-terminal domain rna polymerase ii several tat-activated kinases 
by recruiting chromatin-remodeling complexes histone-modifying enzymes the
hiv-1 long terminal repeat. histone acetyltransferases, including p300 hgcn5,
not acetylate histones also acetylate tat lysine positions 50 51 
in arginine-rich motif. acetylated tat positions 50 51 interacts 
a specialized protein module, bromodomain, recruits novel factors 
this particular domain, p/caf swi/snf. addition its
effect transcription, tat shown involved splicing. this
study, demonstrate tat interacts cyclin-dependent kinase 13 (cdk13) 
both vivo vitro. also found cdk13 increases hiv-1 mrna splicing
and favors production doubly spliced protein nef. addition, we
demonstrate cdk13 acts possible restriction factor, its
overexpression decreases production viral proteins gag env and
subsequently suppresses virus production. using small interfering rna against
cdk13, show silencing cdk13 leads significant increase virus
production. finally, demonstrate cdk13 mediates effect splicing
through phosphorylation asf/sf2.
