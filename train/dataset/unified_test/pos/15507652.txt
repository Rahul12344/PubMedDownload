a polyomavirus mutant isolated tumor host range selection procedure (19)
has three-amino-acid deletion (delta2-4) common n terminus t
antigens. search cellular protein bound wild-type mutant 
t antigen(s), yeast two-hybrid screen mouse embryo cdna library was
carried bait wild-type small antigen (st) fused n terminally to
the dna-binding domain gal4. taz, transcriptional coactivator ww
domain pdz-binding motif (17), identified binding partner. taz bound
in vivo three antigens different apparent affinities estimated as
1:7:100 (large antigen [lt]:middle antigen [mt]:st). delta2-4 mutant t
antigens showed detectable binding. st mt host range
transformation-defective (hr-t) mutant ng59 alteration common
st/mt region (179 d-->ni) normal n terminus also failed bind taz, 
the unaltered lt bound reduced affinity compared seen a
wild-type virus infection. ww domain pdz-binding motif taz was
essential antigen binding. delta2-4 mutant defective viral dna
replication. forced overexpression taz blocked wild-type dna replication 
manner dependent binding site polyomavirus enhancer-binding
protein 2alpha. wild-type polyomavirus antigens effectively block
transactivation taz. functional significance taz interactions with
polyomavirus antigens discussed.
