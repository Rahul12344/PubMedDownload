the tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) complex viruses, genus flavivirus, cause
severe encephalitis, meningitis, and/or hemorrhagic fevers. effective interferon 
(ifn) responses critical recovery infection flaviviruses, and
the mosquito-borne flaviviruses inhibit response. however, little is
known interactions ifn signaling tbe viruses. langat virus
(lgtv), member tbe complex viruses, found highly sensitive 
to antiviral effects ifn. however, lgtv infection inhibited ifn-induced
expression reporter gene driven either ifn-alpha/beta- or
ifn-gamma-responsive promoters. indicated lgtv inhibit the
ifn-mediated jak-stat (janus kinase-signal transducer activator of
transcription) pathway signal transduction. mechanism inhibition was
due blocks phosphorylation janus kinases, jak1 tyk2, during
ifn-alpha signaling least failure jak1 phosphorylation following
ifn-gamma stimulation. determine viral protein(s) responsible, we
individually expressed nonstructural (ns) proteins examined ability
to inhibit signal transduction. expression ns5 alone inhibited stat1
phosphorylation response ifn, thus identifying ns5 potential ifn
antagonist. examination interactions ns5 cellular proteins
revealed ns5 associated ifn-alpha/beta -gamma receptor complexes.
importantly, inhibition jak-stat signaling ns5-ifn receptor interactions
were demonstrated lgtv-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells,
important target cells early virus replication. ns5 may interfere
with innate acquired immune responses virus infection, protein
may significant role viral pathogenesis.
