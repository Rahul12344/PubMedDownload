gag proteins direct process retroviral particle assembly form the
major protein constituents viral core. matrix region hiv-1 gag 
polyprotein plays critical role transport gag plasma membrane 
assembly site. recent evidence indicates gag trafficking late endosomal
compartments, including multivesicular bodies, occurs prior viral particle
budding plasma membrane. demonstrate matrix region of
hiv-1 gag interacts directly delta subunit ap-3 complex, that
this interaction plays important functional role particle assembly.
disruption interaction eliminated gag trafficking multivesicular
bodies diminished hiv particle formation. studies illuminate early
step retroviral particle assembly provide evidence trafficking of
gag late endosomes part productive particle assembly pathway.
