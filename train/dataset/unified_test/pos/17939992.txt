a preeminent phenotype infected cell protein 0 (icp0) herpes simplex
virus 1 (hsv-1) acts promiscuous transactivator. cell
lines exposed deltaicp0 mutant virus low ratios virus per cell
infection, alpha genes expressed transition beta gamma gene
expression ensue, enhanced inhibitors histone
deacetylases (hdacs). earlier studies shown icp0 interacts corest 
and displaces hdac1 corest-rest-hdac1/2 complex. hdac1 corest are
then independently translocated cytoplasm. here, test hypothesis
that icp0 blocks silencing hsv dna displacing hdac1 the
corest-rest complex. specifically, first, mapping studies led us construct a
truncated corest (corest(146-482)) transfected cells displaced hdac1 from
the corest-rest complex. second, constructed two viruses. bacs encoding the
entire hsv-1, replaced gene encoding icp0 ampr yield deltaicp0
mutant r8501. also replaced icp0 corest(146-482) yield recombinant
r8502. yield r8502 mutant virus vero, hep-2, human embryonic lung
cells exposed 0.1 pfu virus per cell 100-, 10-, 10-fold higher,
respectively, r8501 mutant virus. vero cells, yield r8502
was identical wild-type virus. conclude corest(146-482)
functionally replaced icp0 that, extension, icp0 acts block the
silencing viral dna displacing hdac1/2 corest-rest complex.
