the epstein-barr virus (ebv) latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) interacts 
tumor necrosis factor receptor (tnfr)-associated factor (traf) molecules, which
are important lmp1-mediated signaling. two domains lmp1 independently 
activate nf-kb, carboxyl-terminal activating region 1 (ctar1) ctar2. the
activation nf-kb ctar1 occurs direct interaction lmp1 the
traf molecules, whereas ctar2 interacts tnfr-associated death domain
protein (tradd) activate nf-kb c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk). a20,
which induced lmp1 nf-kb, block nf-kb activation both
domains lmp1 inhibit jnk activation ctar2. a20 also shown to
associate traf1 traf2. study, interaction lmp1 and
a20 detected increased traf2 overexpression. a20 affect
the association traf1 traf2 displace traf1 lmp1 complex.
the interaction lmp1 tradd decreased presence a20, the
lmp1-a20 association decreased tradd, suggesting a20 tradd both
interact lmp1 may compete binding. data indicate a20
alters interactions lmp1 traf molecules tradd, affecting 
the activation nf-kb, jnk, perhaps traf-mediated signaling events.
