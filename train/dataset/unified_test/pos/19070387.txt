background/aims: hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) implicated a
potential trigger epigenetic deregulation genes, the
underlying mechanisms remain unknown. aim study identify
underlying mechanisms involved hbx-mediated epigenetic modification.
methods: interactions hbx dna methyltransferase (dnmt) histone
deacetylase-1 (hdac1) assessed co-immunoprecipitation. dna methylation of
gene promoters detected bisulfite sequencing, hbx-mediated protein
binding gene regulatory elements evaluated chromatin
immunoprecipitation. target gene transcriptional activity measured by
real-time polymerase chain reaction.
results: hbx interact directly dnmt3a hdac1. hbx recruited dnmt3a to
the regulatory promoters interleukin-4 receptor metallothionein-1f and
subsequently silenced transcription via de novo dna methylation. by
contrast, transcription cdh6 igfbp3 triggered hbx the
deprivation dnmt3a promoters. transcriptional levels target
genes hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) specimens strongly correlated with
the occurrence hbx.
conclusions: interaction hbx dnmt3a facilitates cellular epigenetic
modification (via regional hypermethylation hypomethylation) distinct
genomic loci, providing alternative mechanism within hbx-mediated
transcriptional regulation, profound understanding hepatitis hcc
pathogenesis.
