the pppy motif matrix (ma) domain human t-cell leukemia virus type 1
(htlv-1) gag associates wwp1, member hect domain containing family 
of e3 ubiquitin ligases. mutation pppy motif arrests particle assembly 
an early stage abolishes ubiquitination ma. similar effects seen 
gag expressed presence truncated form wwp1 lacks the
catalytically active hect domain (c2ww). understand role ubiquitination
in budding, mutated four lysines arginines identified lysine 
74 unique site ubiquitination. virus-like particles produced the
k74r mutant contain ubiquitinated showed fourfold reduction in
the release infectious particles. furthermore, k74r mutation rendered
assembly hypersensitive c2ww inhibition; k74r gag budding inhibited at
significantly lower levels expression c2ww compared wild-type gag.
this finding indicates interaction gag wwp1 required 
functions gag ubiquitination. additionally, show pppy(-)
mutant gag exerts strong dominant-negative effect budding wild-type
gag, supporting importance recruitment wwp1 achieve particle
assembly.
