hiv-1 integrase (in) virally encoded protein required integration of
viral cdna host chromosomes. ini1/hsnf5 component swi/snf
complex interacts hiv-1 in, selectively incorporated hiv-1 (but
not retroviral) virions, modulates multiple steps, including particle
production infectivity. gain insight role ini1 in
hiv-1 replication, screened ini1-interacting proteins using yeast
two-hybrid system. found sap18 (sin3a associated protein 18 kd), a
component sin3a-hdac1 complex, directly binds ini1 yeast, vitro
and vivo. interestingly, found also binds sap18 vitro 
vivo. sap18 components sin3a-hdac1 complex specifically
incorporated hiv-1 (but siv htlv-1) virions hiv-1 in-dependent
manner. using fluorescence-based assay, found hiv-1 (but siv)
virion preparations harbour significant deacetylase activity, indicating the
specific recruitment catalytically active hdac virions. determine 
the requirement virion-associated hdac1 hiv-1 replication, inactive,
transdominant negative mutant hdac1 (hdac1(h141a)) utilized. incorporation
of hdac1(h141a) decreased virion-associated histone deacetylase activity.
furthermore, incorporation hdac1(h141a) decreased infectivity hiv-1
(but siv) virions. block infectivity due virion-associated
hdac1(h141a) occurred specifically early reverse transcription stage,
while entry virions unaffected. rna-interference mediated knock-down
of hdac1 producer cells resulted decreased virion-associated hdac1 activity
and reduction infectivity virions. studies indicate that
hiv-1 ini1/hsnf5 bind sap18 selectively recruit components of
sin3a-hdac1 complex hiv-1 virions. furthermore, hiv-1 virion-associated
hdac1 required efficient early post-entry events, indicating novel role 
for hdac1 hiv-1 replication.
