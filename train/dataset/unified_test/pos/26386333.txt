cytoplasmic processing bodies (p bodies), rna-protein aggregation foci of
translationally stalled potentially decaying mrna, reported be
differentially modulated viruses. rotavirus, causative agent acute
infantile gastroenteritis double stranded rna virus completes its
entire life-cycle exclusively host cell cytoplasm. study, fate 
p bodies investigated upon rotavirus infection. found p bodies
get disrupted rotavirus infection. disruption occurred than
one different mechanism deadenylating p body component pan3 degraded by
rotavirus nsp1 exonuclease xrn1 along decapping enzyme hdcp1a were
relocalized cytoplasm nucleus. overall study highlights decay and
subcellular relocalization p body components novel mechanisms which
rotavirus subverts cellular antiviral responses.
