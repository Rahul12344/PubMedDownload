the snf2-related cbp activator protein, srcap (pronounced "sir cap"), shares
homology snf2/swi2 protein family. srcap cloned ability 
to bind cbp. srcap function cbp coactivator activate
transcription reporter assay expressed gal-srcap fusion protein. a
monoclonal antibody raised carboxyl terminus srcap
coimmunoprecipitates cbp/p300, supporting model srcap cbp binding
protein proteins found together cellular protein
complex. addition, several cellular proteins coimmunoprecipitated the
srcap-specific antibody. since adenovirus e1a proteins interact cbp/p300
proteins, examined proteins could copurified srcap-specific
coimmunoprecipitation assay lysates adenovirus-infected cells. e1a 
proteins detected complex, surprise, observed the
presence infected-cell-specific band 72 kda, suspected might be
the adenovirus dna binding protein, dbp. adenovirus dbp multifunctional 
protein involved several aspects adenovirus life cycle, including an
ability modulate transcription. identity dbp confirmed by
dbp-specific western blot analysis reimmunoprecipitating dbp from
denatured srcap-specific protein complexes. using vitro-translated dbp and
srcap proteins, demonstrated proteins interact. determine
whether interaction could affect srcap-mediated transcription, tested
whether increasing amounts dbp could modulate gal-srcap transcription
activity. observed dbp inhibited gal-srcap transcription activity a
dose-dependent manner. data suggest novel mechanism adenovirus host
cell control dbp binds inactivates srcap, member snf2
chromatin-remodeling protein family.
