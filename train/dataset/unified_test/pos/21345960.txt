poliovirus proteins 3a 3ab small, membrane-binding proteins play
multiple roles viral rna replication complex formation function. the
infected cell, proteins associate viral cellular proteins as
part supramolecular complex whose structure composition unknown. 
isolated viable viruses three different epitope tags (flag, hemagglutinin
[ha], c-myc) inserted n-terminal region protein 3a. viruses
exhibited growth properties characteristics similar the
wild-type, untagged virus. extracts prepared infected cells were
subjected immunoaffinity purification tagged proteins adsorption 
commercial antibody-linked beads examined elution cellular and
other viral proteins remained bound 3a sequences purification.
viral proteins 2c, 2bc, 3d, 3cd detected three immunopurified 3a 
samples. among cellular proteins previously reported interact 3a
either directly indirectly, neither lis1 phosphoinositol-4 kinase (pi4k)
were detected purified tagged 3a samples. however, guanine
nucleotide exchange factor gbf1, key regulator membrane trafficking
in cellular protein secretory pathway shown previously 
bind enteroviral protein 3a required viral rna replication, was
readily recovered along immunoaffinity-purified 3a-flag. surprisingly, we
failed cocapture gbf1 3a-ha 3a-myc proteins. model variable
binding 3a mutant proteins gbf1 based amino acid sequence motifs
and resulting practical functional consequences thereof discussed.
