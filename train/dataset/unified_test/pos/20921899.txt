background: coreceptor switching ccr5 cxcr4 less common subtype c
hiv-1 infection subtype b reasons unclear. examined 
sequential virus samples subtype c-infected child evidence of
coreceptor switching.
methods: examine hiv-1 envelope evolution towards cxcr4 usage, env sequences
were correlated phenotypic characteristics determined entry assays, as
well ability use alternative coreceptors fprl1, ccr3, ccr8 
others. value phenotype predictor based v3 sequences also
assessed.
results: ninety-three sequences revealed 3 distinct coexistent virus lineages and
only members one lineage evolved use cxcr4. lineages also had
diverse alternative coreceptor patterns including ability use fprl1, ccr3,
ccr8, apj, cmklr1, rdc-1, cxcr6, ccr1, gpcr1, gpr15 ccr6. coreceptor
switching associated extensive rapid sequence divergence the
v1/v2 region addition v3 changes. furthermore, interlineage recombination
within c2 region resulted low predictability v3 sequence-based
phenotype algorithm, highlighted importance v1/v2 v3 sequences 
coreceptor usage.
conclusion: results suggest evolution coreceptor switching in
subtype c infection requires mutations subtypes, this
contributes reduced incidence r5x4 viruses.
