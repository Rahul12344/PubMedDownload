like alphaherpesvirinae subfamily members, bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv-1)
establishes latency sensory neurons. latency-related rna (lr-rna) is
abundantly expressed latently infected sensory neurons. lr mutant virus
with stop codons amino terminus first open reading frame (orf) in
the lr gene (orf2) reactivate latency, part induces
higher levels apoptosis infected neurons. orf2 viral
product expressed latency, important latency
reactivation cycle inhibits apoptosis. study, yeast 2-hybrid
screen revealed orf2 interacted two cellular transcription factors,
notch1 notch3. interactions confirmed mouse neuroblastoma cells
by confocal microscopy vitro "pulldown" assay. reactivation
from latency, notch3 rna levels trigeminal ganglia higher those
during latency, suggesting notch family members promote reactivation from
latency reactivation promotes notch expression. plasmid expressing 
notch1 intercellular domain (icd) stimulated productive infection promoters
that encode viral transcription factor bicp0. notch3 icd not
stimulate productive infection efficiently notch1 icd effect
on bicp0 promoter activity. plasmids expressing notch1 icd notch3 icd 
trans-activated late promoter encoding glycoprotein c. orf2 reduced the
trans-activation potential notch1 notch3, suggesting orf2 interfered 
with trans-activation potential notch. studies provide evidence that
orf2, addition inhibiting apoptosis, potential promote
establishment maintenance latency sequestering cellular transcription
factors.
