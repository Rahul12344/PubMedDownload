epstein-barr virus (ebv) productive replication occurs s-phase-like
cellular environment high cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity. ebv
protein kinase (pk), encoded viral bglf4 gene, ser/thr protein
kinase, phosphorylates viral cellular proteins, modifying the
cellular environment efficient viral productive replication. provide 
evidence ebv pk phosphorylates cdk inhibitor p27(kip1), resulting in
ubiquitination degradation proteasome-dependent manner ebv
productive replication. experiments bglf4 knockdown small interfering rna
and bglf4 knock-out viruses clarified ebv pk involved p27(kip1)
degradation upon lytic replication. transfection bglf4 expression vector
revealed ebv pk alone could phosphorylate thr-187 residue p27(kip1)
and ubiquitination degradation p27(kip1) occurred scf(skp2)
ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner. vitro, ebv pk proved capable of
phosphorylating p27(kip1) thr-187. unlike cyclin e-cdk2 activity, ebv pk
activity inhibited p27(kip1). overall, ebv pk enhances p27(kip1)
degradation effectively upon ebv productive replication, contributing to
establishment s-phase-like cellular environment high cdk activity.
