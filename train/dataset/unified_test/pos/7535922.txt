hiv-1 reverse transcriptase dimeric enzyme mainly involved the
replication viral genome. filamentous phage cdna expression library from
human lymphocytes used select cellular proteins interacting hiv-1
reverse transcriptase affinity selections using bacterially expressed
monomeric large subunit reverse transcriptase (p66) yielded host beta-actin.
this clone expressed glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein was
identified using specific antibody beta-actin. furthermore show
that also eukaryotic beta-actin binds either large subunit reverse 
transcriptase pol precursor polyprotein vitro. reverse
transcriptase/beta-actin interaction might important secretion of
hiv-1 virions.
