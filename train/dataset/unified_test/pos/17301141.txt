like positive-strand rna viruses, hepatitis c virus (hcv) believed to
replicate genome surface rearranged membranes. shown
previously hcv ns4ab, product ns4b, inhibits endoplasmic
reticulum (er)-to-golgi protein traffic (k. v. konan, t. h. giddings, jr., m.
ikeda, k. li, s. m. lemon, k. kirkegaard, j. virol. 77:7843-7855). however,
both ns4ab ns4b induce "membranous web" formation, first reported by
egger et al. (d. b egger, r. gosert, l. bianchi, h. e. blum, d. moradpour, k.
bienz, j. virol. 76:5974-5984), also observed hcv-infected cells (y. 
rouille, f. helle, d. delgrange, p. roingeard, c. voisset, e. blanchard, s.
belouzard, j. mckeating, a. h. patel, g. maertens, t. wakita, c. wychowski, and
j. dubuisson, j. virol. 80:2832-2841) cells bear subgenomic ns5a-green
fluorescent protein (gfp) replicon (d. moradpour, m. j. evans, r. gosert, z.
yuan, h. e. blum, s. p. goff, b. d. lindenbach, c. m. rice, j. virol.
78:7400-7409). determine intracellular origin web, examined ns4b
colocalization endogenous cellular markers context full-length
or subgenomic replicon. found that, addition er markers, early endosome 
(ee) proteins, including rab5, associated web-inducing protein ns4b.
furthermore, immunoisolated fraction containing ns4b found contain both
er ee proteins. using fluorescence microscopy, showed wild-type and
constitutively active rab5 proteins associated ns4b. interestingly,
expression dominant-negative rab5 resulted significant loss gfp
fluorescence ns5a-gfp replicon cells. also found small reduction 
rab5 protein expression decreased hcv rna synthesis significantly. furthermore,
transfection labeled rab5 small interfering rnas ns5a-gfp replicon cells 
resulted significant decrease gfp fluorescence. finally, rab5 protein was
found coimmunoprecipitate hcv ns4b. studies suggest ee
proteins, including rab5, may play role hcv genome replication web
formation.
