enterovirus 71 (ev71) associated severe neurological disorders in
children, implicated infectious agent several large-scale 
outbreaks mortalities. upon infection, viral rna translated a
cap-independent manner yield large polyprotein precursor. mechanism
relies presence internal ribosome entry site (ires) element within
the 5'-untranslated region. virus-host interactions ev71-infected cells are
crucial assisting process. identified novel positive ires
trans-acting factor, far upstream element binding protein 1 (fbp1). using binding
assays, mapped rna determinants within ev71 ires responsible fbp1 
binding mapped protein domains involved interaction. also
demonstrated ev71 infection, nuclear protein fbp1 enriched 
cytoplasm viral replication occurs. moreover, showed fbp1 acts a
positive regulator ev71 replication competing negative itaf ev71
ires binding. new findings may provide route new anti-viral therapy.
