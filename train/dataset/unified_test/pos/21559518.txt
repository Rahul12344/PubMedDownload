background: cyclosporin (csa) well known immunosuppressive drug useful
for allogeneic transplantation. reported csa inhibits hepatitis 
c virus (hcv) genome replication, indicates cellular targets csa
regulate viral replication. however, regulation mechanisms hcv
replication governed csa target proteins fully understood.
principal findings: show chemical biology approach elucidates a
novel mechanism hcv replication. developed phage display screening to
investigate compound-peptide interaction identified novel cellular target
molecule csa. protein, named csa associated helicase-like protein (cahl),
possessed rna-dependent atpase activity negated treatment csa.
the downregulation cahl cells resulted decrease hcv genome
replication. cahl formed complex hcv-derived rna polymerase ns5b and
host-derived cyclophilin b (cypb), known cellular cofactor hcv
replication, regulate ns5b-cypb interaction.
conclusions: found cellular factor, cahl, csa associated helicase-like
protein, would form trimer complex cypb ns5b hcv. strategy 
using chemical compound identifying target molecule phage
display analysis useful reveal novel mechanism underlying cellular and
viral physiology.
