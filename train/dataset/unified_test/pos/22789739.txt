human phospholipid scramblase (plscr) 1 expression strongly activated in
response interferon (ifn) treatment viral infection, plscr1 is
necessary ifn-dependent induction gene expression antiviral
activity. show plscr1 directly interacts human t-cell leukemia 
virus type-1 (htlv-1) tax vitro vivo. interaction reduced the
cytoplasmic distribution tax. plscr1 efficiently repressed tax-mediated
transactivation htlv-1 long terminal repeat nf-κb binding site
reporter constructs interaction-dependent manner cos-1 tax-producing
htlv-1-infected cell lines. furthermore, show plscr1 repressed the
homodimerization tax vitro. data reveal first time that
plscr1 specifically interacts htlv-1 tax negatively regulates its
transactivation activity altering subcellular distribution the
homodimerization tax. plscr1 may play important role ifn-mediated
repression tax-dependent transactivation htlv-1 infection.
