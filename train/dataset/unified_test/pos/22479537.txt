background: human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) uracil dna glycosylase, ul114, is
required efficient viral dna replication. presumably, ul114 functions a
structural partner factors dna-replication machinery a
dna repair protein. ul114 binds ul44 (hcmv processivity factor) ul54
(hcmv-dna-polymerase). present study searched cellular
partners ul114.
methodology/principal findings: yeast two-hybrid screen smarcb1, factor of
the swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex, found interacting partner 
of ul114. interaction confirmed vitro co-immunoprecipitation and
pull-down. immunofluorescence microscopy revealed smarcb1 along brg-1, 
baf170 baf155, core swi/snf components required efficient
chromatin remodeling, present virus replication foci 24-48 hours post
infection (hpi). furthermore direct interaction also demonstrated for
smarcb1 ul44.
conclusions/significance: core swi/snf factors required efficient
chromatin remodeling present hcmv replication foci throughout
infection. proteins ul44 ul114 interact smarcb1 may participate 
in recruitment swi/snf complex chromatinized virus dna. thus,
the presence swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex replication foci 
its association ul114 ul44 might imply involvement different
dna transactions.
