the inhibitory properties phosphorylated cystatin alpha (p-cystatin alpha) and
a conjugated protein p-cystatin alpha filaggrin linker segment
peptide (flsp) growth staphylococcus bacteria poliovirus 
investigated. p-cystatin alpha conjugated protein (p-cystatin
alpha-flsp conjugate) model cornified envelope skin inhibited the
cysteine protease activity staphylococcus aureus v8. protease activity was
inhibited normal cornified envelope newborn rat skin, contains
p-cystatin alpha, p-cystatin alpha cornified envelope newborn rat skin 
also suppressed growth s. aureus v8. p-cystatin alpha p-cystatin
alpha-flsp conjugate added cultured hela cells infected poliovirus,
50-70% cell-death due poliovirus infection prevented. the
poliovirus 3c protease activity infected hela cells inhibited by
p-cystatin alpha p-cystatin alpha-flsp conjugate. result, processing 
of viral capsid peptides suppressed. findings suggest p-cystatin
alpha p-cystatin alpha-flsp conjugate could play role barrier
against microorganism infections due inhibition cysteine protease
activities.
