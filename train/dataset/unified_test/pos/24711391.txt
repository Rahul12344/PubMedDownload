the trimeric moloney murine leukemia virus env protein matures two proteolytic
cleavages. first, furin cleaves env precursor surface (su) and
transmembrane (tm) subunits cell viral protease cleaves the
r-peptide tm new virus. analyzed structure furin
precursor, cryoelectron microscopy. transfected 293t cells furin
cleavage site provirus mutant, r466g/k468g, produced virus the
presence amprenavir also inhibit r-peptide cleavage. although env
incorporation particles inhibited, enough precursor could isolated
and analyzed cryoelectron microscopy yield 3d structure 22 å
resolution. showed open cage-like structure like r-peptide
precursor mature env described before. however, middle protrusion 
the protomeric unit, prominently pointing side mature
forms env, absent. instead, extra density top
protrusion. suggested c-terminal su domain associated alongside
the receptor binding n-terminal su domain furin precursor. was
supported mapping su c-terminal domain-specific antigen binding
fragment. concluded furin cleavage separates subunits and
liberates fusion peptide end tm also allows c-terminal
domain relocate peripheral position. conformational change might
explain c-terminal domain su gains potential undergo disulfide 
isomerization, event facilitates membrane fusion.
