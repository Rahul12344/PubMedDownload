the epstein-barr virus (ebv) genome maintained extrachromosomal episome 
during latent infection b lymphocytes. episomal maintenance conferred by
the interaction ebv-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1) tandem array 
of high-affinity binding sites, referred family repeats (fr),
located within viral origin plasmid replication (orip). this
nucleoprotein array confers episomal maintenance completely understood.
previous studies shown dna replication forks pause terminate with
high frequency orip. show cellular dna replication fork pausing
and protection factors timeless (tim) tipin (timeless-interacting protein)
accumulate orip phase cell cycle. depletion tim inhibits
orip-dependent dna replication causes complete loss closed-circular 
form ebv episomes latently infected b lymphocytes. tim depletion also led
to accumulation double-strand breaks orip region. findings
demonstrate tim essential sustaining episomal forms ebv dna in
latently infected cells suggest dna replication fork protection is
integrally linked mechanism plasmid maintenance.
