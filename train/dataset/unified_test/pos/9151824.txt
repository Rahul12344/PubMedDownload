the myxoma virus t7 protein m-t7 functional soluble gamma interferon
receptor homolog previously shown bind gamma interferon and
inhibit antiviral activities species-specific manner, gene knockout 
analysis suggested role m-t7 blocking leukocyte influx 
infected lesions. purified m-t7 apparent homogeneity showed m-t7
is n-linked glycoprotein appears stable homotrimer a
molecular mass approximately 113 kda solution. m-t7, addition forming
inhibitory complexes rabbit gamma interferon, also shown bind to
human interleukin-8, prototypic member chemokine superfamily. moreover, 
m-t7 able interact promiscuously members cxc, cc, c
chemokine subfamilies tested. binding human rantes m-t7 competed 
rabbit gamma interferon also cold rantes competitor 50% inhibitory 
concentration 900 nm. although m-t7 retains binding number of
interleukin-8 n-terminal (elr) deletion mutants, binding mutants containing
deletions c-terminal heparin-binding domain interleukin-8 abrogated.
furthermore, heparin effectively competes interaction m-t7 the
chemokine rantes rabbit gamma interferon. propose novel
m-t7 interaction members chemokine superfamily may facilitated
through conserved heparin-binding domains found wide spectrum of
chemokines m-t7 may function modulating chemokine-glycosaminoglycan
interactions virus-infected tissues.
