we previously reported cellular protein zeb1 repress expression of
the epstein-barr virus (ebv) bzlf1 gene transient transfection assays by
directly binding promoter, zp. also reported ebv containing 2-bp
substitution mutation zeb-binding zv element zp spontaneously
reactivated latency lytic replication higher frequency 
wild-type ebv. here, using small interfering rna (sirna) short hairpin rna
(shrna) technologies, definitively show zeb1 is, indeed, key player 
maintaining ebv latency epithelial b-lymphocytic cell lines. however,
in ebv-positive epithelial b-cell lines, another zinc finger
e-box-binding protein, zeb2/sip1, key player. zeb1 zeb2 bind 
zp via zv element. ebv-positive cells containing zeb1, knockdown of
zeb1 led viral reactivation latency, synthesis ebv
immediate-early early lytic gene products. however, ebv-positive cells
containing zebs, zeb2, zeb1, primary zeb family member bound 
zp. knockdown zeb2, zeb1, led ebv lytic reactivation. thus, we
conclude either zeb1 zeb2 play central role maintenance of
ebv latency, cell-type-dependent manner.
