the negative-sense rna genome influenza virus transcribed replicated 
by viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp). viral rdrp important 
host range determinant, indicating function affected interactions 
with cellular factors. however, identities roles these
factors remain unknown. here, employed affinity purification followed mass 
spectrometry identify cellular proteins interact influenza a
virus rdrp infected human cells. purified rdrps using recombinant
influenza virus pb2 subunit rdrp fused strep-tag.
when tagged subunit purified infected cells, copurifying proteins
included rdrp subunits (pb1 pa) viral nucleoprotein and
neuraminidase, well 171 cellular proteins. label-free quantitative mass
spectrometry revealed abundant host proteins were
chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins, importins, proteins involved in
ubiquitination, kinases phosphatases, mitochondrial ribosomal
proteins. among phosphatases, identified three subunits cellular
serine/threonine protein phosphatase 6 (pp6), including catalytic subunit
ppp6c regulatory subunits ppp6r1 ppp6r3. pp6 found interact
directly pb1 pb2 subunits viral rdrp, small interfering
rna (sirna)-mediated knockdown catalytic subunit pp6 infected cells 
resulted reduction viral rna accumulation attenuation virus 
growth. results suggest pp6 interacts positively regulates
the activity influenza virus rdrp.importance: influenza viruses are
serious clinical veterinary pathogens, causing substantial health and
economic impacts. addition annual seasonal epidemics, occasional global
pandemics occur viral strains adapt humans species. to
replicate efficiently cause disease, influenza viruses must interact a
large number host factors. reliance viral rna-dependent rna
polymerase (rdrp) host factors makes major host range determinant. this
study describes quantifies host proteins interact, directly or
indirectly, subunit rdrp. increases understanding the
role host proteins viral replication identifies large number of
potential barriers pandemic emergence. identifying host factors allows their
importance viral replication tested. here, demonstrate role for
the cellular phosphatase pp6 promoting viral replication, contributing 
emerging knowledge regulatory phosphorylation influenza virus biology.
