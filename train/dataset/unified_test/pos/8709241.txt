protein shown associate serine-threonine kinase recognizes
histone h4 substrate, serologically related rat p21-activated kinase
(pak), specifically activated rac cdc42. characteristics
define nef-associated kinase belonging pak family. paks initiate
kinase cascades response environmental stimuli, identification as
a target nef implicates signaling molecules hiv pathogenesis and
provides novel target clinical intervention.
