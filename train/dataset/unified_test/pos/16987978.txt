epstein-barr virus (ebv) establishes persistent infection human host and
is associated variety human cancers. persistent infection results 
a balance host immune response viral immune evasion mechanisms.
ebv infection controlled initially innate immune response later 
t-cell-mediated adaptive immunity. ebv evolved mechanisms evade host
immune response persist lifetime host. latent
membrane protein 1 (lmp-1) ebv oncoprotein essential b-cell
immortalization ebv. show lmp-1 interacts tyk2, signaling 
intermediate alpha interferon (ifn-alpha) signaling pathway, via a
previously uncharacterized lmp-1 signaling domain. lmp-1 prevents tyk2
phosphorylation inhibits ifn-alpha-stimulated stat2 nuclear translocation and
interferon-stimulated response element transcriptional activity. long-term
culture ebv+ lymphoblastoid cells ifn-alpha associated outgrowth of
a population expressing elevated lmp-1 protein levels, suggesting cells
expressing higher levels lmp-1 survive antiproliferative selective
pressure imposed ifn-alpha. results show lmp-1 protect ebv+
cells ifn-alpha-stimulated antiviral/antiproliferative response and
suggest chronic ifn-alpha treatment may encourage outgrowth cells
expressing elevated, therefore potentially oncogenic, lmp-1 levels ebv+
individuals.
