jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (jsrv) induce rapid, multifocal lung cancer, 
jsrv simple retrovirus known oncogenes. show the
envelope (env) gene jsrv unusual property induce
transformation rat fibroblasts, thus likely responsible for
oncogenesis animals. retrovirus entry cells mediated env
interaction particular cell-surface receptors, used phenotypic
screening radiation hybrid cell lines identify candidate lung cancer
tumor suppressor hyal2/luca2 receptor jsrv. hyal2 previously
described lysosomal hyaluronidase, show hyal2 actually a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored cell-surface protein. furthermore, we
could detect hyaluronidase activity associated secreted cells
expressing hyal2, whereas could easily detect activity cells
expressing related serum hyaluronidase hyal1. although function hyal2 
is currently unknown, gpi-anchored proteins involved signal
transduction, mediate mitogenic responses, suggesting potential role
of hyal2 jsrv env-mediated oncogenesis. lung cancer induced jsrv closely
resembles human bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma, disease increasing in
frequency accounts approximately 25% lung cancer. finding 
that jsrv env oncogenic identification hyal2 jsrv receptor
provide tools investigation mechanism jsrv oncogenesis 
its relationship human bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma.
