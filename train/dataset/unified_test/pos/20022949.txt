nitric oxide implicated pathogenesis inflammatory disorders,
including hepatitis b virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. transactivator
protein hbx, major regulator cellular responses hepatitis b virus, is
known induce expression mta1 (metastasis-associated protein 1)
coregulator via nf-kappab signaling hepatic cells. however, underlying
mechanism hbx regulation inducible nitric-oxide synthase (inos) pathway
remains unknown. provide evidence mta1 positive regulator of
inos transcription plays mechanistic role hbx stimulation inos
expression activity. found hbx-mta1 complex recruited onto the
human inos promoter nf-kappab-dependent manner. pharmacological inhibition 
of nf-kappab signaling prevented ability hbx stimulate the
transcription, expression, activity inos; nevertheless, these
effects could substantially rescued mta1 dysregulation. further
discovered hbx-mediated stimulation mta1 paralleled suppression
of mir-661, member small noncoding rnas, recently shown target mta1. 
we observed mir-661 controls mta1 expression contributed the
expression activity inos hbx-expressing hepg2 cells. accordingly,
depletion mta1 either mir-661 sirna hbx-expressing cells severely
impaired ability hbx modulate endogenous levels inos nitrite
production. together, findings reveal inherent role mta1 hbx
regulation inos expression consequently function liver cancer
cells.
