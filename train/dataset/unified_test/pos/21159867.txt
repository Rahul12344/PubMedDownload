endoplasmic reticulum (er)-to-cytosol membrane transport decisive infection 
step murine polyomavirus (py). previously determined erp29, a
protein disulfide isomerase (pdi) member, extrudes py vp1 c-terminal arm to
initiate er membrane penetration. reaction requires disruption py's
disulfide bonds. here, found pdi family members erp57, pdi, erp72
facilitate virus infection. however, three proteins disrupt py's
disulfide bonds vitro, erp57 pdi operate concert erp29 to
unfold vp1 c-terminal arm. alkylated py cannot stimulate infection,
implying pivotal role viral free cysteines infection. consistent with
this, found although pdi erp72 reduce py, erp57 principally
isomerizes virus vitro, reaction requires viral free cysteines. our
mutagenesis study subsequently identified vp1 c11 c15 important for
infection, suggesting role residues isomerization. c11 c15
also act together stabilize interpentamer interactions subset the
virus pentamers, likely residues form interpentamer
disulfide bonds. study reveals pdi family functions coordinately and
distinctly promote py infection pinpoints role viral cysteines in
this process.
