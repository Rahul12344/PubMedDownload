to identify cellular processes involved retroviral infection, employed a
high-volume forward genetic screen insertionally mutagenized somatic cells
using murine leukemia virus (mlv) vector. approach identified clonal
cell line exhibited approximately 10-fold reduced gene expression mlv
vectors following infection despite supporting normal levels mlv reverse
transcription integration. defect cell line specific 
mlv long terminal repeat (ltr) promoter, normal levels reporter gene
expression obtained internal cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter
contained within ltr-defective mlv vector ltr expression avian
sarcoma leukosis virus (aslv) vector. complementation shrna knockdown
experiments demonstrated defective gene cells zasc1
(znf639), transcription factor strong links cancer inherited
ataxias. demonstrated zasc1 sequence-specific dna binding protein
with three closely related binding sites located within mlv ltr promoter, but
it bind aslv promoter. mutating putative zasc1 binding
sites significantly reduced levels mlv gene expression. wild-type zasc1 
activated expression mlv promoter, green fluorescent protein-zasc1
fusion protein showed dominant-negative inhibition mlv gene expression. 
studies identify cellular transcription factor zasc1 activator mlv
gene expression provide tools useful studying links
between zasc1 human diseases.
