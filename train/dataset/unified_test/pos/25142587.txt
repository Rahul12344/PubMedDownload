the serine-arginine-specific protein kinase srpk1 common binding partner 
the e1^e4 protein diverse human papillomavirus types. show the
first time interaction hpv1 e1^e4 srpk1 leads potent
inhibition srpk1 phosphorylation host serine-arginine (sr) proteins that
have critical roles mrna metabolism, including pre-mrna processing, mrna
export, translation. furthermore, show srpk1 phosphorylates serine
residues sr/rs dipeptides hinge region hpv1 e2 protein in
vitro kinase assays hpv1 e1^e4 inhibits phosphorylation. after
mutation putative phosphoacceptor serine residues, localization the
e2 protein altered primary human keratinocytes; significant
increase cell population showing intense e2 staining nucleolus. a
similar effect observed following coexpression e2 e1^e4 is
competent inhibition srpk1 activity, suggesting nuclear
localization e2 sensitive e1^e4-mediated srpk1 inhibition. collectively,
these data suggest e1^e4-mediated inhibition srpk1 could affect the
functions host sr proteins virus transcription/replication
regulator e2. speculate novel e4 function identified involved
in regulation e2 sr protein function posttranscriptional processing
of viral transcripts.importance: hpv life cycle tightly linked the
epithelial terminal differentiation program, virion-producing phase
restricted differentiating cells. abundant hpv protein
expressed phase e4 protein, fully understand role of
this protein. e4 interaction partners identified, had
previously shown e4 proteins diverse papillomaviruses interact the
serine-arginine-specific protein kinase srpk1, kinase important the
replication cycles diverse range dna rna viruses. show hpv1
e4 potent inhibitor host cell kinase. show e4 inhibits srpk1
phosphorylation, cellular sr proteins involved regulating
alternative splicing rna also viral transcription/replication
regulator e2. findings reveal potential e4 function regulation viral 
late gene expression inhibition host cell kinase.
