in yeast two-hybrid screen cellular factors could interact human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gag protein, identified pdzd8 and
confirmed interaction coimmunoprecipitation (co-ip). pdzd8 overexpression 
promoted initiation reverse transcription increased infection by
pseudotyped retroviruses independent route viral entry, transient
knockdown endogenous levels decreased hiv-1 infection. mutant pdzd8
lacking predicted coiled-coil domain gag-interacting region failed to
bind gag promote hiv-1 infection, identifying domain pdzd8 required
for mediating effects. such, identify pdzd8 novel positive
mediator retroviral infection.
