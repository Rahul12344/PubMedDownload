previous studies suggest core protein hepatitis c virus (hcv) a
pleiotropic function replication cycle virus. understand the
role protein hcv pathogenesis, used yeast two-hybrid protein
interaction cloning system search cellular proteins physically interacting
with hcv core protein. one cellular gene isolated characterized 
as gene encoding lymphotoxin-beta receptor (lt-betar). vitro binding
analysis demonstrated hcv core protein binds c-terminal 98 amino 
acids within intracellular domain lt-betar involved signal 
transduction, although binding affinity full-length hcv core protein
was weaker c-terminally truncated form. results also
indicated n-terminal 40-amino-acid segment hcv core protein was
sufficient interaction lt-betar core protein could form
complexes oligomeric form intracellular domain lt-betar, which
is prerequisite downstream signaling receptor. similar other
members tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor superfamily, lt-betar is
involved cytotoxic effect signaling pathway, thus have
elucidated biological consequence interaction hcv core protein
and lt-betar. results indicated presence synergizing agent
gamma interferon, hcv core protein enhances cytotoxic effects of
recombinant forms lt-betar ligand hela cells hepatoma cells.
furthermore, enhancement cytolytic activity cytokine specific,
since presence cycloheximide, expression hcv core protein
did elicit increase cytolytic activity tnf hela and
hepatoma cells. summary, hcv core protein associate lt-betar, and
this protein-protein interaction modulatory effect signaling pathway
of lt-betar certain cell types. given known roles of
lt-betar/lt-alpha1,beta2 receptor-ligand interactions normal development
of peripheral lymphoid organs triggering cytolytic activity nf-kappab 
activation certain cell types, finding implies hcv core protein
may aggravate biological functions lt-betar, resulting pathogenesis
in hcv-infected cells.
