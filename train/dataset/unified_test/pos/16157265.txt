the pathological mechanism sars-cov infection investigated. gene for
the sars-cov non-structural protein 10, located open reading
frame pp1a/pp1ab gene, synthesized used screen specific
cellular gene coding protein interacting nsp10 protein a
human embryo lung cdna library using yeast trap method. results indicated
that apart two subunits cellular rna polymerase complex, btf3 and
atf5, nsp10 protein also able interact specifically nadh 4l 
subunit cytochrome oxidase ii. study revealed activity of
the nadh-cytochrome altered inner mitochondrial membrane was
depolarized transfected human embryo lung fibroblast nsp10 protein 
gene. cytopathic effect coronavirus 229e strain appeared more
extensive cells control cells.
