suppression hepatitis b virus (hbv) replication, causative agent chronic
hepatitis, effective approach controlling disease progression. host
factors significant effect viral replication efficiency need 
better characterized. reported association clinical virus load
and deletions hbv viral promoter. showed hbv genome such
deletions led decreased replication compared wild type virus.
consistently, promoter deletion showed lower activity. cellular
transcription regulator recognizing promoter deletion revealed in
gel shift assay subsequently identified smarce 1 dna-protein array
assay. ability smarce 1 modulating replication efficiency hbv
was demonstrated. taken together, studies show direct dependence of
hbv host factor modulate replication efficiency, provided new
platform molecular characterization mechanisms disease outcome a
result binding new transcription factors rearranged promoter sequences.
