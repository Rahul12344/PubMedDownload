the protein kinase pkr (dsrna-dependent protein kinase) phosphorylates the
eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif2alpha downregulate protein
synthesis virus-infected cells. two double-stranded rna binding domains
(dsrbds) n-terminal half pkr thought bind activator
double-stranded rna, mediate dimerization protein target pkr the
ribosome. investigate importance dimerization pkr activity,
fusion proteins generated linking pkr kinase domain heterologous
dimerization domains. whereas isolated pkr kinase domain (kd) was
non-functional vivo, expression glutathione s-transferase-kd fusion, or
co-expression kd fusions containing heterodimerization domains the
xlim-1 ldb1 proteins, restored pkr activity yeast cells. finally,
coumermycin-mediated dimerization gyrb-kd fusion protein increased eif2alpha
phosphorylation inhibited reporter gene translation mammalian cells. these
results demonstrate critical importance dimerization pkr activity in
vivo, suggest primary function double-stranded rna binding the
dsrbds native pkr promote dimerization activation kinase
domain.
