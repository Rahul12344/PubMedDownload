chronic infection hcv closely correlated liver diseases as
cirrhosis, steatosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. understand long-term
interaction hcv host leads pathogenesis, identified
cellular proteins interact ns5a ns5b using biochemical approach. 
stable cell lines express flag-ns5a flag-ns5b tetracycline
induction generated. induced flag-tagged proteins were
immunoprecipitated (ip'd) associated proteins separated 2d gels. protein
spots specifically co-ip'd ns5a ns5b identified mass
spectrometry. hsp27 identified protein specifically co-ip'd with
ns5a ns5b. n-terminal regions ns5a (a.a. 1-181) hsp27
(a.a. 1-122) defined domains interact other. hsp27 
is generally distributed cytoplasm. heat shocked, hsp27 is
concentrated er ns5a co-localized.
