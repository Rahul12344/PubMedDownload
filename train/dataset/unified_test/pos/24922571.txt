neurotropic viruses, including mammalian reovirus, must disseminate an
initial site replication central nervous system (cns), often binding
multiple receptors facilitate systemic spread. reovirus engages junctional
adhesion molecule (jam-a) disseminate hematogenously. however, jam-a is
dispensable reovirus replication cns. demonstrate reovirus
binds nogo receptor ngr1, leucine-rich repeat protein expressed cns, 
infect neurons. expression ngr1 confers reovirus binding infection of
nonsusceptible cells. incubating reovirus virions soluble ngr1 neutralizes
infectivity. blocking ngr1 transfected cells primary cortical neurons
abrogates reovirus infection. concordantly, reovirus infection ablated in
primary cortical neurons derived ngr1 null mice. reovirus virions bind to
soluble jam-a ngr1, infectious disassembly intermediates (isvps) bind
only jam-a. results suggest reovirus uses different capsid
components bind distinct cell-surface molecules, engaging independent
receptors facilitate spread tropism.
