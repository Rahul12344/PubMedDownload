the rna polymerase influenza virus host range determinant virulence
factor. particular, pb2 subunit rna polymerase implicated 
as crucial factor affects cell tropism well virulence animal
models. findings suggest host factors associating pb2 protein
may play important role viral replication. order identify host
factors associate pb2 protein, purified recombinant pb2 from
transiently transfected mammalian cells identified copurifying host proteins 
by mass spectrometry. found pb2 protein associates cytosolic
chaperonin containing tcp-1 (cct), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (stip1), fk506
binding protein 5 (fkbp5), alpha- beta-tubulin, hsp60, mitochondrial
protein p32. binding partners associate other, suggesting
that pb2 might interact proteins multimeric complexes. more
detailed analysis interaction pb2 protein cct revealed that
pb2 associates cct monomer cct binding site located 
a central region pb2 protein. pb2 proteins various influenza virus
subtypes origins associate cct. silencing cct resulted reduced
viral replication reduced pb2 protein viral rna accumulation a
ribonucleoprotein reconstitution assay, suggesting important function cct 
during influenza virus life cycle. propose cct might acting a
chaperone pb2 aid folding possibly incorporation the
trimeric rna polymerase complex.
