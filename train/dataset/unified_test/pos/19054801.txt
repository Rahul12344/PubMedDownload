the carbohydrate binding characteristics norovirus gii.3 (chron1) a
gii.4 (dijon) strain investigated using virus-like particles (vlps) and
saliva samples 81 individuals genotyped fut2 (secretor) fut3 (lewis)
and phenotyped abo lewis blood groups. two vlps showed typical
secretor-gene-dependent binding bound significantly stronger saliva from
a, b, ab individuals (p < 0.0001 p < 0.001) bind 
to samples secretor-negative individuals. gii.3 strain showed larger
interindividual variation bound stronger saliva b a(2)
secretors (p < 0.01). assaying binding neoglycoproteins, gii.3
and gii.4 strains compared norwalk gi.1 prototype strain. although 
all three strains bound lewis b (and h type 1 chain) glycoconjugates, the
two gii strains showed additional binding sialyl lewis x. novel
binding specific since vlps bind structural analogs, e.g.,
lewis x sialyl lewis a, sialyl lewis x, sialyl dilewis x and
sialylated type 2 chain conjugates. inhibition experiments, sialyl lewis x
conjugate potent inhibitor. minimal requirement this
potential receptor structure neu5ac alpha 3gal beta 4(fuc alpha 3)glcnac beta 
3gal beta- fuc absolutely necessary binding. study shows
that human norovirus gii strains least two binding specificities:
one secretor-gene-dependent related alpha1,2-fucosylated carbohydrates and
another related alpha2,3-sialylated carbohydrates type 2 chain, e.g.,
sialyl lewis x.
