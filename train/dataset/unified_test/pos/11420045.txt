cytotoxic lymphocytes kill virus-infected target cells play critical role
in host recovery viral infections. granzyme b (grb) cytotoxic
lymphocyte granule protease plays critical role mediating cytotoxicity.
in studies, demonstrate adenovirus assembly protein l4--100k
(100k) grb substrate prevents cytotoxic lymphocyte granule-induced
apoptosis infected target cells potently inhibiting grb. inhibition is
absolutely dependent asp-48 100k, found within classic grb consensus
motif. 100k first viral protein described exclusively targets grb
pathway. represents novel class viral protease inhibitor, an
essential, multifunctional viral protein, vulnerable specific
proteolysis grb, expresses inhibitory function protease.
