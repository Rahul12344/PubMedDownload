human papillomaviruses (hpv) causative agents cervical cancers. the
infectious hpv life cycle closely linked differentiation state the
host epithelia, viral genome amplification, late gene expression virion 
production restricted suprabasal cells. e6 e7 proteins provide an
environment conducive dna synthesis upon differentiation, little known 
concerning mechanisms regulate productive viral genome amplification.
using keratinocytes stably maintain hpv-31 episomes, chemical
inhibitors, demonstrate viral proteins activate atm dna damage
response differentiating cells, indicated phosphorylation chk2, brca1
and nbs1. activation necessary viral genome amplification, well as
for formation viral replication foci. contrast, inhibition atm kinase
activity undifferentiated keratinocytes effect stable
maintenance viral genomes. previous studies shown hpvs induce low
levels caspase 3/7 activation upon differentiation important 
for cleavage e1 replication protein genome amplification. studies 
demonstrate caspase cleavage induced upon differentiation hpv positive
cells action dna damage protein kinase chk2, may be
activated result e7 binding atm kinase. findings identify 
major regulatory mechanism responsible productive hpv replication in
differentiating cells. results potential implications the
development anti-viral therapies treat hpv infections.
