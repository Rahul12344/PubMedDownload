greater 95% cervical carcinomas found associated with
"high-risk" human papillomavirus (mainly types 16 18) infections, the
viral e6 e7 oncoproteins essential neoplastic development and
maintenance. interferon-alpha (ifnalpha) used treatment hpv
infections yet vivo vitro data suggest virus has
developed mechanisms avoid effects interferon. show the
hpv16 e7 oncoprotein able inhibit induction ifnalpha-inducible genes
but effect ifngamma-inducible genes. expression e7 correlates with
the loss formation interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (isgf3)
transcription complex. moreover, presence e7, p48, dna-binding
component isgf3, unable translocate nucleus upon ifnalpha
stimulation. direct protein-protein interaction identified e7 and
p48 site interaction within e7 defined region amino
acids 17-37, domain includes binding site retinoblastoma
protein, prb. results suggest hpv, via e7, targets p48, resulting in
the loss ifnalpha-mediated signal transduction may provide means by
which hpv avoid innate immune system.
