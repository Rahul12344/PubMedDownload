vaccinia virus (vacv) used surrogate variola virus (varv) (genus
orthopoxvirus), causative agent smallpox, study orthopoxvirus
infection. varv principally transmitted humans aerosol droplets.
once inhaled, varv first infects respiratory tract could encounter
surfactant components, soluble pattern recognition receptors. surfactant 
protein (sp-d), constitutively present lining fluids respiratory 
tract, plays important roles innate host defense virus infection. we
investigated role sp-d vacv infection studied a27 viral protein
involvement interaction sp-d. interaction sp-d vacv
caused viral inhibition lung cell model. interaction sp-d vacv was
mediated a27 viral protein. binding required ca2+ interactions were
blocked presence excess sp-d saccharide ligands. a27, lacks
glycosylation, directly interacted sp-d. interaction sp-d and
the viral particle also observed using electron microscopy. infection mice
lacking sp-d (sp-d-/-) resulted increased mortality compared sp-d+/+ mice. 
altogether, data show sp-d participates host defense the
vaccinia virus infection interaction occurs viral surface
protein a27.
