human cytomegalovirus transient lytic dna replication relies cis-acting
element orilyt, six viral-encoded core proteins, proposed dna replication
initiator protein ul84, ie2, irs1 gene products ul112/113 loci. 
in effort elucidate cellular viral-encoded factors may play role
in orilyt-dependent replication used dna-affinity purification mass
spectrometry isolate identify several previously unknown cellular and
viral factors interact hcmv orilyt dna. proteins include the
multifunctional hnrnp-k, bub3, hmgb1, ptb-1, ul83, ul112/113, irs1. chromatin
immunoprecipitation (chip) assays confirmed interaction several these
factors orilyt. co-immunoprecipitation experiments detected interaction
between ul84 hnrnp-k infected transfected cells. knockdown hnrnp k 
expression sirna inhibited amplification orilyt transient assay.
together, data suggest possible regulatory role dna replication for
several previously unidentified viral cellular factors.
