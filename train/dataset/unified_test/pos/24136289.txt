hepatitis c virus (hcv) alters global behavior host cell create 
environment conducive replication, much remains unknown 
hcv proteins elicit changes. thus, better understanding interface 
between virus host cell required. report results a
large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen identify protein-protein interactions
between hcv genotype 2a (strain jfh1) cellular factors. study identified 
112 unique interactions 7 hcv 94 human proteins, 40% which
have linked hcv infection studies. interactions develop 
more complete picture hcv infection, providing insight hcv manipulation
of pathways, lipid cholesterol metabolism, previously
linked hcv infection implicating novel targets within
microtubule-organizing centers, complement system cell cycle regulatory
machinery. effort understand relationship hcv related
viruses, compared hcv 2a interactome hcv genotypes and
to related dengue virus. greater overlap observed hcv dengue 
virus targets hcv genotypes, demonstrating value parallel
screening approaches comparing virus-host cell interactomes. using sirnas to
inhibit expression cellular proteins, found five ten shared
targets tested (cul7, pcm1, rilpl2, rnaset2, tcf7l2) required for
replication hcv dengue virus. shared interactions provide
insight common features viral life cycles family flaviviridae.
