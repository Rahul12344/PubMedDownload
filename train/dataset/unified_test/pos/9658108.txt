the hepatitis virus cellular receptor 1 (havcr-1) cdna isolated cdna
expression library african green monkey kidney (agmk) cells using
protective monoclonal antibody (mab) 190/4, blocks binding hepatitis
a virus (hav) agmk cells. havcr-1 cdna codes havcr-1, 451-amino-acid
class integral-membrane mucin-like glycoprotein unknown natural function. to
determine existence human homolog(s) havcr-1 (huhavcr-1), used
havcr-1-specific primers amplify cdnas human liver kidney mrna by
reverse transcription-pcr. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the
amplified liver kidney huhavcr-1 cdnas identical coded for
a 359-amino-acid glycoprotein, termed huhavcr-1, approximately 79%
identical havcr-1. six cys residues extracellular domain havcr-1
and first n-glycosylation site conserved huhavcr-1. however, the
number hexameric repeats mucin-like region reduced 27 in
havcr-1 13 huhavcr-1. addition, 12 c-terminal amino acids the
cytoplasmic domain huhavcr-1 deleted. northern blot analysis poly(a)
rna showed huhavcr-1 expressed every organ analyzed, including the
liver, small intestine, colon, spleen, expressed higher
levels kidney testis. although dog cells transfected the
huhavcr-1 cdna express protective 190/4 epitope, bound hepatitis
a virus (hav) gained limited susceptibility hav infection. treatment 
mab 190/4 protect agmk cell transfectants expressing huhavcr-1 against
hav, suggesting hav infected cells via huhavcr-1 receptor 
the endogenously expressed havcr-1, blocked mab 190/4. data
demonstrate huhavcr-1 binding receptor hav suggest is
also functional receptor hav.
