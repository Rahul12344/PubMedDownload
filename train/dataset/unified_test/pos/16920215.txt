alternate serotypes adenovirus (ad), including ads species b, being
explored circumvent disadvantages ad serotype 5 gene delivery vectors. 
whereas majority human ads utilize coxsackievirus adenovirus
receptor (car), none ad species b use car. ad species b divided
into two subspecies, b1 b2, utilizes least two classes receptors:
common ad species b receptors b2 specific receptors. cd46 implicated
as b2-specific receptor. ad serotype 3 (ad3), member b1, utilizes cd80 and
cd86 cellular attachment receptors. receptor-interacting ad fiber-knob
domain highly homologous among species b ads. hypothesized other
members ad species b may utilize cd80 cd86 cellular attachment
receptors. tested species b members showed specific binding cells
expressing cd80 cd86, ad fiber-knob domain b1 b2 ad
efficiently blocked cd80- cd86-mediated infection ad3 vectors. members 
both b1 b2 demonstrated cd80- cd86-specific infection cho cells
expressing cd80 cd86. therefore, members ad species b utilize
cd80 cd86 infection cells.
