a computer search revealed 10 proteins homology sequence we
originally identified vimentin site cleavage human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) protease. 10 proteins (actin,
alpha-actinin, spectrin, tropomyosins, vinculin, dystrophin, map-2, villin, trk-1
and ig mu-chain), show 4 first 5 cleaved vitro this
protease, map-1 -2 [(1990) j. gen. virol. 71, 1985-1991]. these
proteins, cleavage restricted single motif, occurs many sites.
however, cleavage random, since 9 proteins including the
cytoskeletal proteins filamin band 4.1 cleaved vitro assay.
thus, ability hiv-1 protease cleave specific components the
cytoskeleton may important, although yet unevaluated aspect life 
cycle retrovirus and/or may directly contribute pathogenesis
observed infection.
