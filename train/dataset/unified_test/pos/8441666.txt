the cdna encoding adenovirus e1a enhancer-binding protein e1a-f isolated by
screening hela cell lambda gt11 expression library e1a-f site-specific dna 
binding. one cdna clone produced recombinant e1a-f protein dna
binding specificity endogenous hela cells. sequence analysis the
cdna showed homology ets-domain, region required sequence-specific
dna binding common ets oncogene members. analysis longest cdna 
revealed 94% identity amino acids human e1a-f mouse pea3
(polyomavirus enhancer activator 3), recently characterized ets oncogene
member. e1a-f encoded 2.5kb mrna hela cells, found to
increase early period adenovirus infection. contrast, ets-2 mrna
was significantly reduced infected hela cells. results indicate e1a
enhancer binding protein e1a-f member ets oncogene family is
probably human homologue mouse pea3.
