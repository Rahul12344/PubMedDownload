background information: several host proteins play crucial roles hiv-1
replication cycle. endosomal sorting complex required transport (escrt)
exemplifies large, multi-component host machinery required hiv-1 for
viral budding. escrt promotes inward budding vesicles membranes
of late endosomes generate multi-vesicular bodies. however, hiv-1 co-opts 
escrt enable outwards budding virus particles plasma membrane, a
phenomenon topologically similar multi-vesicular body biogenesis. a
role escrtii mrna trafficking established drosophila 
the escrt-ii components, vps22 vps36, promote localisation bicoid 
mrna fertilised egg. achieved via specific interactions the
staufen protein. work, investigated possible implication escrt-ii
in hiv-1 replication cycle.
results: co-immunoprecipitation analyses live cell tri-molecular fluorescence
complementation assays revealed interactions eap30 gag and
another eap30 staufen1 occur mammalian cells. depleted
eap30 (the orthologue vps22) sirna target escrt-ii hiv-1 expressing 
cells. treatment disrupted escrt-ii function leads degradation of
the two escrt-ii complex proteins, eap45 eap20, well the
associated rab7-interacting lysosomal protein. depletion eap30 led to
dramatically reduced viral structural protein gag virus production levels,
without effect viral rna levels. contrary, overexpression of
eap30 led several-fold increase virus production. unexpec-tedly,
sirna-mediated depletion eap30 led block hiv-1 genomic rna trafficking
and resulted accumulation genomic rna nucleus juxtanuclear
domains.
conclusions: data provide first evidence staufen1-escrt-ii
interaction evolutionarily conserved lower higher eukaryotes and
reveal novel role eap30 control hiv-1 rna trafficking gene
expression.
