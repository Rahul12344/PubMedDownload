oncogenesis associated human t-cell leukemia virus (htlv) infection is
directly linked virally encoded transcription factor tax. activate
htlv-1 transcription tax interacts cellular protein creb the
pleiotropic coactivators cbp p300. extensively studied, molecular
mechanisms tax transcription function coactivator utilization not
fully understood. previous studies focused tax binding kix domain 
of cbp, believed key step recruiting coactivator 
the htlv-1 promoter. study, identify carboxy-terminal region cbp 
(and p300) strongly interacts tax mediates tax transcription
function. deletion mutagenesis, identify amino acids 2003 2212 of
cbp, call carboxy-terminal region 2 (cr2), minimal region tax
interaction. interestingly, domain corresponds steroid receptor
coactivator 1 (src-1)-interacting domain cbp. show double point
mutant targeted one putative alpha-helical motifs domain
significantly compromises interaction tax. also characterize the
region tax responsible interaction cr2 show previously
identified transactivation domain tax (amino acids 312 319) participates in
cr2 binding. region tax corresponds consensus amphipathic helix, and
single point mutations targeted amino acids face helix abolish 
interaction cr2 dramatically reduce tax transcription function. finally,
we demonstrate tax src-1 bind cr2 mutually exclusive fashion.
together, studies identify novel tax-interacting site cbp/p300 and
extend understanding molecular mechanism tax transactivation.
