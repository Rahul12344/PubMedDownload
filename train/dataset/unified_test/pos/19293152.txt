sphingosine 1-phosphate (s1p) bioactive sphingolipid implicated diverse
cellular functions including survival, proliferation, tumorigenesis,
inflammation, immunity. sphingosine kinase (sphk) contributes these
functions converting sphingosine s1p. report nonstructural
protein ns3 bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), close relative of
hepatitis c virus (hcv), binds inhibits catalytic activity sphk1
independently serine protease activity, whereas hcv ns3 affect
sphk1 activity. uncleaved ns2-3 bvdv also found interact and
inhibit sphk1. suspect inhibition sphk1 activity bvdv ns3 ns2-3
may benefit viral replication, sphk1 inhibition small interfering rna,
chemical inhibitor, overexpression catalytically inactive sphk1 results 
enhanced viral replication, although mechanisms sphk1 inhibition
leads enhanced viral replication remain unknown. role sphk1 inhibition in
viral cytopathogenesis also suggested overexpression sphk1 significantly
attenuates induction apoptosis cells infected cytopathogenic bvdv.
these findings suggest sphk targeted virus regulate its
catalytic activity.
