replication japanese encephalitis virus (jev) genome depends host
factors successfully completing life cycles; this, host factors
have recruited and/or relocated site viral replication.
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), cellular metabolic protein,
was found colocalize viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (ns5) in
jev-infected cells. subcellular fractionation indicated gapdh
remained relatively constant cytosol, increasing 12 24 hours
postinfection (hpi) decreasing 36 hpi nuclear fraction infected 
cells. contrast, redistribution patterns gapdh observed the
uninfected cells. co-immunoprecipitation gapdh jev ns5 protein revealed no
direct protein-protein interaction; instead, gapdh binds 3' termini of
plus- minus-strand rnas jev electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
accordingly, gapdh binds minus strand efficiently plus
strand jev rnas. study highlights findings infection jev
changes subcellular localization gapdh suggesting metabolic enzyme
may play role jev replication.
