a random-primed cdna expression library constructed mrna of
neuroblastoma cells (ng108) used clone specific rabies virus (rv)
receptor. soluble form rv glycoprotein (gs) utilized ligand 
detect positive cells. identified murine low-affinity nerve-growth factor 
receptor, p75ntr. bsr cells stably expressing p75ntr able bind gs and
g-expressing lepidopteran cells. ability rv glycoprotein bind
p75ntr dependent presence lysine arginine positions 330
and 333 respectively antigenic site iii, known control virus
penetration motor sensory neurons adult mice. p75ntr-expressing bsr
cells permissive non-adapted fox rv isolate (street virus) nerve
growth factor (ngf) decreased infection. infected cells, p75ntr
associates rv glycoprotein could precipitated anti-g
monoclonal antibodies. therefore, p75ntr receptor street rv.
