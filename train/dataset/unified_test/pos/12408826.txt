here investigated capping methylation hiv pre-mrnas coupled 
pol ii elongation. stable binding capping enzyme (mce1) cap
methyltransferase (hcm1) template-engaged pol ii depends ctd
phosphorylation, nascent rna. mce1 hcm1 travel pol ii
during elongation. capping methylation reactions cannot occur the
nascent pre-mrna attained chain length 19-22 nucleotides. hiv pre-mrnas 
are capped quantitatively elongation complexes halted at
promoter-proximal positions, capping much less efficient unimpeded 
pol ii elongation. cotranscriptional capping hiv mrna strongly stimulated
by tat, stimulation requires c-terminal segment tat mediates
its direct binding mce1. findings implicate capping elongation
checkpoint critical hiv gene expression.
