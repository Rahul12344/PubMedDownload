The positive-strand RNA genomes of caliciviruses are not capped, but are instead 
covalently linked at their 5' ends to a viral protein called VPg. The lack of a
cap structure typical of eukaryotic mRNA and absence of an internal ribosomal
entry site suggest that VPg may function in translation initiation on calicivirus
RNA. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing binding of Norwalk virus VPg to
translation initiation factors. The eIF3d subunit of eIF3 was identified as a
binding partner of VPg by yeast two-hybrid analysis. VPg bound to purified
mammalian eIF3 and to eIF3 in mammalian cell lysates. To test the effects of the 
VPg- eIF3 interaction on translation, VPg was added to cell-free translation
reactions programmed with either capped reporter RNA, an RNA containing an EMCV
internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) or an RNA with a cricket paralysis virus
IRES. VPg inhibited translation of all reporter RNAs in a dose-dependent manner. 
Together, the data suggest that VPg may play a role in initiating translation on 
calicivirus RNA through unique protein-protein interactions with the translation 
machinery.
