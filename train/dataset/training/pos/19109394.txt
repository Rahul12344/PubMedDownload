The papillomavirus E2 proteins regulate viral replication, gene transcription,
and genome maintenance by interacting with other viral and host proteins. From a 
yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the cellular protein Tax1BP1 as a novel
binding partner of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) E2. Tax1BP1 also
interacts with the HPV16 and bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) E2 proteins,
with the C-terminal region of Tax1BP1 interacting with the N-terminal
transactivation domain of BPV1 E2. Tax1BP1 complexes with p300 and acts
synergistically as a coactivator with p300 to enhance E2-dependent transcription.
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that Tax1BP1 and E2 localize 
to the long control region on the BPV1 genome. Tax1BP1 was recently reported to
bind ubiquitin and to function as an essential component of an A20
ubiquitin-editing complex. We demonstrate that Tax1BP1 plays a role in the
regulation of the steady-state level of E2 by preventing its proteasomal
degradation. These studies provide new insights into the regulation of E2
functions.
