Infection with some viruses can alter cellular mRNA processing to favor viral
gene expression. We present evidence that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) protein 
ICP27, which contributes to host shut-off by inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing,
interacts with essential splicing factors termed SR proteins and affects their
phosphorylation. During HSV-1 infection, phosphorylation of several SR proteins
was reduced and this correlated with a subnuclear redistribution. Exogenous SR
proteins restored splicing in ICP27-inhibited nuclear extracts and SR proteins
isolated from HSV-1-infected cells activated splicing in uninfected S100
extracts, indicating that inhibition occurs by a reversible mechanism.
Spliceosome assembly was blocked at the pre-spliceosomal complex A stage.
Furthermore, we show that ICP27 interacts with SRPK1 and relocalizes it to the
nucleus; moreover, SRPK1 activity was altered in the presence of ICP27 in vitro. 
We propose that ICP27 modifies SRPK1 activity resulting in hypophosphorylation of
SR proteins impairing their ability to function in spliceosome assembly.
