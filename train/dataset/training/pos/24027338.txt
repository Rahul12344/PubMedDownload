Alphaherpesvirinae family members can reactivate from latency following stress.
The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone induces certain cellular transcription
factors in murine and bovine trigeminal ganglionic neurons. Three
dexamethasone-induced transcription factors, Kr√ºppel-like factor 15, Slug, and
SPDEF, stimulated the herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) 
promoter more than 150-fold. Conversely, other viral promoters (VP16 and ICP4)
were not strongly stimulated, suggesting that the ICP0 promoter is preferentially
activated by dexamethasone-simulated stress.
