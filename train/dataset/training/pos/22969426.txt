The cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery
participates in membrane scission and cytoplasmic budding of many RNA viruses.
Here, we found that expression of dominant negative ESCRT proteins caused a
blockade of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) release and retention of viral BFRF1 at the 
nuclear envelope. The ESCRT adaptor protein Alix was redistributed and partially 
colocalized with BFRF1 at the nuclear rim of virus replicating cells. Following
transient transfection, BFRF1 associated with ESCRT proteins, reorganized the
nuclear membrane and induced perinuclear vesicle formation. Multiple domains
within BFRF1 mediated vesicle formation and Alix recruitment, whereas both Bro
and PRR domains of Alix interacted with BFRF1. Inhibition of ESCRT machinery
abolished BFRF1-induced vesicle formation, leading to the accumulation of viral
DNA and capsid proteins in the nucleus of EBV-replicating cells. Overall, data
here suggest that BFRF1 recruits the ESCRT components to modulate nuclear
envelope for the nuclear egress of EBV.
