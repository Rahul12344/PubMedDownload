In herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), binding clusters enriched in CTCF during
latency have been previously identified. We hypothesized that CTCF binding to
CTCF clusters in HSV-1 would be disrupted in a reactivation event. To
investigate, CTCF occupation of three CTCF binding clusters in HSV-1 was analyzed
following sodium butyrate (NaB)- and explant-induced reactivation in the mouse.
Our data show that the CTCF domains positioned within the HSV-1 genome,
specifically around the latency-associated transcript (LAT) and ICP0 and ICP4
regions of the genome, lose CTCF occupancy following the application of
reactivation stimuli in wild-type virus. We also found that CTCF binding clusters
upstream of the ICP0 and ICP4 promoters both function as classical insulators
capable of acting as enhancer blockers of the LAT enhancer. Finally, our results 
suggest that CTCF occupation of domains in HSV-1 may be differentially regulated 
both during latency and at early times following reactivation by the presence of 
lytic transcripts and further implicate epigenetic regulation of HSV-1 as a
critical component of the latency-reactivation transition.
