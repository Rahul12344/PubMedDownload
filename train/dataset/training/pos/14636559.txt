The pol (for polymerase) gene of the murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) is expressed
in the form of a large Gag-Pol precursor protein by the suppression of
translational termination, or enhanced readthrough, of a UAG stop codon at the
end of gag. A search for cellular proteins that interact with the reverse
transcriptase of Moloney MuLV resulted in the identification of eRF1, the
eukaryotic translation release factor 1. The proteins bound strongly in vitro,
and the overexpression of eRF1 resulted in the RT-dependent incorporation of the 
protein into assembling virion particles. The overexpression of RT in trans
enhanced the translational readthrough of a reporter construct containing the
Gag-Pol boundary region. Noninteracting mutants of RT failed to synthesize
adequate levels of Gag-Pol and could not replicate. These results suggest that RT
enhances suppression of termination and that the interaction of RT with eRF1 is
required for an appropriate level of translational readthrough.
