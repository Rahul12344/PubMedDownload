BACKGROUND: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of
adult T-cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV-1 encodes
transactivator protein Tax that interacts with various cellular factors to
modulate transcription and other biological functions. Additional cellular
mediators of Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of HTLV-1 long terminal
repeats (LTR) remain to be identified and characterized.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of group I
p21-activated kinases (Paks) in Tax-induced LTR activation. Both wild-type and
kinase-dead mutants of Pak3 were capable of potentiating the activity of Tax to
activate LTR transcription. The effect of Paks on the LTR was attributed to the
N-terminal regulatory domain and required the action of CREB, CREB-regulating
transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) and p300/CREB-binding protein. Paks
physically associated with Tax and CRTCs. Paks were recruited to the LTR in the
presence of Tax. siRNAs against either Pak1 or Pak3 prevented the interaction of 
Tax with CRTC1 and the recruitment of Tax to the LTR. These siRNAs also inhibited
LTR-dependent transcription in HTLV-1-transformed MT4 cells and in cells
transfected with an infectious clone of HTLV-1.
CONCLUSION: Group I Paks augment Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of
HTLV-1 LTR in a kinase-independent manner.
