Human MxA, an interferon-inducible cytoplasmic dynamin-like GTPase, possesses
antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses. Recently, MxA has also been
demonstrated to have activity against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a well-known
DNA virus responsible for acute and chronic liver disease in humans. We
investigated the molecular mechanism for the anti-HBV activity of MxA. Our
results demonstrated that in HepG2.2.15 cells, MxA GTPase independently
suppressed the production of hepatitis B surface antigen and HBV DNA without
changing the level of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and the distribution of
HBV mRNA. MxA significantly reduced the level of the encapsidated pregenomic RNA.
Through its central interactive domain, MxA interacted with HBcAg, causing
accumulation of the proteins in perinuclear compartments. MxA-HBcAg interaction
significantly affected the dynamics of HBcAg by immobilizing HBcAg in the
perinuclear structures.CONCLUSION: MxA displays antiviral activity against HBV
involving a mechanism of MxA-HBcAg interaction that may interfere with core
particle formation.
