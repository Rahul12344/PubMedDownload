Cell proteins can restrict the replication of viruses. Here, we identify the
cellular BclAF1 protein as a human cytomegalovirus restriction factor and
describe two independent mechanisms the virus uses to decrease its steady-state
levels. Immediately following infection, the viral pp71 and UL35 proteins, which 
are delivered to cells within virions, direct the proteasomal degradation of
BclAF1. Although BclAF1 reaccumulates through the middle stages of infection, it 
is subsequently down-regulated at late times by miR-UL112-1, a virus-encoded
microRNA. In the absence of BclAF1 neutralization, viral gene expression and
replication are inhibited. These data identify two temporally and mechanistically
distinct functions used by human cytomegalovirus to down-regulate a cellular
antiviral protein.
