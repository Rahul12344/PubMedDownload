We have identified cellular proteins that interact with the herpes simplex virus 
type 1 (HSV-1) origin-binding protein (UL9 protein) by screening a HeLa cell
complementary DNA library by using the yeast two-hybrid system. Approximately 7 x
10(5) colonies were screened. Five of the 48 positive clones contained cDNAs that
encoded the p150(Glued) component of the dynactin complex, three contained cDNAs 
for the neural F Box 42-kDa protein (NFB42), which is highly enriched in neural
tissue, and three contained hTid-1, a human homologue of the bacterial DnaJ
protein. We have focused in this report on the interaction of the viral UL9
protein with the cellular hTid-1. In vitro immunoprecipitation experiments
confirmed that hTid-1 interacts with the UL9 protein. Electrophoretic
mobility-shift assays indicated that the hTid-1 enhances the binding of UL9
protein to an HSV-1 origin, ori(s), and facilitates formation of the multimer
from the dimeric UL9 protein. hTid-1 had no effect on the DNA-dependent ATPase or
helicase activities associated with the UL9 protein. These findings implicate
hTid-1 in HSV-1 DNA replication, and suggest that this cellular protein may
provide a chaperone function analogous to the DnaJ protein in Escherichia coli
DNA replication.
