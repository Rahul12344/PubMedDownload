The virulence of influenza A viruses depends on the activity of the viral RNA
polymerase complex and viral regulatory phosphoproteins. We identified that the
protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö6976 had a post-entry anti-influenza viral
effect, by using a polymerase activity-based reporter assay. This inhibitory
effect was observed for influenza virus-infected cells as well as for cells
transiently transfected with constructs for the RNA polymerase complex.
Importantly, the in vitro analysis of viral protein phosphorylation identified
PKCalpha as a kinase phosphorylating PB1 and NS1, but not PB2, PA or NP. Gö6976
was able to block PKC-specific phosphorylation in vitro. Thus, our data suggest
that PKC contributes to the phosphorylation of influenza PB1 and NS1 proteins
which appears to be functionally relevant for both viral RNA polymerase activity 
and efficient viral replication.
