The granule exocytosis pathway of cytotoxic lymphocytes plays critical roles in
eradication of intracellular viruses. However, how hepatitis B virus (HBV) is
cleared has not been defined. To clarify immune mechanisms underlying inhibition 
of the HBV replication, the relationship between granzyme H (GzmH) and HBV
clearance was investigated. In this study, we found that the granule exocytosis
pathway can inhibit HBV replication without induction of cytolysis of the
infected cells. GzmH is essential for HBV eradication. The HBx protein (HBx),
required for the replication of HBV, is cleaved at Met(79) by GzmH. GzmH
inhibitor can abolish GzmH- and lymphokine-activated killer cell-mediated HBx
degradation and HBV clearance. An HBx-deficient HBV is resistant to GzmH- and
lymphokine-activated killer cell-mediated viral clearance. Adoptive transfer of
GzmH-overexpressing NK cells into HBV carrier mice facilitates in vivo HBV
eradication. Importantly, low GzmH expression in cytotoxic lymphocytes of
individuals is susceptible to HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. These
results indicate that GzmH might be detected as a potential parameter for
diagnosis of HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.
