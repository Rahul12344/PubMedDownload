Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with the majority of cervical
cancers and encode a transforming protein, E6, that interacts with the tumor
suppressor protein p53. Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the
yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One
such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine
papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants
correlated with their E6BP-binding ability. E6BP is identical to a putative
calcium-binding protein, ERC-55, that appears to be localized in the endoplasmic 
reticulum.
