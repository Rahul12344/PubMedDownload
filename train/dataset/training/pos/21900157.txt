The influenza A virus polymerase associates with a number of cellular
transcription-related factors, including RNA polymerase II. We previously
described the interaction of influenza virus polymerase subunit PA with human
CLE/C14orf166 protein (hCLE), a positive modulator of this cellular RNA
polymerase. Here, we show that hCLE also interacts with the influenza virus
polymerase complex and colocalizes with viral ribonucleoproteins. Silencing of
hCLE causes reduction of viral polymerase activity, viral RNA transcription and
replication, virus titer, and viral particle production. Altogether, these
findings indicate that the cellular transcription factor hCLE is an important
protein for influenza virus replication.
