The involvement of Tax oncoprotein in the INK4-CDK4/6-Rb pathway has been
regarded as a key factor for immortalization and transformation of human T-cell
leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) infected cells. In both p16 -/- and +/+ cells,
expression of Tax has been correlated with an increase in CDK4 activity, which
subsequently increases the phosphorylation of Rb and drives the infected cells
into cell cycle progression. In relation to these effects, Tax has been shown to 
interact with two components of the INK4-CDK4/6-Rb pathway, p16 and cyclin D(s). 
While Tax competes with CDK4 for p16 binding, thus suppressing p16 inhibition of 
CDK4, Tax also binds to cyclin D(s) with concomitant increases in both CDK4
activity and the phosphorylation of cyclin D(s). Here we show that both Tax and
residues 1-40 of the N-terminus of Tax, Tax40N, bind to and activate CDK4 in
vitro. In the presence of INK4 proteins, binding of Tax and Tax40N to CDK4
counteracts against the inhibition of p16 and p18 and acts as the major path to
regulate Tax-mediated activation of CDK4. We also report that Tax40N retains the 
transactivation ability. These results of in vitro studies demonstrate a
potentially novel, p16-independent route to regulate CDK4 activity by the Tax
oncoprotein in HTLV-1 infected cells.
