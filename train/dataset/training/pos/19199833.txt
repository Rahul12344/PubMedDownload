Flavivirus NS5 associates with host-cell proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and
regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis-2 (RIMS2) via an internal PDZ binding
mechanism.

Dengue virus (DENV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are flaviviruses,
which can cause lethal hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, respectively. Here, we
demonstrate that the TBEV-NS5 and DENV-NS5 proteins use an internal binding
mechanism to target human PDZ proteins. TBEV-NS5 has high affinity to regulating 
synaptic membrane exocytosis-2 (RIMS2) and Scribble, whereas DENV-NS5 binds
primarily to the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Targeting of
TBEV-NS5 to the plasma membrane is stabilised by ZO-1; however, DENV-NS5
co-localises with ZO-1 in the nucleus. These interactions have potential
important roles in the ability of flaviviruses to manipulate cell proliferation, 
junction permeability and the interferon pathways.
