The human papillomavirus (HPV) L2 capsid protein plays an essential role during
the early stages of viral infection, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its 
mode of action remain obscure. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified the
adaptor protein, sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) as a strong interacting partner of HPV 
L2. This interaction occurs through a highly conserved SNX17 consensus binding
motif, which is present in the majority of HPV L2 proteins analysed. Using
mutants of L2 defective for SNX17 interaction, or siRNA ablation of SNX17
expression, we demonstrate that the interaction between L2 and SNX17 is essential
for viral infection. Furthermore, loss of the L2-SNX17 interaction results in
enhanced turnover of the L2 protein and decreased stability of the viral capsids,
and concomitantly, there is a dramatic decrease in the efficiency with which
viral genomes transit to the nucleus. Indeed, using a range of endosomal and
lysosomal markers, we show that capsids defective in their capacity to bind SNX17
transit much more rapidly to the lysosomal compartment. These results demonstrate
that the L2-SNX17 interaction is essential for viral infection and facilitates
the escape of the L2-DNA complex from the late endosomal/lysosomal compartments.
