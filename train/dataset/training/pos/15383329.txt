In a screen for binding partners of the Epstein-Barr virus transformation-related
protein EBNA2, we cloned a novel, evolutionarily conserved protein showing
similarity to the Drosophila Parallel Sister Chromatids Protein (PASC). We have
named this protein "Friend of EBNA2" (FOE). Human FOE encodes a protein of 1227
amino acids with a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal, an
arginine-rich motif, a putative nuclear export signal as well as with three
highly acidic regions and a predicted coiled-coil domain. FOE and EBNA2
coimmunoprecipitate from lymphocyte nuclear extracts. RNA and protein blots show 
that FOE is expressed in all human tissues. FOE is a nuclear protein with the
bulk of the protein associated with the insoluble nuclear fraction biochemically 
defined as the nuclear matrix. Indirect immunofluorescence and dynamic imaging
studies suggest that FOE associates with transcriptionally active nuclear
subregions in interphase cells and concentrates at the ends of formed chromosomes
during mitosis.
