The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax transactivator is known to
induce or repress various cellular genes, several of them encoding transcription 
factors. As Tax is known to deregulate various basic bHLH factors, we looked more
specifically at its effect on TAL1 (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1), also 
known as SCL (stem cell leukemia). Indeed, TAL1 is deregulated in a high
percentage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and its oncogenic
properties are well-established. Here we show that Tax induces transcription of
this proto-oncogene by stimulating the activity of the TAL1 gene promoter 1b,
through both the CREB and NF-kappaB pathways. It was also observed that TAL1
upregulates HTLV-1 promoter activity, in either the presence or the absence of
Tax. The viral promoter is inhibited in trans by expression of the E2A protein
E47, and TAL1 is able to abrogate this inhibition. These data show the existence 
of a positive feedback loop between Tax and TAL1 expression and support the
notion that this proto-oncogene participates in generation of adult T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma by increasing the amount of the Tax oncoprotein but also
possibly by its own transforming activities.
