Topors, a p53 and topoisomerase I binding protein, interacts with the

expression.

The adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) Rep proteins are essential for AAV DNA 
replication and regulation of AAV gene expression. We have identified a cellular 
protein interacting with Rep78 and Rep68 in yeast two-hybrid analysis and in GST 
pull-down assays. This protein has recently been described as both a p53 (p53BP3)
and a topoisomerase I interacting protein (Topors). It contains an
arginine/serine-rich domain, a RING finger domain and five PEST sequences. A
minimal sequence sufficient for interaction with Rep was mapped to Topors amino
acids 871 to 917. We show that the same region is also involved in the
interaction with p53. Rep sequences involved in interaction with Topors were
mapped to Rep amino acids 172 to 481. Overexpression of Topors stimulated AAV
gene expression in the absence of helper virus, suggesting a function of Topors
as a transcriptional regulator.
