In searching for cellular targets of the HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax, we identified
TXBP181, which we characterized as the human homolog of yeast mitotic checkpoint 
MAD1 protein. Evidence supporting TXBP181 as HsMAD1 includes sequence
conservation with yeast MAD1, hyperphosphorylation during S/G2/M phases and upon 
treatment of cells with nocodazole, and binding to HsMAD2. HsMAD1 functions as a 
homodimer. It localizes to the centrosome during metaphase and to the spindle
midzone and the midbody during anaphase and telophase. Expression of either Tax
or a transdominant-negative TXBP181 results in multinucleated cells, a phenotype 
consistent with a loss of HsMAD1 function. We propose a model of viral
transformation in which Tax targets TXBP181, thereby abrogating a mitotic
checkpoint.
