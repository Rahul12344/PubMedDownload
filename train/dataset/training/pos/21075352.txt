Dengue virus encodes several interferon antagonists. Among these the NS5 protein 
binds STAT2, a necessary component of the type I interferon signaling pathway,
and targets it for degradation. We now demonstrate that the ability of dengue NS5
to associate with and degrade STAT2 is species specific. Thus, NS5 is able to
bind and degrade human STAT2, but not mouse STAT2. This difference was exploited 
to demonstrate, absent manipulation of the viral genome, that NS5-mediated IFN
antagonism is essential for efficient virus replication. Moreover, we demonstrate
that differences in NS5 mediated binding and degradation between human and mouse 
STAT2 maps to a region within the STAT2 coiled-coil domain. By using STAT2(-/-)
mice, we also demonstrate that mouse STAT2 restricts early dengue virus
replication in vivo. These results suggest that overcoming this restriction
through transgenic mouse technology may help in the development of a long-sought 
immune-competent mouse model of dengue virus infection.
