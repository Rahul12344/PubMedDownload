Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) IE3 protein is a multifunctional viral protein that
interacts with several target proteins of both viral and host cellular origin. To
investigate the biological function of IE3 in the pathogenesis of the brain
disorders caused by CMV, a screening for host cellular proteins that could
interact with IE3 was performed. By yeast two-hybrid screening, ankyrin repeats
domain 17 (Ankrd17, also known as Gtar) was identified as a host factor that
could interact with IE3. This interaction was verified by yeast two-hybrid assay 
and chemiluminescent co-immunoprecipitaion. Mapping analysis suggested that the
1-148 residues of IE3 were responsible for the interaction. These results
suggested that the interaction between Ankrd17 and IE3 may play a key role in the
pathogenesis of MCMV-associated disease.
