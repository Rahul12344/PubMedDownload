BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef-encoded protein plays
key functions at almost all stages of the viral life cycle, but its role in
translation is largely unknown.
METHODS: To determine the effect of Nef on translation we used an in vitro
translation assay. The detection of Nef/RPS10 complexes and the presence of 18S
rRNA and tRNAs in the complexes were performed by coimmunoprecipitation and
RT-PCR assay.
RESULTS: We observed that the HIV-1 Nef protein specifically impaired translation
in vitro. We observed the interaction of Nef with RPS10 by coimmunoprecipitation 
assay. In addition 18S rRNA and tRNAs were present in the Nef/RPS10 complexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a model in which the Nef protein by 
binding to two components of the 40S small ribosomal subunit, RPS10 and 18S rRNA,
and to a lesser extent to tRNAs, could lead to decreased protein synthesis.
