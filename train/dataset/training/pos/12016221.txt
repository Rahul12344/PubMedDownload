We have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase is
an unstable protein and a substrate for the N-end rule degradation pathway. This 
degradation pathway shares its ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, with the
post-replication/translesion DNA repair pathway. Because DNA repair is thought to
play an essential role in HIV-1 integration, we investigated whether other
molecules of this DNA repair pathway could interact with integrase. We observed
that co-expression of human Rad18 induced the accumulation of an otherwise
unstable form of HIV-1 integrase. This accumulation occurred even though hRAD18
possesses a RING finger domain, a structure that is generally associated with E3 
ubiquitin ligase function and protein degradation. Evidence for an interaction
between integrase and hRad18 was obtained through reciprocal
co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover we found that a 162-residue region of hRad18
(amino acids 65-226) was sufficient for both integrase stabilization and
interaction. Finally, we observed that HIV-1 integrase co-localized with hRad18
in nuclear structures in a subpopulation of co-transfected cells. Taken together,
these findings identify hRad18 as a novel interacting partner of HIV-1 integrase 
and suggest a role for post-replication/translesion DNA repair in the retroviral 
integration process.
