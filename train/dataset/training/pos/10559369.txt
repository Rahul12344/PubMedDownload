Previously we demonstrated that murine retroviral Gag proteins associate with a
cellular motor protein, KIF-4. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we also found an
association of KIF-4 with Gag proteins of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV),
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1). Studies performed with mammalian cell systems confirmed that the HIV-1
Gag protein associates with KIF-4. Soluble cytoplasmic proteins from cells
infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the entire Gag-Pol precursor 
protein of HIV-1 or transfected with HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 were
fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and further separated by
size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatographies. KIF-4 and HIV-1 Gag
cofractionated in both chromatographic separations. Immunoprecipitation assays
have also verified the KIF-4-Gag association. KIF-4 binds mainly to the Gag
precursor (Pr55 Gag) and a matrix-capsid processing intermediate (Pr42) but not
to other processed Gag products. The binding of Gag is mediated by a domain of
KIF-4 proximal to the C terminus. These results, and our previous studies, raise 
the possibility that KIF-4 may play an important role in retrovirus Gag protein
transport.
