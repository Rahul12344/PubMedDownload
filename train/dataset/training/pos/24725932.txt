Previously, we showed that ADAM10 is necessary for HIV-1 replication in primary
human macrophages and immortalized cell lines. Silencing ADAM10 expression
interrupted the HIV-1 life cycle prior to nuclear translocation of viral cDNA.
Furthermore, our data indicated that HIV-1 replication depends on the expression 
of ADAM15 and γ-secretase, which proteolytically processes ADAM10. Silencing
ADAM15 or γ-secretase expression inhibits HIV-1 replication between reverse
transcription and nuclear entry. Here, we show that ADAM10 expression also
supports replication in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. The intracellular domain (ICD) of
ADAM10 associates with the HIV-1 pre-integration complex (PIC) in the cytoplasm
and immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with HIV-1 integrase, a key component of 
PIC. Taken together, our data support a model whereby ADAM15/γ-secretase
processing of ADAM10 releases the ICD, which then incorporates into HIV-1 PIC to 
facilitate nuclear trafficking. Thus, these studies suggest ADAM10 as a novel
therapeutic target for inhibiting HIV-1 prior to nuclear entry.
