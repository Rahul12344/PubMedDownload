The human NR4A1 orphan receptor is a member of the TR3 steroid receptor
superfamily, which binds DNA at the NBRE and NurRE responsive elements. The TR3
receptors are involved in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation and
apoptosis. We report that NR4A1 interacts with human papillomavirus type 16
(HPV16) E2 protein--a key papillomavirus regulatory factor. This interaction
might be involved in the transcription regulation of the HPV16 genes and the
regulation of infected cell homeostasis.
