Hepatitis C virus (HCV) interacts with human platelets in vivo as a potential
transport of infectious virions to the target liver. The binding of native viral 
particles with the platelet membrane glycoprotein VI (GPVI) was analysed. A
consistent interaction between HCV from plasma or after purification by two
different methods and the recombinant extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like
domains of human GPVI (hD1D2) was observed with two independent experimental
approaches: pull-down and ELISA assays. Between 2 and 7 % of HCV particles were
specifically bound to hD1D2. The binding was inhibited by an anti-hD1D2 in a
dose-dependent manner. Human D1D2 interaction with HCV was significantly higher
than the murine D1D2, supporting the specificity of the interaction and to the
single human domains (D1 and D2), suggesting that both Ig-like domains of the
molecule are required for efficient binding. GPVI may be a platelet surface
ligand for HCV playing a role in viral transport and persistence.
