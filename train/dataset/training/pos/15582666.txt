Sumoylation of the papillomavirus (PV) origin binding helicase E1 protein is
critical for its function. Consequently, factors modulating the sumoylation of E1
could ultimately alter the outcome of a papillomavirus infection. We investigated
the role played by phosphorylation and two known SUMO E3 ligases, RanBP2 and PIAS
proteins, on the sumoylation of E1. E1 sumoylation was unaffected by
phosphorylation as both wild-type and pseudo-phosphorylation mutants of BPV E1
exhibited similar sumoylation profiles. RanBP2 bound to BPV E1, but not to HPV11 
E1, and lacked sumoylation enhancing activity for either E1. In contrast,
proteins of the PIAS family (except PIASy) bound to both BPV and HPV11 E1 and
stimulated their sumoylation. The structural integrity of the RING finger domain 
of the PIAS proteins was required for their E3 SUMO ligase activity on PV E1
sumoylation but was dispensable for their PV E1 binding activity. Miz1, the PIAS 
protein exerting the strongest E1 sumoylation enhancing activity, favored SUMO1
versus SUMO2 as the modifier and was shown to be transcribed in a keratinocyte
cell line. This study indicates PIAS proteins as possible modulators of PV E1
sumoylation during papillomavirus infections.
