Human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV5) E4orf6 (early region 4 open reading frame 6
protein) is a multifunctional early viral protein promoting efficient replication
and progeny production. E4orf6 complexes with E1B-55K to assemble cellular
proteins into a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that not only mediates
proteasomal degradation of host cell substrates but also facilitates export of
viral late mRNA to promote efficient viral protein expression and host cell
shutoff. Recent findings defined the role of E4orf6 in RNA splicing independent
of E1B-55K binding. To reveal further functions of the early viral protein in
infected cells, we used a yeast two-hybrid system and identified the homeobox
transcription factor HoxB7 as a novel E4orf6-associated protein. Using a HoxB7
knockdown cell line, we observed a positive role of HoxB7 in adenoviral
replication. Our experiments demonstrate that the absence of HoxB7 leads to
inefficient viral progeny production, as HAdV5 gene expression is highly
regulated by HoxB7-mediated activation of various adenoviral promoters. We have
thus identified a novel role of E4orf6 in HAdV5 gene transcription via regulation
of homeobox protein-dependent modulation of viral promoter activity.
