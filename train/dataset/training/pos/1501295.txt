We have identified three consensus E-box motifs in the long terminal repeat of
human immunodeficiency virus type 1. One of these E boxes interacts selectively
with representative members of the class A group of basic helix-loop-helix
proteins, including HTF4, E47, and their heterodimers. Our analyses implicate the
helix-loop-helix proteins in regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
gene expression.
