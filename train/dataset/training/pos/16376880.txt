The HBx protein of hepatitis B virus is involved in deregulation of cell cycle
and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Since c-Myc also plays an important 
role in cell proliferation and tumor development, we studied its regulation by
HBx in a human hepatoma cell line. Co-expression of HBx and c-Myc resulted in
increased stability of intracellular c-Myc. HBx blocked the ubiquitination of Myc
through a direct interaction with the F box region of Skp2 and destabilization of
the SCF(Skp2) complex. We suggest that sustained presence of c-Myc combined with 
mitogenic activity inherent to HBx may be associated with cell cycle deregulation
and transformation.
