The 68k ankyrin-like protein (68k-ank) of unknown function is highly conserved
among orthopoxviruses and contains ankyrin repeats and an F-box-like domain. We
performed a yeast-two-hybrid screen with 68k-ank to find interacting proteins.
From a human and a murine cDNA library, 99% of the interaction partners were
S-phase kinase-associated protein 1a (Skp1a), a part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase 
complex. 68k-ank co-immunoprecipitated with components of the endogenous,
mammalian SCF ubiquitin ligase. This interaction was F-box domain dependent and
could also be observed in infected cells, indicating that SCF complex formation
might be important for the viral life cycle.
