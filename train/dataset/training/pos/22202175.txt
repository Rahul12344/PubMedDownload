The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) structural tegument protein pUL37, which 
is conserved across the Herpesviridae family, is known to be essential for
secondary envelopment during the egress of viral particles. To shed light on
additional roles of pUL37 during viral replication a yeast two-hybrid screen of a
human brain cDNA library was undertaken. This screen identified ten host cell
proteins as potential pUL37 interactors. One of the interactors, serine threonine
kinase TAOK3, was subsequently confirmed to interact with pUL37 using an in vitro
pulldown assay. Such host cell/pUL37 interactions provide further insights into
the multifunctional role of this herpesviral tegument protein.
