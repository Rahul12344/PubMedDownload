The RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is an interferon-induced, RNA-activated
enzyme that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha, rendering the
translation machinery inactive. Viruses have developed strategies for preventing 
the action of PKR, one of which is the production of small RNAs that inhibit the 
enzyme. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes EBER1, a 167 nucleotide non-coding RNA
that is constitutively expressed by the EBV-infected cells. EBER1 binds PKR in
vitro and has been shown to prevent inhibition of translation by PKR in vitro. We
used affinity cleavage by the EDTA.Fe-modified double-stranded RNA-binding domain
(dsRBD) of PKR to show that stem-loop IV (nucleotides 87-123) of EBER1 makes
specific contacts with the dsRBD. To further demonstrate the specificity of this 
interaction, we generated a deletion mutant of EBER1, comprising only stem-loop
IV (mEBER1). Cleavage patterns produced on mEBER1 by the bound dsRBD were
remarkably similar to those found on full-length EBER1. Using cleavage data from 
two different dsRBD mutants, we present a model of the interaction of PKR dsRBD
and mEBER1.
