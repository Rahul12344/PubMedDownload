Herpesviruses must cross the inner nuclear membrane and underlying lamina to exit
the nucleus. HSV-1 US3 and PKC can phosphorylate lamins and induce their
dispersion but do not elicit all of the phosphorylated lamin species produced
during infection. UL13 is a serine threonine protein kinase conserved among many 
herpesviruses. HSV-1 UL13 phosphorylates US3 and thereby controls UL31 and UL34
nuclear rim localization, indicating a role in nuclear egress. Here, we report
that HSV-2 UL13 alone induced conformational changes in lamins A and C and
redistributed lamin B1 from the nuclear rim to intranuclear granular structures. 
HSV-2 UL13 directly phosphorylated lamins A, C, and B1 in vitro, and the lamin A1
tail domain. HSV-2 infection recapitulated the lamin alterations seen upon
expression of UL13 alone, and other alterations were also observed, indicating
that additional viral and/or cellular proteins cooperate with UL13 to alter
lamins during HSV-2 infection to allow nuclear egress.
