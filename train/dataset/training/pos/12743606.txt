The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein stimulates cell growth and inhibits
differentiation by deregulating the normal transcription program via interaction 
with positive and negative cellular effectors. E1A associates with
transcriptional regulatory complexes containing p400 and TRRAP involved in
chromatin remodeling and decondensation. TRRAP is a component of three distinct
human histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes: the TIP60 complex and complexes 
containing GCN5 or PCAF. We demonstrate here that E1A binds a TRRAP complex that 
contains the GCN5 acetyltransferase during a normal adenovirus infection. E1A
binds GCN5 and TRRAP in vivo early after virus infection. E1A is associated with 
significant HAT activity in vitro that is partly attributable to GCN5. E1A
represses c-Myc- and E2F-1-directed transcriptional activation in vivo by
sequestering GCN5 and/or TRRAP. Our results demonstrate that E1A distinctly binds
TRRAP/GCN5, p300/CBP and PCAF HAT complexes. Through interactions with multiple
HAT complexes, E1A may deregulate cellular transcription programs and facilitate 
infection by recruiting functional HAT coactivators to viral and cellular
promoter regions.
