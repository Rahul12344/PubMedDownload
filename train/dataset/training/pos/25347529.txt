The HBx oncoprotein of hepatitis B Virus has been accredited as one of the
protagonists in driving hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx exerts its influence over the
cell cycle progression by potentiating the activity of cyclin A/E-CDK2 complex,
the Cyclin A partner of which is a well-known target of cellular deubiquitinase
USP37. In the present study, we observed the intracellular accumulation of cyclin
A and USP37 proteins under the HBx microenvironment. Flow cytometry analysis of
the HBx-expressing cells showed deregulation of cell cycle apparently due to the 
enhanced gene expression and stabilization of USP37 protein and deubiquitination 
of Cyclin A by USP37. Our co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic studies
suggested a direct interaction between USP37 and HBx. This interaction promoted
the translocation of USP37 outside the nucleus and prevented its association and 
ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases - APC/CDH1 and SCF/Î²-TrCP. Thus, HBx seems
to control the cell cycle progression via the cyclin A-CDK2 complex by regulating
the intracellular distribution and stability of deubiquitinase USP37.
