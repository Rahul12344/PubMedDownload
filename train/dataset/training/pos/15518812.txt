The viral proteins A1L, A2L, G8R, and H5R positively modulate vaccinia virus late
gene expression. Host-encoded proteins hnRNP A2 and RBM3 may also interact with
these viral factors to influence late gene expression. In these studies, a yeast 
two-hybrid screen and in vitro pulldown and crosslinking experiments were used to
investigate protein--protein interactions among these factors. These studies
confirmed a previous observation that G8R interacts with itself and A1L. However,
self-interactions of A1L and H5R, and interactions between A2L and G8R, A2L and
H5R, and H5R and G8R were also observed. In addition, the proteins hnRNP A2 and
RBM3 both showed some interaction with A2L. Illustration of these interactions is
a step toward understanding the architecture of the late gene transcription
complex as it occurs in poxviruses.
