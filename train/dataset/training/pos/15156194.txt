We previously reported, both in transfected cells and in human T-cell leukemia
virus type-2 subtype B infected cells, that the viral transactivator Tax-2B
protein could inhibit p53 functions. We have now investigated the mechanism
through which Tax-2B represses p53 using GFPTax-2B fusion proteins. We present
evidence that Tax-2B inhibition of p53 function is not linked to CREB/ATF
activation, but is uniquely correlated with the interaction of CREB binding
protein (CBP), but not p300, with the C-terminus of Tax-2B. Wild type, but not a 
Tax-2B-M47 mutant, inhibits p53 function in adherent cells. We demonstrate that
both Tax-2B and Tax-2B-M47 can bind p300, while Tax-2B-M47 is impaired for CBP
binding. Importantly, transfection of increasing amounts of CBP but not p300 or
p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) could rescue p53 transcriptional activity in
the presence of Tax-2B in nonlymphocytic cells. In lymphoid cells, Tax-2B
mediated inhibition of p53 is correlated with the NF-kappaB pathway activation
and could be prevented by the overexpression of an IkappaBalpha mutant. Given the
similarities between the functional domains of CBP and p300, these results are
intriguing and suggest that Tax-2B must bind the CR2 domain of CBP, but not that 
of p300 in order to repress p53.
