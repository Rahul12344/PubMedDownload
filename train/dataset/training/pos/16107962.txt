The binding of Norwalk virus (NV) recombinant capsids was tested in a panel of
saliva samples collected from 96 donors with different ABO, secretor, and Lewis
phenotypes. As previously reported, binding occurred specifically to saliva from 
secretors, regardless of their Lewis phenotype status. Blood group B saliva was
poorly recognized, whereas binding to blood group O saliva was higher and binding
to blood group A saliva was highest. Transfection of either blood group A or B
enzyme into H epitope-expressing cells showed that masking of H epitopes by the A
and B antigens blocked the attachment of NV capsids. The high level of binding to
blood group A secretor saliva could be explained by an optimal H type 1 ligand
density, which was lower than that in blood group O saliva and much higher than
that in blood group B saliva. Indeed, despite a higher ligand density, saliva
from homozygotes with 2 functional FUT2 alleles was less strongly recognized than
saliva from heterozygotes with 1 functional and 1 inactivated FUT2 allele.
Partial fucosidase treatment of duodenal tissue sections and binding to a
synthetic probe with varying densities of H type 1 trisaccharide indicated that
optimal attachment occurred at medium ligand density.
