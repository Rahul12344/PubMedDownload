HIV-1 integration is promoted by viral integrase (IN) and its cellular cofactors.
The lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75), an IN interacting cellular
cofactor, has been shown to play an important role in HIV-1 chromatin targeting
and integration. However, whether other cellular cofactors are also involved in
viral replication steps is still elusive. Here, we show that nucleoporin 62
(Nup62) is a chromatin-bound protein and can specifically interact with HIV-1 IN 
in both soluble nuclear extract and chromatin-bound fractions. The knockdown of
Nup62 by shRNA reduced the association of IN with host chromatin and
significantly impaired viral integration and replication in HIV-1-susceptible
cells. Furthermore, the expression of the IN-binding region of Nup62 in CD4(+) T 
cells significantly inhibited HIV-1 infection. Taken together, these results
indicate that the cellular Nup62 is specifically recruited by HIV-1 IN and
contribute to an efficient viral DNA integration.
