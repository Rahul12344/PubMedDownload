The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a critical role in the degradation of
short-lived and regulatory proteins in a variety of cellular processes. The F-box
proteins are part of the ubiquitin-ligase complexes, which mediate ubiquitination
and proteasome-dependent degradation of phosphorylated proteins. We previously
identified NFB42, an F-box protein that is highly enriched in the nervous system,
as a binding partner for the herpes simplex virus 1 UL9 protein, the viral
replication-initiator protein, in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In the present work,
we find that coexpression of NFB42 and UL9 genes in 293T cells leads to a
significant decrease in the level of UL9 protein. Treatment with the
26S-proteasome inhibitor MG132 restores the UL9 protein to normal levels. We have
observed also that the UL9 protein is polyubiquitinated in vivo and that the
interaction between NFB42 and the UL9 protein is dependent upon phosphorylation
of the UL9 protein. These results suggest that the interaction of the UL9 protein
with NFB42 results in its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the
26S proteasome. They suggest further a mechanism by which latency of herpes
simplex virus 1 can be established in neuronal cells.
