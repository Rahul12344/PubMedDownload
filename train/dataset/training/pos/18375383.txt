The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), gp41 core plays an important
role in fusion between viral and target cell membranes. We previously identified 
an HIV-1 gp41 core-binding motif HXXNPF (where X is any amino acid residue). In
this study, we found that Asn, Pro, and Phe were the key residues for gp41 core
binding. There are two NPF motifs in Epsin-1-(470-499), a fragment of Epsin,
which is an essential accessory factor of endocytosis that can dock to the plasma
membrane by interacting with the lipid. Epsin-1-(470-499) bound significantly to 
the gp41 core formed by the polypeptide N36(L8)C34 and interacted with the
recombinant soluble gp41 containing the core structure. A synthetic peptide
containing the Epsin-1-(470-499) sequence could effectively block entry of HIV-1 
virions into SupT1 T cells via the endocytosis pathway. These results suggest
that interaction between Epsin and the gp41 core, which may be present in the
target cell membrane, is probably essential for endocytosis of HIV-1, an
alternative pathway of HIV-1 entry into the target cell.
