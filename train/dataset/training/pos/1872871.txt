Phosphorylase kinase and calcium-free calmodulin are digested by human
immunodeficiency virus-1 protease. In phosphorylase kinase, the alpha subunit is 
preferentially hydrolyzed at arg748-val749. The beta subunit is cleaved only
slowly at leu678-pro679, and calmodulin, the integral delta subunit of
phosphorylase kinase, is not cleaved at all. However, free calmodulin in the
calcium-depleted form showed to be a good substrate for the protease. Here the
cleavage occurs at phe65-pro66 and met71-met72. This fast hydrolysis of free
calmodulin can be blocked by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ or millimolar
concentrations of Mg2+.
