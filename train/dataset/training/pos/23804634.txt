Most viruses possess strategies to circumvent host immune responses. The measles 
virus (MV) nonstructural C protein suppresses the interferon response, thereby
allowing efficient viral growth, but its detailed mechanism has been unknown. We 
identified Shc Src homology 2 domain-binding protein 1 (SHCBP1) as one of the
host proteins interacting with the C protein. Knockdown of SHCBP1 using a
short-hairpin RNA greatly reduced MV growth. SHCBP1 was found to be required for 
viral RNA synthesis in the minigenome assay and to bind to the MV phosphoprotein,
a subunit of the viral RNA polymerase. A stretch of 12 amino acid residues in the
C protein were sufficient for SHCBP1 binding, and the peptide containing these 12
residues could suppress MV RNA synthesis, like the full-length C protein. The
central region of SHCBP1 was found to bind to the C protein, as well as the
phosphoprotein, but the two viral proteins did not compete for SHCBP1 binding.
Our results indicate that the C protein modulates MV RNA polymerase activity by
binding to the host protein SHCBP1. SHCBP1 may be exploited as a target of
antiviral compounds.
