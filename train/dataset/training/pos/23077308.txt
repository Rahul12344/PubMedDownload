Ubiquitination/deubiquitination of key factors represent crucial steps in the
biogenesis of multivesicular body (MVB) and sorting of transmembrane proteins. We
and others previously demonstrated that MVB is involved in herpes simplex virus 1
(HSV-1) envelopment and budding. Here, we report that the HSV-1 large tegument
protein, VP1/2, interacts with and regulates the ubiquitination of Tsg101, a
cellular protein essential in MVB formation, thus identifying the first cellular 
substrate of a herpesviral deubiquitinating enzyme.
