Here, we show that human parainfluenza viruses and Sendai virus (SeV), like other
respiratory viruses, use TMPRSS2 for their activation. The membrane fusion
proteins of respiratory viruses often possess serine and glutamine residues at
the P2 and P3 positions, respectively, but these residues were not critical for
cleavage by TMPRSS2. However, mutations of these residues affected SeV growth in 
specific epithelial cell lines, suggesting the importance of these residues for
SeV replication in epithelia.
