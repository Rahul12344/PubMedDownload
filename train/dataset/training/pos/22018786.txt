Proteasomes represent the major non-lysosomal mechanism responsible for the
degradation of proteins. Following interferon γ treatment 3 proteasome subunits
are replaced producing immunoproteasomes. Adenovirus E1A interacts with
components of the 20S and 26S proteasome and can affect presentation of peptides.
In light of these observations we investigated the relationship of AdE1A to the
immunoproteasome. AdE1A interacts with the immunoproteasome subunit, MECL1. In
contrast, AdE1A binds poorly to the proteasome β2 subunit which is replaced by
MECL1 in the conversion of proteasomes to immunoproteasomes. Binding sites on E1A
for MECL1 correspond to the N-terminal region and conserved region 3.
Furthermore, AdE1A causes down-regulation of MECL1 expression, as well as LMP2
and LMP7, induced by interferon γ treatment during Ad infections or following
transient transfection. Consistent with previous reports AdE1A reduced
IFNγ-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation which appeared to be responsible for its
ability to reduce expression of immunoproteasome subunits.
