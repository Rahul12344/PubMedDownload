Many viruses modify cellular processes for their own benefit. The enterovirus 3A 
protein inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport, a function
previously suggested to be important for viral suppression of immune responses.
Here, we show that a virus carrying a 3A protein defective in inhibiting
ER-to-Golgi transport is indeed less virulent in mice, and we unravel the
mechanism by which 3A inhibits this trafficking step. Evidence is provided that
3A inhibits the activation of the GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), which 
regulates the recruitment of the COP-I coat complex to membranes. 3A specifically
inhibits the function of GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf1, by 
interacting with its N terminus. By specifically interfering with GBF1-mediated
Arf1 activation, 3A may prove a valuable tool in dissecting the early steps of
the secretory pathway.
