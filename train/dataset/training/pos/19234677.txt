Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease. However, the detailed 
mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with HCV is not yet completely
understood. We previously identified a novel C-type lectin--LSECtin predominantly
expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin
can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central
ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by
the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was
found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently
inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment. The present study suggests that
LSECtin interaction with DC-SIGNR might contribute to HCV binding to liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells.
