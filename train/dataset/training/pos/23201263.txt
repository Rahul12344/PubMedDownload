Tetherin/BST-2/CD317 inhibits HIV-1 release from infected cells, but the viral
Vpu protein efficiently antagonizes this antiviral activity through direct
interaction between the transmembrane (TM) domains of each protein. Here, we
demonstrated that overexpression of an inactive tetherin delGPI mutant, the TM
domain of which could competitively block Vpu targeting of endogenous tetherin,
potently inhibited HIV-1 release from human tetherin-positive cells in both
transient and stable expression conditions. These results also suggest that
heterologous dimerization occurred between the delGPI mutant and endogenous
tetherin. These findings suggest that blocking the Vpu/tetherin interface may be 
a novel therapeutic approach against HIV-1 release.
