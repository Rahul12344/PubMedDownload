The human polyomavirus JC (JCV) is the causative agent of the CNS demyelinating
disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Infection by JCV is
extremely common and after primary infection, JCV persists in a latent state.
However, PML is a very rare disease suggesting that the virus is tightly
regulated. Previously, we showed that NF-κB and C/EBPβ regulate the JCV early and
late promoters via a DNA control element, KB, which also mediates the stimulatory
effects of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α on JCV gene expression. Other 
studies have implicated NFAT4 in JCV regulation. We now report that NFAT4 and
NF-κB interact at the KB element to co-operatively activate both JCV early and
late transcription and viral DNA replication. This interplay is inhibited by
C/EBPβ and by agents that block the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. The
importance of these events in the regulation of JCV latency and reactivation is
discussed.
