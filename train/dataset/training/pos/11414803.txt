The adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) E1A12S oncoprotein utilizes the cAMP/protein kinase
A (PKA) signal transduction pathway to activate expression of the viral E2 gene, 
the products of which are essential for viral replication. A central unsolved
question is, however, whether E1A12S interacts directly with PKA in the process
of promoter activation. We show here that E1A12S binds to the regulatory subunits
(R) of PKA in vitro and in vivo. Interaction depends on the N-terminus and the
conserved region 1 (CR1) of E1A12S. Both domains are also essential for the
activation of viral E2 gene expression. Infection of cells with Ad12 leads to the
cellular redistribution of RIIalpha from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.
Furthermore, RIIalpha is also located in the nucleus of cells transformed by E1
of Ad12 and transient expression of E1A12S leads to the redistribution of
RIIalpha into the nucleus in a N-terminus- and CR1-dependent manner.
Cotransfection of E1A12S with RIIalpha results in strong activation of the E2
promoter. Based on these results we conclude that E1A12S functions as a viral
A-kinase anchoring protein redistributing RIIalpha from the cytoplasm into the
nucleus where it is involved in E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2 promoter.
