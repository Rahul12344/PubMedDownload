The innate immune system acts in the first line of host defense against
pathogens. One of the mechanisms used involves the early recognition and uptake
of microbes by host professional phagocytes, through pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind to conserved microbial ligands expressed by
pathogens and initiate both innate and adaptative immune responses. Some PRRs
located on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) and other cells seem to play an
important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission.
Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin, 
CD209 (DC-SIGN) and its homolog, DC-SIGN-related (DC-SIGNR or L-SIGN) receptors
are PPRs able to bind the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein and, because alterations
in their expression patterns also occur, they might play a role in both
horizontal and vertical transmission as well as in disseminating the virus within
the host. This review aims to explore the involvement of the DC-SIGN and L-SIGN
receptors in HIV-1 transmission from mother to child.
