Nuclear export and translation of intron-containing viral mRNAs are required for 
HIV-1 gene expression and replication. In this report, we provide evidence to
show that DDX3 regulates the translation of HIV-1 mRNAs. We found that knockdown 
of DDX3 expression effectively inhibited HIV-1 production. Translation of HIV-1
early regulatory proteins, Tat and rev, was impaired in DDX3-depleted cells. All 
HIV-1 transcripts share a highly structured 5' untranslated region (UTR) with
inhibitory elements on translation of viral mRNAs, yet DDX3 promoted translation 
of reporter mRNAs containing the HIV-1 5' UTR, especially with the
transactivation response (TAR) hairpin. Interestingly, DDX3 directly interacts
with HIV-1 Tat, a well-characterized transcriptional activator bound to the TAR
hairpin. HIV-1 Tat is partially targeted to cytoplasmic stress granules upon DDX3
overexpression or cell stress conditions, suggesting a potential role of Tat/DDX3
complex in translation. We further demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat remains associated
with translating mRNAs and facilitates translation of mRNAs containing the HIV-1 
5' UTR. Taken together, these findings indicate that DDX3 is recruited to the TAR
hairpin by interaction with viral Tat to facilitate HIV-1 mRNA translation.
