Protein kinase PKR (also known as EIF2AK2) is activated during viral infection
and phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 
2 (eIF2), leading to inhibition of translation and viral replication. We report
fast evolution of the PKR kinase domain in vertebrates, coupled with positive
selection of specific sites. Substitution of positively selected residues in
human PKR with residues found in related species altered sensitivity to PKR
inhibitors from different poxviruses. Species-specific differences in sensitivity
to poxviral pseudosubstrate inhibitors were identified between human and mouse
PKR, and these differences were traced to positively selected residues near the
eIF2alpha binding site. Our findings indicate how an antiviral protein evolved to
evade viral inhibition while maintaining its primary function. Moreover, the
identified species-specific differences in the susceptibility to viral inhibitors
have important implications for studying human infections in nonhuman model
systems.
