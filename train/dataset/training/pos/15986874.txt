The mechanisms of the attachment and penetration of hepatitis B virus remain
obscure. It has been demonstrated that the preS1 region is essential for viral
assembly and infectivity, however, as its cellular receptor has still not been
identified unequivocally, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen the
cellular proteins that can interact with preS1 protein. The protein recovered
from a human liver cDNA library was nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha 
polypeptide. The interaction between preS1 and nascent polypeptide-associated
complex alpha polypeptide was verified by mating experiment and
coimmunoprecipitation of COS7 cell lysates expressing both proteins. Based on
these results, we speculate that nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha
polypeptide is a functional target of hepatitis B virus preS1 protein in cells.
