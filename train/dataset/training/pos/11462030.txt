Degradation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by the human papillomavirus
type 16 E7 oncoprotein is important for functional inactivation and is separable 
from proteasomal degradation of E7.

The steady-state level and metabolic half-life of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
protein pRB are decreased in cells that express high-risk human papillomavirus
(HPV) E7 proteins. Here we show that pRB degradation is a direct activity of E7
and does not reflect a property of cell lines acquired during the selection
process for E7 expression. An amino-terminal domain of E7 that does not directly 
contribute to pRB binding but is required for transformation is also necessary
for E7-mediated pRB degradation. Treatment with inhibitors of the 26S proteasome 
not only blocks E7-mediated pRB degradation but also causes the stabilization of 
E7. Mutagenic analyses, however, reveal that the processes of proteasomal
degradation of E7 and pRB are not linked processes. HPV type 16 E7 also targets
the pRB-related proteins p107 and p130 for destabilization by a
proteasome-dependent mechanism. Using the SAOS2 flat-cell assay as a biological
indicator for pRB function, we demonstrate that pRB degradation, not solely
binding, is important for the E7-induced inactivation of pRB.
