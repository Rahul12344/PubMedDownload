Decay accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) is targeted by many pathogens for cell
entry. It has been implicated as a co-receptor for hantaviruses. To examine the
binding of hantaviruses to DAF, we describe the use of Protein G beads for
binding human IgG Fc domain-functionalized DAF ((DAF)₂-Fc). When mixed with
Protein G beads the resulting DAF beads can be used as a generalizable platform
for measuring kinetic and equilibrium binding constants of DAF binding targets.
The hantavirus interaction has high affinity (24-30 nM; k(on) ~ 10⁵ M⁻¹ s⁻¹,
k(off) ~ 0.0045 s⁻¹). The bivalent (DAF)₂-Fc/SNV data agree with hantavirus
binding to DAF expressed on Tanoue B cells (K(d) = 14.0 nM). Monovalent affinity 
interaction between SNV and recombinant DAF of 58.0 nM is determined from
competition binding. This study serves a dual purpose of presenting a convenient 
and quantitative approach of measuring binding affinities between DAF and the
many cognate viral and bacterial ligands and providing new data on the binding
constant of DAF and Sin Nombre hantavirus. Knowledge of the equilibrium binding
constant allows for the determination of the relative fractions of bound and free
virus particles in cell entry assays. This is important for drug discovery assays
for cell entry inhibitors.
