Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower
respiratory tract infection. Infection is critically dependent on the RSV fusion 
(F) protein, which mediates fusion between the viral envelope and airway
epithelial cells. The F protein is also expressed on infected cells and is
responsible for fusion of infected cells with adjacent cells, resulting in the
formation of multinucleate syncytia. The receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE) is a pattern-recognition receptor that is constitutively highly
expressed by type I alveolar epithelial cells. Here, we report that RAGE
protected HEK cells from RSV-induced cell death and reduced viral titres in
vitro. RAGE appeared to interact directly with the F protein, but, rather than
inhibiting RSV entry into host cells, virus replication and budding,
membrane-expressed RAGE or soluble RAGE blocked F-protein-mediated syncytium
formation and sloughing. These data indicate that RAGE may contribute to
protecting the lower airways from RSV by inhibiting the formation of syncytia,
viral spread, epithelial damage and airway obstruction.
