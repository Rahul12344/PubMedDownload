Employing the yeast two-hybrid system, the Tat protein of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was shown to interact with a region spanning the
EGF-like repeats 1-6 of the mouse Notch1, the human Notch2 and the Drosophila
Notch. This observation was confirmed in mammalian cells by demonstrating an
interaction between the HIV Tat and the EGF-like repeats 1-6 of the various Notch
proteins. The HIV Tat protein interacted also with the full-length mouse Notch1
receptor when co-expressed in mammalian cells. Moreover, the HIV Tat protein
interacted also with the EGF-like repeats 1-4-spanning domain of the human EGF
precursor. The ability of the HIV Tat protein to interact with the Notch proteins
and possibly with other EGF-like repeats-bearing proteins, suggests that such
interactions might modulate their physiological functions, thus affecting various
AIDS-associated pathologies.
