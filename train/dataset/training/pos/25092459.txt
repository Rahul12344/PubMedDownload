Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a considerable global health and economic burden. The 
HCV nonstructural protein (NS) 5A is essential for the viral life cycle. The
ability of NS5A to interact with different host and viral proteins allow it to
manipulate cellular pathways and regulate viral processes, including RNA
replication and virus particle assembly. As part of a proteomic screen, we
identified several NS5A-binding proteins, including the lysine methyltransferase 
SET and MYND domain containing protein 3 (SMYD3). We confirmed the interaction in
the context of viral replication by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization
studies. Mutational analyses revealed that the MYND-domain of SMYD3 and domain
III of NS5A are required for the interaction. Overexpression of SMYD3 resulted in
decreased intracellular and extracellular virus titers, whilst viral RNA
replication remained unchanged, suggesting that SMYD3 negatively affects HCV
particle production in a NS5A-dependent manner.
