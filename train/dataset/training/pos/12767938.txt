As most transcription factors, GATA-1 activities are mediated by interactions
with multiple proteins. Those identified so far associate with the zinc-finger
domain and/or surrounding sequences. In contrast, no proteins interacting with
the N-terminal domain have been identified although several evidences suggest its
involvement in the control of hematopoiesis. In an attempt to identify proteins
that interact with the N-terminal transactivation domain of GATA-1, a random
phage peptide library was screened with recombinant GATA-1 protein and the
sequence of a selected peptide was used for database protein sequence retrieval. 
We selected a set of peptides sharing the core sequence phi-B((2-3))-nu((2-4))
(where phi, B, and nu represent hydrophobic, basic, and neutral residues,
respectively). Using the sequence of the most represented peptide (pep5) as
query, we retrieved the HIV accessory protein Nef. We show that Nef binds GATA-1 
and GATA-3 in vitro in virtue of its sequence homology with pep5.
