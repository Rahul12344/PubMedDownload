Human cells possess an antiviral activity that inhibits the release of retrovirus
particles, and other enveloped virus particles, and is antagonized by the HIV-1
accessory protein, Vpu. This antiviral activity can be constitutively expressed
or induced by interferon-alpha, and it consists of protein-based tethers, which
we term 'tetherins', that cause retention of fully formed virions on infected
cell surfaces. Using deductive constraints and gene expression analyses, we
identify CD317 (also called BST2 or HM1.24), a membrane protein of previously
unknown function, as a tetherin. Specifically, CD317 expression correlated with, 
and induced, a requirement for Vpu during HIV-1 and murine leukaemia virus
particle release. Furthermore, in cells where HIV-1 virion release requires Vpu
expression, depletion of CD317 abolished this requirement. CD317 caused retention
of virions on cell surfaces and, after endocytosis, in CD317-positive
compartments. Vpu co-localized with CD317 and inhibited these effects. Inhibition
of Vpu function and consequent mobilization of tetherin's antiviral activity is a
potential therapeutic strategy in HIV/AIDS.
