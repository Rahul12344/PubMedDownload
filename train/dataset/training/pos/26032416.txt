Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr is an accessory protein that induces G2/M
cell cycle arrest. It is well documented that interaction of Vpr with the
Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase is essential for the induction of G2/M
arrest. In this study, we show that HIV-1 Vpr indirectly binds MCM10, a
eukaryotic DNA replication factor, in a Vpr-binding protein (VprBP)
(VprBP)-dependent manner. Binding of Vpr to MCM10 enhanced ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of MCM10. G2/M-defective mutants of Vpr were not able to 
deplete MCM10, and we show that Vpr-induced depletion of MCM10 is related to the 
ability of Vpr to induce G2/M arrest. Our study demonstrates that MCM10 is the
natural substrate of the Cul4-DDB1[VprBP] E3 ubiquitin ligase whose degradation
is regulated by VprBP, but Vpr enhances the proteasomal degradation of MCM10 by
interacting with VprBP.
