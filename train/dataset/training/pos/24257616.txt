Conjugation of ISG15 inhibits replication of several viruses. Here, using an
expression system for assaying human and mouse ISG15 conjugations (ISGylations), 
we have demonstrated that vaccinia virus E3 protein binds and antagonizes human
and mouse ISG15 modification. To study ISGylation importance in poxvirus
infection, we used a mouse model that expresses deconjugating proteases. Our
results indicate that ISGylation restricts in vitro replication of the vaccinia
virus VVΔE3L mutant but unconjugated ISG15 is crucial to counteract the
inflammatory response produced after VVΔE3L infection.
