Viruses have evolved various strategies to escape the antiviral activity of type 
I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta). For measles virus, this function is carried by
the polycistronic gene P that encodes, by an unusual editing strategy, for the
phosphoprotein P and the virulence factor V (MV-V). MV-V prevents STAT1 nuclear
translocation by either sequestration or phosphorylation inhibition, thereby
blocking IFN-alpha/beta pathway. We show that both the N- and C-terminal domains 
of MV-V (PNT and VCT) contribute to the inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta signaling.
Using the two-hybrid system and co-affinity purification experiments, we
identified STAT1 and Jak1 as interactors of MV-V and demonstrate that MV-V can
block the direct phosphorylation of STAT1 by Jak1. A deleterious mutation within 
the PNT domain of MV-V (Y110H) impaired its ability to interact and block STAT1
phosphorylation. Thus, MV-V interacts with at least two components of
IFN-alpha/beta receptor complex to block downstream signaling.
