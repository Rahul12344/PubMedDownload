Walleye dermal sarcoma virus encodes a retroviral cyclin (rv-cyclin) with a
cyclin box fold and transcription activation domain (AD). Co-immune precipitation
(co-IP) identified an association of rv-cyclin with cyclin-dependent kinase 8
(cdk8). Cdk8 is dependent upon cyclin C and regulates transcription with the
Mediator complex, a co-activator of transcription. Mutation of cyclin residues,
required for cdk binding, disrupts rv-cyclin-cdk8 co-IP. Mutation or removal of
the AD has no effect on cdk8 interaction. Direct rv-cyclin-cdk8 binding is
demonstrated by pulldown of active cdk8 and by GST-rv-cyclin binding to
recombinant cdk8. Cdk3 is also activated by cyclin C and phosphorylates
retinoblastoma protein to initiate entry into the cell division cycle. Co-IP and 
pulldowns demonstrate direct rv-cyclin binding to cdk3 as well. The rv-cyclin
functions as a structural ortholog of cyclin C in spite of its limited amino acid
sequence identity with C cyclins or with any known cyclins.
