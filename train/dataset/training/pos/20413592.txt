DNA cytosine methylation in the bovine leukemia virus promoter is associated with
latency in a lymphoma-derived B-cell line: potential involvement of direct
inhibition of cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein/CRE
modulator/activation transcription factor binding.

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) proviral latency represents a viral strategy to
escape the host immune system and allow tumor development. Besides the previously
demonstrated role of histone deacetylation in the epigenetic repression of BLV
expression, we showed here that BLV promoter activity was induced by several DNA 
methylation inhibitors (such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and that overexpressed
DNMT1 and DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, down-regulated BLV promoter activity.
Importantly, cytosine hypermethylation in the 5'-long terminal repeat (LTR) U3
and R regions was associated with true latency in the lymphoma-derived B-cell
line L267 but not with defective latency in YR2 cells. Moreover, the
virus-encoded transactivator Tax(BLV) decreased DNA methyltransferase expression 
levels, which could explain the lower level of cytosine methylation observed in
the L267(LTaxSN) 5'-LTR compared with the L267 5'-LTR. Interestingly, DNA
methylation inhibitors and Tax(BLV) synergistically activated BLV promoter
transcriptional activity in a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-dependent manner.
Mechanistically, methylation at the -154 or -129 CpG position (relative to the
transcription start site) impaired in vitro binding of CRE-binding protein (CREB)
transcription factors to their respective CRE sites. Methylation at -129 CpG
alone was sufficient to decrease BLV promoter-driven reporter gene expression by 
2-fold. We demonstrated in vivo the recruitment of CREB/CRE modulator (CREM) and 
to a lesser extent activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) to the
hypomethylated CRE region of the YR2 5'-LTR, whereas we detected no CREB/CREM/ATF
recruitment to the hypermethylated corresponding region in the L267 cells.
Altogether, these findings suggest that site-specific DNA methylation of the BLV 
promoter represses viral transcription by directly inhibiting transcription
factor binding, thereby contributing to true proviral latency.
