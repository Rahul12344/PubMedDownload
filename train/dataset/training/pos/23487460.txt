Epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces impose multiple barriers to viral
infection. At the ocular surface, the carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3
maintains barrier function by cross-linking transmembrane mucins on the apical
glycocalyx. Despite these defense mechanisms, many viruses have evolved to
exploit fundamental cellular processes on host cells. Here, we use affinity
assays to show that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but not HSV-2, binds
human galectin-3. Knockdown of galectin-3 in human corneal keratinocytes by small
interfering RNA significantly impaired HSV-1 infection, but not expression of
nectin-1, indicating that galectin-3 is a herpesvirus entry mediator.
Interestingly, exposure of epithelial cell cultures to transmembrane mucin
isolates decreased viral infectivity. Moreover, HSV-1 failed to elute the
biological counterreceptor MUC16 from galectin-3 affinity columns, suggesting
that association of transmembrane mucins to galectin-3 provides protection
against viral infection. Together, these results indicate that HSV-1 exploits
galectin-3 to enhance virus attachment to host cells and support a protective
role for transmembrane mucins under physiological conditions by masking viral
entry mediators on the epithelial glycocalyx.
