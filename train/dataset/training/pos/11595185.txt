Like other enveloped viruses, HIV-1 uses cellular machinery to bud from infected 
cells. We now show that Tsg101 protein, which functions in vacuolar protein
sorting (Vps), is required for HIV-1 budding. The UEV domain of Tsg101 binds to
an essential tetrapeptide (PTAP) motif within the p6 domain of the structural Gag
protein and also to ubiquitin. Depletion of cellular Tsg101 by small interfering 
RNA arrests HIV-1 budding at a late stage, and budding is rescued by
reintroduction of Tsg101. Dominant negative mutant Vps4 proteins that inhibit
vacuolar protein sorting also arrest HIV-1 and MLV budding. These observations
suggest that retroviruses bud by appropriating cellular machinery normally used
in the Vps pathway to form multivesicular bodies.
