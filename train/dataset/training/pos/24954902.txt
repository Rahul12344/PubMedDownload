DNA damage associated with viral DNA synthesis can result in double-strand breaks
that threaten genome integrity and must be repaired. Here, we establish that the 
cellular Fanconi anemia (FA) genomic stability pathway is exploited by herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) to promote viral DNA synthesis and enable its productive 
growth. Potent FA pathway activation in HSV-1-infected cells resulted in
monoubiquitination of FA effector proteins FANCI and FANCD2 (FANCI-D2) and
required the viral DNA polymerase. FANCD2 relocalized to viral replication
compartments, and FANCI-D2 interacted with a multisubunit complex containing the 
virus-encoded single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8. Significantly, whereas
HSV-1 productive growth was impaired in monoubiquitination-defective FA cells,
this restriction was partially surmounted by antagonizing the DNA-dependent
protein kinase (DNA-PK), a critical enzyme required for nonhomologous end-joining
(NHEJ). This identifies the FA-pathway as a cellular factor required for
herpesvirus productive growth and suggests that FA-mediated suppression of NHEJ
is a fundamental step in the viral life cycle.
