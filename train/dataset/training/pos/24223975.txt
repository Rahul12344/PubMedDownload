In the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigen processing and
presentation pathway, the antigenic peptides are generated from viral proteins by
multiple proteolytic cleavages of the proteasome (and in some cases other
cytosolic proteases) and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen
where they are exposed to aminopeptidase activity. In human cells, two different 
ER-resident enzymes, ERAP1 and ERAP2, can trim the N-terminally extended residues
of peptide precursors. In this study, the possible cooperative effect of
generating five naturally processed HLA-B27 ligands by both proteases was
analyzed. We identified differences in the products obtained with increased
detection of natural HLA-B27 ligands by comparing double versus single enzyme
digestions by mass spectrometry analysis. These in vitro data suggest that each
enzyme can use the degradation products of the other as a substrate for new
N-terminal trimming, indicating concerted aminoproteolytic activity of ERAP 1 and
ERAP2.
