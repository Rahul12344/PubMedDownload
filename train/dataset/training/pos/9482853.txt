Replication of HIV-1 requires the viral Tat protein, which increases the extent
of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II after activation at the single
viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. This effect of Tat on transcription
requires Tat interactions with a 5' region (TAR) in nascent transcripts as well
as Tat-specific cofactors. The present study identifies a cellular protein,
TIP30, that interacts with Tat and with an SRB-containing RNA polymerase II
complex both in vivo and in vitro. Coexpression of TIP30 specifically enhances
transactivation by Tat in transfected cells, and immunodepletion of TIP30 from
nuclear extracts abolishes Tat-activated transcription without affecting
Tat-independent transcription. These results implicate TIP30 as a specific
coactivator that may enhance formation of a Tat-RNA polymerase II holoenzyme
complex.
