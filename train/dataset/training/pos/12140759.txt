The E6 proteins from the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types have
previously been shown to target a number of PDZ domain-containing proteins for
proteasome-mediated degradation. These include the hDlg tumour suppressor and the
MAGI-1 protein. In this study we show that high-risk HPV E6 proteins also target 
the related MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 proteins for degradation. Moreover, we show that
the interaction is specific to one PDZ domain, and that co-expression of this
domain can protect each of the full-length MAGI proteins from E6-mediated
degradation. These data provide clear indicators for the potential design of
compounds that could specifically inhibit the interaction of oncogenic HPV E6
proteins with an important class of target proteins.
