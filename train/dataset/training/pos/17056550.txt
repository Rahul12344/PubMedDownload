In contrast to MHC molecules, which present peptides, the CD1 molecules have been
discovered to present lipid Ags to T cells. CD1-restricted T lymphocytes have
been recently associated with resistance to virus infection. The mechanisms
underlying activation of CD1-restricted T cells in the course of virus infection 
are not defined. In this study, we wanted to investigate the interaction of HSV
with the antiviral CD1 Ag presentation system in human dendritic cells (DC). In
response to low titers of HSV, the surface expression of CD1b and CD1d on human
DC was up-regulated. These phenotypic changes enhanced the capacity of infected
DC to stimulate proliferation of CD1-restricted T lymphocytes. High titers of
HSV, however, lead to strong down-regulation of all surface CD1 molecules. This
modulation of surface expression was associated with intracellular accumulation, 
colocalization with viral proteins, and disruption of the CD1 recycling
machinery. Finally, even at low titers HSV interfered with the capacity of
infected DC to stimulate the release of important cytokines by CD1d-restricted
NKT cells. Thus, we demonstrate both the existence of a CD1 pathway allowing
human DC to react to viral infection, as well as its blockage by a human
herpesvirus.
