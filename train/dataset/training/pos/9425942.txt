Hepatitis B virus-encoded X antigen contributes to the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Given that X antigen functions by binding to other
proteins, additional X-binding proteins were sought from an adult human liver
cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. The results yielded a clone encoding a
55-kd protein that is associated with replicative senescence (p55sen). Binding of
p55sen to X antigen was confirmed in vitro by immunoprecipitation and affinity
chromatography. The expression of endogenous p55sen inversely correlated with
cell growth. Transient transfection of X antigen or p55sen into HepG2 cells
stimulated DNA synthesis by twofold to threefold, whereas cotransfection did not,
suggesting that these molecules functionally interact. The detection of p55sen in
embryonic mouse liver, its absence in adult mouse and human livers, and its
reappearance in livers from carriers with chronic liver disease, suggest that it 
may play important roles in the regulation of liver cell growth. The similarity
between p55sen and a notch ligand, which is involved in cell fate determinations 
during embryogenesis, implies that the binding of p55sen by X antigen may also
contribute to an alteration in cell fate, which is characteristic of
carcinogenesis.
