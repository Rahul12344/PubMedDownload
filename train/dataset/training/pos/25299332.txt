Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense single-stranded genomic (g) RNA, which
encodes nonstructural proteins. Several subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding
structural proteins are generated by template switching from the body
transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) to the leader TRS. The process
preferentially generates shorter sgmRNA. Appropriate readthrough of body TRSs is 
required to produce longer sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA. We find that
phosphorylation of the viral nucleocapsid (N) by host glycogen synthase kinase-3 
(GSK-3) is required for template switching. GSK-3 inhibition selectively reduces 
the generation of gRNA and longer sgmRNAs, but not shorter sgmRNAs. N
phosphorylation allows recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 to the
phosphorylated-N-containing complex, which facilitates template readthrough and
enables longer sgmRNA synthesis. DDX1 knockdown or loss of helicase activity
markedly reduces the levels of longer sgmRNAs. Thus, coronaviruses employ a
unique strategy for the transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription
to ensure balanced sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA synthesis.
