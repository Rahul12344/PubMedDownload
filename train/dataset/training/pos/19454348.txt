The ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 mediates Lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of the
N-terminal CARD domains of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I to facilitate type I
interferon (IFN) production and antiviral immunity. Here, we report that the
influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) specifically inhibits
TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, thereby suppressing RIG-I signal
transduction. A novel domain in NS1 comprising E96/E97 residues mediates its
interaction with the coiled-coil domain of TRIM25, thus blocking TRIM25
multimerization and RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination. Furthermore, a recombinant 
influenza A virus expressing an E96A/E97A NS1 mutant is defective in blocking
TRIM25-mediated antiviral IFN response and loses virulence in mice. Our findings 
reveal a mechanism by which influenza virus inhibits host IFN response and also
emphasize the vital role of TRIM25 in modulating antiviral defenses.
