The E6 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) has been shown to
transform cells through a p53-independent pathway, but its transforming mechanism
is unknown. Here we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo interactions between BPV-1
E6 and the focal adhesion protein paxillin. The ability of BPV-1 E6 to complex
with paxillin correlated with its ability to transform; E6 mutant proteins
impaired in their transformation function also were impaired in their abilities
to bind paxillin. E6 binding to paxillin also may contribute to the carcinogenic 
potential of the human papillomavirus (HPV); we were able to show in vitro
binding of paxillin to the E6 proteins of the cancer-associated type HPV 16 but
not of the nononcogenic types 6 and 11. The association of E6 with paxillin was
affected by depolymerization of the actin fiber network, and overexpression of
BPV-1 E6 led to disruption of actin fiber formation. Disruption of the actin
cytoskeleton is a characteristic of many transformed cells, and, in BPV-1
transformed cells, may be mediated by BPV-1 E6 through its interaction with
paxillin.
