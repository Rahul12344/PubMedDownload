The HIV-1 genome contains several genes coding for auxiliary proteins, including 
the small Vpr protein. Vpr affects the integrity of the nuclear envelope and
participates in the nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex
containing the viral DNA. Here, we show by photobleaching experiments performed
on living cells expressing a Vpr-green fluorescent protein fusion that the
protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but a significant
fraction is concentrated at the nuclear envelope, supporting the hypothesis that 
Vpr interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex. An interaction between
HIV-1 Vpr and the human nucleoporin CG1 (hCG1) was revealed in the yeast
two-hybrid system, and then confirmed both in vitro and in transfected cells.
This interaction does not involve the FG repeat domain of hCG1 but rather the
N-terminal region of the protein. Using a nuclear import assay based on
digitonin-permeabilized cells, we demonstrate that hCG1 participates in the
docking of Vpr at the nuclear envelope. This association of Vpr with a component 
of the nuclear pore complex may contribute to the disruption of the nuclear
envelope and to the nuclear import of the viral DNA.
