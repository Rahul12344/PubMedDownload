BACKGROUND: Oncoproteins encoded by the early region of adenoviruses have been
shown to be powerful tools to study gene regulatory mechanisms, which affect
major cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and
oncogenic transformation. They are possesing a key role to favor viral
replication via their interaction with multiple cellular proteins. In a yeast
two-hybrid screen we have identified Sprouty1 (Spry1) as a target of adenoviral
E1A Oncoproteins. Spry proteins are central and complex regulators of the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling pathway. The deregulation of Spry
family members is often associated with alterations of the RTK signalling and its
downstream effectors, leading to the ERK pathway.
RESULTS: Here, we confirm our yeast two-hybrid data, showing the interaction
between Spry1 and E1A in GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays. We also
demonstrated the interaction of E1A with two further Spry isoforms. Using
deletion mutants we identified the N-terminus and the CR conserved region (CR) 3 
of E1A- and the C-terminal half of Spry1, which contains the highly conserved
Spry domain, as the essential sites for direct interaction between Spry and E1A. 
Immunofluorescent microscopy data revealed a co-localization of E1A(13S) with
Spry1 in the cytoplasm. SRE and TRE reporter assays demonstrated that
co-expression of Spry1 with E1A(13S) abolishes the inhibitory function of Spry1
in RTK signalling, which is consequently accompanied with a decrease of
E1A13S-induced gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results establish Spry1 as a cytoplasmic localized cellular
target for E1A oncoproteins to regulate the RTK signalling pathway, and
consequently cellular events downstream of RTK that are essential for viral
replication and transformation.
