The US11 gene product of human cytomegalovirus promotes viral immune evasion by
hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.
US11 initiates dislocation of newly translocated MHC I from the ER to the cytosol
for proteasome-mediated degradation. Despite the critical role for ubiquitin in
this degradation pathway, the responsible E3 ligase is unknown. In a forward
genetic screen for host ERAD components hijacked by US11 in near-haploid KBM7
cells, we identified TMEM129, an uncharacterized polytopic membrane protein.
TMEM129 is essential and rate-limiting for US11-mediated MHC-I degradation and
acts as a novel ER resident E3 ubiquitin ligase. TMEM129 contains an unusual
cysteine-only RING with intrinsic E3 ligase activity and is recruited to US11 via
Derlin-1. Together with its E2 conjugase Ube2J2, TMEM129 is responsible for the
ubiquitination, dislocation, and subsequent degradation of US11-associated MHC-I.
US11 engages two degradation pathways: a Derlin-1/TMEM129-dependent pathway
required for MHC-I degradation and a SEL1L/HRD1-dependent pathway required for
"free" US11 degradation. Our data show that TMEM129 is a novel ERAD E3 ligase and
the central component of a novel mammalian ERAD complex.
