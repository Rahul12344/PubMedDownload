The herpes simplex virus UL56 gene product is a C-terminal-anchored, type II
membrane protein of unknown function. UL56 was found to interact with KIF1A, a
member of the kinesin-3 family, in a yeast two-hybrid screen and a GST pull-down 
assay. KIF1A mediates the transport of synaptic vesicle precursors and is
essential for the function and viability of neurons. When overexpressed, KIF1A
co-localized with full-sized UL56, but no clear co-localization was observed when
co-expressed with the UL56 mutant protein lacking its C-terminal transmembrane
domain (TMD). Although the C-terminal TMD was not essential for the interaction
with KIF1A in the yeast two-hybrid screen and GST pull-down assays, these results
indicate that the C-terminal TMD, as well as aa 69-217, of UL56 are important for
the interaction with KIF1A in vivo. The hypothesis that the UL56 protein affects 
vesicular trafficking in infected cells, potentially by acting as a receptor for 
motor proteins in neurons, is discussed.
