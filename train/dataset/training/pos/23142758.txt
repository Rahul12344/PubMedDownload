Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes heavy economic losses to poultry industry
across the globe every year. Although NDV matrix (M) protein is involved in virus
budding and our previous data indicate that in ovo expression of M protein
facilitates NDV replication, the underlying mechanism for the role of M protein
in NDV replication is not clear. Using yeast two-hybrid system and
immunoprecipitation approaches, we found that M protein interacted with host
vacuolar sorting protein charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) 4B and 4C. In
addition, the colocalization of M protein and CHMP4B/C could be observed using a 
laser confocal scanning microscope. Knockdown of CHMP4B by siRNA or transient
expression of CHMP4B/C dominant negative forms markedly inhibited NDV growth in
DF-1 cells. Thus, cellular CHMP4s play a critical role in NDV replication.
