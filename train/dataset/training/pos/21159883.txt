Poxviruses encode numerous proteins that inhibit apoptosis, a form of cell death 
critical to the elimination of virally infected cells. Sequencing of the deerpox 
virus genome revealed DPV022, a protein that lacks obvious homology to cellular
members of the Bcl-2 family but shares limited regions of amino acid identity
with two unique poxviral inhibitors of apoptosis, M11L and F1L. Given the limited
homology, we sought to determine whether DPV022 could inhibit apoptosis. Here we 
show that DPV022 localized to the mitochondria, where it inhibited apoptosis. We 
used a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system to demonstrate that in the absence
of all other Bcl-2 family proteins, DPV022 interacted directly with Bak and Bax. 
We confirmed the ability of DPV022 to interact with Bak and Bax by
immunoprecipitation and showed that DPV022 prevented apoptosis induced by Bak and
Bax overexpression. Moreover, we showed that DPV022 blocked apoptosis even when
all the endogenous mammalian antiapoptotic proteins were neutralized by a
combination of selective BH3 ligands. During virus infection, DPV022 interacted
with endogenous Bak and Bax and prevented the conformational activation of both
of them. Thus, we have characterized a novel poxviral inhibitor of apoptosis with
intriguing amino acid differences from the well-studied proteins M11L and F1L.
