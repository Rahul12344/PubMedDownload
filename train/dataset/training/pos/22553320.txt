Transfer of the UAP56 interaction motif of human cytomegalovirus pUL69 to its
murine cytomegalovirus homolog converts the protein into a functional mRNA export
factor that can substitute for pUL69 during viral infection.

Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and interaction with the cellular mRNA export factor 
UAP56 are prerequisites for the mRNA export activity of human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) pUL69. Although the murine cytomegalovirus homolog pM69 shuttles, it fails
to export mRNAs due to its inability to recruit UAP56. However, chimeric proteins
comprising pM69 fused to N-terminal pUL69 fragments, including its UAP56
interaction motif, acquire mRNA export activity. Importantly, growth curves of
recombinant HCMVs illustrate that such a chimeric protein, but not pM69,
substitutes for pUL69 during HCMV infection.
