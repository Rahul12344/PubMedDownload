HBV X protein is a transactivator of several cellular signaling pathways
including Wnt which contributes to HBV associated neoplasia. The Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is associated with HCC-initiating cells. Here we perform a functional
screen for host factors involved in the transactivational properties of HBx. We
identify adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) as a binding partner of HBx and further
determine that HBx competitively binds APC to displace β-catenin from its
degradation complex. This results in β-catenin upregulation in the nucleus and
the activation of Wnt signaling. We show that Wnt inhibitors curcumin and
quercetin target downstream β-catenin activity and effectively repress
HBx-mediated regulation of c-MYC and E-cadherin. Our results provide a
pathological mechanism of HBx induced malignant transformation.
