Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of blood-borne non-A non-B
hepatitis and a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
worldwide. HCV core protein is a multifunctional protein with regulatory
functions in cellular transcription and virus-induced transformation and
pathogenesis. Here we report on the identification of a bZIP nuclear
transcription protein as an HCV core cofactor for transformation. This bZIP
factor, designated LZIP, activates CRE-dependent transcription and regulates cell
proliferation. Loss of LZIP function in NIH 3T3 cells triggers morphological
transformation and anchorage-independent growth. We show that HCV core protein
aberrantly sequesters LZIP in the cytoplasm, inactivates LZIP function and
potentiates cellular transformation. Our findings suggest that LZIP might serve a
novel cellular tumor suppressor function that is targeted by the HCV core.
