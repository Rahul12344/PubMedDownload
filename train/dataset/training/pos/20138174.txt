Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) activates NF-kappaB signaling
pathways through two C-terminal regions, CTAR1 and CTAR2. Previous studies have
demonstrated that BS69, a multidomain cellular protein, regulates
LMP1/CTAR2-mediated NF-kappaB activation by interfering with the complex
formation between TRADD and LMP1/CTAR2. Here, we found that BS69 directly
interacted with the LMP1/CTAR1 domain and regulated LMP1/CTAR1-mediated NF-kappaB
activation and subsequent IL-6 production. Regarding the mechanisms involved, we 
found that BS69 directly interacted with TRAF3, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB
activation. Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown experiments
revealed that TRAF3 was involved in the BS69-mediated suppression of
LMP1/CTAR1-induced NF-kappaB activation.
