Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult
T-cell leukemia (ATL). HTLV-1 encodes the oncoprotein Tax1, which is essential
for immortalization of human T-cells and persistent HTLV-1 infection in vivo.
Tax1 has a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at its C-terminus. This motif is crucial for
the transforming activity of Tax1 to a T-cell line and persistent HTLV-1
infection. Tax1 through the PBM interacts with PDZ domain proteins such as Dlg1
and Scribble, but it has not been determined yet, which cellular PDZ proteins
mediate the functions of Tax1 PBM. Here we demonstrate that Tax1 interacts with
the PDZ domain protein MAGI-1 in a PBM-dependent manner, and the interaction
mislocalizes MAGI-1 from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble
cellular fraction in 293T cells and in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. In addition,
Tax1-transformation of a T-cell line from interleukin (IL)-2-dependent to
IL-2-independent growth selects cells with irreversibly reduced expression of
MAGI-1 at mRNA level. These findings imply that Tax1, like other viral
oncoproteins, targets MAGI-1 as a mechanism to suppress its anti-tumor functions 
in HTLV-1-infected cells to contribute to the transforming activity of T-cells
and persistent HTLV-1 infection.
