The Nef from a highly virulent strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV),
SIVpbj14, and a Nef from the traditional strain SIVmac239 bearing the mutation
from RQ to YE (YE-Nef) both induce an acute lethal disease in monkeys. The YE
mutation and its surrounding sequence resemble the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
activation motif (ITAM), which is present in the cytoplasmic tail of T- and
B-cell antigen receptors and mediates signaling during lymphocyte activation. We 
show here that the ITAM from YE-Nef performs the same function. First, not only
does YE-Nef increase the activity of the transcription factor NFAT, which is one 
of the downstream targets of T-cell activation, but the ITAM from the YE-Nef by
itself also activates NFAT. Second, the ITAM from YE-Nef is phosphorylated on
tyrosine residues by Lck and associates with ZAP-70, a T-cell-specific tyrosine
kinase. The phosphorylation of both conserved tyrosine residues on the ITAM is
required for the recruitment of ZAP-70. Finally, Lck is required for the
activation of NFAT by YE-Nef. These results demonstrate that YE-Nef contains a
functional ITAM and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of SIVpbj14.
