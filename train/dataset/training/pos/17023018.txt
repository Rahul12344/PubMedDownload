The E2 protein of papillomaviruses binds to specific sites in the viral genome to
regulate its transcription, replication and segregation in mitosis. Amino acid
substitutions in the transactivation domain (TAD) of E2, of Arg37 and Ile73, have
been shown previously to impair the transcriptional activity of the protein but
not its ability to support viral DNA replication. To understand the biochemical
basis of this defect, we have used the TADs of a low-risk (HPV11) and a high-risk
(HPV31) human papillomavirus (HPV) as affinity ligands to capture proteins from
whole cell extracts that can associate with these domains. The major TAD-binding 
protein was identified by mass spectrometry and western blotting as the long
isoform of Brd4. Binding to Brd4 was also demonstrated for the E2 TADs of other
papillomaviruses including cutaneous and animal types. For HPV11, HPV31 and CRPV 
E2, we found that binding to Brd4 is significantly reduced by substitutions of
Arg37 and Ile73. Since these amino acids are located near each other in the
3-dimensional structure of the TAD, we suggest that they define a conserved
surface involved in binding Brd4 to regulate viral gene transcription.
