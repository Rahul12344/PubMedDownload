HBV (hepatitis B virus) is a primary cause of chronic liver disease, which
frequently results in hepatitis, cirrhosis and ultimately HCC (hepatocellular
carcinoma). Recently, we showed that HBx (HBV protein X) expression induces lipid
accumulation in hepatic cells mediated by the induction of SREBP1
(sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1), a key regulator of lipogenic genes
in the liver. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HBx increases SREBP1
expression and transactivation remain to be clearly elucidated. In the present
study, we demonstrated that HBx interacts with LXRalpha (liver X receptor alpha) 
and enhances the binding of LXRalpha to LXRE (LXR-response element), thereby
resulting in the up-regulation of SREBP1 and FAS (fatty acid synthase) in the
presence or absence of the LXR agonist T0901317 in the hepatic cells and
HBx-transgenic mice. Furthermore, HBx also augments the ability to recruit ASC2
(activating signal co-integrator 2), a transcriptional co-activator that controls
liver lipid metabolic pathways, to the LXRE with LXRalpha. These studies place
LXRalpha in a key position within the HBx-induced lipogenic pathways, and suggest
a molecular mechanism through which HBV infection can stimulate the
SREBP1-mediated control of hepatic lipid accumulation.
