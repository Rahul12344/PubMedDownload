Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important human pathogen that is remarkably
efficient at establishing persistent infection. The HCV core protein is the first
protein expressed during the early phase of HCV infection. Our previous work
demonstrated that the HCV core protein suppresses host immune responses,
including anti-viral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in a murine model. To
investigate the mechanism of HCV core-mediated immunosuppression, we searched for
host proteins capable of associating with the core protein using a yeast
two-hybrid system. Using the core protein as bait, we screened a human T
cell-enriched expression library and identified a gene encoding the gC1q receptor
(gC1qR). C1q is a ligand of gC1qR and is involved in the early host defense
against infection. Like C1q, HCV core can inhibit T-cell proliferative responses 
in vitro. This core-induced anti-T-cell proliferation is reversed by addition of 
anti-gC1qR Ab in a T-cell proliferation assay. Furthermore, biochemical analysis 
of the interaction between core and gC1qR indicates that HCV core binds the
region spanning amino acids 188 to 259 of gC1qR, a site distinct from the binding
region of C1q. The inhibition of T-cell responsiveness by HCV core may have
important implications for HCV persistence in humans.
