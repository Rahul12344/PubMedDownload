BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus X protein is a key regulator of
hepatocarcinogenesis. The pregnane X receptor is a xenobiotic nuclear receptor
that plays a role in the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes including the
cytochrome P450 3A4, an enzyme important for the bioactivation of the liver
carcinogen aflatoxin B1.
AIMS: To identify novel host factor that interacts with hepatitis B virus X
protein and the functional interaction between hepatitis B virus X protein and
pregnane X receptor in hepatocarcinogenesis.
METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation were utilized to assess the interaction between
hepatitis B virus X protein and pregnane X receptor. The functional relevance of 
hepatitis B virus X protein-pregnane X receptor interaction was investigated in
cell cultures and hepatocellular carcinoma samples.
RESULTS: We observed that hepatitis B virus X protein and pregnane X receptor
co-localize in hepatic cells. Pregnane X receptor interacted with hepatitis B
virus X protein via the ligand-binding domain of pregnane X receptor.
Functionally, hepatitis B virus X protein increased the transcriptional activity 
of pregnane X receptor. Pregnane X receptor was able to recruit hepatitis B virus
X protein to the CYP3A4 gene promoter. In clinic samples, the expression of
pregnane X receptor was high in hepatitis B virus-associated liver cirrhosis and 
stage I hepatocellular carcinoma, but low in state II and stage III
hepatocellular carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: We revealed a novel function of hepatitis B virus X protein in
co-activating pregnane X receptor. The increased expression of pregnane X
receptor and its target gene CYP3A4 are potential biomarkers for the early stage 
of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.
