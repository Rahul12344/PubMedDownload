Nef protein of HIV/SIV lentiviruses affects G-protein-mediated signaling, and
physically associates to Lck, a myristoylated and palmitoylated Src-like tyrosine
kinase. To assess whether Nef interacts with alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G
proteins (Galpha), carrying the same lipidation motif as Lck, we transiently
expressed Nef and G(o)alpha (wild-type or nonpalmitoylated C3S mutant),
individually or in combination, in transfected COS-7 cells. Recombinant Nef was
mostly recovered in particulate fractions, and a Nef-Green Fluorescent Protein
chimera was localized at the plasmalemma by in vivo fluorescence imaging.
Moreover, Nef and C3S were entirely solubilized by cold Triton X-100, and
excluded from low buoyant density sucrose gradient fractions, containing
caveolin-1, whereas wild-type G(o)alpha was partially resistant to Triton
extraction, and colocalized with caveolin-1. After coexpression, Nef recruited
soluble C3S to membranes, and the two proteins were coimmunoprecipitated by
G(o)alpha and Nef antisera. We conclude that Nef interacts with nonpalmitoylated 
G(o)alpha, presumably outside caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane.
