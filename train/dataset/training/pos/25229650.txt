Stress granules (SG) are translationally silent sites of RNA triage induced by
environmental stresses including viral infection. Here we show that HIV-1 Gag
blocks SG assembly irrespective of eIF2α phosphorylation and even when SG
assembly is forced by overexpression of Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein
(G3BP1) or TIAR. The overexposed loops in the amino-terminal capsid domain of Gag
and host eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) are found to be critical for the
SG blockade via interaction. Moreover, cyclophilin A (CypA) stabilizes the
Gag-eEF2 association. eEF2 depletion not only lifts the SG blockade but also
results in impaired virus production and infectivity. Gag also disassembles
preformed SGs by recruiting G3BP1, thereby displacing eEF2, revealing another
unsuspected virus-host interaction involved in the HIV-1-imposed SG blockade.
Understanding how HIV-1 counters anti-viral stress responses will lay the
groundwork for new therapeutic strategies to bolster host cell immune defences
against HIV-1 and other pathogens.
