Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern around the world, and
only a minority of patients receiving current treatments achieve a sustained
response following a short course of therapy. The majority of patients require
prolonged therapy to suppress viral replication. However, several recent reports 
show that inhibiting host-cell proteins can prevent viral infection. Human
epiregulin (EREG) was confirmed by our previous study to be up-regulated in
HepG2.2.15 cells while down-regulated by lamivudine. Therefore, the question was 
asked whether inhibiting EREG could prevent viral infection. To address this
question, antisense oligonucleiotides (ASODNs) were used to down-regulate EREG
expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. We were able to show that HBV propagation in
HepG2.2.15 cell culture was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by EREG
inhibition. In addition, we found that treatment with ASODNs did not affect
HepG2.2.15 cell viability. To probe the role of EREG in HBV replication, the
interaction between EREG and HBsAg was also verified using co-immunoprecipitation
and GST pull-down assays. We observed that EREG can contribute to HBsAg binding
to HepG2 cells. In summary, this study demonstrates that EREG is essential for
HBV replication and also provides some evidence for the potential role of EREG in
HBsAg binding.
