Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) completes its final envelopment on intracellular
membranes before it is released from the cell. The mechanisms underlying these
processes are not understood. Here we studied the role of Rab27a, a regulator of 
lysosome-related organelle transport, in HCMV production. HCMV infection
increased Rab27a expression, and recruitment of Rab27a to membranous strutures at
the assembly site. Immuno-gold labelling demonstrated association of Rab27a with 
viral envelopes. CMV production was reduced after knock-down of Rab27a, and in
Rab27a-deficient ashen melanocytes. This study shows a requirement for Rab27a in 
the CMV life cycle and suggests that CMV and LRO biogenesis share common
molecular mechanisms.
