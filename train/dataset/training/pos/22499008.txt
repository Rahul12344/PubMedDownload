Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X protein (HBx protein) is a multi-functional
regulatory protein. It functions by protein-protein interaction and plays a
pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related diseases. However, the partners
in hepatocytes interacting with HBx protein are far from understood fully. In
this study, immunoprecipitation was employed to screen for binding partners for
the HBx protein from huh-7 hepatoma cells infected with recombinant adenovirus
expressing HBx protein, and five cellular proteins including eukaryotic
translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), were identified. The
interaction between HBx protein and eEF1A1 was confirmed further using a GST
pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. In Huh-7 hepatoma
cells, the HBx protein inhibits dimer formation of eEF1A1, hence blocks
filamentous actin bundling. These findings provide new insights into the
molecular mechanisms involved in the functions of the HBx protein.
