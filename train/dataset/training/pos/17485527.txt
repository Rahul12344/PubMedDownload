Glycoprotein I (gI) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) contains a tandem
repeat (TR) region including the amino acids serine and threonine, residues that 
can be utilized for O-glycosylation. The length of this TR region was determined 
for 82 clinical HSV-1 isolates and the results revealed a polymorphic
distribution of two to six or eight repeated blocks with a majority harbouring
between two and four repeats. Assessment of the O-glycosylation capacity of an
acceptor peptide (STPSTTTSTPSTTT), representing two of the gI blocks, showed that
the peptide was a universal substrate for O-glycosylation not only for the two
most commonly expressed N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc)-T1 and -T2
transferases, but also for the GalNAc-T3, -T4 and -T11 transferases.
Immunoblotting of virus-infected cells showed that gI was exclusively
O-glycosylated with GalNAc monosaccharides (Tn antigen). A polymorphic mucin
region has not been described previously for HSV-1 and is a unique finding, as
repeated blocks within gI homologues are lacking in other alphaherpesviruses.
