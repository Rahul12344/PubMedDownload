The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) potent transactivator Tat protein
mediates pleiotropic effects on various cell functions. Posttranslational
modification of Tat affects its activity during viral transcription. Tat binds to
TAR and subsequently becomes acetylated on lysine residues by histone
acetyltransferases. Novel protein-protein interaction domains on acetylated Tat
are then established, which are necessary for both sustained transcriptional
activation of the HIV-1 promoter and viral transcription elongation. In this
study, we investigated the identity of proteins that preferentially bound
acetylated Tat. Using a proteomic approach, we identified a number of proteins
that preferentially bound AcTat, among which p32, a cofactor of splicing factor
ASF/SF-2, was identified. We found that p32 was recruited to the HIV-1 genome,
suggesting a mechanism by which acetylation of Tat may inhibit HIV-1 splicing
needed for the production of full-length transcripts. Using Tat from different
clades, harboring a different number of acetylation sites, as well as Tat mutated
at lysine residues, we demonstrated that Tat acetylation affected splicing in
vivo. Finally, using confocal microscopy, we found that p32 and Tat colocalize in
vivo in HIV-1-infected cells.
