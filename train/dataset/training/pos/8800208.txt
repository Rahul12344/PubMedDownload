Since the first report documenting that HIV-1 Vpr was involved in the stimulation
of transactivation of several unrelated promoters, little additional information 
has been reported. By using transient transfection experiments, we confirmed and 
extended these previously reported data. Further in vivo experiments showed that 
Vpr can co-operatively stimulate transactivation activity of a minimal promoter
containing one GAL4 DNA-binding site, when it is co-expressed with different
heterologous activator domains fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Thus, Vpr could 
transactivate in concert with an activator domain, but has no effect on the
transactivation of a minimal promoter in the absence of activator protein. To
investigate whether Vpr can interact with components of the basal transcriptional
machinery, in vitro protein-protein binding assays were performed using either
translated, radiolabeled Vpr or TFIIB proteins and glutathione S-transferase Vpr 
or TFIIB chimeric proteins. We demonstrated that the portion of Vpr ranging from 
amino acids 15 to 77 interacts specifically with the basal transcription factor
TFIIB. Also, our data indicated that the N-terminal domain of TFIIB is required
for the interaction.
