The predicted extracellular domain of the CD2v protein of African swine fever
virus (ASFV) shares significant similarity to that of the CD2 protein in T cells 
but has a unique cytoplasmic domain of unknown function. Here we have shown that 
CD2v is expressed as a glycoprotein of approximately 105 kDa in ASFV-infected
cells. In the absence of an extracellular ligand, the majority of CD2v appears to
localize to perinuclear membrane compartments. Furthermore, we have shown using
the yeast two-hybrid system and by direct binding studies that the cytoplasmic
tail of CD2v binds to the cytoplasmic adaptor protein SH3P7 (mAbp1, HIP55), which
has been reported to be involved in diverse cellular functions such as vesicle
transport and signal transduction. A cDNA clone encoding a variant form of SH3P7 
could also be identified and was found to be expressed in a wide range of porcine
tissues. Deletion mutagenesis identified proline-rich repeats of sequence PPPKPC 
in the ASFV CD2v protein to be necessary and sufficient for binding to the SH3
domain of SH3P7. In ASFV-infected cells, CD2v and SH3P7 co-localized in areas
surrounding the perinuclear virus factories. These areas also stained with an
antibody that recognizes a Golgi network protein, indicating that they contained 
membranes derived from the Golgi network. Our data provide a first molecular
basis for the understanding of the immunomodulatory functions of CD2v in
ASFV-infected animals.
