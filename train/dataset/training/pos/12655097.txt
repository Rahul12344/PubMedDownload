The BZLF1 open reading frame of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes an important
transactivator of replication. During latency, transcription of this gene is
switched off. HI motifs have been shown to cause negative regulation of the
promoter. Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we isolated the E box-binding protein,
E2-2, interacting with these motifs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
demonstrated that E2-2 binds to HI alpha, HI beta and HI gamma, which contain E
box consensus binding sites. Deletion of the HI-associated E boxes and
overexpression of E2-2 in transfection assays revealed that these elements act as
repressors in lymphoid cells. In contrast, in epithelial cells they contribute to
the increased responsiveness of the promoter to transactivation by the BZLF1
protein. The data presented are in accord with an alternative and exclusive
binding of different cell type- and differentiation-specific factors, such as
E2-2, to the HI-associated E boxes in lymphoid and epithelial cells. This implies
a role in cell type-specific virus replication.
