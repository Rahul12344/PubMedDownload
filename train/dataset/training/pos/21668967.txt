BACKGROUND: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is able to bind with many
proteins that affect cellular signal transduction and protein synthesis in
infected cells. The NS1 protein consists of approximately 230 amino acids and the
last 4 amino acids of the NS1 C-terminal form a PDZ binding motif. Postsynaptic
Density Protein-95 (PSD-95), which is mainly expressed in neurons, has 3 PDZ
domains. We hypothesise that NS1 binds to PSD-95, and this binding is able to
affect neuronal function.
RESULT: We conducted a yeast two-hybrid analysis, GST-pull down assays and
co-immunoprecipitations to detect the interaction between NS1 and PSD-95. The
results showed that NS1 of avian influenza virus H5N1
(A/chicken/Guangdong/1/2005) is able to bind to PSD-95, whereas NS1 of human
influenza virus H1N1 (A/Shantou/169/2006) is unable to do so. The results also
revealed that NS1 of H5N1 significantly reduces the production of nitric oxide
(NO) in rat hippocampal neurons.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our study indicates that NS1 of influenza A virus can
bind with neuronal PSD-95, and the avian H5N1 and human H1N1 influenza A viruses 
possess distinct binding properties.
