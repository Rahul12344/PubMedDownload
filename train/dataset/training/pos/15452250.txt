Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a T-cell cDNA library to identify cellular
proteins that bind to the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) Gag
polyprotein, we identified PRP4, a serine-threonine protein kinase. Specific
interaction of PRP4 and HIV-2 Gag was confirmed in in vitro and in vivo assays.
The interacting region of HIV-2 Gag is located in the conserved matrix and capsid
domains, while both the RS (arginine-serine-rich) domain and the KS (kinase)
domain of PRP4 are able to bind to HIV-2 Gag. PRP4 is not incorporated into virus
particles. HIV-2 Gag is able to inhibit PRP4-mediated phosphorylation of the
splicing factor SF2. This is also observed with Gag from simian immunodeficiency 
virus, a closely related virus, but not with Gag from human T-cell lymphotropic
virus type 1. Our results provide evidence for a novel interaction between Gag
and a cellular protein kinase involved in the control of constitutive splicing in
two closely related retroviruses. We hypothesize that as Gag accumulates in the
cell, down regulation of splicing occurs through reduced phosphorylation of SF2. 
At late stages of infection, this interaction may replace the function of the
early viral regulatory protein Rev.
