The assembly of a preinitiation complex containing RNA polymerase II on promoter 
DNA is a complex process that involves several general transcription factors.
Using 5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl] photocross-linking, we previously
determined the locations of the two large subunits of transcription factor (TF)
IIA (A35 and A21), TATA box-binding protein (TBP), RNA polymerase II-associated
protein (RAP) 30, and TFIIB along the Ad2 ML promoter. We have now localized
TFIIE34 and RAP74 just upstream of the transcription start site. The two subunits
of TFIIF, RAP74 and RAP30, cross-linked to nucleotides that probed adjacent
spaces on the same face of the DNA helix beginning just downstream of TBP at -19 
and extending to -5. Specific photocross-linking of TFIIE34 required the presence
TFIIE56. In addition, TFIIE and RAP74 strongly stimulated cross-linking of RAP30 
and the large subunits of RNA polymerase II to position -19. Our topological data
support the idea that RAP74 and TFIIE34 may be involved in melting of the
promoter DNA upstream of the initiation site.
