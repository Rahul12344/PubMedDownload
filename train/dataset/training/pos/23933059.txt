Circoviruses represent a rapidly increasing genus of viruses that infect a
variety of vertebrates. Replication requires shuttling viral molecules into the
host cell nucleus, a process facilitated by capsid-associated protein (Cap).
Whilst a nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been shown to mediate nuclear
translocation, the mode of nuclear transport remains to be elucidated. To better 
understand this process, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) Cap NLS was
crystallized with nuclear import receptor importin-α (Impα). Diffraction yielded 
structural data to 2.9Å resolution, and the binding site on both Impα and BFDV
Cap NLS were well resolved. The binding mechanism for the major site is likely
conserved across circoviruses as supported by the similarity of NLSs in
circovirus Caps. This finding illuminates a crucial step for infection of host
cells by this viral family, and provides a platform for rational drug design
against the binding interface.
