The expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) causes the
cellular "antiviral state" in which the replication of many viruses, including
HIV-1, is attenuated. We conducted a screen for ISGs that inhibit HIV-1 virion
production and found that 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP), a
membrane-associated protein with unknown function in mammals has this property.
CNP binds to the structural protein Gag and blocks HIV-1 particle assembly after 
Gag and viral RNA have associated with the plasma membrane. Several primate
lentiviruses are CNP-sensitive, and CNP sensitivity/resistance is determined by a
single, naturally dimorphic, codon (E/K40) in the matrix domain of Gag. Like
other antiretroviral proteins, CNP displays interspecies variation in antiviral
activity. Mice encode an inactive CNP variant and a single amino acid difference 
in murine versus human CNP determines Gag binding and antiviral activity. Some
cell types express high levels of CNP and we speculate that CNP evolved to
restrict lentivirus replication therein.
