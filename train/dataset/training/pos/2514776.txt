Purified HIV-1 antigen preparations produced in cell culture were found to
contain interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Electron microscopic examination of HIV-1
released by H9 cells, a cell line found to produce IFN-gamma, showed the presence
of this molecule on the surface of the virus particle. The HIV-1 protein p17 was 
found to bind IFN-gamma by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. The specificity of the
reaction was confirmed by Western blot analysis. This finding opens new questions
about the biologic role of IFN-gamma itself and of its interaction with HIV.
