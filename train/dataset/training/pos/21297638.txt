MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that function by
regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Alterations in miRNA
expression can strongly influence cellular physiology. Here we demonstrated
cross-regulation between two components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery 
in human cells. Inhibition of exportin-5, the karyopherin responsible for
pre-miRNA export, downregulated expression of Dicer, the RNase III required for
pre-miRNA maturation. This effect was post-transcriptional and resulted from an
increased nuclear localization of Dicer mRNA. In vitro assays and cellular RNA
immunoprecipitation experiments showed that exportin-5 interacted directly with
Dicer mRNA. Titration of exportin-5 by overexpression of either pre-miRNA or the 
adenoviral VA1 RNA resulted in loss of Dicer mRNA-exportin-5 interaction and
reduction of Dicer level. This saturation also occurred during adenoviral
infection and enhanced viral replication. Our study reveals an important
cross-regulatory mechanism between pre-miRNA or viral small RNAs and Dicer
through exportin-5.
