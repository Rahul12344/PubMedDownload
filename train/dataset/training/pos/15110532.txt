Most viruses exploit a variety of host cellular proteins as primary cellular
attachment receptors in the context of successful execution of infection.
Furthermore, many viral agents have evolved precise mechanisms to subvert host
immune recognition to achieve persistence. Herein we present data indicating that
adenovirus (Ad) serotype 3 utilizes CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2) as cellular
attachment receptors. CD80 and CD86 are co-stimulatory molecules that are present
on mature dendritic cells and B lymphocytes and are involved in stimulating
T-lymphocyte activation. To our knowledge, this is one of the first
demonstrations of a virus utilizing immunologic accessory molecules as a primary 
means of cellular entry. This finding suggests a mechanism whereby viral
exploitation of these proteins as receptors may achieve both goals of cellular
entry and evading the immune system.
