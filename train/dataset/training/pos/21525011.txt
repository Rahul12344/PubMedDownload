Reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus from latency is dependent on expression of
the BZLF1 viral immediate-early protein. The BZLF1 promoter (Zp) normally
exhibits only low basal activity but is activated in response to chemical
inducers such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and calcium ionophore. We
found that Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) plays a significant role in
suppressing Zp activity. Reporter, EMSA, and ChIP assays of a Zp mutant virus
revealed JDP2 association with Zp at the ZII cis-element, a binding site for
CREB/ATF/AP-1. Suppression of Zp activity by JDP2 correlated with HDAC3
association and reduced levels of histone acetylation. Although introduction of
point mutations into the ZII element of the viral genome did not increase the
level of BZLF1 production, silencing of endogenous JDP2 gene expression by RNA
interference increased the levels of viral early gene products and viral DNA
replication. These results indicate that JDP2 plays a role as a repressor of Zp
and that its replacement by CREB/ATF/AP-1 at ZII is crucial to triggering
reactivation from latency to lytic replication.
