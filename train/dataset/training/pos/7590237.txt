A novel cellular protein, Abl-interactor-1 (Abi-1), which specifically interacts 
with the carboxy-terminal region of Abl oncoproteins, has been identified in a
mouse leukemia cell line. The protein exhibits sequence similarity to homeotic
genes, contains several polyproline stretches, and includes a src homology 3
(SH3) domain at its very carboxyl terminus that is required for binding to Abl
proteins. The abi-1 gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome 2 and is genetically
closely linked to the c-abl locus. The gene is widely expressed in the mouse,
with highest levels of mRNA found in the bone marrow, spleen, brain, and testes. 
The Abi-1 protein coimmunoprecipitates with v-Abl and serves as a substrate for
kinase activity. When overexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells, abi-1 potently suppresses
the transforming activity of Abelson leukemia virus expressing the full-length
p160v-abl kinase but does not affect the transforming activity of viruses
expressing a truncated p90v-abl or v-src kinases. We suggest that the Abi-1
protein may serve as a regulator of Abl function in transformation or in signal
transduction.
