RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) subunit 5 (RPB5) is positioned close to DNA downstream
of the initiation site and is the site of interaction with several regulators.
Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) binds the central part of RPB5 to modulate
activated transcription, and TFIIF subunit RAP30 interacts with the same part of 
RPB5 that is critical for the association between TFIIF and RNAPII. However the
residues necessary for these interactions remain unknown. Here we report
systematic mutagenesis of the central part of RPB5 using two-step alanine
scanning libraries to pinpoint critical residues for its binding to RAP30 in the 
TFIIF complex and/or to HBx, and identified these residues in both mammalian
cells and in an in vitro binding assay. Four residues, F76, I104, T111 and S113, 
are critical for both TFIIF- and HBx-binding, indicating the overlapping nature
of the sites of interaction. In addition, V74 and N98 are required for
HBx-binding, and T56 and L58 are needed for RAP30-binding. Interestingly the
residues exposed to solvent, T111 and S113, are very close to the DNA, implying
that two factors may modulate the interaction between DNA and RPB5.
