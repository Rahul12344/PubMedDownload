Paramyxovirus matrix (M) proteins organize virus assembly, functioning as
adapters that link together viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and viral
glycoproteins at infected cell plasma membranes. M proteins may also function to 
recruit and manipulate host factors to assist virus budding, similar to
retroviral Gag proteins. By yeast two-hybrid screening, angiomotin-like 1
(AmotL1) was identified as a host factor that interacts with the M protein of
parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). AmotL1-M protein interaction was observed in yeast,
in transfected mammalian cells, and in virus-infected cells. Binding was mapped
to a 83-amino acid region derived from the C-terminal portion of AmotL1.
Overexpression of M-binding AmotL1-derived polypeptides potently inhibited
production of PIV5 VLPs and impaired virus budding. Expression of these
polypeptides moderately inhibited production of mumps VLPs, but had no effect on 
production of Nipah VLPs. siRNA-mediated depletion of AmotL1 protein reduced PIV5
budding, suggesting that this interaction is beneficial to paramyxovirus
infection.
