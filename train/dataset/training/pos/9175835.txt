Tip of herpesvirus saimiri associates with Lck and down-regulates Lck-mediated
activation. We identified a novel cellular Tip-associated protein (Tap) by a
yeast two-hybrid screen. Tap associated with Tip following transient expression
in COS-1 cells and stable expression in human Jurkat-T cells. Expression of Tip
and Tap in Jurkat-T cells induced dramatic cell aggregation. Aggregation was
likely caused by the up-regulated surface expression of adhesion molecules
including integrin alpha, L-selectin, ICAM-3, and H-CAM. Furthermore, NF-kappaB
transcriptional factor of aggregated cells had approximately 40-fold higher
activity than that of parental cells. Thus, Tap is likely to be an important
cellular mediator of Tip function in T cell transformation by herpesvirus
saimiri.
