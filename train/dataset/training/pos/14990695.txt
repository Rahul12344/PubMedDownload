Simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) is a viral oncoprotein that can promote
cellular transformation. TAg's transforming activity results in part by binding
and inactivating key tumor suppressors, including p53 and the retinoblastoma
protein (pRb). We have identified a TAg-associated 185-kDa protein that has
significant homology to the cullin family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. TAg binds to
an SCF-like complex that contains p185/Cul7, Rbx1, and the F box protein Fbw6.
This SCF-like complex binds to an N-terminal region of TAg. Several
p185/Cul7-binding-deficient mutants of TAg were generated that retained binding
to pRb and p53 and were capable of overcoming Rb-mediated repression of E2F
transcription. Despite binding to pRb and p53, these p185/Cul7-binding-defective 
mutants of TAg were unable to transform primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. Cells
expressing p185/Cul7-binding-defective mutants of TAg were unable to grow to high
density or grow in an anchorage-independent manner as determined by growth in
soft agar. Considering the significance of other TAg-interacting proteins in
regulation of the cell cycle, p185/Cul7 may also regulate an important growth
control pathway.
