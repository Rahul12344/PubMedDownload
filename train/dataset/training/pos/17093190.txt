We identified the transcriptional coactivator FHL2 as a novel target of the human
papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 oncoprotein, which plays a major role in cell 
transformation. The interaction with FHL2 is abolished by mutations in conserved 
regions 1 and 2 and in the C-terminal zinc finger domain of E7, all required for 
its transforming potential. We found that E7 impairs the coactivator function of 
FHL2 on both beta-catenin/LCF-dependent and AP-1-dependent promoters. Thus, the
interaction with HPV-16 E7 leads to a promoter-specific impairment of FHL2
function and this may contribute to cell transformation.
