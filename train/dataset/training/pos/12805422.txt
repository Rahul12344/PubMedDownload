The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for
the nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced and partially spliced HIV mRNAs
containing the Rev response element (RRE). In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa
cell-derived cDNA expression library for human factors interacting with the Rev
leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES), we identified a kinesin-like protein,
REBP (Rev/Rex effector binding protein), highly homologous to Kid, the
carboxy-terminal 75-residue region of which interacts specifically with the NESs 
of HIV-1 Rev, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex, and equine infectious
anemia virus Rev but not with functionally inactive mutants thereof. REBP is a
nuclear protein that colocalizes with Rev in the nucleoplasm and nuclear
periphery of transfected cells. Specific, albeit weak, interaction between REBP
and Rev could be demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation assays in BSC-40 cells.
REBP can modestly enhance Rev-dependent RRE-linked reporter gene expression both 
independently and in cooperation with the nucleoporin cofactor Rab/hRIP. Thus,
REBP displays the characteristics expected of an authentic mediator of Rev NES
function and may play a role in RRE RNA transport during HIV infection.
