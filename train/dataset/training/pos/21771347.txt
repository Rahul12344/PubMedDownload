Post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression is mediated by
interactions between viral transcripts and viral/cellular proteins. For HIV-1,
post-transcriptional nuclear control allows for the export of intron-containing
RNAs which are normally retained in the nucleus. Specific signals on the viral
RNAs, such as instability sequences (INS) and Rev responsive element (RRE), are
binding sites for viral and cellular factors that serve to regulate RNA-export.
The HIV-1 encoded viral Rev protein binds to the RRE found on unspliced and
incompletely spliced viral RNAs. Binding by Rev directs the export of these RNAs 
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Previously, Rev co-factors have been found to 
include cellular factors such as CRM1, DDX3, PIMT and others. In this work, the
nuclear matrix protein Matrin 3 is shown to bind Rev/RRE-containing viral RNA.
This binding interaction stabilizes unspliced and partially spliced HIV-1
transcripts leading to increased cytoplasmic expression of these viral RNAs.
