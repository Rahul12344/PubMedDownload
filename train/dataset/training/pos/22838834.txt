Rift Valley Fever is an infectious viral disease and an emerging problem in many 
countries of Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula. The causative virus is
predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes and high mortality and abortion rates
characterize outbreaks in animals while symptoms ranging from mild to
life-threatening encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever are noticed among infected
humans. For a better prevention and treatment of the infection, an increased
knowledge of the infectious process of the virus is required. The focus of this
work was to identify protein-protein interactions between the non-structural
protein (NSm), encoded by the M-segment of the virus, and host cell proteins.
This study was initiated by screening approximately 26 million cDNA clones of a
mouse embryonic cDNA library for interactions with the NSm protein using a yeast 
two-hybrid system. We have identified nine murine proteins that interact with NSm
protein of Rift Valley Fever virus, and the putative protein-protein interactions
were confirmed by growth selection procedures and β-gal activity measurements.
Our results suggest that the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor
subunit 2 (Cpsf2), the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (cyclophilin)-like 2
protein (Ppil2), and the synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) are
the most promising targets for the NSm protein of the virus during an infection.
