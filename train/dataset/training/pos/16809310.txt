Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein activates viral
transcription from the long terminal repeats (LTR). Mechanisms through which Tax 
activates LTR have been established, but coactivators of this process remain to
be identified and characterized. Here we show that all three members of the TORC 
family of transcriptional regulators are coactivators of Tax for LTR-driven
expression. TORC coactivation requires CREB, but not ATF4 or other bZIP factors. 
Tax physically interacts with TORC1, TORC2, and TORC3 (TORC1/2/3), and the
depletion of TORC1/2/3 inhibited Tax activity. TORC coactivation can be further
enhanced by transcriptional coactivator p300. In addition, coactivators in the
p300 family are required for full activity of Tax independently of TORC1/2/3.
Thus, both TORC and p300 families of coactivators are essential for optimal
activation of HTLV-1 transcription by Tax.
