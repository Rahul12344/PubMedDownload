Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary risk factor for the
development of cervical cancer. The papillomavirus E6 gene is essential for
virus-induced cellular transformation and the viral life cycle. Important insight
into the mechanism of E6 function came from the discovery that cancer-related HPV
E6 proteins promote the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53. However,
mounting evidence indicates that interaction with p53 does not mediate all E6
activities. To explore the p53-independent functions of E6, we performed a yeast 
two-hybrid screen and identified fibulin-1 as an E6 binding protein. Fibulin-1 is
a calcium-binding plasma and extracellular matrix protein that has been
implicated in cellular transformation and tumor invasion. The interaction between
E6 and fibulin-1 was demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Fibulin-1 
is associated specifically with cancer-related HPV E6s and the transforming
bovine papillomavirus type 1 E6. Significantly, overexpression of fibulin-1
specifically inhibited E6-mediated transformation. These results suggest that
fibulin-1 plays an important role in the biological activities of E6.
