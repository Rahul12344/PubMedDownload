Cervical cancers transformed by high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) express the
E7 oncoprotein, which accelerates the degradation of the retinoblastoma protein
(Rb). Here we show that the E7-mediated degradation of Rb requires the
calcium-activated cysteine protease, calpain. E7 bound and activated mu-calpain
and promoted cleavage at Rb(810), with mutation of this residue preventing
E7-mediated degradation. The calpain cleavage product, Rb(1-810), was unable to
mediate cell cycle arrest but retained the ability to repress E6/E7
transcription. E7 also promoted the accelerated proteasomal degradation of
Rb(1-810). Calpain inhibitors reduced the viability of HPV-transformed cells and 
synergized with cisplatin. Calpain, thus, emerges as a central player in
E7-mediated degradation of Rb and represents a potential new drug target for the 
treatment of HPV-associated lesions.
