We previously showed that reduced infectivity of HIV with incompletely processed 
capsid-spacer protein 1 (CA-SP1) is rescued by cellular activation or increased
expression of HSP90AB1, a member of the cytosolic heat shock protein 90 family.
Here we show that HSP90AB1 is present in HIV virions and that HSP90AB1, but not
nonfunctional mutated HSP90AB1(E42A+D88A), restores infectivity to HIV with
mutations in CA that alter core stability. Further, the CA mutants were
hypersensitive to pharmacological inhibition of HSP90AB1. In agreement with
Roesch et al. (2012), we found that culturing HIV at 39.5°C enhanced viral
infectivity up to 30-fold in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p=0.002)
and rescued CA-mutant infectivity in nonactivated cells, concurrent with elevated
expression of HSP90AB1 during hyperthermia. In sum, the transdominant effect of
HSP90AB1 on CA-mutant HIV infectivity suggests a potential role for this class of
cellular chaperones in HIV core stability and uncoating.
