Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) exhibits a remarkably robust and pantropic
infectivity, mediated by its coat protein, VSV-G. Using this property,
recombinant forms of VSV and VSV-G-pseudotyped viral vectors are being developed 
for gene therapy, vaccination, and viral oncolysis and are extensively used for
gene transduction in vivo and in vitro. The broad tropism of VSV suggests that it
enters cells through a highly ubiquitous receptor, whose identity has so far
remained elusive. Here we show that the LDL receptor (LDLR) serves as the major
entry port of VSV and of VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in human and mouse 
cells, whereas other LDLR family members serve as alternative receptors. The
widespread expression of LDLR family members accounts for the pantropism of VSV
and for the broad applicability of VSV-G-pseudotyped viral vectors for gene
transduction.
