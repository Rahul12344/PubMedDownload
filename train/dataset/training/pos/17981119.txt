Cell entry of Simian Virus 40 (SV40) involves caveolar/lipid raft-mediated
endocytosis, vesicular transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), translocation
into the cytosol, and import into the nucleus. We analyzed the effects of
ER-associated processes and factors on infection and on isolated viruses and
found that SV40 makes use of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, ERp57 and PDI, 
as well as the retrotranslocation proteins Derlin-1 and Sel1L. ERp57 isomerizes
specific interchain disulfides connecting the major capsid protein, VP1, to a
crosslinked network of neighbors, thus uncoupling about 12 of 72 VP1 pentamers.
Cryo-electron tomography indicated that loss of interchain disulfides coupled
with calcium depletion induces selective dissociation of the 12 vertex pentamers,
a step likely to mimic uncoating of the virus in the cytosol. Thus, the virus
utilizes the protein folding machinery for initial uncoating before exploiting
the ER-associated degradation machinery presumably to escape from the ER lumen
into the cytosol.
