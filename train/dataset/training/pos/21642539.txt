The complement system plays a pivotal protective role in the innate immune
response to many pathogens including flaviviruses. Flavivirus nonstructural
protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in
plasma to high levels and is displayed on the surface of infected cells but
absent from viral particles. Previous work has defined an immune evasion role of 
flavivirus NS1 in limiting complement activation by forming a complex with C1s
and C4 to promote cleavage of C4 to C4b. In this study, we demonstrate a second
mechanism, also involving C4 and its active fragment C4b, by which NS1
antagonizes complement activation. Dengue, West Nile, or yellow fever virus NS1
directly associated with C4b binding protein (C4BP), a complement regulatory
plasma protein that attenuates the classical and lectin pathways. Soluble NS1
recruited C4BP to inactivate C4b in solution and on the plasma membrane. Mapping 
studies revealed that the interaction sites of NS1 on C4BP partially overlap with
the C4b binding sites. Together, these studies further define the immune evasion 
potential of NS1 in reducing the functional capacity of C4 in complement
activation and control of flavivirus infection.
