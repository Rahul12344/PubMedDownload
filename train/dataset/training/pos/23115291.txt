The NKG2D receptor is expressed on the surface of NK, T, and macrophage lineage
cells and plays an important role in antiviral and antitumor immunity. To evade
NKG2D recognition, herpesviruses block the expression of NKG2D ligands on the
surface of infected cells using a diverse repertoire of sabotage methods. Cowpox 
and monkeypox viruses have taken an alternate approach by encoding a soluble
NKG2D ligand, the orthopoxvirus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
I-like protein (OMCP), which can block NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. This approach
has the advantage of targeting a single conserved receptor instead of numerous
host ligands that exhibit significant sequence diversity. Here, we show that OMCP
binds the NKG2D homodimer as a monomer and competitively blocks host ligand
engagement. We have also determined the 2.25-Ã…-resolution crystal structure of
OMCP from the cowpox virus Brighton Red strain, revealing a truncated MHC class
I-like platform domain consisting of a beta sheet flanked with two antiparallel
alpha helices. OMCP is generally similar in structure to known host NKG2D ligands
but has notable variations in regions typically used to engage NKG2D.
Additionally, the determinants responsible for the 14-fold-higher affinity of
OMCP for human than for murine NKG2D were mapped to a single loop in the NKG2D
ligand-binding pocket.
