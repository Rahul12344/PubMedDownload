Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and
RIG-like helicase (RLH) receptors, are involved in innate immune antiviral
responses. Here we show that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (Nod2)
can also function as a cytoplasmic viral PRR by triggering activation of
interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and production of interferon-beta
(IFN-beta). After recognition of a viral ssRNA genome, Nod2 used the adaptor
protein MAVS to activate IRF3. Nod2-deficient mice failed to produce interferon
efficiently and showed enhanced susceptibility to virus-induced pathogenesis.
Thus, the function of Nod2 as a viral PRR highlights the important function of
Nod2 in host antiviral defense mechanisms.
