Previously, we reported that the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)
induces HIV-1 envelope (Env) degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, but the mechanism was not
clear. Here we investigated how the four ER-associated glycoside hydrolase family
47 (GH47) α-mannosidases, ERManI, and ER-degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like
(EDEM) proteins 1, 2, and 3, are involved in the Env degradation process. Ectopic
expression of these four α-mannosidases uncovers that only ERManI inhibits HIV-1 
Env expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, genetic knock-out of the 
ERManI gene MAN1B1 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology disrupts the TSPO-mediated Env
degradation. Biochemical studies show that HIV-1 Env interacts with ERManI, and
between the ERManI cytoplasmic, transmembrane, lumenal stem, and lumenal
catalytic domains, the catalytic domain plays a critical role in the Env-ERManI
interaction. In addition, functional studies show that inactivation of the
catalytic sites by site-directed mutagenesis disrupts the ERManI activity. These 
studies identify ERManI as a critical GH47 α-mannosidase in the ER-associated
protein degradation pathway that initiates the Env degradation and suggests that 
its catalytic domain and enzymatic activity play an important role in this
process.
