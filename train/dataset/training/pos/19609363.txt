Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is a major survival pathway engaged by the Human
T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein. Tax1 activation of NF-kappaB
occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm, where Tax1 binds NF-kappaB Essential
Modulator (NEMO/IKKgamma) and triggers the activation of IkappaB kinases. Several
independent studies have shown that Tax1-mediated NF-kappaB activation is
dependent on Tax1 ubiquitination. Here, we identify by co-immunoprecipitation
assays NEMO-Related Protein (NRP/Optineurin) as a binding partner for Tax1 in
HTLV-1 infected and Tax1/NRP co-expressing cells. Immunofluorescence studies
reveal that Tax1, NRP and NEMO colocalize in Golgi-associated structures. The
interaction between Tax1 and NRP requires the ubiquitin-binding activity of NRP
and the ubiquitination sites of Tax1. In addition, we observe that NRP increases 
the ubiquitination of Tax1 along with Tax1-dependent NF-kappaB signaling.
Surprisingly, we find that in addition to Tax1, NRP interacts cooperatively with 
the Tax1 binding protein TAX1BP1, and that NRP and TAX1BP1 cooperate to modulate 
Tax1 ubiquitination and NF-kappaB activation. Our data strongly suggest for the
first time that NRP is a critical adaptor that regulates the assembly of TAX1BP1 
and post-translationally modified forms of Tax1, leading to sustained NF-kappaB
activation.
