The origin recognition complex (ORC) has an important function in determining the
initiation sites of DNA replication. In higher eukaryotes, ORC lacks
sequence-specific DNA binding, and the mechanisms of ORC recruitment and origin
determination are poorly understood. ORC is recruited with high efficiency to the
Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication (OriP) through a complex
mechanism involving interactions with the virus-encoded EBNA1 protein. We present
evidence that ORC recruitment to OriP and DNA replication function depends on
RGG-like motifs, referred to as LR1 and LR2, in the EBNA1 amino-terminal domain. 
Moreover, we show that LR1 and LR2 recruitment of ORC is RNA dependent. HMGA1a,
which can functionally substitute for LR1 and LR2 domain, can also recruit ORC in
an RNA-dependent manner. EBNA1 and HMGA1a RGG motifs bound to structured G-rich
RNA, as did ORC1 peptides, which interact with EBNA1. RNase A treatment of
cellular chromatin released a fraction of the total ORC, suggesting that ORC
association with chromatin, and possibly cellular origins, is stabilized by RNA. 
We propose that structural RNA molecules mediate ORC recruitment at some cellular
and viral origins, similar to OriP.
