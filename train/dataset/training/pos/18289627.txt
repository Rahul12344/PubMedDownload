The requirement of the DEAD-box protein DDX24 for the packaging of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA.

RNA helicases play important roles in RNA metabolism. Human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not carry its own RNA helicase, the virus thus needs to
exploit cellular RNA helicases to promote the replication of its RNA at various
steps such as transcription, folding and transport. In this study, we report that
knockdown of a DEAD-box protein named DDX24 inhibits the packaging of HIV-1 RNA
and thus diminishes viral infectivity. The decreased viral RNA packaging as a
result of DDX24-knockdown is observed only in the context of the Rev/RRE (Rev
response element)-dependent but not the CTE (constitutive transport
element)-mediated nuclear export of viral RNA, which is explained by the specific
interaction of DDX24 with the Rev protein. We propose that DDX24 acts at the
early phase of HIV-1 RNA metabolism prior to nuclear export and the consequence
of this action extends to the viral RNA packaging stage during virus assembly.
