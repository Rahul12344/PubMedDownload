Emerging evidence suggests that supernumerary centrosomes drive genome
instability and oncogenesis. Human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is
etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). ATL cells are
aneuploid, but the causes of aneuploidy are incompletely understood. Here, we
show that centrosome amplification is frequent in HTLV-I-transformed cells and
that this phenotype is caused by the viral Tax oncoprotein. We also show that the
fraction of Tax protein that localizes to centrosomes interacts with TAX1BP2, a
novel centrosomal protein composed almost entirely of coiled-coil domains.
Overexpression of TAX1BP2 inhibited centrosome duplication, whereas depletion of 
TAX1BP2 by RNAi resulted in centrosome hyperamplification. Our findings suggest
that the HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein targets TAX1BP2 causing genomic instability and
aneuploidy.
