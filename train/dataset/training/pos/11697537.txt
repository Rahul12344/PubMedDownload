Lactoferrin (Lf), a natural defence iron-binding protein, has been found to
possess antibacterial, antimycotic, antiviral, antineoplastic and
anti-inflammatory activity. The protein is present in exocrine secretions that
are commonly exposed to normal flora: milk, tears, nasal exudate, saliva,
bronchial mucus, gastrointestinal fluids, cervico-vaginal mucus and seminal
fluid. Additionally, Lf is a major constituent of the secondary specific granules
of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The apoprotein is released
on degranulation of the PMNs in septic areas. A principal function of Lf is that 
of scavenging free iron in fluids and inflamed areas so as to suppress free
radical-mediated damage and decrease the availability of the metal to invading
microbial and neoplastic cells. Mechanisms of action of Lf in addition to iron
deprivation are also described. Administration of exogenous human or bovine Lf to
hosts with various infected or inflamed sites has resulted in some prophylactic
or therapeutic effects. However, an adverse response to the protein might occur
if it were to stimulate antibody production or if it were to provide iron to the 
invading pathogen. The recombinant form of human Lf has become available and
development of the product for use in a wide range of medical conditions can now 
be anticipated.
