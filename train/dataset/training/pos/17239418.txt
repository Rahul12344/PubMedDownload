Through yeast two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we have
identified a novel cellular AAV-2 Rep78/Rep68 interaction partner located
predominantly in the cytoplasm. In public databases, it has been assigned as
KCTD5, because of a region of high similarity to the cytoplasmic tetramerization 
domain of voltage-gated potassium channels. Whereas Rep/KCTD5 interaction relied 
on the region surrounding the Rep nuclear localization signal, nuclear
accumulation of Rep was not required. Wildtype Rep78/Rep68 proteins induced the
translocation of large portions of KCTD5 into the nucleus pointing to functional 
interactions both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In line with an anticipated
functional interference in the cytoplasm, KCTD5 overexpression completely
abrogated Rep68-mediated posttranscriptional activation of a HIV-LTR driven
luciferase reporter gene. Our study expands the panel of already identified
nuclear Rep interaction partners to a cytoplasmic protein, which raises the
awareness that important steps in the AAV life cycle may be regulated in this
compartment.
