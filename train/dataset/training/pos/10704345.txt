We report here that E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) forms
a complex in vivo and in vitro with actin, one of the components of the cellular 
cytoskeleton. The in vivo interaction was detected by immunofluorescent staining 
and confocal microscopic examination of normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK)
and CV-1 cells after transient expression of E7 employing the vaccinia virus-T7
RNA polymerase system and by coimmunoprecipitation from an immortalized,
nontumorigenic cell line obtained after transfecting NHOK with the cloned HPV-16 
DNA genome. The in vitro interaction was detected by cosedimentation of
bacterially expressed E7 phosphorylated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate or
purified casein kinase II (CKII) prior to incubation with F-actin. This
interaction was inhibited if E7 phosphorylation by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate
was prevented with heparin, a CKII inhibitor, or if the amino acids Ser-31 and
Ser-32 in E7, which are phosphorylated by CKII, were replaced with amino acids
that cannot be phosphorylated. Interestingly, a decrease in the amount of
polymerized actin occurred in cells expressing E7.
