AIM: To investigate the biological function of F protein by yeast two-hybrid
system.
METHODS: We constructed F protein bait plasmid by cloning the gene of F protein
into pGBKT7, then recombinant plasmid DNA was transformed into yeast AH109 (a
type). The transformed yeast AH109 was mated with yeast Y187 (alpha type)
containing liver cDNA library plasmid in 2XYPDA medium. Diploid yeast was plated 
on synthetic dropout nutrient medium (SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade) containing X-alpha-gal
for selection and screening. After extracting and sequencing plasmids from
positive (blue) colonies, we underwent sequence analysis by bioinformatics.
RESULTS: Thirty-six colonies were selected and sequenced. Among them, 11 colonies
were zymogen granule protein, 5 colonies were zinc finger protein, 4 colonies
were zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, 1 colony was sialyltransferase, 1 colony was
complement control protein factor I, 1 colony was vitronectin, and 2 colonies
were new genes with unknown function.
CONCLUSION: The yeast two-hybrid system is an effective method for identifying
hepatocyte proteins interacting with F protein of hepatitis C virus. F protein
may bind to different proteins.
