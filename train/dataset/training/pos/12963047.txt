Although the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome is synthesized by the virus-encoded
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, other viral and cellular factors are assumed
to be required for template-specific initiation and regulation of RNA-synthesis. 
The cellular protein La, which normally associates with RNA polymerase III
transcripts, also interacts with the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of several
RNA viruses, including HCV. To investigate whether other viral gene products may 
be involved in this interaction, we constructed an HCV cDNA expression library in
bacteriophage T7 allowing portions of the HCV polyprotein to be displayed on the 
phage surface. Screening of the phage library against La resulted in selection of
clones displaying the N-terminal region of HCV NS5A. Co-precipitation of
full-length and truncated forms of recombinant NS5A with La revealed that the
N-terminal region of NS5A was both necessary and sufficient for binding to La.
Although this region of NS5A is essential for HCV replication, the role of the
NS5A-La interaction in the infected cell remains to be established.
