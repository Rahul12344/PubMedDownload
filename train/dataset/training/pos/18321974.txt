During the assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles, the
tetraspanin CD63 can be incorporated into the viral membrane. Indeed, cell
surface tetraspanin microdomains that include CD63 have been proposed as sites
for virus release. In addition, antibodies against CD63 can inhibit HIV infection
of macrophages. In this cell type, HIV assembles into intracellularly sequestered
plasma membrane domains that contain several other tetraspanins, including CD81, 
CD9, and CD53. CD63 is recruited to this domain following HIV infection.
Together, these observations suggest that CD63 may have some function in the
assembly of infectious virus particles and/or the infectivity of assembled
virions. Here we have used RNA interference to knock down CD63 expression in
monocyte-derived primary macrophages. We show that in the absence of CD63, HIV
assembly is quantitatively comparable to that seen in CD63-expressing macrophages
and that virus assembly occurs on compartments positive for CD81, CD9, and CD53. 
Moreover, the infectivity of macrophage-derived virus is unaffected by the loss
of CD63. Together, our results indicate that at least in tissue culture, CD63
expression is not required for either the production or the infectivity of HIV-1.
