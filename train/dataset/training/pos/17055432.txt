Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. While varicella is
likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted
by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is
essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular
receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through 
its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with
antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin
inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by
blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a
plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection
with cell-free and cell-associated virus. These studies indicate that IDE is a
cellular receptor for both cell-free and cell-associated VZV.
