The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a major virulence factor that is
essential for pathogenesis. NS1 functions to impair innate and adaptive immunity 
by inhibiting host signal transduction and gene expression, but its mechanisms of
action remain to be fully elucidated. We show here that NS1 forms an inhibitory
complex with NXF1/TAP, p15/NXT, Rae1/mrnp41, and E1B-AP5, which are key
constituents of the mRNA export machinery that interact with both mRNAs and
nucleoporins to direct mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex. Increased levels
of NXF1, p15, or Rae1 revert the mRNA export blockage induced by NS1.
Furthermore, influenza virus down-regulates Nup98, a nucleoporin that is a
docking site for mRNA export factors. Reduced expression of these mRNA export
factors renders cells highly permissive to influenza virus replication,
demonstrating that proper levels of key constituents of the mRNA export machinery
protect against influenza virus replication. Because Nup98 and Rae1 are induced
by interferons, down-regulation of this pathway is likely a viral strategy to
promote viral replication. These findings demonstrate previously undescribed
influenza-mediated viral-host interactions and provide insights into potential
molecular therapies that may interfere with influenza infection.
