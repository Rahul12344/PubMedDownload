Comment in
    Cell Host Microbe. 2014 Jul 9;16(1):1-2.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are targets of measles virus (MV) and play central roles in
viral dissemination. However, DCs express the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I
and Mda5 that sense MV and induce type I interferon (IFN) production. Given the
potency of this antiviral response, RLRs are tightly regulated at various steps, 
including dephosphorylation by PP1 phosphatases, which induces their activation. 
We demonstrate that MV suppresses RIG-I and Mda5 by activating the C-type lectin 
DC-SIGN and inducing signaling that prevents RLR dephosphorylation. MV binding to
DC-SIGN leads to activation of the kinase Raf-1, which induces the association of
PP1 inhibitor I-1 with GADD34-PP1 holoenzymes, thereby inhibiting phosphatase
activity. Consequently, GADD34-PP1 holoenzymes are unable to dephosphorylate
RIG-I and Mda5, hence suppressing type I IFN responses and enhancing MV
replication. Blocking DC-SIGN signaling allows RLR activation and suppresses MV
infection of DCs. Thus, MV subverts DC-SIGN to control RLR activation and escape 
antiviral responses.
