Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a non-structural protein of avian influenza
virus. It can interact with a variety of proteins of the host cells, enhancing
the expression of viral proteins and changing the growth and metabolism of the
host cells, thereby enhancing the virus' pathogenicity and virulence. To
investigate whether there are more host proteins that can interact with NS1
during viral infection, T7-phage display system was used to screen human lung
cell cDNA library for proteins that could interact with NS1. One positive and
specific clone was obtained and identified as nucleolar and coiled-body
phosphoprotein 1(NOLC1). The interaction between these two proteins was further
demonstrated by His-pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
Co-expression of both proteins in HeLa cell showed that NS1 and NOLC1 were
co-localized in the cell's nucleus. Gene truncation experiments revealed that the
effector domain of NS1 was sufficient to interact with NOLC1. The results
demonstrated a positive interaction between a viral NS1 and NOLC1 of the host
cells, and provided a new target for drug screening.
