The innate immune system detects viral infection predominantly by sensing viral
nucleic acids. We report the identification of a viral sensor, consisting of RNA 
helicases DDX1, DDX21, and DHX36, and the adaptor molecule TRIF, by isolation and
sequencing of poly I:C-binding proteins in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs).
Knockdown of each helicase or TRIF by shRNA blocked the ability of mDCs to mount 
type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine responses to poly I:C, influenza A virus,
and reovirus. Although DDX1 bound poly I:C via its Helicase A domain, DHX36 and
DDX21 bound the TIR domain of TRIF via their HA2-DUF and PRK domains,
respectively. This sensor was localized within the cytosol, independent of the
endosomes. Thus, the DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex represents a dsRNA sensor that uses
the TRIF pathway to activate type I IFN responses in the cytosol of mDCs.
