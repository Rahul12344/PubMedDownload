Adenovirus type 5 encodes a 14.7-kDa protein that protects infected cells from
tumor necrosis factor-induced cytolysis by an unknown mechanism. In this report, 
we demonstrate that infection of cells with an adenovirus vector expressing Fas
ligand induced rapid apoptosis that was blocked by coinfection with a virus
expressing 14. 7K. Moreover, AdFasL/G infection resulted in the rapid activation 
of DEVD-specific caspases, and caspase activation was blocked by coinfection with
Ad14.7/G. Cell death induced by the overexpression of Fas ligand, Fas-associated 
death domain-containing protein (FADD)/MORT1, or FADD-like
interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (FLICE)/caspase-8 in a virus-free system was 
efficiently blocked by 14.7K expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that 14.7K
interacts with FLICE. These results support the idea that FLICE is a cellular
target for the 14.7-kDa protein.
