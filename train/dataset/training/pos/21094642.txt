DYNLL1, the smallest dynein light chain, interacts with different cargos
facilitating their cellular transport. Usually the sequence recognized in the
targets is homologous to the GIQVD or the KXTQT motifs with a glutamine that is
important for binding. Here we add two new examples of DYNLL1 targets that can be
classified into these two groups: ASFV p54 and gephyrin. Using NMR we demonstrate
the direct interaction between DYNLL1 and two peptides derived from their
interacting sequences. We model the structure of both complexes and show that the
overall binding mode is preserved as in other complexes despite differences at
the residue-specific interactions.
