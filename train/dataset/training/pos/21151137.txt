We have identified desmoglein-2 (DSG-2) as the primary high-affinity receptor
used by adenoviruses Ad3, Ad7, Ad11 and Ad14. These serotypes represent key human
pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections. In epithelial cells, 
adenovirus binding of DSG-2 triggers events reminiscent of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, leading to transient opening of
intercellular junctions. This opening improves access to receptors, for example, 
CD46 and Her2/neu, that are trapped in intercellular junctions. In addition to
complete virions, dodecahedral particles (PtDds), formed by excess amounts of
viral capsid proteins, penton base and fiber during viral replication, can
trigger DSG-2-mediated opening of intercellular junctions as shown by studies
with recombinant Ad3 PtDds. Our findings shed light on adenovirus biology and
pathogenesis and may have implications for cancer therapy.
