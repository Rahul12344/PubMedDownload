In higher eukaryotes, the origin recognition complex (ORC) lacks
sequence-specific DNA binding, and it remains unclear what other factors specify 
an origin of DNA replication. The Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid
replication (OriP) recruits ORC, but the precise mechanism of ORC recruitment and
origin activation is not clear. We now show that ORC is recruited selectively to 
the dyad symmetry (DS) region of OriP as a consequence of direct interactions
with telomere repeat factor 2 (TRF2) and ORC1. TRF-binding sites within DS
stimulate replication initiation and facilitate ORC recruitment in vitro and in
vivo. TRF2, but not TRF1 or hRap1, recruits ORC from nuclear extracts. The
amino-terminal domain of TRF2 associated with a specific region of ORC1 and was
necessary for stimulation of DNA replication. These results support a model in
which TRF2 stimulates OriP replication activity by direct binding with ORC
subunits.
