Ultraviolet irradiation (UV) is the major risk factor for the development of skin
cancer. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests cutaneotropic human
papillomaviruses (HPV) from the beta genus to play a causal role as a co-factor
in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Homeodomain-interacting 
protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) operates as a potential suppressor in skin tumorigenesis
and is stabilized by UV-damage. HIPK2 is an important regulator of apoptosis,
which forms a complex with the tumor suppressor p53, mediating p53
phosphorylation at Ser 46 and thus promoting pro-apoptotic gene expression. In
our study, we demonstrate that cutaneous HPV23 E6 protein directly targets HIPK2 
function. Accordingly, HPV23 E6 interacts with HIPK2 both in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, upon massive UVB-damage HPV23 E6 co-localizes with endogenous HIPK2 
at nuclear bodies. Functionally, we demonstrate that HPV23 E6 inhibits
HIPK2-mediated p53 Ser 46 phosphorylation through enforcing dissociation of the
HIPK2/p53 complex. In addition, HPV23 E6 co-accumulates with endogenous HIPK2
upon UV damage suggesting a mechanism by which HPV23 E6 keeps HIPK2 in check
after UV damage. Thus, cutaneous HPV23 E6 prevents HIPK2-mediated p53 Ser 46
phosphorylation, which may favour survival of UV-damaged keratinocytes and skin
carcinogenesis by apoptosis evasion.
