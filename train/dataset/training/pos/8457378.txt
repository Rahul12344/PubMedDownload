Five cDNA clones for TAXREB proteins that bind to the tax-responsive enhancer
element of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) were isolated from a
Jurkat cell cDNA library. The beta-galactosidase fusion proteins of three of
these clones specifically recognized the domain C within the enhancer. One of the
three cDNAs, encoding TAXREB107, contained an open reading frame with 288 amino
acid residues. RNA blot analysis showed that the level of mRNA for TAXREB107
increased transiently in Jurkat cells on treatment with TPA. Immunoblot analysis 
showed that polyclonal antibody against TAXREB107 specifically recognized a 34-kD
protein in Jurkat cells. TAXREB107 may participate in tax-mediated
trans-activation of transcription.
