Retrovirus infection is initiated by binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein
to a cell-surface receptor. The envelope proteins of type C retroviruses of
mammals demonstrate similarities in structural organization and protein sequence.
These similarities suggest the possibility that retroviruses from different
interference groups might use related proteins as receptors, despite the absence 
of any relationship between retrovirus receptors isolated to date. To investigate
this possibility, we have identified a human cDNA clone encoding a protein
closely related to the receptor for gibbon ape leukemia virus and have found that
it functions as the receptor for the amphotropic group of murine retroviruses.
Expression of this protein (GLVR-2) is likely to be a requirement for infection
of human cells by amphotropic retroviral vectors for purposes of gene therapy.
