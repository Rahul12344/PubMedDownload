Proteomic identification of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6-interacting
proteins revealed several proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In
addition to the well-characterized E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase, a second HECT
domain protein (HERC2) and a deubiquitylating enzyme (USP15) were identified by
tandem affinity purification of HPV16 E6-associated proteins. This study focuses 
on the functional consequences of the interaction of E6 with USP15.
Overexpression of USP15 resulted in increased levels of the E6 protein, and the
small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of USP15 decreased E6 protein levels.
These results implicate USP15 directly in the regulation of E6 protein stability 
and suggest that ubiquitylated E6 could be a substrate for USP15 ubiquitin
peptidase activity. It remains possible that E6 could affect the activity of
USP15 on specific cellular substrates, a hypothesis that can be tested as more is
learned about the substrates and pathways controlled by USP15.
