The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latency protein EBNA2 is a nuclear
transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV-induced cellular
transformation. Here, we show that EBNA2 interacts with STAT3, a signal
transducer for an interleukin-6 family cytokine, and enhances the transcriptional
activity of STAT3 by influencing its DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, EBNA2
cooperatively acts on STAT3 activation with LMP1. These data demonstrate that
EBNA2 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of STAT3.
