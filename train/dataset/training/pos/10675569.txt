Polyomavirus reaches the nucleus in a still encapsidated form, and the viral
genome is readily found in association with the nuclear matrix. This association 
is thought to be essential for viral replication. In order to identify the
protein(s) involved in the virus-nuclear matrix interaction, we focused on the
possible roles exerted by the multifunctional cellular nuclear matrix protein Yin
Yang 1 (YY1) and by the viral major capsid protein VP1. In the present work we
report on the in vivo association between YY1 and VP1. Using the yeast two-hybrid
system we demonstrate that the VP1 and YY1 proteins physically interact through
the D-E region of VP1 and the activation domain of YY1.
