During the late phase of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1)
replication cycle, viral Gag proteins and the intact RNA genome are trafficked to
specific sub-cellular membranes where virus assembly and budding occurs.
Targeting to the plasma membranes of T cells and macrophages is mediated by
interactions between the N-terminal matrix (MA) domain of Gag and cellular
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)] molecules. However, in
macrophages and dendritic cells, a subset of Gag proteins appears to be targeted 
to tetraspanin enriched viral compartments, a process that appears to be mediated
by MA interactions with the Delta subunit of the cellular Adaptor Protein AP-3
(AP-3δ). We cloned, overexpressed and purified the protein interactive domain of 
AP-3δ and probed for MA binding by NMR. Unexpectedly, no evidence of binding was 
observed in these in vitro experiments, even at relatively high protein
concentrations (200μM), suggesting that AP-3δ plays an alternative role in HIV-1 
assembly.
