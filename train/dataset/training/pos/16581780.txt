Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein is a membrane-associated phosphoprotein that
possesses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. We recently reported that
NS5A protein interacts with TRAF2 and modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha)-induced NF-kappaB and Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). Since NS5A
and NS5B are the essential components of the HCV replication complex, we examined
whether NS5B could modulate TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB and JNK activation. In
this study, we have demonstrated that TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation is
inhibited by NS5B protein in HEK293 and hepatic cells. Furthermore, NS5B protein 
inhibited both TRAF2- and IKK-induced NF-kappaB activation. Using
coimmunoprecipitation assays, we show that NS5B interacts with IKKalpha. Most
importantly, NS5B protein in HCV subgenomic replicon cells interacted with
endogenous IKKalpha, and then TNF-alpha-mediated IKKalpha kinase activation was
significantly decreased by NS5B. Using in vitro kinase assay, we have further
found that NS5B protein synergistically activated TNF-alpha-mediated JNK activity
in HEK293 and hepatic cells. These data suggest that NS5B protein modulates
TNF-alpha signaling pathways and may contribute to HCV pathogenesis.
