BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a multi-functional viral
protein that interacts with several target proteins of both viral and cellular
origin.
AIM AND METHODS: To gain insight into the mechanism of action of HCV core
protein, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify the core
protein-interacting cellular targets.
RESULTS: A cDNA clone encoding an aspartoacylase was obtained, termed
aspartoacylase 3 (ACY3). Interaction between ACY3 and HCV core protein was
verified using a co-immunoprecipitation assay in vitro, and a mammalian
two-hybrid system in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy showed green fluorescence
protein-fused ACY3 localized in the cytoplasm.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ACY3 is an HCV core binding protein, which may 
play a role in the development of HCV-associated diseases.
