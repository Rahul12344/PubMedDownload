Here we report the cloning and characterization of HIVEP3, the newest member in
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein family that
encodes large zinc finger proteins and regulates transcription via the kappaB
enhancer motif. The largest open reading frame of HIVEP3 contains 2406 aa. and is
approximately 80% identical to the mouse counterpart. The HIVEP3 gene is located 
in the chromosomal region 1p34 and is at least 300 kb with 10 exons. RNA studies 
show that multiple HIVEP3 transcripts are differentially expressed and regulated.
Additionally, transcription termination occurs in the ultimate exon, exon 10, or 
in exon 6. Therefore, HIVEP3 may produce protein isoforms that contain or exclude
the carboxyl DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper by alternative RNA
splicing and differential polyadenylation. Sequence homologous to HIVEP3 exon 6
is not found in mouse nor are the paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2. Zoo-blot
analysis suggests that sequences homologous to the human exon 6 are present only 
in primates and cow. Therefore, a foreign DNA harboring a termination exon likely
was inserted into the HIVEP3 locus relatively recently in evolution, resulting in
the acquisition of novel gene regulatory mechanisms as well as the generation of 
structural and functional diversity.
