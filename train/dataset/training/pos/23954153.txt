Upon activation by the ligands Gas6 and Protein S, Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) receptor
tyrosine kinases promote phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells and downregulate
immune responses initiated by Toll-like receptors and type I interferons (IFNs). 
Many enveloped viruses display the phospholipid phosphatidylserine on their
membranes, through which they bind Gas6 and Protein S and engage TAM receptors.
We find that ligand-coated viruses activate TAM receptors on dendritic cells
(DCs), dampen type I IFN signaling, and thereby evade host immunity and promote
infection. Upon virus challenge, TAM-deficient DCs display type I IFN responses
that are elevated in comparison to wild-type cells. As a consequence,
TAM-deficient DCs are relatively resistant to infection by flaviviruses and
pseudotyped retroviruses, but infection can be restored with neutralizing type I 
IFN antibodies. Correspondingly, a TAM kinase inhibitor antagonizes the infection
of wild-type DCs. Thus, TAM receptors are engaged by viruses in order to
attenuate type I IFN signaling and represent potential therapeutic targets.
