We have found that RNase P from HeLa cells specifically and efficiently cleaves
hepatitis C virus (HCV) transcripts in vitro. The evidence includes
identification of the 5'-phosphate polarity of the newly generated termini at
position A(2860) as well as immunological and biochemical assays. Active cleavage
has been shown in five dominant sequences of HCV "quasispecies" differing at or
near the position of cleavage, demonstrating that this is a general property of
HCV RNA. During the analysis, a second cleavage event was found in the 3' domain 
of the internal ribosome entry site. We have found that HCV RNA competitively
inhibits pre-tRNA cleavage by RNase P, suggesting that HCV RNA has structural
similarities to tRNA. This finding sets HCV apart from other pathogens causing
serious human diseases and represents the first description of human RNase
P-viral RNA cleavage. Here we discuss the possible meaning of these RNase
P-accessible structures built into the viral genome and their possible role in
vivo. Moreover, such structures within the viral genome might be vulnerable to
attack by therapeutic strategies.
