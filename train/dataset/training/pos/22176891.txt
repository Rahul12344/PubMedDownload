BACKGROUND: During the process that AIV infect hosts, the NS1 protein can act on 
hosts, change corresponding signal pathways, promote the translation of virus
proteins and result in virus replication.
RESULTS: In our study, we found that PARP domain and Glu-rich region of PARP10
interacted with NS1, and the presence of NS1 could induce PARP10 migrate from
cytoplasm to nucleus. NS1 high expression could reduce the endogenous PARP10
expression. Cell cycle analysis showed that with inhibited PARP10 expression, NS1
could induce cell arrest in G2-M stage, and the percentage of cells in G2-M stage
rise from the previous 10%-45%, consistent with the cell proliferation result.
Plague forming unit measurement showed that inhibited PARP10 expression could
help virus replication.
CONCLUSIONS: In a word, our results showed that NS1 acts on host cells and PARP10
plays a regulating role in virus replication.
