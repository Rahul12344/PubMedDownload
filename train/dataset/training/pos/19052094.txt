A tight junction (TJ) protein, claudin-1 (CLDN1), was identified recently as a
key factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry. Here, we show that another TJ
protein, occludin, is also required for HCV entry. Mutational study of CLDN1
revealed that its tight junctional distribution plays an important role in
mediating viral entry. Together, these data support the model in which HCV enters
liver cells from the TJ. Interestingly, HCV infection of Huh-7 hepatoma cells
downregulated the expression of CLDN1 and occludin, preventing superinfection.
The altered TJ protein expression may contribute to the morphological and
functional changes observed in HCV-infected hepatocytes.
