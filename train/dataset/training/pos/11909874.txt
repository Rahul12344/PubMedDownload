HIV Tat can enhance activation-induced up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL), which 
may contribute to T cell apoptosis in human immune deficiency virus
(HIV)-infected individuals. We have assessed functional and physical interactions
between Tat and the Egr family of transcription factors (Egr-1, -2, and -3), the 
latter two of which are major participants in activation-induced FasL
up-regulation. Here we report that whereas Tat itself has no effect on the FasL
promoter, it binds to Egr-2 and -3 and synergizes with them to superinduce
expression of a FasL promoter-driven reporter. A Tat molecule containing a single
amino acid substitution that results in the loss of transactivation activity for 
the HIV long terminal repeat still binds Egr-3 but can no longer enhance
Egr-mediated transactivation of the FasL promoter. Furthermore, the mutated Tat
acts as a dominant negative inhibitor, blocking the superinduction of FasL caused
by wild type Tat. Because Tat is present in virus-infected cells and in the serum
of HIV-infected individuals, these results suggest that increased expression of
FasL in these circumstances may result from the cooperative activities of
activation-induced Egrs and Tat.
