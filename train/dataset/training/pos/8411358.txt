In this paper we provide evidence that a fraction of large T antigen of simian
virus 40 (SV40) interacts with cyclin A and p33cdk2 in both virus-infected and
stably transformed cells. Immunoprecipitates of SV40 large T antigen from
SV40-infected or SV40 large-T-antigen-transformed cells contain cyclin A,
p33cdk2, and histone H1 kinase activity. Conversely, immunoprecipitates of cyclin
A from these cells contain SV40 large T antigen. In this respect, SV40 large T
antigen has properties similar to those of the E1A oncogene of adenoviruses and
the E7 oncogene of human papillomaviruses.
