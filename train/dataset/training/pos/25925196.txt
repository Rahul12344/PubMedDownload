OBJECTIVE: The spike (S) protein of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis
virus (PHEV) may mediate infection by binding to a cellular neural cell adhesion 
molecule (NCAM). This study aimed to identify the crucial domain of the S1
subunit of the S protein that interacts with NCAM.
METHODS: Three truncated segments (S(1-291), S(277-794) and S(548-868)) of the S 
gene of PHEV and the NCAM gene were cloned individually into the Escherichia coli
expression vectors and yeast two-hybrid expression vectors. The interaction
between S(1-291), S(277-794), S(548-868) and NCAM were detected by a GST
pull-down experiment and yeast two-hybrid assay.
RESULTS: Three fusion proteins (S(1-291), S(277-794) and S(548-868)) were
screened for their interactions with NCAM by protein-protein interaction assays. 
The results of these assays clarified that S(277-794) interacted with NCAM, while
S(1-291) and S(548-868) did not.
CONCLUSIONS: A small fragment (258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548) on the 
PHEV S protein was posited to be the minimum number of amino acids necessary to
interact with NCAM. This fragment may be the receptor-binding domain that
mediates PHEV binding to NCAM.
