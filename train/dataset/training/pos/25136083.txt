Accumulating evidence indicates that T-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) and mucin domain 
(TIM) proteins play critical roles in viral infections. Herein, we report that
the TIM-family proteins strongly inhibit HIV-1 release, resulting in diminished
viral production and replication. Expression of TIM-1 causes HIV-1 Gag and mature
viral particles to accumulate on the plasma membrane. Mutation of the
phosphatidylserine (PS) binding sites of TIM-1 abolishes its ability to block
HIV-1 release. TIM-1, but to a much lesser extent PS-binding deficient mutants,
induces PS flipping onto the cell surface; TIM-1 is also found to be incorporated
into HIV-1 virions. Importantly, TIM-1 inhibits HIV-1 replication in CD4-positive
Jurkat cells, despite its capability of up-regulating CD4 and promoting HIV-1
entry. In addition to TIM-1, TIM-3 and TIM-4 also block the release of HIV-1, as 
well as that of murine leukemia virus (MLV) and Ebola virus (EBOV); knockdown of 
TIM-3 in differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) enhances HIV-1
production. The inhibitory effects of TIM-family proteins on virus release are
extended to other PS receptors, such as Axl and RAGE. Overall, our study uncovers
a novel ability of TIM-family proteins to block the release of HIV-1 and other
viruses by interaction with virion- and cell-associated PS. Our work provides new
insights into a virus-cell interaction that is mediated by TIMs and PS receptors.
