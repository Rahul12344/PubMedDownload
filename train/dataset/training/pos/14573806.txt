The early protein P35 from the baculovirus Autographa californica
nucleopolyhedrovirus is a direct inhibitor of caspases and can block apoptosis in
a wide variety of systems. In addition, it has been linked to the regulation of
viral gene expression, shut-down of protein synthesis in infected insect cells
and malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts. By yeast-two-hybrid screening 
we identified the RPB11a subunit of human RNA polymerase II as an interaction
partner of P35. Specificity of the interaction was confirmed by affinity
blotting. By immunocytology, P35 was in part found in the nucleus of transfected 
cells. Homology searches further revealed that P35 has structural similarity with
RPB3, the subunit of RNA polymerase II that has been demonstrated to interact
directly with RPB11a. When transfected into human colon carcinoma cells, P35 was 
able to enhance the activity of E-cadherin and beta-actin promoters by about a
factor of two as measured by luciferase reporter assay. P35 and hRPB11a together 
enhanced the E-cadherin activity about three- to fourfold. These data suggest an 
additional role for P35 in the regulation of cellular transcription.
