The influenza virus RNA polymerase synthesizes three types of RNA: genomic vRNA, 
anti-genomic cRNA and mRNA. Both vRNA and cRNA are bound by the viral RNA
polymerase and nucleoprotein to form ribonucleoprotein complexes. Viral mRNAs are
also proposed to be bound by the RNA polymerase to prevent their endonucleolytic 
cleavage, regulate the splicing of M1 mRNA, and facilitate translation. Here, we 
used standard immunoprecipitation, biochemical purification and RNA
immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the association of viral and host
factors with viral mRNA. We found that viral mRNA associates with the viral
non-structural protein 1 (NS1), cellular poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1), the
20 kDa subunit NCBP1 of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), the RNA and export
factor-binding protein REF/Aly and the translation initiation factor eIF4E.
However, our data suggest that the RNA polymerase might not form part of the
viral messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. We propose a model in which
viral mRNAs, by associating with cellular cap-binding proteins, follow the
pathways normally used by cellular mRNAs for splicing, nuclear export and
translation.
