Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified human nucleosome assembly protein 
1 (hNAP-1) as a protein interacting with the activation domain of the
transcriptional activator encoded by papillomaviruses (PVs), the E2 protein. We
show that the interaction between E2 and hNAP-1 is direct and not merely mediated
by the transcriptional coactivator p300, which is bound by both proteins.
Coexpression of hNAP-1 strongly enhances activation by E2, indicating a
functional interaction as well. E2 binds to at least two separate domains within 
hNAP-1, one within the C terminus and an internal domain. The binding of E2 to
hNAP-1 is necessary for cooperativity between the factors. Moreover, the
N-terminal 91 amino acids are crucial for the transcriptional activity of hNAP-1,
since deletion mutants lacking this N-terminal portion fail to cooperate with E2.
We provide evidence that hNAP-1, E2, and p300 can form a ternary complex
efficient in the activation of transcription. We also show that p53 directly
interacts with hNAP-1, indicating that transcriptional activators in addition to 
PV E2 interact with hNAP-1. These results suggest that the binding of
sequence-specific DNA binding proteins to hNAP-1 may be an important step
contributing to the activation of transcription.
