The role of surfactant protein (SP)-A in cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the
lung was investigated. We found that SP-A binds to various immobilized human CMV 
proteins and those exposed on the surface of infected embryonal lung fibroblasts.
The interaction between SP-A and immobilized CMV proteins was found to be
calcium-dependent and inhibited by mannan, suggesting involvement of the
carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A and high-mannose carbohydrate residues of
viral envelope glycoproteins. Using flow cytometry and confocal laser
fluorescence microscopy in the rat model we showed that preincubation of rat CMV 
with SP-A stimulates its binding and internalization by rat type II pneumocytes
and alveolar tissue macrophages. This effect was concentration- and
Ca(2+)-dependent but was not inhibited by mannan. Therefore, the domains of SP-A 
involved in SP-A CMV interaction and in interaction of the SP-A/virus complex
with rat lung cells are distinct. Additionally, in the human CMV model, sheep as 
well as human proteinosis SP-A did not significantly affect human CMV replication
in embryonal lung fibroblasts. Thus, SP-A may contribute to CMV-associated
pathology of the lung by increasing the efficiency of target cell infection.
