While the human antiretroviral defense factors APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are potent
inhibitors of the replication of HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional vif gene, the
Vif protein expressed by wild-type HIV-1 blocks the function of both host cell
proteins. Here, we report that a third human protein, APOBEC3B, is able to
suppress the infectivity of both Vif-deficient and wild-type HIV-1 with equal
efficiency. APOBEC3B, which shows approximately 58% sequence identity to both
APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G, shares the ability of these other human proteins to bind
the nucleocapsid domain of HIV-1 Gag specifically and to thereby package into
progeny virion particles. However, APOBEC3B differs from APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G in
that it is unable to bind to HIV-1 Vif in co-expressing cells and is therefore
efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions regardless of Vif expression.
Unfortunately, APOBEC3B also differs from APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G in that it is not
normally expressed in the lymphoid cells that serve as targets for HIV-1
infection. These studies therefore raise the possibility that activation of the
endogenous APOBEC3B gene in primary human lymphoid cells could form a novel and
effective strategy for inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo.
