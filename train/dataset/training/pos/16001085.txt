HIV-1 transactivator Tat uses cellular acetylation signalling by targeting
several cellular histone acetyltransferases (HAT) to optimize its various
functions. Although Tip60 was the first HAT identified to interact with Tat, the 
biological significance of this interaction has remained obscure. We had
previously shown that Tat represses Tip60 HAT activity. Here, a new mechanism of 
Tip60 neutralization by Tat is described, where Tip60 is identified as a
substrate for the newly reported p300/CBP-associated E4-type ubiquitin-ligase
activity, and Tat uses this mechanism to induce the polyubiquitination and
degradation of Tip60. Tip60 targeting by Tat results in a dramatic impairment of 
the Tip60-dependent apoptotic cell response to DNA damage. These data reveal yet 
unknown strategies developed by HIV-1 to increase cell resistance to genotoxic
stresses and show a role of Tat as a modulator of cellular protein
ubiquitination.
