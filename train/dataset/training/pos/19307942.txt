OBJECTIVE: HIV-1 can use various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in addition 
to CCR5 and CXCR4 as coreceptors; however, this type of HIV-1 infection has
hardly been detected in vivo. The objective of this study was to elucidate the
spectrum of GPCR usage by HIV-1 populations in vivo.
DESIGN: CD4-expressing glioma cell line, NP-2/CD4, becomes highly susceptible to 
HIV-1 when the cells express GPCRs with coreceptor activities. This cell system
was advantageous for detecting the inefficient use of GPCRs by HIV-1.
METHODS: We developed NP-2/CD4/GPCR cells that express each of 23 GPCRs: 21
chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9B,
CCR10, CCR11, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR6, CX3CR1, XCR1, D6, and
DARC) and two other GPCRs (a formylpeptide receptor, FPRL1, and an orphan GPCR,
GPR1). NP-2/CD4/GPCR cells were directly cocultured with HIV-1-positive
peripheral blood lymphocytes and HIV-1 infection was detected.
RESULTS: Primary HIV-1 isolates were obtained from NP-2/CD4/GPCR cells expressing
CCR5, CXCR4, FPRL1, or GPR1 cocultured with 11 of 17 peripheral blood
lymphocytes. Surprisingly, these isolates showed extremely expanded GPCR usage,
such as CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, CCR8, CXCR4, D6, FPRL1, and GPR1 as coreceptors. We
found that CCR9B, CCR10, and XCR1 also work as novel HIV-1 coreceptors.
CONCLUSION: FPRL1 and GPR1 have the potential to work as significant HIV-1
coreceptors in vivo next to CCR5 and CXCR4. HIV-1 populations that can use
various GPCRs as coreceptors are already circulating in vivo, even in the early
stage of HIV-1 infection.
