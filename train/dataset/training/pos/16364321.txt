The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated
nuclear antigen (LANA) is known to modulate viral and cellular gene expression.
We show that LANA directly associates with an interleukin-6 signal transducer,
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and that LANA enhances
the transcriptional activity of STAT3. Coimmunoprecipitation studies documented a
physical interaction between LANA and STAT3 in transiently transfected 293T cells
as well as the KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell line.
Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of LANA expression
decreased the STAT3-dependent transcription in KSHV-positive PEL cells, whereas
overexpression of LANA enhanced STAT3 activity in KSHV-negative B lymphoma cells.
These data demonstrate that LANA is a transcriptional co-activator of STAT3, and 
may have implications for the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated diseases.
