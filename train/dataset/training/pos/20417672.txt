The macrophage-tropic lentivirus, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), encodes 
the small auxiliary protein S2 from a short open reading frame that overlaps the 
amino terminus of env EIAV S2 is dispensable for virus replication in cultured
cells but is required for disease production. S2 is approximately 7 kDa and has
no overall amino acid sequence homology to other cellular or viral proteins.
Therefore it is likely that S2 plays a role as an adaptor protein. To further
investigate S2 function we performed a yeast-2-hybrid screen to identify cellular
proteins that interact with EIAV S2. The screen identified two human cellular
proteins, amplified in osteosarcoma (OS-9) and proteasome 26S ATPase subunit 3
(PSMC3) that interact with S2. The equine homologues of these proteins were
cloned and their interactions with S2 confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation
assays. We identified two OS-9 isoforms that interact with S2 and a third splice 
variant that does not, indicating a region of OS-9 apparently required for the S2
interaction. The roles of these cellular proteins during EIAV infection have not 
been determined.
