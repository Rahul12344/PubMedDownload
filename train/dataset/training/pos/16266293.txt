Breast-feeding-associated protection against calicivirus diarrhoea is associated 
with the presence of high levels of 2-linked oligosaccharides in mother's milk,
and human calicivirus strains including the NV (Norwalk virus) use gut 2-linked
fucosylated glycans as receptors, suggesting the presence of decoy receptors in
milk. Our aim was to analyse the ability of human milk to inhibit the attachment 
of rNV VLPs (recombinant NV-like particles) to their carbohydrate ligands and to 
characterize potential inhibitors found in milk. Milk from women with the
secretor phenotype was strongly inhibitory, unlike milk from women that are
non-secretors, which is devoid of 2-linked fucosylated structures. At least two
fractions in human milk acted as inhibitors for the NV capsid attachment. The
first fraction corresponded to BSSL (bile-salt-stimulated lipase) and the second 
to associated mucins MUC1 and MUC4. These proteins present tandem repeat
O-glycosylated sequences that should act as decoy receptors for the NV, depending
on the combined mother/child secretor status.
