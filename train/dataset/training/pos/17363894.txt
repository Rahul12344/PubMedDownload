Granzymes are key components of the immune response that play important roles in 
eliminating host cells infected by intracellular pathogens. Several granzymes are
potent inducers of cell death. However, whether granzymes use additional
mechanisms to exert their antipathogen activity remains elusive. Here, we show
that in adenovirus-infected cells in which granzyme B (gzmB) and downstream
apoptosis pathways are inhibited, granzyme H (gzmH), an orphan granzyme without
known function, directly cleaves the adenovirus DNA-binding protein (DBP), a
viral component absolutely required for viral DNA replication. We directly
addressed the functional consequences of the cleavage of the DBP by gzmH through 
the generation of a virus that encodes a gzmH-resistant DBP. This virus
demonstrated that gzmH directly induces an important decay in viral DNA
replication. Interestingly, gzmH also cleaves the adenovirus 100K assembly
protein, a major inhibitor of gzmB, and relieves gzmB inhibition. These results
provide the first evidence that granzymes can mediate antiviral activity through 
direct cleavage of viral substrates, and further suggest that different granzymes
have synergistic functions to outflank viral defenses that block host antiviral
activities.
