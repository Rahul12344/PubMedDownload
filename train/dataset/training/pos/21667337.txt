In light of the scarcity of reports on the interaction between HSV-1 nucleocapsid
protein UL25 and its host cell proteins, the purpose of this study is to use
yeast two-hybrid screening to search for cellular proteins that can interact with
the UL25 protein. C9orf69, a protein of unknown function was identified. The
interaction between the two proteins under physiological conditions was also
confirmed by biological experiments including co-localization by fluorescence and
immunoprecipitation. A preliminary study of the function of C9orf69 showed that
it promotes viral proliferation. Further studies showed that C9orf69 did not
influence viral multiplication efficiency by transcriptional regulation of viral 
genes, but indirectly promoted proliferation via interaction with UL25.
