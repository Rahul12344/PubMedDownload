A unique feature of the cancer-causing mucosotropic human papillomaviruses (HPVs)
is the ability of their E6 proteins to interact with a number of PDZ
domain-containing cellular substrates, including the cell polarity regulators
hDlg and hScrib. These interactions are essential for the ability of these
viruses to induce malignant progression. Rhesus papillomaviruses (RhPV) are
similar to their human counterparts in that they also cause anogenital malignancy
in their host, the Rhesus Macaque. However, unlike HPV E6, the RhPV E6 has no
PDZ-binding motif. We now show that such a motif is present on the RhPV E7
oncoprotein. This motif specifically confers PDZ-binding activity and directs the
interaction of RhPV E7 with the cell polarity regulator Par3, which it targets
for proteasome-mediated degradation. These results demonstrate an amazing
evolutionary conservation of function between the RhPV and the HPV oncoproteins, 
where both target proteins of the same cell polarity control network, although
through different components and pathways.
