Acute oncogenic stress can activate autophagy and facilitate permanent arrest of 
the cell cycle through a failsafe mechanism known as oncogene-induced senescence 
(OIS). Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) proteins are known to
subvert autophagic pathways, but the link to Kaposi's sarcoma pathogenesis is
unclear. We find that oncogenic assault caused by latent KSHV infection elicits
DNA damage responses (DDRs) characteristic of OIS, yet infected cells display
only modest levels of autophagy and fail to senesce. These aberrant responses
result from the combined activities of tandemly expressed KSHV v-cyclin and
v-FLIP proteins. v-Cyclin deregulates the cell cycle, triggers DDRs, and if left 
unchecked can promote autophagy and senescence. However, during latency v-FLIP
blocks v-cyclin-induced autophagy and senescence in a manner that requires intact
v-FLIP ATG3-binding domains. Together, these data reveal a coordinated viral gene
expression program that usurps autophagy, blocks senescence, and facilitates the 
proliferation of KSHV-infected cells.
