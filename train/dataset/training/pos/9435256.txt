The human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is associated with adult T cell leukemia
and neurological disorders (TSP/HAM). The HTLV transcriptional transactivator,
Tax, is known to exert its effect through protein-protein interaction with
several transcription factors that activate genes in T cell proliferation. The
pathogenic mechanism in the CNS is less defined. Using the yeast two-hybrid
system, we have identified a specific Tax-binding protein as the neuronal
specific intermediate filament protein, alpha-internexin. Tax binds to the domain
corresponding to the rod region of alpha-internexin, which is essential for
neurofilament assembly. The Tax domains involved in binding are separable from
those involved in transactivation. TxBP-1/alpha-internexin and Tax are expressed 
in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, when expressed alone, but in
coexpressing cells, colocalization of both proteins was observed in a
perinuclear, punctate distribution. This in vivo interaction also resulted in a
dramatic reduction in Tax transactivation and the network formation by
alpha-internexin. The specific interaction of Tax and a neuronal specific
intermediate filament protein may provide a clue to the pathogenesis of TSP/HAM.
