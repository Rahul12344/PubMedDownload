NS3, a non-structural protein of the HCV (hepatitis C virus), contains a protease
and a helicase domain and plays essential roles in the processing of the viral
polyprotein, viral RNA replication and translation. LMP7 (low-molecular-mass
protein 7), a component of the immunoproteasome, was identified as an NS3-binding
protein from yeast two-hybrid screens, and this interaction was confirmed by in
vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. The minimal domain of
interaction was defined to be between the pro-sequence region of LMP7 (amino
acids 1-40) and the protease domain of NS3. To elucidate the biological
importance of this interaction, we studied the effect of this interaction on NS3 
protease activity and on LMP7 immunoproteasome activity. Recombinant LMP7 did not
have any effect on NS3 protease activity in vitro. The peptidase activities of
LMP7 immunoproteasomes, however, were markedly reduced when tested in a stable
cell line containing a HCV subgenomic replicon. The down-regulation of proteasome
peptidase activities could interfere with the processing of viral antigens for
presentation by MHC class I molecules, and may thus protect HCV from host immune 
surveillance mechanisms to allow persistent infection by the virus.
