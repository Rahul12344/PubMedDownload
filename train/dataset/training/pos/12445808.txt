By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding
protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor
6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the
NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central
portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain
were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and
CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by
co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific
antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity
with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although the
interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta.
CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the
possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress through
the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha.
