Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) is one of a family of enzymes that catalyze protein 
modification through the incorporation of polyamines into substrates or the
formation of protein crosslinks. However, the physiological roles of TGase 2 are 
largely unknown. To elucidate the functions of TGase 2, we have searched for its 
interacting proteins. Here we show that TGase 2 interacts with E7 oncoprotein of 
human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) in vitro and in vivo. TGase 2 incorporates
polyamines into a conserved glutamine residue in the zinc-binding domain of HPV18
E7 protein. This modification mediates the inhibition of E7's Rb binding ability.
In contrast, TGase 2 does not affect HPV16 E7, due to absence of a glutamine
residue at this polyamination site. Using E7 mutants, we demonstrate that TGase
2-dependent inhibition of HPV E7 function correlates with the presence of the
polyamination site. Our results indicate that TGase 2 is an important cellular
interfering factor and define a novel host-virus interaction, suggesting that the
inability of TGase 2 to inactivate HPV16 E7 could explain the high prevalence of 
HPV16 in cervical cancer.
