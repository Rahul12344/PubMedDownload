Gene expression control largely depends on ribonucleoprotein complexes regulating
mRNA translation. Initiation of translation in mRNAs that overcome cap-dependent 
translation inhibition is often driven by internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
elements, whose activity is regulated by multifunctional RNA-binding factors.
Here we show that Gemin5 interacts preferentially with a specific domain of a
viral IRES consisting of a hairpin flanked by A/U/C-rich sequences. RNA-binding
assays using purified proteins revealed that Gemin5-IRES interaction depends on
the C-terminal region of the protein. Consistent with this novel finding, the
C-terminal region of Gemin5, but not the N-terminal region, impaired translation.
Furthermore, RNA selective 2'hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension
(SHAPE) reactivity demonstrated that addition of purified Gemin5 to IRES mRNA
induced the specific protection of residues around the hairpin of the IRES
element. We further demonstrate that Gemin5 out-competed SHAPE reactivity
variations induced by the IRES-binding factor PTB, leading to a local
conformational change in the IRES structure. Together, our data unveil the
inhibitory mechanism of Gemin5 on IRES-mediated translation.
