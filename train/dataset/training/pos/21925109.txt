Many viruses deliver their genomes into the host cell nucleus for replication.
However, the size restrictions of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which regulates
the passage of proteins, nucleic acids, and solutes through the nuclear envelope,
require virus capsid uncoating before viral DNA can access the nucleus. We report
a microtubule motor kinesin-1-mediated and NPC-supported mechanism of adenovirus 
uncoating. The capsid binds to the NPC filament protein Nup214 and kinesin-1
light-chain Klc1/2. The nucleoporin Nup358, which is bound to Nup214/Nup88,
interacts with the kinesin-1 heavy-chain Kif5c to indirectly link the capsid to
the kinesin motor. Kinesin-1 disrupts capsids docked at Nup214, which compromises
the NPC and dislocates nucleoporins and capsid fragments into the cytoplasm. NPC 
disruption increases nuclear envelope permeability as indicated by the nuclear
influx of large cytoplasmic dextran polymers. Thus, kinesin-1 uncoats viral
DNA and compromises NPC integrity, allowing viral genomes nuclear access to
promote infection.
