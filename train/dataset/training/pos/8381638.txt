Glucose oxidase and peroxidase (lactoperoxidase or myeloperoxidase) are virucidal
to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the presence of sodium iodide, 
as assessed by the loss of viral replication in a syncytium-forming assay or by
the inhibition of cytopathic effects on infected cells. In the presence of low
concentrations of sodium iodide, five HIV-1 isolates were equally susceptible to 
this virucidal system at enzyme concentrations of a few milliunits. The loss of
viral replication was linearly related to the time of incubation in the enzyme
solutions, with an inactivation rate of 1 log unit every 30 min. These enzymes
and this halide were also cytotoxic to chronically infected, but not to
uninfected, cultured CEM cells. Protein conjugates were prepared by using the
enzymes and murine antibody 105.34, which recognized the V3 loop of HIV-1 LAI
isolate surface glycoprotein, or recombinant human CD4. The protein conjugates
inactivated free virus at rates similar to those of the free enzymes and were
more effective than antibody or recombinant CD4 alone. These in vitro findings
demonstrate that the peroxidase-H2O2-halide system provides potent virucidal
activity against HIV-1.
