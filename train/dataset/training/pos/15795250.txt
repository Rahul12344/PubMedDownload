Tankyrase (TNKS) is a telomere-associated poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) that 
has been implicated along with several telomere repeat binding factors in the
regulation of Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication (OriP). We now
show that TNKS1 can bind to the family of repeats (FR) and dyad symmetry regions 
of OriP by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and DNA affinity
purification. TNKS1 and TNKS2 bound to EBNA1 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments
with transfected cell lysates and with purified recombinant proteins in vitro.
Two RXXPDG-like TNKS-interacting motifs in the EBNA1 amino-terminal domain
mediated binding with the ankyrin repeat domain of TNKS. Mutations of both motifs
at EBNA1 G81 and G425 abrogated TNKS binding and enhanced EBNA1-dependent
replication of OriP. Small hairpin RNA targeted knock-down of TNKS1 enhanced
OriP-dependent DNA replication. Overexpression of TNKS1 or TNKS2 inhibited
OriP-dependent DNA replication, while a PARP-inactive form of TNKS2 (M1045V) was 
compromised for this inhibition. We show that EBNA1 is subject to PAR
modification in vivo and to TNKS1-mediated PAR modification in vitro. These
results indicate that TNKS proteins can interact directly with the EBNA1 protein,
associate with the FR region of OriP in vivo, and inhibit OriP replication in a
PARP-dependent manner.
