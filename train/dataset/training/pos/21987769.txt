The Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) protein VP35 is multifunctional; it inhibits IFN-α/β
production and functions as a cofactor of the viral RNA polymerase. Mass
spectrometry identified the double stranded RNA binding protein 76
(DRBP76/NFAR-1/NF90) as a cellular factor that associates with the VP35
C-terminal interferon inhibitory domain (IID). DRBP76 is described to regulate
host cell protein synthesis and play an important role in host defense. The
VP35-IID-DRBP76 interaction required the addition of exogenous dsRNA, but
full-length VP35 associated with DRBP76 in the absence of exogenous dsRNA. Cells 
infected with a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-expressing VP35 redistributed
DRBP76 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the compartment in which EBOV
replicates. Overexpression of DRBP76 did not alter the ability of VP35 to inhibit
type I IFN production but did impair the function of the EBOV
transcription/replication complex. These data suggest that DRBP76, via its
association with VP35, exerts an anti-EBOV function.
