The poxvirus molluscum contagiosum (MC) has a worldwide distribution and its
prevalence is on the rise. Here we report that the MCV MC013L protein inhibits
glucocorticoid and vitamin D, but not retinoid or estrogen, nuclear receptor
transactivation. A direct interaction of MC013L with glucocorticoid and vitamin D
receptor is supported by yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and far Western blot
analyses. Glucocorticoids act as potent inhibitors of keratinocyte proliferation,
while vitamin D and retinoids promote and block terminal differentiation,
respectively. Therefore, MC013L may promote efficient virus replication by
blocking the differentiation of infected keratinocytes. MC013L may be the first
member of a new class of poxvirus proteins that directly modulate nuclear
receptor-mediated transcription.
