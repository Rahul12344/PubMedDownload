The generation of peptides presented by MHC class I molecules requires the
proteolytic activity of the proteasome and/or other peptidases. The processing of
a short vaccinia virus-encoded antigen can take place by a proteasome-independent
pathway involving initiator caspase-5 and -10, which generate antigenic peptides 
recognized by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. In the present study, comparing single versus
double enzyme digestions by mass spectrometry analysis, both qualitative and
quantitative differences in the products obtained were identified. These in vitro
data suggest that each enzyme can use the degradation products of the other as
substrate for new cleavages, indicating concerted endoproteolytic activity of
caspase-5 and -10.
