SR proteins purified from uninfected HeLa cells inhibit adenovirus IIIa pre-mRNA 
splicing by binding to the intronic IIIa repressor element (3RE). In contrast, SR
proteins purified from late adenovirus-infected cells are functionally
inactivated as splicing repressor proteins by a virus-induced dephosphorylation. 
We have shown that the adenovirus E4-ORF4 protein, which binds the cellular
protein phos phatase 2A (PP2A) and activates IIIa splicing in vitro and in vivo, 
induces SR protein dephosphorylation. Here we show that E4-ORF4 interacts with
only a subset of SR proteins present in HeLa cells. Thus, E4-ORF4 interacts
efficiently with SF2/ASF and SRp30c, but not with other SR proteins.
Interestingly, E4-ORF4 interacts with SF2/ASF through the latter's RNA
recognition motifs. Furthermore, E4-ORF4 interacts preferentially with the
hyperphosphorylated form of SR proteins found in uninfected HeLa cells. E4-ORF4
mutant proteins that fail to bind strongly to PP2A or SF2/ASF do not relieve the 
repressive effect of HeLa SR proteins on IIIa pre-mRNA splicing in transient
transfection experiments, suggesting that an interaction between all three
proteins is required for E4-ORF4-induced SR protein dephosphorylation.
