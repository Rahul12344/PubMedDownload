Dendritic cells (DCs) express multiple Toll-like receptors (TLR) in distinct
cellular locations. Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) have been reported to engage
both the surface TLR2 and intracellular TLR9 in conventional DCs. However, the
contributions of these TLRs in recognition of HSV and the induction of
proinflammatory cytokines in DCs remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a rare
population of HSV, both in laboratory strains and in primary clinical isolates
from humans, has the capacity to activate TLR2. This virus population is
recognized through both TLR2 and TLR9 for the induction of IL-6 and IL-12
secretion from bone marrow-derived DCs. Further, we describe a previously
uncharacterized pathway of viral recognition in which TLR2 and TLR9 are engaged
in sequence within the same DC. Live viral infection results in two additional
agonists of TLR2 and TLR9. These results indicate that in cells that express
multiple TLRs, pathogens that contain multiple pathogen-associated molecular
patterns can be detected in an orchestrated sequence and suggest that the innate 
immune system in DCs is optimized to linking uptake and degradation of pathogens 
to microbial recognition.
