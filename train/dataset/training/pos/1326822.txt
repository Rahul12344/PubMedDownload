Gene expression of visna virus is highly restricted in monocytes, but is induced 
when monocytes differentiate into macrophages. A previous study on differential
regulation of visna virus gene expression revealed that a specific AP-1 site in
the long terminal repeat of the viral DNA is required for phorbol-ester-induced
gene expression in macrophages (Gabuzda, Hess, Small, and Clements, Mol. Cell.
Biol., 9, 2728-2733). In the present investigation, we examined the association
of two DNA binding proteins, the proto-oncogene proteins FOS and JUN, with this
AP-1 site in the visna virus LTR. We demonstrated that the concentrations of
these two proteins and their mRNAs increased in U937 cells after phorbol ester
induction. Furthermore, the binding of cellular proteins from the U937 nuclear
extracts to this AP-1 site was significantly decreased in the presence of
antibodies to JUN and FOS. In vitro-translated JUN protein also binds to this
AP-1 sequence, and this binding is enhanced by the FOS protein. These results
indicate that JUN and FOS are directly involved in the differential regulation of
visna virus gene expression.
