Most retroviruses express all of their genes from a single primary transcript. In
order to allow expression of more than one gene from this RNA, differential
splicing is extensively used. Cellular quality control mechanisms retain and
degrade unspliced or partially spliced RNAs in the nucleus. Two pathways have
been described that explain how retroviruses circumvent this nuclear export
inhibition. One involves a constitutive transport element in the viral RNA that
interacts with the cellular mRNA transporter proteins NXF1 and NXT1 to facilitate
nuclear export. The other pathway relies on the recognition of a viral RNA
element by a virus-encoded protein that interacts with the karyopherin CRM1. In
this report, we analyze the protein factors required for the nuclear export of
unspliced foamy virus (FV) mRNA. We show that this export is CRM1 dependent. In
contrast to other complex retroviruses, FVs do not encode an export-mediating
protein. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the cellular protein HuR binds 
to the FV RNA. Inhibition studies showed that both ANP32A and ANP32B, which are
known to bridge HuR and CRM1, are essential for FV RNA export. By using this
export pathway, FVs solve a central problem of viral replication.
