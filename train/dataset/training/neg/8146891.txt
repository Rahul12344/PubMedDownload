BACKGROUND: When the first-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of
antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) was approved in May 1990, blood banking 
agencies recommended testing of all components in inventory. In many cases, one
or more components from these units had already been transfused.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donors that reacted in first-generation EIAs and
recipients of their components were identified, and anti-HCV test methods
(including first-generation EIA, second-generation EIA, and recombinant
immunoblot assay [RIBA]) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 66 donors identified as anti-HCV-positive by first-generation EIA, 17
were positive in second-generation EIA. Of these 17, 9 reacted in RIBA; 6 of
these showed evidence of HCV infection in polymerase chain reaction (4) and/or
probable transmission of HCV to a transfusion recipient (3). Of the 48 specimens 
that were positive in first-generation EIA and negative in second-generation EIA,
only 1 was positive in RIBA; serum was not available for polymerase chain
reaction testing, and there were no living transfusion recipients in whom to
assess evidence of transmission of HCV.
CONCLUSION: This study documents the low predictive value of EIAs for anti-HCV in
a low-prevalence blood donor population and emphasizes the need for additional
testing to confirm the specificity of samples that react in the screening tests.
