OBJECTIVES: The use of tenofovir is highly associated with the emergence of
mutation K65R, which confers broad resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogue
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), especially when tenofovir is combined
with other NRTIs also selecting for K65R. Although recent HIV-1 treatment
guidelines discouraging these combinations resulted in reduced K65R selection
with tenofovir, updated information on the impact of currently recommended
regimens on the population selection rate of K65R is presently lacking.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated changes over time in the selection rate of
resistance mutation K65R in a large population of 2736 HIV-1-infected patients
failing combination antiretroviral treatment between 2002 and 2010.
RESULTS: The K65R resistance mutation was detected in 144 patients, a prevalence 
of 5.3%. A large majority of observed K65R cases were explained by the use of
tenofovir, reflecting its wide use in clinical practice. However, changing
patterns over time in NRTIs accompanying tenofovir resulted in a persistent
decreasing probability of K65R selection by tenofovir-based therapy. The
currently recommended NRTI combination tenofovir/emtricitabine was associated
with a low probability of K65R emergence. For any given dual NRTI combination
including tenofovir, higher selection rates of K65R were consistently observed
with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor than with a protease
inhibitor as the third agent.
DISCUSSION: Our finding of a stable time trend of K65R despite elevated use of
tenofovir illustrates increased potency of current HIV-1 therapy including
tenofovir.
