Bacteriophage (phage) have attractive advantages as delivery systems compared
with mammalian viruses, but have been considered poor vectors because they lack
evolved strategies to confront and overcome mammalian cell barriers to infective 
agents. We reasoned that improved efficacy of delivery might be achieved through 
structural modification of the viral capsid to avoid pre- and postinternalization
barriers to mammalian cell transduction. We generated multifunctional hybrid
adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) particles to enable simultaneous display of
targeting ligands on the phage's minor pIII proteins and also
degradation-resistance motifs on the very numerous pVIII coat proteins. This
genetic strategy of directed evolution bestows a next-generation of AAVP
particles that feature resistance to fibrinogen adsorption or neutralizing
antibodies and ability to escape endolysosomal degradation. This results in
superior gene transfer efficacy in vitro and also in preclinical mouse models of 
rodent and human solid tumors. Thus, the unique functions of our next-generation 
AAVP particles enable improved targeted gene delivery to tumor cells.
