It has long been accepted that the response of T cells to a protein antigen is
strongly influenced by parameters governing processing and presentation of the
immunodominant epitopes. Recent evidence has suggested, however, that subtle
changes in the nature of the ligand itself may also affect the outcome of T-cell 
receptor (TCR) ligation, necessitating a re-evaluation of previously accepted
paradigms of T-cell activation. In particular, activation may no longer be
regarded as an all-or-nothing event, but appears to involve both quantitative and
qualitative dimensions. This revolution in our understanding has emanated from
the recent discovery that analogues of immunogenic peptides, so-called altered
peptide ligands (APLs), may elicit a subset of normal activation events, or
profoundly influence responses to the wild-type epitope. As such, the potential
offered by APLs for modifying the outcome of deleterious immune responses
involved in autoimmunity has not passed unnoticed. Indeed, the design and
exploitation of novel reagents based on the structure of autoantigenic epitopes
has enjoyed some measure of success in the treatment of experimental models of
autoimmune disease and holds promise for their exploitation within the clinical
arena.
