The 28th International Papillomavirus Conference, hosted by the University of
Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center, attracted approximately 1500
participants from 75 countries. The purpose of the meeting was mainly to provide 
a forum for the exchange of new knowledge; the status of HPV research and its
future direction and the impact of current strategies for the prevention and
control of HPV burden and HPV-related conditions. The meeting program consisted
of a clinical workshop and a public health workshop followed by the main
conference program. The main conference featured five breakfast sessions, four
plenary sessions and 22 satellite symposia. Over 800 posters, 167 oral
presentations and 53 poster-oral presentations were presented. This article
highlights the most important issues discussed in HPV, which will be of interest 
to those working in the field of HPV vaccines.
