The recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Argentina, Europe, Japan,
the Republic of Korea, South Africa and Uruguay have brought to world attention
the devastating effects of the disease in a na√Øve population and the social and
economic costs of control and eradication. The fact that much still remains
unknown about the natural history of FMD virus came as a surprise to some. This
paper attempts to identify where research should be directed in order to be
better prepared in the future.
