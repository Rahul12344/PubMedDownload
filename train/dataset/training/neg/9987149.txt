Murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is a model for the study of the pathogenesis
of gamma-herpesviruses. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly related
gamma-herpesvirus that causes significant disease in humans. The major membrane
antigen gp350 of EBV is a candidate vaccine antigen for protection against
EBV-related disease. An MHV-68 glycoprotein, gp150, has significant homology to
EBV gp350. We have therefore used the MHV-68 gp150 to model the potential
efficacy of EBV gp350 in protecting from virus-associated disease. A recombinant 
vaccinia virus expressing MHV-68 gp150 was constructed. This recombinant vaccinia
virus was used to infect mice via the subcutaneous route. This vaccination
resulted in production of MHV-68-neutralising antibodies. Mice were then
challenged intra-nasally with MHV-68. MHV-68-associated mononucleosis was
virtually abrogated in immunised mice. However, mice did establish MHV-68
latency. The results suggest that gp350 may be effective as an immunogen to
prevent EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis in humans that are
EBV-seronegative.
