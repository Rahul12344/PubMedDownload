The biological form of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse
transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer consisting of two polypeptides, p66 and p51, 
which have identical N-termini. The p51 polypeptide is generated by action of
viral protease cleaving the p66 polypeptide between residues Phe440 and Tyr441.
Dimerization has been mostly studied using bacterially purified RT bearing amino 
acid changes in either subunit, but not in the context of HIV-1 particles. We
introduced changes of conserved amino acid residues 430-438 into the
protease-sensitive subdomain of the p66 subunit and analyzed the reverse
transcriptase processing and function using purified variants and their
corresponding HIV-1 recombinant clones. Our mutational analysis shows that the
conserved Glu438 residue is critical for proper heterodimerization and function
of virion-associated RT, but not of bacterially expressed RT. In contrast, the
conserved Glu430, Glu432, and Pro433 residues are not important for dimerization 
of virion-associated RT. The network of interactions made by the Glu438 carboxyl 
group with neighboring residues is critical to protect the Phe440-Tyr441 from
cleavage in the context of the p66/p51 heterodimer and may explain why the
p66/p51 is not processed further to p51/p51.
