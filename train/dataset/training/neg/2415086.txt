Homologous interference by a foot-and-mouth disease virus strain attenuated for
cattle.

Polacino P, Kaplan G, Palma EL.

An attenuated strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of the A24 Cruzeiro
subtype grew less well than wild-type virus in primary bovine fetal kidney (PBK) 
cells resulting in a 4-log lowered efficiency of plaque formation. Both wild-type
and attenuated virus grew equally well in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and in 
suckling mice. Using PBK cells, virus-specific RNA of the wild-type accumulated
up to 6 hours after infection. In contrast, PBK cells infected with the
attenuated strain made less than 20 per cent of the RNA synthesized by wild-type 
virus. Infection of the cell with wild-type virus followed by superinfection with
attenuated virus led to almost complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, an
effect which is dependent on the concentration of input attenuated virus. Three
subsequent undiluted successive passages of the attenuated virus resulted in a
preparation which no longer interfered with wild-type RNA synthesis and which
induced more of its own viral RNA synthesis in PBK cells. The basis of this
interference was considered. Interference occurred intracellularly and was
directed only against viruses within the genus FMDV. A role for interferon was
ruled out. Attempts to demonstrate the physical presence of defective interfering
(DI) particles of FMDV in the attenuated strain failed; but, cyclic patterns of
infectivity were produced during successive undiluted passages.
