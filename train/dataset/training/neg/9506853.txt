Insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cell lines represent a promising approach for
treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Such cell lines can provide an 
abundant and reproducible source of beta-cell material for transplantation. A
number of highly differentiated beta-cell lines have been developed using
transgenic mice. These cells produce insulin amounts comparable to normal
pancreatic islets and release it in response to physiological insulin
secretagogues. Our laboratory has employed a reversible transformation approach
to tightly regulate cell replication in these beta-cell lines, both in culture
and in vivo. Beta-cell lines can be modulated by gene transfer to improve their
function and survival. We have utilized adenovirus genes, which downregulate
antigen presentation and increase cell resistance to cytokines, to facilitate
transplantation of mouse beta cells across allogeneic barriers. These approaches 
could be applied to the development of human beta-cell lines by genetic
engineering of isolated human islets.
