BACKGROUND: The association between hospitalization for respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) infection in infancy and asthma/wheezing in later life has long been 
studied. However, no published studies have combined systematic review and
meta-analysis of existing evidence.
PURPOSE: To quantify the link between RSV hospitalization in early life and
subsequent diagnosis of asthma.
METHOD: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.
Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they assessed the association between 
RSV-confirmed hospitalization for up to 3 years of age and asthma/wheezing later 
in life. Potential sources of heterogeneity were identified by stratified
analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty articles representing 15 unique studies of 82,008 unique
individuals (including 1533 with RSV-confirmed hospitalization) were selected for
meta-analysis. Children who had RSV disease in early life had a higher incidence 
of asthma/wheezing in later life (odds ratio: 3.84; 95% confidence interval:
3.23-4.58). There was moderate heterogeneity between studies (I² = 45%). The
association was found to decrease with age at follow-up, consistent with the
findings of longitudinal studies. When age at follow-up was considered,
heterogeneity was low (residual I² = 17%).
LIMITATIONS: Study quality was generally poor because randomization to
hospitalization for RSV infection was not possible, appropriate blinding was rare
and adjustment for confounding variables was not always appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis suggests an association between infant RSV
hospitalization and respiratory morbidity that decreases with age. If the
association is causal, the development of an effective vaccine against RSV could 
decrease the burden of asthma.
