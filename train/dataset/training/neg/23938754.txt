Mammalian DNA is littered with the signatures of past retroviral infections. For 
example, at least 8% of the human genome can be attributed to endogenous
retroviruses (ERVs). We take a single-locus approach to develop a simple
susceptible-infected-recovered model to investigate the circumstances under which
a disease-causing retrovirus can become incorporated into the host genome and
spread through the host population if it were to confer an immunological
advantage. In the absence of any fitness benefit provided by the long terminal
repeat (LTR), we conclude that signatures of ERVs are likely to go to fixation
within a population when the probability of evolving cellular/humoral immunity to
a related exogenous version of the virus is extremely small. We extend this model
to examine whether changing the speed of the host life history influences the
likelihood that an exogenous retrovirus will incorporate and spread to fixation. 
Our results reveal the parameter space under which incorporation of exogenous
retroviruses into a host genome may be beneficial to the host. In our final
model, we find that the likelihood of an LTR reaching fixation in a host
population is not strongly affected by host life history.
