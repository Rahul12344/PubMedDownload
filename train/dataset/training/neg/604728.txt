Demonstration of specific antibodies in the central nervous system of horses
naturally infected with Borna disease virus.

Ludwig H, Thein P.

From 18 horses with clinical symptoms of an affection of the central nervous
system and with histopathologic alterations in the brain, four were demonstrated 
to have Bornavirus-specific antibodies. The antibodies are monospecific,
recognizing identical antigens from infected brains of different animal species
as well as from persistently infected tissue culture cells. Discrete
immunoglobulin species (oligoclonal IgG) can be demonstrated in concentrated
horse cerebrospinal fluid; they carry Bornavirus antibody specificity. Their
presence, together with the higher antibody titers in the cerebrospinal fluid as 
compared to those in the serum, indicate that in these natural Bornavirus
infections local antibody production occurred in the central nervous system.
