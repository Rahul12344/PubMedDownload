Golgins are coiled-coil proteins involved in Golgi architecture and function. A
complex of golgins (p115, GM130 and giantin), together with the rab1 guanosine
triphosphatase and cis Golgi SNAREs, helps to mediate fusion processes at the
entry face of the Golgi apparatus. The C-terminal acidic domain of p115 binds
specifically to GM130 and giantin. However, deletion of this domain in vivo
appears to have no effect on exocytic transport when using an RNA interference
depletion/rescue approach (Puthenveedu MA, Linstedt AD. Gene replacement reveals 
that p115/SNARE interactions are essential for Golgi biogenesis. Proc Natl Acad
Sci U S A 2004;101:1253-1256). In this study, we have used a different approach
introducing a tobacco etch virus (tev) protease cleavage site into p115 so that
the C-terminal domain can be rapidly and specifically released in vivo by
microinjection of the tev protease. The results show that cleavage inhibits
exocytic transport to the cell surface.
