Influenza A virus infections occur in different species, causing mild to severe
respiratory symptoms that lead to a heavy disease burden. Eurasian avian-like
swine influenza A(H1N1) viruses (EAS-H1N1) are predominant in pigs and
occasionally infect humans. An influenza A(H1N1) virus was isolated from a boy
who was suffering from fever and headache and designated as
A/Tianjin-baodi/1606/2018(H1N1). Full-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
revealed that A/Tianjin-baodi/1606/2018(H1N1) is a novel reassortant EAS-H1N1
containing gene segments from EAS-H1N1 (HA and NA), classical swine H1N1(NS) and 
A(H1N1)pdm09(PB2, PB2, PA, NP and M) viruses. The isolation and analysis of
A/Tianjin-baodi/1606/2018(H1) provide further evidence that EAS-H1N1 poses a
threat to human health and greater attention should be paid to surveillance of
influenza virus infection in pigs and humans.
