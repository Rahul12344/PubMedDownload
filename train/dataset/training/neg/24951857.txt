Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate energy homeostasis by coordinating
various physiological responses. Past studies have shown the role of the orexin
peptide itself; however, orexin neurons contain not only orexin but also other
neurotransmitters such as glutamate and dynorphin. In this study, we examined the
physiological role of orexin neurons in feeding behavior and metabolism by
pharmacogenetic activation and chronic ablation. We generated novel orexin-Cre
mice and utilized Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus vectors to express
Gq-coupled modified GPCR, hM3Dq or diphtheria toxin fragment A in orexin neurons.
By intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N oxide in orexin-Cre mice expressing
hM3Dq in orexin neurons, we could selectively manipulate the activity of orexin
neurons. Pharmacogenetic stimulation of orexin neurons simultaneously increased
locomotive activity, food intake, water intake and the respiratory exchange ratio
(RER). Elevation of blood glucose levels and RER persisted even after locomotion 
and feeding behaviors returned to basal levels. Accordantly, 83% ablation of
orexin neurons resulted in decreased food and water intake, while 70% ablation
had almost no effect on these parameters. Our results indicate that orexin
neurons play an integral role in regulation of both feeding behavior and
metabolism. This regulation is so robust that greater than 80% of orexin neurons 
were ablated before significant changes in feeding behavior emerged.
