A total of 359 patients with acute pneumonia and 152 practically healthy subjects
comprising the control group were examined. Immunofluorescence was used to
investigate nasopharyngeal washings for detecting antigens of influenza and
parainfluenza viruses, respiratory-syncytial virus, adenoviruses, whereas
serological studies according to the hemagglutination delay test with diagnostic 
agents for detecting influenza A1, A2, B, types 1, 2 and 3 parainfluenza, and the
complement fixation test were made to detect antibodies against adenoviruses.
Serological (65%) and immunofluorescence (63%) studies revealed associations of
different viruses: type 3 and 1 parainfluenza, respiratory-syncytial virus (73%) 
with adenoviruses, influenza B, A2, type 2 parainfluenza. Association of
different bacteria was observed in 67% of patients: hemolytic staphylococcus
(65%), hemolytic streptococcus (50%), pneumococci (45%), P. aeruginosa (40%), P. 
mirabilis (35%), E. coli (30%), enterococci (25%). Associations of 3-2 causative 
agents were predominant (53%). Marked decrease in the content of complement and
beta-lysins, elevation of the level of lysozyme were observed in patients with
viral-bacterial and viral pneumonias as compared to the same characteristics in
patients with bacterial pneumonia and in control group subjects.
