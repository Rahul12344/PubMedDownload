In total, 3,013 sera from a representative population sample of the Czech
Republic aged from 1 to 64 years were tested according to the requirements of the
ESEN 2 project using a commercial kit Measles IgG (II) EIA manufactured by Denka 
Seiken, Japan. The highest seropositivity rate and GMT values were found in the
population group aged over 35 years coming into natural contact with the
causative agent. Among the vaccinee population, the best outcomes were achieved
in 2-9-year-olds (seropositivity rate: 94-100%, GMT: 2500-4000 EIA) and
10-14-year-olds (seropositivity rate: 93-97.1%, GMT almost 2000 EIA). The lowest 
seropositivity rate was found in the age group 20 to 24 years, more precisely in 
the 20-year-olds (78.4%), vaccinated with only one dose before the end of the
first year of life. The seropositivity rates and GMT values vary with the
vaccination strategies adopted in different years. The morbidity trend is
supportive of the appropriateness of the vaccination strategy selected.
