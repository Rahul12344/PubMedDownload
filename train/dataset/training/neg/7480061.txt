The psychological impact of warts on patients' lives.

Dudley W.

Warts were for many years associated with witches and magic rituals. Caused by
the human papilloma virus, warts are a common dermatological problem. Warts can
have devastating psychological effects on patients. It is vital that patients are
offered support and advice as well as treatment.
