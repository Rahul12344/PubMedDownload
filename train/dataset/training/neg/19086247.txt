The natural history of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infections results
from interactions of the virus, the host, and multiple cofactors. We studied the 
association between humoral immune response to HPV and smoking in 191 HPV
infected women prospectively. Two follow-up samples (first and last) were
analysed for serum cotinine levels, IgA and IgG antibodies to HPV16 and 18, and
Chlamydia trachomatis using ELISA methods. HPV DNA analyses were also performed, 
and HPV16/18 antibodies were detectable in 23 of 40 (57.5%) HPV DNA-positive
women. We performed age-stratified analyses and found that young smokers were
less likely to develop HPV16/18 antibodies than non-smokers (OR: 0.2, 95% CI
0.0-0.9). Furthermore, they had a significantly decreased tendency of maintaining
constant HPV16/18 IgG antibody positivity by the end of the follow-up (OR: 0.1,
95% CI 0.0-0.8). Smoking did not affect the development of HPV antibody responses
in women over 30 y of age. Our results suggest that smoking may induce impaired
antibody response in HPV16/18-infected young women.
