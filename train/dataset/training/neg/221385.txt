Inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus transformation: evidence for a block between
EBNA production and cell proliferation.

Pope JH, Moss DJ.

Non-adherent lymphocyte populations prepared from donors with previous EBV
infection transformed in the usual way in response to EBV. However,
transformation was completely inhibited in the presence of adult but not fetal
human fibroblasts. Such inhibition was associated with lymphocytes from donors
with prior EBV infection, but not from those without, and there appears to be an 
immunological basis for inhibition. Inhibition was associated with production of 
EBNA and was reversible. Addition of adult fibroblasts to non-adherent
lymphocytes up to 2-4 days after infection with EBV also resulted in inhibition
of transformation. These results are interpreted as indicating that EBV
transformation involves two recognizable phases, with an immunological block
between EBNA production and cell proliferation.
