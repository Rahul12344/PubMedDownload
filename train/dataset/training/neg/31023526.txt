The influenza M2 (22-46) proton channel is therapeutically targetable and a
prototype for proton transport across membranes. Conduction initiation, requiring
a hydronium formed with exceptionally high pKa, remains nebulous. We tackle the
problem by focusing on the dynamic interplay between protein structure and
solvent interface. We identify two packing defects in the protein subunits that
predict exactly the low and high-affinity drug-binding sites. The latter defect
frustrates water coordination, enhancing water basicity and stabilizing the
nearby hydronium that forms upon proton penetration in the channel. Thus, the
trigger of proton conduction is directly related to the high-affinity binding
site. The findings, in quantitative agreement with affinity measurements, are
consistent with the targetable functional nature of protein packing defects.
These findings enable the design of proton-conducting biomimetic materials, where
the epistructure may be engineered to tune the basicity of interfacial water.
