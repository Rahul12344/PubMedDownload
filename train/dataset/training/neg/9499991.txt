Infection by hepatitis C virus is characterized by a high rate of chronicity and 
low viremia. The virus has only been recently identified; it is a positively
stranded RNA virus which shows homology in its genetic organisation with the
pestiviruses and flaviviruses. There is not yet an efficient culture system
available. Evidence indicates that the genetic variability of the HCV genome
might have important clinical implications.
