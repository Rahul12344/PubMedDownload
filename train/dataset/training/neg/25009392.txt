AIM: To evaluate the predictive effect of baseline hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) on response to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-α2b in hepatitis B e
antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis compared the treatment efficacy of
PEG-IFN-α2b alone in 55 HBeAg-positive CHB patients with different baseline HBsAg
levels. Serum HBV DNA load was measured at baseline, and at 12, 24 and 48 wk of
therapy. Virological response was defined as HBV DNA < 1000 IU/mL. Serum HBsAg
titers were quantitatively assayed at baseline, and at 12 and 24 wk.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients had baseline HBsAg > 20 000 IU/mL, 26 patients had
1500-20000 IU/mL, and 11 patients had < 1500 IU/mL. Three (16.7%), 11 (42.3%) and
seven (63.6%) patients in each group achieved a virological response at week 48, 
with a significant difference between groups with baseline HBsAg levels > 20000
or < 20000 IU/mL (P = 0.02). Thirteen patients had an HBsAg decline > 0.5 log10
and 30 patients < 0.5 log10 at week 12; and 6 (46.2%) and 10 (33.3%) in each
group achieved virological response at week 48, with no significant difference
between the two groups (P = 0.502). Eighteen patients had an HBsAg decline > 1.0 
log10 and 30 patients < 1.0 log10 at week 24, and 8 (44.4%) and 11 (36.7%)
achieved a virological response at week 48, with no significant difference
between the two groups (P = 0.762). None of the 16 patients with HBsAg > 20000
IU/mL at week 24 achieved a virological response at week 48.
CONCLUSION: Baseline HBsAg level in combination with HBV DNA may become an
effective predictor for guiding optimal therapy with PEG-IFN-α2b against
HBeAg-positive CHB.
