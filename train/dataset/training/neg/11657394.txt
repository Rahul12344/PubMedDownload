Modified informed consent in a viral seroprevalence study in the Caribbean.

Cox C, Macpherson C.

An unlinked seroprevalence study of HIV and other viruses was conducted on
pregnant women on the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1994. Investigators were
from both the developed world and the Grenadian Ministry of Health (MOH). There
was then no board on Grenada to protect research subjects or review ethical
aspects of studies. Nurses from the MOH were asked to verbally inform their
patients about the study, and request that patients become subjects of the study 
and give blood for screening. If consent was given nurses took blood and
administered a survey about each subjects' knowledge of HIV transmission routes. 
Nurses shared a spoken dialect and cultural heritage with prospective subjects
and were probably more effective than foreign researchers at informing subjects. 
Informed consent was obtained with a simplified consent form supplemented with
conversation with each prospective research subject. Facilitating discussion
between people with common cultural backgrounds helps apply the Western approach 
to informed consent to communites in the developing world. Researchers must
disclose all information to nurses or other mediators, and ensure that nurses
disclose as much information as possible to prospective subjects. So modified,
informed consent maintains respect for persons and becomes applicable and
relevant to various cultures.
