The microvasculature of the cerebral cortex in AIDS brains was investigated by
means of stereology at the light and electron microscopic levels. Stereologic
parameters for microvessels were determined in formalin-fixed autopsy tissue of
24 AIDS patients and of 35 age- and sex-matched controls. At the light
microscopic level these encompassed the measurement of the diameter, volume
fraction, surface area density, and length density; at the electron microscopic
level profile area, perimeter, diameter of capillaries, endothelial cells,
pericytes, and basal lamina as well as the mean thickness of the basal lamina
were measured. In AIDS brains a significant increase in the diameter of cortical 
vessels was noted. The surface area density (Sv) and volume fraction (Vv) of
microvessels were likewise significantly increased in AIDS brains. No changes
were noted for the length density (Lv) which also indicates that no changes in
the number of vessels occur in HIV-1 infection. Ultrastructural thinning of the
basal lamina was a consistent finding. Vacuoles occurred in the basal lamina of
capillaries and increased in number and size in AIDS brains. Using morphometric
methods, significant changes of cortical vessels are detectable at the light and 
electron microscopic level. These changes most probably represent the
morphological substrate of an altered blood-brain-barrier in AIDS brains and may 
account for the reported hypoperfusion demonstrated in SPECT analyses.
