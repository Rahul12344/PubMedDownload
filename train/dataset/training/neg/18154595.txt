Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is acquired during sex, across a mucosal 
membrane. Despite many advances in our understanding of HIV pathogenesis, the
initial events during mucosal transmission have been poorly characterized, and a 
better understanding of these events will probably be a key to the development of
successful microbicide(s) and/or a preventative HIV vaccine. While a vast
majority of mucosal HIV exposures do not result in productive infection, implying
that innate mucosal immune defenses are highly protective, failure of these
mucosal defenses resulted in over 3 million new HIV infections in 2006. We review
recent findings regarding HIV mucosal immunopathogenesis, emphasizing the
importance of innate immunity in natural protection from infection, and examine
how natural or induced perturbations in the mucosal innate system may underpin
HIV transmission. Given the great challenges to the development of HIV
microbicides and vaccines, identification and enhancement of 'natural' innate
immune defenses present attractive avenues for development of safe, non-toxic
microbicides.
