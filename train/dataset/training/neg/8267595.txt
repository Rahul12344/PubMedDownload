To express recombinant hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), we cloned the cDNA by
polymerase chain reaction. Functional recombinant HGF was expressed in insect
cells by a baculovirus expression system. The recombinant HGF is a mixture of a
single-chain precursor and a two-chain heterodimer. Under non-reducing
conditions, they migrate together as a single band with MW 67 kDa on Western
blots. Under reducing conditions, the precursor migrates at 91 kDa, alpha-chain
at 64 kDa and beta-chain at 34 kDa. About 25% of the expressed HGF is in the
expression medium, which does have scatter activity on HepG2 and MDCK cells and
proliferation activity on BN CL.2 cells (a mouse hepatocytes cell line) in a
dose-dependent manner.
