BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model
for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in treatment-naïve patients
receiving oral antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
METHODS: We investigated 2,061 Korean treatment-naïve patients with CHB treated
with entecavir as an initial therapy. A risk score model for HCC development was 
developed based on multivariable Cox regression model in a single center (n=990) 
and was validated using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) in three other centers (n=1,071). The difference of 
HCC development among risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) categorized by
risk score was also investigated.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rates of HCC at 5 years were 11.2% and 8.9% in 
the testing and validation cohorts, respectively. HCC-Risk Estimating Score in
CHB patients Under Entecavir (HCC-RESCUE) is formulated as (age+15×gender
[female=0 / male=1]+23×cirrhosis [absence=0 / presence=1]). The AUROCs at 1 year,
3 years, and 5 years were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.81, respectively, in the validation
cohort. A significant difference of HCC development in each risk group was
determined by the 5-year HCC risk score in the validation cohort (low risk group,
2.1%; intermediate risk group, 9.3%; high risk group, 41.2%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study presents a new risk score model with a good ability to
predict HCC development and determine high risk patients for HCC development
consisting of readily available clinical factors in treatment-naïve CHB patients 
receiving entecavir.
