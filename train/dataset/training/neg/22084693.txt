B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a typical extrahepatic manifestation frequently
associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The mechanism by which HCV
infection leads to lymphoproliferative disorder remains unclear. Our group
established HCV transgenic mice that expressed the full HCV genome in B cells
(RzCD19Cre mice). We observed a 25.0% incidence of diffuse large B cell
non-Hodgkin lymphomas (22.2% in male and 29.6% in female mice) within 600 days of
birth. Interestingly, RzCD19Cre mice with substantially elevated serum-soluble
interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit (sIL-2Rα) levels (>1000 pg/mL) developed B cell 
lymphomas. Another mouse model of lymphoproliferative disorder was established by
persistent expression of HCV structural proteins through disruption of interferon
regulatory factor-1 (irf-1(_/_)/CN2 mice). Irf-1(_/_)/CN2 mice showed extremely
high incidences of lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Moreover, these
mice showed increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, and Bcl-2 as well as
increased Bcl-2 expression, which promoted oncogenic transformation of
lymphocytes.
