OBJECTIVE: Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is characterised by the presence of a
replicative Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the superficial layers of the epithelium.
There is some doubt, however, whether this reflects activation of a latent
infection of the basal epithelial cells. EBV latency is associated with the
expression of the viral gene product EBNA-I and the aim of this study was to
investigate EBNA-I expression in OHL.
METHODS: 22 biopsies of clinically suspicious OHL and three cases of normal
mucosa were available as fresh frozen or paraffin embedded material. EBNA-I was
detected immunocytochemically using a rat monoclonal antibody (IH4-I) following
microwave irradiation. Lytic EBV infection was confirmed by the identification of
the BZLF-I protein.
RESULTS: 16 of the 22 cases displayed focal replicative EBV meeting the criteria 
for OHL, and in 13 of these, EBNA-I expression was restricted to the nuclei of
epithelial cells in the upper layers of the epithelium. EBNA-I expression was
absent from the basal cells in all cases and in the nine BZLF-I negative mucosal 
biopsies.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that lytic EBV infection in OHL is not the
result of activation of a latent infection of basal cells and suggests a role for
EBNA-I, not only in latent EBV infection, but also in virus replication.
