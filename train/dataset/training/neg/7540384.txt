A series of 23 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine derivatives that
were highly potent inhibitors of wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1
strain IIIB (HIV-1/IIIB) replication in CEM cells were evaluated against a panel 
of HIV-1 mutant strains containing the replacement of leucine by isoleucine at
position 100 (100-Leu-->Ile), 103-Lys-->Asn, 106-Val-->Ala, 138-Glu-->Lys,
181-Tyr-->Cys, 181-Tyr-->Ile, or 188-Tyr-->His in their reverse transcriptase
(RT). A different structure-antiviral activity relationship was found, depending 
on the nature of the mutated amino acid in the HIV-1 RT. The results show that
5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil,
5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylphenylthio)uracil, and
5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylphenylthio)-2-thiouracil remain active
against the majority of viruses containing single mutations which confer
resistance to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors.
