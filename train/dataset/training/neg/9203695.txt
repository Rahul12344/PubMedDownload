In 1989, a localized outbreak of 10 cases of poliomyelitis occurred in Saudi
Arabia. Wild poliovirus type 1 was isolated from 5 patients. To determine the
patterns of poliovirus circulation, partial nucleotide sequences of the
poliovirus isolates were compared. These isolates were remarkably diverse. Two
isolates were closely related to each other and to viruses isolated during the
1988 epidemic in Oman. Two other isolates were very similar to viruses found in
Egypt. The fifth isolate was distantly related to the latter pair. The molecular 
data suggest that the 10 cases represented three separate outbreaks. The
virologic findings underscore the potential for Saudi Arabia, which receives
millions of guest workers and their families each year from countries in which
polio is endemic, to be exposed to frequent importations of wild polioviruses. To
restrict the circulation of imported polioviruses, Saudi Arabia must maintain
high population immunity to poliovirus in all geopolitical divisions.
