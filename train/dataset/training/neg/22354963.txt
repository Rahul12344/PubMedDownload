Amyloid fibrils contained in semen, known as SEVI, or semen-derived enhancer of
viral infection, have been shown to increase the infectivity of HIV dramatically.
However, previous work with these fibrils has suggested that extensive time and
nonphysiologic levels of agitation are necessary to induce amyloid formation from
the precursor peptide (a proteolytic cleavage product of prostatic acid
phosphatase, PAP(248-286)). Here, we show that fibril formation by PAP(248-286)
is accelerated dramatically in the presence of seminal plasma (SP) and that
agitation is not required for fibrillization in this setting. Analysis of the
effects of specific SP components on fibril formation by PAP(248-286) revealed
that this effect is primarily due to the anionic buffer components of SP (notably
inorganic phosphate and sodium bicarbonate). Divalent cations present in SP had
little effect on the kinetics of fibril formation, but physiologic levels of
Zn(2+) strongly protected SEVI fibrils from degradation by seminal proteases.
Taken together, these data suggest that in the in vivo environment, PAP(248-286) 
is likely to form fibrils efficiently, thus providing an explanation for the
presence of SEVI in human semen.
