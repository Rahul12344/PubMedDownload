To determine the potential for sexual transmission of the hepatitis C virus
(HCV), we specifically studied a cohort of 42 young adults (median age, 39 yr)
with chronic HCV infection and their stable sexual partners. All HCV assays were 
supplemented with the four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay, and 39 of 42
partners were tested for HCV RNA by the nested polymerase chain reaction. Ninety 
percent of the partners reported frequent and unprotected sexual intercourse with
the index patients. Two of 42 partners tested positive for the anti-HCV antibody 
and both were HCV RNA positive; one had independent risk factors for viral
hepatitis. Therefore, one of 41 partners, (2.4%; 95% CI, 0.6-12.9%) without
independent risk factors for HCV was anti-HCV positive. This woman was one of
five partners (20%; 95% CI, 1-66%) who reported frequent razor-sharing with the
index patient. The partner frequently sustained skin lacerations, with bleeding, 
secondary to this shared razor blade. We conclude that heterosexual transmission 
of hepatitis C is extremely uncommon, despite frequent and unprotected sexual
intercourse.
