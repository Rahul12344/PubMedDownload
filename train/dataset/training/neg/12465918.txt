[reaction: see text] A new strategy directed toward the total synthesis of
stachyflin, a potent and novel anti-influenza A virus agent isolated from a
microorganism, has been presented through the enantioselective synthesis of the
tetracyclic core structure. The synthetic method features a BF(3) x
Et(2)O-induced domino epoxide-opening/rearrangement/cyclization reaction as the
key step.
