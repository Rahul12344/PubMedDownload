In 54 patients with cHCV infection, peripheral immune responsiveness and soluble 
mediator release were evaluated. Results demonstrate that in these patients
phagocytosis and killing capacities exerted by polymorphonuclear cells and
monocytes were profoundly depressed. At the same time, absolute numbers of CD3+, 
CD8+ and CD16+ cells were reduced, while the CD4(+)-CD8+ dependent antibacterial 
activity was also impaired. With special reference to soluble mediators, elevated
amounts of both soluble interleukin-2 receptor and soluble intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 were detected in sera of patients. By contrast, serum levels of tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha were within normal ranges, whereas interferon-gamma serum
concentrations were decreased. Of note, in 18.5% of cHCV patients circulating
levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were detected by means of Limulus
assay. In the Limulus+subset of patients, absolute numbers of CD14+ cells were
reduced in a significant manner, this implying a putative monocyte-LPS
interaction. In conclusion, the overall results indicate a condition of
peripheral immune depression in cHCV patients with an exaggerated shedding of
various mediators endowed with noxious effects for the host.
