HIV infection is a chronic illness that affects individuals of all ages. The
pulmonary system is the most common body system affected by the disease.
Management of these complications has improved over the years and has resulted in
a decline in mortality. Critical care nurses should understand the complications 
that develop and be knowledgeable about the management to improve the patient's
clinical outcomes. Assessment for complications must begin once an individual is 
diagnosed as being infected with HIV and continue throughout the course of the
disease. Prevention is the key to limiting respiratory complications and thus
improving survival rates.
