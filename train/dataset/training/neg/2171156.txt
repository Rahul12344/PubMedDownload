The article reviews present knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in 
herpes virus latency. The work on herpes virus latency has created a foundation
for much of our knowledge about viral latency in general. Herpes simplex virus is
perhaps best known in this respect. This virus resides latently in sensory
ganglia. No herpes simplex-specific proteins have been found, but a specific RNA 
transcript has been identified. In varicella-zoster virus latency several
latency-associated transcripts are known and, as for herpes simplex virus,
sensory ganglia harbour the latent infection. There is still some dispute as to
whether Epstein-Barr virus is truly latent or not. However, evidence for specific
proteins associated with latency is accumulating. Little is known about
cytomegalovirus latency.
