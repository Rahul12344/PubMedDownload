PURPOSE: Use of coital-dependent products to prevent HIV-1 transmission has
resulted in mixed success. We hypothesize that incorporation of antiviral drug
candidates into a novel controlled delivery system will prolong their activity,
making their use coital independent, thus increasing their chance of prophylactic
success.
METHODS: Tenofovir, emtricitabine, and C5A peptide HIV microbicides were
mechanically incorporated into matrices comprising a series of subliming solids. 
Matrix sublimation rates and drug release rates were measured in three in vitro
and one in vivo environments intended to model human vaginal interior. Antiviral 
activity studies evaluating matrix incorporated microbicides were performed using
in vitro cell cultures and human ectocervical explants.
RESULTS: Drug release rates were identical to matrix sublimation rates, and were 
zero order. Differences in matrix material sublimation enthalpies determined drug
release and matrix erosion rates in a thermodynamically definable manner, in
vitro and in vivo. Durations of release ranging from several days to several
months were readily achieved. Prolonged duration of anti HIV-1 activity was shown
for matrix incorporated microbicides, using ectocervical explant and cell culture
models of HIV-1 infection.
CONCLUSION: Subliming solid matrices show promise as a delivery system providing 
multi month intravaginal release of a wide range of HIV-1 microbicides.
