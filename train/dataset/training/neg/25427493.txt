As a potential pandemic threat to human health, there has been an urgent need for
rapid, sensitive, simpler and less expensive detection method for the highly
pathogenic influenza A virus. For this purpose, Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM)
and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensors have been developed for the
recognition of hemagglutinin (HA) which is a major protein of influenza A virus. 
4-Aminophenyl boronic acid (4-APBA) has been synthesized and used as a new ligand
for binding of sialic acid (SA) via boronic acid-sugar interaction. SA has an
important role in binding of HA. QCM and SPR sensor surfaces have been modified
with thiol groups and then 4-APBA and SA have been immobilized on sensor
surfaces, respectively. Sensor surfaces have been screened with AFM and used for 
the determination of HA from aqueous solution. The selective recognition of the
QCM and SPR sensors toward Concanavalin A has been reported in this work. Also,
the binding capacity and detection limits of QCM and SPR sensors have been
calculated and detection limits were found to be 4.7 × 10(-2) μM, (0.26 μg
ml(-1)) and 1.28 × 10(-1) μM, (0.72 μg ml(-1)) in the 95% confidence interval,
respectively.
