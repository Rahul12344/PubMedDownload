This study aimed to explore the contribution of high-mannose glycans in the
masking of conserved V3 crown (GPG) and V2i epitopes on the hypervariable loops
of most exposed distal surface of HIV-1 Env. Using lectins specific to Manα1-2Man
residue containing Man6-9GlcNAc2 glycans extensively decorating HIV-1 Env, we
found that Manα1-2Man-binding lectins enhance the exposure of these partially and
transiently exposed epitopes and consequentially increase the neutralization
strength of antibodies against these epitopes.
