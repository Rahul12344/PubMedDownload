The clinical and laboratory data regarding the presence of serum markers of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) were studied in a group of patients with necrotizing
vasculitis. A high incidence of skin and articular alterations, of
cryoglobulinemia and rheumatoid factor, was observed in HBsAg carriers. The
potential role of HBV in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis is discussed.
