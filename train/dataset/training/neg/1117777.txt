Infections in the immunosuppressed patient.

O'Loughlin JM.

Infections in the immunosuppressed cancer patient are caused by a wide variety of
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa; many of these in the normal individual
are saprophytes but will cause disease in the immunosuppressed patient, often
with treatment failure. Patterns of infection are recognized, and this should
enable the physician to plan a meaningful course of action when infection occurs 
in the compromised host. Obviously, it would be much better to prevent rather
than have to treat infection in these immunosuppressed patients. Ideally, in the 
future, it is hoped that drugs which have less suppressive effect on defense
mechanisms will provide a partial solution to the problem of infection in the
immunosuppressed patient.
