The causative agent of murine AIDS (MAIDS) is the defective murine leukemia virus
BM5d, that requires the replication-competent ecotropic MuLV (BM5e) helper virus.
We developed a competitive quantitative PCR method including specific internal
standards to quantify the expression of BM5d in the spleen of infected mice and
to characterize BM5d expression kinetics following experimental infection.
Specimen RNA was reverse-transcribed and co-amplified with a competitive template
containing a gag sequence specific for BM5d that can be discriminated from that
corresponding to wild-type cDNA by the presence of a unique restriction site,
Bg/II. PCR products were quantified by means of densitometric analysis after
ethidium bromide staining of gels. To standardise the RNA extraction and reverse 
transcription steps, the amount of defective-virus mRNA was compared to a
constant copy number of murine beta actin mRNA. LP-BM5 production was measured in
the spleen of infected mice. Defective gag mRNA production was compared to that
of the ecotropic virus. The mRNA level of the defective virus and the titre of
replicative virus increased with the duration of infection, and the amount of
defective virus mRNA correlated with the titre of replicating virus.
