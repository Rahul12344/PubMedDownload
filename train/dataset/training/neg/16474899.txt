We engineered an artificial beta cell line that produces an up-regulation of
insulin in response to dexamethasone, and a down-regulation in response to
insulin. A regulatory secretion system was devised by placing proinsulin cDNA
containing genetically engineered furin endoprotease cleavage sites and a
regulatory promoter for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and an insulin
expressing retrovirus vector (pN-PEPCK-mINS) was constructed and transfected into
Hepa1-6 cells. The levels of insulin in culture medium and expression of insulin 
gene was estimated by radioimmunoassay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The clone (Hepa1-6/INS21), which secreted the
highest level of insulin (10.79 microIU/106 cells per day), was selected for the 
regulation experiment. Compared with the non-treated Hepa1-6/INS21 cells, insulin
production was augmented 3.6-fold by the addition of 10-7 M of dexamethasone.
Addition of exogenous insulin to the culture medium decreased insulin mRNA
expression remarkably on RT-PCR results, while dexamethasone increased insulin
gene expression at the transcriptional level. The data indicated that genetically
engineered Hepa1-6 cells could synthesize process and secrete insulin in a
physiological manner.
