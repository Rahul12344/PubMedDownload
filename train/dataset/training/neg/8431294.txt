Expression of foreign proteins in the baculovirus-insect cell expression system
has been limited by difficulties in rapid identification and purification of
recombinant virus. Although the process of identifying recombinant virus has been
greatly facilitated by the introduction of vectors that lead to insect cell
co-expression of beta-galactosidase with foreign genes of interest, isolation of 
pure recombinant virus using plaque purification may still take several weeks to 
months to accomplish. Using a fluorescent beta-galactosidase substrate, we have
established that insect cells harboring recombinant virus can be rapidly isolated
using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Pure recombinant virus can then be
readily obtained using this cellular fraction, with a pure viral culture
generally obtained within 2-3 weeks of insect cell transfection.
