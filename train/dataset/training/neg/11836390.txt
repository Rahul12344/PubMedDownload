We demonstrate that the S4 genome segment of baboon reovirus (BRV) contains two
sequential partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), both of which are
functional in vitro and in virus-infected cells. The 15-kDa gene product (p15) of
the 5"-proximal ORF induces efficient cell-cell fusion when expressed by itself
in transfected cells, suggesting that p15 is the only viral protein required for 
induction of syncytium formation by BRV. The p15 protein is a small, hydrophobic,
basic, integral membrane protein, properties shared with the p10
fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins encoded by avian reovirus
and Nelson Bay reovirus. As with p10, the BRV p15 protein is also a nonstructural
protein and, therefore, is not involved in virus entry. Sequence analysis
indicates that p15 shares no significant sequence similarity with the p10 FAST
proteins and contains a unique repertoire and arrangement of sequence-predicted
structural and functional motifs. These motifs include a functional N-terminal
myristylation consensus sequence, an N-proximal proline-rich motif, two potential
transmembrane domains, and an intervening polybasic region. The unique structural
properties of p15 suggest that this protein is a novel member of the new family
of FAST proteins.
