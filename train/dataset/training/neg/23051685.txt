BACKGROUND: Epinotia aporema (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is an important pest of
legume crops in South America. Epinotia aporema granulovirus (EpapGV) is a
baculovirus that causes a polyorganotropic infection in the host larva. Its high 
pathogenicity and host specificity make EpapGV an excellent candidate to be used 
as a biological control agent.
RESULTS: The genome of Epinotia aporema granulovirus (EpapGV) was sequenced and
analyzed. Its circular double-stranded DNA genome is 119,082 bp in length and
codes for 133 putative genes. It contains the 31 baculovirus core genes and a set
of 19 genes that are GV exclusive. Seventeen ORFs were unique to EpapGV in
comparison with other baculoviruses. Of these, 16 found no homologues in GenBank,
and one encoded a thymidylate kinase. Analysis of nucleotide sequence repeats
revealed the presence of 16 homologous regions (hrs) interspersed throughout the 
genome. Each hr was characterized by the presence of 1 to 3 clustered imperfect
palindromes which are similar to previously described palindromes of
tortricid-specific GVs. Also, one of the hrs (hr4) has flanking sequences
suggestive of a putative non-hr ori. Interestingly, two more complex hrs were
found in opposite loci, dividing the circular dsDNA genome in two halves. Gene
synteny maps showed the great colinearity of sequenced GVs, being EpapGV the most
dissimilar as it has a 20 kb-long gene block inversion. Phylogenetic study
performed with 31 core genes of 58 baculoviral genomes suggests that EpapGV is
the baculovirus isolate closest to the putative common ancestor of tortricid
specific betabaculoviruses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study, along with previous characterization of EpapGV
infection, is useful for the better understanding of the pathology caused by this
virus and its potential utilization as a bioinsecticide.
