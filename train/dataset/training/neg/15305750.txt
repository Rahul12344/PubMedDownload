Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSVs) are classified
into 2 distinct genotypes: the North American type and the European type. The
Japanese PRRSVs were genotyped by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
using the reported primer pairs that were either reactive to both types, specific
to the North American type or specific to the European type. All the PRRSV
genomes from 66 tissue homogenates or sera and 55 infectious viruses were of the 
North American type, whereas no European-type viral genome was detected. Two PCR 
primers specific to the North American type showed different detection
efficiency. Half of the tissue samples and 15% of the infectious viruses were not
detected with one primer pair, although all of them were detected with the other 
primer pair. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the forward-and reverse
primer-binding sites of the nonreactive viruses indicated that all these viruses 
had nucleotide mismatches within the 4 bases corresponding to the 3' end of the
reverse primer. These mismatches appeared to be responsible for the nonreactivity
of the former primers to these viruses.
