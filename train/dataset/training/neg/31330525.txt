The programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligands (PD-1/PD-Ls) axis is a 
potential immune escape mechanism of cancers. However, data on the PD-1/PD-Ls
pathway in EBV-associated extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) and
its clinical implication are limited. Herein, we characterized PD-1/PD-L
expression and its prognosis relevance in 49 ENKTL patients in Thailand. PD-L1
was expressed frequently on both lymphoma cells (61.2%) and stroma (77.5%),
whereas PD-L2 expression was more common on lymphoma (63.2%) than stromal cells. 
PD-1 was positive in 20.5% of stroma, but undetectable on lymphoma cells. There
was no association between baseline clinical characteristics and the expression
PD-1/PD-Ls. The survival of patients with PD-Ls on tumor cells was poor. For
PD-L1-positive versus negative cases, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was
42.2 versus 71.8% (p = 0.03) and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 45.4 versus
78.9% (p = 0.02), respectively. Comparing between patients with PD-L2-positive
and PD-L2-negative lymphoma, the 2-year EFS was 37.1 versus 82.4% (p = 0.02) and 
2-year OS was 45.2 versus 82.4% (p = 0.03), respectively. Neither PD-1 nor PD-Ls 
expression in the stroma predicted outcomes. In conclusion, PD-Ls were frequently
expressed on ENKTL cells and associated with inferior outcomes. Therefore, PD-Ls 
are potential prognostic biomarkers and the roles of immune checkpoint blockade
therapy in ENKTL deserve further investigation.
