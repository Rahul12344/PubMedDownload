Induction of thymidine kinase activity by viruses with group B DNA genomes:
bovine cytomegalovirus (bovine herpesvirus 4).

Kit S, Kit M, Ichimura H, Crandell R, McConnell S.

The bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BHV-4) group has a slow replication cycle, a
narrow host range, and cytopathogenic effects characteristic of cytomegaloviruses
(CMV), but a Group B genome structure similar to that of lymphotropic Herpesvirus
saimiri (HVS). Reference BHV-4 strain DN599 and BHV-4 strains N124 and FHV-2
induced in the cytosol fraction of thymidine kinase-negative (TK-) rabbit skin
(RAB-BU) cell mutants a novel TK activity. The BHV-4-induced thymidine kinase
(TK) differed from the principal cytosol TK of mock-infected cells in PAGE
mobility (Rm) under non-denaturing conditions and in the capacity to efficiently 
substitute CTP for ATP as a phosphate donor. The BHV-4 thymidine phosphorylating 
activity could also be distinguished from many common herpesvirus-induced TKs
because it lacked iododeoxycytidine phosphorylating activity. Iododeoxyuridine,
trifluorothymidine and bromovinyldeoxyuridine inhibited [3H]thymidine (0.01 mM)
phosphorylation by the BHV-4 enzyme in a dose-dependent manner, but
arabinosylthymine and 2'-fluoro-5-methyl-arabinosyluracil (FMAU) were poor
inhibitors of [3H]thymidine phosphorylation, and acyclovir and
(dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG) did not inhibit at all at 60 and 40
times the concentrations of [3H]thymidine, respectively.
