Ability of a cocktail of five lytic vibriophages to combatting Vibrio cholerae O1
infection in rabbit model was examined. In one group, rabbits were administered 1
× 10(8) plaque forming unit of phage cocktail 6 and 12 h prior to the
administration of V. cholerae O1, while in the other group, same procedure was
applied 6 and 12 h post infection. It was observed that oral administration of
the phage cocktail after oral bacterial challenge lowered the shedding of
bacteria significantly (p < 0.01). In contrast phage treatment prior to bacterial
challenge had no such effect (p > 0.05). Results suggest that oral administration
of phage subsequent to V. cholerae challenge could provide a possible means of
combatting V. cholerae infection.
