Neurotropin, a non-proteinaceous extract from the inflamed dermis of rabbits
inoculated with vaccinia virus, was administered for 8 weeks to rats with
streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The physiological and biochemical changes of the
nerves were studied as well as ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Neurotropin
improved the caudal motor nerve conduction velocity, R-R variability, sciatic
nerve blood flow, and platelet hyperaggregability in diabetic rats, despite
having no effect on sorbitol and fructose accumulation or myoinositol depletion
in the sciatic nerve. The correlation between nerve conduction velocity, R-R
variability, nerve blood flow, and platelet aggregation were significant between 
each two parameters (p < 0.0001). Thus, the mechanism of action of neurotropin
differed from that of aldose reductase inhibitors. These findings suggest that
vascular factors may play an important role in the development of diabetic
neuropathy, and that neurotropin may be useful for the treatment of this
condition.
