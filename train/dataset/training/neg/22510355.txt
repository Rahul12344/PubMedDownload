OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of maraviroc with other antiretrovirals in
patients with HIV-1 coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus 
(HCV).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, noncomparative, open-label, expanded access
program (EAP) initiated in February 2007. Patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 and
HIV-1 RNA â‰¥ 1000 copies/mL on their current treatment received maraviroc 300 mg
(150 mg with protease inhibitors) twice daily with optimized background therapy
(OBT), which could include the newer agents raltegravir, etravirine, and
darunavir. The adverse event (AE) profile was compared with the active and
placebo arms of the maraviroc phase III clinical trials MOTIVATE 1 and 2, where
the OBT did not include these agents.
RESULTS: A total of 1,032 patients were enrolled: 51 HIV/HBV coinfected; 149
HIV/HCV coinfected, 9 HIV/HBV/HCV coinfected, and 823 HIV-1 monoinfected. Most
(76%) received at least 1 newer agent. Overall AE frequency was comparable across
coinfection groups (63%-72%). Hepatobiliary events were more common in HIV/HCV
coinfection than in HIV monoinfection or HIV/HBV coinfection (10.0, 4.8, and 3.1 
per 100 patient-years, respectively). Across all coinfection groups, there was a 
trend toward lower exposure-adjusted rates of serious and hepatobiliary AEs in
the EAP than in the MOTIVATE studies. Grade 3/4 transaminase elevations in
patients receiving maraviroc in the EAP and MOTIVATE were comparable with those
seen in the MOTIVATE placebo arm.
CONCLUSION: Maraviroc plus an OBT did not increase the incidence of AEs or severe
laboratory liver abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients coinfected with HBV or 
HCV.
