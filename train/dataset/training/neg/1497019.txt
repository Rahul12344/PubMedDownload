status to patients.

Since informed consent became legally required in the therapeutic setting, the
risks physicians were to disclose have been limited to the risks of particular
procedures. Two recent court decisions in which disclosure of surgeons'
alcoholism and positive human immunodeficiency virus status was required may
begin to erode that limit. The grounds for this expansion of disclosure
requirements were inherent in the 20-year-old "materiality" standard for
disclosure; nevertheless, the change they signal is profound. These cases may
signal a trend that, in the long term, could result in a shift in
physician-patient communication and a significant loss of privacy for physicians.
