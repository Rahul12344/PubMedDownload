OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence rate of perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection and to describe the clinical presentation of this infection in
non-transfused term infants attended at a general hospital, in Ribeirão Preto,
SP, Brazil. POPULATION AND METHODS: Thirty four infants free of CMV infection at 
birth were followed up during the first 4 months of life. Diagnosis of perinatal 
CMV infection was established by isolating the virus in tissue culture or by
polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification (PCR) in urine samples. RESULTS: A
38.2% (13/34) incidence rate of perinatal CMV infection was detected, and only 3 
of the infected infants were symptomatic (respiratory tract symptoms in one
infant and splenomegaly in two). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a high
incidence rate of perinatal CMV infection in the studied infants. Clinical
symptoms were present in 23% of these patients, stimulating the investigation of 
this agent as a cause of pneumonitis and splenomegaly.
