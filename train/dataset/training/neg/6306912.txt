Two types of glycoprotein precursors are produced by the simian rotavirus SA11.

Ericson BL, Graham DY, Mason BB, Hanssen HH, Estes MK.

The rotavirus genome codes for two glycoproteins: an outer capsid structural
glycoprotein (VP7, apparent molecular weight 38,000 (38K)) and a nonstructural
glycoprotein (NS28K). The synthesis of these glycoproteins was analyzed in
infected cells and in a cell-free system derived from rabbit reticulocyte lysates
supplemented with dog pancreatic microsomes. The data showed a 37K product
synthesized in the cell-free system is the precursor to the 38K glycoprotein and 
that the 37K polypeptide contains a cleavable signal sequence (apparent molecular
weight 1.5K). The 37K polypeptide was glycosylated in vitro in the presence of
microsomal membranes to a polypeptide of 38K that was immunoprecipitated by
monospecific antiserum to VP7. Endo H digestion of the 38K polypeptides from
either infected cells or the cell-free system produced polypeptides of identical 
molecular weight, 35.5K (the glycoprotein precursor lacking the signal sequence).
These results were confirmed by comparative studies with a variant of SA11 that
is defective in glycosylation of VP7. Similar experiments with the 20K precursor 
to the 29K nonstructural glycoprotein showed the 20K polypeptide contains a
noncleavable signal sequence. Both glycoproteins were inserted into microsomal
membranes and were processed via oligosaccharide trimming.
