The case of a Chinese patient with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1
(HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), who showed
typical neurological symptoms of the disease, is reported here. Since the
presence of anti-HTLV-1 antibody was not investigated, this patient's diagnosis
of HAM/TSP was delayed for 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple 
spotty lesions in the cervical spinal cord, probably reflecting pathological
changes known as perivascular lymphocytic infiltrations of the spinal cord. As
this is the first case report of a HAM/TSP patient in China, it is suggested that
serological testing for HTLV-1 should be considered in patients with spastic
paraparesis even in areas that are non-endemic for HTLV-1.
