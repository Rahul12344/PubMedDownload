Routine EEG investigations and observance of discrete neurological and
psychological symptoms in 13 children in the acute phase of Henoch-Schoenlein
purpura showed that involvement of the central nervous system in this disease is 
the rule rather than the exception. Capillary resistance was reduced in 51 out of
76 investigated children. On the other hand a reduction in factor XIII activity
was much less commonly found (n =6). Immune complex determination in 28 children,
together with antibody studies, showed that in 13 of them the Henoch-Schoenlein
purpura was triggered off by an influenza-A-virus infection of the upper
respiratory tract. Two thirds of the patients had markedly raised levels of total
serum complement which fell weeks within several.
