In April 2014 an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 North American
genetic lineage was diagnosed in a commercial quail operation in Stanislaus
County, California. Sudden increase in mortality prompted the submission of 20
Japanese quail hens (Coturnix c. japonica) to the California Animal Health and
Food Safety Laboratory, Turlock Branch. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs tested
positive for influenza A virus H5N8 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction. The virus was subsequently isolated. In vivo assay and sequencing
of the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site classified the virus as a North
American genetic lineage of low pathogenicity for chickens. Following the
diagnosis, a rapid and coordinated response took place to contain the outbreak.
The affected premise was depopulated, cleaned, and disinfected. Three areas from 
the affected premises-a 3 kilometer (km) radius (High Risk Zone), a 3-10 km area 
(Buffer Zone), and a 10-20 km (Surveillance Zone)-were established for avian
influenza testing of commercial and noncommercial poultry operations.
Surveillance testing and rapid control measures were successful in the control
and eradication of the outbreak and revealed no area of spread of the virus from 
the index flock. This report describes the history, diagnosis, surveillance, and 
control measures applied to manage this outbreak.
