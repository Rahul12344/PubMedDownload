The complete nucleotide sequence of the satellite virus of St. Augustine decline 
virus (sSADV) has been determined. It comprises 824 nucleotides and contains a
single, large open reading frame that corresponds to the coat protein of the
satellite virus, as confirmed by direct amino acid sequencing. The genome
contains two other potential open reading frames, similar to the organization of 
satellite Panicum mosaic virus (sPMV). These two satellite viruses share
significant sequence homology at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels;
there are 36 nucleotide differences, resulting in five amino acid changes. Other 
than the close homology with sPMV, there is no homology with the known satellite 
viruses at the nucleotide or amino acid level, while there is some similarity in 
the hydropathy profiles of the coat proteins of these viruses.
