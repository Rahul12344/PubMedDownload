The human T-cell leukemia virus type I rex gene product plays a critical role in 
the expression of the retroviral structural proteins Gag and Env from
incompletely spliced mRNAs. Rex protein acts through a cis element (rex-response 
element [RxRE]) which is located in the U3/R region of the 3' long terminal
repeat and is present on all human T-cell leukemia virus type I-specific mRNAs.
Two domains of the predicted secondary structure of the RxRE are crucially
important for Rex action in vivo as measured by two assay systems. In vitro
studies using highly purified recombinant Rex protein revealed a specific and
direct interaction with radiolabeled RxRE sequences. The correlation between our 
in vivo results and the direct binding of Rex protein to mutant and wild-type
RxRE sequences supports both the existence of the predicted secondary structure
and the importance of this direct interaction with the cis-acting RNA sequence
for Rex function in vivo.
