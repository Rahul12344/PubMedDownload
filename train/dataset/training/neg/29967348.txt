Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with congenital defects and pregnancy
loss. Here, we found that 26% of nonhuman primates infected with Asian/American
ZIKV in early gestation experienced fetal demise later in pregnancy despite
showing few clinical signs of infection. Pregnancy loss due to asymptomatic ZIKV 
infection may therefore be a common but under-recognized adverse outcome related 
to maternal ZIKV infection.
