the cell DNA in cervical dysplasia.

The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 DNA in biopsies from
precancerous lesions and from early lesions of human cervical cancer, and the
integration of virus DNA into host cell DNA were analysed by dot blot and
Southern blot hybridizations. HPV 16 DNA was detected in 23% of mild dysplasias, 
32% of moderate dysplasias, 55% of severe dysplasias and 62% of carcinomas in
situ by dot blot hybridization. Digestion of the DNA with restriction enzymes
PstI and BamHI followed by Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of some
typical restriction fragments of HPV 16 DNA in most virus-positive samples. In
addition, we detected submolar fragments which might represent virus-cell
junction sequences in 86% of dysplasias, suggesting that the integration of HPV
16 DNA could occur in the precancerous stage.
