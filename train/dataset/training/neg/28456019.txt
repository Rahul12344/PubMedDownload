Bacteriophage SP6 exhibits dual-host adsorption specificity. The SP6 tailspikes
are recognized as important in host range determination but the mechanisms
underlying dual host specificity are unknown. Cryo-electron tomography and
sub-tomogram classification were used to analyze the SP6 virion with a particular
focus on the interaction of tailspikes with host membranes. The SP6 tail is
surrounded by six V-shaped structures that interconnect in forming a
hand-over-hand hexameric garland. Each V-shaped structure consists of two
trimeric tailspike proteins: gp46 and gp47, connected through the adaptor protein
gp37. SP6 infection of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Newport
results in distinguishable changes in tailspike orientation, providing the first 
direct demonstration how tailspikes can confer dual host adsorption specificity. 
SP6 also infects S. Typhimurium strains lacking O antigen; in these infections
tailspikes have no apparent specific role and the phage tail must therefore
interact with a distinct host receptor to allow infection.
