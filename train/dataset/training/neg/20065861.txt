BACKGROUND: Detectable HIV-1 RNA at delivery is the strongest predictor of
mother-to-child transmission. The risk factors for detectable HIV, including type
of regimen, are unknown. We evaluated factors, including highly active
antiretroviral (HAART) regimen, associated with detectable HIV-1 RNA at delivery 
in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS).
METHODS: Data from 630 HIV-1-infected women who enrolled from 1998 to 2005 and
received HAART during pregnancy were analyzed. Multivariable analyses examined
associations between regimens, demographic factors, and detectable HIV-1 RNA
(>400 copies/milliliter) at delivery.
RESULTS: Overall, 32% of the women in the cohort had detectable HIV-1 RNA at
delivery. Among the subset of 364 HAART-experienced women, a lower CD4 cell count
at enrollment [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.20 per 100 cells/microL, confidence 
interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.37] and higher HIV-1 RNA at enrollment (AOR = 1.52 per
log10 copies/milliliter, CI 1.32 to 1.75) were significantly associated with
detectable HIV-1 RNA levels at delivery. For the 266 HAART-naive women, both
lower CD4 cell count at enrollment (AOR = 1.24 per 100 cells/microL, CI 1.05 to
1.48) and higher HIV-1 RNA at enrollment (AOR = 1.35 per log10 copies/milliliter,
CI 1.12 to 1.63) were associated with detectable HIV-1 RNA at delivery. In
addition, age at delivery (AOR = 0.92 per 10 years older, CI 0.86 to 0.99) and
maternal illicit drug use (AOR = 3.15, CI 1.34 to 7.41) were significantly
associated with detectable HIV-1 RNA at delivery among HAART-naive women. Type of
HAART regimen was not significant in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of viral suppression at delivery was common in the WITS cohort,
but differences by antiretroviral regimen were not identified. Despite a
transmission rate below 1% in the last 5 years of the WITS cohort, improved
measures to maximize HIV-1 RNA suppression at term among high-risk women are
warranted.
