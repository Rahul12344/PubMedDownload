People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for blood-borne pathogens
transmitted during the sharing of contaminated injection equipment, particularly 
hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV prevalence is influenced by a complex interplay of
drug-use behaviors, social networks, and geography, as well as the availability
of interventions, such as needle exchange programs. To adequately address this
complexity in HCV epidemic forecasting, we have developed a computational model, 
the Agent-based Pathogen Kinetics model (APK). APK simulates the PWID population 
in metropolitan Chicago, including the social interactions that result in HCV
infection. We used multiple empirical data sources on Chicago PWID to build a
spatial distribution of an in silico PWID population and modeled networks among
the PWID by considering the geography of the city and its suburbs. APK was
validated against 2012 empirical data (the latest available) and shown to agree
with network and epidemiological surveys to within 1%. For the period 2010-2020, 
APK forecasts a decline in HCV prevalence of 0.8% per year from 44(± 2)% to 36(± 
5)%, although some sub-populations would continue to have relatively high
prevalence, including Non-Hispanic Blacks, 48(± 5)%. The rate of decline will be 
lowest in Non-Hispanic Whites and we find, in a reversal of historical trends,
that incidence among non-Hispanic Whites would exceed incidence among
Non-Hispanic Blacks (0.66 per 100 per years vs 0.17 per 100 person years). APK
also forecasts an increase in PWID mean age from 35(± 1) to 40(± 2) with a
corresponding increase from 59(± 2)% to 80(± 6)% in the proportion of the
population >30 years old. Our studies highlight the importance of analyzing
subpopulations in disease predictions, the utility of computer simulation for
analyzing demographic and health trends among PWID and serve as a tool for
guiding intervention and prevention strategies in Chicago, and other major
cities.
