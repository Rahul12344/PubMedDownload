In the course of viral infection, the immune system exploits only a fraction of
the available CTL repertoire and focuses on a few of a myriad of potentially
antigenic peptides. This phenomenon, known as immunodominance, depends on a
number of factors, including antigen processing and transport, MHC binding,
competition for antigen-presenting cells, availability of the CD8 T cell
repertoire and other mechanisms that function largely by restricting the immune
response. Here we elucidate a novel mechanism that increases the immunodominance 
of the epitope rather by enhancing the immune response. Using a peptide-specific 
MHC-restricted mAb and functional assays of CTL activation, we show that T cells 
with high avidity for the immunodominant, H-2D(d) restricted, P18-I10 epitope
expand rapidly following immunization, and this expansion in turn determines the 
level of the P18-I10 epitope immunodominance. This proliferation has little
dependence on the number of MHC-peptide complexes. Since most self-reactive T
cells of high avidity are depleted in the thymus, the selection of immunodominant
epitopes based on the expansion of high-avidity T cells in the periphery reduces 
the potential for autoimmunity.
