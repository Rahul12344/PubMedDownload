Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of PCR-amplified DNA and 
subsequent DNA sequencing of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoprotein B (gB)
gene were applied to identify known HCMV strains and to detect new virus
variants. 61 HCMV PCR positive patients were studied out of a cohort of 410
patients after liver transplantation (LTX). SSCP was able to distinguish between 
strains Davis, AD169, and Towne, and in addition could identify five new virus
variants (Berlin B, C, E, F, and H). Their frequency, gB and gH types were
determined. Simultaneous infections with two or three strains or variants, as
well as a switch from one virus to another virus were observed during long-term
follow-up. No correlation between the occurrence of certain virus strains or gB
types and defined clinical manifestations of HCMV infection after LTX was drawn.
