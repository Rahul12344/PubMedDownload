The binding of insulin to mouse leucocytes during viral infections.

Shimizu F, Kahn CR, Garzelli C, Hooks JJ, Notkins AL.

The effect of viral infections on insulin binding in vivo was evaluated by
measuring the binding of 125I-insulin to several different tissues. We found that
splenic leucocytes from mice infected with either the diabetogenic (D) or
non-diabetogenic (B) variants of encephalomyocarditis virus, herpes simplex
virus, or lactic dehydrogenase virus showed up to a 130% increase in insulin
binding. As much as a 300% increase in the binding of 125I-insulin to splenic
leucocytes was observed in mice given bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In neither
virus-infected nor lipopolysaccharide-treated mice was there any substantial
change in insulin receptors on thymocytes, liver membranes, or peripheral
erythrocytes. Thus, the increased binding of insulin appears to be limited to
leucocytes and does not appear to represent a generalized metabolic alteration.
These experiments suggest that during infection, the binding of insulin to
leucocytes, which is widely used to measure insulin receptors, may not always
accurately reflect the insulin receptor status of other tissues.
