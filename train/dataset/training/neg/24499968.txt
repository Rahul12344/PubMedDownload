The origins of many plant diseases appear to be recent and associated with the
rise of domestication, the spread of agriculture or recent global movements of
crops. Distinguishing between these possibilities is problematic because of the
difficulty of determining rates of molecular evolution over short time frames.
Heterochronous approaches using recent and historical samples show that plant
viruses exhibit highly variable and often rapid rates of molecular evolution. The
accuracy of estimated evolution rates and age of origin can be greatly improved
with the inclusion of older molecular data from archaeological material. Here we 
present the first reconstruction of an archaeological RNA genome, which is of
Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV) isolated from barley grain ~750 years of age.
Phylogenetic analysis of BSMV that includes this genome indicates the divergence 
of BSMV and its closest relative prior to this time, most likely around 2000
years ago. However, exclusion of the archaeological data results in an apparently
much more recent origin of the virus that postdates even the archaeological
sample. We conclude that this viral lineage originated in the Near East or North 
Africa, and spread to North America and East Asia with their hosts along
historical trade routes.
