Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus infection in the common vole was examined for
the first time. Sixteen 8-week-old males inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(5) 
plaque-forming units (pfu)/animal of the D variant of EMC virus were killed 3 and
7 days after inoculation (3 and 7 DAI). Viral replication was detected in the
brain (10(5) pfu/g), heart (10(4) pfu/g) and pancreas (10(7) pfu/g) of all 8
animals at 3DAI. It was found in the pancreas (10(3) pfu/g) of all 8 animals and 
in the brain (10(4) pfu/g) of 2 of 8 animals at 7 DAI. Histopathological changes 
were observed in the brain (mild mononuclear cell infiltration around capillaries
and sporadic pyknosis of neurons), heart (minimal myocardial necrosis) and
pancreas (prominent acinar cell necrosis with inflammatory exudation) at 3DAI. At
7 DAI, replacement of necrotic tissues by mesenchymal cells and regeneration of
acinar cells were conspicuous in the pancreas. Throughout the experimental
period, no evidence for diabetogenic effect was found.
