Gene product 33 of phage T4 is known to be essential in late transcription.
Upstream from gene 33 and overlapping its 5' terminal sequence by 20 bp, we
identified an open reading frame coding for a binding protein for double-stranded
DNA (DsbA). Gene product DsbA is composed of 89 amino acid residues with a Mr of 
10376 kDa. We purified this protein to homogeneity from over-expressing cells.
Gel retardation assays reveal that it binds to DNA and footprint analyses
disclose that it interacts preferentially with T4 late promoter regions. At the
sites of binding the protein introduces nicks in double-stranded DNA. In vitro
transcription assays performed with T4 late modified RNA polymerase on
restriction fragments harbouring a T4 late promoter region prove that gene
product DsbA enhances transcription from these promoter regions in the presence
of gene product 33. Gene dsbA is distinct from gene das which maps close to this 
genomic region.
