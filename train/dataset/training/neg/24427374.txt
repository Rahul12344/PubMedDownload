Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lupus-like glomerulonephritis (GN) 
is a chronic immune complex disease occurring in HIV-infected patients. Although 
the light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy findings indicate features
of lupus nephritis, no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is observed
in the affected patients. We present the case of a 45-year-old Caucasian woman
with HIV infection who was admitted to the hospital with a nephrotic syndrome 10 
years after the HIV diagnosis. A renal biopsy revealed HIV-associated lupus-like 
GN and necrotizing arteritis affecting two interlobular arteries. Necrotizing
arteritis is a type of renal vasculopathy associated with SLE, but has not been
reported previously in HIV-associated lupus-like GN. In this case, necrotizing
arteritis was found to be a histological feature common to both HIV-associated
lupus-like GN and SLE. This histological finding reinforces the resemblance
between HIV-associated lupus-like GN and nephritis caused by lupus.
