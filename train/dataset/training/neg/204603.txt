Observation of togavirus-like particles in nonhuman primates.

Smith GC, Kalter SS, Heberling RL.

Particles resembling togaviruses were observed by electron microscopy in the
urinary bladder lamina propria of one capuchin monkey and in placental
syncytiotrophoblasts of one baboon. Type C viruses were observed in the baboon
placenta, but not in the tissues of the capuchin monkey.
