In May, 1985, the Red Cross Blood Donation Center of Vienna, Lower Austria, and
Burgenland started routine screening for HIV 1 antibodies; by summer 1989, about 
750,000 blood donors and donations had been examined. During this period, 59
donors have been proved positive for HIV 1; they have been interviewed and the
origin of the infection was explored. Since there were donors within this group, 
who had repeatedly given blood for many years, we carried out a follow-up study
in order to find out whether the recipients had been infected by these donors
before May, 1985. In addition, we give the test results of about 200,000 donors
screened for HIV 1 antigen and discuss the value of such tests. Recently, 80,000 
donors were screened for anti-HIV 1 and 2 antibodies; there has been no donor
positive for HIV 2, so far. A much higher number of donors than those marked for 
confirmed western blot had to be regarded as questionable positive. In such
cases, details of western blot results are listed; we discuss the problem of the 
evaluation of such results as well as the question of informing these donors.
