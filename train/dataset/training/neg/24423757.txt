HPV vaccination is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. The
greatest and the earliest health gains will be ensured by high vaccine coverage
among all susceptible people. The high costs and the risk of a reduced
cost/effectiveness ratio in sexually active girls still represent the main
obstacles for a more widespread use of HPV vaccination in many countries. Data on
the rate, risk factors, and HPV types in sexually active women could provide
information for the evaluation of vaccination policies extended to broader age
cohorts. Sexually active women aged 13-26 years enrolled in an Italian cohort
study were screened for cervical HPV infections; HPV-DNA positive samples were
genotyped by InnoLipa HPV Genotyping Extra or by RFLP genotype analysis.: Among
the 796 women meeting the inclusion criteria, 10.80% (95% CI 8.65-12.96) were
HPV-DNA infected. Age>18 years, lifetime sexual partners>1, and history of STIs
were associated to higher risk of HPV infection in the multivariable models
adjusted for age, lifetime sexual partners, and time of sexual exposure. The
global prevalence of the four HPV vaccine-types was 3.02% (95% CI 1.83-4.20) and 
the cumulative probability of infection from at least one vaccine-type was 12.82%
in 26-years-old women and 0.78% in 18-years-old women.: Our data confirm most of 
the previously reported findings on the risk factors for HPV infections. The low 
prevalence of the HPV vaccine-types found may be useful for the evaluation of the
cost/efficacy and the cost/effectiveness of broader immunization programs beyond 
the 12-years-old cohort.
