Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the simian rotavirus gene 6 that codes for the
major inner capsid protein.

Estes MK, Mason BB, Crawford S, Cohen J.

The nucleotide sequence of the gene that codes for the major inner capsid protein
of the simian rotavirus SA11 has been determined. A DNA copy of mRNA from gene 6 
was cloned in the E. coli plasmid pBR322. The full-length gene is 1357
nucleotides long with a 5'-noncoding region of 23 nucleotides and a 3'-noncoding 
region of 140 nucleotides. The gene contains a single, long, open reading-frame
of 1194 nucleotides capable of coding for a protein of 397 amino acids with a
molecular weight of 44,816. The predicted protein product is relatively
proline-rich with a net charge at neutral pH of -3.5. One stretch of 53 amino
acids (encoded by nucleotides 327-485) is basic.
