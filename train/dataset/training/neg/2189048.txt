Non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be defined as an increased
responsiveness of the respiratory airways to physical, chemical and
pharmacological stimuli. It is a characteristic feature of asthma. Knowledge of
the mechanisms contributing to bronchial hyperresponsiveness can provide an
insight into the pathogenesis of asthma and could lead to an improved therapy.
Several abnormalities have been postulated to underlie the hyperresponsiveness,
such as a beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, hyperreactivity of airway smooth muscle,
epithelial dysfunction or damage, increased reflex bronchoconstriction, mucus
plugging and mucosal oedema. It is possible that more than one of these
abnormalities or other, as yet unknown, mechanisms are involved. In contrast to
the role of lymphocytes in the regulation of IgE antibody production, the role of
these cells in bronchial hyperresponsiveness has received little attention. We
review evidence indicating that lymphocytes are involved in the development of
non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some animal models and in patients 
with asthma.
