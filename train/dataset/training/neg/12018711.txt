The review of recent studies using DNA microarrays shed new light on herpes
simplex virus (HSV) replicative cycle, the response of immature dendritic cells
(DCs) to pathogens and the response of neurons in trigeminal ganglia to virus
reactivation. These studies provided a better understanding of the molecular
biology of HSV during infection, latency and reactivation. The research on the
sensory trigeminal neurons and the neuronal axons (type C fibers) that transverse
the skin basal membrane, enter the skin epidermis and interact with the cell
membrane of the skin resident immature DCs provided an insight on the connection 
between the nervous system and the host immune system. Based on these studies a
hypothesis is presented suggesting that HSV evolved to use the human host defense
systems (pain signals, the immune system cells and sensory neurons) to ensure its
entry from the skin epithelium into the sensory neurons. Reactivated HSV in the
neurons utilizes the same host defense systems to return to the skin epithelium.
