Previous studies demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing human
neurofilament heavy (hNF-H) protein develop a progressive motor neuron disease
characterized by the perikaryal accumulations of neurofilaments resembling those 
found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To further investigate this
neurofilament-induced pathology, we generated transgenic mice expressing, solely 
or concomitantly, the hNF-H and the human neurofilament light (hNF-L) proteins.
We report here that the motor neuron disease caused by excess hNF-H proteins can 
be rescued by overexpression of hNF-L in a dosage-dependent fashion. In hNF-H
transgenic mice, the additional hNF-L led to reduction of perikaryal swellings,
relief of axonal transport defect and restoration of axonal radial growth. A gene
delivery approach based on recombinant adenoviruses bearing the hNF-L gene also
demonstrated the possibility to reduce perikaryal swellings after their formation
in adult mice. The finding that extra NF-L can protect against NF-H-mediated
pathogenesis is of potential importance for ALS, particularly for cases with NF-H
abnormalities.
