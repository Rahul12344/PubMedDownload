BACKGROUND: The impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections on patient long-term
survival after renal transplants is unclear.
METHOD: To clarify the long-term outcomes of Japanese renal allograft recipients 
with HCV infections, we studied the cases of 187 patients (118 males and 69
females; 155 living donor cases, and 32 deceased donor cases; median follow-up
period: 250 months) who underwent an initial renal transplant at Kanazawa Medical
University from 1974 onwards.
RESULT: In this cohort, 35 patients (18.7%) were HCV core antigen (Ag)-positive, 
and 13 of them (37.1%) died (due to liver cirrhosis (4 cases), hepatocellular
carcinoma (1 case), fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis due to HCV (1 case), and
infections complicated with chronic hepatitis (6 cases)). However, only 14 of the
145 (9.7%) recipients died in the HCV-Ag/HCV antibody (Ab)-negative group. The
Kaplan-Meier life table method indicated that the HCV-infected group exhibited
significantly lower patient and death-censored allograft survival rates (log-rank
test; patient survival: Chi-square: 11.2, p = 0.004; graft survival: Chi-square: 
25.7, p < 0.001). The survival rate of the HCV-Ag-positive recipients decreased
rapidly at 240 months after the renal transplant procedure. In addition, a Cox
proportional hazards model indicated that positivity for the HCV-Ag was the most 
important independent risk factor for post-renal transplant survival and
allograft function [survival: hazard ratio (HR) 3.93 (1.54-10.03), p = 0.004;
graft function: HR 2.09 (1.14-3.81), p = 0.016].
CONCLUSION: HCV infection is a harmful risk factor for patient survival
(especially at ≥20 years post-renal transplant) and renal allograft function in
allograft recipients.
