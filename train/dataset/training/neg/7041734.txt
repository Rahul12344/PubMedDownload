Genetic approaches to study export of LamB to the outer membrane.

Benson S, Emr S, Hall M, Silhavy T, Sodergren E.

We are studying the molecular mechanism of cellular protein localization. The
availability of genetic techniques, such as gene fusion in Escherichia coli, has 
made this subject particularly amenable to study in this prokaryote. We have
constructed a variety of strains in which the gene coding for an outer membrane
protein is fused to the gene coding for a normally cytoplasmic enzyme,
beta-galactosidase. The hybrid protein produced by such strains retain
beta-galactosidase activity; this activity serves as a simple biochemical tag for
studying the localization of the outer membrane protein. In addition, we have
exploited phenotypes exhibited by certain fusion strains to isolate mutants that 
are altered in the process of protein export. Genetic and biochemical analyses of
such mutants have provided important insights into the mechanism of protein
localization.
