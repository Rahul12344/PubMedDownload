Transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm the presence of picorna-like
virus particles presumed to be Homalodisca coagulata virus-1 (HoCV-1) in the
midgut region of adult glassy-winged sharpshooters (GWSS). In addition, we offer 
a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the
detection of this virus with a sensitivity of approximately 95 genome
equivalents. A survey employing this assay in conjunction with GWSS samples
collected throughout the United States including California, Hawaii, Florida
Georgia, and the Carolinas revealed a fairly widespread pattern of distribution, 
although potentially restricted to temperate regions, areas with elevated host
densities, or to populations of a common origin. The virus was found to naturally
infect adults regardless of host plant and was not specific to a particular
lifestage or sex. Examination of alternate leafhopper species further
demonstrated that, although infection is not ubiquitous to all sharpshooter
genera, HoCV-1 is not limited to Homalodisca vitripennis (=H. coagulata).
