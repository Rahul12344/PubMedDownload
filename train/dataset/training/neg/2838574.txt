The DNA sequence of a clustered set of genes which are conserved in
orthopoxviruses has been determined for the avipoxvirus, fowlpox virus. The
arrangement of the genes in fowlpox virus is nearly identical to that in vaccinia
virus, and genes which are overlapping in vaccinia virus overlap in fowlpox
virus. One major difference exists however, as the thymidine kinase (TK) gene is 
absent in fowlpox virus from the position it occupies within this cluster of
genes in vaccinia virus. Instead, in fowlpox virus there is a 32 bp non-coding
region present between the genes that flank the TK gene in vaccinia virus. The
fowlpox virus TK gene has been cloned and sequenced. The sequences immediately
flanking the TK gene show no homology to any previously reported poxvirus gene.
These results are discussed in terms of genome stability in poxviruses and the
use of the TK gene as a non-essential region for the introduction of foreign
genes into poxviruses.
