The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that, while
typically asymptomatic, can cause neurological symptoms in adults and birth
defects in babies born to infected mothers. The interactions of ZIKV with many
different pathways in the human host ultimately determine successful virus
replication and ZIKV-induced pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms of
such host-ZIKV interactions have just begun to be elucidated. Here, we summarize 
the recent advances that defined the mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes
antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, with a particular focus on evasion of
the type I interferon response in the human host. Furthermore, we describe
emerging evidence that indicated the contribution of several cell-intrinsic
mechanisms to an effective restriction of ZIKV infection, such as
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, stress granule formation, and "reticulophagy", a
type of selective autophagy. Finally, we summarize the recent work that
identified strategies by which ZIKV modulated these intrinsic antiviral
responses.
