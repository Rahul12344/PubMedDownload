Bloodmeal sources of Aedes triseriatus and Aedes vexans in a southern Wisconsin
forest endemic for La Crosse encephalitis virus.

Burkot TR, DeFoliart GR.

The micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to specifically
identify bloodmeal sources of Aedes triseriatus Say and Aedes vexans Meigen
collected at a site endemic for La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis virus. Deer were the
source of 65% of Ae. triseriatus and 94% of Aedes vexans bloodmeals,
respectively. Chipmunks and tree squirrels, which are considered to be the major 
vertebrate amplifying hosts of LAC virus, were the sources of 8% and 16%,
respectively, of the bloodmeals of Ae. triseriatus, the vector of LAC virus. The 
relatively small proportion of vector bloodmeals taken from the amplifying hosts 
raises further doubts as to the significance of vertebrate amplification in
perpetutation of La Crosse virus in nature, i.e. whether vertebrate amplification
alone is sufficient to make up for the shortfall of virus infection that occurs
during vertical transmission.
