Prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus antigens in the feces of normal cows.

Crouch CF, Acres SD.

The prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus shedding by adult cows was
investigated using capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Fecal samples from
121 cows in a single herd were tested for the presence of rotavirus and
coronavirus, either free or complexed with immunoglobulin. Free rotavirus was not
detected in any samples while rotavirus-immunoglobulin complexes were detected in
53 of 121 (44%) samples tested. In contrast, free coronavirus was detected in six
(5%) samples and coronavirus-immunoglobulin complexes were detected in 85 (70%)
of the samples tested. Thus it appears that subclinical infection of cows by
either of these viruses is common, possibly providing a source for infection of
the neonate. These assays may therefore provide important information regarding
the epidemiology of enteric virus infections and suggest means of improving
management to prevent epidemics of neonatal diarrhea.
