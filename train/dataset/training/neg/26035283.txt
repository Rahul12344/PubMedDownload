Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is prevalent, deadly, and seldom cured 
due to the persistence of viral episomal DNA (cccDNA) in infected cells. Newly
developed genome engineering tools may offer the ability to directly cleave viral
DNA, thereby promoting viral clearance. Here, we show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system
can specifically target and cleave conserved regions in the HBV genome, resulting
in robust suppression of viral gene expression and replication. Upon sustained
expression of Cas9 and appropriately chosen guide RNAs, we demonstrate cleavage
of cccDNA by Cas9 and a dramatic reduction in both cccDNA and other parameters of
viral gene expression and replication. Thus, we show that directly targeting
viral episomal DNA is a novel therapeutic approach to control the virus and
possibly cure patients.
