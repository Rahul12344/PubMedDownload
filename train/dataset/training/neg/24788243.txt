DDX6 (Rck/p54), a member of the DEAD-box family of helicases, is highly conserved
from unicellular eukaryotes to vertebrates. Functions of DDX6 and its orthologs
in dynamic ribonucleoproteins contribute to global and transcript-specific
messenger RNA (mRNA) storage, translational repression, and decay during
development and differentiation in the germline and somatic cells. Its role in
pathways that promote mRNA-specific alternative translation initiation has been
shown to be linked to cellular homeostasis, deregulated tissue development, and
the control of gene expression in RNA viruses. Recently, DDX6 was found to
participate in mRNA regulation mediated by miRNA-mediated silencing. DDX6 and its
orthologs have versatile functions in mRNA metabolism, which characterize them as
important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression.
