This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the effects of multiple doses of
peginterferon alfa-2b on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of methadone in 20
adults with hepatitis C virus infection who were enrolled in a methadone
maintenance program. All subjects received peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mug/kg/wk
for 4 weeks and maintained their normal methadone regimen. Serial blood samples
were collected immediately before the first and after the fourth peginterferon
alfa-2b dose (day 23). At day 23, exposure to the active methadone R-enantiomer
increased by approximately 15% following administration of peginterferon alfa-2b,
with 90% confidence intervals just outside the bioequivalence criteria (range,
80%-125%). Similar increases in exposure (C(max), AUC(0-24), and AUC(last)) were 
observed with S-methadone and total methadone. Peginterferon alfa-2b was well
tolerated. Peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with minor increases in exposure
to methadone in individuals with hepatitis C virus infection; however, these
increases are unlikely to be clinically meaningful and are not associated with
any safety concerns.
