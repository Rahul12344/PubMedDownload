The nucleotide sequence was determined for 2.75 kbp of phage Mu DNA encoding the 
contractile tail sheath protein L. N-terminal sequence analysis of Mu tail tube
and sheath proteins identified the open reading frame just downstream of gene L
as the tube gene. This clustering and order of the sheath and tube genes appear
to be common among the myoviridae. Database homology searches revealed high
similarity between the Mu sheath and tube proteins and two proteins in a
Haemophilus influenzae Mu-like prophage, suggesting that they are the sheath and 
tube proteins of that prophage.
