OBJECTIVES: Here we tested the hypothesis that multiple toxic and infectious
stressors combine in their adverse effects to produce higher tissue responses of 
metallothioneins (MTs) in birds.
METHODS: We used Japanese quails as a model avian species. The study is based on 
data obtained from single and combined exposures of Japanese quails to
cyanobacterial biomass containing microcystins, lead and a live Newcastle disease
vaccination virus. Eight groups of 5 birds were exposed to single, double and
triple combinations of these stressors and compared with controls. Birds were
euthanized after the 30-day exposure to collect brain, liver, kidney, and
pectoral muscle for MTs measurement.
RESULTS: Baseline levels of MTs differed in avian tissues. The gradient of MTs in
control quails was pectoral muscle < liver < brain < kidney. Double and triple
exposures induced higher levels of MTs. While increases of MTs were driven mainly
by dietary exposure to cyanobacterial biomass and/or lead, Newcastle disease
vaccination induced the least response. Induction of brain MTs was dominated by
exposure to lead. Patterns of MTs responses were similar in the liver and
pectoral muscle as well as in the kidney and brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding better responses of birds to oxidative stress induced 
by toxic and infectious stressors may have implications for avian conservation
issues and disease risk assessment.
