SETTING: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients reported in North Carolina (NC),
USA, from 1996 to 2008 (inclusive).
OBJECTIVE: To compare prevalence of cavitary TB as a surrogate marker for
advanced disease in low-caseload counties with high-caseload counties.
DESIGN: A multivariate log binomial regression model was used to estimate
prevalence ratios (PRs) for cavitary TB.
RESULTS: The proportion of TB cases in low-caseload counties vs. the total number
of TB cases in NC over the study period increased from 10% in 1996 to 20% in
2008. After adjusting for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, excess
alcohol use and report year, patients in rural areas of low-caseload counties had
greater prevalence (PR 1.40, 95%CI 1.19-1.64) of cavitary disease compared with
patients from rural areas of high-caseload counties. The prevalence of cavitary
TB did not differ between urban residents of high- or low-caseload counties (PR
1.00, 95%CI 0.86-1.16) after adjusting for HIV status, excess alcohol use and
report year.
DISCUSSION: TB patients in rural areas of low-caseload counties presented with
more advanced TB disease compared with patients from urban and/or high-caseload
counties. Barriers to timely recognition of TB in rural low-caseload settings
must be considered in TB control programs.
