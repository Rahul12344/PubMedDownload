When MDCK cells in a semiconfluent monolayer were infected with 5 p.f.u. per cell
of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), a majority of the cells continued to grow
stably upon subsequent cultivation with a growth medium containing 50% foetal
calf serum. While growing, the cells spontaneously excreted virus, the amount of 
which declined gradually as the passage number of the cells increased. The extent
of virus shedding was significantly increased when the cells were subsequently
maintained in a medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Within the cells,
viral messenger RNAs for all eight genes of A/PR/8 were demonstrated by PCR
indicating that endogenous viral genes were constitutively transcribed. However, 
viral proteins as well as viral genes were not demonstrable by
radioimmunoprecipitation or ribonuclease protection assays, respectively.
