To examine the role of human beta-globin enhancers in tissue-specific and
developmental regulation, a hybrid beta-globin-simian virus 40 gene was analyzed 
in transgenic mice. A beta-globin DNA fragment containing two previously defined 
enhancers stimulated transcription from the simian virus 40 promoter in a tissue-
and stage-specific pattern similar to that of the normal beta-globin gene. These 
results help to define the functions of beta-globin regulatory elements and
suggest an approach for targeted expression of heterologous genes in erythroid
cells in vivo.
