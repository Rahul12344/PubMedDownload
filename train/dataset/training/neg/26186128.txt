OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess nevirapine (NVP) resistance
in infants who became infected in the three arms of the Breastfeeding,
Antiretrovirals and Nutrition (BAN) study: daily infant NVP prophylaxis, triple
maternal antiretrovirals or no extra intervention for 28 weeks of breastfeeding.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
METHODS: The latest available plasma or dried blood spot specimen was tested from
infants who became HIV-positive between 3 and 48 weeks of age. Population
sequencing was used to detect mutations associated with reverse transcriptase
inhibitor resistance. Sequences were obtained from 22 out of 25 transmissions in 
the infant-NVP arm, 23 out of 30 transmissions in the maternal-antiretroviral arm
and 33 out of 38 transmissions in the control arm.
RESULTS: HIV-infected infants in the infant-NVP arm were significantly more
likely to have NVP resistance than infected infants in the other two arms of the 
trial, especially during breastfeeding through 28 weeks of age (56% in infant-NVP
arm vs. 6% in maternal-antiretroviral arm and 11% in control arm, PÂ¼0.004). There
was a nonsignificant trend, suggesting that infants with NVP resistance tended to
be infected earlier and exposed to NVP while infected for a greater duration than
infants without resistance.
CONCLUSION: Infants on NVP prophylaxis during breastfeeding are at a reduced risk
of acquiring HIV, but are at an increased risk of NVP resistance if they do
become infected. These findings point to the need for frequent HIV testing of
infants while on NVP prophylaxis, and for the availability of antiretroviral
regimens excluding NVP for treating infants who become infected while on such a
prophylactic regimen.
