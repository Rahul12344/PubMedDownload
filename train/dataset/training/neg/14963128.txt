The matrix domain (MA) is important for targeting of human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 Gag assembly to the plasma membrane, envelope incorporation into virions, 
preintegration complex import into the nucleus, and nuclear export of viral RNA. 
Myristylation and phosphorylation are key regulatory events for MA function.
Previous studies have indicated that MA phosphorylation at serine (Ser) residues 
is important for viral replication. This study defines the molecular mechanisms
of virus particle assembly and infectivity through a detailed study of the role
of MA serine phosphorylation. We show that the combined mutation of Ser residues 
at positions 9, 67, 72, and 77 impairs viral infectivity in dividing and
nondividing cells, although the assembly of these Ser mutant viruses is
comparable to that of wild-type virus. This defect can be rescued by pseudotyping
these mutant viruses with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, suggesting that
these serine residues are critical in an early postentry step of viral infection.
The phosphorylation level of MA in defective mutant viruses was severely reduced 
compared to that of the wild type, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-9, -67,
-72, and -77 is important for an early postentry step during virus infection.
