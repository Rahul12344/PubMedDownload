[Histomorphologic picture of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis].

[Article in German]

Wiese M, Haupt R.

Basing on several international studies on the light microscopic pattern of acute
non-A, non-B hepatitis we tried to discover the histological criteria of its
chronic course by means of a detailed analysis of 181 liver biopsies of 94
patients suffering from chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (a homogeneous group
without competing noxious agents). In accordance with the relevant literature we 
found a rate of chronic courses of about 60% with chronic persistent hepatitis
(2/3) and chronic lobular hepatitis (1/3) predominating. A transition into liver 
cirrhosis was not stated. As changes typical of the chronic non-A, non-B
hepatitis cell ballooning (89%), changes of cell nuclei (88%), eosinophilic
changes of cytoplasm (73%), focal sinusoidal cell activation (92%) and
microvesicular steatosis (59%) were ascertained with the chronological analysis
showing that there were no changes of these criteria up to the 6th year of
disease. Its cause is seen in an incomplete elimination of the hepatitis viruses 
as a result of inefficient immune defence.
