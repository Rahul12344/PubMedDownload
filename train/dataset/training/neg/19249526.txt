OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major burden after liver
transplantation. There is no effective treatment for these patients, therefore
management is challenging. Cyclophilins are essential host factors for HCV
replication. We have reported herein the efficacy of divided administration of
interferon (IFN) beta plus cyclosporine for chronic hepatitis C patients who
failed pegylated (Peg)-IFN or IFN combined ribavirin treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 59 patients (median age, 63
years) with genotype 1b who failed to respond to the combinations of IFN plus
ribavirin or Peg-IFN plus ribavirin. Our treatment involved induction,
intensified, and maintenance therapies. The induction therapy prescribed
intravenous 1 MU IFN beta every 4 hours for the first 3 days, 1.5 MU IFN beta
every 6 hours for the next 4 days, and then 2 MU IFN beta every 8 hours for 3
weeks. The intensified therapy was the induction therapy shortened to 2 weeks.
The maintenance therapy involved Peg-IFN alpha 2b and ribavirin. Cyclosporine was
given 4 times daily during the induction and intensified therapies. Ribavirin was
given twice daily during the maintenance phase.
RESULTS: The end treatment and sustained virological response rates in the
present study were 73% (43/59) and 59% (35/59), respectively. The relapse rate
was 19% (8/43). Sixteen percent of patients (3/19) were nonresponders. All
adverse effects were reversible. The treatment protocol was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Our protocol should be effective for patients who have failed
previous combination therapies.
