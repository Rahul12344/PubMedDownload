Improved hemagglutination inhibition assay for mammary tumor virus antigen.

Gillette RW, Junker D.

It is our experience that the use of sheep red blood cells pretreated with
formaldehyde and pyruvaldehyde before sensitizing with viral antigen yields
results that are comparable to that obtained by using the tannic acid method. The
double aldehyde method provides the added advantage of being useful for assaying 
the viral antigen content in substances which contain high levels of interfering 
substances which would preclude the use of other assay methods.
