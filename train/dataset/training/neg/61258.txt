Papova virus-like particles in a nigral type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

de Reuck J, de Coster W, Otte G, vander Eecken H.

In this case of Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease cortical biopsy demonstrated a large
number of papova virus-like particles in the axons, dendrites, astroyctic
processes and blood-vessel walls, while necropsy findings disclosed a striking
status spongiosus and neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra. The patient 
also suffered from a testicular feminization syndrome and was treated with
immunosuppressive drugs for pemphigus vulgaris. The ready demonstration of viral 
particles, the rapid course of the disease and the unusual necropsy findings are 
discussed and related to the pre-existing diseases of the patient.
