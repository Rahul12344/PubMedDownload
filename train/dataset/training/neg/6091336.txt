Mechanism of inhibition of herpesvirus growth by 2'-5'-linked trimer of
9-beta-D-xylofuranosyladenine.

Goswami BB, Gosselin G, Imbach JL, Sharma OK.

The 2'-5'-linked trimer of 9-beta-D-xylofuranosyladenine (XyloA)3 is an extremely
potent inhibitor of growth of herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2. Evidence is
presented that in spite of its increased stability in cell-free extracts (D.A.

detected in Vero cells, but instead was rapidly degraded in the medium to
monomeric 9-beta-D-xylofuranosyladenine (XyloA). The XyloA thus formed was
rapidly taken up by cells, phosphorylated to its triphosphate, and produced
inhibition of RNA synthesis. The observed inhibition of DNA synthesis (D.A.

Nature (London) 302, 723, 724, 1983) is most likely the result of inhibition of
RNA synthesis by its degradation product XyloA.
