The tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepinone (TIBO) derivatives, as
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, acquire a significant place in
the treatment of the infections by the HIV. In the present paper, the support
vector machines (SVM) are used to develop quantitative relationships between the 
anti-HIV activity and four molecular descriptors of 82 TIBO derivatives. The
results obtained by SVM give good statistical results compared to those given by 
multiple linear regressions and artificial neural networks. The contribution of
each descriptor to structure-activity relationships was evaluated. It indicates
the importance of the hydrophobic parameter. The proposed method can be
successfully used to predict the anti-HIV of TIBO derivatives with only four
molecular descriptors which can be calculated directly from molecular structure
alone.
