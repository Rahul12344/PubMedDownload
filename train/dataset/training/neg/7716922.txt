spheres].

Sidorova EV, Borisova TK, Rozen A.

A method for isolation of human B cells specific to viral peptides using magnetic
beads has been developed. The method was used for the isolation from human
tonsils of B cells specific to HIV-1 gp 120 MN-24 peptide (residues 302-322) and 
to Epstein-Barr virus 107 EBNA-1 peptide. The cells selected with beads were
transformed by Epstein-Barr virus. The resultant cell cultures produce human
immunoglobulin antibodies to HIV-1 MN-24 and to Epstein-Barr EBNA-1 p107
peptides.
