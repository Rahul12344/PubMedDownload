Unlike most beta-related phages isolated from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, phage 
782 readily plaqued on strains of C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis. The
extended host range of phage 782 was not, however, due to a greater ability of
the phage to absorb to bacterial surfaces. Using chemical mutagenesis, a number
of phage mutants were isolated which had diminished capacities to infect C.
ulcerans, suggesting the existence of a locus (ehr) for extended host range.
Pre-lysogenization of C. ulcerans strains with phage 782, but not its mutant form
or other beta-related phages, rendered them susceptible to infection by
previously excluded phages. An examination of recombinant between phages 782,
pie, and beta localized ehr to a 7 kilobase region of DNA including attP. The
data are compatible with the notion that ehr encodes an anti-restriction
function.
