The 2A region of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) encodes a short sequence
that mediates self-processing by a novel translational effect. Translation
elongation arrest leads to release of the nascent polypeptide and re-initiation
at the next in-frame codon. In this way discrete translation products are derived
from a single open reading frame. Active 2A-like sequences have been found in
(many) other viruses and trypanosome non-LTR retrotransposons. Exponential growth
of 2A technology within the last decade has lead to many
biotechnological/biomedical applications including the generation of transgenic
plants/animals and genetic manipulation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
