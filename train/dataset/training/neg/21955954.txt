BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory, granulomatous disorder of unknown
etiology. The role of cellular and humoral immune systems in this disease is
unclear, whereas dysregulation of the immune system is suggested. Patients with
sarcoidosis show diverse responses while exposed to various antigens. Although
influenza vaccination is recommended in pulmonary sarcoidosis, its efficacy and
safety has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVES:   To evaluate safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in
patients with sarcoidosis.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Influenza vaccination was performed in 23 eligible patients
with sarcoidosis (SP) and 26 healthy controls (HC). Antibody titers against H1N1,
H3N2, and B influenza virus antigens were evaluated just before and 1 month after
vaccination. Patients were followed for 6 months to assess vaccine safety.
RESULTS: Serological response and magnitude of changes in antibody titers against
influenza vaccine antigens were comparable between SPs and HCs. Women showed a
better serological response against B antigen (P = 0·034) than men.
Twenty-four-hour urine calcium was associated with antibody response against H1N1
[correlation coefficient (CC) = 0·477, P = 0·003] and H3N2 (CC = 0·352, P =
0·028) antigens. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme correlated negatively with
antibody response against B antigen (CC = -0·331, P = 0·040). Higher residual
volume was associated with fewer rises in antibody titer against H3N2 antigen (CC
= -0·377, P = 0·035). No major adverse events or disease flare-up was observed
during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, influenza vaccination did not cause any major adverse
event in SPs, and their serological response was equal to HCs. Studies with
larger sample size and a broader selection of subjects could help validate the
results of this study.
