Several non-culture molecular (multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays, DNA
microarrays, massive parallel DNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, microbiome
profiling, and molecular typing of pathogens) and analytical (electrophoresis,
gel electrophoresis, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, and mass spectrometry)
tools have been developed in recent years for the identification of bacteria and 
diagnosis of bacterial infections from clinical samples. Among mass spectrometric
techniques, electrospray ionization (ESI) and rapid evaporative ionization (REI) 
mass spectrometric (MS) techniques have attracted much attention in the
identification of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses), and in the
diagnosis of various bacterial infections. This review highlights the developed
ESI-MS-based methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with
ESI-MS and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and liquid chromatography (LC)-ESI-MS, 
for the identification of microorganisms (pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and
viruses) in various samples. Recent applications of ESI- and REI-MS in
identifying pathogenic bacteria are depicted in tables, and some significant
findings are summarized.
