Hand protection against viral pathogens.

Fay MF.

In today's health care setting, being either a hospitalised patient or a health
care worker carries some degree of risk. One significant risk is potential
exposure to viruses, bacteria and/or antibiotic-resistant organisms which may be 
transmitted from the hands of workers or by worker contact with infected
patients. The risk of transmission by these pathogens is determined by three main
factors: The nature and frequency of contact with blood, body fluids or
infectious material The inoculum load and risk of transmission after a single
exposure to the pathogen The prevalence of infected, susceptible patients or
health care workers. During the past few years, occupational health standards and
universal infection control guidelines were enacted to minimise these exposure
events. In addition to common sense infection control practices, the new
regulations require the use of engineering controls and personal protective
equipment to alleviate the chance of personal contact with potentially infectious
material.
