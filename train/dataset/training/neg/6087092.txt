Immunoglobulin classes of anti-Sendai virus antibody detected by ELISA in
infected nude mouse serum.

Sendai virus-infected nude mouse sera obtained on the seventh day after infection
or later, in which anti-Sendai virus antibodies were undetectable by
hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization tests, were found to be reactive
with the virus antigen by ELISA using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG rabbit IgG. The reactivity was blocked by rabbit anti-Sendai virus
antiserum and was not observed against influenza virus which served as a control 
antigen. Anti-Sendai virus antibody activity of fractions from Sephadex G-200 gel
filtration was detected in the IgM fraction when anti-mouse mu chain-specific
antiserum was used and in both IgG and IgM fractions when heavy and light
chain-specific anti-mouse IgG serum was employed in ELISA. ELISA of the fractions
from protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography of Sendai virus-infected nude
mouse sera showed that the eluates at pH 6.0 and pH 3.5 contained IgG1 and IgG2b 
anti-Sendai virus anti-bodies, respectively, and that the eluate at pH 4.5
contained both IgG2a and IgG3 antibodies.
