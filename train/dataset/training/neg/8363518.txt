Chicken anemia agent (CAA)-antibody-positive and -negative broiler chicks and
specific-pathogen-free chicks were confined in six broiler houses. Data on
seroconversion to common avian pathogens and production performance were
collected. No significant differences were seen between CAA-antibody-positive and
-negative chickens in geometric mean antibody titers against common avian
pathogens or in production performance.
