Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that process and 
present antigenic peptides and are capable of generating potent T-cell immunity. 
A murine tumor model was developed to evaluate methods of genetic immunization to
the human MART-1/Melan-A (MART-1) melanoma antigen. A poorly immunogenic murine
fibrosarcoma line (NFSA) was stably transfected with the MART-1 gene. This
transfected tumor [NFSA(MART1)] grows progressively in C3Hf/Kam/Sed (H-2k) mice. 
Partial protection against a challenge with NFSA(MART1) could be achieved with
i.m. injections of a MART-1 expression plasmid or with systemic administration of
an adenovirus vector expressing MART-1. However, superior protection was achieved
when granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor/interleukin-4-differentiated murine DCs transduced with an adenovirus
vector expressing MART-1 were used for immunization. Both partial and complete
protection could be achieved with i.v. administration of MART-1-engineered DCs.
Splenocytes from immunized mice contained MHC class 1-restricted CTLs specific
for MART-1. This preclinical model of genetic immunization supports a therapeutic
strategy for human melanoma.
