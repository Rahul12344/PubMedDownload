Notable efforts have been made to relate aspects of the cell biology of T cells
to the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment T-cell neoplasms. In particular, the
application of molecular biologic tools to these areas has already allowed the
generation of patient-specific markers for disease. A case can be made that a
knowledge of the distinctive natural history of T-cell neoplasms should influence
choices of treatment. Additional insights into the relevance of the human T-cell 
leukemia-lymphoma virus family to human disease have been recorded, and an
important association of cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders with
human immunodeficiency virus infection has been documented.
