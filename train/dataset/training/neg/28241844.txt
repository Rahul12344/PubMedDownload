BACKGROUND: Effective therapeutic management of elderly patients with cancer, on 
an individual basis, remains a clinical challenge. Here, we identify novel
biomarkers to assess elderly patients (≥70 years of age) with breast cancer
undergoing treatment with or without chemotherapy.
METHODS: We performed comprehensive geriatric assessment and measured markers
sensitive to alteration in ageing, including leukocyte telomere length, CMV
serostatus, levels of circulating growth factors and cytokines, and immune
profiling of T cell and myeloid populations in blood before and at 3 months and
12 months after initiation of therapy, using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We observed changes in immune profiles over time that were specific to
patients receiving chemotherapy; these patients had elevated CD4+ T effector
memory re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) cells and relatively lower CD8+ central
memory cells at 3 months, with normalized levels after 12 months. Patients'
baseline immune profiles correlated with markers such as telomere length,
cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus and levels of circulating cytokines. We also
identified correlations between baseline immune profile and geriatric assessment,
i.e. more frail patients had higher levels of granulocytic cells but lower levels
of cells with suppressor phenotypes including myeloid-derived suppressor cells
and regulatory T cells, although none of the examined immune populations
correlated with chronological age. Importantly, immune profiles prior to therapy 
predicted unexpected hospitalizations in patients receiving chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that immune profiling may represent a novel
complementary approach to more accurately assess the global health status of the 
elderly patient with breast cancer and select the most appropriate individual
treatment option.
