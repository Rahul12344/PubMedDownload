Detection of West Nile virus (WNV) RNA in urine has been anecdotally described
and proposed for the diagnosis of WNV infection. This study reports the routine
use of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for the
detection of WNV RNA in urine to support diagnosis of WNV infection during the
large outbreak that occurred in northeastern Italy in 2012. Fourteen of 32
patients (43.8%) with symptomatic WNV infection, defined as neuroinvasive disease
and fever, had detectable WNV RNA in urine at the time of diagnosis, at a higher 
rate and load and for a longer time than detection of WNV RNA in blood. Detection
of WNV RNA in urine was less frequent (2 of 14 patients [14.2%]) in blood donors 
in whom WNV infection was identified by WNV nucleic acid amplification testing.
Infectious virus was isolated from the urine of a patient with neuroinvasive
disease and a high WNV RNA load in urine.
