The antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (OSV) is widely used to
suppress viral replication in the treatment of influenza. Here, we report that
OSV administration significantly suppressed respiratory mucosal secretory IgA
responses with respect to antigen (Ag)-specific antibody (Ab) production and also
the induction of Ag-specific IgA Ab-forming cells, but not systemic IgG
responses, in weanling mice as a model of pediatric influenza. Neutralizing
activities of the airway fluids in oral OSV-treated mice were significantly less 
than those of sham-treated mice. Our findings suggest the risk of re-infection in
patients showing a low mucosal response following OSV treatment.
