Monoclonal antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins show that
epitope location influences virus neutralization.

La Thangue NB, Chan WL, Almeida JD.

Three monoclonal antibodies, G8D1 , C2D2 , and TI57 , reacting with herpes
simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins have been characterised according to the
location of their epitope and ability to neutralize infective virus. Immune
electron microscopy and a blocking radioimmunoassay were used to locate the
epitopes. The results indicate that the epitope recognised by G8D1 is located on 
the surface of the glycoprotein fringe, whereas those recognized by C2D2 and TI57
are interior with respect to this. Only G8D1 has neutralizing activity alone,
whereas C2D2 can neutralize when antiglobulin is added. Thus, epitope location
and density determine the neutralizing capacity of individual antibody molecules.
