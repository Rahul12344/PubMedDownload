P1 plasmid replication: multiple functions of RepA protein at the origin.

Chattoraj DK, Snyder KM, Abeles AL.

Replication functions of a bacteriophage P1 miniplasmid are carried on a
1.2-kilobase pair (kb) segment that can be subdivided into a 245-base pair (bp)
replication origin and a 959-bp region that encodes a protein required for
replication (RepA). The origin region contains five 19-bp direct repeats. By
using primer extension and gene-fusion assays, we mapped the promoter of the repA
gene within the repeated sequences and showed that the promoter is repressed by
RepA. Regulation of RepA synthesis is apparently achieved by the binding of RepA 
to the repeat sequences. This regulation might be a key step in the
replication-control circuit, as we found that overproduction of RepA (from a
foreign promoter) inhibits replication. Thus, in addition to being an
autoregulated activator of replication, the protein also can have a negative
regulatory role.
