We report a case of uveitic acute angle closure glaucoma in a patient with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated with inactive
cytomegalovirus retinitis and immune recovery vitritis. We conducted a long-term,
follow-up examination of a 47-year-old male with AIDS and inactive
cytomegalovirus retinitis caused by immune recovery on highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We found vitritis and ultimate development of
uveitic glaucoma in the postoperative periods following repair of retinal
detachment and extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant.
An episode of acute angle closure secondary to posterior synechiae and iris bomb√©
subsequently developed, requiring peripheral laser iridotomy. Immune recovery in 
the setting of inactive cytomegalovirus retinitis can result in intraocular
inflammation severe enough to cause angle closure glaucoma and profound ocular
morbidity.
