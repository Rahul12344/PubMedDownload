SV40 (simian virus 40) is a double-stranded DNA virus and is strongly oncogenic
in experimental animals. SV40 enters cells by atypical endocytosis mediated by
caveolae, transporting the virus to its usual destination, namely the endoplasmic
reticulum. The cellular mechanisms of capsid disassembly (uncoating) and
deliverance of the viral genome into the cellular nucleus remain unknown. Here,
we study (i) the formation of caveolae after viral infection and the diffusion of
caveosome vesicles in the cytoplasm and (ii) the capsid disassembly and the
mobility of the viral genome on its way to the nucleus, using fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy. To follow the viral genome and capsids separately, the 
histone components of SV40 minichromosomes were labelled with enhanced yellow
fluorescent protein and the capsid was labelled with a fluorescent red dye,
Alexa568. We characterized the diffusion of caveosomes, the capsid disassembly
process in the cytoplasm and the mobility of the viral genome in the nucleus,
using two kinds of permissive cells.
