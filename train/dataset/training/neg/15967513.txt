Endogenous retroviral sequences (ERVs) are dynamic genomic components with
profound influences on gene expression and genomic structure. Their extent of
expression is not well known. Several broadly targeted real-time reverse
transcription PCR (QPCRs) systems for surveillance of RNA expression of the major
groups of human gammaretroviral ERVs were constructed. The highly conserved
reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) domains of the pol gene were used
as targets for the PCRs, which were both probe-based (TaqMan) and probe-less
(SYBR Green). Different levels of primer and probe degeneracy, with or without
inosine, were tested. Several of the PCRs had sensitivities of a few HERV nucleic
acid copies per PCR reaction. Specificities were approximately as expected from
the fit of primers and probes. Gammaretroviral HERV RNA expression was studied in
different human tissues. Each HERV group had a specific pattern of expression.
HERV-E was highly expressed in testis, HERV-I/T in brain and testis, HERV-H in
brain and testis, while HERV-W was highly expressed in placenta. Gammaretroviral 
RNA was not detected in plasma from 50 blood donors in saliva from 20 persons. In
conclusion, a set of tools for investigation of gammaretroviral HERV RNA
expression was created.
