Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) selectively
induces carcinoma cell death through the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
Preclinical trials of gene therapy have been conducted using viral transfer of
the TRAIL transgene into prostate, bladder, breast, kidney, liver, non-small cell
lung cancer and also glioblastoma cells. Experiments in vitro demonstrated the
extensive apoptosis of target cells as well as frequent disease regression or
remission. TRAIL transfer did not show any side effects, opposite to
chemotherapy. Encouraging results of TRAIL-related gene therapy were observed in 
rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Adenoviral vectors (AdV) encoding TRAIL
are the most promising tool in anti-tumor therapy. They have undergone numerous
modifications by increasing transfection efficiency and transgene expression in
target cells. However, only one clinical phase I trial has been performed. AdV
encoding the TRAIL transgene caused local inflammation and apoptosis in patients 
with prostate cancer.
