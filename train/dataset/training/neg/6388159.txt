Detection and differentiation of small amounts of influenza A and B viruses was
done by enzyme-immunoassay based on detection of the complex of internal
proteins. It was shown that two kinds of sera to the complex of internal proteins
could be used: sera against disrupted viruses grown in a different system (mice
or cell culture) and containing almost no CAM component for virus detection in
the allantoic fluid of chick embryos, and sera to preparations of viruses grown
in chick embryos and disrupted with detergents for elimination of virion surface 
determinants (wastes of subunit vaccine) for virus detection in nasal secretions 
of vaccinated subjects. The test-systems containing antibodies to the complex of 
internal proteins were shown to be as sensitive and specific as those containing 
antibodies to pure M protein and RNP.
