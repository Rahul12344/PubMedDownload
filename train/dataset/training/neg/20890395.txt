The virological synapse (VS) is a tight adhesive junction between an HIV-infected
cell and an uninfected target cell, across which virus can be efficiently
transferred from cell to cell in the absence of cell-cell fusion. The VS has been
postulated to resemble, in its morphology, the well-studied immunological synapse
(IS). This review article discusses the structural similarities between IS and VS
and the shared T cell receptor (TCR) signaling components that are found in the
VS. However, the IS and the VS display distinct kinetics in disassembly and
intracellular signaling events, possibly leading to different biological
outcomes. Hence, HIV-1 exploits molecular components of IS and TCR signaling
machinery to trigger unique changes in cellular morphology, migration, and
activation that facilitate its transmission and cell-to-cell spread.
