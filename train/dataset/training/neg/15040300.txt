Monoclonal antibodies (MAs) to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from turnip
yellow luteovirus (TYV) were prepared using a recombinant protein as immunogen
and were shown to be directed to C-terminal part of the viral replicase. These
MAs were found to interact with a 70-kDa protein found in extracts from
TYV-infected plants. Our result is the first successful attempt at detecting the 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of a luteovirus in infected plant extracts. We also 
found that the protein is not processed further and its accumulation and content 
in the infected plant obey a definite dynamics during the infection. The English 
version of the paper: Russian Journal of Bioorganic Chemistry, 2004, vol. 30, no.
