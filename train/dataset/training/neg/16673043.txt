A baculoviral mammalian-cell vector was constructed to express Rta, a protein of 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) responsible for the transition from latent infection to 
lytic replication. EBV lytic replication and cell-growth inhibition was observed 
in infected D98/HR1 cells. The baculovirus caused little cytotoxicity in the
non-targeted HeLa cells, compared to an adenovirus vector. It is concluded that
recombinant baculovirus might have the potential as a vector for the therapy of
EBV-related cancer.
