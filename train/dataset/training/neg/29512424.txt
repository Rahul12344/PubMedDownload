The frequency of Chlamydia trachomatis infection among young infants admitted
with acute bronchiolitis was analysed to determine whether the former affects the
clinical course of the latter. A total of 92 infants aged <6 months admitted with
acute bronchiolitis were tested for C. trachomatis by a cell culture technique,
obtaining nasal smears from each infant's nostrils. A second nasal sampling was
taken for respiratory viruses from the study group and tested with real-time
polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characteristics of C. trachomatis-positive
and -negative cases were compared. C. trachomatis was detected in 22.8% of the
infants, mostly as coinfection with respiratory viral agents. Infection with C.
trachomatis affected the clinical outcome in acute bronchiolitis and such infants
tended to have severe bronchiolitis.
