The presence of morbillivirus-specific serum antibodies was examined by an
indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and virus neutralization
tests in serum samples from 30 dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), 8
long-snouted common dolphins (Delphinus capensis), 2 inshore and 6 offshore
bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and 20 Burmeister's porpoises (Phocoena 
spinipinnis) taken in fisheries off central Peru in 1993-1995. The sera from six 
dusky dolphins, one common dolphin and three offshore bottlenose dolphins were
positive on a coat of dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) antigen in the iELISA. Several 
of these sera were also positive when tested against peste des petits ruminants
and rinderpest virus antigen. Porpoise morbillivirus and/or DMV neutralizing
antibodies were detected in the sera of two bottlenose and three dusky dolphins
that reacted positively with DMV antigen in iELISA and also in the sera of one
common, one dusky and one bottlenose dolphin that were negative in the iELISA.
These results strongly suggest that viruses closely related, or identical, to the
cetacean morbillivirus present in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea
infect several species of Delphinidae of the Southeastern Pacific. No convincing 
morbillivirus-specific antibody positive reactions were detected in the sera from
either the Burmeister's porpoises or the inshore bottlenose dolphins.
