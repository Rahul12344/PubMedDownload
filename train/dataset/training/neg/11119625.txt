Dendritic cells are pivotal antigen-presenting cells for generating adaptive
T-cell responses. Here, we show that dendritic cells belonging to either the
myeloid-related or lymphoid-related subset are permissive for infection by mouse 
polyomavirus and, when loaded with a peptide corresponding to the immunodominant 
anti-polyomavirus CD8(+) T-cell epitope or infected by polyomavirus, are each
capable of driving expansion of primary polyomavirus-specific CD8(+) T-cell
responses in vivo.
