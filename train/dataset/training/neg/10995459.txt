Drug treatment of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection leads to a rapid initial decay of 
plasma virus followed by a slower second phase of decay. To investigate the role 
of HIV-1 retained on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in this process, we have
developed and analyzed a mathematical model for HIV-1 dynamics in lymphoid tissue
(LT) that includes FDCs. Analysis of clinical data using this model indicates
that decay of HIV-1 during therapy may be influenced by release of FDC-associated
virus. The biphasic character of viral decay can be explained by reversible
multivalent binding of HIV-1 to receptors on FDCs, indicating that the second
phase of decay is not necessarily caused by long-lived or latently infected
cells. Furthermore, viral clearance and death of short-lived productively
infected cells may be faster than previously estimated. The model, with
reasonable parameter values, is consistent with kinetic measurements of viral RNA
in plasma, viral RNA on FDCs, productively infected cells in LT, and CD4(+) T
cells in LT during therapy.
