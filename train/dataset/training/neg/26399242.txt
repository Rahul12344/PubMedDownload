Our knowledge of the lagomorph immune system remains largely based upon studies
of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a major model for studies of
immunology. Two important and devastating viral diseases, rabbit hemorrhagic
disease and myxomatosis, are affecting European rabbit populations. In this
context, we discuss the genetic diversity of the European rabbit immune system
and extend to available information about other lagomorphs. Regarding innate
immunity, we review the most recent advances in identifying interleukins,
chemokines and chemokine receptors, Toll-like receptors, antiviral proteins
(RIG-I and Trim5), and the genes encoding fucosyltransferases that are utilized
by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus as a portal for invading host respiratory and
gut epithelial cells. Evolutionary studies showed that several genes of innate
immunity are evolving by strong natural selection. Studies of the leporid CCR5
gene revealed a very dramatic change unique in mammals at the second
extracellular loop of CCR5 resulting from a gene conversion event with the
paralogous CCR2. For the adaptive immune system, we review genetic diversity at
the loci encoding antibody variable and constant regions, the major
histocompatibility complex (RLA) and T cells. Studies of IGHV and IGKC genes
expressed in leporids are two of the few examples of trans-species polymorphism
observed outside of the major histocompatibility complex. In addition, we review 
some endogenous viruses of lagomorph genomes, the importance of the European
rabbit as a model for human disease studies, and the anticipated role of
next-generation sequencing in extending knowledge of lagomorph immune systems and
their evolution.
