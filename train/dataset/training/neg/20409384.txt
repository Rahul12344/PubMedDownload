We report the arthropod-borne pediatric encephalitic agent La Crosse virus in
Aedes albopictus mosquitoes collected in Dallas County, Texas, USA, in August
2009. The presence of this virus in an invasive vector species within a region
that lies outside the virus's historically recognized geographic range is of
public health concern.
