Viral cancers show oncogene addiction to viral oncoproteins, which are required
for survival and proliferation of the dedifferentiated cancer cell. Human Merkel 
cell carcinomas (MCCs) that harbor a clonally integrated Merkel cell polyomavirus
(MCV) genome have low mutation burden and require viral T antigen expression for 
tumor growth. Here, we showed that MCV+ MCC cells cocultured with keratinocytes
undergo neuron-like differentiation with neurite outgrowth, secretory vesicle
accumulation, and the generation of sodium-dependent action potentials, hallmarks
of a neuronal cell lineage. Cocultured keratinocytes are essential for induction 
of the neuronal phenotype. Keratinocyte-conditioned medium was insufficient to
induce this phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that T antigen
knockdown inhibited cell cycle gene expression and reduced expression of key
Merkel cell lineage/MCC marker genes, including HES6, SOX2, ATOH1, and KRT20 Of
these, T antigen knockdown directly inhibited Sox2 and Atoh1 expression. MCV
large T up-regulated Sox2 through its retinoblastoma protein-inhibition domain,
which in turn activated Atoh1 expression. The knockdown of Sox2 in MCV+ MCCs
mimicked T antigen knockdown by inducing MCC cell growth arrest and neuron-like
differentiation. These results show Sox2-dependent conversion of an
undifferentiated, aggressive cancer cell to a differentiated neuron-like
phenotype and suggest that the ontology of MCC arises from a neuronal cell
precursor.
