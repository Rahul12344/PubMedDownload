BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are abundant in the circulation and play a central 
role in diverse biologic processes; they may be useful for early diagnosis of
hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: We conducted a two-phase, case-control study (20 pairs for the discovery
set and 49 pairs for the validation set) to test the hypothesis that genome-wide 
dysregulation of circulating miRNAs differentiates hepatocellular carcinoma cases
from controls. Taqman low-density arrays were used to examine genome-wide miRNA
expression for the discovery set, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to
validate candidate miRNAs for both discovery and validation sets.
RESULTS: Sixty-six miRNAs were found to be significantly overexpressed in plasma 
of hepatocellular carcinoma cases compared with controls after adjusting for
false discovery rate (P < 0.05). A volcano plot indicated that seven miRNAs had
greater than 2-fold case-control differences with P < 0.01. Four significant
miRNAs (miR-150, miR-30c, miR-483-5p, and miR-520b) detectable in all samples
with varied expression levels were further validated in a validation set.
MiR-483-5p was statistically significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular
carcinoma cases compared with controls (3.20 vs. 0.82, P < 0.0001).
Hepatocellular carcinoma risk factors and clinic-pathological characteristics did
not influence miR-483-5p expression. The combination of plasma miR-483-5p level
and hepatitis C virus status can significantly differentiate hepatocellular
carcinoma cases from controls with an area under the curve of 0.908 (P < 0.0001).
The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 75.5% and 89.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest the importance of dysregulated
circulating miR-483-5p as a potential hepatocellular carcinoma biomarker.
IMPACT: Confirmation of aberrant expression of miR-483-5p in a large prospective 
hepatocellular carcinoma study will provide support for its application to
hepatocellular carcinoma detection.
