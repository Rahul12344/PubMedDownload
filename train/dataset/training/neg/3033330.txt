Effects of cDNA hybridization on translation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA.

Cell-free translation of the RNA of encephalomyocarditis virus was examined after
hybridization of chemically synthesized cDNA fragments to different sites of the 
5' noncoding region of the viral RNA. The following results were obtained. The
binding of cDNA fragments to the first 41 nucleotides, to the poly(C) tract
(between nucleotides 149 and 263), and to the sequence between nucleotides 309
and 338 did not affect translation of the viral RNA; the binding of cDNA
fragments to the sequence between nucleotides 420 and 449 caused a slight
inhibition; and the binding of fragments to eight different sites between
nucleotides 450 and the initiator AUG codon (nucleotide 834) caused high degrees 
of inhibition. The results suggest that the first part of the 5' untranslated
region, at least to nucleotide 338, may not be required for encephalomyocarditis 
viral RNA translation; however, the region near nucleotide 450 is important for
translation of the viral RNA. The possibility that initiation occurs at an
internal site is discussed.
