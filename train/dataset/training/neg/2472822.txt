Both natural and recombinant interferons have shown definite antitumor activity
in some patients with some malignancies. The history of the development of
interferon as an antitumor agent is reviewed, with special attention to its use
in mice bearing 'spontaneously' appearing tumors and in mice injected with
tumorigenic viruses or transplantable tumor cells. Interferon can inhibit the
growth of primary tumors as well as the development of metastases. These
experimental results have provided some indications as to the probable optimal
regimens of interferon administration in man. Although the mechanisms of
interferon's antitumor activity are unknown, it seems likely that interferon can 
act directly on the tumor cells as well as on the tumor bearing host.
