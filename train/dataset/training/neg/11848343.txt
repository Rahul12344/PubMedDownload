Wastewater disinfection by ozone was investigated at pilot scale on different
wastewater effluents. Variations in operating conditions showed that a very low
hydraulic retention time (2 min) was sufficient for efficient fecal coliform
inactivation, provided a sufficient ozone dose was transferred to the effluent.
Therefore, the transferred ozone dose appeared to be the critical parameter for
the design of wastewater disinfection. As a consequence, the "Ct" approach
commonly applied in drinking water treatment should not be used for wastewater
ozonation. Design parameters of ozonation were proposed for two types of
regulations, and for effluents of different qualities. It was demonstrated that
only with an efficient filtration step one can meet stringent standards such as
the California Title 22 criteria. In all cases, viruses were totally inactivated;
consequently, viruses do not constitute a limiting factor in wastewater
disinfection by ozone. The standard drinking water model failed to match the
experimental data obtained on real wastewater effluents. A modified approach was 
successfully developed, based on the simultaneous consumption of ozone by the
microorganisms and the organic matrix.
