We retrospectively studied 89 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection, including 50 chronic hepatitis (CH) cases, 18 liver cirrhosis (LC)
cases, and 21 LC with hepatocellular carcinoma (LC + HCC) cases, with regard to
various factors related with thrombocytopenia. The platelet count decreased with 
the stage advancement of liver diseases. Multiple regression analysis revealed
that splenomegaly and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were explanatory variables that
correlated with thrombocytopenia. Splenomegaly appears to be the most responsible
factor, although there are a considerable number of thrombocytopenic cases
without splenomegaly, suggesting other factors may also be responsible. The vWF
level is inversely correlated with the platelet count. Soluble thrombomodulin, a 
marker of endothelial dysfunction, increases with the advancement of liver
fibrosis. It is positively correlated with vWF and inversely with the platelet
count. Our present results imply that vascular endothelial dysfunction is also
involved in thrombocytopenia during chronic HCV infection.
