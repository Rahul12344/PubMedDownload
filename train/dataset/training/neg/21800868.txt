MRI contrast agents providing very high relaxivity values can be obtained through
the attachment of multiple gadolinium(III) complexes to the interior surfaces of 
genome-free viral capsids. In previous studies, the contrast enhancement was
predicted to depend on the rigidity of the linker attaching the MRI agents to the
protein surface. To test this hypothesis, a new set of Gd-hydroxypyridonate based
MRI agents was prepared and attached to genetically introduced cysteine residues 
through flexible and rigid linkers. Greater contrast enhancements were seen for
MRI agents that were attached via rigid linkers, validating the design concept
and outlining a path for future improvements of nanoscale MRI contrast agents.
