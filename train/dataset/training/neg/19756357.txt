The polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) have recently been discovered in
specimens from patients with respiratory tract infections. To analyze the
frequency and clinical impact in a cohort of pediatric patients in a German
University Children's Hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar
lavage specimens of 229 children with acute respiratory tract infection were
screened for KIPyV and WUPyV using polymerase chain reaction-based methods. KIPyV
was detected in 2 (0.9%) and WUPyV in 1 (0.4%) patients, without co-infections
with other respiratory viruses but with co-detection of CMV, EBV and HHV 6 in one
immunocompromised patient. Only a very small proportion (1.3%) of positive
samples for KIPyV and WUPyV was documented in this study; the clinical relevance 
of these viruses remains unclear and requires further evaluation.
