Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus indigenous to Australia and
the Western Pacific region and is responsible for several thousand cases of human
RRV disease (RRVD) per annum. The disease primarily involves
polyarthritis/arthralgia, with many patients also presenting with rash, myalgia, 
fever, and/or lethargy. The symptoms can be debilitating at onset, but they
usually resolve within 3-6 months. Recent insights into the RRV-host
relationship, associated pathology, and molecular biology of infection have
generated a number of potential avenues for improved treatment. Although vaccine 
development has been proposed, the small market size and potential for
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease make this approach unattractive. 
Recent insights into the molecular basis of RRV-ADE and the virus's ability to
manipulate host inflammatory and immune responses create potential new
opportunities for therapeutic invention. Such interventions should overcome
virus-induced dysregulation of protective host responses to promote viral
clearance and/or ameliorate inflammatory immunopathology.
