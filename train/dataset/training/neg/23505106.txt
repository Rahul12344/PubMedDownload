OBJECTIVE: To investigate the optimal conditions of tri-expression of CYP3A4, POR
and cyt b5 in Sf 9 cells.
METHODS: The Sf 9 cells expressing CYP3A4, POR and cyt b5 were cultured in shaker
flasks. The optimized conditions, including the temperature and rotation speed,
the culture volume, the amount of surfactant and the culture time were studied.
The expressed products in microsomes were used to metabolize the testosterone and
their metabolic activity was determined.
RESULTS: When the temperature and rotation speed of the shaker were 27 degree and
90 r/min, the cell density and culture volume were 5X105 cells/ml and 80-120 ml
per 250 ml shaker flasks, respectively. When Pluronic F-68 was 0.1% and the
culture time was 72 h, the condition was most suitable for culture of Sf 9 cells 
and expression of targeted proteins. When the ratio of the volume of three added 
viruses was 1:1:1, the expression condition was optimal, under which the Km,
Vmax, and CLint for testosterone metabolism were 119.6 μmol/L,0.52 μmol/(min*g
protein) and 4.34 ml/(min*g protein), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The conditions of tri-expressing of CYP3A4, POR and cyt b5 have been 
optimized in the study and the product CYP3A4 is obtained with higher metabolic
activity.
