The U.S. agricultural sector is vulnerable to intentionally introduced microbial 
threats because of its wide and open distribution and economic importance. To
investigate such events, forensically valid assays for plant pathogen detection
are needed. In this work, real-time PCR assays were developed for three model
plant pathogens: Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato, Xylella fastidiosa, and
Wheat streak mosaic virus. Validation included determination of the linearity and
range, limit of detection, sensitivity, specificity, and exclusivity of each
assay. Additionally, positive control plasmids, distinguishable from native
signature by restriction enzyme digestion, were developed to support forensic
application of the assays. Each assay displayed linear amplification of target
nucleic acid, detected 100 fg or less of target nucleic acid, and was specific to
its target pathogen. Results obtained with these model pathogens provide the
framework for development and validation of similar assays for other plant
pathogens of high consequence.
