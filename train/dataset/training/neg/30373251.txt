Oncolytic virotherapy has been investigated for several decades and is emerging
as a plausible biological therapy with several ongoing clinical trials and two
viruses are now approved for cancer treatment in humans. The direct cytotoxicity 
and immune-stimulatory effects make oncolytic viruses an interesting strategy for
cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the results of in vitro and in
vivo published studies of oncolytic viruses in different phases of evaluation in 
dogs, using PubMed and Google scholar as search platforms, without time
restrictions (to date). Natural and genetically modified oncolytic viruses were
evaluated with some encouraging results. The most studied viruses to date are the
reovirus, myxoma virus, and vaccinia, tested mostly in solid tumors such as
osteosarcomas, mammary gland tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and mastocytomas.
Although the results are promising, there are issues that need addressing such as
ensuring tumor specificity, developing optimal dosing, circumventing preexisting 
antibodies from previous exposure or the development of antibodies during
treatment, and assuring a reasonable safety profile, all of which are required in
order to make this approach a successful therapy in dogs.
