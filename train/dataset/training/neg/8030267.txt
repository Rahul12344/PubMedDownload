The neurotropic virus JC (JCV) causes the demyelinating disease progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. JCV is transcriptionally regulated by both
positive and negative cis elements. Previous studies have shown that the
AGGGAAGGGA sequence, in isolation, interacts with a 53- to 56-kDa cellular
protein and acts as a silencer for the late promoter. We have reexamined the role
of the AGGGAAGGGA element in the glial cell-specific transcriptional regulation
of JCV by studying it in a longer natural context of elements of the JCV early
promoter. Transcriptional analysis in C6 glial cells of selectively mutated
AGGGAAGGGA domains within the nt 98-153 region of the JCV early promoter revealed
that both GGG regions in the AGGGAAGGGA sequence are required for glial
cell-specific transcription. The interactions of cellular proteins with the
AGGGAAGGGA domain were also found to be dependent upon the presence or absence of
neighboring cis elements. The TATA region was found to facilitate the interaction
of specific proteins with the AGGGAAGGGA domain. Domain-specific
photocrosslinking studies revealed the binding of a glial cell protein of
approximately 70-80 kDa to the AGGGAAAGGGA domain only when it was flanked by its
neighboring cis elements, the TATA and NF-1 domains of the JCV promoter.
