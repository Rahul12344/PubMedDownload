BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging arbovirus in Africa and
the Arabian Peninsula, in which infection with RVFV poses a serious threat to
humans and livestock globally. Approved treatments for RVFV infection, especially
for use in humans, have not yet been developed. There is an urgent need for
effective drugs to prevent RVFV disease.
METHODS: In previous study, we developed RVFV virus like particles (VLPs)
expressing the surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc. The morphology was shown to be
similar to live RVFV under electron microscopy. In this study, we immunized
horses with RVFV VLPs, prepared the immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments, and
characterized its in vitro neutralization and in vivo efficacy in mice.
RESULTS: F(ab')2 was found to potently neutralize RVFV in VeroE6 cells, and
passive transfer of immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments resulting in reduced
mortality in RVFV infected mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that passive immunotherapy with equine
immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments is a promising strategy to treat RVFV
infections.
