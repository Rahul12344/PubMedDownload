Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) plays an important role in infectious human 
morbidity, particularly in Russia and the Middle Urals. The Siberian subtype of
TBEV (S-TBEV) is dominant in the Middle Urals. Determining the origin of S-TBEV
strains in this territory and also in the European part of Russia and the Baltic 
countries is very important for understanding the cause of its distribution. The 
surface glycoprotein E gene was partially sequenced in 165 S-TBEV isolates
collected in the Middle Urals between 1966 and 2008. Nucleotide and amino acid
sequence identity of the studied isolates is 94 and 97.4 %, respectively. Eighty 
per cent of them are represented by six clusters with identical amino acid
sequences in the glycoprotein E fragment analysed. We have determined four types 
of isolate distribution in the explored territory: local, split, corridor and
diffuse. The average rate of nucleotide substitutions per site year(-1) is
estimated to be 1.56 x 10(-4). The age of the S-TBEV population was evaluated to 
be slightly less than 400 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the data and comparison
with historical events indicate that the distribution of S-TBEV strains in the
Middle Urals and the European part of Russia originated twice from different foci
in western Siberia. This is related to the first land road into Siberia and the
Trans-Siberian Way, which functioned at different times. The main reason for such
rapid distribution of S-TBEV strains is the anthropogenic factor, i.e. human
economic activity during the colonization of new territories in Siberia in the
recent past.
