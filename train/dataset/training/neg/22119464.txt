There is currently an unmet need for the development of small-molecule
therapeutics for norovirus infection. The piperazine scaffold, a privileged
structure embodied in many pharmacological agents, was used to synthesize an
array of structurally-diverse derivatives which were screened for anti-norovius
activity in a cell-based replicon system. The studies described herein
demonstrate for the first time that functionalized piperazine derivatives possess
anti-norovirus activity. Furthermore, these studies have led to the
identification of two promising compounds (6a and 9l) that can be used as a
launching pad for the optimization of potency, cytotoxicity, and drug-like
characteristics.
