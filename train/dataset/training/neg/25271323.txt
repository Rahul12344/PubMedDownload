Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are
human DNA tumor viruses that express nuclear antigens [latency-associated nuclear
antigen 1 (LANA1) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1)] necessary to
maintain and replicate the viral genome. We report here that both LANA1 and EBNA1
undergo highly efficient +1/-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting to generate
previously undescribed alternative reading frame (ARF) proteins in their repeat
regions. EBNA1(ARF) encodes a KSHV LANA-like glutamine- and glutamic acid-rich
protein, whereas KSHV LANA1(ARF) encodes a serine/arginine-like protein. Repeat
sequence recoding has not been described previously for human DNA viruses.
Programmed frameshifting (recoding) to generate multiple proteins from one RNA
sequence can increase the coding capacity of a virus, without incurring a
selective penalty against increased capsid size. The presence of similar repeat
sequences in cellular genes, such as huntingtin, suggests that a comparison of
repeat recoding in virus and human systems may provide functional and mechanistic
insights for both systems.
