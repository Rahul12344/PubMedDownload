This study examined changes in sexual behavior among Thai army conscripts from
1992 to 1998 in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
seroprevalence. The sexual behavior survey was started in 1992 during the
epidemic of HIV infection in Thailand, when sexual transmission was the most
common route and young men were at high risk, and it has continued yearly since
1995. The self-reported questionnaires were administered to randomly selected
conscripts (N = 294 in 1992, N > 4,000 in 1995-1998), and trends in sexual
behaviors were studied. The results showed that risky sexual behaviors generally 
decreased in relation to the decline in HIV seroprevalence, but the conscripts
still engage in risky sexual behaviors. Appropriate interventions should be
implemented to change these behaviors. The periodic sexual behavior surveys will 
be useful in evaluating program outcomes and planning for future interventions.
