Health care workers, especially surgeons, are frequently exposed to blood. Most
blood exposures are not reported. Blood exposures involve risk of contracting
serious infectious diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Fifty-four
cases of occupational transmission of HIV-virus have been reported world wide.
Occupational HIV-infection has not been reported in Denmark. Hepatitis B
infection can be prevented by vaccination, but there is no effective drug or
vaccine to prevent infection with hepatitis C and HIV-virus. Thus, the prevention
of occupationally transmitted infections should concentrate on the prevention of 
blood exposures. Further studies on occupational blood exposure among Danish
health care workers are needed.
