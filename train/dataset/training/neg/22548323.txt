The article summarises the results of more than 30 years of research on
palmitoylation (S-acylation) of viral proteins, the post-translational attachment
of fatty acids to cysteine residues of integral and peripheral membrane proteins.
Analysing viral proteins is not only important to characterise the cellular
pathogens but also instrumental to decipher the palmitoylation machinery of
cells. This comprehensive review describes methods to identify S-acylated
proteins and covers the fundamental biochemistry of palmitoylation: the location 
of palmitoylation sites in viral proteins, the fatty acid species found in
S-acylated proteins, the intracellular site of palmitoylation and the enzymology 
of the reaction. Finally, the functional consequences of palmitoylation are
discussed regarding binding of proteins to membranes or membrane rafts, entry of 
enveloped viruses into target cells by spike-mediated membrane fusion as well as 
assembly and release of virus particles from infected cells. The topics are
described mainly for palmitoylated proteins of influenza virus, but proteins of
other important pathogens, such as the causative agents of AIDS and severe acute 
respiratory syndrome, and of model viruses are discussed.
