CONTEXT: Violence against women is a global phenomenon that cuts across all
social and economic classes.
AIMS: This study was designed to measure the prevalence and correlates of
domestic violence (DV) among women seeking services at a voluntary counseling and
testing (VCT) center in Bangalore, India.
SETTINGS AND DESIGNS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among women visiting
an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) VCT center in Bangalore, between September 
and November 2005.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to
collect information about violence and other variables.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Univariable associations with DV were made using
Pearson Chi-squared test for categorical variables and Student t-test or the
Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.
RESULTS: Forty-two percent of respondents reported DV, including physical abuse
(29%), psychological abuse (69%) and sexual abuse (1%). Among the women who
reported violence of any kind, 67% also reported that they were HIV seropositive.
The most common reasons reported for DV included financial problems (38%),
husband's alcohol use (29%) and woman's HIV status (18%). Older women (P < 0.001)
and those with low income levels were the most likely to have experienced DV (P =
0.02). Other factors included husband's education, HIV seropositivity and alcohol
or tobacco use (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study found DV levels comparable to other studies from around
the world. The findings highlight the need for additional training among health
care providers in VCT centers in screening for DV, detection of signs of physical
abuse and provisions and referrals for women suffering from domestic partner
violence.
