Seven methods for the transfection of bacteria were compared and optimized for
use in Spiroplasma citri strain HP using the spiroplasma virus SpV1 R8A2 B
replicative form (RF). These methods included both chemical-mediated protocols
[CaCl2, RbCl/CaCl2, polyethylene glycol (PEG)], liposome-mediated transfection,
electroporation, freeze/thaw cycling, and natural competence. The best protocols 
were those which utilized PEG or electroporation, yielding transfection
frequencies of 1.4 x 10(-4) and 9.1 x 10(-4) transfectants/colony-forming unit
(CFU), respectively. For both of these protocols, transfection frequencies were
higher using CsCl-purified, covalently closed, circular DNA. In the PEG-mediated 
protocol, Sigma 8000 brand PEG at a final concentration of 44%, and the presence 
of carrier DNA proved to be optimal with a PEG exposure time of 2 min. Using
electroporation, a 1-2 ms pulse of a 6.5 kV/cm electric field was best; washing
the host cell pellet prior to electroporation enhanced efficiencies by 50%.
Linearization of the DNA resulted in lower transfection efficiencies by either
method.
