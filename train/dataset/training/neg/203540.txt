Screening of human brain tumors for SV40-related T antigen.

Tabuchi K, Kirsch WM, Low M, Gaskin D, Van Buskirk J, Maa S.

A series of 39 human brain tumors has been screened for the presence or absence
of SV40-related T antigen by the direct and indirect immunoperoxidase methods.
Two tumors of ependymal origin (malignant ependymoma, choroid plexus papilloma)
revealed markedly positive nuclear staining for T antigen both in vivo and in
vitro. The relationship of these tumors to their experimental counterparts
inducible by recent human papovavirus isolates is discussed.
