This study reports a novel HIV-1 recombinant virus (GX2016EU10) isolated from a
24-year-old man, who was infected by homosexual sex in Guangxi, China. The near
full-length genome analyses showed GX2016EU10 kept the CRF07_BC parental backbone
with three CRF01_AE segments inserted into gag, pol, vpu, env, and nef genes,
respectively. The recombinant breakpoints were completely different from the
other CRF01_AE/CRF07_BC recombinant forms reported. GX2016EU10 was CCR5-tropic
through GHOST cell identification. The emergence of GX2016EU10 indicates that the
HIV-1 epidemic among men who have sex with men in Guangxi is increasing in
complexity, which poses a serious challenge to prevention and control.
