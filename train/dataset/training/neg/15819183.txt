Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are all preventable but infectious diseases
caused by viruses. A particular study by Wakefield et al suggests that there are 
potentially adverse effects of having the triple MMR vaccine. This has been
reported widely by the media and has caused alarm to parents of young children,
probably contributing to the decline in its uptake. In order to provide the
context for the debate regarding the single versus the triple vaccine, this paper
briefly appraises firstly, the Wakefield et al research paper that has led to
public health concerns and secondly, a more rigorous research study (Madsen et
al) that contradicts the findings; the paper then explores the risks and benefits
of the single and the triple MMR vaccine programmes, finally providing a short
discussion on factors that might influence the decision-making process by parents
when faced with the dilemma of not having their child vaccinated, or opting for
either the single or triple vaccination programme.
