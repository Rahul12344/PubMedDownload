Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein is necessary for H-2-restricted lysis of 
infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Hale AH, Witte ON, Baltimore D, Eisen HN.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) elicited cytotoxic thymus-derived lymphocytes
(CTLs) in mice of the BALB/c and three congenic strains (BALB.b, BALB.k,
BALB.HTG). CTL lysis of VSV-infected fibroblasts from the four strains was
restricted by the target cells' major histocompatibility complex (H-2). Target
cells were also infected with two temperature-sensitive mutants of VSV, tsM and
tsG in which, respectively, the viral matrix protein and glycoprotein are not
expressed at 39 degrees (restrictive temperature) on the infected cell's surface 
membrane. At the restrictive temperature, cells infected with wild-type VSV or
tsM were lysed by CTLs, but cells infected with tsG were not. The requirement for
the glycoprotein on the target cell was also evident from the ability of antisera
to the glycoprotein to block completely CTL lysis of VSV-infected cells.
