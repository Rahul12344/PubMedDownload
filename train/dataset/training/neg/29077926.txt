Objectives: To evaluate, in a clinical cohort of HIV-1-infected patients, the
prevalence of PI minority resistant variants (MRV) at ART baseline and their
impact on the virological response to a first-line PI-based regimen.
Patients and methods: In an observational single-centre cohort, we assessed all
ART-naive patients initiating a first-line regimen including two NRTI and one
boosted PI, darunavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir, between January 2012 and
March 2015. Ultra-deep sequencing of the pol gene was performed using Illumina®
technology. Protease mutations were identified using the WHO transmitted drug
resistance list and major PI resistance mutations (IAS-USA drug resistance
mutations list).
Results: Ninety-four and 16 patients initiating a darunavir/ritonavir-based
regimen and an atazanavir/ritonavir-based regimen, respectively, were assessed.
Twenty-eight percent of the patients were HIV-1 subtype B, 39% CRF02_AG and 33%
other non-B subtypes. Thirteen patients (13.8%) in the darunavir group and three 
patients (18.8%) in the atazanavir group experienced a virological failure (VF). 
Overall, 13 (11.8%) subjects had PI MRV at baseline in the median proportion of
1.3% (IQR = 1.1-1.7). The most prevalent PI MRV were G73C (n = 5) and M46I
(n = 3). The proportion of patients harbouring baseline PI MRV was similar
between those with virological success (10.6%) and those experiencing VF (18.8%) 
(P = 0.40). No difference was observed in the rate of PI MRV by viral subtype
(P = 0.51) or by PI drug (P = 0.40).
Conclusions: This study showed a prevalence of 11.8% of PI MRV among 110
ART-naive subjects, without significant impact on the virological response to a
first-line PI-based regimen containing darunavir or atazanavir.
