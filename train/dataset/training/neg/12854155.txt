AIM: To investigate whether the formation of aggregated HBx has a potential
linking with its cellular responses.
METHODS: Recombinant HBx was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA
metal-affinity chromatography. Anti-HBx monoclonal antibody was developed for
immunocytochemical detection. Bicistronic expression vector harboring full-length
DNA of HBx was employed for transfection of human HepG2 cells. Immunocytochemical
staining was used to examine the intracellular HBx aggregates in cells. The
effects of HBx aggregation on cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: Immunocytochemical staining revealed most of the HBx was formed
intracellular aggregate in cytoplasm and frequently accumulated in large
granules. Flow cytometry analysis showed that HepG2 cells transfected with vector
harboring HBx significantly increased apoptosis and largely accumulated in the
G0-G1 phase by maintenance in serum medium for 36 hours. Control cells without
HBx aggregates in the presence of serum entered S phase and proliferated more
rapidly at the same time. EGFP fluorescence in HBx expression cells was
significantly decreased.
CONCLUSION: Our observations show that cells with HBx aggregate undergo growth
arrest and apoptosis, whereas control cells without HBx remain in growth and
progression into S phase. Our data may provide helpful information to understand 
the biological effects of HBx aggregates on cells.
