Ano-genital warts are in general considered as benign lesions, as they are mostly
caused by the non-oncogenic HPV types 6 and 11. In this review, there is a focus 
on the problematic issues, that these lesions and their treatments can cause.
Both topical and ablative treatments are associated with side effects, and the
varying effect of the treatments combined with an uncertain timeline to clearance
are known to cause psychological distress. Vaccination against HPV-6 and -11 has 
been shown to reduce the incidence of this troublesome infection substantially in
both women and men in countries with high vaccine coverage.
