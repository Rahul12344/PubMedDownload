Binding('tagging') of a virus-specific oligonucleotide 'sticker' to RNA
transcripts copied from PCR products caused retardation of transcript mobility in
gel. This enables detection of specific sequences within the RNA transcripts, and
a virus strain (PVY(NTN)) could thus be positively identified. We have
demonstrated further that oligonucleotides that contained virus sequences
originated from different genomic locations varied in their inhibitory effect on 
the rate of transcript migration in gel; thus, the most effective oligonucleotide
could be chosen. Combinations of different strain-specific oligonucleotides had
additive retarding effects on transcript migration. The conditions for annealing 
oligonucleotides to the RNA transcripts were studied, including concentrations of
oligonucleotides and salt. A higher electrophoresis temperature (up to 45 degrees
C) reduced the gel retardation phenomena, which indicated a conformation
mechanism. The applicability of 'tagging' of RNA transcripts with a
strain-specific oligonucleotide for virus strain differentiation is discussed.
