Vaccinia virus dissemination relies on the recruitment of the nucleation
promoting factor N-WASP underneath cell-associated extracellular virus (CEVs) and
subsequent recruitment and activation of the ARP2/3 complex, a major actin
nucleator of the host cell. We have recently discovered that, in addition to the 
N-WASP/ARP2/3 pathway, vaccinia actin-based motility also relies on the small
GTPase Rac1 and its downstream effector the formin-type actin nucleator FHOD1.
Here we discuss the potential signaling mechanisms supporting the integration of 
the N-WASP/ARP2/3 and Rac1/FHOD1 pathways. We suggest the existence of a receptor
tyrosine kinase family member that would integrate the Src-dependent activation
of the N-WASP/ARP2/3 pathway and the GTP exchange factor-dependent activation of 
the Rac1/FHOD1 pathway.
