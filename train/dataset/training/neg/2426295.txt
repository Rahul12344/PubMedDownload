Use of gold IgG complexes and human antisera for electron microscopic
identification of hepatitis A virus and polioviruses.

Kjeldsberg E.

An indirect immunogold staining technique was used for identification of
hepatitis A virus and poliovirus types 1,2 and 3 by electron microscopy. Human
convalescent antisera against hepatitis A virus and the three poliovirus types
were used as primary antibodies and goat anti-human IgG gold complexes, with an
approximate gold granule size of 15 nm, as secondary antibody. Hepatitis A virus 
was specifically labelled with the homologous antiserum. No labelling was
observed when antiserum against poliovirus or other negative control sera were
used as primary antibody. Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were specifically labelled 
with a human serum with high titres of antibody against all three virus types.
The use of type-specific antisera made it possible to distinguish types 1, 2 and 
3 from each other, although slight cross-reactions occurred. The results indicate
that gold IgG complexes in conjunction with human antisera may be used for
identification of small spherical viruses.
