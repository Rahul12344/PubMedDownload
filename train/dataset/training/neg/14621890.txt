The presence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome in spleen tissue was studied 
by using DNA hybridization techniques in seropositive and seronegative organ
donors without clinical or laboratory confirmed HCMV infection. The serum samples
of these patients were screened by latex agglutination test (LA) and enzyme
linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of HCMV antibodies, and
confirmed by immunoblotting technique (IB). For the detection of HCMV sequences
in spleen tissue dot blot DNA hybridization (DBH) using probes derived from
immediate-early and late regions (ES and BH fragment respectively) of the HCMV
genome were used. Samples positive in DBH were further tested by in situ DNA
hybridization (ISH) using the ES probe. The number of spleen tissue specimens
positive for HCMV nucleic acids indicated that HCMV may be present in human
beings, even without serological evidence.
