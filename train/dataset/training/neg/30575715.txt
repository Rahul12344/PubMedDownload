Newly-emerged and vaccine-mismatched influenza A viruses (IAVs) result in a rapid
global spread of the virus due to minimal antibody-mediated immunity. In that
case, established CD8+ T-cells can reduce disease severity. However, as mutations
occur sporadically within immunogenic IAV-derived T-cell peptides, understanding 
of T-cell receptor (TCRαβ) cross-reactivity towards IAV variants is needed for a 
vaccine design. Here, we investigate TCRαβ cross-strain recognition across IAV
variants within two immunodominant human IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes,
HLA-B*37:01-restricted NP338-346 (B37-NP338) and HLA-A*01:01-restricted NP44-52
(A1-NP44). We find high abundance of cross-reactive TCRαβ clonotypes recognizing 
distinct IAV variants. Structures of the wild-type and variant peptides revealed 
preserved conformation of the bound peptides. Structures of a cross-reactive
TCR-HLA-B37-NP338 complex suggest that the conserved conformation of the variants
underpins TCR cross-reactivity. Overall, cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell responses,
underpinned by conserved epitope structure, facilitates recognition of distinct
IAV variants, thus CD8+ T-cell-targeted vaccines could provide protection across 
different IAV strains.
