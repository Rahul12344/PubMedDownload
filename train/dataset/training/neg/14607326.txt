From an ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the exudate obtained from the stems of 
Angelica keiskei (Umbelliferae), 17 compounds, viz. five chalcones (1-5), seven
coumarins (6-12), three flavanones (13-15), one diacetylene (16), and one
5-alkylresorcinol (17), were isolated. These compounds were evaluated with
respect to their inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early 
antigen (EBV-EA) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells,
which is known to be a primary screening test for antitumor-promoters. With the
exception of three compounds (10, 16, and 17), all other compounds tested showed 
potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction (92-100% inhibition at 1x10(3)mol
ratio/TPA). In addition, upon evaluation of these compounds for the inhibitory
effects against activation of
(+/-)-(E)-methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxy-imino]-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexemide (NOR 1), a
nitric oxide (NO) donor, as a primary screening test for antitumor-initiators,
two chalcones (2 and 3) and six coumarins (6-11) exhibited potent inhibitory
effects.
