The coxsackie B virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily. In addition to activity as a viral receptor, it may
play a role in cellular adhesion. We asked what determines the cell membrane
microdomain of CAR. We found that CAR is localized to a novel lipid-rich
microdomain similar to that of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) but
distinct from that of a CAR variant that exhibited traditional lipid raft
localization via fusion to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail. The
cytoplasmic tail determines its membrane localization, since deletion of this
domain resulted in mislocalization. Results indicate that CAR, CAR-LDLR, and LDLR
reside in a novel lipid raft that is distinct from caveolin-1-containing caveolae
and GPI-linked proteins. Residence in a lipid-rich domain provides a mechanism
that allows CAR to interact with other cell adhesion proteins and yet function as
an adenovirus receptor.
