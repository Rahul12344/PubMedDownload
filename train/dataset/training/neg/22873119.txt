The regulation of cancerous tumor development is converged upon by multiple
pathways and factors. Besides environmental factors, gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
cancer can be caused by chronic inflammation, which is generally induced by
bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The role of these inducers in cancer
development, cell differentiation and transformation, cell cycle deregulation,
and in the expression of tumor-associated genes cannot be ignored. Although
Helicobacter pylori activates many oncogenic pathways, particularly those in
gastric and colorectal cancers, the role of viruses in tumor development is also 
significant. Viruses possess significant oncogenic potential to interfere with
normal cell cycle control and genome stability, stimulating the growth of
deregulated cells. An increasing amount of recent data also implies the
association of GI cancers with bacterial colonization and viruses. This review
focuses on host-cell interactions that facilitate primary mechanisms of
tumorigenesis and provides new insights into novel GI cancer treatments.
