Infectious agents, such as herpesviruses, have been hypothesized to be involved
in development of atheromatous plaque. The study aim was to evaluate the
possibility that HHV-8 infection could be an additional risk factor for the
establishment of cardiovascular disease. HHV-8 seroprevalence was determined by
immunofluorescence in a population of cardiovascular disease patients (n=50) as
compared to an age- and sex-matched group of control subjects (n=47); HHV-8
genome was detected in DNA extracted from circulating PBMC and from atheromatous 
lesions by PCR with primers specific for the minor virus capsid gene (ORF 26).
The seroprevalence of HHV-8 was significantly increased in the patients as
compared to the control population, while the presence of HHV-8 genome was
observed in PBMC from 2 patients and 1 control. Virus-specific DNA was found in 2
out of 4 atheromatous plaques. The higher seroprevalence in patients suffering
from vascular diseases as compared to age-and sex-matched controls suggests that 
HHV-8 infection could be an additional risk factor for the establishment of
cardiovascular disease, although the data on the persistence of viral DNA in PBMC
or in the arterial lesions are too exiguous to definitively support this
hypothesis. More extensive studies are needed to define the exact role of HHV-8
infection in the establishment and progression of atheromatous lesions.
