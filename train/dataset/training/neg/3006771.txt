Protein blot analysis of virus receptors: identification and characterization of 
the Sendai virus receptor.

Gershoni JM, Lapidot M, Zakai N, Loyter A.

Receptors for Sendai virions in human erythrocyte ghost membranes were identified
by virus overlay of protein blots. Among the various erythrocyte polypeptides,
only glycophorin was able to bind Sendai virions effectively. The detection of
Sendai virions bound to glycophorin was accomplished either by employing
anti-Sendai virus antibodies or by autoradiography, when 125I-labeled Sendai
virions were used. The binding activity was associated with the viral
hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein, as inferred from the observation
that the binding pattern of purified HN glycoprotein to human erythrocyte
membranes was identical to that of intact Sendai virions. No binding was observed
when blots, containing either human erythrocyte membranes or purified
glycophorin, were probed with the viral fusion factor (F glycoprotein). Active
virions competed effectively with the binding of 125I-labeled Sendai virions (or 
purified HN glycoprotein), whereas no competition was observed with inactivated
Sendai virus. The results of the present work clearly show that protein blotting 
can be used to identify virus receptors in cell membrane preparations.
