BACKGROUND: A group A Streptococcus (GAS) lineage of genotype emm3, sequence type
15 (ST15) was associated with a 6 month upsurge in invasive GAS disease in the
UK. The epidemic lineage (Lineage C) had lost 2 typical emm3 prophages, Φ315.1
and Φ315.2 associated with the superantigen ssa, but gained a different prophage 
(ΦUK-M3.1) associated with a different superantigen, speC and a DNAse spd1.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of speC and spd1 in Lineage C ST15 strains
enhanced both in vitro mitogenic and DNase activities over non-Lineage C ST15
strains. Invasive disease models in Galleria mellonella and SPEC-sensitive
transgenic mice, revealed no difference in overall invasiveness of Lineage C ST15
strains compared with non-Lineage C ST15 strains, consistent with clinical and
epidemiological analysis. Lineage C strains did however markedly prolong murine
nasal infection with enhanced nasal and airborne shedding compared with
non-Lineage C strains. Deletion of speC or spd1 in 2 Lineage C strains identified
a possible role for spd1 in airborne shedding from the murine nasopharynx.
CONCLUSIONS: Nasopharyngeal infection and shedding of Lineage C strains was
enhanced compared with non-Lineage C strains and this was, in part, mediated by
the gain of the DNase spd1 through prophage acquisition.
