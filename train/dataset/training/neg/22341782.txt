Inflammatory cytokines have a significant role in altering the innate and
adaptive arms of immune responses. Here, we analyzed the effect of GM-CSF on a
RABV-vaccine vector co-expressing HIV-1 Gag. To this end, we immunized mice with 
RABV expressing HIV-1 Gag and GM-CSF and analyzed the primary and recall CD8(+) T
cell responses. We observed a statistically significant increase in antigen
presenting cells (APCs) in the spleen and draining lymph nodes in response to
GM-CSF. Despite the increase in APCs, the primary and memory anti HIV-1 CD8(+) T 
cell response was significantly lower. This was partly likely due to lower levels
of proliferation in the spleen. Animals treated with GM-CSF neutralizing
antibodies restored the CD8(+) T cell response. These data define a role of
GM-CSF expression, in the regulation of the CD8(+) T cell immune responses
against RABV and has implications in the use of GM-CSF as a molecular adjuvant in
vaccine development.
