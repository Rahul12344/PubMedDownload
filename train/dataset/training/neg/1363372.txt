The evaluation of the presence of p24 antigen on the membrane of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from 31 HIV infected individuals is presented. The study was
performed by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry and the data were
analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Values obtained [D/s(n)] result from the
comparison of the fluorescence histograms of each sample with a control one.
Cases showing p24 Ag on peripheral blood mononuclear cells also presented
percentages of CD3, HLA-DR positive cells significantly higher than p24 negative 
ones. In addition, D/s(n) values were superior in symptomatic patients than in
asymptomatic ones, which indicate the existence of a correlation between flow
cytometry results, viral replication and clinical course. Nevertheless in this
study, as well and in previous ones, a high degree of cross reactivity between
the anti-p24 monoclonal antibody employed and normal lymphocytes has been
observed. This reactivity is localized preferentially in the CD4 positive subset.
