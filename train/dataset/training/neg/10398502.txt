The development of new virus inactivation procedures has become an area of
growing interest mainly due to increased demands concerning the safety of
biological products. Photochemical processes represent the most promising methods
for the future to inactivate viruses. In these methods, dyes are the most widely 
used photosensitising reagents. The current article covers a new interesting
alternative, namely the use of buckminsterfullerene (C60). The unique properties 
of this molecule make it a valid candidate for future applications in the
inactivation of viruses in biological fluids. Copyright 1998 John Wiley & Sons,
