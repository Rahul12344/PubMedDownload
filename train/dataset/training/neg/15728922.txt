Zinc salt solutions administered as topical microbicides provided significant
protection against herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in a mouse vaginal
challenge model. However, at the therapeutic concentration, the salt solutions
caused sloughing of sheets of vaginal epithelial cells. These observations limit 
the utility of zinc salts as microbicides and suggest that the application of
zinc solutions to mucosal surfaces has the potential to cause damage that might
increase susceptibility to secondary infections at a later time.
