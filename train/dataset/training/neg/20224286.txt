BACKGROUND: alpha-Synuclein (AS) is an abundant neuronal protein predominantly
localized in presynaptic terminals in the central nervous system. AS aggregation 
is a molecular hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including
Parkinson's disease, and is thought to play a significant role in the etiology of
the disease. Recent experimental evidence indicates that AS exists in two forms, 
a membrane-bound form and a disordered cytosolic form. Much effort is dedicated
to prevent and dissolve AS aggregates, specifically AS oligomers and
protofibrils, which are thought to be the more toxic form of aggregates.
METHODS: The effect of filamentous phages on AS aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells
overexpressing wild-type AS was quantified in ELISA designed to detect and
quantify AS oligomers.
RESULTS: We found reduced levels of AS oligomers in the membrane fraction in
cells treated with filamentous phages compared to nontreated cells.
CONCLUSION: The reduction in AS oligomers from the plasma membrane in treated
cells may suggest further therapeutic application.
