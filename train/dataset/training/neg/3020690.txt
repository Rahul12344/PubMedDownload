Neuroleukin: a lymphokine product of lectin-stimulated T cells.

Gurney ME, Apatoff BR, Spear GT, Baumel MJ, Antel JP, Bania MB, Reder AT.

Neuroleukin is a lymphokine product of lectin-stimulated T cells that induces
immunoglobulin secretion by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Neuroleukin acts early in the in vitro response that leads to formation of
antibody-secreting cells, but continued production of immunoglobulin by
differentiated antibody-secreting cells is neuroleukin-independent. Although the 
factor is not directly mitogenic, cellular proliferation is a late component of
the response to neuroleukin. Neuroleukin does not have B-cell growth factor
(BCGF) or B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF) activity in defined assays.
Neuroleukin-evoked induction of immunoglobulin secretion is both monocyte- and
T-cell-dependent.
