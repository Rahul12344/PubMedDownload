The considerable morbidity and mortality associated with certain human
papillomaviruses (HPV) has provided the impetus for HPV vaccine development. The 
design of such vaccines has evolved from an understanding of the nature of HPV
infections and their consequences, together with evaluation of the efficacy of
different approaches to vaccination in animal models. These studies have
culminated in the production of several different vaccine preparations which are 
currently undergoing Phase I and II clinical trials. The justification for the
widespread implementation of prophylactic HPV vaccines will depend on the outcome
of larger scale studies of vaccine efficacy that take into account the
epidemiology of HPV infections and associated disease. The usefulness of
therapeutic HPV vaccines will require evidence that they can substantially
augment or substitute for the effectiveness of currently available treatments.
