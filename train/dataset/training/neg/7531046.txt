New developments concerning the diagnostic of virus-transmitted diseases led to a
strong improvement of virus security in hemotherapy. The introduction of
additional virus antigens associated with the core region of the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) resulted in an increase of sensitivity and especially of specificity 
of second-generation enzyme immuno assays (EIAs). The recombinant immunoblot
(RIBA) with 4 synthetic antigens continues to be the most accepted confirmatory
test in the field of HCV diagnostic. Beside the simultaneous detection of
specific IgG and IgM, especially the HIV-p24 antigen test is discussed concerning
HIV-1, -2 diagnostic in order to shorten the 'windows period' in the early time
of infection. It is assumed that the HIV-p24 antigen test is not able to
effectively improve virus security in areas with low HIV-1, -2 prevalence.
