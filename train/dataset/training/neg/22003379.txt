The emerging field of paleovirology aims to study the evolutionary age and impact
of ancient viruses (paleoviruses) on host biology. Despite a historical emphasis 
on retroviruses, paleoviral 'fossils' have recently been uncovered from a broad
swathe of viruses. These viral imprints have upended long-held notions of the age
and mutation rate of viruses. While 'direct' paleovirology relies on the
insertion of viral genes in animal genomes, examination of adaptive changes in
host genes that occurred in response to paleoviral infections provides a
complementary strategy for making 'indirect' paleovirological inferences.
Finally, viruses have also impacted host biology by providing genes hosts have
domesticated for their own purpose.
