Protease induced by ultraviolet rays (UV) has been extensively investigated in
human cells. Plasminogen activator-like protease (PA) activity was induced soon
after UV irradiation in peripheral lymphocytes derived from healthy donors. In
contrast, UV-irradiated lymphocytes derived from Cockayne syndrome (CS) cases did
not show marked protease inducibility. Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-transformed CS
lymphoblastoid cells were also characterized by insusceptibility to UV-induction 
of PA. However, when CS-derived cells were treated with a human interferon
(HuIFN) preparation prior to irradiation, induction of PA activity was detected, 
irrespective of the kind of HuIFN (alpha or gamma). The results indicate the
possibility of abnormal PA metabolism in CS-derived cells.
