Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes induction of
several tumors/cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and is known to be a major risk
factor for development of HCC. Therefore, drugs that simultaneously target viral 
replication and CSC properties are needed for a risk-free treatment of advanced
stage liver diseases, including HCC. Here, we demonstrated that
(Z)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (Z-TMS) exhibits potent antitumor and anti-HCV
activities without exhibiting cytotoxicity to human hepatocytes in vitro or in
mice livers. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) extensively
induced expression of DCLK1 (a CSC marker) in the livers of C57BL/6 mice
following hepatic injury. Z-TMS exhibited hepatoprotective effects against
DEN/CCl4-induced injury by reducing DCLK1 expression and improving histologic
outcomes. The drug caused bundling of DCLK1 with microtubules and blocked
cell-cycle progression at G2-M phase in hepatoma cells via downregulation of
CDK1, induction of p21(cip1/waf1) expression, and inhibition of Akt (Ser(473))
phosphorylation. Z-TMS also inhibited proliferation of erlotinib-resistant lung
adenocarcinoma cells (H1975) bearing the T790M EGFR mutation, most likely by
promoting autophagy and nuclear fragmentation. In conclusion, Z-TMS appears to be
a unique therapeutic agent targeting HCV and concurrently eliminating cells with 
neoplastic potential during chronic liver diseases, including HCC. It may also be
a valuable drug for targeting drug-resistant carcinomas and cancers of the lungs,
pancreas, colon, and intestine, in which DCLK1 is involved in tumorigenesis.
