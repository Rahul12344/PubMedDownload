Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a unique capability to image
high-resolution architecture and structural dynamics of pathogens (e.g., viruses,
bacteria, and bacterial spores) at near-molecular resolution in native
conditions. Further development of atomic force microscopy to enable the
correlation of pathogen protein surface structures with specific gene products is
essential to understand the mechanisms of the pathogen life cycle. We applied an 
AFM-based immunolabeling technique for the proteomic mapping of macromolecular
structures through the visualization of the binding of antibodies, conjugated
with nanogold particles, to specific epitopes on Bacillus spore surfaces. This
information is generated while simultaneously acquiring the surface morphology of
the pathogen. The immunospecificity of this labeling method was established
through the utilization of specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that
target spore coat and exosporium epitopes of Bacillus atrophaeus and Bacillus
anthracis spores.
