Interferon production by mammalian cells grown in a serum-free medium.

Pumper RW, Molander L.

Interferon, produced by rabbit heart cells grown in a serum-free medium, failed
to protect rabbit heart serum-free cells, but protected rabbit heart
serum-containing-medium cells against vaccinia and vesicular stomatitis virus.
Interferon produced in serum-free cells had a greater species specificity than
that produced in serum-containing media. The difference in activity was shown to 
be due to lack of adsorption by serum-free-medium cells.
