We have investigated the time course after infection in coxsackievirus B3 murine 
myocarditis to determine the extent (if any) of persistent or latent infection
that might be responsible for recurrence. We employed a polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) method that can detect an extremely small amount of genome by amplification
techniques in four-week-old BALD/c mice (n = 140) infected with coxsackievirus B3
by a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 x 10(4) plaque-forming units
(PFU)/mouse (Group 1) and 1 x 10(2) PFU/mouse (Group 2). Mice were sacrificed on 
days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28, and their hearts were resected for RNA
extraction. Single chain DNA was synthesized from 1 microgram of RNA and the
viral genome was amplified by PCR. The virus genome was strongly amplified in
Group 1 from days 3 to 10, and in Group 2 from days 5 to 7, but afterwards both
amplifications rapidly diminished. However, a positive signal, though very faint,
persisted in both groups until day 28, by which time all histological evidence of
myocarditis had disappeared in Group 2. Our results demonstrated that there was
persistent or latent virus infection in the myocardium throughout the entire
study period of 28 days. Such persistence might provide a pathomechanism for the 
exacerbation and recurrence of myocarditis.
