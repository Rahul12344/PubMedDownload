BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection is associated with a more
severe outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB); however, little is
known about the presence of HDV in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to determine the 
prevalence of HDV infection, as well as its clinical, biological and virological 
characteristics, in a large CHB cohort in Ethiopia.
METHODS: In total, 1267 HIV-negative CHB patients at St. Paul's Hospital
Millennium Medical College in Addis Ababa were screened for anti-HDV antibodies
using ELISA assays. Confirmed positive samples were further tested for HDV RNA
using a consensus commercial real-time RT-PCR assay. HDV genotypes were also
determined for RNA-positive samples by nucleotide sequencing followed by
phylogenetic analyses. Demographical, clinical and biological data from patients 
were recorded and compared based on HDV RNA results.
RESULTS: Most patients (n = 748, 59.0%) were men, and the median age was 31 years
(interquartile range 26-40). Anti-HDV antibodies were detected in 19 individuals 
(1.5%), 12 of whom were HDV RNA-positive with a viral load ranging from <2 to >8 
log 10 IU/mL. All strains were genotype 1. HDV RNA-positive patients were more
likely to have significant liver fibrosis (63.6% vs 24.7%, P = .007) and
cirrhosis (45.5% vs 16.4%, P = .024).
CONCLUSIONS: HDV infection is rare in Ethiopia but is associated with more
advanced liver fibrosis.
