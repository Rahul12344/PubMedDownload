The effects of transfer of the movement gene between the tobamoviruses tobacco
mosaic virus (TMV) and tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) were studied. The 
movement protein (MP) gene of TMGMV was cloned into an infectious cDNA of TMV to 
build the recombinant virus V23. V23, like TMV and TMGMV, caused systemic
infection in Nicotiana tabacum Xanthi. In N. sylvestris V23 and TMV spread
systemically although TMGMV produces necrotic local lesions on this host. V23 and
TMV cause systemic infection on tomato plants while TMGMV does not infect tomato.
In Xanthi nc plants, V23 produced necrotic local lesions similar in size to those
produced by TMGMV. On the other hand in transgenic Xanthi nc tobacco plants that 
express a gene encoding the MP of TMV the necrotic lesions produced by V23 and
TMGMV were similar in size to those produced by TMV. These results indicate that 
the size of necrotic lesions produced by TMGMV and TMV on Xanthi nc plants is
influenced by the MP gene.
