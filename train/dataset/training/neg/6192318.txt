Evidence for the contribution of the host species to the extent of antigenic
variation of N1 influenza virus neuraminidase.

Maywald F, Bosch FX, Orlich M, Rott R.

N1 influenza virus neuraminidases (NA) derived from avian, swine and human virus 
isolates, including the genetically related classic strains A/FPV/Rostock/34,
A/Swine/1976/31, A/PR8/34 and A/FM1/47, were analysed serologically by
neuraminidase inhibition (NI), inhibition of virus release (IVR) and competitive 
radio-immunoassays (competitive RIA). Comparing the three tests, competitive RIA 
appeared to be more reliable than NI and IVR for a quantitative assessment of
antigenic relatedness. Together with evidence presented by others, these studies 
indicate that the host species contributes to the extent of antigenic variation
of NAses. In contrast to NAses of human viruses where antigenic drift occurs
readily, NAses of animal influenza viruses, from birds or mammalians, undergo far
fewer antigen changes.
