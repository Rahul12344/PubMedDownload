N-3-Benzyloxycarbonylmethyl- and N-3-carboxymethyl-TBDMS-substituted nucleosides 
were synthesized and evaluated for activity against HIV replication. It was found
that the N-3-carboxymethyl-TBDMS-substituted nucleosides were specific inhibitors
of HIV-1 replication. They should be considered as members of a novel and
original class of NNRTIs.
