A set of sense and anti-sense oligomeric DNA primers, degenerate in the third
"wobble" base position of codons so as to match all known dengue virus sequences,
was evaluated as universal primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for
the rapid diagnosis of dengue virus infections. Virus-specific complementary DNA 
(cDNA) was prepared by reverse transcription (RT) of total RNA extracted from
serum. Amplified cDNA was identified by nucleic acid hybridization with four
serotype-specific, oligomeric DNA probes. Using sera from patients admitted with 
dengue fever, RT/PCR followed by nucleic acid hybridization using radiolabeled
probes was 68% sensitive (50/74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 57-78%) and 100% 
specific. Chemiluminescent detection of hybridized products was 62% sensitive
(26/42; 95% CI = 46-75%). Using specimens from which a virus isolate had been
obtained, RT/PCR followed by nucleic acid hybridization with radiolabeled probes 
was 80% sensitive (40/50; 95% CI = 69-91%) and 100% specific. The results suggest
that RT/PCR using degenerate primers is a sensitive and specific method for the
detection of dengue viruses in clinical specimens.
