BACKGROUND: Increased travelling to countries endemic for dengue fever (DF)
demands efficient laboratory diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification techniques
(NAT) are now frequently used for rapid diagnosis of imported viral diseases.
Different PCR systems are available.
OBJECTIVES: In order to assess the quality of molecular diagnostics of dengue
virus infections, an external quality assurance (EQA) in PCR diagnostics was
conducted.
STUDY DESIGN: A panel of 10 human plasma samples was prepared and spiked with
dengue virus types DEN-1 to DEN-4. In addition, a 10-fold dilution series
(1:10-1:10(4) ) of DEN-3 virus was included. The panel was pre-tested by nested
RT-PCR, in-house real-time PCR, and a commercial real-time PCR kit. The samples
were inactivated by gamma irradiation and shipped in freeze dried state. Thirteen
laboratories, within the European network for the diagnostics of imported viral
diseases (ENIVD) took part using either single-round, nested, or real-time RT-PCR
methods. Two laboratories used two methods in parallel, summarising up to 15
comparable results.
RESULTS: 33-100% correct results were achieved. All laboratories detected DEN-2
correctly, followed by DEN-1 (14 positive results of 15), DEN-3 (12/15) and DEN-4
(11/15). Testing of the serial dilution revealed low sensitivity in many labs,
with results ranging from 33 to 80% of correctly tested samples.
CONCLUSION: The EQA gives a feedback of the quality of the RT-PCR system used by 
each respective laboratory. The different test systems and amplification
conditions demonstrate the importance of external quality control measures.
