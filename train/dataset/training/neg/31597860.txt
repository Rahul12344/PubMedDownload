Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) is one of the EBV-associated T/NK
lymphoproliferative diseases. The prognosis of CAEBV is very poor, and without
curative therapy, almost half of patients will die within five years of onset.
The results of a 3-step treatment regimen consisting of step 1
(immunochemotherapy), step 2 (multi-drug chemotherapy), and step 3 (hematopoietic
cell transplantation, HCT) are excellent. HCT is the only cure for CAEBV, and
reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is superior to myeloablative conditioning
(MAC). The overall survival rate is typically more than 90% following bone marrow
transplantation and cord blood transplantation.
