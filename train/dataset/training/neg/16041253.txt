OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide information on the
prevalence of herpes simplex infections in the general population in Europe.
GOALS: The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of clinically
probable genital herpes and the relationship between serotype and clinical
expression in a French community-based sample.
STUDY: A total of 4410 subjects chosen at random were serotyped for herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Data on
symptoms were obtained by questionnaire allowing retrospective diagnosis of
clinically probable genital herpes.
RESULTS: Questionnaire data and serotype were available for 3192 subjects.
Seroprevalences of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 65.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Prevalence
of clinically probable genital herpes was 11.8%, identified in 11.1% of
HSV-1-positive subjects and 26.8% of HSV-2-positive subjects, with a lower
prevalence in those coinfected with both virus types.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically probable genital herpes was observed in one fourth of
subjects with HSV-2 infections and in some subjects with HSV-1 infection.
Coinfection with HSV-1 appeared to protect against symptom expression in subjects
infected with HSV-2.
