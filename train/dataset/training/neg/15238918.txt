We prospectively studied the levels of eicosanoids in intubated patients with
severe bronchiolitis and compared them to electively intubated non-infected
infants. LeukotrieneE(4) (LTE(4)), leukotrieneB(4) (LTB(4)), and
prostaglandinE(2) (PGE(2)) levels were significantly increased (P <.01) from
endotracheal (ET) aspirates of infants with bronchiolitis compared with controls,
as were urinary LTE(4) levels (P <.001). We conclude that eicosanoids are
increased in the tracheal aspirates and urine of children with bronchiolitis.
