Stimulation of simian virus 40 late gene expression by simian virus 40 tumor
antigen.

The early simian virus 40 (SV40) gene product, large tumor (T) antigen, is
responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication and the autoregulation of
early gene expression through direct protein-DNA interactions. We investigated
the role of T antigen in late viral gene expression, independent of its function 
in amplifying templates through DNA replication. SV40 DNA was transfected into
BSC-1 and COS-1 cells and cultured in the presence of inhibitors of DNA
replication. Electrophoretic immunoblot analysis indicated that both the onset
and the extent of SV40 late gene expression is increased in COS-1 cells, which
constitutively express SV40 T antigen. Blot hybridization analysis of
poly(A)-selected RNA demonstrated that the level of synthesis of the major late
structural protein VP-1 in COS-1 cells was due to increased transcription.
Similar results were obtained when plasmids that contain the SV40 late gene but
lack both the origin for viral DNA replication and the early gene coding region
were transfected onto COS-1 cells. Using lines of SV40-transformed monkey kidney 
cells that express altered T antigens, we found that enhanced expression of the
late gene product is correlated with the ability of T antigen to bind SV40 DNA.
These results indicate that large T antigen plays a role in the stimulation of
late viral gene expression.
