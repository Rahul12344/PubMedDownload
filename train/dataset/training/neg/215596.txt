Transport and phosphorylation of hexoses in normal and Rous sarcoma
virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts.

Singh M, Singh VN, August JT, Horecker BL.

Effects of transformation by Rous sarcoma virus on sugar uptake and activity and 
the subcellular distribution of hexokinase isozymes in chick embryo fibroblasts
were examined. Transformation caused a several-fold increase in the maximum
velocity for uptake of 2-deoxyglucose without a significant change in Km.
Cytochalasin B (CB), was used to differentiate between the effects of
transformation on facilitated diffusion and the nonsaturable (CB-insensitive)
mode. Transformation was found to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose transport by both
mechanisms, but the increase in transport by the CB-insensitive mode was greater.
Transformation enhances the activity of hexokinase, the enhancement being
confined to the particulate fraction of the enzyme. Heat-inactivation and
electrophoretic mobility studies showed that although hexokinase Type I is the
major form in both normal and transformed fibroblasts, there is a significant
increase in the proportion of the Type II isozyme in the transformed cells.
