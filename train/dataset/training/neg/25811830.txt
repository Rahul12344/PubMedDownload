Phylogenetic analysis of influenza viruses collected during December
2009-February 2010 from chickens in live poultry retail shops in Lahore,
Pakistan, showed influenza A(H9N2) lineage polymerase and nonstructural genes
generate through inter- and intrasubtypic reassortments. Many amino acid
signatures observed were characteristic of human isolates; hence, their
circulation could enhance inter- or intrasubtypic reassortment.
