Human papillomaviruses are causative agents in several human diseases ranging
from genital warts to ano-genital and oropharyngeal cancers. Currently only
symptoms of HPV induced disease are treated; there are no antivirals available
that directly target the viral life cycle. Previously, we determined that the
cellular protein TopBP1 interacts with the HPV16 replication/transcription factor
E2. This E2-TopBP1 interaction is essential for optimal E1-E2 DNA replication and
for the viral life cycle. The drug calcein disrupts the interaction of TopBP1
with itself and other host proteins to promote cell death. Here we demonstrate
that calcein blocks HPV16 E1-E2 DNA replication via blocking the viral
replication complex forming at the origin of replication. This occurs at
non-toxic levels of calcein and demonstrates specificity as it does not block the
ability of E2 to regulate transcription. We propose that calcein or derivatives
could be developed as an anti-HPV therapeutic.
