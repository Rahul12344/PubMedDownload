The ability to deplete specific proteins from cells has transformed cell biology.
Targeting of gene transcripts using RNA interference has allowed for a highly
refined approach to the analysis of gene function that has been applied to all
aspects of cell biology. Developments of the technology have reached a point
where it is now a relatively trivial task to assess the role of an individual
protein in a particular cell function. RNAi also allows for genome-wide screening
as a discovery step toward the identification of new components of cellular
pathways and machines. The technique has been applied extensively to the analysis
of Golgi complex function, leading to significant insight into the biology of
this complex organelle. Here, we describe the commonly used options for targeting
individual genes for both transient and stable knockdown. We consider the
alternative methods for introducing these reagents into cells and outline methods
that we and others have used widely for validation of specificity and efficacy of
gene targeting.
