The human genome contains approximately 50 copies of the replication-defective
human endogenous retrovirus 9 (ERV-9) and thousands of copies of its solitary
long term repeat (sLTR) element. While some sLTRs are located upstream of
critical genes and have enhancer activity, other sLTRs are located within introns
and may be transcribed as RNAs. We found that intronic RNAs arising from U3 sLTRs
of ERV-9 were expressed as both sense (S) and antisense (AS) transcripts in all
human cells tested but that expression levels differed in malignant versus
nonmalignant cells. In nonmalignant cells, AS was expressed at higher levels than
S and at higher levels than in malignant cells; in malignant cells, AS was
expressed at amounts equivalent to those of S RNA. Critically, U3 AS RNA was
found to physically bind to key transcription factors for cellular proliferation,
including NF-Y, p53, and sp1, indicating that such RNA transcripts may function
as decoy targets or traps for NF-Y and thus inhibit the growth of human cancer
cells. Indeed, short U3 oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) based on these RNA sequences
ably inhibited proliferation of cancer cell lines driven by cyclins B1/B2, the
gene targets of NF-Y.
