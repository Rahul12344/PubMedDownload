West Nile Virus (WNV), an RNA arbovirus and member of the Japanese encephalitis
virus antigenic complex, causes a wide range of clinical symptoms, from
asymptomatic to encephalitis and meningitis. Nearly all human infections of WNV
are due to mosquito bites with birds being the primary amplifying hosts. Advanced
age is the most important risk factor for neurological disease leading most often
to poor prognosis in those afflicted. We report a case of WNV meningoencephalitis
in a 93-year-old Caucasian male who presented with fever of unknown origin (FUO) 
and nuchal rigidity that rapidly decompensated within 24 h to a persistent
altered mental state during inpatient stay. The patient's ELISA antibody titers
confirmed pathogenesis of disease by WNV; he given supportive measures and
advanced to an excellent recovery. In regard to the approach of FUO, it is
important to remain impartial yet insightful to all elements when determining
pathogenesis in atypical presentation.
