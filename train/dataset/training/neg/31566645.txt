The early detection of low abundance anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV
Ab) is critical for efficient diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection. In this
work, a new colorimetric assay method has been proposed for the sensitive
detection of anti-HCV Ab. In this method, the antibody-induced DNA strand
displacement and the resulting rolling circle amplification (RCA) are integrated 
to generate a large amount of tandemly repeated G-quadruplex DNAzymes on the arm 
of the "Y"-shaped antibody. Consequently, oxidation of
3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine can be extensively catalyzed by the
peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes. Therefore, the readout signal can be greatly
amplified. Further studies reveal that 0.998 pM anti-HCV Ab can be detected by
this newly developed assay method. Moreover, the strategy proposed in this method
can be adapted for the detection of other antibodies or bivalent targets.
