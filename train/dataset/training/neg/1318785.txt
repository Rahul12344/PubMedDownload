The generation of infectious defective interfering (DI) particles of vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) entirely from cDNA clones is reported. Bacteriophage T7
RNA polymerase was used to direct the transcription of a complete
negative-stranded genomic RNA from a cDNA clone of a VSV DI RNA in cells
simultaneously expressing the five VSV proteins from separately transfected cDNA 
clones. The negative-stranded transcript was encapsidated with N protein,
replicated by the VSV polymerase, and the replicated RNAs were assembled and
budded to yield infectious DI virions. No helper VSV was required. Replication
occurred at high levels and was assayed by direct biochemical means. An exact 3' 
terminus of the initial transcript, which was generated by autolytic cleavage
using a ribozyme from hepatitis delta virus, was critical for replication.
