In a previous work we selected montanide ISA720 (M-ISA720) among different
adjuvants for the vaccination with a V3 loop based multi-epitope polypeptide
TAB9. In this paper we present the evaluation of the toxicity and immunogenicity 
of this formulation in non-human primates. TAB9 in M-ISA720 was highly
immunogenic in macaques (Macaca fascicularis) inducing antibodies against TAB9 in
all animals after one inoculation and a strong anamnestic response after booster 
injections. Furthermore 97% of the V3 peptides included were recognized by TAB9
sera. No differences between doses of 200 microg and 1 mg of TAB9 in M-ISA720
were observed after four immunizations. Neutralizing antibodies against five
HIV-1 isolates were detected in most animals. Animals remain healthy throughout
the study and did not show lesions at the inoculation site.
