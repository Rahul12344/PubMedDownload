In chlorovirus infection, immediate-early gene expression occurs within 5-20 min 
post infection (p.i.). We identified 16 major immediate-early transcripts. On
Northern blot analysis, these transcripts showed unusual behaviors: (I) after 40 
min p.i., their sizes reduced by approximately 100 nt, most likely caused by loss
of a poly(A) tail and (II) after 40 min p.i., often appeared a few larger
additional transcripts that may be formed by read-through from an upstream gene
or into a downstream gene. These results indicate that the transcription of the
viral genes changes drastically between before and after 40 min p.i.
