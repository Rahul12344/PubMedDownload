INTRODUCTION: The Ebola 2014/2015 outbreak has had devastating effects on the
people living in West Africa. The spread of the disease in endemic countries and 
the potential introduction of sporadic cases in other continents points out the
global health threat of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Despite the urgent need for
treating EVD, there are no approved treatments. Given the lack of treatments
available, alternative therapeutic strategies have had to be used.
AREAS COVERED: This article summarizes the unregistered therapeutics that were
used to treat patients during the Ebola 2014/2015 outbreak, in addition to
approaches used for the selection of candidate drugs. The article also proposes
potential theoretical criterion for use in virtual screening of molecular
libraries for candidate Ebola drugs.
EXPERT OPINION: In the absence of approved therapeutics for EVD, experimental
drugs have had to be used. The repurposing of approved drugs for the treatment of
EVD, as an alternative therapeutic strategy, has also been suggested. Screening
in vitro- and in silico-approved drugs revealed several promising candidates but 
further testing is required to test their efficacy. All these therapeutic
approaches are, however, only short-term solutions and there is still an urgent
need for the development of specific drugs for the current and future outbreaks.
