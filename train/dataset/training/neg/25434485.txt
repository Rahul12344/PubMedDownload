BACKGROUND: Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG antibodies) was
found in various demyelinated diseases. This is the first report of a patient
with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis with an extremely high titer of
MOG antibodies after an influenza infection. This case supports the view that MOG
antibodies are linked to longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and that
influenza infection might trigger the MOG antibodies.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old healthy male developed high fever, dysesthesia
and paraesthesia below the C2 area, muscle weakness of the bilateral lower
extremities, and urinary retention ten days after an influenza type A infection. 
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a longitudinal lesion in the spinal cord
extending from C2 to the spinal conus. There were no lesions in the brain or
optic nerves. Established cell-based immunoassays revealed that he was positive
for MOG antibodies (titer = 65,536) and negative for anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies 
(AQP4 antibodies). He fully recovered after steroid pulse therapy followed by
60Â mg prednisolone.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of influenza A-associated longitudinally
extensive transverse myelitis with a high titer anti-MOG antibodies. Our case
report supports a relationship between anti-MOG antibodies and longitudinally
extensive transverse myelitis, which was triggered by influenza infection.
Further studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of anti-MOG
antibodies for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.
