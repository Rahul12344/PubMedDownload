Enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41 (Ad40 and Ad41) are a prominent cause of
gastroenteritis in young children. Diagnosis of these enteric types by
conventional means is complicated by their fastidious growth characteristics.
Enteric adenovirus growth was enhanced by cocultivation. Typing of enteric
isolates currently entails analysis of the extracted viral DNA with restriction
enzymes. Restriction endonuclease fragments of the Ad41 strain Tak genome were
ordered by (i) double digestion, (ii) release of restriction fragments from
plasmids containing 84% of the Ad41 genome in EcoRI fragments A, B and C, (iii)
hybridization of Southern blotted Ad41 fragments with EcoRI fragment containing
plasmids and various segments of the Ad2 genome, (iv) sequential reduction of the
genome beginning with terminal restriction fragments with exonuclease III and S1 
nuclease. The termini of adenovirus genomes are difficult to clone and the use of
exonuclease III is a useful alternative to conventional restriction mapping. DNA 
restriction patterns, fragment sizes and restriction maps of the Ad4 1 strain Tak
with enzymes BamHI, BglII, ClaI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, SalI, SmaI and XhoI are
presented. Prototype strain restriction maps should enable better understanding
of adenovirus type 41 and its epidemiology.
