The parvoviruses are a family of single-stranded DNA-containing viruses which are
known to establish inapparent infections of continuous, and in some cases,
primary cell cultures. Their small size and great stability suggest that they
would be difficult to eliminate from a biological component purified from a
contaminated cell line. Thus, precautions should be taken to exclude such agents 
from initial cell cultures, and from the reagents used to maintain them.
