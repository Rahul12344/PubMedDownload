In May 2009, one of the earliest outbreaks of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus
(pH1N1) infection resulted in the closure of a semi-rural Pennsylvania elementary
school. Two sequential telephone surveys were administered to 1345 students (85% 
of the students enrolled in the school) and household members in 313 households
to collect data on influenza-like illness (ILI). A total of 167 persons (12.4%)
among those in the surveyed households, including 93 (24.0%) of the School A
students, reported ILI. Students were 3.1 times more likely than were other
household members to develop ILI (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-4.1).
Fourth-grade students were more likely to be affected than were students in other
grades (relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). pH1N1 was confirmed in 26 (72.2%)
of the individuals tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction. The outbreak did not resume upon the reopening of the school after the 
7-day closure. This investigation found that pH1N1 outbreaks at schools can have 
substantial attack rates; however, grades and classrooms are affected variably.
Additional study is warranted to determine the effectiveness of school closure
during outbreaks.
