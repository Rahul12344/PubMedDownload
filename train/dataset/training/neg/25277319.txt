Over the past decades, many new therapeutic approaches have been developed for
several conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, efficient
biodistribution and delivery at biological target sites are hampered by the
presence of cell and tissue barriers, and a clinical therapy is prevented by the 
requirement of invasive administration routes. Candidate drug conjugation to
cell-penetrating peptides, which are able to cross cellular membranes and reach
biological targets even when administered systemically, represents a promising
tool to overcome this issue. Here, we review the biology, classification and
mechanisms of internalization of cell-penetrating peptides. We focus our
attention on the cell-penetrating peptide: HIV-derived Tat peptide, and discuss
its efficient but controversial use in basic, preclinical and clinical research
from its discovery to the present day.
