Expression of the hepatitis B virus X gene in mammalian cells.

Siddiqui A, Jameel S, Mapoles J.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) designated
X, which has the capacity to encode a protein of 16,560 Da (subtype adw). Such a 
protein has not been identified in either HBV particles or infected human livers,
and therefore its role in the viral life cycle remains unknown. We report here
the expression of the HBV X ORF in cultured cells using recombinant vectors. A
protein of 16 kDa was identified by means of an antiserum prepared against a
synthetic peptide and with human antisera from hepatitis B patients as well as
those with hepatocellular carcinoma. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence
studies suggest a probable association with cytoskeletal components. Our studies 
further located a promoter sequence upstream of the X ORF, which directs the
transcription of a 0.7- to 0.8-kilobase X-specific RNA in transfected human
hepatoma cells.
