The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Piper yellow mottle
virus and the reverse transcription (RT) LAMP assay for Cucumber mosaic virus
each consisted of a set of five primers designed against the conserved sequences 
in the viral genome. Both RNA and DNA isolated from black pepper were used as a
template for the assay. The results were assessed visually by checking turbidity,
green fluorescence and pellet formation in the reaction tube and also by gel
electrophoresis. The assay successfully detected both viruses in infected plants 
whereas no cross-reactions were recorded with healthy plants. Optimum conditions 
for successful amplification were determined in terms of the concentrations of
magnesium sulphate and betaine, temperature, and duration. The detection limit
for both LAMP and RT-LAMP was up to 100 times that for conventional PCR and up to
one-hundredth of that for real-time PCR. The optimal conditions arrived at were
validated by testing field samples of infected vines of three species from
different regions.
