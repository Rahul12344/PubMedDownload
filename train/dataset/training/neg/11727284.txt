Patients with hematological malignancies and infants with congenital
immunodeficiencies who received blood are two of many populations at risk for
transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Of the methodologies 
(eg, photoinactivation, peglyation, ultraviolet light, and irradiation) that can 
be used to prevent TA-GVHD, only irradiation of whole blood and cellular
components is currently accepted practice of the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Among the newer methods that have been developed to reduce the risks of
bacterial and viral contaminants of platelet transfusions, photochemical
treatment (PCT) using psoralens and long-wavelength ultraviolet (UVA) irradiation
modifies bacterial and viral genomes sufficiently to inhibit replication. Among a
broad group of compounds, the synthetic psoralen compound amotosalen
hydrochloride (HCl) (S-59) has been shown to be particularly effective in
inactivating bacteria and viruses, without adversely affecting in vitro and in
vivo platelet function.
