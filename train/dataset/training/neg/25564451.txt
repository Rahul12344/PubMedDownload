PURPOSE: We determined the ultrastructure of mouse adenovirus keratitis, a model 
for human adenovirus keratitis.
METHODS: Adenovirus keratitis was induced in C57Bl/6j mice by intrastromal
injection of human adenovirus species D type 37 (HAdV-D37) with a heat-pulled,
glass, micropipette needle under compressed air. At select time points after
infection, mice were euthanized and their corneas removed, fixed, and sectioned
at 70-nm thickness for electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Injection of HAdV-D37 into the mouse corneal stroma placed virus
predominantly in the pericellular corneal stromal matrix. Virus was seen bound to
and entering stromal cells at 1 and 2 hours after infection, respectively. Cell
membrane transit by virus was seen to involve two distinct structures resembling 
caveolae and macropinosomes. However, later during infection intracellular virus 
was not seen within membrane-bound organelles. By 8 hours after infection,
intracellular virus had accumulated into densely packed, perinuclear arrays.
Virus disassembly was not obvious at any time point after infection. Infiltrating
neutrophils seen by one day after infection had engulfed degraded stromal cells
by 4 days after infection.
CONCLUSIONS: By transmission electron microscopy, injected HAdV-D37 readily
enters stromal cells in the C57Bl/6j mouse cornea and induces stromal
inflammation, as was shown previously by light microscopy. However, electron
microscopy also revealed dense, static arrays of intracytoplasmic virus,
suggesting a block in viral capsid disassembly and viral DNA nuclear entry. These
findings may explain why human adenoviruses do not replicate in the mouse corneal
stroma.
