Cowpea mosaic virus RNAs have neither m7GpppN ... nor mono-, di- or triphosphates
at their 5' ends.

Klootwijk J, Klein I, Zabel P, van Kammen A.

32P-labeled cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) RNAs were analyzed for their 5' termini by
three different fingerprinting standard procedures. These analyses showed
unequivocally that CPMV RNAs lack a structure like m7GpppN ... at their 5'
termini. In addition, neither mono-, di- or triphosphorylated [(p)(p)pN ....]
termini were found in the respective fingerprints. The inability to label the 5' 
termini treatment with gamma-32P-ATP and polynucleotide kinase, either per se or 
after pretreatment with alkaline phosphatase, strongly suggests the absence of a 
free 5'-OH and a free 5'-phosphate at the 5' terminal nucleotide in CPMV RNAs.
The various analyses also showed that no 2' -O-methylated nucleotides,
N6-methyladenosines or pseudo-uridines are present in CPMV RNAs.
