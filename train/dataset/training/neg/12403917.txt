Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the major cause of respiratory infections. We
developed a diagnostic method for HRVs based on the reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and VP4-based phylogenetic analysis. A set of 
primers used in the RT-PCR of human enteroviruses (EVs) appeared to be capable of
amplifying all prototype strains of HRVs, each of which generated a 530-bp
fragment. The single exception was HRV-87, which generated a 650-bp fragment, as 
observed in human EVs. The VP4 nucleotide sequence of HRV-87 showed more than 97%
nucleotide identity with human EV-68, and formed a monophyletic cluster along
with the prototype strain of EV-68 in the human EV-D cluster. HRV-87 showed the
second highest homology (76.8%) with EV-70, another member of the human EV-D, in 
a sample of 66 human EVs and 12 HRVs. Therefore, HRV-87 should be reclassified
into the cluster containing human EV-68.
