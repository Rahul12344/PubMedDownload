Background & objectives: Influenza virological surveillance is an essential tool 
for the early detection of novel genetic variants of epidemiologic and clinical
significance. This study was aimed to genetically characterize A(H1N1)pdm09 virus
circulating in 2017 and to compare it with the global data.
Methods: The regional/State Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs)
provided influenza diagnosis for referred clinical samples and shared influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 positives with the Indian Council of Medical Research-National
Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, India, for hemagglutinin (HA) gene
phylogenetic analysis. Sites at Manipal, Jaipur and Dibrugarh performed the
sequencing and shared the sequence data for analysis. The antiviral
susceptibility of influenza viruses was assessed for known molecular marker H275Y
at the ICMR-NIV, Pune.
Results: All the eight VRDLs had well-established influenza diagnostic facilities
and showed increased activity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during 2017. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that the viruses from the different regions of the country were
similar to A/Michigan/45/2015 strain which was the 2017-2018 recommended vaccine 
strain and were clustered with the globally circulating clade 6B.1 with signature
mutations S84N, S162N and I216T. The clade 6B.1 showed further subgrouping with
additional mutations S74R, S164T and I295V; however, there was no significant
association between the presence of these mutations and severity of disease due
to influenza. All the study viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir.
Interpretation & conclusions: During the study period, all the study sites
reported globally circulating A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain of influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and remained sensitive to oseltamivir. Further genetic and
antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is recommended to address public 
health concerns.
