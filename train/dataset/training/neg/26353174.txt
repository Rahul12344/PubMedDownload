CXCL12/CXCR4 axis: an emerging neuromodulator in pathological pain.

Luo X, Wang X, Xia Z, Chung SK, Cheung CW.

The roles of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) and its receptor chemokine 
C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) reveal this chemokine axis as an emerging
neuromodulator in the nervous system. In the peripheral and central nervous
systems, both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are expressed in various kinds of nociceptive
structures, and CXCL12/CXCR4 axis possesses pronociceptive property. Recent
studies have demonstrated its critical roles in the development and maintenance
of pathological pain, and both neuronal and glial mechanisms are involved in this
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis-mediated pain processing. In this review, we summarize the
recent development of the roles and mechanisms of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the
pathogenesis of chronic pain by sciatic nerve injury, human immunodeficiency
virus-associated sensory neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury,
bone cancer, opioid tolerance, or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. The potential
targeting of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as an effective and broad-spectrum pharmacological
approach for chronic pain therapy was also discussed.
