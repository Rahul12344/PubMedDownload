Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is closely associated with tumorigenesis and
development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the underlying molecular
mechanisms remain poorly understood. It has been recently reported that EBV
encodes 44 mature miRNAs, some of which were found to promote tumor development
by targeting virus-infected host genes or self-viral genes. However, few targets 
of EBV encoded-miRNAs that are related to NPC development have been identified to
date. In this study, we revealed that in NPC cells, EBV-miR-BART10-3p directly
targets BTRC gene that encodes βTrCP (beta-transducin repeat containing E3
ubiquitin protein ligase). We found that EBV-miR-BART10-3p expression in clinical
samples from a cohort of 106 NPC patients negatively correlated with BTRC
expression levels. Over-expression of EBV-miR-BART10-3p and down-regulation of
BTRC were associated with poor prognosis in NPC patients. EBV-miR-BART10-3p
promoted the invasion and migration cabilities of NPC cells through the targeting
of BTRC and regulation of the expression of the downstream substrates β-catenin
and Snail. As a result, EBV-miR-BART10-3p facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of NPC. Our study presents an unreported mechanism underlying EBV
infection in NPC carcinogenesis, and provides a potential novel biomarker for NPC
diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
