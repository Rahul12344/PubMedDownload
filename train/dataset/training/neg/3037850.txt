Vaccination-induced activation of human blood T cells suppressing pneumococcal
polysaccharide-specific B cells.

Heilmann C.

In order to study the regulation of the human B cell response to pneumococcal
polysaccharides (PPS), anti-PPS-secreting cells (SC) and Ig-SC were quantitated
in unstimulated and EBV-stimulated cultures of blood mononuclear cells (MNC)
established before and one and two weeks after vaccination. In unstimulated
cultures established one week after vaccination, significant numbers of
anti-PPS-SC were detected; however, they were observed only in cultures depleted 
of T cells (mean: 62/10(6)), suggesting the presence of T cells suppressing in
vivo-activated PPS-specific B cells. In EBV-stimulated cultures depleted of T
cells, low numbers of anti-PPS-SC were observed before the vaccination, and the
numbers of these cells increased significantly two weeks after the immunization
(from 28 to 48/10(6)). In contrast, the numbers of anti-PPS-SC and total Ig-SC
decreased in EBV-stimulated cultures of unseparated MNC established after the
vaccination, suggesting T cell-mediated suppression. The findings were not
explained by changes in the numbers of blood T helper (Leu 3+) or T suppressor
(Leu 2+) cells following the vaccination. Possibly the vaccination induces the
appearance in the blood of activated suppressor cells responsible for the
suppression of B cells in unstimulated and EBV-stimulated cultures.
