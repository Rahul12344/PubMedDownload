The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has stimulated
development of alternative therapeutics. Bacteriophage peptidoglycan hydrolases, 
termed lysins, represent an emerging antimicrobial option for targeting
Gram-positive bacteria. However, lysins against Gram-negatives are generally
deterred by the outer membrane and their inability to work in serum. One solution
involves exploiting evolved delivery systems used by colicin-like bacteriocins
(e.g., S-type pyocins of P. aeruginosa) to translocate through the outer
membrane. Following surface receptor binding, colicin-like bacteriocins form Tol-
or TonB-dependent translocons to actively import bactericidal domains through
outer membrane protein channels. With this understanding, we developed lysocins, 
which are bioengineered lysin-bacteriocin fusion molecules capable of periplasmic
import. In our proof-of-concept studies, components from the P. aeruginosa
bacteriocin pyocin S2 (PyS2) responsible for surface receptor binding and outer
membrane translocation were fused to the GN4 lysin to generate the PyS2-GN4
lysocin. PyS2-GN4 delivered the GN4 lysin to the periplasm to induce
peptidoglycan cleavage and log-fold killing of P. aeruginosa with minimal
endotoxin release. While displaying narrow-spectrum antipseudomonal activity in
human serum, PyS2-GN4 also efficiently disrupted biofilms, outperformed
standard-of-care antibiotics, exhibited no cytotoxicity toward eukaryotic cells, 
and protected mice from P. aeruginosa challenge in a bacteremia model. In
addition to targeting P. aeruginosa, lysocins can be constructed to target other 
prominent Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
