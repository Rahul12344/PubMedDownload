OBJECTIVE: This paper was to study the influence of hot spot mutation in
hepatitis B virus (HBV) basic core promotor (BCP) (nt1762 and nt1764) on HBeAg
status of asymptomatic HBV carriers.
METHODS: Mismatched PCR was used to amplify the fragment of HBVBCP and the
fragments were analysed by restrict enzyme assay. Ninety cases of HBV infection
were tested for hot spot mutations in HBVBCP.
RESULTS: Twenty-six (43.3%) of 60 asymptomatic HBV carriers with HBeAg negative
were found to have hot spot mutations in HBVBCP, among which 20 cases were
accompanied by the mutation of nt 1896 in HBV Pre-C region. Hot-spot mutation in 
HBVBCP, however, occurred only in 3(10%) of 30 asymptomatic HBV carriers with
HBeAg positive. For further investigation the HBVBCP hot spot mutations in
asymptomatic HBV carriers without mutation of HBV Pre-C region were studied.
Six(31.6%) of 19 asymptomatic HBV carriers with HBeAg negative were found to have
hot spot mutation in HBVBCP. Two(7.1%) of 28 asymptomatic HBV carriers with HBeAg
positive had hot spot mutations in HBVBCP, and there was a statistically
significant difference between two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Hot spot mutations in HBVBCP is common in the HBV carriers with
HBeAg negative and usually accompanies with nt1896 mutation of HBV Pre-C region. 
It is possible that Hot spot mutation in HBVBCP is a new reason of HBeAg negative
HBV infection.
