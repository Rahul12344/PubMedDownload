The virulent satellite [satellite C (sat C)] of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is a
small pathogenic RNA that intensifies symptoms in TCV-infected turnip plants
(Brassica campestris). The virulence of sat C is determined by properties of the 
satellite itself and is influenced by the helper virus. Symptoms produced in
infections with sat C differ in severity depending on the helper virus. The
TCV-JI helper virus produces more severe symptoms than the TCV-B helper virus
when inoculated with sat C. To find determinants in the TCV helper virus genome
that affect satellite virulence, the TCV-JI genome was cloned and the sequence
compared to the TCV-B genome. The genomes were found to differ by only five base 
changes, and only one of the base changes, at nucleotide position 1025, produced 
an amino acid change, an aspartic acid----glycine in the putative viral
replicase. A chimeric TCV genome (TCV-B/JI) containing four of the five base
changes (including the base change at position 1025) and a mutant TCV-B genome
(TCV-B1025G) containing a single base substitution at position 1025 converted the
TCV-B genome into a form that produces severe symptoms with sat C. The base
change a position 1025 is located in the helicase of the putative viral
replicase, and symptom intensification appears to result from differences in the 
rate of replication of the satellite supported by the two helper viruses.
