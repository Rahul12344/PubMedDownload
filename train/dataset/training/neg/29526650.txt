miRNAs are potent tools that in principle can be used to control the replication 
of infectious agents. The objectives of the studies reported here were to design 
miRNAs that can block the replication of herpes simplex virus 1 and which could
be delivered to infected cells via exosomes. We report the following: (1) We
designed three miRNAs targeting the mRNA encoding ICP4, an essential viral
regulatory protein. Of the three miRNAs, one miRNA401 effectively blocked ICP4
accumulation and viral replication on transfection into susceptible cells. (2) To
facilitate packaging of the miRNA into exosomes, we incorporated into the
sequence of miRNA401 an exosome-packaging motif. miRNA401 was shown to be
packaged into exosomes and successfully delivered by exosomes to susceptible
cells, where it remained stable for at least 72 hr. Finally, the results show
that miRNA401 delivered to cells via exosomes effectively reduced virus yields in
a miRNA401 dose-dependent fashion. The protocol described in this report can be
applied to study viral gene functions without actually deleting or mutagenizing
the gene.
