We report 16 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis with normal chest x-ray film
associated with infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These
patients belong to a sample of 125 cases of tuberculosis and HIV infection
observed during the same study period. The clinical features and the diagnostic
methods are described. The unusual character of the finding and its relevance are
discussed, as the presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis with normal chest x-ray 
film was relatively common in patients with HIV infection (12.8%) in our series. 
This possibility should be considered in the whole population of patients with
HIV infection.
