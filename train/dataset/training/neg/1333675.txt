Adult ponies which were fed ovalbumin (OVA) daily for 2 weeks had significantly
greater serum anti-OVA IgG (P = 0.001) and antigen specific lymphocyte responses 
(P = 0.031) after intramuscular injection with OVA given with saponin than
control ponies which had not been fed the antigen. This suggests that, despite
the lack of evidence of B- or T-cell activation in peripheral blood during the
period of OVA feeding, the animals were primed for an active secondary immune
response. Adult ponies were challenged with equine rotavirus, strain H-2, but no 
statistically significant differences were found in serum IgG-associated antibody
responses or antigen-specific lymphocyte responses between the
rotavirus-challenged group and the control group, either following rotavirus
challenge or intramuscular injection of rotavirus antigen given with saponin. Our
findings, that feeding the non-replicating protein antigen OVA appeared to prime 
for an increased immune response rather than inducing oral tolerance, may be of
relevance to future studies on the way the equine gastrointestinal tract handles 
usually harmless antigens.
