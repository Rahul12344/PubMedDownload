Influenza attaches to host cells via hemagglutinin binding of cell-surface
glycans. These relatively low-affinity interactions involving flexible ligands
are critical in determining tissue and host specificity, but their dynamic nature
complicates structural characterization of hemagglutinin-receptor complexes.
Molecular simulation can assist in analyzing glycan and protein flexibility in
crystallized complexes, assessing how binding might change under mutation or
altered glycosylation patterns, and evaluating how soluble ligands may relate to 
physiological presentation on the plasma membrane. Molecular dynamics simulation 
also has the potential to help integrate structural and dynamic data sources.
Here we review recent progress from analysis of molecular dynamics simulation and
outline challenges for the future.
