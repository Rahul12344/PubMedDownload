Escherichia coli is a common cause of meningitis and sepsis in the newborn
infant, and the large majority of isolates from these infections produce a
polysialic acid (PSA) capsular polysaccharide, the K1 antigen, that protects the 
bacterial cell from immune attack. We determined whether a capsule-depolymerizing
enzyme, by removing this protective barrier, could alter the outcome of systemic 
infection in an animal model. Bacteriophage-derived endosialidase E (endoE)
selectively degrades the PSA capsule on the surface of E. coli K1 strains.
Intraperitoneal administration of small quantities of recombinant endoE (20 micro
g) to 3-day-old rats, colonized with a virulent strain of K1, prevented
bacteremia and death from systemic infection. The enzyme had no effect on the
viability of E. coli strains but sensitized strains expressing PSA to killing by 
the complement system. This study demonstrates the potential therapeutic efficacy
of agents that cure infections by modification of the bacterial phenotype rather 
than by killing or inhibition of growth of the pathogen.
