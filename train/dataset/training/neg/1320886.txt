Sixteen infants in our intensive care nursery (ICN) were inadvertently exposed to
an adult who presented the next day with chickenpox. Since a majority of the
patients were extremely premature, we were concerned that they might not have
received transplacental varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody, and consequently
would be at risk for contracting chickenpox. Serum samples were obtained from
each infant and examined for the presence or absence of VZV antibody. Fourteen of
the 16 infants had antibody levels equal to or in excess of 1:16 by indirect
fluorescent antibody, including six of eight infants with birthweights equal to
or less than 1000 gm, and eight of ten infants with gestational ages equal to or 
less than 28 weeks. Passive transfer of immunity to VZV appears to be common in
infants as young as 24 to 28 weeks' gestation.
