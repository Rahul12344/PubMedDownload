In cells infected by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), a series of nuclear
changes can be observed in a temporal sequence. Such changes are related to
important modifications in the higher-order structure of host cell chromatin,
such as loss of DNA loop supercoiling and wholesale DNA loop disorganization. It 
is known that the topological relationship between DNA and the nuclear
substructure is a critical factor for proper nuclear physiology. Here we report
that the usual association between newly replicated DNA and the nuclear
substructure, commonly known as nuclear matrix, is abrogated in cells infected by
HSV1, thus establishing a correlation between the virus-induced modifications in 
chromatin higher-order structure and a major biochemical change within the
infected cell nucleus.
