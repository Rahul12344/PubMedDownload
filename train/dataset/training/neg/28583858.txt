Efficient recovery of high quality RNA is very important for successful RT-PCR
detection of plant RNA viruses. High levels of polyphenols and polysaccharides in
plant tissues can irreversibly bind to and/or co-precipitate with RNA, which
influences RNA isolation. In this study, a silica spin column-based RNA isolation
method was developed by using commercially available silica columns combined with
the application of a tissue lysis solution, and binding and washing buffers with 
high concentration guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN, 50% w/v), which helps remove
plant proteins, polysaccharides and polyphenolic compounds. The method was
successfully used to extract high quality RNA from citrus (Citrus aurantifolia), 
grapevine (Vitis vinifera), peach (Prunus persica), pear (Pyrus spp.), taro
(Colocosia esculenta) and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) samples. The method was
comparable to conventional CTAB method in RNA isolation efficiency, but it was
more sample-adaptable and cost-effective than commercial kits. High quality RNA
isolated using silica spin column-based method was successfully used for the
RT-PCR and/or multiplex RT-PCR amplification of woody fruit tree viruses and a
viroid. The study provided a useful tool for the detection and characterization
of plant viruses.
