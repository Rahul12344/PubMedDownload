Herpes zoster occurs very rarely in infancy. We report two infants who developed 
zoster-like lesions at three and seven months of age. They had no history of
chickenpox after birth. Both mothers acquired varicella infection during their
sixth month of pregnancy. The crops of vesicular rashes appeared in right L1-3
dermatomes in one patient and left V3, C2 dermatomes in the other. Laboratory
findings demonstrated a four-fold rise in varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG
antibody in one patient and positive VZV IgM antibody in the other. Both infants 
received acyclovir treatment and the skin lesions healed rapidly without sequela.
In infancy, herpes zoster may be the primary clinical manifestation of
reactivation of latent VZV infection acquired transplacentally during
intrauterine life.
