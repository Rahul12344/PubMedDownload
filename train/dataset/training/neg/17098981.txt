The V protein of the paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV) has been shown to antagonize
the interferon (IFN) response in human cells via sequestration of STAT1 and
STAT2. This study describes a mutant of the NiV V protein, referred to as
V(AAHL), that is unable to antagonize IFN signalling and demonstrates that a
single amino acid substitution is responsible for its inactivity. The molecular
basis for this was identified as a failure to interact with STAT1 and STAT2. It
was also shown that NiV V, but not V(AAHL), was functional as an IFN antagonist
in human, monkey, rabbit, dog, horse, pig and bat cells, which suggests that the 
ability of NiV to block IFN signalling is not a major constraint that prevents
this virus from crossing species barriers.
