Incomplete avian influenza virus contains a defective non-interfering component.

Carter MJ, Mahy BW.

Incomplete avian influenza (fowl plague) virus derived by undiluted egg passage, 
displayed an increased capacity to promote the synthesis of intracellular
virus-specific proteins when compared with standard virus. The in vitro
virion-bound RNA polymerase activity of incomplete virus was also greater than
could be explained by the presence of residual infectious virus. When the titres 
of infectious and interfering virus species were determined directly, they did
not account for all the virus present. The existence of defective non-interfering
(DNI) virus, even in standard virus preparations, was inferred. DNI virus is
capable of initiating infection, synthesis of mRNA and proteins but cannot
complete a productive replication cycle, and does not interfere with
multiplication of standard virus. Such DNI virus could exaggerate the true extent
of DI virus formation by lowering the PFU:HAU ratio and so account for the
failure to correlate infectivity with RNA composition or RNA polymerase activity.
