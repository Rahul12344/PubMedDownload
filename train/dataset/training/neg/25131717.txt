BACKGROUND: Injecting drug use is the primary mode of HIV transmission and
acquisition in Afghanistan. People who inject drugs (PWID) in the country have
been characterized by high risk injecting behavior and a high burden of HCV
infection. We aimed to estimate the burden of HIV, HCV, and other infectious
diseases and to identify the correlates of HIV and HCV infection among PWID
living in three major Afghan cities in 2009.
METHODS: Epidemiologic data was collected among PWID for the integrated
biological and behavioral surveillance (IBBS) survey between May and August, 2009
in three Afghan cities. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and 
biologic specimens to screen for HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, and HSV-2 using rapid
testing kits. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to identify
correlates of infection.
RESULTS: Among 548 participants, pooled HIV prevalence was 7.1% (Mazar-i-Sharif: 
1.0%, Kabul: 3.1%, Herat: 18.4%) and HCV prevalence was 40.3%. Almost all
participants with HIV infection were co-infected with HCV (94.9%). Pooled
prevalence estimates for other diseases included 7.1% for HBV, 5.5% for syphilis;
and 9.3% for HSV-2. Living in Herat, ever in prison and time injecting were
independently associated with HIV infection. Living in Kabul, Herat and time
injecting were independently associated with HCV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high and heterogeneous burden of HIV and HCV among PWID
in Afghan cities. Provision of comprehensive harm reduction services to PWID in
Afghanistan is warranted to reduce exposures associated with HIV and HCV
infection, especially in the city of Herat.
