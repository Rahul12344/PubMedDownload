The Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early protein BZLF1 mediates the switch from
latent to lytic infection. BZLF1 transcription can be derived from either the
BZLF1 promoter or the BRLF1 promoter (Rp). Productive viral infection of
EBV-infected B cells can be induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)
treatment, as well as cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin with
antiimmunoglobulin antibody. Both TPA and antiimmunoglobulin antibody are known
to activate expression of the cellular transcription factor Zif268 in B cells. In
this study, we have examined the regulation of BZLF1 transcription by Zif268. We 
show that Rp (but not the BZLF1 promoter) is activated by Zif268. Bacterially
synthesized Zif268 binds strongly to an upstream sequence in the Rp promoter
(located from -131 to -123 relative to the start site) and more weakly to a
proximal sequence (-49 to -40). Zif268 activation of Rp requires these two Zif268
binding sites. TPA treatment of B cells induces the expression of Zif268 protein,
which binds to Rp. Furthermore, TPA activation of Rp requires the upstream Zif268
site. These findings indicate that Zif268 can activate a critical Epstein-Barr
virus immediate-early promoter and, therefore, may play a key role in the
regulation of viral latency.
