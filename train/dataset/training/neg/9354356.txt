A previously healthy, 37-year-old immunocompetent man presented with disseminated
cutaneous zoster and aseptic meningitis. Varicella zoster virus DNA was recovered
from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the polymerase chain reaction. Cytological 
evaluation of the CSF revealed 'reactive, highly atypical lymphocytosis'. The
patient fully recovered after treatment with aciclovir.
