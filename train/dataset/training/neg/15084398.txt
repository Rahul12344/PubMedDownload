For the past three decades the cold-adapted (ca) and temperature sensitive (ts)
master donor strain, A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) has been successfully used as
the basis for the live attenuated reassortant influenza A vaccine. This donor
strain was developed from A/Leningrad/134/57 (H2N2) wild-type (wt) virus
following 17 passages in eggs at 25 degrees C. Our detailed investigation has
revealed that the A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (Len/17) master donor stock is a mixed
population comprised of numerous variants of the ca/ts Len/17 influenza virus. We
have identified these variants to exhibit a broad range in their temperature
sensitive phenotype when assayed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at 37 
degrees C. A selection of these variant clones has been fully characterized by
sequencing in order to understand the variability in the ts phenotype. This study
has also addressed the feasibility of using cell culture technology for the
propagation and subsequent manufacturing of the cold-adapted influenza vaccine
(CAIV), particularly with respect to retaining the defined mutations that
contribute toward the ca/ts phenotype.
