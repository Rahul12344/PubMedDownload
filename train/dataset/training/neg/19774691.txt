Susceptibility for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection may be
influenced by host genetics. Recent findings with a Wistar rat model raised the
possibility that the gamma-secretase pathway may be associated with an
individual's susceptibility to infection. A functional single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the gamma-secretase component APH1B (Phe217Leu; rs1047552) 
was therefore analyzed for association with HIV-1 infection. The SNP showed a
tendency for association with HIV-1 infection in a Xhosa indigenous South African
Bantu study (P = 0.087), and associated significantly in a Caucasian Dutch study 
(P = 0.049). Together, the results suggest a role for the gamma-secretase pathway
in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.
