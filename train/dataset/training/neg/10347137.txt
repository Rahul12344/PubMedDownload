Recently, transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) was discovered to be a potential
causative agent for non-A-E hepatitis. Little is known about the relation between
TTV and the clinical courses of various types of acute viral hepatitis. One
hundred twenty-five patients with acute viral hepatitis who were admitted to the 
Chiba University Hospital between 1984 and 1998 and 100 persons with normal liver
function tests were tested for the presence of TTV in their sera. Serum samples
were tested for TTV DNA and genotype by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV DNA 
was detected in 15 of 35 patients (43%) with non-A-E hepatitis, 14 of 33 patients
(42%) with hepatitis C, 8 of 28 patients (29%) with hepatitis A, 7 of 29 patients
(24%) with hepatitis B, and 37 of 100 subjects with normal liver function tests
(37%). The detection rate did not differ statistically between non-A-E hepatitis 
and hepatitis A, B, C, or controls. The distribution of TTV genotypes was similar
in non-A-E, A, B, C types, and controls. The clinical characteristics of the
acute illnesses were similar for patients with or without TTV in hepatitis
non-A-E, A, B, or C. Although TTV was detected frequently in non-A-E acute
hepatitis, no etiologic role for TTV could be established.
