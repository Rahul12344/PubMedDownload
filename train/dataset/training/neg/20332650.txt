OBJECTIVES: To characterize morphological, physicochemical and genomic features
of a novel virulent coliphage which was isolated from an engineered Escherichia
coli culture and termed engineered E. coli phage (EEP).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Electron microscopy revealed that EEP has an icosahedral
head (62 nm in diameter) and a long, flexible tail (138 nm in length). EEP was
able to infect all 10 engineered E. coli strains kept in our laboratory, showing 
a strong ability to lyse engineered E. coli. Sequencing of the EEP genome
revealed a double-stranded DNA (39.8 kb) with 54.72% GC content. Fifty-two open
reading frames were predicted to be coding sequences, 18 of which were
functionally defined and organized in a modular format, which includes modules
for DNA replication, DNA packaging, structural proteins and host cell lysis. This
phage could not be inactivated at 90 degrees for 45 min and was resistant to
ethanol and alkali treatment. EEP is assigned to the Siphoviridae family based on
its morphological, genomic and physicochemical properties.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel coliphage was isolated from engineered E. coli strains, and 
its morphological, genomic and physicochemical properties were characterized,
which will improve our knowledge of bacteriophage diversity.
