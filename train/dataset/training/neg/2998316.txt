The inflammatory response in the synovium of a patient with Ross River arbovirus 
infection.

Hazelton RA, Hughes C, Aaskov JG.

Ross River virus has been incriminated in the etiology of many sporadic and
epidemic cases of polyarthritis in Australia and the Pacific. Both synovium and
synovial exudate fluid recovered from the knee of an epidemic polyarthritis
patient showed a predominantly mononuclear leucocyte infiltrate. Infectious virus
could not be recovered from the synovial exudate. Functional natural killer cells
were detected in the synovial fluid. Their level of cytotoxic activity was
similar to that detected in the peripheral circulation.
