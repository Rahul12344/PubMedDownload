Interaction of mutant lambda repressors with operator and non-operator DNA.

Nelson HC, Sauer RT.

We have described a set of mutations that alter side-chains on the operator
binding surface of lambda repressor. In this paper, we study the interactions of 
12 purified mutant repressors with operator and non-operator DNA. The mutant
proteins have operator affinities that are reduced from tenfold to greater than
10,000-fold compared to wild-type. Nine of the mutants have affinities for
non-operator DNA that are similar to wild-type, two mutants show decreased
non-specific binding, and one mutant has increased affinity for non-operator DNA.
We discuss these findings in terms of the structural and energetic contributions 
of side-chain--DNA interactions, and show that certain contacts between the
repressor and the operator backbone contribute both energy and specificity to the
interaction.
