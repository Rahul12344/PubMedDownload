A patient with fever, and haemorrhagic symptoms was admitted to a hospital in
Glasgow on 2 October 2012. Since he had returned from Afghanistan, serum samples 
were sent for diagnosis at the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory, where a
real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR diagnosis of Crimean â€“ Congo haemorrhagic
fever was made within 3 hrs after receipt of the sample. Hereafter the patient
was transferred to a high-security infectious diseases unit in London but died on
6 October.
