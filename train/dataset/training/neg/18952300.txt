In recent years it has become clear that cell-mediated immunity is playing a role
in the control of lentivirus infections. In particular, cytotoxic T lymphocyte
responses have been associated with improved outcome of infection, especially
those directed against the regulatory proteins like Rev and Tat, which are
expressed early after infection. Therefore, there is considerable interest in
lentiviral vaccine candidates that can induce these types of immune responses. In
the present study, we describe the construction and characterisation of
expression vectors based on recombinant Semliki Forest virus system and modified 
vaccinia virus Ankara for the expression of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
accessory proteins Rev and OrfA. These recombinant viral vectors were used to
immunize cats using a prime-boost regimen and the protective efficacy of this
vaccination strategy was assessed after challenge infection of immunized cats
with FIV.
