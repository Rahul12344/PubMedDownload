The impact of interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) hepatitis C
virus (HCV) treatments on utilization and outcomes associated with HCV-positive
deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) is largely unknown. Using the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we identified 25 566 HCV-positive
DDLT recipients from 2005 to 2015 and compared practices according to the
introduction of DAA therapies using modified Poisson regression. The proportion
of HCV-positive recipients who received HCV-positive livers increased from 6.9%
in 2010 to 16.9% in 2015. HCV-positive recipients were 61% more likely to receive
an HCV-positive liver after 2010 (early DAA/IFN era) (aRR:1.45 1.611.79 , p <
0.001) and almost three times more likely to receive one after 2013 (IFN-free DAA
era) (aRR:2.58 2.853.16 , p < 0.001). Compared to HCV-negative livers,
HCV-positive livers were 3 times more likely to be discarded from 2005 to 2010
(aRR:2.69 2.993.34 , p < 0.001), 2.2 times more likely after 2010 (aRR:1.80
2.162.58 , p < 0.001) and 1.7 times more likely after 2013 (aRR:1.37 1.682.04 , p
< 0.001). Donor HCV status was not associated with increased risk of all-cause
graft loss (p = 0.1), and this did not change over time (p = 0.8). Use of
HCV-positive livers has increased dramatically, coinciding with the advent of
DAAs. However, the discard rate remains nearly double that of HCV-negative
livers. Further optimization of HCV-positive liver utilization is necessary to
improve access for all candidates.
