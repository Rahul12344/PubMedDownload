OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the biological activities of VP3 protein of bluetongue
virus (BTV) expressed in insect cells and to assemble, in future, the BTV
core-like particles.
METHODS: First, full length of BTV13 L3 cDNA was constructed from 2 sequenced
clones. The silver staining of the splicing region proved that the construction
was correct. Then, a recombinant baculovirus expression vector pFB1BL3 was
constructed to express the L3 gene in insect cells.
RESULTS: BTV13 VP3 could be highly expressed in Sf-9 cells, the production could 
occupy up to 10%-15% of the total cell protein. Core-like particles could be
observed after co-expression of the VP3 and VP7 in insect cells.
CONCLUSION: VP3 of BTV expressed in insect cells possesses biological activity
and can be used to assemble BTV core-like particles.
