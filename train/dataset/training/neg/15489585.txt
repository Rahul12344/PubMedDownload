BACKGROUND: Studies of viral hepatitis C have suggested that fibrosis can
regress, at least in patients with sustained virological response. A recent study
suggested that cirrhosis was reversible in sustained and non-virological
responders.
AIM: To study fibrosis progression rate and cirrhosis reversion in patients
treated for severe fibrosis with interferon or interferon + ribavirin.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were treated with interferon +
ribavirin and 64 with interferon. The Metavir fibrosis score and the
semiquantitative fibrosis score (SFS) were used to assess fibrosis.
RESULTS: In sustained responders, fibrosis progression rate decreased from 0.26
Metavir unit (interquartile range: 0.19-0.34) to -0.67 (-0.67 to 0) (P < 0.0001) 
and from 0.81 SFS unit (0.48-1.13) to -1.33 (-3.67 to 0) (P < 0.0001). In
non-responders, fibrosis progression rate decreased from 0.25 Metavir unit
(0.17-0.33) before treatment to 0 (0-0) during treatment (P = 0.002) and from
0.63 SFS unit (0.49-1.12) to 0 (-2.67-1.33) (P = 0.18). Six out of 18 (33%)
sustained virological responders and four of 43 (9%) non-responders regressed
from cirrhosis (F4) to severe fibrosis (F3) (P = 0.058). No patient with
cirrhosis had a decrease of Metavir fibrosis score of 2 points.
CONCLUSION: Interferon can slow fibrosis progression in sustained virological
responders with severe fibrosis. In patients with a non-virological response and 
treated for 12 months the fibrosis progression rate was nil, meaning that only
fibrosis stabilization could be obtained in these patients. Then, longer
treatment duration (3-4 years) could be evaluated in non-virological responders.
