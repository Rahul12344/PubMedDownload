The frequency of H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in China and Eastern Europe has
raised concern in the world health community regarding the potential for an
influenza pandemic. Efforts to monitor the disease will only provide minimal
warning in a global society, and steps must be taken to prevent the morbidity and
mortality associated with past pandemics. The current stockpiling of
antibody-inducing "bird flu" vaccines assumes the strain that emerges will be the
same as strains currently circulating. We propose a novel consensus-based
approach to vaccine development, employing a DNA vaccine strategy that can
provide more highly cross-reactive cellular immunity against lethal influenza
infection. We show such constructs can induce strong cellular immunity against H5
influenza antigens.
