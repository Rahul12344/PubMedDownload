PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Access to first-line antiretroviral therapy in
resource-limited settings has increased rapidly in the last 5 years. Newer
medicines with greater potency and better safety profiles open the possibility
for improving first-line antiretroviral therapy for developing countries.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several medicines offer the potential to improve the simplicity,
safety and efficacy of first-line antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited
settings. These include tenofovir, raltegravir, elvitegravir, rilpivirine and
protease inhibitors. A number of clinical questions are outstanding, particularly
regarding safety in pregnancy and compatibility with drugs to treat common
coinfections including tuberculosis.
SUMMARY: Simple, affordable regimens were key to the initial emergency response, 
but the long-term response to HIV calls for a reconsideration of current
treatment options. Preconditions for widespread use in developing countries
include affordability, simplicity and answers to relevant research questions. In 
the absence of strong pharmacovigilance systems, cohort monitoring will be
critical to assessing the safety profile of new drugs in such settings.
