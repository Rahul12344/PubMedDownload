Dengue outbreaks have occurred in several Brazilian States since 1986 involving
serotypes 1 (DEN-1) and 2 (DEN-2). In view of the few cases of double infection
documented in the literature, we report here a case of simultaneous infection
with DEN-1 and DEN-2 in a patient residing in the municipality of Miranda, State 
of Mato Grosso do Sul, Western region of Brazil. DEN-1 was introduced in this
State in 1989 and DEN-2 in 1996, both of them circulating in some municipalities.
This double infection was identified by virus isolation and by indirect
immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies and confirmed by the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). This is the first documented case of simultaneous infection
with serotypes DEN-1 and DEN-2 in Brazil.
