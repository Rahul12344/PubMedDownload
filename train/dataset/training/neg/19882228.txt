Viral isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), dot blot hybridization (DBH),
and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) were used for the
diagnosis of lumpy skin disease in clinically infected, fevered, and apparently
normal dairy cows. Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) was isolated from skin
biopsies and blood samples collected from clinically infected cows in percentages
of 72% and 20%, respectively. The virus recovered from blood samples collected
from fevered cows in percentage of 33.3%. Both PCR and DBH detected viral DNA in 
100% of skin biopsies collected from clinically infected cows whereas the
detection rates in blood samples collected from clinically infected animals were 
100% and 84% using PCR and DBH, respectively. Viral DNA was detected in blood
samples collected from fevered cows using PCR and DBH in percentages of 77.8% and
66.6%, respectively. Only 19.1% of blood samples collected from in-contact cows
was positive for both of PCR and DBH. Detection rates of antibodies against LSDV 
using iELISA in serum samples collected from clinically infected and fevered cows
were 56% and 11.1%, respectively, whereas all in-contact cows had no antibodies
against the virus.
