To evaluate a non-marketed research prototype of a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay
for detection of herpes simplex virus in genital lesions, 154 clinical specimens 
were collected from 127 men and 27 women with symptoms suggestive of herpes
simplex virus infection (erythema, vesicles, ulcers and crustae). The samples
were tested using the assay and cultures on four monolayers of human embryonic
lung fibroblasts and Vero cells. When the culture was used as reference method,
sensitivity was 76.9% and specificity 100% (prevalence 42.4%). Comparison of
results by patient group showed that sensitivity was highest in material from
patients with vesicles and ulcers. The highest sensitivity was obtained in
specimens which developed a cytopathological effect within 48 h and in specimens 
with three or four positive cell cultures. These findings suggest that the assay 
is more successful in specimens with high virus titres. The enzyme immunoassay
was found to be a rapid, moderately sensitive, highly specific test for detection
of herpes simplex virus from genital lesions, but the usefulness of the assay is 
limited and culture methods should be preferred.
