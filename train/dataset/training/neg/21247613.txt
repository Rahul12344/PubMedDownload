It has been known for some time that retroviruses can disseminate between immune 
cells either by conventional cell-free transmission or by directed cell-to-cell
spread. Over the past few years there has been increasing interest in how
retroviruses may use cell-to-cell spread to promote more rapid infection kinetics
and circumvent humoral immunity. Effective humoral immune responses are
intimately linked with innate immunity and the interplay between retroviruses and
innate immunity is a rapidly expanding area of research that has been advanced
considerably by the identification of cellular restriction factors that provide
barriers to retroviral infection. The effect of innate immunity and restriction
factors on retroviral cell-to-cell spread has been comparatively little studied; 
however recent work suggests this maybe changing. Here I will review some recent 
advances in what is a budding area of retroviral research.
