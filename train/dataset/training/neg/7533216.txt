The binding of the 28 kDa yeast TATA binding protein (yTBP) to the HIV and adeno 
major late promoters has been examined by electron microscopy (EM). Three
different EM preparative methods were employed: direct mounting and shadowcasting
of fixed samples, cryofixation and freeze-drying followed by shadowcasting, and
negative staining of unfixed samples. Excellent agreement among the three methods
was obtained. With ten yTBP monomers/DNA fragment, up to 25% of the DNA molecules
contained easily distinguished protein particles at the TATA box and, less
frequently, smaller particles were observed. Non-specific binding to DNA ends was
common. The mass of the easily distinguished particles measured 63(+/- 5) kDa
(cryofixation and shadowcasting) and 48(+/- 6) kDa (negative staining) indicating
TBP dimerization. With 22 and 44 yTBP monomers/DNA, yTBP polymerization produced 
DNA-protein rods 9 nm wide and 20 to 30 nm long, frequently with two DNA strands 
exiting one end. Bending analysis revealed that yTBP dimers bend the DNA about
the TATA box by 80 to 90 degrees. Although these protein ratios are relatively
high, the structures formed demonstrate the propensity of yTBP to engage in
protein-protein interactions.
