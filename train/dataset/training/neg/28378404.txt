Cytology-based cervical cancer screening is restricted because of a lack of
cytologists. Thus, HPV-based instead of cytology-based screening may be a more
suitable strategy in China. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of HPV testing
(Cobas® 4800 Test, Roche) and HPV-based programs to detect high-grade cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer compared with cytology (Thinprep,
Hologic) and cytology-based programs through a cross-sectional study in 11,064
Chinese women aged 21-65 years who were enrolled from Longyou County in Zhejiang 
Province, China. The rates of HPV positivity and cytology abnormality were 9.8%
and 6.1%, respectively. The HPV positivity rate had two age peaks, 21-24 (15.4%) 
and 60-65 (14.4%) years. According to adjusted data, HPV testing demonstrated
significantly higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) than
cytology for detecting CIN2 or worse (90.0% vs. 66.7%, 99.9% vs. 99.5%), and
there was an acceptable specificity (91.3%) and positive predictive value (PPV,
12.5%). Furthermore, primary HPV testing with type 16/18 genotyping showed the
highest sensitivity (78.6%) and NPV (99.7%) among four screening strategies, and 
there was similar specificity (96.8%) and PPV (23.9%) compared with co-testing
screening to detect CIN2+, while there were fewer colposcopies (4.2) and tests
(106.3) performed than with co-testing and primary cytology screening to detect a
case of high-grade CIN. The differences in effectiveness were approximately
similar when CIN3+ was the identifying target. Our findings suggest that primary 
HPV testing with type 16/18 genotyping has a higher sensitivity and NPV,
possesses optimal cost/effectiveness in the first round of screening and is a
feasible strategy of cervical cancer screening for Chinese women.
