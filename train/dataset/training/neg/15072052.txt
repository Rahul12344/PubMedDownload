Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a large DNA virus that is well equipped to evade 
host immune responses and able to establish lifelong latency. It is able to
modulate both innate and adaptive immune reactivity, and has multiple effects on 
the cell cycle and apoptosis. It is a major opportunistic pathogen in
immunocompromised hosts. Reactivation of latent virus may re-stimulate memory
T-cell responses that are sufficient to re-establish control over viral
replication if the degree of immune suppression is not too great. Following
allogeneic transplantation immune responses are often inadequate resulting in
progressive tissue damage manifesting as over HCMV disease that usually presents 
as pneumonitis, colitis or hepatitis. Currently available antiviral
pharmacotherapies are limited by toxicities and lack of efficacy in established
HCMV disease. Efforts have therefore focused on molecular diagnostic surveillance
protocols that allow earlier intervention, and the development of adoptive
immunotherapeutic strategies to hasten host immune reconstruction.
