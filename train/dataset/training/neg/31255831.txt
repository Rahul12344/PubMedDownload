Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation
in β-globin (HBB) gene. We have generated an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
line, IGIBi001-A from an Indian sickle cell patient with a homozygous HBB gene
mutation using Sendai virus reprogramming system. Characterization of IGIBi001-A 
showed that these iPSCs are transgene-free and expressed pluripotent stem cell
markers. They had a normal karyotype and were able to differentiate into all
three germ layers. This new SCD-iPSC line will contribute to better understanding
of the disease biology of sickle cell anemia and for screening of small molecule 
drugs.
