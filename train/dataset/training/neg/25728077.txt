Herpes simplex virus (HSV) ocular infection causes significant visual burden
worldwide. Despite the fact that dendritic or geographic corneal ulcers are
typical findings in HSV epithelial keratitis, conjunctival ulcer as a sign of HSV
infection has rarely been reported. Although easily overlooked, this important
sign could be enhanced by fluorescein staining. We report two cases of
conjunctival geographic ulcers proven to be HSV infection by viral isolation and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One patient had bilateral disease and
blepharitis, and the other had unilateral involvement without skin lesions. With 
timely diagnosis and proper management, excellent visual outcome can be expected.
