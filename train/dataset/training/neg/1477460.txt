A gene amplification method of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) has been devised. A primer pair used in this study is
5'GTTGCCGTGGCGG TATCGG3' and 5'GCGACATTACGGGGCAGGTGG3', which brackets a 152-base
region encoding the 65KD antigen, and a specific probe is
5'TTTGGGGTCATCTTTGGAGCG3'. The procedure could be completed within 2 days. The
specificity and the sensitivity of the PCR for M. tuberculosis complex in
identifying M. tuberculosis complex did not conflict with the conventional
methods at all. Using this method, we could diagnose three cases of the disease, 
which had been very difficult to diagnose by the conventional methods, by
detecting the DNA from the blood, liver biopsy specimen, lung aspirate, and
pleural effusion.
