This review focuses on current developments in the field of nanostructured bulk
polymers and their application in bioengineering and therapeutic sciences. In
contrast to well-established nanoscale materials, such as nanoparticles and
nanofibers, bulk nanostructured polymers combine nanoscale structure in a
macroscopic construct, which enables unique application of these materials.
Contemporary fabrication and processing techniques capable of producing
nanoporous polymer films are reviewed. Focus is placed on techniques capable of
sub-100 nm features since this range approaches the size scale of biological
components, such as proteins and viruses. The attributes of these techniques are 
compared, with an emphasis on the characteristic advantages and limitations of
each method. Finally, application of these materials to biofiltration,
immunoisolation, and drug delivery are reviewed.
