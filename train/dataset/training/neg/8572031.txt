OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study was designed to determine the incidence of
B19 associated with idiopathic nonimmune hydrops fetalis by use of a sensitive
molecular tool, the polymerase chain reaction assay.
STUDY DESIGN: Placental and fetal tissues from 57 cases of nonimmune hydrops
fetalis were analyzed for B19 deoxyribonucleic acid. Thirty-four of these cases
were classified as idiopathic. The remaining 23 cases had known,
noninfectious-based causes.
RESULTS: Eighteen percent of all cases (6/34) of idiopathic nonimmune hydrops
fetalis contained B19 deoxyribonucleic acid. In contrast, none of the 23 cases of
known, noninfectious-based nonimmune hydrops fetalis examined contained any B19
deoxyribonucleic acid. Presence of the virus was confirmed in each of the six
cases by either B19-specific deoxyribonucleic acid in situ hybridization or
immunocytochemistry. However, histologic examination was unsuccessful at
detecting characteristic viral-like inclusions in one third of the cases.
CONCLUSION: Eighteen percent of cases of idiopathic nonimmune hydrops fetalis
contained B19 deoxyribonucleic acid. This significant finding demonstrates the
usefulness of polymerase chain reaction to aid in the differential diagnosis of
this disease.
