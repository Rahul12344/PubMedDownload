RNA templates yield the corresponding DNA in the presence of human
immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT). The purpose of this
study was to determine whether RNA that was modified with either
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro analogs or with internucleotide phosphorothioate linkages
could serve as templates for HIV-1 RT. Modified RNA that contained either
2'-deoxy 2'-fluoro pyrimidine nucleoside analogs or internucleotide
phosphorothioate diester linkages 5'- to pyrimidine nucleosides were
enzymatically synthesized and tested for template activity with recombinant HIV-1
RT. RNA that was modified with either 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine or with
internucleotide phosphorothioate linkages 5'- to pyrimidines yielded full length 
HIV-1 reverse transcription products, with complete fidelity in transcription.
RNA that was modified with 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine, either alone or in
combination with 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine, did not function as templates for
HIV-1 RT, under the conditions reported here. The ability of
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-modified and phosphorothioate-modified RNA to serve as
template for the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase of HIV-1 RT has not hitherto been
reported.
