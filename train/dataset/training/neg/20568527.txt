A viroid-like disease causing mosaic leaves and dwarfism was found on mulberry
plants in Zhejiang, China. Grafting of stems from infected plants onto healthy
plants resulted in the same symptoms on the healthy plants. A circular small RNA 
(Mmd-v RNA1) was isolated from the infected plant leaves and caused identical
symptoms after more than two years. Nucleotide sequencing indicated that the
Mmd-v RNA1 contains 356 nt (GenBank accession no. NC_011362) without viroid
characteristic regions, only sharing 30 nt sequence identity with that of the
Cherry small circular viroid-like RNA 1 (isolate cscRNA1.150, GenBank accession
no. DQ357628). This description is the first of viroid-like RNA infection of
mulberry trees.
