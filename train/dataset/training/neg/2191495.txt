Thirty-eight new nonsense mutants of the lipid-containing bacteriophage PR4 were 
isolated. These mutants define seven new viral genes, including the gene encoding
the terminal genome protein and an accessory lytic factor. The defective gene
products produced in uv-irradiated cells infected with representative mutants
from each of the new genetic groups were identified using sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Extracts of uv-irradiated 
cells infected with nonsense mutants that produce a defective major capsid
protein, P2, also lacked two lower molecular weight proteins. The synthesis of
all three protein species was recovered in cells infected with one-step
revertants of two independent major capsid protein mutants, suggesting the
possibility of post-translational processing or overlapping genes. The time
course of protein synthesis in wild-type PR4-infected cells was examined using
SDS-PAGE. These analyses revealed at least 34 proteins produced following phage
PR4 infection that were not present in uninfected control cultures.
