The products of gene A of the related phages Mu and D108 differ in their
specificities.

Toussaint A, Faelen M, Desmet L, Allet B.

By recombination between different mutants of mutator phages Mu and D108, we
isolated a set of viable hybrids. The structure of the hybrids was analyzed by
digestion with different restriction enzymes. Genetic studies show that hybrids
which carry the left end of the Mu genome complement a mini-Mu deleted from
within the A gene as well as Mu while hybrids with the left end of the D108
genome or D108 do not. Vice versa, hybrids with the left end of the D108 genome
or D108, but not hybrids with the left end of the Mu genome or Mu complement a
mini-D108 deleted from within the A gene. The nucleotide sequence of the A gene
of Mu and its equivalent on D108 are mainly similar except on their left end.
These observations demonstrate that the two pA products, although only partially 
different, have different specificities.
