Interspecies antigenic determinants of structural proteins of mammalian type-C
viruses as detected by a competitive sepharose bead immunofluorescence assay.

Micheel B, Fiebach H, Wunderlich V.

The present paper describes a competitive immunoassay using antiserum to FeLV p
27 and SSV-conjugated Sepharose beads. The assay is applied to compare the
interspecies-specific antigenic determinants of the major structural proteins of 
type-C viruses of different mammalian species. The test proves to be highly
sensitive and specific and may be used for the demonstration of viral proteins in
crude cellular extracts.
