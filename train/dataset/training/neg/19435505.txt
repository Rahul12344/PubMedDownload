BACKGROUND: An unprecedented high proportion of oseltamivir resistant influenza
A(H1N1) viruses emerged in the 2007-08 influenza season. In Norway, two thirds of
all tested A(H1N1) viruses were resistant to the antiviral drug. In order to see 
if this emergence could be explained by a drug induced selection pressure, we
analysed data on the sales of oseltamivir in Norway for the years 2002-07.
METHODS: We used data from two sources; the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics 
Database and the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD), for the years
2002-2007. We calculated courses sold of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) per 1000
inhabitants per year.
RESULTS: Our data showed that, except for the years 2005 and 2006, sales of
oseltamivir were low in Norway; courses sold per 1000 inhabitants varied between 
0.17-1.64. The higher sales in 2005 and 2006 we believe were caused by private
stockpiling in fear of a pandemic, and do not represent actual usage.
CONCLUSION: A drug induced selection pressure was probably not the cause of the
emergence of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses in 2007-08 in
Norway.
