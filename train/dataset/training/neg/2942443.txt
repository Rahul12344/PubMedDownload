Use of the lysis gene of bacteriophage phi X174 for the construction of a
positive selection vector.

Henrich B, Plapp R.

DNA fragments generated by a variety of restriction enzymes can easily be cloned 
in the small (3.2-kb) positive-selection vector pUH84, which contains the
modified lysis gene of bacteriophage phi X174 under transcriptional control of
the lac promoter. Plasmid pUH84 does not yield transformants after introduction
into Escherichia coli unless the lysis gene is inactivated by insertion of
foreign DNA into one of the unique PstI, SalI, AccI, HincII, BamHI, or EcoRI
sites. This highly efficient positive selection of recombinants requires neither 
the use of a distinct host strain nor a special induction of the lysis function. 
Transcription of fragments cloned into pUH84 may be effectively regulated by the 
lac promoter provided the host cells are cotransformed with the newly constructed
plasmid pUH7 which carries the IQ allele of the lac repressor gene.
