Infection of the cornea with herpes simplex virus (HSV) can result in a chronic
disease called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK). The disease represents one of
the leading causes of infectious blindness in the Western world. Immune-mediated 
cellular damage is suspected in the pathogenesis of human HSK. The murine model
has been pivotal in further establishing HSK as an immunopathological disease.
This article reviews understanding of HSK, both in humans and in the mouse model,
with an emphasis on possible future therapeutic strategies to counteract this
blinding immunoinflammatory disease.
