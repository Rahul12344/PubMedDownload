N,N-diethylaminoalkoxy-4,7-phenanthrolines and 1,8-diazaflourene derivatives, a
novel class of potential interferon inducers and antiviral agents: interactions
with nucleic acids in vitro and cellular activities.

Tilorone aza-analogues, derivatives of 4,7-phenanthroline and 1,8-diazafluorene, 
were examined as DNA-complexing agents by spectral and electrophoretic methods.
The binding process includes at least two types of interactions: electrostatic
and, possibly, intercalation. Complex formation with the denatured DNA was also
observed, but its nature remained unsolved. Binding and thermodynamic parameters 
were determined. All ligands studied showed weak antiviral activity and
essentially no interferon induction when assayed in vitro and in vivo. It was
concluded that interferon induction by tilorone may involve specific cell
receptors or intermediaries.
