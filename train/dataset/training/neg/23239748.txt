This article investigates how to more effectively conduct risk communication to
increase the probability of successful control of an epidemic in Taiwan. The
epidemic control of H1N1 in Taiwan in 2010 was studied. We used factor analysis
and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to obtain the total
influence for each factor and to determine the critical factors among them. After
being processed using proposed operational procedures, we obtained the critical
factors and found that the government plays the key role in successful epidemic
control. To reduce the resistance to efforts that seek to prevent pandemic
crises, some necessary intervention activities, such as fairly and honorably
exploring the complete relevant information and revealing the side effects of
vaccines in a manner that is easily understood, were recommended. These could
lead to an increase in immunizations among Taiwanese people by gaining their
trust and commitment, thus achieving control of this epidemic.
