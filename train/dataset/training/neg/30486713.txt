The use of phylogenetics in HIV molecular epidemiology has considerably increased
our ability to understand the origin, spread, and characteristics of HIV
epidemics. Despite its potential to advance knowledge on HIV transmission
dynamics, the ethical issues associated with HIV molecular epidemiology have
received minimal attention. In-depth interviews were conducted with scientists
from diverse backgrounds to explore their perspectives on ethical issues
associated with phylogenetic analysis of HIV genetic data as applied to HIV
transmission dynamics studies. The Emanuel framework was used as the analytical
framework. Favorable risk-benefit ratio and informed consent were the most
invoked ethical principles and fair participant selection the least. Fear of loss
of privacy and disclosure of HIV transmission were invariably cited as key
ethical concerns. As HIV sequence data become increasingly available,
comprehensive guidelines should be developed to guide its access, sharing and
use, cognizant of the potential harms that may result.
