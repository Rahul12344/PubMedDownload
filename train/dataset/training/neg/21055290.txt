OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of mutant hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) 
adenovirus (Adeno-HIF-1α-Ala402-Ala564) on cardiomyocytes (CMCs) differentiation 
from the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) co-cultured with CMCs.
METHODS: Following groups were studied: HIF-1α group (MSCs + CMCs + Ad-HIF-1α),
LacZ group (MSCs + CMCs + Ad-LacZ), Sham group (MSCs + CMCs + PBS) and MSC +
HIF-1α Group (MSCs + Ad-HIF-1α). MSCs were co-cultured with myocardial cells in
proportion of MSCs:CMCs 1:2, after 24 hours, cells were infect with virus (MOI = 
100) or treated with PBS, cardiac troponin (cTnT) expression in MSCs was detected
7 days post infection by immunochemical analysis, mRNA expression of HIF-1α,
TGF-β(1), Smad4, NKx2.5, GATA-4 was also detected by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: HIF-1α increased MSCs differentiation to myocardial cells
(differentiation rate 32.68% ± 6.52% vs. 8.28% ± 0.09% in the LacZ group and
10.25% ± 2.20% in the Sham group and 0.32% ± 0.05% in the MSC group (all P < 0.05
vs. HIF-1α group). mRNA expression of HIF, TGF-β(1), Smad4, NKx2.5 and GATA-4 was
also significantly upregulated in HIF-1α group all P < 0.05 vs. Sham group).
CONCLUSION: HIF-1α promoted MSCs, co-cultured with myocardial cells,
differentiating to cardiomyocytes via upregulating TGF-β(1)/Smad4 signaling
pathway.
