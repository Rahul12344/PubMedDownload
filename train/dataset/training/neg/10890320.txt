Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection should be assessed by liver biopsy
prior to consideration of anti-viral therapy. Patients with histologically mild
disease should be observed at regular intervals and assessed with a repeat liver 
biopsy after an interval of 3-4 years. Those with severe disease should receive
early treatment with interferon-alpha and ribavirin. The duration of therapy is
determined by the genotype of the infecting virus-viral genotypes 2 and 3 require
only 6 months of treatment but other genotypes should be treated for 12 months.
Approximately 35-40% of treated patients will respond to therapy with a permanent
cessation of viral replication and improvement in liver histology. New therapies 
including polyethylene glycol, PEGylated, interferons and combination regimes
involving amantadine are currently under evaluation and it is hoped that improved
regimes will be developed in the near future.
