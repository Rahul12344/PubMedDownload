DBA/2 mice were injected i.v. with IFN alpha/beta-resistant 3CI8 Friend
erythroleukemia cells (FLC) which metastasize to the liver and spleen. IFN
alpha/beta treatment of FLC-injected mice increased their survival time and these
mice developed a resistance to a second challenge with FLC. The efficacy of IFN
alpha/beta in increasing the survival time was compared between normal
immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. The anti-tumor action of IFN was
markedly reduced or abolished in newborn DBA/2 mice, in adult athymic nu/nu and
beige DBA/2 mice, and in BALB/c scid/scid mice. To determine the phenotype of the
effector cells involved, FLC-injected DBA/2 mice were treated with antibodies to 
asialo-GMI, CD4, or CD8 antigens, or with cyclosporin A or silica. IFN alpha/beta
treatment proved much less effective in these mice, indicating that a variety of 
effector cell types participated in the IFN-induced suppression of visceral
metastases. Thus, an intact immune system appears to be essential to obtain
optimal therapeutic effects of IFN alpha/beta in this experimental model.
