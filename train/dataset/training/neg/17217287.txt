Przewalskin B (1), a novel diterpenoid possessing a unique skeleton, was isolated
from a Chinese medicinal plant Salvia przewalskii. Its structure and relative
stereochemistry were elucidated by extensive NMR analysis and a single-crystal
X-ray study. A possible biosynthetic pathway for 1 was proposed. Compound 1
exhibited modest anti-HIV-1 activity with EC50 = 30 microg/mL. [structure: see
text].
