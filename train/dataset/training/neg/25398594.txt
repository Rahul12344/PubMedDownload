Aichi virus, a causative agent of human gastroenteritis, is one of a number of
animal viruses belonging to the genus Kobuvirus within the family Picornaviridae.
The kobuvirus genome encodes several structural and nonstructural proteins; the
capsid proteins encoded by the VP1 gene are key immunogenic factors. Here, we
used the VP1 region to determine substitution rates and the time to the most
recent common ancestor (TMRCA) by comparing feline kobuvirus (FKoVs) sequences
with kobuvirus sequences isolated from members of other species. The substitution
rate for FKoVs was 1.29 × 10(-2 )substitutions/site/year (s/s/y) and the TMRCA
was 5.3 years.
