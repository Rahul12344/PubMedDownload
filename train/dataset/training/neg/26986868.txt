The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection shows variable rate of disease
progression. The underlying biological and molecular mechanisms involved in
determining progression of HIV infection are not fully understood. The aims of
this study were to determine plasma concentrations of active TGF β 1, Th1 and Th2
cytokines in patients with non-progressive and those with progressive HIV-1
infection, as well as to determine if there is an association of these cytokines 
to disease progression. In a cross-sectional study of 61 HIV-1 infected
individuals categorized according to disease progression as having
non-progressive HIV-1 infection (n=14) and progressive infection (n=47), plasma
levels of active TGF β 1, INF-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-13 were
compared with HIV uninfected healthy controls (n=12). Plasma concentration of
these cytokines was measured using a highly sensitive luminex200 XMAP assay.
Pearson correlation test was used to assess the correlation of cytokines with
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4:CD8 ratio and plasma HIV-1 RNA in the different study 
groups. Plasma concentrations of TGF β 1 and IL-10 were significantly decreased
while IL-1β, IL-12p70 and TNF-α were increased in patients with non-progressive
HIV-1 infection compared to patients with progressive infection. Plasma levels of
TGF β 1 and IL-10 showed an inverse correlation with CD8+ T cell counts and
CD4:CD8 ratios in patients with non-progressive HIV-1 infection, while plasma
HIV-1 RNA positively correlated with CD4+ T cell counts. Plasma levels of TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-13 positively correlated with CD4+ T cell counts and
inversely correlated with plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD8+ T cell count and CD4:CD8 ratio
in patients with non-progressive infection. The correlation of cytokines to the
state of T-lymphocyte and plasma HIV-1 RNA found in this study may provide
insight into the role of cytokines in both progressive and non-progressive HIV-1 
infection. Additionally, these findings may have implications for systemic
cytokine-based therapies in HIV-1 infection.
