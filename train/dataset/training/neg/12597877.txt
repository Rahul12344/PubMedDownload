Deoxynucleoside monophosphate kinase (dNMP kinase) of bacteriophage T5 (EC
2.7.4.13) was purified to apparent homogeneity from phage-infected Escherichia
coli cells. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel showed
that the enzyme has a molecular mass of about 29 kDa. The molecular mass of dNMP 
kinase estimated by analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation turned out to be
29.14 +/- 3.03 kDa. These data suggest that the enzyme exists in solution as a
monomer. The isoelectric point of dNMP kinase was found to be 4.2. The N-terminal
amino acid sequence, comprising 21 amino acids, was determined to be
VLVGLHGEAGSGKDGVAKLII. A comparison of this amino acid sequence and those of
known enzymes with a similar function suggests the presence of a
nucleotide-binding site in the sequenced region.
