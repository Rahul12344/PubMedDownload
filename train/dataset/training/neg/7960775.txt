Infectious mononucleosis is found worldwide. The clinical manifestations vary
widely. We report a case with impressive swelling of the hard and soft palate.
Inflammation in the region of the efferent ducts of the palatinal glands resulted
in congestion in the region of the mucinous salivary glands. The subsequent
secretory stasis caused degeneration of the acini and rupture of a salivary
retention cyst. The surrounding connective tissue was soaked with mucin, and
unspecific chronic granular inflammation was found. Immunohistochemical
examination with a monoclonal EBV antibody was necessary to show that the
exceptional clinical picture was due to infectious mononucleosis.
