This study analyzed the genes pol and env to determine the genetic variability of
HIV-1 in Central Brazil. Forty-one isolates of HIV-1-infected individuals had
protease, reverse transcriptase, and C2C3/ env amplified by nested PCR and
sequenced. The subtype was determined by the program REGA and phylogenetic
analyses. The samples identified as putative recombinant forms were analyzed by
SimPlot. A high prevalence of subtype B (95.1%) was observed, followed by mosaic 
viruses B/F (4.9%). The amino acid sequences from 30 HIV-1 isolates were analyzed
for the antigenic intrasubtype diversity. The most prevalent gp120 V3 loop motif 
was the GPGR (United States/Europe) (43.3%), described in B and F subtypes,
followed by the GPGK tetrapeptide (10%). The Brazilian variant B" (GWGR), GFGR,
and GLGR tetrapeptides were found in 6.7%. Other V3 variants were found in eight 
isolates (26.7%). Phylogenetic tree analysis was also performed in order to
verify the relationship of the HIV-1 samples from Central Brazil with other HIV-1
sequences that circulate in Brazil. The subtype B sequences from Central Brazil
formed a polyphyletic cluster in the tree, indicating that these strains are
similar to those from other geographic regions. These results contribute to the
understanding of HIV in Brazil, and may prove useful for the development of
vaccine candidates.
