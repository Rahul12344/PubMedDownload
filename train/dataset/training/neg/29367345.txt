Resistance to oncolytic virotherapy is frequently associated with failure of
tumor cells to get infected by the virus. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a common
treatment for psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, also has anticancer properties.
We show that DMF and various fumaric and maleic acid esters (FMAEs) enhance viral
infection of cancer cell lines as well as human tumor biopsies with several
oncolytic viruses (OVs), improving therapeutic outcomes in resistant syngeneic
and xenograft tumor models. This results in durable responses, even in models
otherwise refractory to OV and drug monotherapies. The ability of DMF to enhance 
viral spread results from its ability to inhibit type I interferon (IFN)
production and response, which is associated with its blockade of nuclear
translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This study
demonstrates that unconventional application of U.S. Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs and biological agents can result in improved
anticancer therapeutic outcomes.
