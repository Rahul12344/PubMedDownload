OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of renal
function and liver enzyme abnormalities among HIV-infected children, changes in
prevalence with time on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and the
factors associated with these abnormalities.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected children <
18 years old (n = 705) who were on first-line cART. Liver enzymes, renal
function, haematology, immunology and virological response were assessed at
enrolment and followed bi-annually for 18 months. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis
were assessed using noninvasive markers including the aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis score (FIB-4).
RESULTS: The median age was 12 [interquartile range (IQR) 8-14] years; 53.3% of
patients were male. At enrolment, the median cART duration was 3.3 (IQR 1.1-6.1) 
years; 177 (25.1%) and 83 (11.8%) patients had elevated AST and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), respectively. A tenth of the children had an APRI score >
0.5, suggesting liver fibrosis. Being on a zidovudine (ZDV)- or nevirapine
(NVP)-based regimen and having a viral load > 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were
significantly associated with elevated ALT. Twenty-four (3.4%) and 84 (12.1%)
patients had elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respectively. As 
cART duration increased by 6 months, median BUN increased by 1.6 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.4-2.7] mg/dL (P = 0.01); the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
decreased by 35.6 (95% CI 17.7-53.4) mL/min/1.73 m2 (P < 0.0001); and AST and ALT
decreased by 1.4 (95% CI 0.4-2.5) IU/L (P = 0.01) and 1.4 (95% CI 0.2-2.6) IU/L
(P = 0.01), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of liver enzyme and renal function abnormalities
was observed at enrolment. Decreasing liver enzyme levels during follow-up are
possibly reassuring, while the progressive reduction in GFR and the increase in
BUN are worrisome and require further study.
