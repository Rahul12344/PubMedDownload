Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are
prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, together with HIV; the consequent burden of
disease is grave. The cofactors driving transmission of the two viruses and
pathogenesis of associated malignancies are not well understood. We measured KSHV
and EBV DNA in whole blood and saliva as well as serum antibodies levels in 175
Cameroonians with Kaposi's sarcoma and 1,002 age- and sex-matched controls with
and without HIV. KSHV seroprevalence was very high (81%) in controls, while EBV
seroprevalence was 100% overall. KSHV DNA was detectable in the blood of 36-46%
of cases and 6-12% of controls; EBV DNA was detected in most participants
(72-89%). In saliva, more cases (50-58%) than controls (25-28%) shed KSHV,
regardless of HIV infection. EBV shedding was common (75-100%); more HIV+ than
HIV- controls shed EBV. Cases had higher KSHV and EBV VL in blood and saliva then
controls, only among HIV+ participants. KSHV and EBV VL were also higher in HIV+ 
than in HIV- controls. Cases (but not controls) were more likely to have
detectable KSHV in blood if they also had EBV, whereas shedding of each virus in 
saliva was independent. While EBV VL in saliva and blood were modestly
correlated, no correlation existed for KSHV. Numerous factors, several related to
parasitic coinfections, were associated with detection of either virus or with
VL. These findings may help better understand the interplay between the two
gammaherpesviruses and generally among copathogens contributing to cancer burden 
in sub-Saharan Africa.
