BACKGROUND: Fruit bats are known to harbor zoonotic paramyxoviruses including
Nipah, Hendra, and Menangle viruses. The aim of this study was to detect the
presence of paramyxovirus RNA in fruit bats from Indonesia.
METHODS: RNA samples were obtained from the spleens of 110 fruit bats collected
from four locations in Indonesia. All samples were screened by semi-nested broad 
spectrum reverse transcription PCR targeting the paramyxovirus polymerase (L)
genes.
RESULTS: Semi-nested reverse transcription PCR detected five previously
unidentified paramyxoviruses from six fruit bats. Phylogenetic analysis showed
that these virus sequences were related to henipavirus or rubulavirus.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the presence of novel paramyxoviruses among
fruit bat populations in Indonesia.
