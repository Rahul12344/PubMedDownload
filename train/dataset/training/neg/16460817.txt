Among 1330 patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 3
showed 1 or 2 amino acid (aa) insertions at position 35 of the HIV-1 protease
gene. Protease genes containing aa insertions, either in the presence
(ins35G+res.muts, ins35TN+res.muts) or absence (ins35G, ins35TN) of other
resistance mutations, were introduced into the wild-type HIV-1 strain NL4-3. The 
introduction of ins35G and ins35TN in the wild-type protease confirmed that these
mutations were per se not responsible of decreased drug susceptibility. The
replication rate of mutant recombinant viruses was determined by HIV RNA
quantification in supernatants of cell cultures in comparison with a recombinant 
HIV-1 strain with wild-type protease. Recombinant ins35G and ins35TN HIV-1
strains did not display increased resistance to currently used protease
inhibitors (PIs). Comparison of ins35TN+res.muts and ins35G+res.muts with respect
to the corresponding recombinant rescue mutants showed that ins35TN decreased the
replication rate of the PI-resistant strain, while ins35G had a protective
effect.
