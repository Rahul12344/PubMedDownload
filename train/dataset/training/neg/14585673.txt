A DNA vaccine encoding the envelope glycoprotein from a fish rhabdovirus, viral
hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), has previously been shown to induce both
early and long time protection against the virus in rainbow trout. Challenge
experiments have revealed that the immunity established shortly after vaccination
is cross-protective against heterologous fish rhabdoviruses. In this study, we
show that the DNA vaccine encoding the VHSV glycoprotein also induces early
protection against a non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the
Nodavirus family, the Atlantic halibut nodavirus (AHNV). In a vaccine efficacy
test using juvenile turbot as model fish, the fish injected with the VHSV vaccine
were completely protected against a nodavirus challenge performed 8 days post
vaccination, while the cumulative mortality in the control group reached 54%. A
DNA vaccine carrying the gene encoding the capsid protein of AHNV revealed no
protective properties against the nodavirus challenge. Histological examination
of muscle tissue sections from the vaccine injection site showed that the DNA
vaccine against VHSV triggered a pronounced inflammatory response in turbot
similar to what has earlier been observed in rainbow trout.
