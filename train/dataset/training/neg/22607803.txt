Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that are essential for cellular metabolism
but can be functionally disrupted during pathogen infection. In neurons,
mitochondria are transported on microtubules via the molecular motors kinesin-1
and dynein and recruited to energy-requiring regions such as synapses. Previous
studies showed that proteins from pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alphaherpesvirus, 
localize to mitochondria and affect mitochondrial function. We show that PRV and 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of rodent superior cervical
ganglion (SCG) neurons disrupts mitochondrial motility and morphology. During PRV
infection, glycoprotein B (gB)-dependent fusion events result in electrical
coupling of neurons and increased action potential firing rates. Consequently,
intracellular [Ca(2+)] increases and alters mitochondrial dynamics through a
mechanism involving the Ca(2+)-sensitive cellular protein Miro and reduced
recruitment of kinesin-1 to mitochondria. This disruption in mitochondrial
dynamics is required for efficient growth and spread of PRV, indicating that
altered mitochondrial transport enhances alphaherpesvirus pathogenesis and
infection.
