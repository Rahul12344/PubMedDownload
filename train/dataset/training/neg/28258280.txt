Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV core protein is considered as 
a positive regulator of telomerase activity. In this study, we focused on the
deregulated microRNA-138 (miR-138) in HCV-associated HCC. Differential expression
of miR-138 was determined by TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR. The target gene
of miR-138 was verified by luciferase reporter assay, quantitative real-time PCR,
and Western blotting. Moreover, three assays based on telomerase activity, cell
proliferation, and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase activity were performed.
The correlation analysis revealed a significantly negative correlation between
miR-138 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA expression in HCC.
Further, we showed that mature HCV core protein of 173 amino acids, but not
full-length form of 191 amino acids, suppressed miR-138 expression. TERT was
verified as a direct target of miR-138 in HCC cells. Furthermore, TERT-targeting 
miR-138 supplementation can prevent HCV core protein from repressing HCC cell
replicative senescence. Collectively, HCV core protein can enhance TERT protein
expression through downregulating TERT-targeting miR-138 expression, which in
turn inhibits HCC cell replicative senescence. This study may further help our
understanding on the pathogenic mechanisms of HCV core protein in HCV-associated 
HCC development. KEY MESSAGE: miR-138 is downregulated in HCV-associated HCC.
Mature HCV core protein plays a pathogenic role in suppressing miR-138
expression. Telomerase reverse transcriptase represents a direct target of
miR-138 in HCC cells. miR-138 promotes HCC cell senescence, suggesting potential 
for HCC treatment.
