The relationship between infections and autoimmune diseases is complex and there 
are several reports highlighting the role of human endogenous retroviruses
(HERVs) in these patients. The levels of multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus
(MSRV)-type DNA of Env gene was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from 52 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 40
healthy controls using specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. Furthermore, we
analyzed the status of HERV-W/MSRV in these patients with regards to both EBV
(DNA load and anti-EBNA1 IgG antibody) and vitamin D concentration. MSRV DNA copy
number were significantly higher in RRMS patients than healthy controls
(P < 0.0001). Interestingly, an inverse correlation was found between MSRV DNA
copy number and serum vitamin D concentration (P < 0.01), but not for EBV load or
anti-EBNA-1 IgG antibody.
