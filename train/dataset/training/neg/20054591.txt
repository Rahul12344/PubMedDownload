Since the spring of 2009, there have been a considerable number of infected as
well as fatal cases by virologically confirmed swine-origin H1N1 influenza A
virus (S-OIV). The virus continues to spread globally. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has now raised the level of S-OIV influenza pandemic alert to 
phase 6 ('the pandemic phase') because of the human-to-human transmission of the 
virus and the community-level outbreaks worldwide. The WHO also issues its
concerns about the global surveillance, the diagnostic capacity for the infection
and the pandemic preparedness plan in every country. However, no critical review 
on S-OIV influenza and dental practice published in the literature exists
hitherto. Based on information up to November 2009, the aim of this article was
to summarise significant data on this novel virus and a clinical practice
guideline for dental professionals.
