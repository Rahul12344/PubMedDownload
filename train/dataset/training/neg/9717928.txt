PIP: Outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by
Dobrava hantavirus (DOB) have been reported in Albania, Greece, and
Bosnia-Herzegovina. A seroepidemiologic study conducted by the authors in Estonia
provided the first evidence of human DOB infection in a Baltic country.
Hantavirus infection was first confirmed in Estonia in 1986 and believed related 
to Puumala hantavirus (PUU). To enable precise serotyping, serum samples were
collected from 1728 healthy people in 11 counties in Estonia. Of 51 samples
confirmed as positive, 34 showed the highest reactivities to PUU, while 17
reacted best with DOB antigen. In a further analysis of 11 selected positive
samples, six showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies specific to PUU and
five reacted specifically with DOB. These findings suggest that both BOB and PUU 
cause human infections in Estonia.
