Bufavirus (BuV) was first discovered from feces of children with acute diarrhea. 
It was subsequently detected from several animal species including shrews, bats, 
and nonhuman primates. In this study, we identified a novel Protoparvovirus,
designated RatBuV, from the intestinal contents of wild rats using viral
metagenomics. The near complete genome was 4643 nt encoding NS1, VP1, and VP2
proteins. Phylogenetic analysis over the complete genome showed that RatBuV
clustered with Mpulungu BuV from shrews. Sequence analysis indicated that the
putative protein sequences of NS1, VP1, and VP2 of RatBuV shared identities of
50.6-77.2, 48.3-77.3, and 47.1-78.3 %, respectively, with those of human BuVs,
MpBuV, and WUHARV parvovirus, suggesting RatBuV belongs to a new species of
Protoparvovirus. Our epidemiologic study indicated that the prevalence rate of
RatBuV in the cohort of 40 wild rats is 12.5 % (5/40), which is higher than that 
of BuV in humans in a previous study.
