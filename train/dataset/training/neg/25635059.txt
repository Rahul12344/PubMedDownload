Several groups have reported the results of clinical trials of gene augmentation 
therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) because of mutations in the RPE65
gene. These studies have used subretinal injection of adeno-associated virus
(AAV) vectors to deliver the human RPE65 cDNA to the retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) cells of the treated eyes. In all of the studies reported to date, this
approach has been shown to be both safe and effective. The successful clinical
trials of gene augmentation therapy for retinal degeneration caused by mutations 
in the RPE65 gene sets the stage for broad application of gene therapy to treat
retinal degenerative disorders.
