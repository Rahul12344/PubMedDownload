[AIDS and the oral cavity].

[Article in Chinese]

Hwang KC, Chuang CY.

The oral cavity is the site for a number of diseases associated with an infection
of the human immunodeficiency virus. Often the oral lesions may appear before the
establishment of an AIDS diagnosis; and occasionally, the diagnosis may depend
solely on the oral manifestations. The most commonly reported oral infections are
those caused by Candida albicans and the herpes simplex virus. Hairy leukoplakia,
a newly described lesion, may also be of viral origin. Kaposi's sarcoma is the
most frequently reported oral malignancy in patients with AIDS. Oral squamous
cell carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have also been reported.
