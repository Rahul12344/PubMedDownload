In the classic model of antigen processing and presentation, viral antigens must 
be synthesized within the cytoplasm of infected cells to be processed and
presented to CD8+, MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). We have
examined the utility of a retroviral vector (pNeoNef) expressing the human
immunodeficiency virus type (HIV-1)Lai Nef protein for the development of target 
cells to study HIV-specific CTLs. Autologous Epstein-Barr-transformed B cell
lines (EBV-B cells) transduced with pNeoNef were efficiently lysed by CTL lines
from donors capable of lysing EBV-B cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia
virus (rVV) expressing Nef. Also, the transduced cells were efficient stimulator 
cells for the generation of Nef-specific CTL lines. The CTL lines thus generated 
recognized the same epitopes as CTL lines from the same donor generated by
nonspecific stimulation. The use of similar cell lines transduced with retroviral
vectors expressing HIV proteins may be useful in the study of CTLs in
HIV-infected donors and in the study of the ability of candidate vaccines,
including rVV, to induce HIV-specific CTLs. As antigen-presenting cells, the cell
lines may be useful in the generation of antigen-specific CTL lines.
