We describe a case in which a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive child
presented in severe metabolic acidosis secondary to his candidal sepsis and
T-cell lymphoma, a rare finding in pediatric AIDS. Significantly elevated levels 
of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) were found in the patient's serum, which may have
played a role in acute demise.
