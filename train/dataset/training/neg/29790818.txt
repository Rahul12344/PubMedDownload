The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)
protein family is of vital importance for organelle communication. The complexing
of cognate SNARE members present in both the donor and target organellar
membranes drives the membrane fusion required for intracellular transport. In the
endocytic route, SNARE proteins mediate trafficking between endosomes and
phagosomes with other endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, the plasma
membrane, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The goal of this review is to provide an
overview of the SNAREs involved in endosomal and phagosomal trafficking. Of the
38 SNAREs present in humans, 30 have been identified at endosomes and/or
phagosomes. Many of these SNAREs are targeted by viruses and intracellular
pathogens, which thereby reroute intracellular transport for gaining access to
nutrients, preventing their degradation, and avoiding their detection by the
immune system. A fascinating picture is emerging of a complex transport network
with multiple SNAREs being involved in consecutive trafficking routes.
