monoclonal antibody on a Rous sarcoma virus-induced mouse tumor.

Hybrid cell lines were prepared by the fusion of BALB/c myeloma P3U-1 cells with 
the lymphocytes of BALB/c mice that were immunized with syngeneic Rous sarcoma
virus (RSV)-induced tumor CSA1M cells. Three clones of the hybrid progeny (3.4B2,
3.4C6, and 3.5C11) produced cytotoxic IgM antibodies against CSA1M cells. One of 
the clones, 3.5C11, was chosen for analysis of the detailed specificity. Both
direct cytotoxicity assays and absorption tests revealed that monoclonal antibody
from 3.5C11 was positive only with CSA1M cells and that it failed to react with
other tumors, including 20 RSV-induced mouse tumors, and normal cells. The 3.5C11
monoclonal antibody alone, with or without exogenous complement, was suppressive 
in the therapy of ip injected CSA1M tumor in syngeneic hosts, and significant
prolongation in survival was seen in the treated mice. These results clearly
showed presence of an individually distinct tumor-specific cell surface antigen
on an RSV-induced mouse tumor.
