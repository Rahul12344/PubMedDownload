An open reading frame, BamHI D6R, from the central highly conserved region of the
Shope fibroma virus (SFV) genome was sequenced and found to have significant
homology to that of uracil DNA glycosylases from a number of organisms. Uracil
DNA glycosylase catalyzes the initial step in the repair pathway that removes
potentially mutagenic uracil from duplex DNA. The D6R polypeptide was expressed
in reticulocyte lysates programmed with RNA transcribed from an expression vector
containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. A highly specific ethidium bromide
fluorescence assay of the in vitro translation product determined that the
encoded protein does indeed possess uracil DNA glycosylase activity. Open reading
frames from other poxviruses, including vaccinia virus (HindIII D4R) and fowlpox 
(D4), are highly homologous to D6R of SFV and are predicted to encode uracil DNA 
glycosylases. Identification of the SFV uracil DNA glycosylase provides evidence 
that this poxviral protein is involved in the repair of the viral DNA genome.
Since this enzyme performs only the initial step required for the removal of
uracil from DNA, creating an apyrimidinic site, we suggest that other, possibly
virus-encoded, repair activities must be present in the cytoplasm of infected
cells to complete the uracil excision repair pathway.
