HIV-1 infected Molt4-T4 cells provide an efficient system for the production of
cellular precursor gp160 of HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41. The
precursor gp160 was purified on an immuno-affinity column containing antibodies
from sera of HIV-1-seropositive patients. The precursor gp160 was then isolated
by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two out of four Balb/c mice,
immunized with these purified preparations of gp160, developed specific
circulating antibodies. A hybridoma cell line was subsequently isolated producing
monoclonal antibody KL49/19 (IgG1, K) specific for gp160. This monoclonal
antibody can specifically immunoprecipitate gp160, existing in HIV-1-infected
cells. In an immunoblotting assay, it identifies mainly gp160 and shows a slight 
affinity for the mature glycoprotein, gp120. The monoclonal antibody is probably 
directed against an epitope in the polypeptide residue of gp160 since it can
recognize a deglycosylated polypeptide of molecular weight 90,000, a product of
gp160 digestion by endoglycosidase H (Endo H). It does not cross-react with any
protein of HIV-2 by immunoblot or immunoprecipitation assays. By virtue of its
specificity, the monoclonal antibody KL49/19 might provide a powerful probe with 
which to detect gp160 in cells which might partially express the HIV-1 genes.
