Most neural cells constitutively lack major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I and beta 2-microglobulin gene expression. Cytokines and viruses may,
however, induce expression of these genes in some neural cells, and this
correlates with factor binding to the NF-kappa B and interferon stimulated
response elements of these genes. Here, we demonstrate that NF-kappa B is capable
of inducing MHC class I and beta 2-microglobulin gene expression when transiently
co-transfected into CHP-126 neuroblastomas, and that IRF-2 represses this
induction. Interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) repression of MHC class I and
beta 2-microglobulin gene expression in CHP-126 neuroblastomas may demonstrate a 
mechanism by which virus persists in neural cells. We show here that IRF-2
physically interacts in vitro with NF-kappa B. This interaction may contribute to
the repression of the expression of these genes. Our demonstration that IRF
family members, in addition to IRF-2, physically interact in vitro with NF-kappa 
B (p50 and p65), provides a general mechanism by which these transcription
factors may, in concert, regulate the expression of a variety of genes involved
in immune responses in the brain.
