Viruses are ubiquitous parasites of cellular life forms and the most abundant
biological entities on earth. The relationships between viruses and their hosts
involve the continuous arms race but are by no account limited to it. Growing
evidence shows that, in the course of evolution, viruses and their components are
repeatedly recruited (exapted) for host functions. The functions of exapted
viruses typically involve either defense from other viruses or cellular
competitors or transfer of nucleic acids between cells, or storage functions.
Virus exaptation can reach different depths, from recruitment of a fully
functional virus to exploitation of defective, partially degraded viruses, to
utilization of individual virus proteins.
