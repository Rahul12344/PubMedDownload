The RNA genome of Plum pox virus (PPV) encodes one large polyprotein that is
subsequently cleaved into mature viral proteins. One of the products of
proteolytic processing, the 6K1 protein, has not yet been identified in vivo for 
any member of the genus Potyvirus. In this study, 6K1-specific polyclonal
antiserum was raised against PPV 6K1 expressed in Escherichia coli as a
translational fusion with the N terminus of avian troponin C and an unusual
metal-binding cluster of troponin T-1. For detection of 6K1 in vivo, a
pPPV-H6K1-NAT infectious clone was constructed, enabling concentration of
histidine-tagged 6K1 by affinity chromatography. Affinity-purified 6K1 was
detected in locally infected Nicotiana benthamiana leaves at 4, 7 and 14 days
post-inoculation (d.p.i.) and, in addition, in systemically infected leaves at 14
d.p.i., 6K1 was detected exclusively as a protein of 6 kDa and no polyprotein
precursors were identified with the raised anti-6K1 antiserum.
