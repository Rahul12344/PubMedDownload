Given the shared risk factors for transmission, co-infection of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
quite common, and may lead to increases in morbidity and mortality. As such, HBV 
vaccine is recommended as the primary means to prevent HBV super-infection in
HCV- and/or HIV-infected individuals. However, vaccine response (sero-conversion 
with a hepatitis B surface antibody titer >10 IU/L) in this setting is often
blunted, with poor response rates to standard HBV vaccinations in virally
infected individuals when compared with the healthy subjects. This phenomenon
also occurs to other vaccines in adults, such as pneumococcal and influenza
vaccines, in other immunocompromised hosts who are really at risk for
opportunistic infections, such as individuals with hemodialysis, transplant, and 
malignancy. In this review, we summarize the underlying mechanisms involving
vaccine failure in these conditions, focusing on immune exhaustion and immune
senescence--two distinct signaling pathways regulating cell function and fate. We
raise the possibility that blocking these negative signaling pathways might
improve success rates of immunizations in the setting of chronic viral infection.
