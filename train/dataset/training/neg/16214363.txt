In the central nervous system, neural stem cells proliferate in the ventricular
zone (VZ) and sequentially give rise to both neurons and glial cells in a
temporally and spatially regulated manner, suggesting that stem cells may differ 
from one another in different brain regions and at different developmental
stages. For the purpose of marking and purifying neural stem cells to ascertain
whether such differences exist, we generated transgenic mice using promoters from
Hes genes (pHes1 or pHes5) to drive expression of destabilized enhanced green
fluorescent protein. In the developing brains of these transgenic mice, GFP
expression was restricted to undifferentiated cells in the VZ, which could
asymmetrically produce a Numb-positive neuronal daughter and a GFP-positive
progenitor cell in clonal culture, indicating that they retain the capacity to
self-renew. Our results suggest that pHes-EGFP transgenic mice can be used to
explore similarities and differences among neural stem cells during development.
