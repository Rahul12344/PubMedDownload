MHC antigens are positioned in the centre of the interactions between enterocytes
and lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. This disease is
associated with the presence of specific alleles of MHC-class II genes.
Class-II-gene products being present also on enterocytic membranes play an
important role in the presentation of antigens and might lead in coeliac patients
to an extraordinarily effective stimulation of CD4+ and/or CD8+ cells which
induce damage to the intestinal epithelium by various mechanisms. Additionally
so-called CD4-CD8-gamma/delta + lymphocytes might act cytotoxically on
enterocytes. The typical HLA-haplotype, however, is found also in many healthy
persons. Thus the presence of specific MHC molecules is not the only requirement 
for susceptibility to gliadins. Furthermore, a virus infection (cross reactivity 
with gliadins?) as an additional factor can not be considered to be sufficient
for expression of coeliac disease. Results were presented demonstrating that
gliadins affect undifferentiated enterocytes arguing for a role of additional
enterocytic factors in the pathogenesis of the disorder. The findings suggest
that gliadins interfere with late post-translational processes in the
biosynthesis of sucrase-isomaltase. The integration of this effect into the
pathogenetic mechanism of coeliac disease remains to be clarified.
