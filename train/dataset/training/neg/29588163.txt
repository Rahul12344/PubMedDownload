Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique dendritic cell subset that are
specialized in type I interferon (IFN) production. pDCs are key players in the
antiviral immune response and serve as bridge between innate and adaptive
immunity. Although pDCs do not represent the main reservoir of the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), they are a crucial subset in HIV infection as they 
influence viral transmission, target cell infection and antigen presentation.
pDCs act as inflammatory and immunosuppressive cells, thus contributing to HIV
disease progression. This review provides a state of art analysis of the
interactions between HIV and pDCs and their potential roles in HIV transmission, 
chronic immune activation and immunosuppression. A thorough understanding of the 
roles of pDCs in HIV infection will help to improve therapeutic strategies to
fight HIV infection, and will further increase our knowledge on this important
immune cell subset.
