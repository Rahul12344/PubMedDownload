Inflammatory reactions to ssRNA viruses are induced by the endosomal Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8. TLR7/8-mediated inflammatory reaction results in
activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome via an unknown mechanism. Here we report for
the first time that TLR7/8 mediate activation of xanthine oxidase (XOD) in an
HIF-1α-dependent manner. XOD produces uric acid and reactive oxygen species,
which could activate Nalp3 and therefore induce activation of caspase 1, known to
convert inactive pro-IL-1β into active IL-1β. Specific inhibition of the XOD
activity attenuates TLR7/8-mediated activation of caspase 1 and IL-1β release.
These results were obtained using human THP-1 myeloid macrophages. The findings
were verified by conducting in vivo experiments on mice.
