The enigmatic methyltransferase, DNMT2 (DNA methyltransferase 2), structurally
resembles a DNA methyltransferase, but has been shown to be a tRNA
methyltransferase targeting cytosine within a specific CpG in different tRNA
molecules. We had previously shown that, during environmental stress conditions, 
DNMT2 is re-localized from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs)
and is associated with RNA-processing proteins. In the present study, we show
that DNMT2 binds and methylates various mRNA species in a sequence-independent
manner and gets re-localized to SGs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.
Importantly, our results indicate that HIV-1 enhances its survivability in the
host cell by utilizing this RNA methylation capability of DNMT2 to increase the
stability of its own genome. Upon infection, DNMT2 re-localizes from the nucleus 
to the SGs and methylates HIV-1 RNA. This DNMT2-dependent methylation provided
post-transcriptional stability to the HIV-1 RNA. Furthermore, DNMT2
overexpression increased the HIV-1 viral titre. This would suggest that HIV
hijacks the RNA-processing machinery within the SGs to ensure its own survival in
the host cell. Thus, our findings provide for a novel mechanism by which virus
tries to modulate the host cell machinery to its own advantage.
