BACKGROUND: Trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS) is a rare skin affection seen in
immunocompromised patients, mainly those with solid organ tranplants.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a patient with classic clinical and pathologic
findings for the disease so that physicians caring for this population are aware 
of the clinical presentation.
METHOD: We report the case of a female patient we saw at our clinic with a
diagnosis of TS.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of TS was confirmed by pathologic findings.
CONCLUSION: TS should be considered in any immunocompromised patient with a
papular facial eruption reminiscent of acne vulgaris and with keratotic spiny
papules as a distinctive feature.
