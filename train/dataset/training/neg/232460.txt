Effect of vitamin A on plasminogen activator synthesis by chick embryo
fibroblasts.

Wilson EL, Reich E.

Low concentrations of Vitamin A stimulated plasminogen activator synthesis (PA)
in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF). It caused a dose dependent and reversible
increase in PA synthesis in both normal CEF and CEF infected with a temperature
sensitive mutant of Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV-Ts68). Both induction and deinduction
of PA could be inhibited by Actinomycin D. Vitamin A also accentuated the
morphological changes associated with transformation in the Rous Sarcoma virus
infected cells. The effects of Vitamin A on PA synthesis were essentially similar
to those of the known tumour promoter, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Both
Vitamin A and PMA were found to act synergistically with sarcoma gene expression 
as far as PA synthesis was concerned.
