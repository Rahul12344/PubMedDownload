RNAs from 13 strains of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) were divided into two groups 
on the basis of their ability to hybridize to cDNA of either Fny-CMV RNA or
WL-CMV RNA. The extent of the cross-hybridization within one of these groups was 
analyzed by an RNA protection assay. A cDNA clone of RNA 3 of the Fny strain of
CMV was placed in a transcription vector between bacterial promoters T3 and T7.
Labeled, minus-sense RNA transcripts prepared from all or part of the cDNA to RNA
3 of Fny-CMV were annealed to the genomic RNA of each of a number of
cucumoviruses and digested with RNases. The patterns of RNA fragments protected
from digestion were specific for each CMV strain and revealed the extent and
location of heterogeneity among the viruses as well as within the Fny-CMV natural
population. This approach will allow the differences in host range and disease
processes to be correlated with variations in genomic RNAs.
