RNA polymerase II encounters an elongation block and stalls in vivo during
transcription of the late strand of polyomavirus DNA. In this study, we performed
transcriptional run-on assays and localized the stalling site to a 164-nucleotide
region (nt 11-175) that contains specific binding sites for polyomavirus large T 
antigen. The effect of large T antigen on elongation by RNA polymerase II through
this region was examined in cells infected with a mutant polyomavirus (AT3-ts25E)
which encodes a thermolabile large T antigen. Removal of functional large T
antigen by shifting to the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees) eliminated
stalling by RNA polymerase in this region, although RNA polymerases transcribing 
other regions of the viral genome were unaffected. RNA polymerase resumed
stalling when functional large T antigen was again allowed to accumulate by
shifting back to the permissive temperature (32 degrees). We conclude that
stalling by RNA polymerase II in vivo is dependent on the presence of functional 
large T antigen.
