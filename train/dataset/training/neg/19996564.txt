Flavivirus-infected sera are known to show cross-reactions in serodiagnoses of
heterologous flavivirus infections. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic 
in Asia and, in Japan, many horses are vaccinated against JEV. However, the
cross-reactivity level of JEV-vaccinated horse sera in the serodiagnosis of West 
Nile virus (WNV) has not been clarified. The antibody cross-reactivity of
JEV-vaccinated horse sera in WNV serological tests, such as the plaque reduction 
neutralization test (PRNT), IgG indirect ELISA (IgG-ELISA) and hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) test, was examined. All JEV-vaccinated horse sera were positive
for JEV antibodies with JEV PRNT at both 90% and 50% plaque reductions. In WNV
PRNT, 16.7% of the horses were positive at 90% plaque reduction, and 50% of the
horses were positive at 50% plaque reduction. All the JEV-vaccinated horse sera
showed positive-to-negative (P/N) ratios of over 2.0 with JEV IgG-ELISA, and half
of them had P/N ratios of over 2.0 with WNV IgG-ELISA. There was little
difference between the JEV HI and WNV HI titers in individual horses. These
results indicate that in serosurveillance of WNV, JEV-vaccinated horses can
produce false-positive results in WNV IgG-ELISA, HI and PRNT.
