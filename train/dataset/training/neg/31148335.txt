OBJECTIVES: The clinical significance of low-level viraemia (LLV) during
antiretroviral therapy (ART) is debated. We retrospectively investigated
longitudinal levels of plasma markers associated with inflammation, altered
coagulation and cardiovascular disease in Swedish HIV-positive adults in relation
to LLV or permanent virological suppression during long-term ART.
METHODS: Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2), growth
differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163 (sCD163),
interferon-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and β-2-microglobulin were measured in 34
individuals with LLV (viral load 50-999 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) and in matched
controls with persistent virological suppression. Biomarker levels were analysed 
in samples obtained during episodes of LLV and follow-up samples obtained 1 year 
later (with similar timing for controls). All biomarkers were analysed using an
independent sample t-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after logarithmic
transformation. Log-rank analysis was applied for markers with concentration
values out of range.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with LLV had significantly higher
levels of GDF-15 [geometric mean 3416 (95% confidence interval (CI) 804-14 516)
pg/mL versus 2002 (95% CI 355-11 295) pg/mL in controls; P = 0.026] and D-dimer
[mean 1114 (95% CI 125-9917) ng/mL versus 756 (95% CI 157-3626) ng/mL; P = 0.038]
after adjustment for age, CD4 count nadir and type of ART. In the unadjusted
t-test, only GDF-15 was significantly higher and in the log-rank test, both
GDF-15 and D-dimer were significantly elevated. No significant differences were
observed for the other biomarkers analysed.
CONCLUSIONS: Although levels of inflammation markers were similar in ART
recipients with and without LLV, persons with LLV had significantly higher levels
of GDF-15 and D-dimer. These findings suggest a potential link between LLV and
cardiovascular outcomes.
