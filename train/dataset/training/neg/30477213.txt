The use of mycoviruses to manipulate the virulence of entomopathogenic fungi
employed as biocontrol agents may lead to the development of novel methods to
control attacks by insect pests. Such approaches are urgently required, as
existing agrochemicals are being withdrawn from the market due to environmental
and health concerns. The aim of this work is to investigate the presence and
diversity of mycoviruses in large panels of entomopathogenic fungi, mostly from
Spain and Denmark. In total, 151 isolates belonging to the genera Beauveria,
Metarhizium, Lecanicillium, Purpureocillium, Isaria, and Paecilomyces were
screened for the presence of dsRNA elements and 12 Spanish B. bassiana isolates
were found to harbor mycoviruses. All identified mycoviruses belong to three
previously characterised species, the officially recognised Beauveria bassiana
victorivirus 1 (BbVV-1) and the proposed Beauveria bassiana partitivirus 2
(BbPV-2) and Beauveria bassiana polymycovirus 1 (BbPmV-1); individual B. bassiana
isolates may harbor up to three of these mycoviruses. Notably, these mycovirus
species are under distinct selection pressures, while recombination of viral
genomes increases population diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene sequences revealed that the current population 
structure in Spain is potentially a result of both vertical and horizontal
mycovirus transmission. Finally, pathogenicity experiments using the
Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata showed no direct correlation between
the presence of any particular mycovirus and the virulence of the B. bassiana
isolates, but illustrated potentially interesting isolates that exhibit
relatively high virulence, which will be used in more detailed virulence
experimentation in the future.
