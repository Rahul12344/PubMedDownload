Priming of naive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by dendritic cells (DCs) requires
effective antigen presentation on both MHC class I and II molecules. We have
developed a novel technology to use recombinant overlapping peptides (ROP) that
stimulate both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell immune responses. The single chain protein of
a ROP is made up of overlapping peptides linked by the target sequence (LRMK) for
cathepsin S, a protease found in the endosomes of DCs. We designed synthetic
genes encoding ROPs derived from ovalbumin (OVA), tuberculosis protein
(CFP10-ESAT6), human papilloma virus (HPV) protein (E7) and survivin, a protein
commonly over-expressed in tumour cells. An epitope from ROP-OVA was
cross-presented and detected by a CD8+ T cell receptor-like antibody (TCR like
Ab). Human DCs pulsed with ROP-survivin activated CD8+ T cells. CD4-low PBMCs
from HIV and TB co-infected patients recognized ROP-CFP10-ESAT6 compared to a
soluble form of the antigen. Immunization of mice with ROP-survivin or ROP-HPV-E7
generated specific cellular immune responses and protected mice from inoculation 
with melanoma B16 cells expressing survivin or HPV-E7 proteins. Together these
data provide evidence to support ROP as a central component of a new platform for
therapeutic vaccines and diagnostics.
