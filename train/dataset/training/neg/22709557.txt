In 2010, a chimpanzee died at Copenhagen Zoo following an outbreak of respiratory
disease among chimpanzees in the zoo. Identification of coxsackie B3 virus, a
common human pathogen, as the causative agent, and its severe manifestation,
raise questions about pathogenicity and transmissibility among humans and other
primates.
