Sequence analysis of HPV16 isolates reveals the presence of genome variants with 
characteristic mutations. The HPV16 variants have different geographical
distribution and diverge into four phylogenetic lineages (A, B, C and D) and 16
sub-lineages: A1, A2, A3 (previously known as European variants), A4 (Asian
variant), B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, and C4 (African variants), D1
(North-American variant), D2, D3 (Asian-American variants) and D4. Population
studies showed that infections with viruses belonging to specific HPV16
sublineages confer different risks of viral persistence and cancer. In this
study, 39 HPV16-positive cervical smears from European women living in Calabria
(Italy) were analyzed for the presence of HPV16 variants. Cervical DNA extracts
were processed by PCR to amplify L1, the Long Control Region (LCR), E6 and E7,
which were sequenced. The sequences were concatenated and the 3169 nucleotides
long fragments were characterized by BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 
96 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) were detected, 29 of which mapping in
the L1, 45 in the LCR, 15 in the E6 and 7 in the E7. The most common SNP was the 
T350G (29/39 samples, 74.4%), causing the L83 V amino acid change in the E6. Most
of the HPV16 isolates (89.7%) had 99% of nucleotide (nt) identity to members of
the A1 and A2 sublineages, while 4 isolates had 99% nt identity to members of the
B2, B4, C1 and D4 sublineages. In conclusion, viruses belonging to the A1, A2,
B2, B4, C1 and D4 HPV16 sublineages were found to circulate in the Calabria
region.
