The evaluation of long-term cellular immunity to EBV in pediatric orthotopic
liver transplant (OLT) recipients after treatment with the humanized anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody (Rituximab) has not yet been explored. At our institution,
one child with EBV-related mononucleosis-like syndrome and five children with
polymorphic-EBV-PTLD occurring 6-88 months after OLT were treated with Rituximab.
Treatment was well tolerated. All children achieved complete remission. After
Rituximab, B-lymphocytes were undetectable in the peripheral blood and EBV-load, 
monitored with real-time PCR, decreased to undetectable levels in all children
from >4000 copies/microg DNA at diagnosis. Four to eight months after Rituximab, 
EBV-load increased (>4000 copies/microg DNA) in four children, and PTLD recurred 
in three. Their frequency of EBV-specific T-cell precursors, measured by Elispot 
analysis, remained lower than in healthy controls. Rituximab effectively induced 
regression of PTLD in OLT recipients. However, EBV-specific T-cell
immunocompetence, which may be crucial for the long-term control of EBV-mediated 
proliferation, did not improve.
