Restricting linear peptides to their bioactive conformation is an attractive way 
of improving their stability and activity. We used a cyclic peptide library with 
conformational diversity for selecting an active and stable peptide that mimics
the structure and activity of the HIV-1 integrase (IN) binding loop from its
cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75 (residues 361-370). All peptides in the library had
the same primary sequence, and differed only in their conformation. Library
screening revealed that the ring size and linker structure had a huge effect on
the conformation, binding and activity of the peptides. One of the cyclic
peptides, c(MZ 4-1), was a potent and stable inhibitor of IN activity in vitro
and in cells even after 8 days. The NMR structure of c(MZ 4-1) showed that it
obtains a bioactive conformation that is similar to the parent site in LEDGF/p75.
