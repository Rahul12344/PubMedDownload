We studied the impact of influenza vaccine during an outbreak of influenza at a
989-student boarding school in January to March, 1989. By February 6, 120 (17%)
of 690 students completing survey questionnaires had been ill with fever and
respiratory symptoms. Eighty-seven students had received influenza vaccine in the
previous 18 months; these students had an attack rate half that of the
unvaccinated students (9% v 19%; vaccine efficacy = 50%, confidence interval =
0%-70%). We estimate that, if the entire student body had been vaccinated,
influenza-like illness could have been prevented in 162 students (16% of the
school), and that preventing this illness could have avoided at least 482
student-days of missed classes, or approximately one student-day for each 1.8
additional doses of vaccine given. This study suggests that, when feasible, a
broad influenza immunization policy for healthy students at residential schools
should substantially decrease the disruption of school activities caused by
influenza.
