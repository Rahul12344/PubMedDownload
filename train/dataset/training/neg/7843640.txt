Four different virus-inactivated factor VIII concentrates (Haemate P, Behring;
Profilate, Alpha, FVIII-VHP-vWF, CRTS), near-pure von Willebrand factor (Facteur 
Willebrand, CRTS) or one recombinant FVIII preparation (Recombinate, Baxter) were
given to one or more patients with different forms of von Willebrand's disease.
Duke bleeding time, VIII:C, vWF:Ag, RC of activity, and the multimeric pattern of
plasma vWF were monitored. Both Duke bleeding time and the multimeric pattern
were normalized after treatment with Haemate P, FVIII-VHP-vWF, or Facteur
Willebrand, and to a lesser extent after Profilate. Except in one case, the
reduction in bleeding time lasted longer after Haemate P than after the other
concentrates. Recombinate had no effect on primary hemostasis, and the half-life 
of VIII:C was very short. If prompt hemostasis is required, and when
pharmacological correction of the defect is impossible, we recommend a
concentrate containing both FVIII and the full complement of vWF multimers, but
for prophylactic treatment pure von Willebrand factor may be used.
