OBJECTIVE: To clarify the distribution of hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype in
geographical regions of China.
METHODS: Seventeen representative HAV strains were isolated from the stool or
serum of hepatitis A patients in different geographical regions. Viral RNA was
recovered from stool or serum by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform
extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation prior to reverse transcription and 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. The nucleotide sequences of
VP1/2A junction region were tested by using a direct sequencing technique.
RESULTS: A pairwise comparison of sequences within 168 bases at the VP1/2A
junction revealed that all the sequences clustered within genotype I. About 53%
of strains clustered in genotype I B, with less than 6% variability; while the
others clustered in genotype I A, with less than 5.3% variability. Sequence
homology between genotype I A and I B varied from 88.7% to 92.3%.
CONCLUSION: Epidemic or sporadic HAV strains in China may belong to HAV genotype 
I A or I B. Epidemiologically related strains may be identical or closely related
in sequence.
