OBJECTIVE: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gamma-herpesvirus 
implicated in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and 
some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease. The KSHV open reading frame (ORF)
36 encodes a viral serine/threonine protein kinase. The aim of this study was to 
characterize the cellular function of the ORF36 protein.
METHODS: The expression kinetics of the ORF36 protein and its localization were
determined. The wild-type ORF36 and its mutant proteins were subjected to in
vitro kinase assay. Cell morphology change by ORF36 protein was studied. The
focal adhesion kinase (FAK) tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage were determined
when ORF36 was expressed.
RESULTS: ORF36 protein expressed in the late phase during the KSHV reactivation. 
The C-terminal domain of ORF36 protein was important for kinase activity.
Moreover, the ORF36 protein altered cell morphology to a round shape, similar to 
the phenotype of FAK-deficient cells. The kinase activity of ORF36 protein was
required for the inhibition of cell spreading. Interestingly, ORF36 protein
colocalized with FAK, suppressed its tyrosine phosphorylation and promoted FAK
cleavage.
CONCLUSION: Our results collectively demonstrate that the KSHV ORF36 protein is a
viral protein kinase that inhibits cell spreading and FAK activation.
