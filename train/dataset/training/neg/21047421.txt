Epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that chronic
inflammation induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is crucial in hepatocellular
carcinogenesis. The interaction between hepatocytes and microenvironment regards 
virus, inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, chemo- and cyto-kines, reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), generating cell transformation. We
suggest hepatocarcinoma (HCC) as a model in which the targeting of
microenvironment determine neoplastic transformation. The present review focuses 
on: the role of inflammation in carcinogenesis, the clinical impact of HCC and
the inadequacy of the actual therapy, the chemoprevention targeting the
microenvironment.
