Between 2000 and 2004, dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) genotypes I and II from Asia 
were introduced into the Pacific region and co-circulated in some localities.
Envelope protein gene sequences of DENV-1 from 12 patients infected on the island
of New Caledonia were obtained, five of which carried genotype I viruses and six,
genotype II viruses. One patient harboured a mixed infection, containing viruses 
assigned to both genotypes I and II, as well as a number of inter-genotypic
recombinants. This is the first report of a population of dengue viruses isolated
from a patient containing both parental and recombinant viruses.
