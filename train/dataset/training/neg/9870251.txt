The post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders represent a significant
clinical and diagnostic problem. However, these disorders also represent an
important biological model for studying the development and progression of
lymphoid neoplasia in immune deficiency. Accurate diagnosis and classification of
these disorders requires correlative multiparametric analysis of the clinical
behavior of the patient with the histopathological features, immunophenotype,
clonal composition, and genetic alterations of the lymphoproliferative disorder. 
Such analyses should also assist in furthering our understanding of the
pathogenesis of these disorders.
