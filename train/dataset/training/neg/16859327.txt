The Royal Society of London held a scientific meeting in September 2000 focusing 
on two theories of the origin of AIDS: one, that it occurred through "natural
transfer" of immunodeficiency virus from monkeys or chimpanzees to humans; and
the other, that it occurred through iatrogenic transfer via contaminated polio
vaccines used in Africa in the late 1950s. This meeting was the culmination of
years of public contention over the polio-vaccine theory. Several dimensions of
the politics of science are revealed by analysis of this issue, including the
power of scientific editors, the use of the mass media, decisions regarding
selection of speakers and organization of the meeting, and epistemological
assumptions made by participants.
