Using the Maedi-Visna virus strain WLC1 (Weybridge) and different cell lines of
sheep plexus chorioideus we were able to establish and improve a production
procedure of MV-antigen for use in immunodiffusion assay. Our attention was
focused mainly on the efficient virus multiplication in cell cultures and on
standardisation of the procedure to find a method keeping the antigen loss as low
as possible. Investigations with our antigen in 39 farms of 5 of the former
districts in East Germany revealed a seropositive reagent rate between 0 and more
than 60%, underlining the need for a complex diagnostic and eradication
programme.
