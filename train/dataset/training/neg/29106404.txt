Gene therapy may offer a new treatment option, particularly for patients with
severe hemophilia, based on recent research. However, individuals with
pre-existing immunity to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) may be less likely to
benefit from AAV vector-based therapies. To study pre-existing AAV5 immunity in
humans, we validated two complementary, sensitive, and scalable in vitro assays
to detect AAV5 total antibodies and transduction inhibition (TI). Using these two
assays, we found that 53% of samples from 100 healthy male individuals were
negative in both assays, 18% were positive in both assays, 5% were positive for
total antibodies but negative for TI and, of interest, 24% were negative for
total antibodies but positive for TI activity, suggesting the presence of
non-antibody-based neutralizing factors in human plasma. Similar findings were
obtained with 24 samples from individuals with hemophilia A. On the basis of
these results, we describe the development of a dual-assay strategy to identify
individuals without total AAV5 antibodies or neutralizing factors who may be more
likely to respond to AAV5-directed gene therapy. These assays offer a universal, 
transferrable platform across laboratories to assess the global prevalence of
AAV5 antibodies and neutralizing factors in large patient populations to help
inform clinical development strategies.
