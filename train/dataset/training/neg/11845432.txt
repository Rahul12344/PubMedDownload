The adherence of bacteria to eukaryote cells has been largely investigated as an 
essential step in the occurrence of bacterial infection. Some clinical and
epidemiological studies have revealed the frequent association of certain viral
infections with bacterial infections originating in the same ecological niche.
Therefore, we investigated the effect of the viral preinfection (ADV4) of some
cultivated cells (HEp-2 and IC.SK-27) upon the adherence of staphylococcus to
these cells. The analysis of cell adherence within the mentioned conditions,
estimated by flow cytometry, allowed of the following conclusions: 1. bacterial
adherence to cultivated and virally preinfected cells is augmented by the viral
preinfection, and its value on a given cell substrate may characterize a
bacterial strain; 2. bacterial adherence to the investigated cell substrates does
not correlate with the origin of the tested staphylococcus strains (infections or
carriers) and some cell lines can differentiate bacterial strains depending upon 
the ecological niche or inside it.
