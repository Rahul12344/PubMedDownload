We report a 48-year-old Japanese man suffering from xeroderma pigmentosum
associated with mental retardation, cerebral atrophy and cerebellar ataxia.
Cultured fibroblasts from an unexposed area of skin had reduced DNA repair
capacity after UV irradiation, with higher sensitivity to UV than normal cells in
colony-forming ability and host cell reactivation using herpes simplex virus.
Genetic complementation tests by cell fusion with polyethylene glycol revealed
that the patient belonged to group F. He died of bile duct cancer at the age of
50. This is the first report of an XP-F patient with neurological abnormalities.
