OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection in men attending a sexually transmitted diseases
(STD) clinic in Hangzhou area.
METHODS: Male subjects (n=375) aged 18-70 years, attending the STD clinic were
recruited. Urethral swabs were assessed for HPV DNA using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) with the consensus primers MY09/11. HPV genotypes of positive PCR 
products were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms and direct 
sequence analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 375 swabs collected, 305 (81.3%) yielded sufficient DNA for the
subsequent HPV analysis. Among the 305 subjects, the prevalence of HPV was 13.8%.
Nononcogenic HPV types were found in 8.5% (26/305) of subjects, oncogenic types
in 4.3% (13/305), and multiple types in 1.0% (3/305). The prevalence of HPV
infection was higher in subjects from urban area than in those from rural area (P
< 0.05). The prevalence was also higher in those who received fewer years of
education (P < 0.05) and those who had more sex partners (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection among men at high risk is not uncommon. The detection 
rate of HPV DNA is significantly related to some sociodemographic factors, such
as residence, educational level and the number of sex partners.
