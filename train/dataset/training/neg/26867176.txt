Avian influenza virus reassortants resembling the 1918 human pandemic virus can
become transmissible among mammals by acquiring mutations in hemagglutinin (HA)
and polymerase. Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by
which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and
airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity
increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations
that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions,
selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a
"loose" bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations
emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host
bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred
in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian
transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic 
constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in 
mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic
viruses.
