Atypical forms of molluscum contagiosum may be challenging to diagnose and are
found in immunocompromised patients where they indicate severe impairment of
cellular immunity. We report a case of disseminated atypical molluscum
contagiosum which was the first sign of HIV infection and AIDS disease in a
38-year-old male patient. The lesions - painless, flesh-colored and violaceous
papules and nodules - spread systematically for previous 3 years. They were
located on the face, forearms, in the groins and in the genital region. Serologic
tests for HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus were positive. CD4+ T-cells count was
80/mm(3). The skin biopsy showed intracytoplasmic molluscum bodies. Atypical,
recalcitrant, disseminated or facial molluscum contagiosum requires immediate HIV
testing. In our patient, both the opportunity for early diagnosis and the
institution of effective therapy were missed.
