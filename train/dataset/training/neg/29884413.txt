OBJECTIVES: We report 2-year results from CheckMate 141 to establish the
long-term efficacy and safety profile of nivolumab and outcomes by tumor PD-L1
expression in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M),platinum-refractory
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN with tumor progression/recurrence within
6 months of platinum therapy were randomized 2:1 to nivolumab 3 mg/kg every
2 weeks or investigator's choice (IC). Primary endpoint: overall survival (OS).
Data cutoff: September 2017.
RESULTS: With 24.2 months' minimum follow-up, nivolumab (n = 240) continued to
improve OS vs IC (n = 121), hazard ratio (HR) = 0.68 (95% CI 0.54-0.86).
Nivolumab nearly tripled the estimated 24-month OS rate (16.9%) vs IC (6.0%), and
demonstrated OS benefit across patients with tumor PD-L1 expression ≥1% (HR [95% 
CI] = 0.55 [0.39-0.78]) and  < 1% (HR [95% CI] = 0.73 [0.49-1.09]), and
regardless of tumor HPV status. Estimated OS rates at 18, 24, and 30 months with 
nivolumab were consistent irrespective of PD-L1 expression (<1%/≥1%). In the
nivolumab arm, there were no observed differences in baseline characteristics or 
safety profile between long-term survivors and the overall population. Grade 3-4 
treatment-related adverse event rates were 15.3% and 36.9% for nivolumab and IC, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Nivolumab significantly improved OS at the primary analysis and
demonstrated prolonged OS benefit vs IC and maintenance of a manageable and
consistent safety profile with 2-year follow-up. OS benefit was observed with
nivolumab irrespective of PD-L1 expression and HPV status. (Clinicaltrials.gov:
NCT02105636).
