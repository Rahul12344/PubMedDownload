Shorebirds are a primary reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIV). We conducted
surveillance studies in Iceland shorebird populations for 3 years, documenting
high serological evidence of AIV exposure in shorebirds, primarily in Ruddy
Turnstones (Arenaria interpres; seroprevalence=75%). However, little evidence of 
virus infection was found in these shorebird populations and only two turnstone
AIVs (H2N7; H5N1) were able to be phylogenetically examined. These analyses
showed that viruses from Iceland shorebirds were primarily derived from Eurasian 
lineage viruses, yet the H2 hemagglutinin gene segment was from a North American 
lineage previously detected in a gull from Iceland the previous year. The H5N1
virus was determined to be low pathogenic, however the PB2 gene was closely
related to the PB2 from highly pathogenic H5N1 isolates from China. Multiple
lines of evidence suggest that the turnstones were infected with at least one of 
these AIV while in Iceland and confirm Iceland as an important location where AIV
from different continents interact and reassort, creating new virus genomes.
Mounting data warrant continued surveillance for AIV in wild birds in the North
Atlantic, including Canada, Greenland, and the northeast USA to determine the
risks of new AI viruses and their intercontinental movement in this region.
