CTLs specific to p53 were previously shown to efficiently eradicate
p53-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro as well as in vivo. In this report, we
demonstrate that these CTLs can also eliminate tumors that display moderate or
even low levels of p53. Neither high steady-state levels of p53 nor elevated p53 
synthesis is a prerequisite for recognition of tumors by p53-specific CTLs.
Instead, our data show that a high p53 turnover rate is an important factor in
determining the sensitivity of tumor cells to p53-specific CTLs. Our data suggest
that p53 turnover is related to the MHC class I-restricted presentation of
p53-derived epitopes at the tumor cell surface and indicate that CTL-mediated
immunotherapy that targets p53 can be applied to a wider range of tumors than has
thus far been anticipated.
