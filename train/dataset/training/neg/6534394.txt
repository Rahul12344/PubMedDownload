In the period from September 1981 to April 1982, one strain of influenza virus
(A-H3N2) was isolated from 121 throat cultures obtained from patients with acute 
febrile respiratory disease. A sero-epidemiological survey on 520 serum samples
and evaluation of excess mortality from respiratory diseases did not show
significant activity of influenza viruses during the period from October 1981 to 
October 1982.
