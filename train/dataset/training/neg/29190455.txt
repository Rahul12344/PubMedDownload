Glossina palipides salivary gland hypertrophy virus (GpSGHV) infects tsetse
flies, which are vectors for African trypanosomosis. This virus represents a
major challenge in insect mass rearing and has hampered the implementation of the
sterile insect technique programs in the Member States of the International
Atomic Energy Agency. GpSGHV virions consist of long rod-shaped particles over
9000Å in length, but little is known about their detailed structural
organization. We show by cryo electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography
that the GpSGHV virion has a unique, non-icosahedral helical structure. Its
envelope exhibits regularly spaced spikes that protrude from the lipid bilayer
and are arranged on a four-start helix. This study provides a detailed insight
into the 3D architecture of GpSGHV, which will help to understand the viral life 
cycle and possibly allow the design of antiviral strategies in the context of
tsetse fly infections.
