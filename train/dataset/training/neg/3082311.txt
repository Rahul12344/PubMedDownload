Molecular hybridization studies with scrapie brain nucleic acids. I. Search for
specific DNA sequences.

Borr√°s T, Gibbs CJ Jr.

Chromatography and hybridization techniques employing scrapie enriched fractions 
of hamster brains were employed to detect a scrapie-specific DNA molecule.
125I-labeled DNA from eight different scrapie-enriched hamster brain fractions
was hybridized to total DNA and RNA from normal and scrapie hamster and mouse and
to DNA from normal human brain and brain tissue from patients dying with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Enrichment for infectivity was obtained by cellular
partition, gel filtration and gel electrophoresis. Reassociation of the probes
with the scrapie DNA did not have a higher value than with the normal. The level 
of detection in these studies indicated that if scrapie were a DNA virus
replicating through DNA its specific infectivity would be lower than 687
molecules per infectious unit. These findings weaken the possibility that scrapie
is a DNA virus.
