Size-fractionated aerosol particles were collected in a hospital emergency
department to test for airborne influenza virus. Using real-time polymerase chain
reaction, we confirmed the presence of airborne influenza virus and found that
53% of detectable influenza virus particles were within the respirable aerosol
fraction. Our results provide evidence that influenza virus may spread through
the airborne route.
