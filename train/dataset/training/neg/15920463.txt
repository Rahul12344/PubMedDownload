Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) is caused by a lack of functional
lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Affected individuals store glycogen in
lysosomes beginning during gestation, ultimately resulting in fatal hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure. We have assessed the utility of
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors to restore GAA activity in vivo
in a mouse model of GSDII (Gaa(-/-)). A single systemic administration of a rAAV 
serotype 1 (rAAV1) vector to neonate animals resulted in restored cardiac GAA
activity to 6.4 times the normal level (mean=641+/-190% of normal (Gaa(+/+))
levels with concomitant glycogen clearance) at 11 months postinjection. Greater
than 20% of normal levels of GAA activity were also observed in the diaphragm and
quadriceps muscles. Furthermore, functional correction of the soleus skeletal
muscle was also observed compared to age-matched untreated Gaa(-/-) control
animals. These results demonstrate that rAAV1 vectors can mediate sustained
therapeutic levels of correction of both skeletal and cardiac muscles in a model 
of fatal cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy.
