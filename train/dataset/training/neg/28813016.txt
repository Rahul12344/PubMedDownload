We have isolated a novel lectin, named HRL40 from the green alga Halimeda
renschii. In hemagglutination-inhibition test and oligosaccharide-binding
experiment with 29 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, HRL40 exhibited a strict
binding specificity for high-mannose N-glycans having an exposed (α1-3) mannose
residue in the D2 arm of branched mannosides, and did not have an affinity for
monosaccharides and other oligosaccharides examined, including complex N-glycans,
an N-glycan core pentasaccharide, and oligosaccharides from glycolipids. The
carbohydrate binding profile of HRL40 resembled those of Type I high-mannose
specific antiviral algal lectins, or the Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA)
family, which were previously isolated from red algae and a blue-green alga
(cyanobacterium). HRL40 potently inhibited the infection of influenza virus
(A/H3N2/Udorn/72) into NCI-H292 cells with half-maximal effective dose (ED50) of 
2.45 nM through high-affinity binding to a viral envelope hemagglutinin (KD, 3.69
× 10-11 M). HRL40 consisted of two isolectins (HRL40-1 and HRL40-2), which could 
be separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Both isolectins had the same molecular weight
of 46,564 Da and were a disulfide -linked tetrameric protein of a 11,641 Da
polypeptide containing at least 13 half-cystines. Thus, HRL40, which is the first
Type I high-mannose specific antiviral lectin from the green alga, had the same
carbohydrate binding specificity as the OAA family, but a molecular structure
distinct from the family.
