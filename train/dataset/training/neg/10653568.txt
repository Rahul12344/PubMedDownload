A long-finned pilot whale with morbilliviral disease was stranded in New Jersey. 
An immunohistochemical stain demonstrated morbilliviral antigen. Reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for morbillivirus P and N genes was
positive. Novel sequences most closely related to, but distinct from, those of
dolphin and porpoise morbilliviruses suggest that this virus may represent a
third member of the cetacean morbillivirus group.
