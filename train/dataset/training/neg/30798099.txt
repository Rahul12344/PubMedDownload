Severe pneumonia and ARDS caused by human adenovirus B21 infections (HAdV-B21) is
a rare, but a devastating disease with rapid progression to multiorgan failure
and death. However, only a few cases were reported so far. Infections appear
associated with increased disease severity and higher mortality in infected
critically ill patients. Possible factors contributing to infection are
underlying psychiatric disease resulting in institutionalization of respective
patients, and polytoxicomania. Controlled data on the therapy of severe
adenovirus infections are lacking and remains experimental. In conclusion, data
on HAdV-B21 infections causing severe pneumonia or ARDS are scarce. Controlled
clinical trials on the therapy of adenovirus pneumonia are non existent and thus 
there is no established therapy so far. ICU physicians should be aware of this
potentially devastating disease and further studies are needed.
