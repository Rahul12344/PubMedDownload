Astroviruses are one of the leading causes of diarrhea worldwide. In spite of its
impact on human health, little is known about astrovirus pathogenesis. One reason
for this may be the lack of a suitable small animal model for infection. In
recent years, there has been increasing information on the mechanism of
astrovirus-induced disease in mammals (including humans) and birds. This review
summarizes our current state of knowledge on astrovirus pathogenesis.
