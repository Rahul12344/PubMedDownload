Intestinal involvement of cryoglobulinemia is an uncommon manifestation and
marker of severe vasculitis. We describe the case of a woman admitted to our
service for management of acute renal failure and progressive gastrointestinal
symptoms after initiating hepatitis C virus treatment with ribavirin and
sofosbuvir 4 weeks prior. With an undetectable hepatitis C viral load and
persistent symptoms despite hepatitis C virus therapy cessation, an upper
endoscopy revealed duodenal sloughing, erythema, and bleeding, sparking suspicion
for recurrence of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
