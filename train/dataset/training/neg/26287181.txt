Borna disease virus (BDV) persists in the central nervous systems of a wide
variety of vertebrates and causes behavioral disorders. Previous studies have
revealed that metabolic perturbations are associated with BDV infection. However,
the pathophysiological effects of different viral strains remain largely unknown.
Rat cortical neurons infected with human strain BDV Hu-H1, laboratory BDV Strain 
V, and non-infected control (CON) cells were cultured in vitro. At day 12
post-infection, a gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
metabonomic approach was used to differentiate the metabonomic profiles of 35
independent intracellular samples from Hu-H1-infected cells (n = 12), Strain
V-infected cells (n = 12), and CON cells (n = 11). Partial least squares
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to demonstrate discrimination
between the three groups. Further statistical testing determined which individual
metabolites displayed significant differences between groups. PLS-DA demonstrated
that the whole metabolic pattern enabled statistical discrimination between
groups. We identified 31 differential metabolites in the Hu-H1 and CON groups (21
decreased and 10 increased in Hu-H1 relative to CON), 35 differential metabolites
in the Strain V and CON groups (30 decreased and 5 increased in Strain V relative
to CON), and 21 differential metabolites in the Hu-H1 and Strain V groups (8
decreased and 13 increased in Hu-H1 relative to Strain V). Comparative
metabonomic profiling revealed divergent perturbations in key energy and amino
acid metabolites between natural strain Hu-H1 and laboratory Strain V of BDV. The
two BDV strains differentially alter metabolic pathways of rat cortical neurons
in vitro. Their systematic classification provides a valuable template for
improved BDV strain definition in future studies.
