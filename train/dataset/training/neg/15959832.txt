The population structure and diversity within a Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd)
isolate was estimated by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and
sequence analysis. A predominant sequence variant (V1) representing 52.8% of the 
overall population was identified. V1 and other additional variants presented a
composition of the P domain characteristic of severe strains of CEVd. The
nucleotide diversity of this CEVd population was lower than expected according to
a model of neutral evolution, suggesting a strong negative selection. Citron
plants were inoculated with dimeric clones of nine sequence variants and two
resulted infectious inducing the severe symptoms characteristic of the original
isolate. De novo populations were generated from these infectious variants and
like in the original CEVd isolate, both populations presented V1 as the
predominant variant but they evolved to a higher nucleotide diversity.
