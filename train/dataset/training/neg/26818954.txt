Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, the history of and immune mechanisms underlying 
vaccine-enhanced respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease and of investigations 
of mucosal antibodies and their association with viral load in RSV-infected
children, respectively, are described. This commentary discusses RSV vaccine
candidates, target populations, and the challenges associated with achieving a
safe and effective vaccine.
