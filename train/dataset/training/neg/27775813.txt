OBJECTIVES: To determine whether immune phenotypes associated with
immunosenescence are predictive of frailty and mortality within 1-year in elderly
nursing home residents.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study of frailty; prospective cohort study of mortality.
SETTING: Thirty-two nursing homes in four Canadian cities between September 2009 
and October 2011.
PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents aged 65 and older (N = 1,072, median age 86,
72% female).
MEASUREMENTS: After enrollment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained 
and analyzed using flow cytometry for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets (naïve, memory
(central, effector, terminally differentiated, senescent), and regulatory
T-cells) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Multilevel
linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between
immune phenotypes and frailty; frailty was measured at the time of enrollment
using the Frailty Index. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine
the relationship between immune phenotypes and time to death (within 1 year).
RESULTS: Mean Frailty Index was 0.44 ± 0.13. Multilevel regression analysis
showed that higher percentages of naïve CD4+ T-cells (P = .001) and effector
memory CD8+ T-cells (P = .02) were associated with a lower mean Frailty Index,
whereas a higher percentage of CD8+ central memory T-cells was associated with a 
higher mean Frailty Index score (P = .02). One hundred fifty one (14%) members of
the cohort died within 1 year. Multivariable analysis showed a significant
negative multiplicative interaction between age and percentage of CMV-reactive
CD4+ T-cells (hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-0.96). No other
significant factors were identified.
CONCLUSION: Immune phenotypes found to be predictive of frailty and mortality in 
this study can help further understanding of immunosenescence and may provide a
rationale for future intervention studies designed to modulate immunity.
