Involvement of infection agents in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis was described 
in several studies, particularly in patients with acute coronary syndrome or
ischemic stroke. However, in very few studies an association of serological
markers of chronic infection with peripheral occlusive artery disease was
analysed. The prevalence and concentration of immunoglobulin G and A to Chlamydia
pneumoniae and immunoglobulin G to CMV were measured in sera of 31 participants
suffering from peripheral occlusive artery disease. Significant difference in the
prevalance of immunoglobulin G to C. pneumoniae and CMV between study and control
groups was documented. There was no such association in reference to
immunoglobulin A to C. pneumoniae index. Serum concentration of all measured
antibodies were significantly higher in the study group than in control.
