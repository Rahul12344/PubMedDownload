A nonradioactive, biotinylated herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA probe, a shell vial
(rabbit kidney cell) culture assay enhanced by a direct fluorescent (HSV
monoclonal)-antibody stain at 16 to 20 h postinoculation, and conventional tube
cultures with confirmation via HSV-specific (polyclonal antibody)
immunoperoxidase assay were compared for 199 specimens. The predictive values of 
the positive results were 54.5% for the probe, 95.9% for the shell vial assay,
and 100% for the conventional culture methods, while the predictive values of the
negative tests were 68.1, 84.0, and 98.4%, respectively. We conclude that the DNA
probe (sensitivity, 24.5%; specificity, 88.3%) and the shell vial assay
(sensitivity, 66.2%; specificity, 98.4%) cannot be substituted for conventional
tube culture techniques (sensitivity, 97.1%; specificity, 100%) in the routine
identification of HSV in our laboratory.
