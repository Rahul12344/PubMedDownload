Evidence for capped poly(A) leaders of variable lengths located immediately
upstream of the translation initiation codon was obtained by direct analyses of a
major late mRNA species. A decapping-recapping method was used to specifically
substitute a radioactively labeled phosphate for an unlabeled one within the cap 
structure. RNase H-susceptible sites were made by hybridizing synthetic
oligodeoxyribonucleotides to the mRNA encoding a late major structural protein of
11 kilodaltons. Sequences of the type m7G(5')pppAmp (Ap)nUpG. . ., where n varies
from a few to more than 40 nucleotides, were deduced by analysis of the length
and sequence of RNase H, RNase T1, and RNase U2 digestion products.
