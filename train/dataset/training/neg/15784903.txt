The currently used vaccine strain of Rinderpest virus was derived by serial
passage of the highly virulent Kabete 'O' strain (KO). A full-length cDNA copy of
the KO strain was made from which a virus identical in pathogenicity to the
wild-type virus was rescued. A series of chimeric viruses was prepared in which
the coding sequences for the N, P, F, H or L proteins were replaced with the
corresponding sequences from the vaccine strain. The KO-based virus with the
vaccine strain H gene and that with the carboxy-terminal half of the L gene
replaced with the corresponding sequence from the vaccine strain retained all or 
almost all of the virulence of the original KO virus. Animals infected with the
KO-based virus containing the vaccine strain N, P or F gene, or the
amino-terminal half of the L gene, developed high and prolonged pyrexia and
leukopenia, but with reduced or absent lesions and other clinical signs; although
partially attenuated, none was nearly as attenuated as the vaccine strain itself.
These data indicate that the high attenuation and stability of the current
vaccine are due to the accumulation of a number of separate mutations, none of
which is itself so sufficiently debilitating that there is strong selective
pressure in favour of the revertant.
