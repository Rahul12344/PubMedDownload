BACKGROUND: The health status and needs of gypsies have been insufficiently
studied.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied the clinicoepidemiological characteristics of all
HIV-1 infected patients attending in our outpatients clinic and hospitalized who 
were classified according to their ethnic origin as <<gypsies>>, <<payos>>
(Caucasian non-gypsy Spanish natives) or <<immigrants>>.
RESULTS: Overall, there were 563 patients out of 674 previously appointed (83%). 
Intravenous drug use (IVDU) was the HIV acquisition mechanism in 70%, 95% and 25%
(p < 0.000) and attendance was considered regular in 89%, 48% and 89% payos,
gypsies and immigrants (p < 0.01), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: IVDU as the HIV transmission mechanism and lower clinic attendance
rates were the most relevant differences observed between gypsy and payo
subjects.
