Infection of BALB/c mice with the RLV-A virus normally induces an erythropoietic 
dysplasia characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, erythroblastosis, erythroblastemia
and severe anemia without reticulocytosis. Time to death varies between 20-30
weeks. Mice were inoculated with RLV-A after being hypertransfused with 75%
packed red cells for 42 days which has been shown to eliminate erythropoiesis and
modify the microenvironment to favor granulopoiesis. Following RLV-A inoculation,
one group did not receive further transfusion (short-term) and another group
continued with hypertransfusion weekly (long-term). The pathogenesis of RLV-A in 
the short-term group paralleled the characteristic RLV-A response. In the
long-term group however, the characteristic RLV-A response was never observed.
Instead, a granulocytic leukemia was developed. Continued hypertransfusion
presumably after establishment of an altered microenvironment resulted in a
completely different viral pathogenesis and the development of a transplantable
myeloid leukemia.
