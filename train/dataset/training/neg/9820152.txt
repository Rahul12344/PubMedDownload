Recently a novel DNA virus, designated TT virus (TTV), that possibly accounts for
some of the cases of liver disease of unknown aetiology, was identified in
Japanese patients. Using specific primer pairs for conserved regions, we detected
TTV DNA by PCR in 16/84 (19%) German patients awaiting orthotopic liver
transplantation because of decompensated liver cirrhosis (of diverse causes); in 
4/25 (16%) patients with non-A-G hepatitis; in 1/7 patients with autoimmune
hepatitis; and in one intravenous drug user. Sequence analysis showed that in
contrast to the findings in Japanese patients only about 37% of our TTV sequences
belonged to genomic group 1 but about 58% belonged to group 2, including several 
sequences belonging to a further subgroup tentatively designated group 2c.
Further studies to clarify whether the novel virus has hepatitis-inducing
capacity or other clinical significance are needed.
