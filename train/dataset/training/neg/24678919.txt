This editorial will assess a proposed link between herpes zoster ophthalmicus and
subsequent stoke. Herpes zoster (also called shingles) is caused by
varicella-zoster virus (VZV), one of the 9 human herpesviruses. When children
contract their primary VZV infection, virus often travels to the trigeminal
ganglia and establishes latency. Upon reactivation in late adulthood, the same
virus travels anterograde to cause herpes zoster ophthalmicus. In some people,
the virus also traffics from the same trigeminal ganglion along afferent fibers
around the carotid artery and its branches. Subsequently VZV-induced inflammation
within the affected cerebral arteries leads to occlusion and stroke. In one
retrospective analysis of people with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, there was a 4.5
fold higher risk of stroke than in a control group. Two other studies found a
less compelling association.
