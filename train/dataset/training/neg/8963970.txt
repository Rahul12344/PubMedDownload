T-cell predominant balanitis is described in a 38 year old uncircumcised
tetraplegic man whose presenting feature was non-progressive red lesions over the
inner prepuce and the glans penis without signs of infection, phimosis, or meatal
stenosis. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. He was not exposed to any of the
high risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. As the lesion did
not respond to topical antibacterial, antifungal, and corticosteroid medications 
applied in that order, circumcision was performed. Following circumcision, the
remaining lesion over the glans penis regressed completely over a period of 1
month. Histopathology of the excised prepuce revealed that both areas of normal
nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium as well as areas with hyperplasia. No atypia 
was noted and Bowenoid changes were not seen. Immunohistochemical studies on the 
inflammatory infiltrate in the excised prepucial lesion using tissue
proliferation markers (PCNA and MIB-1) revealed active proliferation of the
band-like infiltrate shown by immunophenotyping (anti-human T cell, CD45RO, clone
UCHL1 and L26, pan-B marker) to consist predominantly of T-cells, further
supporting the hypothesis of a local immune-mediated inflammatory process as the 
final pathogenic mechanism of the penile lesion.
