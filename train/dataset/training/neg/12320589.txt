PIP: The Brazilian government plans to launch an acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) awareness campaign among indigenous tribes, according to Pedro
Paulo Santana, of the Health Ministry AIDS department. The National Indian
Foundation (Funai) estimates that 20 of the 320,000 Indians in Brazil have been
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is known as the "Disease 
of Manaus (the capital of Brazil)" among the Indians; it is considered by them to
be a disease of the White man. However, because of the polygamous culture and
sexual initiation ceremonies for adolescents of many tribes, the disease is a
threat. Other Indians have been led into prostitution by "garimpeiros" (wildcat
gold and diamond miners). A woman of the Tiriyo tribe in the northern state of
Para may be spreading the disease among her people; the tribe numbers 380.
Recorded cases of HIV or AIDS among the Indians appeared 3 years ago.
