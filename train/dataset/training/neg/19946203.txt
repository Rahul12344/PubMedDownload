Smallpox has been eradicated but stockpiles of the causative infectious agent,
variola virus, have been maintained over decades. Today, the threat of accidental
or intentional poxvirus release is accompanied by the fact that the existing
licensed smallpox vaccines cause rare but severe adverse reactions yet are the
only products with approved efficacy against smallpox. New safer vaccines and new
strategies of immunization are to be developed to fit to a scenario of emergency 
smallpox vaccination. However, we still lack knowledge about the pathogen and the
mechanisms involved in acquiring protective immunity. Here, we review the history
of smallpox vaccines and recent achievements in the development of highly
efficacious and safer vaccines and vaccine applications. These include i)
assessment of adequate animal models to study pathogenesis and protective
immunity, ii) characterization of the immunity elicited by next generation
vaccines, and (iii) the investigation of the requirements for rapidly protective 
vaccination.
