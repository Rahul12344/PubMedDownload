Plant viruses: a tool-box for genetic engineering and crop protection.

Wilson TM.

Traditionally, plant viruses are viewed as harmful, undesirable pathogens.
However, their genomes can provide several useful 'designer functions' or
'sequence modules' with which to tailor future gene vectors for plant or general 
biotechnology. The majority (77%) of known plant viruses have single-stranded RNA
of the messenger (protein coding) sense as their genetic material. Over the past 
4 years, improved in vitro transcription systems and the construction of partial 
or full-length DNA copies of several plant RNA viruses have enhanced our ability 
to manipulate and study their genomes, particularly in the context of their
pathogenic interactions with host plants. Recently, two forms of genetically
engineered protection against plant virus infections have been reported. In both,
a virus-related 'interfering' molecule was stably introduced into plants via the 
DNA-transfer mechanism of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. To date, the choice of
'interfering' molecule has been guided by empirical field-observations and each
is effective against only a narrow range of closely-related viruses. As yet, we
do not fully understand the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the observed
protection. The ability to manipulate the plant-pathogen relationship is a
powerful tool to increase our knowledge and improve future strategies for
unconventional cropprotection by genetic engineering techniques.
