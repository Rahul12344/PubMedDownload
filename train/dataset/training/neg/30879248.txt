Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is considered to be endemic in Ghana. However, our
knowledge of the local epidemiology of the disease is restricted by a lack of
serological information and data for characterized viruses causing field
outbreaks. In order to improve our understanding of the prevailing situation,
this study was initiated to establish the FMD viruses (FMDV) circulating in the
country. During 2016, sera (n = 93) and epithelia/oral swab (n = 20) samples were
collected from cattle from four districts in Southern Ghana that experienced FMD 
outbreaks. Sera were analyzed using the PrioCHECK® FMDV non-structural protein
(NSP) ELISA whereas the epithelia/oral swab samples were examined by virus
isolation, antigen ELISA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), and sequencing of VP1 followed by phylogenetic analysis. Assay for
antibodies against FMDV NSPs provided evidence of exposure to FMDV in 88.2%
(82/93) of the sera tested. Serotypes O and A viruses were detected from clinical
samples by RT-PCR and sequencing of VP1. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 coding
sequences revealed that the serotype O viruses belonged to the West Africa (WA)
topotype and were most closely related to viruses from Niger and Benin, while the
serotype A viruses clustered within genotype IV (G-IV) of the Africa topotype and
were most closely related to viruses from Nigeria. This study provides useful
information on FMDV serotypes and viral lineages that circulate in Ghana and West
Africa that may aid in the formulation of effective FMD control strategies.
