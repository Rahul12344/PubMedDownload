The sim gene of bacteriophage P1 causes exclusion of a superinfecting P1 phage.
We determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1.9-kb DNA fragment that, in plasmids,
causes Sim phenotype. There are two open reading frames within this region for
proteins of 82 and 259 amino acids. A 1.3-kb fragment containing the larger open 
reading frame was inserted into an expression vector. Induced cells carrying the 
hybrid plasmid, termed pBD5, were not infected by phage P1 and produced a 24-kDa 
protein and, to a smaller extent, a 25-kDa protein. The 24-kDa protein was
purified. Comparison of its amino-terminal amino acid sequence with the
nucleotide sequence indicated that it is processed from a precursor protein by
removal of a hydrophobic leader peptide of 20 amino acids. In vivo processing
depends on secA gene function and is necessary for Sim interference with P1
infection. The data are discussed with respect to the function of the sim gene in
superinfection exclusion.
