Sulphated acid mucopolysaccharides in SV40-transformed human cells from normal
and mucopolysaccharidosis patients.

Webb T.

Lines of fibroblasts have been established from normal individuals and from
patients diagnosed as suffering from one of the mucopolysaccharidoses or
mucopolysaccharide-storage diseases. Transformation of these lines with SV40
virus has been found to reduce their capacity to secrete sulphated
mucopolysaccharides into the growth medium. No differences were detected between 
the individual cell types in their secretory capacity, either before or after
viral transformation. A direct relationship was found to exist between the rate
of acid mucopolysaccharide production and cell-doubling time. The level of
sulphated mucopolysaccharide detected within the cell was also reduced for all
cell types after transformation by SV40. Transformed fibroblasts from
mucopolysaccharidosis patients, however, showed a relatively greater reduction in
storage capacity than those derived from normal individuals.
