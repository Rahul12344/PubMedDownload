Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading
cause of cancer-related death worldwide. GC is a heterogeneous disease and the
endpoint of a long multistep process largely influenced by Helicobacter pylori
infection, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors. In a subset of GC
cases, infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may also be involved. The
development of GC is the consequence of the accumulation of multiple epi/genetic 
changes during the patient's lifetime that will result in oncogenic activation
and/or tumor suppressor pathways' inactivation. This review will focus on the
most recent updates on the characterization of the molecular phenotypes of
sporadic and hereditary GC. This article will also update the most recent
findings on the relationship between H. pylori infection and stem cells at the
origin of GC. The understanding of the molecular genetics underlying gastric
carcinogenesis is of paramount importance to identify novel potential targets for
the development of screening and prognostic markers that can be clinically
valuable for the management of GC patients and for the design of clinical trials.
