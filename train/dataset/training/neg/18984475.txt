Chronic injury results in a wound healing response that eventually leads to
fibrosis. The response is generalized, with features common among multiple organ 
systems. In the liver, various different types of injury lead to fibrogenesis,
implying a common pathogenesis. Although several specific therapies for patients 
who have different liver diseases have been successfully developed, including
antiviral therapies for those who have hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus
infection, specific and effective antifibrotic therapy remains elusive. Over the 
past 2 decades, great advances in the understanding of fibrosis have been made
and multiple mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrogenesis uncovered. Elucidation of
these mechanisms has been of fundamental importance in highlighting novel
potential therapies. Preclinical studies have indicated several putative
therapies that might abrogate fibrogenesis. This article emphasizes mechanisms
underlying fibrogenesis and reviews available and future therapeutics.
