Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs frequently in patients with the
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but at present only a few reports have
addressed the analysis of intrathecal IgG synthesis in human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-seropositive patients with no signs of HIV-related neurologic
syndromes. In this study, intrathecal IgG synthesis was investigated using
several techniques in patients with different stages of HIV infection and then
correlated with the state of the blood-brain barrier. Almost all patients had
specific anti-HIV IgG synthesis within the CNS, suggesting the presence of HIV in
the brain. These findings further stress that direct CNS infection occurs early
in the course of systemic virus spread.
