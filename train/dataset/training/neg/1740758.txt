Plasmid proviral molecular clones of the LAI isolate of HIV-1 and the ROD isolate
of HIV-2 were originally prepared in moderate copy number plasmids derived from
pBR322, which contains the colE1 origin of replication. In these plasmid vectors,
the HIV sequences are stable to continuous passage in bacteria. However, when the
colE1 origin was replaced by the mutant origin from pUC18, pGEM, or pBluescript
plasmids, which replicates to much higher copy numbers in bacteria, then
deletions of HIV sequences occurred even in RecA defective strains. Deletions
occurred in two different media, at room temperature and 37 degrees C, and with
or without plasmid amplification in the presence of chloramphenicol. These
results raise a cautionary note when cloning immunodeficiency viral sequences
into plasmid vectors containing a high copy number origin of replication.
