We analysed the clinical and pathologic features of 42 patients with
immunologically confirmed peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The median age was 60 years
and the male to female ratio was 1:1. A prior lymphoproliferative or autoimmune
disorder was present in 14 per cent of the patients. Signs of advanced disease
were usually present from the onset, such as B symptoms (55 per cent),
generalized lymphadenopathy (57 per cent), stage III/IV disease (62 per cent),
and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (68 per cent). Primary
extranodal disease (14 per cent), hepatomegaly (12 per cent), splenomegaly (12
per cent), lung/pleural involvement (12 per cent), skin involvement (21 per
cent), and bone marrow involvement (28 per cent) were uncommon. Lymphocytopenia
was present in 64 per cent of the patients, and none of nine patients tested were
serologically positive for human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV-I)
infection. Among 38 patients receiving combination chemotherapy, 20 (53 per cent)
achieved a complete remission. The actuarial median survival of all patients was 
17 months. Age greater than 60 years and stage III/IV disease predicted a poor
clinical outcome, whereas the large cell histological subtype predicted a
favourable outcome. Prospective clinical studies using uniform treatments and a
uniform histologic classification scheme are needed to confirm these findings.
