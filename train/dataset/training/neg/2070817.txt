Herbimycin A, which has been known to inactivate and degrade p60v-src tyrosine
kinase, induced an elevated synthesis of a protein with a molecular size of 70
kDa in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. This protein showed the same
migration distance on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as that of the
protein induced in the cells by heat shock treatment, and this 70-kDa protein was
identified as a member of the heat shock protein 70 family (hsp70) through
immunoprecipitation with anti-hsp72/73 antibody and partial digestion with V8
protease. The induced level of the 70-kDa protein was dependent on the length of 
period and the concentration of herbimycin A treatment. Cellular fractionation
and indirect immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the 70-kDa protein induced
by herbimycin A was localized in the cytoplasm, in contrast to the nuclear
distribution of hsp70 induced by heat treatment. Induction of hsp70 by herbimycin
A was also observed in several other cells, including HeLa S3 cells, chicken
embryo fibroblasts, NIH3T3 cells, and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed NIH3T3
cells.
