Several novel compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of the HCV (JFH-1
isolate) infection in vitro. Human serum did not significantly reduce antiviral
activity of the lead compound, AVR560 (< 4-fold). The immunohistochemistry
studies with the Huh7 cell line, infectable with the HCV (JFH-1 strain),
demonstrated that AVR560 inhibited the early steps of viral infection and blocked
the spread of the HCV infection in tissue culture. The cytotoxicity in Huh7 and
Vero-76 cell lines was mild. AVR560 proved to be a specific HCV inhibitor and
exhibited no activity against other flaviviruses such as yellow fever (strain
17D), West Nile (strain NY99), and dengue (New Guinea type 2) in in vitro
infection experiments. AVR560 also did not inhibit any of the tested human CYP450
isozymes (3A4, 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6). In the pharmacokinetic studies in mice, rats
and dogs, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and good oral bioavailability were
observed for AV560. Further pre-clinical studies with this novel HCV inhibitor
are in progress.
