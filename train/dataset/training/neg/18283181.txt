BACKGROUND: Recently, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) reactivation has been
frequently observed in patients with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or
drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms but not in patients with other 
types of drug eruptions, eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN). This finding suggests that there is a close relationship
between HHV-6 reactivation and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.
OBSERVATIONS: A 71-year-old man who was not immunocompromised developed TEN
because of zonisamide therapy. After the onset of the rash, significant increases
in HHV-6 IgG titers and HHV-6 DNA levels were observed in the patient's whole
blood samples, indicating that an HHV-6 reactivation had occurred. Furthermore,
the patient's clinical manifestations of TEN appeared to recur concurrently with 
HHV-6 reactivation. Conclusion Our case suggests that HHV-6 reactivation may also
occur in several types of drug eruptions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 
TEN.
