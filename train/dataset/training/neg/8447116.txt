This study was carried out with the aim of developing a production process for
the manufacture of a highly purified factor VIII concentrate which is virus
inactivated by pasteurization in liquid phase. Beside standard plasma protein
separation techniques, the procedure uses a chromatographic step on anion
exchanger, whose selectivity is increased by using high, but not destabilizing
salt concentrations. The final product before stabilization has a specific
activity higher than 300 IU/mg of protein, namely the highest specific activity
reported for human factor VIII concentrates purified without the use of
immunoadsorbents.
