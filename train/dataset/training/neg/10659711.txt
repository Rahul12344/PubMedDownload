In Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-infected tobacco plants carrying the N resistance
gene, a hypersensitive reaction or response (HR) occurs to enclose the virus in
the infected tissue. Although a contribution of peroxidases to the resistance has
been proposed, no evidence has been presented that tobacco peroxidase genes
respond to HR. Here, we describe the HR-induced expression of a tobacco
peroxidase gene (tpoxC1) whose induction kinetics were slightly different from
those of acidic and basic tobacco pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes.
Interestingly, tpoxC1 was insensitive to the inducers of PR genes such as
salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and ethephon. Spermine activated tpoxC1 gene
expression at a low level and both acidic and basic PR gene expression at a
considerably higher level. These results indicate that the induced expression of 
tpoxC1 is regulated differently from that of classical tobacco PR genes in the N 
gene-mediated self-defense system in tobacco plants.
