Emotions run high when it comes to who should and who should not be tested for
HIV. Now, as the debate heats up over screening of all pregnant women and their
babies, primary care physicians may find themselves caught in the fray. Recent
approval of home HIV test kits allows patients to test themselves, but can the
results be trusted? Dr. Wong summarizes the contentious issues, looks at the
debate from both sides, provides supportive documentation when available, and
points out the "knowledge gaps."
