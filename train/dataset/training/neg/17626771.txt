There have been millions of people found to have AIDS. Death rates from AIDS have
declined 15% to 20% in the past 5 years. However, nearly 75000 people will die
with AIDS in this year. Patients with AIDS are also at risk for developing both
Aids-defining cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and
non-Aids-defining cancers and opportunistic infections. In patients with advanced
Aids, the Cytomegalovirus is a frequent cause of chorioretinitis, pneumonitis,
chronic perineal ulcerations and oesophagitis. It has been involved in endocrine,
bone marrow, central nervous system and kidney abnormalities. CMV infection of
the small bowel accounts for only 4.3% of all cytomegalovirus infection of the GI
tract (large bowel 47%, duodenum 21,7%, stomach 17,4%); isolated cases of small
bowel perforation due to CMV have been reported in AIDS patients, and all but one
patient died. The Authors report a rare case of an HIV-positive young man with
gastroenteric Cytomegalovirus infection responsible for generalized peritonitis
from multiple perforations.
