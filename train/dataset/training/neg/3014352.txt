Lack of evidence for involvement of known human retroviruses in multiple
sclerosis.

Karpas A, Kämpf U, Sidèn A, Koch M, Poser S.

The recent report by Koprowski et al. that human T-cell lymphotropic retroviruses
(HTLVs) may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) has aroused
much interest. The report was based largely on immunological evidence, using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with viral antigens or disrupted
virions. We have accordingly sought confirmation by screening sera and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from MS patients against cell lines infected
respectively with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) virus (ATLV/HTLV-I) of Japanese
cells (MT-1 and MT-2 lines), our own isolate from British black patients with
ATL, the MoT cell line which produce HTLV-II, and our own T-cell line containing 
a local isolate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus
(C-LAV/HTLV-III). We have failed to find antibodies against these retroviruses in
the sera or CSF. Furthermore, neither virus could be isolated from the peripheral
white blood cells of two MS patients.
