The plant used in the characterization of Fragaria chiloensis latent virus
(FClLV) contained double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bands that did not correspond in
size to the genomic or subgenomic RNAs of known strawberry viruses. Using shotgun
cloning, sequences of a cryptic virus, named Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus
(FCCV), were obtained. This communication presents the complete genome sequence
of FCCV. The genome of FCCV consists of three monocistronic RNAs, an unusual
feature for cryptic viruses that are normally bipartite. The largest molecule
encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, while the other two encode closely
related proteins predicted to be the coat proteins of the virus. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that FCCV is related most closely to members of the
fungi-infecting Partitivirus genus rather than members of the plant-infecting
Alphacryptovirus, providing a possible insight into the evolution of cryptic
viruses. More than 300 strawberry plants from North and South America were tested
for FCCV, and the virus was only detected in plants from South America.
