The nucleocapsid of flavivirus particles does not have a recognizable capsid
structure when using icosahedral averaging for cryo-electron microscopy structure
determinations. The apparent absence of a definitive capsid structure could be
due to a lack of synchronization of the symmetry elements of the external
glycoprotein layer with those of the core or because the nucleocapsid does not
have the same structure within each particle. A technique has been developed to
determine the structure of the capsid, and possibly also of the genome, for
icosahedral viruses, such as flaviviruses, using cryo-electron microscopy. The
method is applicable not only to the analyses of viral cores, but also to the
missing structure of multi-component complexes due to symmetry mismatches. The
density contributed by external glycoprotein and membrane layers, derived from
previously determined three-dimensional icosahedrally averaged reconstructions,
was subtracted from the raw images of the virus particles. The resultant
difference images were then used for a three-dimensional reconstruction. After
appropriate test data sets were constructed and tested, the procedure was applied
to examine the nucleocapsids of flaviviruses, which showed that there is no
distinct protein density surrounding the genome. Furthermore, there was no
evidence of any icosahedral symmetry within the nucleocapsid core.
