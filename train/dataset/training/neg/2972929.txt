A lambda gt11 expression library was constructed using mRNA from the promastigote
form of Leishmania donovani (African isolate MHOM/ET/67/HU3). The library was
screened with serum obtained from a patient who contracted visceral leishmaniasis
in the Sudan. Several cDNA clones which expressed beta-galactosidase/L. donovani 
antigen fusion proteins were isolated. One of these clones corresponded to a 60
kDa membrane-associated antigen. By a Western blot assay antibodies against the
fusion protein were detected universally in the sera of visceral leishmaniasis
patients. They were not detected in sera from patients with cutaneous
leishmaniasis or other parasitic protozoan infections. The gene coding for this
antigen was specific to the genus Leishmania as judged by DNA hybridisation, and 
its chromosomal location was conserved. A 20 kb mRNA was detected on Northern
blots of promastigote RNA.
