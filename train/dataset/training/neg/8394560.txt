The salivary disease in two patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection 
was investigated by technetium pertechnetate scintiscanning. Although there was
good histologic evidence of benign lymphoepithelial disease, scintiscanning
failed to delineate any salivary lesions. Technetium pertechnetate scintiscanning
seems to be of little value in the detailed investigation of salivary disease in 
human immunodeficiency virus infection, though gallium scanning can help. Fine
needle aspiration or biopsy remain the main diagnostic tools.
