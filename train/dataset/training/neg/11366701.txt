AIDS: March 8 marked the beginning of the first HIV vaccine effectiveness trial
in the San Francisco Bay Area, being conducted by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health and the University of California at San Francisco. This phase III
trial is expected to run four years in more than 50 locations, and enroll 5,000
participants in the U.S. The study will test a recombinant vaccine known as
AIDSVAX B/B, developed by VaxGen. A similar trial will enroll 2,500 injection
drug users in Thailand. In related news, the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases launched a vaccine trial in Africa in February. The phase I
trial will enroll 40 HIV-negative participants in Uganda and will test Alvac, a
vaccine produced by Pasteur Merieux Connaught. Contact information for the San
Francisco Bay Area trial is provided.
