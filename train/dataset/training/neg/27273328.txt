Ophthalmic herpes simplex viral keratitis is responsible for a range of ocular
manifestations from superficial epithelial disease to stromal keratitis and
endotheliitis. The Herpetic Eye Disease Study has guided the management of
herpetic eye disease for almost twenty years, but newer medications such as
valacyclovir are now available and are considered to have better bioavailability 
than acyclovir. In this review, we examine the existing evidence on the
pathogenesis of different ophthalmic herpes simplex viral keratitis disease
modalities and the role of oral and topically administered antiviral drugs in the
treatment of herpes simplex viral keratitis.
