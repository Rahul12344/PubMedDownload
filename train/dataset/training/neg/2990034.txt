Malignant transformation of erythroid cells in vivo by introduction of a
nonreplicating retrovirus vector.

Wolff L, Ruscetti S.

DNA from a replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) was
reconstructed and transfected into psi-2 cells containing a packaging-defective
mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Replication-incompetent retrovirus
particles (helper virus-free containing genomes that express the transforming
envelope gene of SFFV (gp52) transformed bone marrow cells in vitro and, after
direct intravenous introduction of the vector, induced malignant erythroid
disease in vivo. Disease induction was dependent on prior treatment of mice with 
phenylhydrazine, which probably increased the availability of erythroid target
cells. Since there was no evidence of virus particle expression in mice with
malignant disease, this study demonstrates the acute oncogenic potential of a
limited number of erythroid cells expressing SFFV gp52. Direct inoculation of
animals with nonreplicating retroviral vectors containing transforming genes may 
be useful in study the oncogenic effects of such genes.
