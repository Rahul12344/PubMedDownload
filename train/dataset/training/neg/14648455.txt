In a cross-sectional study of 1111 injection drug users (IDUs) admitted to a
hospital detoxification unit between 1987 and 2001, characteristics of substance 
abuse and blood samples were obtained at study entry. The median age at admission
was 27 years, the median age at first injection of drugs was 19 years, and the
median duration of injection drug use was 84 months. Overall prevalence of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was 60% (58% in men, 66% in women;
P=.026). Age at start of and duration of injection drug use were associated with 
HIV infection (P<.001). The rate of HIV infection in persons with short duration 
of drug use (<24 months) was higher among women (45%) than among men (21%)
(P=.002). The prevalence of HIV infection among IDUs <21 years old at first use
of injection drugs and among patients reporting <48 months of injection drug use 
was significantly lower in those who started injection drug use after 1992 (19%
vs. 53% of IDUs; odds ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-10.85).
Awareness of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, preventive measures, and
substance abuse treatment have contributed to the stabilization of the HIV
epidemic. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among women IDUs and among young
IDUs who recently began injecting drugs emphasizes the need to target
HIV-transmission risk reduction interventions early.
