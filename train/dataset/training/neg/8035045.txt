To determine the frequency of the parasitic pathogens in human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-infected patients in a developing world setting, 295 stool specimens 
were examined from 166 HIV-positive patients (49% with AIDS) at São José
Hospital, Fortaleza, Brazil, from September 1990 to March 1992. Significantly
more patients with diarrhea (85%) than without (66%) had AIDS or AIDS-related
complex (ARC) (P < .005). Of the potential parasitic causes of diarrhea, only
Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia were significantly associated with
diarrheal disease. Infections with C. parvum, but not microsporidia, were
associated with the rainy season (P < .005). Thus, C. parvum and microsporidia
are the most common intestinal parasites associated with diarrhea in an
HIV-infected population in Brazil and are associated with advanced HIV disease.
The association of C. parvum infections with the rainy season suggests that
contaminated water may be important in its transmission; however, the source of
human microsporidia requires further investigation.
