The spectrum of major infections after transplantation has undergone a striking
evolution. The epidemiologic trends in infectious diseases through the last
decade have been most notable for a dramatic decrease in the incidence of several
opportunistic infections, largely because of advances in prophylaxis against
these pathogens. Paralleling these trends has been an exponential rise in the
proportion of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. These
multiresistant organisms have now emerged as leading pathogens at many transplant
centers, and their management is a daunting challenge.
