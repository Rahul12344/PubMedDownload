A 57-year-old Caucasian woman with known autoimmune hypothyroidism diagnosed in
2006 presented to hospital with flu-like symptoms and circulatory collapse. She
reported weight loss and gradual increase in her skin pigmentation over a 1-year 
period. Aggressive fluid resuscitation was instituted. Hormonal tests showed
primary adrenal insufficiency. Appropriate steroid replacement was started with
rapid clinical response. Subsequent antibody tests confirmed the diagnosis of
autoimmune polyglandular type 2 (Schmidt's) syndrome. The adrenal crisis had been
precipitated by influenza virus type B infection.
