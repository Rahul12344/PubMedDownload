The C3 neutralization epitope of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) is a continuous epitope
comprised within residues 93-103 of capsid protein VP1. These residues form a
loop at the surface of the virus particle. The authors compared the
immunogenicity of two peptides which contain this epitope, when presented at the 
surface of Escherichia coli by genetic insertion in the outer membrane protein
LamB. One peptide was 13 residues long (VP1:93-103) and the other one contained
flanking sequences increasing its size to 35 residues (VP1:86-115). Mice and
rabbits were immunized with recombinant bacteria expressing the corresponding
LamB-VP1 hybrid proteins. Antibodies against synthetic peptides, against native
and heat denatured viral particles, as well as neutralizing antibodies were
monitored. In this mode of presentation the shortest form of the epitope was more
immunogenic. We provide evidence that the conformation of the epitope is
different in the two hybrid LamB proteins and discuss possible consequences for
immunogenicity.
