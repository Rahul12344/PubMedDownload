The objective of this study was to investigate the association hypothesis that
outcome following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induced bronchiolitis (RSVB) 
and RSV induced wheeze (RSVW) are different. At 3 years respiratory symptoms were
more common in those with RSV infection than the control group but there was no
increase in allergic sensitisation (11% vs 10%). Those with RSVW were more likely
to have evidence of allergic sensitisation when compared with RSVB subjects (22% 
vs 7%), and have increased symptoms and increased use of inhaled
steroids.CONCLUSION: The data argue that RSV infection during infancy does not
induce allergic asthma and that host factors rather than the virus determine
long-term outcomes.
