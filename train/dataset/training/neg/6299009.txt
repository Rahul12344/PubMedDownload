Characterization of Herpesvirus saimiri and Herpesvirus ateles structural
proteins.

Modrow S, Wolf H.

The structural proteins of Herpesvirus saimiri strains 11 and 11 att and of
Herpesvirus ateles strains 73 and 810 were characterized by electrophoresis in
SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For H. saimiri 21 virus structural proteins could be
identified with molecular weights ranging from 28,000 to 210,000 Da. For H.
ateles 810 and H. ateles 73, 20 polypeptides were characterized. Using
lactoperoxidase for iodination of surface proteins and immunoprecipitation, 5
polypeptides could be identified as envelope and 4 as capsid surface proteins.
