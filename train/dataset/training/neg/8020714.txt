Brakman GG.

To abolish inhibitors, 40 out of 60 hemophiliacs (57 patients and 3 with
hemophilia A and B, respectively) were treated according to the therapeutic
scheme specified as Bonn protocol. A complete disappearance of the inhibitors was
achieved in all the patients. These were followed up for 13 years during which
they received on demand standard hemostatic treatment. No inhibitors have been
registered so far.
