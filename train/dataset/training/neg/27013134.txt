Host-targeting antivirals have an advantage over direct-acting antivirals in that
they have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Here, we describe in vivo
anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) efficacy of a potent siRNA targeting the protein
kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2), which phosphorylates HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase and promotes HCV replication. PRK2-silencing reduced the
phosphorylated NS5B level and resulted in inhibition of NS5B RdRp activity to
decrease HCV genome abundance. Systemic administration of lipidoid
nanoparticle-formulated PRK2 siRNA (once every three days for a total of three
injections at a dose of 3mgkg(-1)) resulted in a 3.72 and 1.96 log10 reduction in
serum HCV RNA titer, in mouse subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models for
HCV replication, respectively. Our results verify the essential role of PRK2 in
HCV replication and offer a host-targeting anti-HCV siRNA therapy that might be
beneficial for non-responders to current treatment regimens.
