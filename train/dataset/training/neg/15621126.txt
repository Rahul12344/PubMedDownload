Plasma cell proliferative disorder (PCPD) developed in two patients with actively
replicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in neoplastic plasma cells after orthotopic
liver transplantation for HCV-related end-stage liver disease. PCPD was confined 
to the transplanted liver and was associated with monoclonal proteins in blood.
Bone marrow biopsy did not show any evidence of PCPD. Epstein-Barr virus was not 
detected by in situ hybridization in either case. In situ hybridization for HCV
RNA with sense and antisense probes in liver biopsy specimens showed signals in
neoplastic plasma cells as well as in hepatocytes. We suggest that our patients
had posttransplant PCPD resulting from HCV. It may represent a new posttransplant
disease entity different from previously described posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorder. The findings raise intriguing questions about the
role of HCV in PCPDs in patients with chronic HCV infection.
