Ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradient remains the most commonly used
technique for hRSV purification. However, the high viscosity and hyper-osmotic
property of sucrose can cause damage to the extremely labile virus leading to
loss of infectivity. To overcome these limitations, an alternative purification
technique was developed using iodixanol as gradient medium, incorporating MgSO(4)
as a stabilizing agent and EDTA to disaggregate the virus prior to infectivity
assay. Virus particles were banded at the 20-36% interface after purification of 
polyethylene glycol-concentrated viruses by rate zonal ultracentrifugation on a
20-52% discontinuous iodixanol gradient. The presence of the virus was confirmed 
by viral fusion glycoprotein content using ELISA. After further purification by
buoyant density ultracentrifugation on a 20-52% continuous gradient, the virus
was recovered in the region of density 1.15-1.19 g/ml and this was confirmed by
the coincidence of the infectivity titre, viral genome and fusion glycoprotein
peaks. Analysis of recovery rates showed that the use of iodixanol increased the 
virus yield up to 69%. Iodixanol was also found to be non-toxic to HeLa cells
used in infectivity assay, eliminating the need of its downstream removal by
dialysis.
