Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) non-structural protein 3 (NS3) helicase is essential for 
viral replication. Cloning of human antibody fragments for binding and inhibiting
HCV helicase intracellularly (intracellular immunization) was attempted. A phage 
display system was employed to isolate human sFv fragments. A large phagemid
library was cloned from patients infected with HCV. Phages expressing human sFv
fragments with binding activity against NS3 were highly enriched during affinity 
selection. Selected sFv antibody fragments showed high affinity to HCV helicase. 
The variable domains of the cloned antibody fragments were sequenced and their
germ-line origin was determined. K(D) values describing affinity of sFv to NS3
were measured by competition-EIA. Bacterially expressed recombinant human high
affinity antibodies can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Further 
experiments will select antibody fragments inhibiting NS3 helicase. Employing
vectors for transduction of the encoding cDNA into infected cells might be a
novel gene therapy strategy for intracellular immunization against chronic HCV
infection.
