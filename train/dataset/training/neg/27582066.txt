Coxsackievirus A6 (CA6) can induce atypical hand, foot, and mouth disease, which 
is characterized by severe rash, onychomadesis and a higher rate of infection in 
adults. Increasing epidemiological data indicated that outbreaks of
CA6-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease have markedly increased worldwide in
recent years. However, the current body of knowledge on the infection, pathogenic
mechanism, and immunogenicity of CA6 is still very limited. In this study, we
established the first neonatal mouse model for the evaluation of antibodies and
vaccines against CA6. The CA6 strain CA6/141 could infect a one-day-old BALB/c
mouse through intraperitoneal and intracerebral routes. The infected mice
developed clinical symptoms, such as inactivity, wasting, hind-limb paralysis and
even death. Pathological examination indicated that CA6 showed special tropism to
skeletal muscles and skin, but not to nervous system or cardiac muscles.
Infections with CA6 could induce vesicles in the dermis without a rash in mice,
and the CA6 antigen was mainly localized in hair follicles. The strong tropism of
CA6 to the skin may be related to its severe clinical features in infants. This
mouse model was further applied to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic
antibody and an experimental vaccine against CA6. A potential mAb 1D5 could fully
protect mice from a lethal CA6 infection and also showed good therapeutic effects
in the CA6-infected mice. In addition, an inactivated CA6 vaccine was evaluated
through maternal immunization and showed 100% protection of neonatal mice from
lethal CA6 challenge. Collectively, these results indicate that this infection
model will be a useful tool in future studies on vaccines and antiviral reagents 
against CA6.
