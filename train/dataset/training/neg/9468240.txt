OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy of an interferon regimen characterized by
an early virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C and evaluated 
whether the patient's virological status during therapy would be useful for
predicting a complete response.
METHODS: We treated 62 patients with chronic hepatitis C with 6 million units
(MU) of human lymphoblastoid interferon daily for 4 wk. The serum HCV RNA was
assayed at week 2 by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HCV
RNA-negative patients (group A) received 6 MU of interferon three times weekly
for an additional 22 wk (total dose, 564 MU). HCV RNA-positive patients were
randomly assigned to group B-1, which received the same regimen as group A, or to
group B-2, which received 6 MU of interferon daily for 4 wk followed by 6 MU
three times weekly for 18 wk (total dose, 660 MU).
RESULTS: Complete responses were achieved by 19 (63.3%) of 30 group A patients,
compared with one (6.3%) of 16 group B-1 patients and none of 16 group B-2
patients. The virological response at week 2 and the pretreatment serum HCV RNA
level were independent significant predictors of a complete response.
CONCLUSION: Patients who were still HCV RNA-positive at week 2 were unlikely to
achieve a complete response after interferon therapy. An increase in the total
dose of interferon failed to yield further benefit in these patients.
