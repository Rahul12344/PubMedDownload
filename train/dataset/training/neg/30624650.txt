Herein we present major updates to the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium
(NNTC) database. The NNTC's ongoing multisite clinical research study was
established to facilitate access to ante-mortem and post-mortem data, tissues and
biofluids for the neurohuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research community.
Recently, the NNTC has expanded to include data from the central nervous system
HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study. The data and
biospecimens from CHARTER and NNTC cohorts are available to qualified researchers
upon request. Data generated by requestors using NNTC biospecimens and tissues
are returned to the NNTC upon the conclusion of requestors' work, and this
external, experimental data are annotated and curated in the publically
accessible NNTC database, thereby extending the utility of each case. A flexible 
and extensible database ontology allows the integration of disparate data sets,
including external experimental data, clinical neuropsychological and
neuromedical testing data, tissue pathology and neuroimaging data.
