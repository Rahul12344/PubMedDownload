apparatus.

Proteins synthesized in the ER are generally transported to the Golgi complex and
beyond only when they have reached a fully folded and assembled conformation. To 
analyze how the selective retention of misfolded proteins works, we monitored the
long-term fate of a membrane glycoprotein with a temperature-dependent folding
defect, the G protein of tsO45 vesicular stomatitis virus. We used indirect
immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and a novel Nycodenz gradient
centrifugation procedure for separating the ER, the intermediate compartment, and
the Golgi complex. We also employed the folding and recycling inhibitors
dithiothreitol and AIF4-, and coimmunoprecipitation with calnexin antibodies. The
results showed that the misfolded G protein is not retained in the ER alone; it
can move to the intermediate compartment and to the cis-Golgi network but is then
recycled back to the ER. In the ER it is associated with calnexin and BiP/GRP78. 
Of these two chaperones, only BiP/GRP78 seems to accompany it through the
recycling circuit. Thus, the retention of this misfolded glycoprotein is the
result of multiple mechanisms including calnexin binding in the ER and selective 
retrieval from the intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi network.
