Acyclovir (9-/2-hydroxyethoxymethyl/guanine) enhanced the plaque formation of HSV
and VZV at subinhibitory dose and inhibited at higher concentration but not in
thymidine kinase deficient viruses. The enhancement was neutralized by thymidine.
Induction of viral thymidine kinase activity was not affected with ACV. These
results suggest that the enhancement may be mediated by viral thymidine kinase.
