Lethal midline granuloma (LMG) is a clinical term, which describes a group of
diseases histologically comprising Wegener's granulomatosis, polymorphic
reticulosis (PR), and malignant lymphoma of the ordinary type (ML). PR is a
variant of ML, and is considered to be a type of NK/T cell lymphoma. Our previous
study revealed the clustering of patients with PR in East Asia including China,
Korea and Japan. However, the frequency rate of PR varied even among these
countries, with that of Korea being approximately 5 times higher than that of
Japan. In the present study, we examined the incidences of each type of LMG,
especially PR, in Korea (Yonsei University) and Japan (59 university hospitals)
over time. A total of 102 cases and 655 cases of LMG admitted to Yonsei
University, Korea from 1977 to 1996 and 59 university hospitals in Japan between 
1965 and 1996, respectively, were examined. The frequency rate of PR per 100,000 
outpatients of ears, nose and throat (ENT) clinics in Korea decreased from 40 to 
20 between the periods of 1977-1989 and 1990-1996. However, there were no
significant changes in Japan during the period studied.
