Low-avidity rubella immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in oral fluid samples
from 30 of 32 rubella IgM-positive patients (sensitivity, 94%) and from 4 of 34
IgM-negative patients (specificity, 88%). Measuring IgG avidity in oral fluid
samples could improve the reliability of rubella surveillance when the incidence 
of the disease and the positive predictive value of IgM tests are low.
