Ribosomal frameshifting on retroviral RNAs has been proposed to be mediated by
slippage of two adjacent tRNAs into the -1 direction at a specific
heptanucleotide sequence. Here we report a computer-aided analysis of the
structure around the established or putative frameshift sites in a number of
retroviral, coronaviral, toroviral, and luteoviral RNAs and two dsRNA yeast
viruses. In almost all cases a stable hairpin was predicted four to nine
nucleotides downstream of the shifty heptanucleotide. More than half of the
resulting hairpin loops give rise to potential pseudoknotting with sequences
downstream of this hairpin. Especially in the case of the shifty heptanucleotides
U UUA AAC and G GGA AAC, stable downstream pseudoknots are present. Indications
were also found for the presence of pseudoknots downstream of amber stop condons 
at readthrough sites in some retroviral RNAs.
