The risk of polytransfused patients for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is
likely to extend to another recently identified member of the Flaviviridae,
hepatitis G virus (HGV). We investigated the prevalence of HGV in 40 adult
Italian patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia and evaluated the
clinical significance of HGV infection. HGV-RNA was detected in 9/40 patients
(22.5%). HGV infection was significantly associated with HCV viraemia (P =
0.0012), with all patients positive for HGV being also viraemic for HCV. Overall,
the clinical picture of patients with HCV/HGV co-infection was not different from
that of patients with isolated HCV. However, patients co-infected with both
viruses had lower values of alanine-transferase (P = 0.035) and a lower titre of 
HCV viraemia (P = 0.042) in the absence of other evident factors which could
influence the clinical expression of HCV infection. In conclusion, HGV is highly 
prevalent among Italian polytransfused patients. No evidence of a clinically
significant pathogenic role for HGV in liver disease could be found in these
patients. In a subset of cases a possible interference of HGV with HCV infection 
was observed.
