BACKGROUND & AIMS: Viral hepatitis is a major public health challenge in Egypt
but little is known about the epidemiology of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection, its geographical distribution, or risk factors for infection in the
Egyptian context. This study addresses this deficit using data from a nationally 
representative survey.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data gathered from men and women aged 15-59 
in the Egypt Health Issues Survey (EHIS) 2015, including logistic regression to
evaluate the contribution of different factors to risk of HBV infection. This was
supplemented by spatial analysis of the distribution of acute or chronic HBV
infection at governorate level, and the ecological relationship between HBV and
HCV infections.
RESULTS: Population HBV prevalence was 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.2-1.6), with a HBV-HCV co-infection rate of 0.06%. Spatial analysis showed
localisation of HBV infected individuals primarily to urban areas of Upper Egypt 
(in contrast to HCV for which prevalence is highest in rural Lower Egypt), and
those in early middle age (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 3.32, 95% CI: 1.66-6.63).
HBV positive status among other household members emerged as a powerful driver of
infection risk in this analysis (AOR=10.75, 95% CI: 4.98-23.24).
CONCLUSION: Spatial distribution of HBV infection in Egypt differs markedly from 
HCV and co-infection rates are low. Within-household transmissions appear to be
particularly important in explaining the persistence of HBV infection in the
general population. Prevention strategies should focus on urban Upper Egypt, and 
particularly those households with documented cases of infection.
