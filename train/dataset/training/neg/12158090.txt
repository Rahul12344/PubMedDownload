PIP: AIDS has spread from a few foci at the outset of the epidemic to most of the
worldÂ¿s nations. The WHO reported 222,740 cases as of February 1990. The first
cases in Mexico were reported in 1983. By 1990, some 3944 AIDS cases were
reported, although the true number was at least 20% higher. Based on confirmed
cases, Mexico had the third highest number in the Americas, after the US and
Brazil. AIDS has spread through the general population. The proportion of
infected males per infected female dropped from 23.6 in March 1987 to 6.6 in
March 1990. High-risk practices are present in all social groups. In the early
years, AIDS predominantly affected the middle and upper social strata, but the
strongest recent increases have been in lower strata. Temporary migration to the 
US appears to have been a significant factor in spread of the diseases.
