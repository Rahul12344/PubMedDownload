Blood rheology and myalgic encephalomyelitis: a pilot study.

Simpson LO, Shand BI, Olds RJ.

The blood rheology of EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples from blood donors and
subjects considered to have myalgic encephalomyelitis was assessed by multiple
shear rate viscometry and by multiple-pressure filterability. Although average
viscosities of the two groups were different, the differences did not reach
statistical significance. In contrast, the data from multiple-pressure filtration
of whole blood showed significant differences between females at the lowest (2.5 
cm of water) filtration pressure. It appears that the acute phase of the disorder
is associated with changes in blood rheology which could impair microcirculatory 
blood flow. In contrast, the chronic state does not appear to be associated with 
rheological abnormalities.
