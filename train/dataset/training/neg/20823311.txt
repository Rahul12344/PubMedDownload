MOTIVATION: Animal toxins operate by binding to receptors and ion channels. These
proteins are short and vary in sequence, structure and function. Sporadic
discoveries have also revealed endogenous toxin-like proteins in non-venomous
organisms. Viral proteins are the largest group of quickly evolving proteomes. We
tested the hypothesis that toxin-like proteins exist in viruses and that they act
to modulate functions of their hosts.
RESULTS: We updated and improved a classifier for compact proteins resembling
short animal toxins that is based on a machine-learning method. We applied it in 
a large-scale setting to identify toxin-like proteins among short viral proteins.
Among the approximately 26 000 representatives of such short proteins, 510
sequences were positively identified. We focused on the 19 highest scoring
proteins. Among them, we identified conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors
receptor-like proteins and anti-bacterial peptides. Our predictor was shown to
enhance annotation inference for many 'uncharacterized' proteins. We conclude
that our protocol can expose toxin-like proteins in unexplored niches including
metagenomics data and enhance the systematic discovery of novel cell modulators
for drug development.
