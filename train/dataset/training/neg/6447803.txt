Exclusion of bacteriophage T1 by bacteriophage lambda. II. Synthesis of
T1-specific macromolecules under N-mediated excluding conditions.

Gawron MC, Christensen JR, Shoemaker TM.

The results of experiments investigating T1 macromolecular synthesis under
N-mediated excluding conditions failed to demonstrate a substantial alteration in
the T1 mRNA production in excluding cultures at any stage in the T1 infectious
cycle. The number of T1 DNA sequences in the excluding culture was found to be
one-third to one-half that found in T1-infected cultures. The most severe
reduction in T1-specific macromolecules was seen in protein synthesis. Total
incorporation of labeled amino acids was reduced sixfold, and gel experiments
confirmed that the T1-specific proteins capable of detection are reduced in
excluding cells.
