OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/disease 
in kidney transplant recipients receiving an mTOR-inhibitor-containing
immunosuppressive regimen without prophylactic CMV treatment.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort analysis included all de novo
kidney transplant recipients (09/15/2015-07/31/2017) receiving 3 mg/kg single
dose of rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction, tacrolimus, everolimus, and
prednisone. Preemptive therapy was initiated only in patients deemed at higher
risk for CMV infection: (a) D+/R- CMV patients; (b) after treatment for acute
rejection (ARt); and (c) after everolimus discontinuation (EVRd).
RESULTS: Of 230 patients, there were no episodes of CMV disease among 217 (94%)
without criteria to initiate preemptive therapy. Of 77 (33.5%) patients
initiating preemptive therapy, 13 were D+/R-, 30 were ARt, and 34 were EVRd. The 
overall incidence of first CMV infection/disease was 6% (46.1% in D+/R-, 13.3%
ARt [all patients had also discontinued everolimus], and 11.8% after early
[<90 days] EVRd). The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 5.6%, and
median glomerular filtration rate at month 12 was 47 mL/min/1.73m2 . One-year
patient and death-censored graft survivals were 97.4% and 98.1%.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that everolimus-containing immunosuppressive
regimen reduces the need for preventive strategies for CMV infection in the
majority of kidney transplant recipients, reducing antiviral drug-associated
toxicities and healthcare-related expenditures.
