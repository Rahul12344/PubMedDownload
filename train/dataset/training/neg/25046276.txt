Recently, Avian Bornavirus (ABV) was identified to be a new member of the
Bornaviridae family consisting solely of the mammal-infecting Borna disease virus
(BDV). Here, to gain more insights into the evolution of these bornaviruses, the 
time-stamped N gene sequences of BDV genotype 1 (BDV1) and ABV were subjected to 
Bayesian coalescent analyses. The nucleotide substitution rates and the
divergence times were estimated. Age calculations suggested that the first
diversification event of the analyzed BDV1 isolates might have taken place about 
300years ago, and revealed that ABV was an old virus newly recognized. Great
differences were observed in the rate of nucleotide substitution and the pattern 
of codon usage bias between BDV1 and ABV. Moreover, the analyzed bornaviruses
might be descended from an AT-rich ancestor.
