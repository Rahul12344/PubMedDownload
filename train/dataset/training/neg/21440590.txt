Hepatitis E is acute hepatitis caused by infection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) via
a fecal-to-oral or zoonotic route. HEV is a small, non-enveloped virus containing
positive strand RNA as a genome. Recently, the three-dimensional structures of
the HEV-like particles and spike domain protruded from the surface of the
particle expressed by recombinant baculovirus or bacteria have been revealed.
Based on these reports, the structural features of the HEV capsid subunit and
viral particle are reviewed to give insights to the mechanisms underlying the
particle assembly, antigenicity, host cell attachment and native virion
packaging.
