BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is believed to exert a suppressive effect on 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) in most HBV/HCV-coinfected patients; once HCV is cured by
interferon-based therapy, these patients may show HBV reactivation. However,
recent evidence revealed that the virological status in HBV/HCV-untreated
individuals may vary over time and may show fluctuating profiles.
METHODS: To evaluate the behaviour of apparently inactive HBV infection in
patients under treatment for a concurrent HCV infection, we performed a
prospective study that evaluated nine consecutive patients (eight males with a
median age of 45.9 years, and one female aged 62 years) longitudinally
followed-up with bi-monthly evaluation of HBV/HCV viraemia levels and liver
biochemistry during a 1-year treatment with interferon plus ribavirin.
RESULTS: In seven cases the HBV infection maintained its inactive status
independently of the HCV response to therapy. By contrast, two non-responder
cases with persistently high HCV RNA levels showed HBV DNA flairs during the
follow-up, indicating a status of active HBV infection with fluctuating
virological profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the HBV behaviour may be independent of the
HCV activity during anti-HCV therapy in HBV/HCV-coinfected patients, and that the
HBV virological profile should be monitored to recognize possible reactivations
that might lead to more proper therapeutic choices or adjustments.
