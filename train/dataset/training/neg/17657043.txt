Laboratory diagnosis is the mainstay in the diagnosis of HIV infection in an
individual. The wide range of diagnostic kits available, for the detection of
anti HIV antibodies, makes it mandatory that the kits are evaluated before they
are made available in the market. We evaluated the performance of a Microlisa HIV
kit (J. Mitra & Co.) using a panel of HIV reactive and non reactive clinical
specimens. The sensitivity and specificity of the kit were found to be 100% as
compared to the UBI HIV 1/2 EIA kit. The ease of testing, the assay
characteristics including efficiency of the Microlisa favour its use by
laboratories as a primary screen for HIV infection.
