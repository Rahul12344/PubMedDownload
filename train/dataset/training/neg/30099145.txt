BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is a common cause of acute viral hepatitis
worldwide. Typically associated with a self-limiting illness, infection may
persist in immunosuppressed populations with significant morbidity and mortality.
Based on clinical data published world-wide, UK blood safety guidance recommends 
the universal screening for HEV RNA of blood donors and donors of tissue, organs 
and stem cells.
OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the point prevalence of
HEV viraemia and clinical course of viraemic patients in the peri-transplant
period in solid organ transplant (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) recipients transplanted over a 3-year period (2013-2015).
STUDY DESIGN: Nucleic acid extracts of whole blood from patients undergoing SOT
or HSCT were tested by an in-house real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction assay for HEV RNA. Samples were tested at baseline (time of
transplant), 30, 60 and 90 days post-transplant.
RESULTS: 870 patients (259 HSCT, 262 liver and 349 kidney transplant) were
included with 2554 samples meeting the inclusion criteria. No kidney transplant
patients had HEV viraemia at time of testing. One HSCT and three liver transplant
patients were found to be HEV RNA positive. Overall this represented 0.46% of the
patients testing positive for HEV viraemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of HEV viraemia in SOT and HSCT patients in U.K. although
higher than in the general population is low at baseline and remains low
throughout the early post-transplant phase. Clearance of viraemia can be
maintained despite ongoing immunosuppression. Prospective U.K. studies are
necessary to inform screening policies in this population.
