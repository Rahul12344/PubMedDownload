Viral nanotechnology is revolutionizing the biomimetic and bioinspired synthesis 
of novel nanomaterials. Bottom-up nanofabrication by self-assembly of individual 
molecular components of elongated viral nanoparticles (VNPs) and virus-like
particles (VLPs) has resulted in the production of superior materials and
structures in the nano(bio)technological fields. Viral capsids are attractive
materials, because of their symmetry, monodispersity, and polyvalency. Helical
VNPs/VLPs are unique prefabricated nanoscaffolds with large surface area to
volume ratios and high aspect ratios, and enable the construction of exquisite
supramolecular nanostructures. This review discusses the genetic and chemical
modifications of outer, inner, and interface surfaces of a viral protein cage
that will almost certainly lead to the development of superior next-generation
targeted drug delivery and imaging systems, biosensors, energy storage and
optoelectronic devices, therapeutics, and catalysts.
