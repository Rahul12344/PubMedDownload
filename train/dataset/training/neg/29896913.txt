In Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), acute respiratory infections
overburden the health care system, but viral etiology, genetic diversity, and
seasonality, especially in light of the introduction of influenza vaccination in 
the country, are poorly understood. From August 2010 to April 2011, 309
outpatients were recruited at the Luang Prabang Provincial Hospital covering
highland Lao communities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were screened for the presence of 
13 respiratory viruses. At least one virus was detected in 69.6% and dual/triple 
viral infections in 12.9%/1.9% of the patients. Influenza A and B viruses
combined were the most frequently detected pathogens, followed by human
adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The other viruses were detected
in less than 10% of the patients. Phylogenetic analyses on a representative set
of RSV strains revealed that, while otherwise very rare, the RSV-B CB1/THB
genotype cocirculated with other common genotypes. A single wave of influenza
virus and RSV activity was observed during the rainy season, providing further
support to influenza vaccination before the onset of the rains. This study
provides recommendations for influenza vaccination that still needs optimization 
and highlights the need for revised guidelines for treatment and prevention of
respiratory infections in Lao PDR, as well as for increased surveillance efforts.
