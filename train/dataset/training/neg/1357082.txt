An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the quantification
of serum antibodies against group-specific epitopes of the glycoproteins (G1, G2)
and nucleoprotein (NP) of the genus Hantavirus. This assay was used to study the 
kinetics of the development of serum antibodies after natural infection with
Puumala-like virus in humans. To this end a panel of 34 serum samples collected
from individuals at different times after natural infection was tested by the
ELISA. The samples were also tested for specific IgM and IgG levels against
Puumala-like virus, which provided confirmatory data about the presumed timing of
infection. It was shown that serum antibodies against the G1 epitope were present
in the acute and early convalescent period just before antibodies to the NP
epitope could be demonstrated. In contrast, antibodies to two G2 epitopes were
present not earlier than in the convalescent and late convalescent period. Since 
all these categories of antibodies seem to persist for long periods, antibodies
against the G1 epitope and the NP epitope may be of specific diagnostic value.
Furthermore, levels of G1-specific antibodies and antibodies to either NP or G2
may allow estimation of the time elapsed following initial infection.
