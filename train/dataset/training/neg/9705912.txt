Acute infection of CD4+ lymphoid cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) induces an increase in the intracellular concentration of potassium (K+).
Media containing reduced or elevated concentrations of K+ were used to
investigate the role of this ion in HIV-1 production and cytopathology.
Incubation of CD4+ lymphoblastoid cells acutely infected by HIV-1 (strain LAI) in
low K+ medium resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in HIV-1 production and
markedly diminished HIV-1 induced cytopathic effects (CPE) relative to cells
incubated in medium containing a normal K+ concentration (approximately 5 mM).
Incubation of HIV-1 infected cells in media containing elevated concentrations of
K+ medium. Cells mM) increased HIV-1 production by two- to fivefold over the
amount produced in cells incubated in normal K+ medium. Cells incubated in high
K+ media also displayed enhanced HIV-1-induced cytopathology. The decrease in
HIV-1 production by low K+ medium and increase by high K+ media could be a
accounted for by effects on HIV-1 reverse transcription. However, low K+ medium
inhibited HIV-1 protein synthesis and high K+ media increased HIV-1 protein
synthesis. These results suggest that the HIV-1-induced increase in intracellular
is required for efficient viral replication and to induce cytopathology.
