In recent years, the occurrence of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) has been noted in 
zucchini crops in Poland. Beside characteristic isolates, which displayed mosaics
and chlorosis on infected plants, new necrotic isolates have also been
identified. Here, we analysed the molecular variability of 27 isolates of CMV
collected from zucchini in various regions of the country. Sequence and
phylogenetic analysis based on the genes encoding the coat (CP) and movement (MP)
proteins revealed that the Polish isolates belong to two subgroups: IA and II,
with the prevalence of subgroup II. New recombinant variants with an IA-MP/II-CP 
pattern for RNA3 were also detected.
