Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes (FC) represent a unique cell type, sharing
features of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells. FC were shown to
specifically infiltrate the injured liver and participate in fibrogenesis.
Moreover, FC exert a variety of paracrine functions, thus possibly influencing
the disease progression. However, the overall contribution of FC to liver
fibrosis remains unclear. We aimed to study the effect of a specific FC
depletion, utilizing a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase
(HSV-TK)/Valganciclovir suicide gene strategy. Fibrosis was induced by oral
thioacetamide (TAA) administration in C57BL/6J mice. Hepatic hydroxyproline
content was assessed for the primary readout. The HSV-TK model enabled the
specific depletion of fibrocytes. Hepatic hydroxyproline content was
significantly reduced as a result of the fibrocyte ablation (-7.8%; 95% CI:
0.7-14.8%; p = 0.033), denoting a reduced deposition of fibrillar collagens.
Lower serum alanine transaminase levels (-20.9%; 95% CI: 0.4-36.9%; p = 0.049)
indicate a mitigation of liver-specific cellular damage. A detailed mode of
action, however, remains yet to be identified. The present study demonstrates a
relevant functional contribution of fibrocytes to chronic toxic liver fibrosis,
contradicting recent reports. Our results emphasize the need to thoroughly study 
the biology of fibrocytes in order to understand their importance for hepatic
fibrogenesis.
