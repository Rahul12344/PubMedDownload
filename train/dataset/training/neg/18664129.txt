lysis by natural killer cells].

The present work was aimed to examine whether the actin reorganization of
3T3-SV40 cells influences their sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cells
activity. The effects of N-acetylcystein (NAC) and latrunculin B, actin
depolimerizator, on both cellular parameters were studied. Experiments with NAC
demonstrated that 3T3-SV40 sensitivity to NK cells activity remained unchanged
under the disordered microfilaments but decreased upon the appearance of
structured stress-fibres. The data on latrunculin B action resulted in the
opposite conclusion: the more microfilaments disorganization in the presence of
latrunculin B the lesser 3T3-SV40 sensitivity to lysis by NK cells. These facts
suggest that relations between microfilament integrity in 3T3-SV40 cells and
their sensitivity to NK cells are rather independent. The latter confirms our
previous conclusion (Gamaley et al., 2006). Decrease in 3T3-SV40 sensitivity to
NK cells activity accompanied by actin reorganization resulted from both
latrunculin B and NAC action suggests changes in cellular surface, which
ultimately lead to inactivation (or loss) of the molecules being activating
signals to NK cells.
