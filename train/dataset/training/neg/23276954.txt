Matrix proteins are essential components of most negative-sense RNA, enveloped
viruses. They serve a wide range of duties ranging from self-driven membrane
budding and coordination of other viral components to modulation of viral
transcription. The functional similarity between these proteins is striking,
despite major differences in their structures. Whereas biochemical and structural
studies have partly been hindered by the inherent aggregation properties of these
proteins, their cellular functions are beginning to be understood. In this review
we summarize the current knowledge on negative-sense RNA virus matrix proteins
and their interactions with other viral and cellular proteins. We also discuss
the similarities and differences in matrix protein functions between the
different families within the negative-sense RNA viruses.
