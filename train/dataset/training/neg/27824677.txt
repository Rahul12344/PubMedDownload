BACKGROUND: HIV infection and biomarkers of inflammation [measured by
interleukin-6 (IL-6)], monocyte activation [soluble CD14 (sCD14)], and
coagulation (D-dimer) are associated with morbidity and mortality. We
hypothesized that these immunologic processes mediate (explain) some of the
excess risk of mortality among HIV infected (HIV+) versus uninfected people
independently of comorbid diseases.
METHODS: Among 2350 (1521 HIV+) participants from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study
Biomarker Cohort (VACS BC), we investigated whether the association between HIV
and mortality was altered by adjustment for IL-6, sCD14, and D-dimer, accounting 
for confounders. Participants were followed from date of blood draw for biomarker
assays (baseline) until death or July 25, 2013. Analyses included ordered
logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards regression.
RESULTS: During 6.9 years (median), 414 deaths occurred. The proportional odds of
being in a higher quartile of IL-6, sCD14, or D-dimer were 2-3 fold higher for
viremic HIV+ versus uninfected people. Mortality rates were higher among HIV+
compared with uninfected people [incidence rate ratio (95% CI): 1.31 (1.06 to
1.62)]. Mortality risk increased with increasing quartiles of IL-6, sCD14, and
D-dimer regardless of HIV status. Adjustment for IL-6, sCD14, and D-dimer
partially attenuated mortality risk among HIV+ people with unsuppressed viremia
(HIV-1 RNA ≥10,000 copies per milliliter) compared with uninfected people-hazard 
ratio (95% CI) decreased from 2.18 (1.60 to 2.99) to 2.00 (1.45 to 2.76).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection is associated with elevated IL-6, sCD14, and D-dimer, 
which are in turn associated with mortality. Baseline measures of these
biomarkers partially mediate excess mortality risk among HIV+ versus uninfected
people.
