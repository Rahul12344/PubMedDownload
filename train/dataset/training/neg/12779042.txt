Lymphoid hyperplasia of cervical lymph nodes is a common head and neck
presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Lymphoid
hyperplasia of HIV carrier presenting as nasopharyngeal tumor and neck mass is
rarely discussed. We reported a 30-year-old male patient who had left side neck
mass for 3 months. Nasopharyngeal cancer with neck metastasis was impressed due
to huge nasopharyngeal tumor and neck mass. The patient was then transferred to
our clinic for further evaluation. Physical examination revealed a 30 x 30 mm
mass over left jugulodigastric area and a 20 x 20 mm mass over left posterior
triangle of neck. Telescopic examination revealed a 20 x 20 mm bulging mass over 
nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal biopsy was done and histopathologic examination
revealed lymphoid hyperplasia. Laboratory survey showed seropositive of HIV
infection for both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot
tests.
