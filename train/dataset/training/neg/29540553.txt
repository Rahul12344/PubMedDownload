Hyperacetylation of tau has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive
decline in tauopathy brains. The nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent
class-III protein deacetylase SIRT1 is one of the major enzymes involved in
removal of acetyl groups from tau in vitro However, whether SIRT1 regulates
acetylation of pathogenic tau and ameliorates tau-mediated pathogenesis remains
unclear. Here, we report deacetylating activity of SIRT1 for acetylated Lys174
(K174) of tau in tauP301S transgenic mice with a brain-specific SIRT1 deletion.
We show that SIRT1 deficiency leads to exacerbation of premature mortality,
synapse loss, and behavioral disinhibition in tauP301S transgenic mice of both
sexes. By contrast, SIRT1 overexpression by stereotaxic delivery of
adeno-associated virus that encodes SIRT1 into the hippocampus reduces acetylated
K174 tau. Furthermore, SIRT1 overexpression significantly attenuates the spread
of tau pathology into anatomically connected brain regions of tauP301S transgenic
mice of both sexes. These findings suggest the functional importance of SIRT1 in 
regulating pathogenic tau acetylation and in suppressing the spread of tau
pathology in vivoSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In neurodegenerative disorders with
inclusions of microtubule-associated protein tau, aberrant lysine acetylation of 
tau plays critical roles in promoting tau accumulation and toxicity. Identifying 
strategies to deacetylate tau could interfere with disease progression; however, 
little is known about how pathogenic tau is deacetylated in vivo Here we show
that the protein deacetylase SIRT1 reduces tau acetylation in a mouse model of
neurodegeneration. SIRT1 deficiency in the brain aggravates synapse loss and
behavioral disinhibition, and SIRT1 overexpression ameliorates propagation of tau
pathology.
