Patients with HIV are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In this
study we investigated the effect of Nef, a secreted HIV protein responsible for
the impairment of cholesterol efflux, on the development of atherosclerosis in
two animal models. ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet and C57BL/6 mice fed a
high-fat, high-cholesterol diet were injected with recombinant Nef (40
ng/injection) or vehicle, and the effects of Nef on development of
atherosclerosis, inflammation, and dyslipidemia were assessed. In apoE(-/-) mice,
Nef significantly increased the size of atherosclerotic lesions and caused vessel
remodeling. Nef caused elevation of total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in 
the plasma while reducing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. These
changes were accompanied by a reduction of ABCA1 abundance in the liver, but not 
in the vessels. In C57BL/6 mice, Nef caused a significant number of lipid-laden
macrophages presented in adventitia of the vessels; these cells were absent from 
the vessels of control mice. Nef caused sharp elevations of plasma triglyceride
levels and body weight. Taken together, our findings suggest that Nef causes
dyslipidemia and accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages within the vessel
wall, supporting the role of Nef in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in
HIV-infected patients.-Cui, H. L., Ditiatkovski, M., Kesani, R., Bobryshev, Y.
