INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to investigate MRI and associated clinical
characteristics of brainstem encephalitis induced by enterovirus 71 (EV71) in
children with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD).
METHODS: We analyzed clinical and imaging data from 42 HFMD cases with
EV71-induced brainstem encephalitis. All patients underwent plain and enhanced
MRI cranial scans and were placed into one of two groups according to MRI
enhancement results, an enhanced group or a nonenhanced group.
RESULTS: Thirty-two cases were positive on MRI exam. The primary location of the 
lesion for brainstem encephalitis was the dorsal pons and medulla oblongata (32
cases), followed by the cerebellar dentate nucleus (8 cases), midbrain (5 cases),
and thalamus (2 cases). Plain T1-weighted images showed isointense or hypointense
signals, and T2-weighted images showed isointense and hyperintense signals.
Enhanced MRI scans showed that 12 cases had slight to moderate enhancement; 4 of 
these were normal on plain scan. The time from MRI examination to disease onset
was statistically different between the enhanced (n = 12) and nonenhanced
(n = 21) groups with a mean of 7.67 days (SD = 1.07) vs 11.95 days (SD = 5.33),
respectively. The most common neurological symptoms for brainstem encephalitis
were myoclonus and tremor. The greater the area of affected brain, the more
severe the clinical symptoms were.
CONCLUSION: The locations of EV71-induced HFMD-associated brainstem encephalitis 
lesions are relatively specific. Enhanced MRI scans could also identify the
lesions missed by early plain scans. MRI scans can provide important information 
for clinical evaluation and treatment.
