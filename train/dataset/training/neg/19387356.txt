INTRODUCTION: Advances in laboratory methods capable of detecting recent HIV
infection offer the promise of quickly and efficiently measuring HIV incidence in
cross-sectional surveys, thereby greatly expanding the capabilities of
surveillance programs. We compared HIV-1 incidence estimates derived from 3
different methods: Vironostika-less sensitive, BED capture enzyme immuno assay
(BED-CEIA), and repeat testing history.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using HIV testing data from the
population of all men who have sex with men presenting for serological HIV
voluntary counseling and testing at the largest testing programs in San Francisco
from 2000 to 2004 (n = 15,010). Specimens were evaluated for recent HIV-1
infection using Vironostika-LS and BED-CEIA. Concordance between the 2 assays was
assessed using the Kappa statistic.
RESULTS: The BED-CEIA and Vironostika-LS concurred in 90% of specimen
classifications (Kappa = 0.77; "good" strength of agreement). Predictors of
recent HIV-1 infection common to both methods were unprotected receptive anal
intercourse (P < 0.001), sex with a known HIV-positive partner (P < 0.001), and
amphetamine use (P < 0.01). Temporal trends in HIV-1 incidence were also
consistent and stable.
CONCLUSIONS: There was good concordance in the classification of recent HIV-1
infection between BED-CEIA and Vironostika-LS and in the correlates of
acquisition of infection. The findings suggest that these incidence assays can be
used for the basic epidemiological purposes of measuring HIV-1 incidence,
identifying populations at risk for infection, and tracking the leading edge of
the epidemic over time.
