Virus structures continue to be the basis for mechanistic virology and serve as a
paradigm for solutions to problems concerning macromolecular assembly and
function in general. The use of X-ray crystallography, electron cryomicroscopy
and computational and biochemical methods has provided not only details of the
structural folds of individual viral components, but also insights into the
structural basis of assembly, nucleic acid packaging, particle dynamics and
interactions with cellular molecules.
