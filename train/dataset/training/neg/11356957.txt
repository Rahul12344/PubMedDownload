We previously demonstrated that the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus
(FMDV) to form plaques in cell culture is associated with the suppression of
alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta). In the present study, we used Escherichia
coli-expressed porcine and bovine IFN-alpha or -beta individually to demonstrate 
that each was equally effective in inhibiting FMDV replication. The block in FMDV
replication appeared to be at the level of protein translation, suggesting a role
for double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). In support of these
findings, treatment of porcine and bovine cells with 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor 
of PKR, increased the yield of virus 8.8- and 11.2-fold, respectively, compared
to that in untreated infected cells. In addition, results of FMDV infection in
mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from gene knockout mice lacking the gene
for RNase L(-/-) or PKR(-/-) or both indicated an important role for PKR in the
inhibition of FMDV replication.
