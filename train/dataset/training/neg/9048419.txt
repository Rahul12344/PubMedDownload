Phase clones with affinity for polystyrene/polyurethane magnetic particles were
isolated from a 10-men peptide display library. Sequence analysis revealed that
40 out of 80 clones contained the consensus WXXWXXXW. Some of the selected phages
showed high surface activity and adsorbed to plastic surfaces even in the
presence of blocking agents or surfactants. Covalent attachment of a synthetic
peptide (KG), carrying one of the selected sequences to alkaline phosphatase (AP)
or bovine serum albumin (BSA) enhanced binding of AP to a wide range of materials
and improved the ability of BSA to prevent binding of antibodies and phages to
polystyrene. Interestingly, the WXXW/XXXW motif occurs in the beta- and
gamma-chains of the natural "adhesive" protein fibrinogen, and a synthetic
peptide carrying the gamma-chain 369-376 sequence turned out to have essentially 
the same binding properties as the KG peptide. Furthermore, adsorption in
different types of polystyrene was similar for AP carrying either the KG or
gamma-chain peptide intact fibrinogen and plasmin-generated fragment D1. The
latter fragment contains two copies of the WXXWXXXW motif but lacks the
alpha-chain: protuberances previously implicated in fibrinogen adsorption. Thus, 
our study may have revealed a hitherto unknown structural determinant for
fibrinogen's adsorptivity, located in the 13-kDa C terminal region of the
gamma-chain.
