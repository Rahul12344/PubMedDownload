The infection routes of HIV-1 can affect several viral properties, including
dissemination, pathogenesis, and immune evasion. In this study, we evaluated the 
inhibitory activity of a wide variety of anti-HIV drugs, focusing on the impact
that different infection pathways have on their efficacy. Compared to cell-free
infection, inhibitory activities were reduced in cell-to-cell productive
transmission for all drugs tested. We detected weak reporter-expressing target
cells after cell-to-cell transmission in the presence of integrase strand
transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Further analysis revealed that this expression was 
mainly due to unintegrated circular HIV (cHIV) DNAs, consisting of 1-LTR and
2-LTR circles. When in vitro-constructed cHIV DNAs were introduced into cells,
the production of infectious and intercellular transmittable virions was
observed, suggesting that cHIV DNA could be a source of infectious virus. These
results highlight some advantages of the cell-to-cell infection mode for viral
expansion, particularly in the presence of anti-retroviral drugs.
