detection.

Brazil, which is hyperendemic for dengue virus (DENV), has had recent Zika (ZIKV)
and (CHIKV) Chikungunya virus outbreaks. Since March 2016, CHIKV is the arbovirus
infection most frequently diagnosed in Rio de Janeiro. In the analysis of 1835
syndromic patients, screened by real time RT-PCR, 56.4% of the cases were
attributed to CHIKV, 29.6% to ZIKV, and 14.1% to DENV-4. Sequence analyses of
CHIKV from sixteen samples revealed that the East-Central-South-African (ECSA)
genotype of CHIKV has been circulating in Brazil since 2013 [95% bayesian
credible interval (BCI): 03/2012-10/2013], almost a year before it was detected
by arbovirus surveillance program. Brazilian cases are related to Central African
Republic sequences from 1980's. To the best of our knowledge, given the available
sequence published here and elsewhere, the ECSA genotype was likely introduced to
Rio de Janeiro early on 2014 (02/2014; BCI: 07/2013-08/2014) through a single
event, after primary circulation in the Bahia state at the Northestern Brazil in 
the previous year. The observation that the ECSA genotype of CHIKV was
circulating undetected underscores the need for improvements in molecular methods
for viral surveillance.
