OBJECTIVE: To identify 'B domain' mutations of polymerase gene and its
relationship with drug resistance during treatment with famciclovir in Chinese
chronic asymptomatic HBV carriers.
METHODS: Sequential sera from 29 Chinese chronic HBeAg positive HBV carriers
treated with combination therapy with thymosin alpha1 (Talpha1) plus famciclovir 
and also from 15 cases treated with Talpha1 alone, were studied. Nucleotide
sequences encoding 'B' and 'C domain' of the HBV polymerase gene were determined 
by direct or cloning sequencing methods.
RESULTS: Nine Talpha1 plus FCV-treated and none of the Talpha1 treated patients
developed mutations in the 'B domain' of polymerase gene which could result in
amino acid changes. The development of 'B domain' mutations, during treatment,
was significantly associated with HBV DNA rebound in those who received Talpha1
plus FCV.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in FCV-treated patients resulting in amino acid changes
mainly cluster in the 'B domain' of polymerase gene rather than in YMDD motif.
The presence of mutations is significantly associated with HBV DNA rebound during
treatment.
