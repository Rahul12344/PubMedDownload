Active HCV infection is associated with increased circulating levels of
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), soluble CD163 and
inflammatory monocytes regardless of liver fibrosis and HIV coinfection.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), 
soluble (s) CD163 and sCD14 play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCV and
HIV infection and are involved in inflammation and liver fibrosis. The aim of the
present study was to evaluate at a single time point, plasma soluble biomarkers
and inflammatory monocytes subsets in different groups of subjects: (i) HIV
monoinfected patients on suppressive ART; (ii) HIV/HCV coinfected patients on
ART, with undetectable HIV viremia (including either subjects who had active HCV 
replication or those who cleared HCV); (iii) HCV monoinfected individual with
active viral replication.
METHODS: Hundred and twenty-nine plasma samples were analyzed including HCV and
HIV monoinfected patients, HIV/HCV coinfected patients, with active HCV infection
(AHI) or with HCV viral clearance (VHC) and healthy donors (HD). Levels of IP-10,
sCD163 and sCD14 were measured by ELISA. Absolute cell counts of monocyte
subpopulations were enumerated in whole blood by using flow cytometric analyses.
RESULTS: IP-10 and sCD163 plasma levels were higher in HCV monoinfected and in
AHI coinfected pts compared to HIV monoinfected and HD, whereas sCD14 levels were
higher only in HIV monoinfected patients. Considering the degree of fibrosis,
sCD163 and sCD14 levels positively correlated with kPa values (as assessed by
fibroscan) and FIB-4 in HCV monoinfected group. On the other hand, IP-10 did not 
correlate with the fibrosis stage and it was found increased also in patients
with low fibrosis. Moreover, we found an increase of the inflammatory NCM subset,
in non-cirrhotic HCV subjects, while no alterations were observed in HIV, AHI and
VHC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a scenario in which active HCV infection is
associated with a strong pro-inflammatory state, even in the initial stage of
liver fibrosis, regardless the presence of HIV coinfection, thus underlying the
need of an early anti-HCV treatment.
