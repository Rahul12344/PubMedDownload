Pneumatosis of the gastrointestinal tract is defined as presence of air in the
wall of the gastrointestinal tract and can occur in any part of the
gastrointestinal tract. It is most commonly seen in the intestine and very rarely
in the esophagus. The exact pathogenesis is still unknown. It is managed
primarily by conservative and non-surgical therapy, unless there are findings to 
suggest an acute abdomen or other co-morbidities. On review of literature, very
few case reports of esophageal pneumatosis have been published. We present a rare
case of pneumatosis of the esophagus with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
