The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of dengue type 2 virus
(DV) and DV-induced cytokines (CF and CF2) on T lymphocyte subpopulations of
spleen by flow cytometry. Following DV-ic inoculation in mice the percent number 
of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the spleen was reduced, the peak reduction in
both was observed on the 6th day post-inoculation (p.i.). Intravenous inoculation
of CF or CF2 in mice also decreased the percent number of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T 
lymphocytes subpopulation in the spleen, the maximum reduction being observed at 
1 and 2 hr, respectively. The reduction in T lymphocyte subpopulation by CF and
CF2 was found to be dose dependent. Thus, the alterations of T lymphocyte
subpopulations during DV infection are mediated via cytokines.
