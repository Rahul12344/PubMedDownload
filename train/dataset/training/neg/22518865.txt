Rapid and broad diagnostic methods are needed for the identification of viral
agents of gastroenteritis. In this study, we used Luminex xMAP technology to
develop a multiplexed assay for the simultaneous identification of major enteric 
viral pathogens, including rotavirus A (RVA), noroviruses (NoVs) (including
genogroups GI and GII), sapoviruses (SaV), human astrovirus (HAstV), enteric
adenoviruses (EAds), and human bocavirus 2 (HBoV2). The analytical sensitivity
allowed detection of 10(3) (EAds, HBoV2, and RVA) and 10(4) (NoV GI and GII, SaV,
and HAstV) copies per reaction mixture. Compared to conventional PCR, the
Luminex-based assay yielded greater than 75% sensitivity and 97% specificity for 
each virus, and the kappa correlation for detection of all viruses ranged from
0.75 to 1.00. In conclusion, this multiplexed Luminex-based assay provides a
potentially rapid, high-throughput, and maneuverable diagnostic tool for major
viral pathogens associated with gastroenteritis.
