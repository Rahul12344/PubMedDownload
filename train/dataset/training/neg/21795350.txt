Longitudinal studies of T cell immune responses during viral infections in humans
are essential for our understanding of how effector T cell responses develop,
clear infection, and provide long-lasting immunity. Here, following an outbreak
of a Puumala hantavirus infection in the human population, we longitudinally
analyzed the primary CD8 T cell response in infected individuals from the first
onset of clinical symptoms until viral clearance. A vigorous CD8 T cell response 
was observed early following the onset of clinical symptoms, determined by the
presence of high numbers of Ki67(+)CD38(+)HLA-DR(+) effector CD8 T cells. This
response encompassed up to 50% of total blood CD8 T cells, and it subsequently
contracted in parallel with a decrease in viral load. Expression levels of
perforin and granzyme B were high throughout the initial T cell response and
likewise normalized following viral clearance. When monitoring regulatory
components, no induction of regulatory CD4 or CD8 T cells was observed in the
patients during the infection. However, CD8 as well as CD4 T cells exhibited a
distinct expression profile of inhibitory PD-1 and CTLA-4 molecules. The present 
results provide insight into the development of the T cell response in humans,
from the very onset of clinical symptoms following a viral infection to
resolution of the disease.
