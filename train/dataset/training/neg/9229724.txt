This study reports the seroprevalence of bovine viral infections in llamas (Lama 
glama) in Argentina. This is the first study made in the country including 390
llamas and testing antibodies against eight viruses. Samples were collected from 
nine farms distributed in three different provinces: Buenos Aires, Córdoba and
Jujuy. The samples were tested for antibodies against eight viruses known to
infect cattle: bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus
(BVDV), bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAdV III), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine
rotavirus (BRV), bluetongue virus (BTV), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), and
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The antibody prevalences detected in llamas 
were: BHV-1 in 0.7% of the samples (3/390), BVDV in 2.0% (8/390), BAdV III in
5.1% (20/390), BEV in 4.6% (18/390), BRV in 87.6% (342/390). No antibodies were
detected against BTV, BLV and VIAA (viral infection associated antigen) in any of
the analyzed camelids.
