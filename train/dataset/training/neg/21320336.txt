BACKGROUND: Twenty-nine Marek's disease virus (MDV) strains were isolated during 
a 3 year period (2007-2010) from vaccinated and infected chicken flocks in
Poland. These strains had caused severe clinical symptoms and lesions. In spite
of proper vaccination with mono- or bivalent vaccines against Marek's disease
(MD), the chickens developed symptoms of MD with paralysis.Because of this we
decided to investigate possible changes and mutations in the field strains that
could potentially increase their virulence. We supposed that such mutations may
have been caused by recombination with retroviruses of poultry - especially
reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV).
METHODS: In order to detect the possible reasons of recent changes in virulence
of MDV strains, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses for meq oncogene and for
long-terminal repeat (LTR) region of REV were conducted. The obtained PCR
products were sequenced and compared with other MDV and REV strains isolated
worldwide and accessible in the GeneBank database.
RESULTS: Sequencing of the meq oncogene showed a 68 basepair insertion and frame 
shift within 12 of 24 field strains. Interestingly, the analyses also showed
0.78, 0.8, 0.82, 1.6 kb and other random LTR-REV insertions into the MDV genome
in 28 of 29 of strains. These genetic inserts were present after passage in
chicken embryo kidney cells suggesting LTR integration into a non-functional
region of the MDV genome.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate the presence of a recombination between MDV and 
REV under field conditions in Polish chicken farms. The genetic changes within
the MDV genome may influence the virus replication and its features in vivo.
However, there is no evidence that meq alteration and REV insertions are related 
to the strains' virulence.
