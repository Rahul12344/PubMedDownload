The bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 transactivator protein is required for viral 
transcriptional regulation and DNA replication and may be important for long-term
episomal maintenance of viral genomes within replicating cells (M. Piirsoo, E.
Ustav, T. Mandel, A. Stenlund, and M. Ustav, EMBO J. 15:1-11, 1996). We have
evidence that, in contrast to most other transcriptional transactivators, the E2 
transactivator protein is associated with mitotic chromosomes in dividing cells. 
The shorter E2-TR and E8/E2 repressor proteins do not bind to mitotic chromatin, 
and the N-terminal transactivation domain of the E2 protein is necessary for the 
association. However, the DNA binding function of E2 is not required. We have
found that bovine papillomavirus type 1 genomes are also associated with mitotic 
chromosomes, and we propose a model in which E2-bound viral genomes are
transiently associated with cellular chromosomes during mitosis to ensure that
viral genomes are segregated to daughter cells in approximately equal numbers.
