Antigenic relationship between the surface antigens of avian and equine influenze
viruses.

Rott R, Becht H, Orlich.

Influenza virus Equine 1 (A/equine/Prague/56) has a hemagglutinin which is
antigenically related to the hemagglutinin of fowl plague virus strain Rostock
(FPV) and a neuraminidase which cross-reacts with the enzyme of virus N
(A/chick/Germany/49). After a single injection of chickens with Equine 1 virus no
hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) and neutralizing antibodies against FPV can be
demonstrated, although the birds are fully protected against a lethal dose of
FPV. HI and neutralizing antibodies against FPV appear after a second injection
of Equine 1 virus several weeks after the first one. Liberation of newly
sunthesized FPV from the host cell is ingibited by antibodies cross-reacting with
any antigen of virus surface.
