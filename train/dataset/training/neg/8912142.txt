BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis D virus superinfection in hepatitis B virus carriers
produces additional damage in an already injured liver. Earlier reports noted
that the development of hepatocellular carcinoma may be accelerated in hepatitis 
D virus-superinfected patients. This study aimed to investigate the impact of
hepatitis D virus on the clinical course of hepatitis B virus-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: A total of 42 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma cases seropositive
for antibody against hepatitis D virus antigen (anti-HDV) were found from 1986 to
1994; the clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes were compared with 255 
consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma cases seropositive for hepatitis B virus
surface antigen but seronegative for anti-HDV.
RESULTS: The mean age was 60 years in both groups of patients. Other features,
including sex, duration of follow-up, presence of cirrhosis or ascites, serum
biochemistry, status of HBV-e antigen, and gross and microscopic tumor
appearance, were not significantly different between the two groups. Though more 
patients in the anti-HDV-positive group underwent active treatment (operation or 
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) than those in the anti-HDV-negative
group (54.8% in 42 versus 34.9% in 255 cases, p = 0.02), the cumulative 4-year
survival rates (9.5% versus 9.8%) were similar. For the anti-HDV-positive
hepatocellular carcinoma patients, tumor size < 5 cm and active treatment were
favorable prognostic predictors associated with survival > 18 months.
CONCLUSION: Hepatitis D virus superinfection does not accelerate the development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical manifestations were similar, and the
outcome in anti-HDV-positive patients was not worse than in the general
HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma patients, as long as they were diagnosed 
at an early stage and actively treated.
