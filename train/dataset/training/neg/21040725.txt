BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several studies have reported hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA
sequences in the circulation after treatment-induced or spontaneous recovery. We 
investigated whether the HCV RNA represents persistence of HCV infection or
reinfection.
METHODS: We studied 117 patients who recovered from HCV infection (98 following
therapy and 19 spontaneously). A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
assay was used to detect the 5'-untranslated region of HCV. T-cell responses were
studied by enzyme-linked immunospot for interferon-γ.
RESULTS: Plasma samples from 15% of treatment-recovered patients and no
spontaneously recovered patient tested positive for HCV RNA. Lymphocytes from 3
patients who responded to therapy and 1 who recovered spontaneously tested
positive. The frequency of HCV RNA detection in plasma correlated inversely with 
the time after the end of treatment. Post-treatment HCV 5'-untranslated region
sequences matched pretreatment sequences in 85% of cases. T-cell responses were
significantly greater at time points with detectable trace amounts of HCV RNA
than at time points without detectable HCV RNA (P = .035) and were primarily
against nonstructural HCV antigens. The immune hierarchy was preserved over 5
years in patients whose post-treatment HCV RNA sequences matched pretreatment
sequences, indicating HCV RNA persistence. An altered immune hierarchy with
dominant immune responses, shifting from nonstructural to structural antigens,
was observed in a single patient whose post-treatment HCV genotype differed from 
that of the pretreatment genotype, indicating HCV reinfection.
CONCLUSIONS: Trace amounts of HCV RNA of pretreatment sequence persisted and
reappeared sporadically in the circulation within 8 years after recovery from
hepatitis C but not thereafter, indicating that patients are cured of HCV
infection. Reappearance of HCV RNA induced HCV-specific T-cell responses.
