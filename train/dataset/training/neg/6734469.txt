Chronic hepatitis. Aetiology and current management.

Cooksley WG, Bradbear RA, Halliday JW, Powell LW.

The entity of chronic hepatitis has long been an enigma, and its treatment
confusing. Recent studies have indicated the importance of excluding causes such 
as drugs, Wilson's disease and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. After excluding
such causes, there are 3 major groups--'autoimmune', hepatitis B, and non-A,
non-B (NANB) in all of which an immunological basis for pathogenesis exists. The 
autoimmune group has been subdivided into a milder type (chronic persistent
hepatitis) and a more severe type (chronic active hepatitis) on histological
grounds. Corticosteroids are indicated in chronic active hepatitis if cirrhosis
or bridging necrosis is present. However, corticosteroids are contraindicated in 
disease due to the hepatitis B virus where chronic active hepatitis correlates
with the presence of replicating virus (serum positive for e antigen, DNA
polymerase and HBV-DNA), and in such cases antiviral agents and immunomodulation 
are being studied. Very little is known about NANB hepatitis in the absence of an
assay and there may be more than a single agent. In hepatitis B, the development 
of serological markers, molecular probes (HBV-DNA), natural animal hepatitis with
near-identical viruses, and delta antigen (a virus requiring co-infection with
hepatitis B) have all extended our knowledge so dramatically that it is hoped
that the enigma of chronic hepatitis will be solved when an assay for NANB
hepatitis becomes available.
