OBJECTIVE: To measure intravaginal practices among women of differing ages,
ethnicities, and human immunodeficiency virus status and the association between 
intravaginal practices and bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis infection.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, we recruited and followed sexually active women
aged 18-65 years living in Los Angeles. At the enrollment and month 12 visit,
participants completed a self-administered, computer-assisted questionnaire
covering demographics, sexual behaviors, vaginal symptoms, and intravaginal
practices over the past month. At each visit, bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis
infection were diagnosed by Nugent criteria and DNA probe, respectively.
RESULTS: We enrolled 141 women. Two thirds (66%) reported an intravaginal
practice over the past month; 49% reported insertion of an intravaginal product
(other than tampons) and 45% reported intravaginal washing. The most commonly
reported practices included insertion of commercial sexual lubricants (70%),
petroleum jelly (17%), and oils (13%). In univariable analysis, intravaginal use 
of oils was associated with Candida species colonization (44.4% compared with 5%,
P<.01). In multivariable analysis, women reporting intravaginal use of petroleum 
jelly over the past month were 2.2 times more likely to test positive for
bacterial vaginosis (adjusted relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval
1.3-3.9).
CONCLUSION: Intravaginal insertion of over-the-counter products is common among
women in the United States and is associated with increased risk of bacterial
vaginosis. The context, motivations for, and effects of intravaginal products and
practices on vaginal health are of concern and warrant further study.
