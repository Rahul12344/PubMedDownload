Apolipoprotein J/clusterin is an enigmatic protein highly regulated in
inflammation, apoptosis, and cancer. Despite extensive studies, its biological
function has remained obscure. Here we show that apolipoprotein J inhibits
neuroblastoma cell invasion. Since this function can be regulated by NF-kappaB,
we explored the possibility that apolipoprotein J might interfere with NF-kappaB 
signaling. Ectopic apolipoprotein J expression strongly inhibited NF-kappaB
activity in human neuroblastoma cells and murine embryonic fibroblasts by
stabilizing inhibitors of NF-kappaB (IkappaBs). Steady state levels of IkappaB
proteins are drastically reduced in mouse embryo fibroblasts after disruption of 
the apolipoprotein J gene. Absence of apolipoprotein J causes reduction of
IkappaB stability, a tumor necrosis factor-dependent increase in NF-kappaB
activity, increased transcription of the NF-kappaB target gene c-IAP and
down-modulation of p53 protein. These results suggest that an unexpected
physiological role of apolipoprotein J is to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling through 
stabilization of IkappaBs and that this activity may result in suppression of
tumor cell motility.
