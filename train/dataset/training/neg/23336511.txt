In this report, the anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity of
dehydrocheilanthifoline (DHCH), a quaternary ammonium alkaloid isolated from the 
traditional Chinese medicine Corydalis saxicola Bunting (Papaveraceae), was
determined in vitro. Following six days of treatment, DHCH efficiently suppressed
the secretions of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2.2.15 cell cultures, with a
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 15.84 and 17.12 μM, and with a 
therapeutic index (TI) of 7.32 and 6.77, respectively. Further studies revealed
that DHCH reduced the levels of extracellular DNA, intracellular DNA and
covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of HBV in a dose-dependent and
time-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 15.08, 7.62 and 8.25 μM,
respectively after six days of treatment. In contrast, the level of viral
pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) increased 6.13-fold after treatment with DHCH. Together, 
it was demonstrated for the first time that DHCH could significantly inhibit the 
replication of HBV, which warrants further studies on the antiviral mechanisms of
DHCH, and suggests that it may be a promising candidate in the therapy of HBV
infection.
