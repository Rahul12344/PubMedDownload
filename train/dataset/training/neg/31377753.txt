BACKGROUND: The role of antiviral prophylaxis to prevent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
viremia or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in pediatric solid organ
transplant recipients is controversial. We examined whether valganciclovir (VAL) 
prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus infection was associated with EBV viremia
following transplantation in EBV-naive children.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was conducted of EBV-naive
pediatric heart and renal transplant recipients with an EBV-positive donor from
January 1996 to April 2017. VAL was tested for association with EBV viremia-free 
survival in the first 6 months posttransplantation when immunosuppressant
exposure is the highest. Survival models evaluated VAL duration, with adjustment 
for other baseline confounders.
RESULTS: Among the cohort (n = 44), 3 (6.8%) were heart transplants, 25 (56.8%)
received VAL, and 22 (50%) developed EBV viremia in the first-year
posttransplantation. Mean time-to-viremia was 143 vs. 90 days for the VAL and
no-VAL groups, respectively (p = 0.008), in the first 6 months. Only two patients
developed viremia while on VAL. Each additional day of VAL was associated with
1.4% increase in viremia-free survival (p < 0.001). Multivariable modeling of VAL
with other baseline risk factors did not identify other independent risk factors.
CONCLUSION: VAL is independently associated with delayed onset of EBV viremia,
with prolongation of delay with each additional day of antiviral prophylaxis.
