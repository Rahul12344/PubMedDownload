4-Azido, 4-amino, 4-amido and 4-alkoxy compounds related to the lignans
podophyllotoxin and 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin have been synthesized, and
their structures elucidated. The Ritter reaction was shown to be useful in the
preparation of the 4-amido compounds with the required stereochemistry. A
preparative method for 4-chloro-4-deoxypicrophyllotoxin, for which all earlier
synthetic attempts resulted in the two dehydrated compounds, alpha- and
beta-apopicropodophyllotoxin, was developed. Supplementary preliminary studies of
the biological activities of some of the compounds were performed. All compounds 
had pronounced inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of human cervical cancer 
cells and TC-mouse cells with 4-amino-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin and
4-azido-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin showing the highest activity. Alkaline elution
studies indicate that the toxicity of the 4'-demethoxy derivatives is due to
protein-mediated DNA nicking. None of the compounds were found to have antiviral 
effect against herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency (HIV), and
cytomegalovirus (CMV) in doses not toxic to the cells.
