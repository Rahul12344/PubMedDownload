BACKGROUND: Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) has proven valuable for
studies of the pathogenesis of malignant lymphoma. Inoculation of newborn mice
induces T cell lymphoma with 100% incidence. The TLL (T cell
lymphoma/leukemia)-strain was previously established and was shown to
spontaneously develop T cell lymphoma at high frequency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differential screening of cDNA libraries was performed to 
discover an involvement of Mo-MLV and genomic sequencing was used to identify the
chromosomal position of Mo-ML V proviral integration sites. Immunophenotypes of
the tumors were established by flow cytometty. Disease frequency curves were
created according to the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Two independent Mo-MLV germ line integrations were characterized on
chromosomes 2 and 14, giving rise to two substrains of mice denoted TLL-2 and
TLL-14. The chromosomal position of the integrated provirus affected the
frequency of disease, as well as the immunophenotype of the tumors.
CONCLUSION: The data suggest that factors influencing the transcriptional
activity of the chromosomal regions, leading to differences in proviral
expression, could underlie the observed difference in tumor frequency.
