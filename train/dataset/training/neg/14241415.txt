TUMOR AND VIRUS ANTIGENS OF SIMIAN VIRUS 40: DIFFERENTIAL INHIBITION OF SYNTHESIS
BY CYTOSINE ARABINOSIDE.

RAPP F, MELNICK JL, KITAHARA T.

Cells infected with the papovavirus SV40 not only synthesize viral antigen but
also synthesize the specific nonviral antigen found in SV40-induced tumors. In
the presence of the DNA antagonist cytosine arabinoside, infected cells fail to
make viral antigen but still synthesize the tumor antigen. Iododeoxyuridine does 
not inhibit the synthesis either of tumor or of virus antigen but does prevent
the development of infectious virus.
