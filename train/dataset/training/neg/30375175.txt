We report the detection of Moku virus in honey bees (Apis mellifera) collected in
2017 from hives with a history of attacks by invasive Asian hornets (Vespa
velutina nigrithorax) in Belgium. End 2016, Moku virus was reported in Asian
hornets from the same area. In addition, the Moku virus was already present in
historical samples of bees collected in 2013, that is, 2 years after the official
first detection of Asian hornets in the same area of Belgium. This study suggests
a spread of Moku virus to honey bees with possible consequences.
