Genomic organization of the simian virus 40-adenovirus 7 hybrid virus, PARA(cT), 
that encodes a nuclear transport defective simian virus 40 T antigen.

Lanford RE, Jacob JR, Butel JS.

The genomic organization of the simian virus 40 (SV40)-adenovirus (Ad)7 hybrid
virus, PARA(cT), was examined. A deletion of approximately 5529 bp of Ad7 DNA
extends from 78.8 map units to 94.0 map units and is replaced by an SV40 DNA
insert of 3809 bp. The left-hand end of the insertion begins at SV40 nucleotide
5168, 5 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon for T-ag synthesis. The sequence 
extends counterclockwise through the T-ag encoding sequences and into SV40 late
region DNA. Most of the late region DNA has been removed in a deletion between
nucleotides 2464 and 301. One of the 72-bp repeats has also been deleted. The
right-hand end of the SV40 DNA insert is at nucleotide 4366. Thus, a portion of
the SV40 DNA early region is repeated at both ends of the insert (nucleotides
5168-4366).
