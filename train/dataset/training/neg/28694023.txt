Recent studies suggest that several bacterial species are involved in tumor
immunosurveillance and antitumor immunity. The role of bacteria in immune
responses in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is still
unknown. In this study, we examined the bacteria-reactive CD8+ T cell response in
patients with HBV-related HCC. We found that circulating CD8+ T cells from
healthy individuals demonstrated minimal or zero specificity toward a series of
commensals and bacteria previously associated with antitumor effects, including
Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium longum, Bacteroides
fragilis, and Enterococcus hirae. In contrast, the circulating CD8+ T cells from 
HBV-related HCC patients presented significantly elevated bacteria-reactive
responses, albeit with high variations among different HCC individuals.
Reactivity toward bacteria was also identified in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T
cells. These bacteria-reactive responses were not primarily induced by TLR
ligand, but were dependent on the presence of antigen-presenting monocytes, and
were MHC class I-restricted. Interestingly, we observed that the CD8+ T
cell-to-Foxp3+ regulatory T cell ratio was positively correlated with the
proportions of Bifidobacterium longum-reactive and Enterococcus hirae-reactive
CD8+ T cells, while the frequency of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells was negatively correlated
with the frequency of Enterococcus hirae-reactive CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the 
disease-free survival time of HCC patients after tumor resection was positively
correlated with the frequencies of Bifidobacterium longum-reactive and
Enterococcus hirae-reactive CD8+ T cells. Together, these results suggested that 
certain bacterial species might present valuable antitumor effects.
