Polymorphisms in the coding sequences of CCR5 and CXCR4 were studied in a group
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected long-term nonprogressors. Two
different point mutations were found in the CXCR4 coding sequence. One of these
CXCR4 mutations was silent, and each was unique to two nonprogressors. The
well-described 32-bp deletion within the CCR5 coding sequence (CCR5-Delta32) was 
found in 4 of 13 nonprogressors, and 12 different point mutations were found
scattered over the CCR5 coding sequence from 8 nonprogressors. Most of the
mutations created either silent or conservative changes in the predicted amino
acid sequence: only one of these mutations was found in more than a single
nonprogressor. All nonsilent mutations were tested in an HIV envelope-dependent
fusion assay, and all functioned comparably to wild-type controls. Polymorphisms 
in the CXCR4 and CCR5 coding sequences other than CCR5-Delta32 do not appear to
play a dominant mechanistic role in nonprogression among HIV-infected
individuals.
