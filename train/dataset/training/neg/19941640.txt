Although the risk of a herpes B virus (Cercopithecine herpes virus 1) infection
is low, the clinical course of the infectious disease is generally unfavourable. 
A high safety standard can be achieved if people with professional contact to
primates apply proper organisational, technical and personal safety precautions. 
The risk can be considerably reduced if animal keepers, laboratory assistants and
scientists receive adequate information about the pathology of herpes B virus and
are well trained in the necessary procedures and the precautions. For this
reason, comprehensive and regular training, information and instruction must be
provided to all primate workers and to laboratory workers who come into contact
with potentially infectious material. After potential contamination, the risk for
the affected worker must be assessed immediately and post-exposure
chemoprophylaxis performed if necessary. This necessitates internal risk
assessment. An interdisciplinary group of experts has developed an action plan
for Germany.
