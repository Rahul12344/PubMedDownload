The cellular changes during ageing are incompletely understood yet immune system 
dysfunction is implicated in the age-related decline in health. The acquired
immune system shows a functional decline in ability to respond to new pathogens
whereas serum levels of cytokines are elevated with age. Despite these
age-associated increases in circulating cytokines, the function of aged
macrophages is decreased. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors such as
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are vital in the response of macrophages to
pathological stimuli. Here we review the evidence for defective TLR signalling in
normal ageing. Gene transcription, protein expression and cell surface expression
of members of the TLR family of receptors and co-effector molecules do not show a
consistent age-dependent change across model systems. However, there is evidence 
for impaired downstream signalling events, including inhibition of positive and
activation of negative modulators of TLR induced signalling events. In this paper
we hypothesize that despite a poor inflammatory response via TLR activation, the 
ineffective clearance of pathogens by macrophages increases the duration of their
activation and contributes to perpetuation of inflammatory responses and ageing.
