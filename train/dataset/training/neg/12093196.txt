Oesophageal endoscopy in cattle has been rarely reported in the literature. It
has, however, been used for many years as an aid to the diagnosis and treatment
of illnesses of the upper gastrointestinal tract in small animals and horses. We 
have assessed the potential value of oesophagoscopy on 120 bovine patients
presented at the 2nd Medical Clinic for Ruminants and Swine at the University of 
Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, over a period of three years. In the course of the
study, cattle exhibiting symptoms such as salivation, regurgitation or swelling
in the neck region were referred for endoscopic examination. The main indication 
was to confirm or exclude bovine virus diarrhoea virus infection in calves, in
which typical erosions were visible endoscopically on the mucosa of the
oesophagus in infected animals. In addition, endoscopy proved to be useful for
the diagnosis of diverticula, ruptures and inflammation of the oesophagus.
Oesophagoscopy can be considered to be a valuable supplementary aid to clinical
examination and, in many cases, can facilitate diagnosis.
