Increased detections and severe neonatal disease associated with coxsackievirus
B1 infection--United States, 2007.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Enteroviruses generally cause mild disease; however, neonates are at higher risk 
for severe illness because of the immaturity of their immune systems. Neonatal
systemic enterovirus disease, characterized by multiorgan involvement, is among
the most serious, potentially fatal conditions associated with enterovirus
infection. Typical clinical presentations include encephalomyocarditis
(characteristic of group B coxsackieviruses) and hemorrhage-hepatitis syndrome
(typical of echovirus 11). To describe the severity of neonatal illness
associated with coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) infection, CDC analyzed case reports and
preliminary data from the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) for
2007. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that,
in 2007, CVB1 for the first time was the predominant enterovirus in the United
States, accounting for 113 (25%) of 444 enterovirus infections with known
serotypes. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the 2007 CVB1 strains suggested 
that the cases resulted from widespread circulation of a single genetic lineage. 
Health-care providers and public health departments should be vigilant to the
possibility of neonatal disease caused by CVB1. Testing for enteroviruses in
clinically compatible cases and reporting of identified enteroviruses to NESS
should be encouraged.
