Construction and expression in vivo of an internally deleted mouse
alpha-fetoprotein gene: presence of a transcribed Alu-like repeat within the
first intervening sequence.

Young PR, Scott RW, Hamer DH, Tilghman SM.

An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 'minigene' was constructed by joining the first two
exons along with 0.9 kilobases of 5' flanking sequence of the mouse AFP gene to
its last exon and 0.4 kilobases of 3' flanking sequence. This 'minigene' was
tested for activity by inserting it into an SV40 vector and infecting African
green monkey kidney cells. Correct initiation, termination, polyadenylation and
splicing were observed. Furthermore a 220 nucleotide transcript was detected and 
mapped to a mouse Alu-like or B1 repeat on the opposite strand to that encoding
the AFP gene in the first intervening sequence.
