Population and poverty in Africa.

Desai M.

"This paper sets out the position in Sub-Saharan Africa...regarding poverty and
population. Africa has as much danger of starvation and depopulation [due to
AIDS] as of over population. The paper sets out a model of poverty based on the
twin concepts of capabilities and entitlements. This is [a] micro level approach 
and points to the importance of health and education as well as physical assets
in analysing poverty. Issues of gender are always kept central. Income, access to
public goods, physical assets and human capital are the four determinants of the 
status of any individual visavis poverty."
