Mature viroids consist of a noncoding, covalently closed circular RNA that is
able to autonomously infect respective host plants. Thus, they must utilize
proteins of the host for most biological functions such as replication,
processing, transport, and pathogenesis. Therefore, viroids can be regarded as
minimal parasites of the host machinery. They have to present to the host
machinery the appropriate signals based on either their sequence or their
structure. Here, we summarize such sequence and structural features critical for 
the biological functions of viroids.
