Our previous study proved that the N-terminal (aa693-711) of glycoprotein E2
contained sequential neutralizing epitopes. In this study, four candidate
epitope-vaccines (EVs) were separately prepared and evaluated. Among them,
epitope-vaccine EV-BC1a (BC1a: aa693-699) induced high level of epitope-specific 
neutralizing antibodies and exhibited similar protective capability with that
induced by Chinese vaccine strain (C-strain). These results confirmed CKEDYRY
(aa693-699) as a principal sequential neutralizing epitope on E2 N-terminal.
Moreover, these findings also indicate that epitope-vaccine is a potent candidate
strategy for marker vaccine against classical swine fever virus (CSFV).
