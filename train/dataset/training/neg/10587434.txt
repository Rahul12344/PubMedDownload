Papillomaviral E2 proteins participate in viral DNA replication and
transcriptional regulation. We have solved the solution structure of the
DNA-binding domain of the E2 protein from bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1). The
structure calculation used 2222 distance and 158 dihedral angle restraints for
the homodimer (202 residues in total), which were derived from homonuclear and
heteronuclear multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic
data. The root-mean-square deviation for structured regions of the monomer when
superimposed to the average is 0.73 +/- 0.10 A for backbone atoms and 1.42 +/-
0.16 A for heavy atoms. The 101 residue construct used in this study (residues
310-410) is about 4.5 kcal/mol more stable than a minimal domain comprising the
C-terminal 85 amino acid residues (residues 326-410). The structure of the core
domain contained within BPV-1 E2 is similar to the corresponding regions of other
papilloma viral E2 proteins. Here, however, the extra N-terminal 16 residues form
a flap that covers a cavity at the dimer interface and play a role in DNA
binding. Interactions between residues in the N-terminal extension and the core
domain correlate with the greater stability of the longer form of the protein
relative to the minimal domain.
