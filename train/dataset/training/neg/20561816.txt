BACKGROUND: The interpretation of a positive IgM antibody result to human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in a pregnant woman is of major importance for the correct
management of the pregnancy. Determination of HCMV-specific IgG avidity is
considered an useful approach for distinguishing IgM antibody due to primary HCMV
infection from IgM antibody elicited during non-primary infection.
OBJECTIVE: Comparative evaluation of eight commercial HCMV IgG avidity assays
currently available in Europe.
STUDY DESIGN: A panel of 198 sequential samples collected from 65 pregnant women 
at 0-90, 91-180, and >180 days after the onset of primary HCMV infection was
retrospectively tested by Abbott, BioMÃ©rieux, Bio-Rad, DiaSorin, Diesse,
Euroimmun, Radim, and Technogenetics HCMV IgG avidity assays according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
RESULTS: None of the 198 samples tested yielded identical scores by the kits
under evaluation. The Euroimmun and Radim assays showed the best correlation with
expected results in terms of low (0-90 days), intermediate (90-180 days) and high
(>180 days) avidity results, respectively. The best accuracy in diagnosing a
recent (<90 days after the onset) or non-recent (>180 days after the onset)
primary HCMV infection was shown by Radim followed by Euroimmun and Diesse. The
best correlation with a well established in-house developed HCMV IgG avidity
assay was shown by Radim.
CONCLUSIONS: HCMV IgG avidity kits need to be improved and standardized. In the
meantime, highly specific IgM assays are preferable for screening purposes in
pregnant women.
