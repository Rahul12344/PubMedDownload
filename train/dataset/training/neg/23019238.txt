BACKGROUND: Smoking has been associated with cervical cancer. We examined whether
smoking increases the risk for high-grade cervical lesions in women with
high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
METHODS: In a population-based cohort study, 8,656 women underwent a structured
interview, and subsequently cervical cells were obtained for HPV DNA testing.
Women with high-risk HPV infection and no prevalent cervical disease at baseline 
(n = 1,353) were followed through the Pathology Data Bank for cervical lesions
for up to 13 years. Separate analyses of women with persistent high-risk HPV
infection (n = 312) were also conducted. HRs for a diagnosis of cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse/high-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions or worse (CIN3+) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated in the two groups.
RESULTS: Among high-risk HPV-positive women, an increased risk for CIN3+ was
associated with long-term smoking (≥10 years) and heavy smoking (≥20
cigarettes/d). In the subgroup of women with persistent HPV infection, heavy
smoking was also associated with a statistically significantly higher risk for
CIN3+ than never smoking (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.05-3.22, adjusted for length of
schooling, parity, and HPV type at baseline). The average number of cervical
cytology screening tests per year during follow-up did not explain the
differences in risk in relation to smoking (P = 0.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with an increased risk for subsequent
high-grade cervical lesions in women with persistent high-risk HPV infection.
IMPACT: Our study adds to the understanding of the role of smoking in the natural
history of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis.
