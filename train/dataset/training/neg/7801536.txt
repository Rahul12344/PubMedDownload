In 1990 an epidemic caused by a morbillivirus was noticed among Mediterranean
dolphins. RNA was extracted from the tissues of dolphins and from cell cultures
infected with a corresponding dolphin morbillivirus isolate. By nucleic acid
hybridization this RNA was compared to RNA extracted from animal tissue or cell
cultures infected with canine distemper virus (CDV), phocine distemper virus
(PDV) or measles virus (MV). The presence of morbillivirus RNA in the dolphin
tissue was demonstrated. Morbillivirus N, P, M and F gene mRNAs were detected in 
the RNA from dolphin morbillivirus infected cells. These mRNA species seemed to
be of approximately the same size as the corresponding mRNA species of CDV, PDV
and MV. The results of the comparison demonstrated that the dolphin morbillivirus
is genetically different from CDV, PDV and MV. No indication of a close
relationship between the dolphin isolate and either CDV, PDV or MV was found.
