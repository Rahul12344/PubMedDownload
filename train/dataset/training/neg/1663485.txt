OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anal intercourse is a risk factor for anal HPV
infection in women.
DESIGN: Results derived from clinical examination, anal cytology and HPV DNA
hybridisation were correlated with data obtained from a questionnaire
administered to the patients at the time of their clinical examination.
SETTING: A sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in Sydney, Australia.
SUBJECTS: 31 women attending the clinic for HPV related problems.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A thorough history was elicited from each woman followed by 
physical examination of the anogenital region. Cervical and anal scrapes were
collected for cytology and HPV DNA hybridisation. Of the 15 women who practised
anal intercourse, a total of 12 (80%) had either clinical or subclinical HPV
infection. Seven had overt anal warts, situated either internally or externally
in the anal canal; and further 5 women had evidence of subclinical HPV infection 
as determined by positive cytological and/or HPV DNA hybridisation results on
their anal scrapes. The women who did not have a history of anal intercourse had 
a lower (7/16, 43%), but not statistically significant, rate of anal HPV
infection: five had anal warts and two had subclinical evidence of infection. No 
correlations were found between anal HPV infection and genital (cervical, vulval 
or vaginal) HPV infection; nor between the HPV typing patterns of women in either
group.
CONCLUSION: The results obtained from these women do not indicate a close
relationship between anal intercourse and the presence of detectable anal HPV
infection.
