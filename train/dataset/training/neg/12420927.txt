A new method for the study of pathogen transport in porous media is presented.
The method is based on conjugation of fluorescent dyes to target bacteriophages
and application of the modified bacteriophages for tracer studies. We demonstrate
that the relevant transport determining properties of Rhodamine and several
fluorescein-labeled phages are practically identical to those of the native
bacteriophages. The advantages of the proposed method relative to direct
enumeration of bacteriophages by plaque forming unit method, turbidity,
fluorescent microspheres, and other alternative tracers are discussed. Notable
advantages include simple quantitation by optical methods, unbiased signals even 
when virus aggregates are formed, and the ability to decouple inactivation
kinetics from transport phenomena. Additionally, the signal reflects the removal 
and transport of the studied microorganism and not a surrogate.
