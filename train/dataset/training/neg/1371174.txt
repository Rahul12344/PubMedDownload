A novel, sequence-independent strategy has been developed for the amplification
of full-length cDNA copies of the genes of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses.
Using human (Bristol) group C rotavirus as an example, a single amino-linked
modified oligonucleotide (primer 1) was ligated to either end of each dsRNA
genome segment by using T4 RNA ligase. Following reverse transcription,
annealing, and repair of cDNA strands, amplification of the viral dsRNA genome
was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using a single complementary
oligonucleotide (primer 2). Northern (RNA) hybridization of cDNA to virus dsRNA
indicated that it was possible to generate cDNA representing the complete genome 
from very small clinical samples. This technique was used to determine the
complete nucleotide sequence (728 bp) and coding assignment of gene 10, which
revealed an open reading frame of 212 amino acids with limited homology to NS26
from human group A rotavirus. In contrast to previous tailing methods, the
addition of one defined primer allowed unequivocal identification of terminal
nucleotides and should be generally applicable to viruses with segmented dsRNA
genomes and especially for analysis of clinical samples, for which very limited
quantities of biological material are available.
