In the spring of 2006, four human cases of parapoxvirus infections in Missouri
residents were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
two of which were initially diagnosed as cutaneous anthrax. This investigation
was conducted to determine the level of recognition of zoonotic parapoxvirus
infections and prevention measures, the degree to which veterinarians may be
consulted on human infections and what forces were behind this perceived increase
in reported infections. Interviews were conducted and clinical and environmental 
sampling was performed. Swab and scab specimens were analyzed by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas serum specimens were evaluated for
parapoxvirus antibodies. Three case patients were found to have fed ill juvenile 
animals without using gloves. Forty-six percent of veterinarians reported having 
been consulted regarding suspected human orf infections. Orf virus DNA was
detected from five of 25 asymptomatic sheep. Analysis of extracellular envelope
gene sequences indicated that sheep and goat isolates clustered in a
species-preferential fashion. Parapoxvirus infections are common in Missouri
ruminants and their handlers. Infected persons often do not seek medical care;
some may seek advice from veterinarians rather than physicians. The initial
perception of increased incidence in Missouri may have arisen from a reporting
artifact stemming from heightened concern about anthrax. Asymptomatic
parapoxvirus infections in livestock may be common and further investigation
warranted.
