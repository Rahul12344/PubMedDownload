BACKGROUND: Worldwide, healthcare workers (HCWs) show different levels of
response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine. One of the factors associated with
vaccine unresponsiveness may be the existence of current or past HBV infection.
Regardless of the presence of HBsAg (overt infection), occult HBV infection (OBI,
defined as presence of HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg) might also account for
some non- or hypo-response cases.
METHODS: Sera from 120 HBsAg-negative HCWs with low and moderate levels of
anti-HBs, <10 IU/mL (group I) and <100 IU/mL (group II) respectively, were
selected and were examined for OBI by sensitive real-time PCR regardless of HBV
serological profiles. Direct sequencing on surface genes was carried out in
OBI-positive cases.
RESULTS: Four (3.3%) were positive for OBI. All were negative for anti-HBc. Two
of the positive cases had moderate levels of anti-HBs (>10 to <100 IU/mL). No
significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of risk
factors or serological data. No mutations were found in surface proteins of OBI
cases.
CONCLUSION: OBI in these subjects might be due to other factors rather than
presence of "a" determinant mutations. Healthcare workers with inadequate to
moderate levels of anti-HBs (<100 IU/mL) following vaccination, regardless of
their serological profile for HBV, should be tested for the presence of HBV DNA
by sensitive molecular tests. Anti-HBc is not a reliable marker for suspicion of 
OBI, especially in high-risk group individuals.
