Anaplastic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an uncommon histologic phenotype of Kaposi's
and one that is typically associated with a locally aggressive clinical course.
We report a case of a 53-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-positive male, on 
highly active antiretroviral therapy 1 month prior to admission, who presented
with fever, cough, respiratory distress, multiple skin lesions and cervical and
inguinal lymphadenopathy not responding to multiple antibiotics. Microscopic
examination of punch biopsies from the forehead and chest revealed a spindled
cell neoplasm with marked cytologic atypia and scattered mitoses, features
consistent with a diagnosis of anaplastic KS and confirmed by
immunohistochemistry with HHV-8. Biopsy of an involved lymph node also revealed
involvement by KS. Despite aggressive clinical treatment, the patient rapidly
deteriorated and expired 1 week after the diagnosis of anaplastic KS was
rendered. Our case underscores the aggressive clinical course of this uncommon
histologic variant of KS and its recalcitrant clinical behavior.
