Short repeats cause heterogeneity at genomic terminus of bovine herpesvirus 1.

Hammerschmidt W, Ludwig H, Buhk HJ.

Analysis of the genomes of different bovine herpesvirus 1 strains revealed a UL
terminal HindIII fragment differing in size (from 2.4 to 2.8 kilobases). This
fragment polymorphism occurred in the DNA of a wild-type isolate, in highly
passaged, apathogenic tissue culture derivatives, and in plaque-purified
substrains. This heterogeneity was due to variations in the copy number of a
14-base-pair tandem repeat comprising the base sequence 5'-GCTCCTCCTCCCTC-3',
which also exists, with some differences, in other short reiteration sequences of
herpes simplex virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, and related human cellular DNA. 
Furthermore, the tandem repeat array was located in close proximity to the left
end of the viral genome and may functionally be involved in viral replication.
