Genotyping of human rotaviruses was performed in 191 rotavirus-positive fecal
samples collected from infants with acute gastroenteritis, 3 years after the
introduction of two rotavirus vaccines in South Korea. Among these samples, the
most prevalent rotavirus genotype was G3P[8] (30.9%), followed by G1P[8] (27.7%),
G4P[6] (15.2%), and G9P[8] (5.8%). Sequence analysis identified RotaTeq®
vaccine-derived strains in 12 samples (6.3%), comprising 11 G1P[8] human-bovine
double reassortant rotaviruses and 1 G1P[5] human-bovine single reassortant
rotavirus. It is of note that cross-reactivity between the current G4-specific
typing primer and RotaTeq®-specific G1 genotypes was found. A trace of the
clinical and environmental routes of the rotavirus vaccine strains revealed
unexpected complexity, and the diagnostic protocol for rotaviruses may require
modification by using either another typing primer set or nucleotide sequence
analysis.
