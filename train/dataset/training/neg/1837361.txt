Fifty-two patients at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection who had one or several epileptic seizures in the course of that disease
were retrospectively studied from 1985 to 1990. Thirty-five percent of these
patients were in overt clinical AIDS at the time of the seizure(s). AIDS was
revealed by a seizure in 2 cases. Generalized seizures were observed in 71
percent of the patients, and partial seizures in 29 percent.
Electroencephalograms showed signs of brain irritation in only 19 percent of the 
cases. The cause of epileptic seizure(s) could be determined in 36 patients:
cerebral toxoplasmosis in 23 cases; progressive multifocal leucoencephalitis in 2
cases; HIV encephalopathy in 3 cases; iatrogenic cause in 4 cases;
meningoencephalitis in 3 cases and neurosyphilis in 1 case. No cause other than
HIV infection was found in 16 patients. These findings confirm those of previous 
studies. In about one-third of AIDS patients epileptic seizures are the only
clinical manifestation of viral central nervous system infection.
