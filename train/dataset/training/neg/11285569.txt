EBV serological tests have been used for many years as accessory diagnostic
predictors of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To increase the sensitivity and
specificity of the NPC detection rate, a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was established using a bacterially-expressed GST-EBNA-1 protein,
containing the EBNA-1 sequence cloned from an NPC patient. Serum samples were
collected from age- and gender-matched patients with NPC, community control
subjects and hospital control patients and tested using this ELISA. The
positivity rates were 78.7% (247/314) in NPC, 11.5% (28/244) in hospital controls
and 3.8% (10/263) in the community control group. These serum samples were also
tested for IgA anti-VCA antibodies and their ability to neutralize EBV DNase and 
the sensitivities of the anti-VCA antibody and DNase-neutralization tests also
were analyzed. The optimum combination is VCA plus EBNA-1, which can identify
92.5% (287/310) of NPC patients, and shows a specificity of 92.7% (242/261) for
normal individuals.
