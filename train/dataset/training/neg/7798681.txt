Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is associated with the development of secondary
immunosuppression with resultant bacterial and fungal superinfections. Because
class II HLA expression within the lung may be important in normal pulmonary
cell-mediated immunity, the association of CMV infection of alveolar epithelial
cells (AEC) with an absence of HLA class II antigens was tested. Using
dual-labeling immunohistochemistry to detect CMV, AEC, endothelial cells,
macrophages, and HLA class II antigens, lung tissue from patients whom died with 
CMV pneumonia was examined. Seventy-five percent of infected cells were AEC. In
contrast to adjacent noninfected AEC, which expressed HLA-DR antigens, 91% of
infected AEC were negative. There was no difference in this expression pattern
between patients with or without AIDS. The absence of HLA class II antigens on
infected AEC may account, in part, for the secondary immunosuppression associated
with CMV pneumonia.
