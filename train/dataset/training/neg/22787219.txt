versus antagonist activity.

CCR5 is the major HIV-1 entry coreceptor. RANTES/CCL5 analogs are more potent
inhibitors of infection than native chemokines; one class activates and
internalizes CCR5, one neither activates nor internalizes, and a third partially 
internalizes without activation. Here we show that mutations in CCR5
transmembrane domains differentially impact the activity of these three inhibitor
classes, suggesting that the transmembrane region of CCR5, a key interaction site
for inhibitors, is a sensitive molecular switch, modulating receptor activity.
