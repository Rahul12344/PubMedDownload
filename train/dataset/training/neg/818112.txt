Use of phage F-phi WJ-1 of Mycobacterium fortuitum to discern more phage types of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Jones WD Jr, Greenberg J.

A total of 125 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the Southeastern area
of the United States was subjected to phage typing. In addition to the five major
mycobacteriophages, a new phage, F-phi WJ-1, was used in the study. The results
obtained with the five major phages were: type A0, 35.2%; TYPE B, 29.6%, and type
C, 4.0%. The remaining 21.2% of the strains phaged typed as subgroups A1 through 
A6. These percentages were similar to the typing results of earlier studies. The 
new phage, F-phi WJ-1, subdivided each of the phage types, with the exception of 
type C, into two subgroups. The possible role of host modification-restriction of
the phages used in phage typing of strains of M. tuberculosis is discussed.
