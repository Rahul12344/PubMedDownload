Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been identified as a worldwide agent of serious 
upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. HMPV 
is second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a leading cause of
bronchiolitis, and, like RSV, consists of two major genotypes that cocirculate
and vary among communities year to year. Children who have experienced acute HMPV
infection may develop sequelae of wheezing and asthma; however, the features
contributing to this pathology remain unknown. A possible mechanism for
postbronchiolitis disease is that HMPV might persist in the lung providing a
stimulus that could contribute to wheezing and asthma. Using immunohistochemistry
to identify HMPV-infected cells in the lungs of mice, we show that HMPV mediates 
biphasic replication in respiratory epithelial cells then infection migrates to
neuronal processes that innervate the lungs where the virus persists with no
detectable infection in epithelial cells. After glucocorticoid treatment, the
virus is reactivated from neural fibers and reinfects epithelial cells. The
findings show that HMPV persists in neural fibers and suggest a mechanism for
disease chronicity that has important implications for HMPV disease intervention 
strategies.
