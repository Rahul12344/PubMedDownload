Disulfiram, which exhibits marked tumor inhibition mediated by copper, was
encapsulated in lipid nanocapsules modified with TAT peptide (TATp) and
pH-triggered sheddable PEG to target cancer cells on the basis of tumor
environmental specificity. PEG-shedding lipid nanocapsules (S-LNCs) were
fabricated from LNCs by decorating short PEG chains with TATp (HS-PEG(1k)-TATp)
to form TATp-LNCs and then covered by pH-sensitive graft copolymers of long PEG
chains (PGA-g-PEG(2k)). The DSF-S-LNCs had sizes in the range of 60-90 nm and
were stable in the presence of 50% plasma. DSF-S-LNCs exhibited higher
intracellular uptake and antitumor activity at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4. The
preincubation of Cu showed that the DSF cytotoxicity was based on the
accumulation of Cu in Hep G2 cells. Pharmacokinetic studies showed the markedly
improved pharmacokinetic profiles of DSF-S-LNCs (AUC= 3921.391 μg/L·h, t(1/2z) = 
1.294 h) compared with free DSF (AUC = 907.724 μg/L·h, t(1/2z) = 0.252 h). The in
vivo distribution of S-LNCs was investigated using Cy5.5 as a fluorescent probe. 
In tumor-bearing mice, the delivery efficiency of S-LNCs was found to be 496.5%
higher than that of free Cy5.5 and 74.5% higher than that of LNCs in tumors. In
conclusion, DSF-S-LNCs increased both the stability and tumor internalization and
further increased the cytotoxicity because of the higher copper content.
