Type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has become increasingly prevalent
worldwide, and currently the ratio of type 2 to type 1 strains in the USA
approaches 50%. Although there is cross-reactivity between BVDV type 1 and type 2
strains, BVDV1 vaccine strains poorly protect from type 2 infection, so vaccines 
against BVDV should contain antigens from both BVDV types. Previously we
demonstrated efficacy of a BVDV1 E2 DNA vaccine, and in this study we optimized a
BVDV2 E2 DNA vaccine. Furthermore, as an approach to vaccinate with a DNA vaccine
against both BVDV types, we compared two strategies, mixing of plasmids encoding 
type 1 and type 2 E2, and co-expression of type 1 and type 2 E2 from one plasmid 
with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). An evaluation of the
IRES-containing plasmids demonstrated that the C-terminally expressed protein is 
produced at lower levels and induces weaker immune responses than the
N-terminally expressed protein, regardless of the position of the type 1 and type
2 E2 genes. In contrast, when both plasmids encoding type 1 and type 2 E2 were
administered to mice, the immune responses were similar to those induced by the
individual plasmids. Thus, a mixture of plasmids encoding type 1 and type 2 E2
could be a potential DNA vaccine candidate against both BVDV1 and BVDV2.
