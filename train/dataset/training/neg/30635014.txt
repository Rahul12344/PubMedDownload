BACKGROUND: Gene transfer to malignant sites using human adenoviruses (hAds) has 
been limited because of their immunogenic nature and host specificity. Murine
cells often lack some of the receptors needed for hAds attachment, thus murine
cells are generally non-permissive for human adenoviral infection and
replication, which limits translational studies.
METHODS: We have developed a gene transfer method that uses a combination of
lipid-encapsulated perfluorocarbon microbubbles and ultrasound to protect and
deliver hAds to a target tissue, bypassing the requirement of specific receptors.
RESULTS: In an in vitro model, we showed that murine TRAMP-C2 and human DU145
prostate cancer cells display a comparable expression pattern of receptors
involved in hAds adhesion and internalization. We also demonstrated that murine
and human cells showed a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells
transduced by hAd-GFP (green fluorescent protein) after 24 h and that GFP
transgene was efficiently expressed at 48 and 72 h post-transduction. To assess
if our image-guided delivery system could effectively protect the hAds from the
immune system in vivo, we injected healthy immunocompetent mice (C57BL/6) or mice
bearing a syngeneic prostate tumor (TRAMP-C2) with hAd-GFP/MB complexes. Notably,
we did not observe activation of innate (TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines), or adaptive
immune response (neutralizing antibodies, INF-γ+ CD8+ T cells).
CONCLUSIONS: This study brings us a step closer to demonstrating the feasibility 
of murine cancer models to investigate the clinical translation of image guided
site-specific adenoviral gene therapy mediated by ultrasound-targeted microbubble
destruction.
