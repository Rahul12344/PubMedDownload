Epicutaneous application of a contact sensitizer 2, 4-dinitro-1-chlorobenzene
(DNCB) is known to cause an inflammatory response and a hapten-specific T cell
activation. We developed a highly stable gel formulation for DNCB which is easy
to apply to the skin. The present study focused on whether topical application of
DNCB gel produced immunomodulation with prophylactic effects against lethal
herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) type 1. Our results indicated that topical
treatment with DNCB gel induced proliferation of lymph node cells, T cells as
well as antigen presenting cells, the production of cytokines, especially
IFN-gamma, and cutaneous inflammatory response comparable to that from freshly
prepared DNCB in olive oil. Repeated topical treatment of DNCB gel resulted in
prophylactic effect against lethal infection with herpes simplex virus type 1
(HSV-1). In mice repeatedly treated with DNCB gel and infected with HSV, a
significant increase in serum IFN-gamma was observed. These results suggest that 
topical DNCB functions as a potent immunomodulator, activating anti-viral defense
mechanisms.
