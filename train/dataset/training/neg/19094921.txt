African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is an orbivirus that is usually transmitted
between its equid hosts by adult Culicoides midges. In this article, we review
the ways in which AHSV may have adapted to this mode of transmission. The AHSV
particle can be modified by the pH or proteolytic enzymes of its immediate
environment, altering its ability to infect different cell types. The degree of
pathogenesis in the host and vector may also represent adaptations maximising the
likelihood of successful vectorial transmission. However, speculation upon
several adaptations for vectorial transmission is based upon research on related 
viruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV), and further direct studies of AHSV are
required in order to improve our understanding of this important virus.
