African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent of a contagious and
often lethal viral disease of domestic pigs. There are no vaccines to control
Africa swine fever (ASF). Experimental vaccines have been developed using
genetically modified live attenuated ASFVs obtained by specifically deleting
virus genes involved in virulence, including the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. TK
has been shown to be involved in the virulence of several viruses, including
ASFV. Here we report the construction of a recombinant virus (ASFV-G/V-ΔTK)
obtained by deleting the TK gene in a virulent strain of ASFV Georgia adapted to 
replicate in Vero cells (ASFV-G/VP30). ASFV-G/P-ΔTK demonstrated decreased
replication both in primary swine macrophage cell cultures and in Vero cells
compared with ASFV-G/VP30. In vivo, intramuscular administration of up to 10(6)
TCID50 of ASFV-G/V-ΔTK does not result in ASF disease. However, these animals are
not protected when challenged with the virulent parental Georgia strain.
