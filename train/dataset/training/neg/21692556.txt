Coxsackievirus group B and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a major receptor for the 
adenovirus groups that has drawn overall attention over the past decade. Although
this protein could potentially be used as an agent for the blocking of adenovirus
infection, large-scale production of highly purified human CAR in eukaryotic
expression system has not been reported. In the present study, we showed the
construction of recombinant baculovirus highly-expressing the extracellular
domain of human coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (exCAR) in High Five insect
cells. The recombinant exCAR was recovered from the cell culture medium as a
secreted soluble protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The
final yield of recombinant exCAR was about 8-10 mg/l of supernatant with the
purity of 96.3%. Binding activity assay showed that the recombinant exCAR
exhibited an intact ability of binding to the knob domain of the adenovirus type 
5 fiber protein (Ad fiber knob) displayed by T7 phage. These results showed that 
the recombinant human exCAR produced in insect cells and purified by Ni-NTA
chromatography retained its ability to bind to the Ad fiber knob and could
potentially be used in therapy of adenovirus infection.
