BACKGROUND: According to recent reports, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
induces bronchopneumonitis (BPn) in immunocompetent patients undergoing prolonged
mechanical ventilation (MV), whose respiratory functions deteriorate with a poor 
outcome. HSV-1 BPn is associated with HSV symptomatic or symptomless reactivation
in the oropharynx.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to systematically and genetically characterize HSV-1
strains isolated from immunocompetent patients receiving prolonged MV and to
characterize the genetic relationship of strains sequentially isolated from
oropharyngeal samples (OPS) and broncho-alveolar liquids (BAL) to determine the
natural course of HSV BPn.
STUDY DESIGN: In this molecular epidemiological study, microsatellite technology 
was used to determine genetic relationships between 211 HSV-1 strains isolated
from OPS and/or BAL from 106 patients receiving MV.
RESULTS: Microsatellite haplotypes of HSV-1 strains sequentially isolated from
the same individual were identical, and HSV-1 isolates from the lung were
genetically indistinguishable from strains isolated from the oral cavity. Each
patient was characterized by their own HSV-1 microsatellite haplotype, and no
nosocomial transmission of strains between patients was observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that, in patients who receive MV, the HSV-1
pulmonary infection results from the reactivation of genetically related HSV-1 in
the oropharynx, which progressively infects the lower respiratory tract.
