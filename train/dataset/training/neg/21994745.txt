Human T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2) present very
similar genomic structures but HTLV-1 is more pathogenic than HTLV-2. Is this
difference due to their transactivating Tax proteins, Tax-1 and Tax-2, which are 
responsible for viral and cellular gene activation? Do Tax-1 and Tax-2 differ in 
their cellular localization and in their interaction pattern with cellular
factors? In this review, we summarize Tax-1 and Tax-2 structural and phenotypic
properties, their interaction with factors involved in signal transduction and
their localization-related behavior within the cell. Special attention will be
given to the distinctions between Tax-1 and Tax-2 that likely play an important
role in their transactivation activity.
