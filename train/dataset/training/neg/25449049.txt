Arthritogenic alphaviral infection begins as a febrile illness and often
progresses to joint pain and rheumatic symptoms that are described as
polyarthritis. Alphaviral arthritis and classical arthritides share many similar 
cellular and immune mediators involved in their pathogenesis. Recent in vitro and
in vivo evidence suggests that bone loss resulting from increased expression of
bone resorption mediators may accompany alphaviral infection. In addition,
several longitudinal studies have reported more severe and delayed recovery of
alphaviral disease in patients with pre-existing arthritic conditions. This
review aims to provide insights into alphavirus-induced bone loss and focuses on 
aspects of disease exacerbation in patients with underlying arthritis and on
possible therapeutic targets.
