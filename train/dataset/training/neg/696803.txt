An ultrastructural study of acinic cell carcinomas of the canine pancreas.

Banner BF, Alroy J, Pauli BU, Carpenter JL.

Four cases of spontaneous adenocarcinoma of the canine exocrine pancreas were
studied by thin section and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The neoplastic
cells in all 4 cases were of acinar origin and showed many alterations of
cytoarchitecture compared with normal acinar cells. In the neoplastic cells,
zymogen granules varied in number and appearance and contained an abnormal
secretory product characterized by 24-nm-thick microtubules. The nuclear volume
and surface area and the nuclear cytoplasmic ratio were increased; although the
nuclear pore density per nuclear surface area was significantly decreased, there 
was no change in the nuclear pore density per nuclear volume. There was a
decrease in number and size of gap junctions; focal proliferation, fragmentation,
and discontinuation of the tight junctions were also noted. The basal lamina (BL)
of the neoplastic cells was discontinuous. The tumor microvasculature often
appeared as sinusoids and had sparse discontinuous BL. Finally, the endothelium
in both tumor and normal tissue contained "tubulo-reticular inclusions" (TRI)
which simulated distemper virus and were located in the rough endoplasmic
reticulum (RER) and the perinuclear cisternae.
