Serotyping of cell culture-adapted subgroup 2 human rotavirus strains by
neutralization.

Nine human rotavirus strains from stools of infants with gastroenteritis were
serially propagated in MA-104 cell cultures. All strains were identified as
subgroup 2 rotaviruses by RNA gel electrophoresis, complement fixation, and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The human rotavirus strains were propagated
for 15 to 20 passages and then used for immunization of guinea pigs and rabbits. 
Animal antisera were also raised against a subgroup 1 human strain purified from 
stools and against the cell culture-adapted Wa strain, a reference subgroup 2
rotavirus of human origin. Cross-neutralization studies revealed the existence of
two distinct serotypes within the cell culture-adapted subgroup 2 human
rotaviruses: strains related and unrelated to strain Wa were classified as
serotypes 1 and 3, respectively. Results with convalescent-phase sera from
infants with primary rotavirus infections confirmed the existence of two
serotypes within subgroup 2, and the serotypes responsible for primary subgroup 2
infections could be determined on the basis of the neutralizing reactivity of
convalescent sera.
