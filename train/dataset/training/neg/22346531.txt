A case of disseminated infection due to Nocardia otitidiscaviarum is described in
a Caucasian man infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The patient
presented with no previous AIDS-defining conditions, a CD4 lymphocyte count of
206 cells/mm(3) and enlarging intra-abdominal and chest wall abscesses with
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Aggressive surgical debridement and
antimicrobial therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and amikacin resulted in
clinical cure. Long term suppressive therapy was needed to prevent relapse.
