Human adenoviruses belong to the Adenoviridae family and they are divided into
seven species, including 56 types. Adenoviruses are common opportunistic
pathogens that are rarely associated with clinical symptoms in immunocompetent
patients. However, they are emerging pathogens causing morbidity and mortality in
recipients of hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplants, HIV infected
patients and patients with primary immune deficiencies. Clinical presentation
ranges from asymptomatic viraemia to respiratory and gastrointestinal disease,
haemorrhagic cystitis and severe disseminated illness. There is currently no
formally approved therapy for the treatment of adenovirus infections. This
article presents current knowledge about adenoviruses, their pathogenicity and
information about available methods to diagnose and treat adenoviral infections.
