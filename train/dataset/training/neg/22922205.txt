The influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen with a negative-sense, segmented
RNA genome. Construction of recombinant influenza viruses in the laboratory was
reported starting in the 1980s. Within a short period of time, pioneer
researchers had devised methods that made it possible to construct influenza
viral vectors from cDNA plasmid systems. Herein, we discuss the evolution of
influenza virus reverse genetics, from helper virus-dependent systems, to helper 
virus-independent 17-plasmid systems, and all the way to 3- and 1- plasmid
systems. Successes in the modification of different gene segments for various
applications, including vaccine and gene therapies are highlighted.
