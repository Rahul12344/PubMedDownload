The resistance of Streptococcus bovis strain II/1, the producer of SbvI
restriction endonuclease, to F4 phage infection was demonstrated by the
double-agar-layer method. Despite the presence of restriction endonuclease SbvI
which can cleave F4 phage DNA to numerous fragments in vitro, the evidence that
adsorption inhibition is the most important defence mechanism in phage resistance
of S. bovis II/1 strain was obtained by adhesion experiments in vivo. Electron
microscopy of phage-host mixtures showed many phage particles on the bacterial
surface of phage-sensitive S. bovis 47/3 control strain in comparison with no
phage particles seen on S. bovis II/1 (phage-resistant) strain surface.
