Lichenoid drug reaction following influenza vaccination in an HIV-positive
patient: a case report and literature review.

de Golian EW, Brennan CB, Davis LS.

Lichenoid drug reactions to vaccinations are rare but well-documented events. The
vast majority of these reported reactions have been triggered by Hepatitis B
vaccination (HBV). We describe an impressive generalized lichenoid drug reaction 
following the influenza vaccination. A 46-year-old African-American woman with a 
history of treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease developed a
diffuse, pruritic rash one day following vaccination against the influenza virus.
Physical exam and histopathology were consistent with a lichenoid drug eruption. 
This is only the fifth reported case of lichenoid drug reaction, and only the
second generalized case, following influenza vaccination. The patient's
underlying HIV disease, known to be a risk factor for both cutaneous drug
reactions and more severe manifestations of lichen planus, likely predisposed her
to this generalized hypersensitivity phenomenon.
