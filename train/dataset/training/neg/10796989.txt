Both chicken egg-white avidin and its bacterial relative streptavidin are well
known for their extraordinary high affinity with biotin (Kd approximately 10(-15)
M). They are widely used as tools in a number of affinity-based separations, in
diagnostic assays and in a variety of other applications. These methods have
collectively become known as (strept)avidin-biotin technology. Biotin can easily 
and effectively be attached to different molecules, termed binders and probes,
without destroying their biological activity. The exceptional stability of the
avidin-biotin complex and the wide range of commercially available reagents
explain the popularity of this system. In order by genetic engineering to modify 
the unwanted properties of avidin and to further expand the existing
avidin-biotin technology, production systems for recombinant avidin and
avidin-fusion proteins have been established. This review article presents an
overview of the current status of these systems. Future trends in the production 
and applications of recombinant avidin and avidin-fusion proteins are also
discussed.
