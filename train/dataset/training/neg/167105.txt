Fate of parental simian virus 40 DNA in permissive monkey kidney cells.

Howe CC, Tan KB, Sokol F.

The fate of parental SV40 DNA in monkey kidney cells was investigated by
infecting the cells with purified virus labelled with [3-H]-thymidine.
5-Bromodeoxyuridine (200 mug/ml) was added to the cells at 2 h after infection to
label virus progeny DNA. At 72 h post-infection the cells were harvested and
virus DNA was extracted and fractionated by isopycnic sedimentation in CsCL
solution. The following DNAs with characteristic densities were found: light
(LL), 1.70 g/ml; hybrid (HL), 1-75 g/ml and heavy DNA (HH), 1-80 g/ml. Of the
total cell-associated [3-H]-radioactivity (derived from parental virus), more
than 90% was recovered in unreplicated parental DNA(LL DNA), about 2% was
recovered in the HL DNA and about 1-7% was associated with the HH DNA. The
unreplicated parental DNA was present as uncoated intact DNA complexed with
proteins present in the infected cell. The HL DNA contains one light parental and
one heavy progeny DNA strand. The nature of the radioactivity present in the HH
DNA remains to be determined.
