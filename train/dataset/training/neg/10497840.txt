A method to infect mosquitoes with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and to
demonstrate virus transmission after an extrinsic incubation period is described.
Using per oral feeding method infection rate as high as 90% could be achieved.
Demonstration of transmission of the virus was achieved by allowing the infected 
mosquitoes to probe a suitable serum medium and testing the probed serum for
virus. Both infection and transmission were demonstrated by using
insect-bioassay.
