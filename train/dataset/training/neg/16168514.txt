BACKGROUND/AIMS: The interferon (IFN) inducible MxA protein is endowed with
antiviral activity against a broad range of RNA viruses. In a previous in vitro
study, we demonstrated that MxA inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication,
arguing that the antiviral activity of MxA is not restricted to RNA viruses but
also includes a DNA virus. The aim of the present study was to further
demonstrate in vivo the antiviral action of MxA against HBV.
METHODS: We generated HBV and HBV/MxA transgenic mice lacking a functional
IFN-alpha/beta receptor and thus constituting a good model to evaluate
MxA-induced virus resistance. HBV proteins expression, viral load and HBV
replication were compared in HBV and HBV/MxA mice.
RESULTS: An MxA-dependent moderate inhibitory effect on HBV expression was only
observed in female HBV/MxA mice, in which MxA downregulates (i) viral HBeAg and
capsid protein expression, (ii) viremia and (iii) HBV replication by decreasing
the synthesis of HBV DNA replicative intermediates. Furthermore, these effects
were not associated with changes to steady-state levels of HBV RNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in vivo, MxA is able per se to reduce HBV
expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism, and thus participates in the
antiviral activity of IFN-alpha against HBV.
