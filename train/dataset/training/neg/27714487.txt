Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family. It is usually
transmitted by mosquito bite. There have been no reports of severe symptoms
caused by ZIKV infection up until the last few years. In October 2013 an outbreak
was reported in French Polynesia with severe neurological complications in some
affected cases. In November 2015, the Ministry of Health of Brazil attributed the
increased number of neonatal microcephaly cases in northeastern Brazil to
congenital ZIKV infection. The rapid spread of the virus convinced the World
Health Organization to announce ZIKV infection as a "Public Health Emergency of
International Concern" in February 2016. The main neuroimaging findings in
congenital ZIKV infection include microcephaly which is the hallmark of the
disease, other malformations of cortical development (e.g., lissencephaly,
heterotopia, etc.), parenchymal calcifications, unilateral or bilateral
ventriculomegaly, enlarged extra-axial CSF spaces, dysgenesis of the corpus
callosum, agenesis of the cavum septum pellucidum, cerebellar and brainstem
hypoplasia, and ocular abnormalities. ZIKV infection may also cause
Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in adults.
Familiarity with neuroimaging findings of congenital and acquired ZIKV infection 
is crucial to suspect this disease in residents of endemic regions and travelers 
to these areas.
