The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is the receptor for several chemokines and major
co-receptor for X4 human immunodeficiency virus type-1 strains entry into cell. A
three-dimensional model of human CXCR4 was developed by homology modeling using
the high-resolution bovine rhodopsin structure as template. Interactions between 
CXCR4 and flavonoids were investigated using in silico docking studies. The
results underscore the potential of these compounds that they may become
important new antiviral drugs to combat AIDS. It is worth mentioning also that
apart from these existing flavonoids, there are many new compounds that may also 
be useful as topical agents to inactivate virus, or may act as adjuvants with
other antiviral drugs.
