The S gene encoding the major surface polypeptide of hepatitis B virus is
preceded by the region pre-S(2) with a capacity to code for 55 amino acid
residues. In the product of region pre-S(2), the sequence of 19 amino acid
residues (amino acids 14-32 from the N terminus) representing an area of high
local hydrophilicity is shared by viral strains of subtypes adr, ayw, and ayr;
residue 22, phenylalanine, is replaced by leucine in a strain of the other
subtype, adw. A synthetic peptide vaccine involving these 19 amino acid residues,
when given to two chimpanzees, raised antibodies that bound to viral particles
and protected the animals from challenge with 10(6) chimpanzee infectious doses
of hepatitis B virus.
