Lack of SOS repair in Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Gasc AM, Sicard N, Claverys JP, Sicard AM.

Wild-type strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were non-mutable by UV radiation
and thymidine starvation. Moreover, UV-irradiated pneumococcal omega 2 phages
were not reactivated in an irradiated host. This suggests that, in pneumoococcus,
there is no efficient inducible repair process similar to the SOS repair
described in detail for E. coli. We also report that mutations cannot be induced 
by a process thought to be linked to competence during transformation with
isogenic wild-type DNA either on wild-type strains or in strains in which the hex
function of excision and repair of mismatched bases is inactive.
