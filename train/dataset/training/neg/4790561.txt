Effect of isoprinosine against influenza and some other viruses causing
respiratory diseases.

Muldoon RL, Mezny L, Jackson GG.

The antiviral activity of isoprinosine was tested in tissue cultures and mice. In
tissue cultures, concentrations of 25 to 100 mug/ml inhibited the infectivity of 
influenza and herpes hominis viruses but not parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, or 
adenovirus. Among different strains of influenza A, there was considerable
variability in the inhibitory concentration of isoprinosine. For influenza B, a
zone effect was observed in the inhibitory drug concentration. Oral prophylactic 
administration of isoprinosine beginning 24 hr before infection with an
intermediate challenge dose of influenza A and continued as treatment for 5 days 
produced a significant reduction in mortality. No protection was provided against
a high dose challenge. Oral or intraperitoneal treatment of mice beginning 24 hr 
after infection with influenza A or B viruses significantly delayed or prevented 
death when the drug was administered for 10 days, but not when treatment was
limited to 4 days. An increased fatality rate which occurred in treated mice
given a virus dose of low lethality could not be attributed to drug toxicity.
