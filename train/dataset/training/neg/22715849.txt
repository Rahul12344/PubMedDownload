Individuals with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at higher
risk of developing adverse drug reactions. Multiple drugs are usually prescribed 
to patients with HIV infection for preventing the replication of HIV and for the 
treatment of the associated opportunistic infections. We report here the first
case of an HIV-1-infected patient who developed an exfoliative dermatitis induced
by efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Physicians should
be aware of the possible occurrence of efavirenz-induced skin eruptions from the 
start of antiviral treatment of HIV infection.
