The filoviruses, Ebola and Marburg, utilize a multifaceted mechanism for assembly
and budding of infectious virions from mammalian cells. Growing evidence not only
demonstrates the importance of multiple viral proteins for efficient assembly and
budding, but also the exploitation of various host proteins/pathways by the virus
during this late stage of filovirus replication, including endocytic
compartments, vacuolar protein sorting pathways, ubiquitination machinery, lipid 
rafts and cytoskeletal components. Continued elucidation of these complex and
orchestrated virus-host interactions will provide a fundamental understanding of 
the molecular mechanisms of filovirus assembly/budding and ultimately lead to the
development of novel viral- and/or host-oriented therapeutics to inhibit
filovirus egress and spread. This article will focus on the most recent studies
on host interactions and modulation of filovirus budding and summarize the key
findings from these investigations.
