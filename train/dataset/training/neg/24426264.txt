The present study reports the effect of WSSV on the expression profiles of shrimp
ubiquitin gene both at protein and transcript levels at different time points
after infection. A gradual decrease in ubiquitin protein levels was observed till
12 hpi (0.25 and 0.23 μg/mg of the total protein in gills and muscle,
respectively) with a sudden increase at 18 hpi (1.86 and 1.8 μg/mg of total
protein in gills and muscle, respectively). The RT-PCR results showed a gradual
decrease in ubiquitin mRNA levels in gill tissue till 12 hpi while a more or less
constant mRNA levels were observed in muscle tissue till 12 hpi. However, a
fourfold and 16 fold induction in ubiquitin mRNA levels at 18 hpi in gill and
muscle, respectively suggests its possible regulation by WSSV in the
manifestation of the disease.
