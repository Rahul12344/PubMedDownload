ELISA was used to determine PR la protein and TMV accumulation in local necrotic 
lesions produced on salicylic acid and water sprayed Nicotiana tabacum cv
Xanthi-nc leaves. The amount of PR la protein produced is the result of an
interaction between the salicylic acid treatment and lesion growth. The
implication of these observations for experiments investigating the relationship 
between PR proteins and resistance are discussed.The distribution of TMV and PR
la protein in and around single local necrotic lesions up to 14 days after
inoculation was measured by ELISA. The highest concentration of TMV was in the
centre of the lesion and decreased rapidly with distance from the centre. In
contrast there was very little PR la protein in the centre of the lesion, the
largest amounts were just outside the centre, and the concentration then
decreased with distance from the centre. This is the distribution that might be
expected for a substance closely associated with the restriction of virus spread.
