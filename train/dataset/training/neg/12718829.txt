BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate differences in HIV disease
progression in patients infected with HIV subtype B with a GPGR motif in the V3
loop region (B-GPGR) versus the Brazilian subtype B variant with a GWGR motif
(B'-GWGR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled in an ongoing cohort study at the
University of São Paulo Dermatology Clinic in Sao Paulo, Brazil. V3 serology was 
performed by enzyme immunoassay with peptides representing two HIV subtype B
strains, MN and SF2, and two Brazilian variant B'-GWGR strains. The incidence of 
AIDS-defining events was calculated, and Cox proportional hazards regression was 
used to estimate adjusted risk ratios.
RESULTS: Of the samples from 114 patients studied, 23 (20%) were classified as
B'-GWGR motif, and 91 (80%) as B-GPGR motif. Patients with T CD4+ cell counts
less than 200 cells/mm3 or 200-400 cells/mm3 experienced an increased incidence
of AIDS-defining events compared with patients who entered the cohort with T CD4+
cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3. In a proportional hazard model including 
age, gender, T CD4+ cell count at entry into the cohort, and V3 serology, GWGR
reactivity was associated with a decreased hazard rate for presenting an
AIDS-defining condition during follow-up. Three patients in the group with GPGR
serology died after experiencing an AIDS-defining event. None of the patients
with GWGR serology died during follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Survival analysis showed that patients infected with the Brazilian
subtype B variant with a GWGR motif in the V3 loop had lower risk, adjusted for
initial CD4+ cell count, of AIDS-defining events than patients infected with
subtype B-GPGR strains.
