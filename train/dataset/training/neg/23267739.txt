BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The diagnosis of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1
(HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is based on
clinical signs and the confirmation of HTLV-1 infection in the central nervous
system. Electrophysiological tests may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of spinal 
cord involvement. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) testing evaluates
the vestibulospinal tract, which is correlated with the motor tract; the target
of damage by HAM/TSP.
PURPOSE: This study examines the subclinical neurological alterations related to 
HTLV-1 infection in individuals with asymptomatic HTLV-1 infections, possible
HAM/TSP, and confirmed HAM/TSP.
STUDY DESIGN: Vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing was performed at the
beginning of the study and repeated every 6 months for 18 months. Ninety
volunteers were selected for the study: 30 were HTLV-1 seronegative (the control 
group) and 60 were HTLV-1 seropositive (of these, 18 were asymptomatic, 25 had
possible HAM/TSP, and 17 had confirmed HAM/TSP). The VEMP response was classified
as normal or abnormal (latency prolongation or no response). A change in the VEMP
response from normal to abnormal was the event of interest. To perform a survival
analysis, the subjects with normal VEMP responses at the first assessment were
selected.
METHODS: The results were analyzed blindly. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential 
was measured using short tone bursts as acoustic stimuli (1 kHz, 118 dBHL, a
rise-fall of 1 millisecond, and a plateau of 2 milliseconds). The stimulation
rate was 5 Hz, and the analysis time for each response was 60 milliseconds; each 
trial averaged 200 responses.
RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects in the control group was 38 ± 11 years
(median 35), and 13 (43%) were men. In the study group, the mean age was 51 ± 12 
years (median 53), and 12 (20%) were men. An analysis of the survival curve
indicated that the median time for a change in VEMP response from normal to
abnormal was 18 months, which is in agreement with the slow progression of
HTLV-1-associated neurologic disease. The survival analysis showed that the
change in VEMP response was significantly different between the asymptomatic and 
HAM/TSP groups (p=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing was useful for
monitoring the development of HAM/TSP in HTLV-1-infected individuals.
