Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) in goats is a complex disease syndrome
caused by a lentivirus. This persistent viral infection results in arthritis in
adult goats and encephalitis in lambs. The prognosis for the encephalitic form is
normally poor, and this form of the disease has caused substantial economic
losses for goat farmers. Hence, a more efficient detection platform based on
recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) was 
developed in the present study for detecting the proviral DNA of caprine
arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV). Under the optimal incubation conditions,
specifically, 30min at 37°C for RPA followed by 5min at room temperature for LFD,
the assay was found to be sensitive to a lower limit of 80pg of total DNA and 10 
copies of plasmid DNA. Furthermore, there was no cross-reaction with other tested
viruses, including goat pox virus and bovine leukemia virus. Given its simplicity
and portability, this RPA-LFD protocol can serve as an alternative tool to ELISA 
for the primary screening of CAEV, one that is suitable for both laboratory and
field application. When the RPA-LFD was applied in parallel with serological
ELISA for the detection of CAEV in field samples, the RPA-LFD assay exhibited a
higher sensitivity than the traditional method, and 82% of the 200 samples
collected in Taiwan were found to be positive. To our knowledge, this is the
first report providing evidence to support the use of an RPA-LFD assay as a
specific and sensitive platform for detecting CAEV proviral DNA in goats in a
faster manner, one that is also applicable for on-site utilization at farms and
that should be useful in both eradication programs and epidemiological studies.
