Characterization of specific immune complexes in HIV-related disorders.

Carini C, Mezzaroma I, Scano G, D'Amelio R, Matricardi P, Aiuti F.

Eighty-seven seropositive subjects with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
infection together with 20 normal controls with no history of any illness were
investigated for the presence of circulating immune complexes (CIC) by the
conglutinin binding assay (KgBA) and further studied for isotype characterization
of CIC. Six out of 87 patients showing very high values for immune complexes
(CIC) were studied for the presence of free antigen. In 3 out of 6 (1, IVc1; 1,
III; 1, IVa) we could detect by ultracentrifugation analysis the presence of
specific HIV (p15) anti-HIV (anti-p15) and gp41-anti-gp41 CIC. Evidence in favour
of this finding is supported by: the presence of specific CIC (p15-anti-p15 or
gp41-anti-gp41) seen only at pH 7.2; the apparent presence of free antigen and
specific HIV antibodies were only at pH 4.0. The relevance of this finding lies
in the attempt to explain the occurrence of false seronegativity seen
occasionally in symptomatic patients. Thus, the presence of CIC might perhaps
interfere in the routine assay (i.e. ELISA) making the diagnosis difficult. All
these considerations will have to be taken into account in the future handling of
this disease.
