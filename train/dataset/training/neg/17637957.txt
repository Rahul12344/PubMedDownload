Raman and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopies have the
potential to aid in detailed longitudinal studies of RNA localization. Here, we
evaluate the use of carbon-deuterium and benzonitrile functional group labels as 
contrast agents for vibrational imaging of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon RNA. 
Dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy were used to evaluate the
structural consequences of altering HCV subgenomic replicon RNA. Modification
with benzonitrile labels caused the replicon RNA tertiary structure to partially 
unfold. Conversely, deuterium-modified replicon RNA was structurally similar to
unmodified replicon RNA. Furthermore, the deuterated replicon RNA provided
promising vibrational contrast in Raman imaging experiments. The functional
effect of modifying subgenomic HCV replicon RNA was evaluated using the
luciferase gene as a genetic reporter of translation. Benzonitrile labeling of
the replicon RNA prevented translation in cell-based luciferase assays, while the
deuterated replicon RNA retained both translation and replication competency.
Thus, while the scattering cross-section for benzonitrile labels was higher, only
carbon-deuterium labels proved to be non-perturbative to the function of HCV
replicon RNA.
