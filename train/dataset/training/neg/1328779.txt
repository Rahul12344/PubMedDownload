BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common among HIV seropositive
patients, being difficult to diagnose because it requires cell cultures not
available in all hospitals. DNA amplification is being applied for diagnosis of
infectious diseases with an increase in sensitivity and specificity with respect 
to previous laboratory methods.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used in comparison with culture
isolation, early antigen detection to diagnose CMV infection in 22 HIV infected
patients, that suffered from symptoms compatible with CMV infection at the
present time, and in other 5 patients suffering from Kaposi sarcoma. PCR was done
with primer for CMV IE genomic region. The amplified sequences were detected
after hybridization with a gamma-P-32 labelled probe, followed by electrophoresis
in a 5% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography.
RESULTS: The PCR allows to detect CMV genome in cases in which other tests are
negatives, in blood as well as in urine, included those patients suffering only
from febrile symptoms or with other associated pathogen.
CONCLUSIONS: PCR is a sensitive method to detect CMV, although it does not
establish the responsibility of CMV in HIV infected patients.
