ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters can transfer a variety of antiviral
agents from the cytoplasm to body fluid, which results in a reduced intracellular
concentration of the drugs. Proteins of HIV-1, e.g., Tat and gp120, altered some 
types of ABC transporter expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells and 
astrocytes. However, the effect of Tat on ABC transporters in T lymphocytes is
unclear. In this study the status of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in
Tat expressing cell lines was examined with real-time PCR and flow cytometry. It 
was found that HIV-1 Tat protein upregulated BCRP expression and enhanced efflux 
mediated by BCRP significantly, which could inhibit antiviral drugs from entering
infected cells and interfere with the therapeutic effect of HAART.
