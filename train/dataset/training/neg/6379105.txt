Herpes simplex encephalitis. Immunohistological demonstration of spread of virus 
via olfactory and trigeminal pathways after infection of facial skin in mice.

Esiri MM, Tomlinson AH.

An immunohistological study of viral antigen (VA) in the brain was carried out in
mice which had been infected with herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV) in the skin
of the face. In 77% of the mice with VA in the brain the olfactory system as well
as the trigeminal system/brainstem was affected. The remaining 23% had VA in the 
trigeminal system/brainstem only. Eye swab cultures yielded HSV from all mice
with VA in the olfactory system. The ease of access of virus infecting the face
to the olfactory system shown in this model may have implications for human
infections.
