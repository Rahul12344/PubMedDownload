Dengue is a major global disease which, in its severe form, affects up to 500,000
people worldwide each year, most of whom are children. The development of a safe 
and effective vaccine is a clear priority, together with public health measures
to prevent the spread of infection. However, while major epidemics continue to
occur, clinicians must also focus on optimising management. Although no specific 
treatment is available at present, with good supportive care, mortality for
children with DHF can be reduced to well below 1%. In patients without signs of
shock, fluid replacement can be attempted orally, but in children with DSS
parenteral treatment is essential. Very careful titration of fluid therapy is
necessary combined with frequent reassessment for signs of worsening shock or the
development of fluid overload. In most DSS cases isotonic crystalloid solutions
are as effective as colloid solutions, but the question whether early
intervention with colloid solutions improves outcome in more advanced shock
requires further investigation. The outcome of studies to address this question, 
together with further research to examine the pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying the plasma leakage, will hopefully result in better management of
children with severe dengue but may also provide useful insights into other
diseases that affect endothelial function.
