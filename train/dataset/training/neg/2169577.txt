Immunization studies with HSV-1 and HSV-2 envelope proteins expressed in
Escherichia coli were performed. After active immunization of mice with a gD-1
antigen (Leu53-Ala312) expressed as a fusion protein, the animals were protected 
from a lethal challenge with HSV-1 and HSV-2. In addition, antisera from rabbits 
immunized with the same gD-1 antigen also conferred passive immunity to mice
against a challenge infection with either HSV-1 or HSV-2. In contrast to these
successful gD-1 protection experiments, various gC-1 and gC-2 fusion proteins
from E. coli failed to induce protective immunity. Moreover, the mice sera from
immunized animals were not able to react with the authentic, glycosylated gC-1
and gC-2 envelope proteins, whereas sera raised against authentic gC-1 and gC-2
glycoproteins do recognize the gC fusion proteins from E. coli. These results
indicate, that E. coli might represent an ideal system for expressing gD antigens
as a possible component of a HSV vaccine, whereas gC antigen cannot be produced
in an immunocompetent form in E. coli.
