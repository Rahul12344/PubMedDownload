HIV-1 infections and the resulting AIDS pandemic remain a global challenge in the
absence of a protective vaccine and because of rapid selection of drug-resistant 
viral variants in response to all currently available antiviral therapies. The
development of new and highly active antiviral agents would greatly facilitate
effective clinical management of HIV-1 infections and delay the onset of AIDS.
Recent advances in our understanding of intracellular immunity conferred by host 
cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and the mechanism by which 
the virally encoded virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein induces their
proteasomal degradation provide fresh opportunities for the development of novel 
antiviral treatments. Interestingly, the Vif-A3G and Vif-A3F interactions that
overcome this host defense mechanism are structurally distinct and provide two
potential targets for antiviral drug development. This review provides an
overview of current knowledge of APOBEC3-Vif interactions and recent efforts to
target these interactions for antiviral drug development.
