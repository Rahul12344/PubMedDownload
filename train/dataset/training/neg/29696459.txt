BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health issue worldwide. New
generation of direct-active antiviral medications is an epoch-making turning
point in the management of HCV infections.
OBJECTIVE: Conducing a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the combination of
elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin for the
management of all HCV patients (even those in the initial stages of fibrosis).
METHODS: A Markov model was built on the natural history of the disease to assess
the efficacy of the alternatives. The outcomes are expressed in terms of quality 
adjusted life-years (QALYs) and result in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio).
RESULTS: Elbasvir/grazoprevir implies an expenditure of €21,104,253.74 with a
gain of 19,287.90 QALYs and sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin implies
an expenditure of €31,904,410.11 with a gain of 18,855.96 QALYs.
Elbasvir/grazoprevir is thus a dominant strategy.
CONCLUSION: Consideration should be given to the opportunity cost of not treating
patients with a lower degree of fibrosis (F0-F2).
