To better define the contribution of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) to lower
respiratory tract infection in adults, we tested acute- and convalescent-phase
serum specimens from hospitalized adults participating in a population-based
prospective study of lower respiratory tract infection during 1991-1992. We
tested all available specimens from the epidemic seasons for each virus and
approximately 300 randomly selected specimens from the corresponding off-seasons 
for antibodies to HPIV-1, HPIV-2, or HPIV-3. During the respective epidemic
season, HPIV-1 infection was detected in 18 (2.5%) of 721 and HPIV-3 infection in
22 (3.1%) of 705 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. Only 2 (0.2%)
of 1,057 patients tested positive for HPIV-2 infection. No HPIV-1 infections and 
only 2 (0.7% of 281 patients tested) HPIV-3 infections were detected during the
off-seasons. HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 were among the four most frequently identified
infections associated with lower respiratory tract infection during their
respective outbreak seasons.
