Abstract White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and
infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) have been
responsible for major pandemics affecting the shrimp farming industry. Shrimp
samples were collected from eight farms in Hainan Province, China, during 2007
and analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR
methods to determine the prevalence of these viruses. From the eight sampling
locations, only samples from one farm did not show any indication of infection
with WSSV, TSV or IHHNV, while samples from one additional farm exhibited
evidence of infection with TSV only. Surprisingly, evidence of co-infection with 
TSV and IHHNV was found among samples at two farms while evidence of co-infection
with all three viruses (WSSV, TSV and IHHNV) was detected among shrimp samples at
four farms. To further elucidate the molecular characteristics of WSSV in China, 
we further analysed genomic features of WSSV isolates based on the ORF23/24
variable region. From these data, we identified two novel WSSV strains which
contain nucleotide deletions of 5657 and 11093 bp, respectively, when compared
with the largest WSSV-TW isolate.
