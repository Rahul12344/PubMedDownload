The mating efficiencies (the percentage of females inseminated by males) of
field-collected and laboratory-colonized Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera:
Culicidae) female mosquitoes transovarially infected or uninfected with La Crosse
virus (LACV) were compared. The females were placed in cages with age-matched
males, and the insemination rates (number of inseminated females of the total
number of females examined) were determined daily by detection of sperm in the
spermathecae. LACV-infected mosquitoes typically mated earlier than uninfected
mosquitoes, i.e., insemination occurred earlier after the mixing of males and
females. LACV load was not correlated with increased insemination.
