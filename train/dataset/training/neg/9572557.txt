The striped bass (SBR) virus, a member of the recently described aquareoviruses, 
infected, caused cytopathic effects (CPE), and replicated in mammalian cells. The
virus caused CPE in all 7 of the mammalian cell lines investigated. SBR virus
functioned best at lower temperatures and it is these lower temperatures that
appeared to be restricting factors for growth of some mammalian cells. At 22
degrees C the SBR virus grew to similar titers in both chinook salmon embryo
(CHSE) cells and in mammalian cells. Analysis of viral polypeptide and RNA
synthesis suggests that the restriction for viral growth at higher temperatures
occurs after adsorption but before transcription and translation of viral genes. 
The fact that SBR virus did not grow at 37 degrees C implies that aquareoviruses 
are unlikely to be human pathogens.
