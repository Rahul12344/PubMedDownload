BACKGROUND: Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)
selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells. Despite
this promising feature, TRAIL resistance observed in cancer cells seriously
challenged the use of TRAIL as a death ligand in gene therapy. The current
dispute concerns whether or not TRAIL receptor expression pattern is the primary 
determinant of TRAIL sensitivity in cancer cells. This study investigates TRAIL
receptor expression pattern and its connection to TRAIL resistance in breast
cancer cells. In addition, a DcR2 siRNA approach and a complementary gene therapy
modality involving IKK inhibition (AdIKKbetaKA) were also tested to verify if
these approaches could sensitize MCF7 breast cancer cells to adenovirus delivery 
of TRAIL (Ad5hTRAIL).
METHODS: TRAIL sensitivity assays were conducted using Molecular Probe's
Live/Dead Cellular Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit following the infection of breast
cancer cells with Ad5hTRAIL. The molecular mechanism of TRAIL induced cell death 
under the setting of IKK inhibition was revealed by Annexin V binding. Novel
quantitative Real Time RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis were performed to
disclose TRAIL receptor composition in breast cancer cells.
RESULTS: MCF7 but not MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells displayed strong resistance 
to adenovirus delivery of TRAIL. Only the combinatorial use of Ad5hTRAIL and
AdIKKbetaKA infection sensitized MCF7 breast cancer cells to TRAIL induced cell
death. Moreover, novel quantitative Real Time RT-PCR assays suggested that while 
the level of TRAIL Decoy Receptor-4 (TRAIL-R4) expression was the highest in MCF7
cells, it was the lowest TRAIL receptor expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. In
addition, conventional flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that TRAIL resistant 
MCF7 cells exhibited substantial levels of TRAIL-R4 expression but not TRAIL
decoy receptor-3 (TRAIL-R3) on surface. On the contrary, TRAIL sensitive
MDA-MB-231 cells displayed very low levels of surface TRAIL-R4 expression.
Furthermore, a DcR2 siRNA approach lowered TRAIL-R4 expression on surface and
this sensitized MCF7 cells to TRAIL.
CONCLUSION: The expression of TRAIL-R4 decoy receptor appeared to be well
correlated with TRAIL resistance encountered in breast cancer cells. Both
adenovirus mediated IKKbetaKA expression and a DcR2 siRNA approach sensitized
MCF7 breast cancer cells to TRAIL.
