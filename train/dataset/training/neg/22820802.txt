BACKGROUND: The goal of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is to suppress virus
replication to limit immune system damage. Some have proposed combining ART with 
immune therapies to boost antiviral immunity. For this to be successful, ART must
not impair physiological immune function.
METHODS: We studied the impact of ART (tenofovir and emtricitabine) on systemic
and mucosal immunity in uninfected and simian immunodeficiency (SIV)-infected
Chinese rhesus macaques. Subcutaneous ART was initiated 2 weeks after tonsillar
inoculation with SIVmac239.
RESULTS: There was no evidence of immune dysregulation as a result of ART in
either infected or uninfected animals. Early virus-induced alterations in
circulating immune cell populations (decreased central memory T cells and myeloid
dendritic cells) were detected, but normalized shortly after ART initiation.
ART-treated animals showed marginal SIV-specific T-cell responses during
treatment, which increased after ART discontinuation. Elevated expression of
CXCL10 in oral, rectal, and blood samples and APOBEC3G mRNA in oral and rectal
tissues was observed during acute infection and was down regulated after starting
ART. ART did not impact the ability of the animals to respond to tonsillar
application of polyICLC with increased CXCL10 expression in oral fluids and CD80 
expression on blood myeloid dendritic cells.
CONCLUSION: Early initiation of ART prevented virus-induced damage and did not
impede mucosal or systemic immune functions.
