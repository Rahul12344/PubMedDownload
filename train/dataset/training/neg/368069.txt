Processiveness of DNA polymerases. A comparative study using a simple procedure.

Das SK, Fujimura RK.

In this communication, we describe a simple procedure for analyzing the
processiveness of DNA polymerases in general. By choosing conditions for which
the number of incorporations per available primer is less than 1, we have reduced
the probability of a primer molecule being utilized by the enzyme more than once.
The primer-template used was poly(dA)300:oligo(dT)10, and the product was
isolated by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The number of dTMP residues added
per association was determined from the [3H]dThd + [3'-3H]dTMP/[3H]dThd ratio of 
the product after its digestion by micrococcal nuclease and spleen
phosphodiesterase. Using this procedure, we have found that Escherichia coli DNA 
polymerase I, T4 DNA polymerase, and calf thymus alpha- and beta-DNA polymerase
are "quasi-processive." Most of these enzymes add on the average approximately 10
to 15 nucleotides before dissociating from the template. T5 DNA polymerase, on
the other hand, is processive, i.e. it continues to replicate a given template
until it is very close to the 5' end of the template. With "nicked DNA-like"
poly(dA):oligo(dT), the processiveness of E. coli DNA polymerase I is increased
2- to 2.5-fold. The significance of this increase in determining the "patch size"
during DNA repair is discussed.
