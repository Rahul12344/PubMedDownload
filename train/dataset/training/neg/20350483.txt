HIV-1 infection is characterized by a continuous viral replication throughout the
illness that can be controlled to some extent by effective treatment. Early
during primary infection, latent reservoirs where the virus remains hidden in
metabolically inert cells are established. These reservoirs are responsible for a
low-rate viral replication that can be observed even during effective treatment
and are a major obstacle for the complete eradication of the infection. This
low-rate viral replication also comes from anatomical sites where drug
penetration is limited and only a suboptimal drug concentration can be achieved. 
Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 latency is of primary
importance to develop new strategies that ensure the complete destruction of
reservoirs and, therefore, the eradication of the infection.
