The natural human antibody response is a rich source of highly specific,
neutralizing and self-tolerant therapeutic reagents. Recent advances have been
made in isolating and characterizing monoclonal antibodies that are generated in 
response to natural infection or vaccination. Studies of the human antibody
response have led to the discovery of crucial epitopes that could serve as new
targets in vaccine design and in the creation of potentially powerful
immunotherapies. With a focus on influenza virus and HIV, herein we summarize the
technological tools used to identify and characterize human monoclonal antibodies
and describe how these tools might be used to fight infectious diseases.
