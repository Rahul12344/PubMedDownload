Viral envelope proteins are required for productive viral entry and initiation of
infection. Although the humoral immune system provides ample evidence for
targeting envelope proteins as an antiviral strategy, there are few
pharmacological interventions that have this mode of action. In contrast to
classical antiviral targets such as viral proteases and polymerases, viral
envelope proteins as a class do not have a well-conserved active site that can be
rationally targeted with small molecules. We previously identified compounds that
inhibit dengue virus by binding to its envelope protein, E. Here, we show that
these small molecules inhibit dengue virus fusion and map the binding site of
these compounds to a specific pocket on E. We further demonstrate inhibition of
Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses by these compounds, providing 
pharmacological evidence for the pocket as a target for developing broad-spectrum
antivirals against multiple, mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogens.
