The occurrence of subclinical reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from immunocompetent subjects >60 years
old without any signs of VZV-caused illnesses, and from immunocompromised
patients was investigated. Altogether, 223 samples were tested by nested ORF 63
PCR assay. In addition, all positive samples were tested by ORF 14, ORF 29 and
ORF 63 PCR assays, as well as by ORF 63 and ORF 68 nucleic acid sequence-based
amplification assays. In 5 samples, VZV-specific DNA, but no transcripts, could
be detected. Three of them belonged to the group of >60-year-olds, 1 was HIV
positive, the other was being treated with chemotherapy. The results confirm the 
observation of other authors that subclinical reactivation occurs in both
immunocompromised and healthy individuals. The failure to detect DNA in samples
taken from 2 individuals several weeks later excludes a long-lasting infection of
VZV in PBMC.
