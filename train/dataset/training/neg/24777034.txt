Advanced nucleic acid-based technologies are powerful research tools for novel
virus discovery but need to be standardized for broader applications such as
virus detection in biological products and clinical samples. We have used
well-characterized retrovirus stocks to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD) for
broad-range PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or
PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. The results indicated that in the
absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar
LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per ÂµL) 
whereas sensitivity of virus detection was 10-fold greater using virus
microarrays. When virus was spiked into a background of cellular nucleic acids,
the LOD using PLEX-ID remained the same, whereas virus detection by RT-PCR was
10-fold less sensitive, and no virus could be detected by microarrays. Expected
endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in cell lines tested and
known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine 
trypsin. A follow-up strategy was developed using PCR amplification, nucleotide
sequencing, and bioinformatics to demonstrate that an RD114-like retrovirus
sequence that was detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines (Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) and Cf2Th canine thymus) was due to defective, endogenous
gammaretrovirus-related sequences.
