BACKGROUND: Since establishment of Zimbabwe's National Antiretroviral Therapy
(ART) Programme in 2004, ART provision has expanded from <5,000 to 369,431 adults
by 2011. However, patient outcomes are unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To determine improvement in health status, retention and factors
associated with attrition among HIV-infected patients on ART.
METHODS: A retrospective review of abstracted patient records of adults ≥ 15
years who initiated ART from 2007 to 2009 was done. Frequencies and medians were 
calculated for rates of retention in care and changes in key health status
outcomes at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to determine factors associated with attrition.
RESULTS: Of the 3,919 patients, 64% were female, 86% were either WHO clinical
stage III or IV. Rates of patient retention at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were
90.7%, 78.1%, 68.8% and 64.4%, respectively. After ART initiation, median weight 
gains at 6, 12, and 24 months were 3, 4.5, and 5.0 kgs whilst median CD4+ cell
count gains at 6, 12 and 24 months were 122, 157 and 279 cells/µL respectively.
Factors associated with an increased risk of attrition included male gender (AHR 
1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4), baseline WHO stage IV (AHR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6), lower
baseline body weight (AHR 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2. 8) and accessing care from higher
level healthcare facilities (AHR 3.5; 95% 1.1-11.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings with regard to retention as well as clinical and
immunological improvements following uptake of ART, are similar to what has been 
found in other settings. Factors influencing attrition also mirror those found in
other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. These findings suggest the need to strengthen 
earlier diagnosis and treatment to further improve treatment outcomes. Whilst
decentralisation improves ART coverage it should be coupled with strategies aimed
at improving patient retention.
