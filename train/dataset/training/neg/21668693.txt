BACKGROUND: To augment established influenza surveillance systems in the United
States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Council of State
and Territorial Epidemiologists implemented the Aggregate Hospitalization and
Death Reporting Activity (AHDRA) in August 2009. The AHDRA was designed to meet
increased demands for timely and detailed information describing illness severity
during the 2009 H1N1 influenza A (pH1N1) pandemic response.
OBJECTIVES: We describe the implementation of AHDRA and provide preliminary
results from this new surveillance activity.
METHODS: All 50 US states were asked to report influenza-associated
hospitalizations and deaths to AHDRA each week using either a
laboratory-confirmed or syndromic surveillance definition. Aggregate counts were 
used to calculate age-specific weekly and cumulative rates per 100,000, and
laboratory-confirmed reports were used to estimate the age distribution of pH1N1 
influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths.
RESULTS: From August 30, 2009, through April 6, 2010, AHDRA identified 41,689
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations and 2096
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths. Aggregate Hospitalization and
Death Reporting Activity rates peaked earlier than hospitalization and death
rates seen in previous influenza seasons with other surveillance systems, and the
age distribution of cases revealed a tendency for hospitalizations and deaths to 
occur in persons <65 years for age.
CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate Hospitalization and Death Reporting Activity
laboratory-confirmed reports provided important information during the 2009
pandemic response. Aggregate Hospitalization and Death Reporting Activity
syndromic reports were marked by low representativeness and specificity and were 
therefore less useful. The AHDRA was implemented quickly and may be a useful
surveillance system to monitor severe illness during future influenza pandemics.
