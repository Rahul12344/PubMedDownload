Use of adjuvant containing pathogen pattern recognition receptor agonists is one 
of the effective strategies to enhance the efficacy of licensed vaccines. In this
study, we investigated the efficacy of avian influenza vaccines containing an
adjuvant (CVCVA5) which was composed of polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic,
resiquimod, imiquimod, muramyl dipeptide and levomisole. Avian influenza vaccines
adjuvanted with CVCVA5 were found to induce significantly higher titers of
hemagglutiniton inhibition antibodies (P≤0.01) than those of commercial vaccines 
at 2-, 3- and 4-week post vaccination in both specific pathogen free (SPF)
chickens and field application. Furthermore, virus shedding was reduced in SPF
chickens immunized with H9-CVCVA5 vaccine after H9 subtype heterologous virus
challenge. The ratios of both CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) lymphocytes were
slowly elevated in chickens immunized with H9-CVCVA5 vaccine. Lymphocytes
adoptive transfer study indicates that CD8(+) T lymphocyte subpopulation might
have contributed to improved protection against heterologous virus challenge.
Results of this study suggest that the adjuvant CVCVA5 was capable of enhancing
the potency of existing avian influenza vaccines by increasing humoral and
cellular immune response.
