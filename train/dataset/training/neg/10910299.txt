Increase awareness and publicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has
fostered a heightened sense of concern regarding the transmission of infectious
agents during sports and athletic competition. Although the potential risk is
low, there are other unanswered questions and issues regarding infectious disease
and sports. Viral hepatitis is a common infection and predominantly affects the
young who are most likely to lead active lives and engage in both amateur and
competitive sport-related activity. This article summarizes the common forms of
viral hepatitis and the associated clinical syndromes. In addition, a review of
the literature addressing the effect of exercise and the various states of liver 
disease is presented. Finally, I will address the question regarding
participation and return to physical activity following acute viral hepatitis, as
well as chronic hepatitis.
