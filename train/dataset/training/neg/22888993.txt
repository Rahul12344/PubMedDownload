Helix-helix interactions are fundamental to many biological signals and systems
and are found in homo- or heteromultimerization of signaling molecules as well as
in the process of virus entry into the host. In HIV, virus-host membrane fusion
during infection is mediated by the formation of six-helix bundles (6HBs) from
homotrimers of gp41, from which a number of synthetic peptides have been derived 
as antagonists of virus entry. Using a yeast surface two-hybrid (YS2H) system, a 
platform designed to detect protein-protein interactions occurring through a
secretory pathway, we reconstituted 6HB complexes on the yeast surface,
quantitatively measured the equilibrium and kinetic constants of soluble 6HB, and
delineated the residues influencing homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric
coiled-coil interactions. Hence, we present YS2H as a platform for the facile
characterization and design of antagonistic peptides for inhibition of HIV and
many other enveloped viruses relying on membrane fusion for infection, as well as
cellular signaling events triggered by hetero-oligomeric coiled coils.
