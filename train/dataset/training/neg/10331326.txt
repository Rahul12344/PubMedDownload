After the fall of the communist government in Romania, many children were found
to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected. The majority of these children
were abandoned and currently live in orphanages. The children have been cared for
on a day-to-day basis by nurses with little general nursing education and even
less HIV education. The Romanian-American Pediatric AIDS Education and Clinical
Research Program was established at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College 
of Medicine in May, 1996 to aid in the education of Romanian nurses. Syllabi
developed by the U.S. nursing team were initially piloted in three pediatric HIV 
centers in Romania in July, 1997. Since that time, two annual nursing symposia
have been held offering topics on general pediatrics and HIV-related content. The
purpose of this article is to describe a program of HIV education for nurses in
Romania.
