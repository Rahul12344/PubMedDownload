More than 6,000 mosquitoes of six species from six sites were collected and
tested for their virome using metagenomics sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.
The identified viral sequences belonged to more than 50 viral families. The
results were verified by PCR of selected viruses in all mosquitoes, followed by
phylogenetic analysis. In the present study, we identified the partial dengue
virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) sequences 
in mosquitoes. Metagenomic analysis and the PCR amplification revealed three DENV
sequences, one of which encodes a partial envelope protein. Two ZIKV sequences
both encoding partial nonstructural protein 3 and one JEV sequence encoding the
complete envelope protein were identified. There was variability in the viral
titers of the newly isolated virus JEV-China/YN2016-1 of different passage
viruses. The newly identified Zika virus gene from ZIKV-China/YN2016-1 was an
Asian genotype and shared the highest nucleotide sequence identity (97.1%) with a
ZIKV sequence from Thailand isolated in 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of
ZIKV-China/YN2016-1 and ZIKV-China/YN2016-2 with known Flavivirus genes indicated
that ZIKV has propagated in Yunnan province, China.
