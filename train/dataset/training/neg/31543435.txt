We report an AIDS patient with a high HIV RNA copy number in the plasma who was
successfully treated for prolonged Mycobacterium avium bacteremia and other
complications. An HIV-infected patient with high fever, anemia, high alkaline
phosphatase, cystic lung lesions, hepatitis B virus infection and Kaposi's
sarcoma was referred to our hospital. PCR of the blood revealed Mycobacterium
avium bacteremia and the time to blood culture positivity was 8 days. The HIV-1
RNA copy number in the plasma was more than ten million copies/ml and the
CD4-positive T cell count was 21 cells/μL. Although the high fever resolved five 
days after therapy for Mycobacterium avium was started, the fever recurred just
before starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) including dolutegravir. The patient
experienced repeated but self-limiting bouts of severe inflammation.
Mycobacteremia was intermittently detected up to 79 days, suggesting that the
recurrent episodes of inflammation were due to the intermittent dissemination of 
mycobacteria, and that persistent treatment is needed. Five months after the
beginning of ART, the HIV-1 RNA copy number in the plasma was still 28,000
copies/ml. An HIV drug-resistance test revealed sensitivity to all
anti-retroviral drugs. Eleven months after the initiation of ART, the HIV RNA
copy number in the plasma decreased to 45 copies/mL and the CD4-positive T cell
count recovered to 205 cells/μL. Our case also suggests that dolutegravir can be 
effective in cases with prolonged high levels of HIV RNA. Our findings emphasize 
that prompt diagnosis and persistent therapy for mycobacterial infection are
important for successful treatment.
