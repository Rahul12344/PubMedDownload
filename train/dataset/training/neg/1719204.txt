Analysis of molecularly cloned DNAs of SIVs isolated from Asian rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta; SIVmac) and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina; SIVmne) has
indicated a high degree of sequence homology between these viruses. Thus SIVmac
and SIVmne might have originated from the same or very closely related viruses.
We have cloned and sequenced a PCR-amplified segment containing the LTR sequences
of SIV originating from a stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides; SIVstm).
Comparative sequence analysis indicates that SIVstm belongs to the SIV/HIV-2
group; however, it is genetically distinct from the other members.
