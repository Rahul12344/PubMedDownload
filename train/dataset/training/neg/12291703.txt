Signing of HIV / AIDS strategy.

[No authors listed]

The Philippines has scored a very important success in controlling the spread of 
HIV as it launched the Philippine National HIV/AIDS Strategy. This document will 
serve as a guide to all the policies and programs that will be created in
relation to HIV/AIDS. President Fidel Ramos, who personally launched the strategy
in Malacanang Palace, said that it is not too late to prevent a large-scale
epidemic at this point, although he admitted that the solutions would not be
simple. He said that the fight against HIV/AIDS must be universal and should not 
be left to the Department of Health alone. Since HIV affects all sectors of
society, the president stressed the importance of multisectoral responses to slow
down the HIV epidemic. Secretary Ramiro, for his part, said that the strategy
prescribes the national response to the epidemic and reduces its impact on
individuals, families, and communities. A project of the Philippine National AIDS
Council through its Committee on Policy Development (CPD), the National HIV/AIDS 
Strategy had undergone months of thorough nationwide consultative workshops and
researches. With its launching, this unified multisectoral approach will
eventually create a greater impact in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
