A strong promoter of bacteriophage MB78 does not have minus 35 consensus sequence
although it has a TGn motif immediately upstream of minus 10 sequence as well as 
the AT rich UP element. It is efficiently recognised by the sigma 70 RNA
polymerase, however, a phage-specific factor competes with sigma 70 RNA
polymerase for binding to this region, the binding of the factor being stronger
than that of the polymerase. Contrary to the reports in the literature the
polymerase appears not to bind to the UP element whereas the phage-specific
factor does. The latter seems to be involved in the regulation of the promoter
activity.
