The use of highly concentrated purified (by a large scale method) and long term
liquid nitrogen stored foot-and-mouth disease viruses for the preparation of
vaccines: physico-chemical quality controls and potency tests after storage.

In 1974 a new industrial technique for concentration and purification of FMD
virus was presented at the OIE Conference. The bulk inactivated virus from this
technique was stored in liquid nitrogen vapour until required for vaccine
formulation. In 1981, having applied this technique regularly for seven years, we
now describe the results obtained and the advantages gained in the field of
trivalent O, A, C bovine vaccine production. Vaccines prepared from such bulk
virus stocks after several years storage give good protection against virulent
virus challenge.
