Comparative studies of some properties of Herpes simplex viruses type I and II
and their ability to reproduce latent infection in vitro revealed no essential
differences between them. Virus-neutralizing and hemagglutinating antibodies to
the virus type II are detected reliably more frequently in cervical cancer
patients than in healthy ones. Forty six per cent of cervical cancer patients and
thirty nine per cent of healthy females along with antibodies against the virus
of serotype II showed a specific cellular response, which was demonstrated in the
reaction of leucocyte migration inhibition. In patients with dissemination of the
disease there is an inhibited cell immunity to Herpes virus without changing of
the humoral resistance.
