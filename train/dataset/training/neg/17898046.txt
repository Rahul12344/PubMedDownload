A monoclonal Fab (Fab 3674) selected from a human nonimmune phage library by
panning against the chimeric construct N(CCG)-gp41 (which comprises an exposed
coiled-coil trimer of gp41 N helices fused in the helical phase onto the minimal 
thermostable ectodomain of gp41) is described. Fab 3674 is shown to neutralize
diverse laboratory-adapted B strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) and primary isolates of subtypes A, B, and C in an Env-pseudotyped-virus 
neutralization assay, albeit with reduced potency (approximately 25-fold)
compared to that of 2F5 and 4E10. Alanine scanning mutagenesis maps a novel
epitope to a shallow groove on the N helices of gp41 that is exposed between two 
C helices in the fusogenic six-helix bundle conformation of gp41. Bivalent Fab
3674 and the C34 peptide (a potent fusion inhibitor derived from the C helix of
gp41) are shown to act at similar stages of the fusion reaction and to neutralize
HIV-1 synergistically, providing additional evidence that the epitope of Fab 3674
is new and distinct from the binding site of C34.
