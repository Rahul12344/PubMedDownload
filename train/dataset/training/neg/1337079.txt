A 70-year-old man presented with clonal large granular lymphocytosis of
T-suppressor/cytotoxic immunophenotype, neutropenia, paraproteinemia, and
proneness to infection. The patient became severely leukopenic during 14 days of 
chemotherapy with low-dose cyclophosphamide, and remained so after
discontinuation of the drug. Clinically, he was thought to have prolonged
chemotherapy-induced marrow hypoplasia. At death, 16 days after the last dose of 
chemotherapy, autopsy confirmed bone marrow hypoplasia and revealed that
well-differentiated, polymorphous, and (immunophenotypically and genotypically)
polyclonal B-lymphocytes predominated in normal hematopoietic and lymphoid
organs. A similar lymphoid infiltrate was intimately associated with multiple
ulcers and smooth muscle necrosis in the stomach. These terminal findings
resemble B-lymphoproliferative conditions described in certain forms of immune
deficiency.
