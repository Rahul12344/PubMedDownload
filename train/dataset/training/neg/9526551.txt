Variation within a 523 nucleotide region proximal to the 5' terminus of seven
rubella virus strains has been analysed. Compared to the Therien strain twenty
sites of nucleotide variation have been identified, three of which are in the 5' 
untranslated region. Individual strains have between three and nine nucleotide
differences, only three of which result in amino acid substitutions. TO-336 has a
serine for threonine at amino acid (aa) 42 and CM arginine for histidine at aa
159. RA27/3 has arginine for lysine at aa 3 and serine for threonine at aa 42.
Nucleotide differences which affect a stem-loop structure reported to be
important for binding of host cell proteins have been identified.
