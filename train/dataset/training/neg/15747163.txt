Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis secondary to chronic parvovirus B19 (B19)
infection presenting with recurrent neurological findings is a very rare disorder
during childhood. Here we report a 12-year-old boy with a renal transplant who
had chronic B19 infection with skin eruptions and recurrent episodes of
encephalopathy with focal neurological deficits. B19 DNA was detected in blood,
bone marrow, and skin biopsy specimens. Repeat cranial magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging during each episode of encephalopathy showed variable focal findings, and
MR angiography revealed vasculitic changes with narrowing of the cerebral
arteries. We hypothesized that the CNS vasculitis might be associated with the
chronic B19 infection. At the time of his fourth presentation with the same
clinical findings, we administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (1 g/kg per 
day, 2 consecutive days), which we continued for 6 months, at monthly intervals. 
IVIG therapy resulted in remission and has been effective not only for the
clearance of B19, but also for the improvement of clinical and radiological
findings of CNS vasculitis. We suggest that chronic B19 infection should be
considered in immunocompromised patients with suspected CNS vasculitis. IVIG
should be considered as a part of the treatment.
