Rotaviruses were detected using ELISA and latex agglutination, in 210 of 826
(25.4%) stool specimens collected from children with gastroenteritis between
October 1984 and August 1990. In 82 of the 85 specimens (96%), Rotavirus specific
RNA pattern was detected with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver
staining. In 44 of the 56 strains with long migration pattern, 20 different
electropherotypes and in 25 of the 26 strains with short migration pattern, 9
different electropherotypes were seen, respectively. Of the remaining strains, 3 
were accepted as having mixed RNA pattern since 15 or 16 bands were detected in
electrophoresis and 2 strains (one from long; one from short migration pattern)
showed an extra RNA band.
