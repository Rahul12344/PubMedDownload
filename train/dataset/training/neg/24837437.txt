Damage to the intestinal mucosa results in the translocation of microbes from the
intestinal lumen into the circulation. Microbial translocation has been proposed 
to trigger immune activation, inflammation, and coagulopathy, all of which are
key factors that drive HIV disease progression and non-HIV comorbidities;
however, direct proof of a causal link is still lacking. Here, we have
demonstrated that treatment of acutely SIV-infected pigtailed macaques with the
drug sevelamer, which binds microbial lipopolysaccharide in the gut, dramatically
reduces immune activation and inflammation and slightly reduces viral
replication. Furthermore, sevelamer administration reduced coagulation
biomarkers, confirming the contribution of microbial translocation in the
development of cardiovascular comorbidities in SIV-infected nonhuman primates.
Together, our data suggest that early control of microbial translocation may
improve the outcome of HIV infection and limit noninfectious comorbidities
associated with AIDS.
