Rotavirus causes one-third to one-half of severe diarrheal disease in children
under the age of five years worldwide. In 2006 two rotavirus vaccines became
available and, in the intervening years, approximately thirty countries have
introduced them into their immunization programs, primarily in high-income and
middle-income settings. Major reductions in rotavirus hospitalizations have been 
observed in a number of these locations, and in select countries, there have been
impacts on gastroenteritis mortality associated with rotavirus vaccine
introduction. In addition to these direct health benefits, reduced
gastroenteritis risk has been documented in unvaccinated groups, including older 
children and adults, suggesting indirect benefits (i.e. herd immunity). In this
paper, we summarize what has been learned from programs studying post-licensure
vaccine effectiveness, impact on health-care utilization and death, safety issues
(namely, intussception and the detection of adventitious viruses) and the
potential selective pressure of vaccination on the diversity of rotavirus
genotypes.
