Complex interactions between DNA herpesviruses and host factors determine the
establishment of a life-long asymptomatic latent infection. The lymphotropic
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seems to avoid recognition by innate sensors despite
massive transcription of immunostimulatory small RNAs (EBV-EBERs). Here we
demonstrate that in latently infected B cells, EBER1 transcripts interact with
the lupus antigen (La) ribonucleoprotein, avoiding cytoplasmic RNA sensors.
However, in coculture experiments we observed that latent-infected cells trigger 
antiviral immunity in dendritic cells (DCs) through selective release and
transfer of RNA via exosomes. In ex vivo tonsillar cultures, we observed that
EBER1-loaded exosomes are preferentially captured and internalized by human
plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that express the TIM1 phosphatidylserine receptor, a
known viral- and exosomal target. Using an EBER-deficient EBV strain, enzymatic
removal of 5'ppp, in vitro transcripts, and coculture experiments, we established
that 5'pppEBER1 transfer via exosomes drives antiviral immunity in nonpermissive 
DCs. Lupus erythematosus patients suffer from elevated EBV load and activated
antiviral immunity, in particular in skin lesions that are infiltrated with pDCs.
We detected high levels of EBER1 RNA in such skin lesions, as well as
EBV-microRNAs, but no intact EBV-DNA, linking non-cell-autonomous EBER1 presence 
with skin inflammation in predisposed individuals. Collectively, our studies
indicate that virus-modified exosomes have a physiological role in the
host-pathogen stand-off and may promote inflammatory disease.
