Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is increasingly becoming a disease
managed by HIV specialists. However, all primary care physicians have an
important role that can affect the epidemic in the United States. These
physicians must be able to appropriately identify patients at risk, screen for
and diagnose HIV, provide counsel, and refer those who are infected to
specialists. The primary care physician will often continue to provide medical
care in collaboration with an HIV specialist. The patient will receive optimal
care when the primary care physician is knowledgeable regarding HIV and the
evaluation of the newly diagnosed patient. Through appropriate screening,
evaluation, diagnosis, and counseling, the primary care physician will not only
improve the care of the individual patient but also potentially decrease the
spread of HIV. This article answers some of the questions that primary care
physicians are likely to have when evaluating an adult with newly diagnosed HIV
infection.
