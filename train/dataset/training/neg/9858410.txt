OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antibody to bovine adenovirus (BAdV)
serotypes 1-8 and 10 in calves at a farm and after 5 weeks in a feedyard.
ANIMALS: 2- to 5-month-old calves of mixed English breeding (n = 100) from 4
farms.
PROCEDURE: Serum BAdV antibody was measured by use of a microtitration test.
RESULTS: Serum antibodies were found to the 9 BAdV serotypes studied.
Seroconversion to each virus had occurred in some calves by the time the second
serum sample had been obtained, indicating that the BAdV were present and
inducing active infection in these calves.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibody to BAdV serotypes 1-8 and 10 are present in cattle
populations of the United States, indicating existence of these serotypes,
although only BAdV serotypes 1-4, 7, and 10 have been isolated.
