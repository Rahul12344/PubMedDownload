Viral infections were a major cause of mortality until the use of vaccination and
antiviral drugs became widespread. During the last 10 years, immunologists have
made tremendous progress in dissecting mechanisms that contribute to the success 
of vaccines, in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of innate
immunity, and in recognizing the complexity of immunological memory. Virologists 
have also made great progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of how
viruses evade, manipulate, and interact with host cellular processes. In spite of
these advances, most of the basic mechanisms of antiviral immunity in the host
are still poorly understood due to the complexity and specificity of virus-host
interactions. Here we report on advances from the recent Keystone Symposia "Viral
Immunity," organized in Keystone, Colorado on January 20-25, 2008 by Jack R.
Bennink, Marcia A. Blackman, and Ann B. Hill.
