We have solved the structure of a chimeric T7/T3 RNA polymerase (RNAP) in an
orthorhombic crystal by molecular replacement with the T7 RNAP structure
determined from a monoclinic crystal. The structure of the protruding "thumb"
subdomain of the polymerase appears very different in these two crystals
apparently because of differences in packing contacts made by the thumb
subdomain. These observations support the proposal that the thumb subdomain is
flexible and can wrap around bound template to obstruct polymerase: template
dissociation during processive synthesis.
