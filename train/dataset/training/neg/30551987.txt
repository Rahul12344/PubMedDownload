Australia's transition to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) based cervical
screening, has for the first time, provided a passive mechanism for monitoring
the impact of vaccination on infection prevalence among women attending
screening. We assessed oncogenic HPV prevalence by single year of age in the
first 7  months of the program, using data collected from a large screening
laboratory in Victoria, Australia, which is routinely screening using cobas 4800,
cobas 6800 and Seegene assays. Among 116,052 primary screening samples from women
aged 25-74, 9.25% (95%CI: 9.09-9.42%) had oncogenic HPV detected: 2.14% (95%CI:
2.05-2.22%) were 16/18 positive and 7.12% (95%CI: 6.97-7.27%) were positive for
only non-16/18 HPV. Prevalence peaked at age 25-29 then decreased with age, but
this was driven by non-16/18 types. HPV16/18 prevalence remained low and flat
across ages, contrasting with pre-vaccination epidemiology when HPV16/18 peaked
in young women. HPV-based screening can precisely monitor HPV prevalence.
