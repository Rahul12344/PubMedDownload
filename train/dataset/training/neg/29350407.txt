Viral infections cause many serious human diseases with high mortality rates. New
drug-resistant strains are continually emerging due to the high viral mutation
rate, which makes it necessary to develop new antiviral agents. Compounds of
plant origin are particularly interesting. The pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs)
are a diverse class of natural products from plants composed of three terpene
units. They exhibit antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities.
Oleanolic, betulinic, and ursolic acids are representative PTs widely present in 
nature with a broad antiviral spectrum. This review focuses on the recent
literatures in the antiviral efficacy of this class of phytochemicals and their
derivatives. In addition, their modes of action are also summarized.
