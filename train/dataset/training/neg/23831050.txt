BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rotavirus infection is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in children younger than 5 years of age. Current treatment options are 
limited. We assessed the efficacy of a llama-derived, heavy-chain antibody
fragment called anti-rotavirus protein (ARP1), in modifying the severity and
duration of diarrhea in male infants with rotavirus infection.
METHODS: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 176 male
infants (6-24 months old) with severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea at Dhaka
Hospital, Bangladesh. The infants were randomly assigned to groups given oral
ARP1 (15-30 mg/kg/day, n = 88) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 88) for a maximum of
5 days. The primary outcomes were severity (stool output) and duration of
diarrhea and fecal excretion of rotavirus. Secondary outcomes were intake of oral
rehydration salt solution, severity of vomiting, and serum levels of
rotavirus-specific IgA.
RESULTS: In infants with only rotavirus infection, total cumulative stool output 
was 305.47 g/kg body weight among those given placebo (n = 63) and 237.03 g/kg
body weight among those given ARP1 (n = 61) (a difference of 68.44 g/kg body
weight or 22.5%; 95% confidence interval: 18.27-118.59 g/kg body weight; P
=.0079). There was a significant reduction in rate of stool output (g/kg/d) in
the ARP1 group compared with the placebo group (61%; P = .002). ARP1 had no
significant effect in infants with concomitant infections or on any other
measured outcomes. No adverse events could be linked to ARP1.
CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled trial, ARP1 reduced stool output in male
infants with severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Clinicaltrials.gov number:
NCT01259765.
