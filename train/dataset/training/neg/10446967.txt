Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a nonpathogenic, single-stranded DNA virus
belonging to the parvoviridae family. Onco-suppressive properties of AAV against 
adenovirus, a DNA tumor virus, have been well documented. Rep78, a major
regulatory protein of AAV, is believed to be responsible for its antioncogenic
properties. Most DNA tumor viruses disturb the cell cycle pathways by essentially
abrogating the functions of p53. Here we present evidence that AAV acts as an
antiproliferative agent against adenovirus by protecting the adenoviral-mediated 
degradation of p53 as confirmed by both Western blot analysis and
immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-p53 antibody. Coimmunoprecipitation
experiments revealed that the AAV Rep78 is physically bound to p53 in vivo.
Furthermore, the binding of purified p53 to the AAV Rep78 affinity column
confirms their interaction. These results document for the first time that the
antiproliferative effects of AAV against adenovirus are mediated, at least in
part, by the interaction of AAV Rep78 with p53.
