Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is transmitted by insect vectors, and therefore
vaccination is one of the most important tools of disease control. In our study, 
novel subunit vaccines on the basis of an amino-terminal domain of SBV Gc of 234 
amino acids ("Gc Amino") first were tested and selected using a lethal small
animal challenge model and then the best performing formulations also were tested
in cattle. We could show that neither E. coli expressed nor the reduced form of
"Gc Amino" protected from SBV infection. In contrast, both, immunization with "Gc
Amino"-encoding DNA plasmids and "Gc-amino" expressed in a mammalian system,
conferred protection in up to 66% of the animals. Interestingly, the best
performance was achieved with a multivalent antigen containing the covalently
linked Gc domains of both, SBV and the related Akabane virus. All vaccinated
cattle and mice were fully protected against SBV challenge infection.
Furthermore, in the absence of antibodies against the viral N-protein,
differentiation between vaccinated and field-infected animals allows an SBV
marker vaccination concept. Moreover, the presented vaccine design also could be 
tested for other members of the Simbu serogroup and might allow the inclusion of 
additional immunogenic domains.
