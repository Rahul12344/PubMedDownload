An intragenic enhancer in the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has
previously been identified (Verdin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
87:4874-4878, 1990). This element is composed of two subdomains both exhibiting
phorbol ester-inducible enhancing activity on the viral thymidine kinase promoter
in HeLa cells. Examination of the nucleotide sequence of one of these domains
(nucleotides 4079 to 4342, HXB2 isolate) revealed the presence of three short DNA
regions highly homologous to the recognition site for cellular transcription
factor AP-1. Two short oligonucleotides containing these AP-1 sites each
functioned as a phorbol ester-inducible enhancer when cloned upstream of the
thymidine kinase promoter and transfected into HeLa cells. Gel mobility shift
assays and competition experiments using the same two oligonucleotides
demonstrated that they bound affinity-purified AP-1 or AP-1 present in uninduced 
and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced HeLa nuclear extracts.
Footprinting experiments confirmed that all three predicted sites bound purified 
AP-1. These results suggest that the AP-1 factor could play a role in the
transcriptional regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene
expression.
