PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence, management, and
outcomes for needle stick injuries (NSIs) in a tertiary eye-care hospital and
provide appropriate recommendations for its prevention.
METHODS: This was a retrospective database review of NSI recorded between 2010
and 2015 at a tertiary eye care center. All staff members who had NSI were
managed with standard treatment protocol. The mode, location, health-care workers
affected and/or at risk for NSI were analyzed.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty NSI were reported between 2010 and 2015, with
ophthalmic fellows under training encountering maximum needle pricks (n = 33;
24%), followed by nursing staff (n = 32; 23%), and consultants (n = 30; 21%).
Location wise, the highest incidence of NSI was found in the operating room (n = 
94; 67%), followed by the laboratory (n = 17; 12%), and patients' ward (n = 14;
10%). Maximum pricks (n = 10; 20%) occurred while passing sharp instruments,
anterior segment surgeons (n = 23; 79%) being affected more than posterior
segment surgeons (n = 6; 21%). None of the NSI incidents was attributed to
anti-VEGF injections. None of the subjects with NSI had seroconversion to
hepatitis B surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus, or hepatitis C virus
in the 5-year study period.
CONCLUSIONS: NSI is the most commonly encountered in the operating room among
training personnel while passing sharp instruments, especially anterior segment
surgeons. A proper needle/sharp disposal mechanism, documentation of adverse
event, on-going staff training, and prompt prophylactic treatment are essential
components of the protocol for NSI management.
