Dicer-2 is the central player for small interfering RNA biogenesis in the
Drosophila RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Intriguingly, we found that Dicer-2
has an unconventional RNAi-independent function that positively modulates Toll
immune signaling, which defends against Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and some
viruses, in both cells and adult flies. The loss of Dicer-2 expression makes
fruit flies more susceptible to fungal infection. We further revealed that
Dicer-2 posttranscriptionally modulates Toll signaling because Dicer-2 is
required for the proper expression of Toll protein but not for Toll protein
stability or Toll mRNA transcription. Moreover, Dicer-2 directly binds to the 3' 
untranslated region (3'UTR) of Toll mRNA via its PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille)
domain and is required for protein translation mediated by Toll 3'UTR. The loss
of Toll 3'UTR binding activity makes Dicer-2 incapable of promoting Toll
signaling. These data indicate that the interaction between Dicer-2 and Toll mRNA
plays a pivotal role in Toll immune signaling. In addition, we found that Dicer-2
is also required for the Toll signaling induced by two different RNA viruses in
Drosophila cells. Consequently, our findings uncover a novel RNAi-independent
function of Dicer-2 in the posttranscriptional regulation of Toll protein
expression and signaling, indicate an unexpected intersection of the RNAi pathway
and the Toll pathway, and provide new insights into Toll immune signaling,
Drosophila Dicer-2, and probably Dicer and Dicer-related proteins in other
organisms.
