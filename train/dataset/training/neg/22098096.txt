BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a lower prevalence in children and
knowledge is limited regarding the natural outcome of HCV infection in children.
AIM: To study the risk factors of HCV acquisition and predictors of persistence
in Egyptian children.
METHODS: Children, 1-9 years of age, were evaluated for acquisition of HCV
(anti-HCV positive regardless of viraemia) and persistence of HCV (anti-HCV and
HCV-RNA positive) at two paediatric hepatology clinics in Cairo at enrollment and
at 3 monthly intervals. Spontaneous clearance of HCV was defined as ≥ two
positive anti-HCV antibody tests with negative HCV-RNA at least 6 months apart.
RESULTS: Over a 33-month-period a total of 226 children <9 years of age were
screened for HCV antibodies. Of those, 146 (65%) were anti-HCV positive of which 
87 (60%) were HCV-RNA positive. The HCV acquisition was more likely to occur in
older children (P = 0.003) with comorbid conditions (P < 0.01) compared to
anti-HCV negative children. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the
highest risk factors for HCV acquisition were surgical interventions [odds ratio 
(OR): 4.7] and blood transfusions (OR: 2.3). The highest risk factor for HCV
persistence was dental treatment (OR: 16.9) and male gender (OR: 7.5). HCV
persistence was also strongly associated with elevated baseline alanine
aminotransaminase (ALT) levels (OR: 4.9) and fluctuating aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) levels (OR: 8.1).
CONCLUSION: Although surgical interventions and blood transfusion are significant
risk factors for HCV acquisition in Egyptian children, dental treatment remains
the highest risk factor for HCV chronic persistence in children.
