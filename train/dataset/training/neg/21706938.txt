Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by the virus strain H5N1,
currently occurs worldwide with the greatest burden in Southeast Asia where the
disease was first reported. In Thailand where the disease was first confirmed in 
January 2004, the virus had been persistent as a major threat to the poultry
industry and human health over the past several years. It was generally
hypothesized that the main reason for the disease to circulate in Thailand was
the existence of traditional backyard chickens and free-range ducks raising
systems. Consequently, this study reviewed the structure of poultry raising
systems, the recent outbreaks of HPAI H5N1, the disease association to the
backyard and free-grazing poultry production, and consequences of the outbreaks
in Thailand. Although the major outbreaks in the country had declined, the
sustaining disease surveillance and prevention are still strongly recommended.
