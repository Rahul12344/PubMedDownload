OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify whether genital symptoms were associated with
unrecognized herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in a primary care
population.
STUDY DESIGN: Five thousand four hundred fifty-two individuals aged 18 to 59
seeking general care at 36 suburban medical offices in 6 U.S. cities were tested 
for HSV-2 antibody and asked about 10 types of genital symptoms. In patients with
no known history of genital herpes, we assessed whether HSV-2 infection was
independently associated with symptoms.
RESULTS: HSV-2 infection was associated with increases in reports of "sores,
blisters, ulcers, crusts, or small cuts/slits" in men [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 
1.79; 95% CI, 1.24-2.58] and with increases in reports of "redness, irritation,
or a rash" among women (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.06-2.11). HSV-2 was not
significantly associated with other types of genital symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary-care physicians should consider unrecognized HSV-2 infection
as a potential cause of some common genital symptoms.
