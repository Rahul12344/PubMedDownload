High incidence of mammary tumors in mice with inherited asplenia carriers for the
nude gene.

Lozzio BB, Lopez DM, Coulson P, Lair SV.

A colony of mice suffering from dominant hemimelia associated with agenesis of
the spleen has been developed and characterized during the past 7 years. The
hereditarily asplenic (Dh/+) mice have a very low incidence (9%) of spontaneous
mammary tumors (SMT). Asplenic (Dh/+) females were mated with mice homozygous
(nu/nu) for hereditary athymia (nude) having a BALB/c background. BALB/c females 
heterozygous for the nu gene and with spleen (nu/+,+/+) have a moderate incidence
(12%) of SMT, whereas nu/+,Dh/+ breeders have a drastic increase in the incidence
of SMT to 46% when bred under identical conditions. Since all parent strains have
a very low incidence of SMT, it appears that the spleen agenesis is a major
factor accounting for an earlier and higher incidence of SMT in hereditarily
asplenic (nu/+,Dh/+) mice than in normal (nu/+,+/+) siblings. The SMT express
mammary tumor virus antigen(s) and possess estrogen, progesterone, and
glucocorticoid receptors. The SMT rapidly metastasize and kill the host within 30
to 45 days. The BALB/c asplenic mice with SMT represent a unique model relevant
to human breast cancer and for study of the function of the spleen in the
development of solid tumors in general and of SMT in particular.
