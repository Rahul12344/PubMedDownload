Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus, classified
recently into the genus Bocavirus in the family Parvoviridae. A recombinant
baculovirus expression system was used to express the major capsid protein VP2 of
HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4 in insect cells. A large amount of the 61-kDa VP2
capsid protein (p61) of HBoVs was generated and efficiently released into the
supernatant. The capsid protein was self-assembled into 22-nm-dia. virus-like
particles (VLPs) with a buoyant density of 1.30g/cm(3). The morphology of
HBoVs-LPs was similar to that of the native HBoV particles, and immunogenic
studies demonstrated the cross-reactivity among HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4.
When VP1 and VP2 protein of HBoV1 were co-expressed in insect cells, both
proteins were detected in the same fraction after CsCl gradient centrifugation,
suggesting that the VP1 protein is a minor structural protein of HBoVs. We
developed an ELISA using purified VLPs as the antigen and used it to detect
antibodies against HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4. A high prevalence of antibodies
against HBoVs was found in a general population of healthy Japanese, indicating
that HBoVs have spread throughout Japan.
