subtilis].

Savchenko GV, Prozorov AA.

The gene for alpha-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens having a foreign
promoter providing gene expression in logarithmic growth phase and the cat gene
of plasmid pC194 (AC fragment) were inserted into thermoinducible prophage phi
105 cts139. Possibility of amylolytic activity enhancement was studied after
thermoinduction. When AC fragment and random PstI restricts of phage DNA were
ligated and used to transform Bacillus subtilis 1A289 (phi 105 cts139) the Amy+
CmR transformants were obtained having the different levels of increased
amylolytic activity (maximum--26 fold). Numerous phages without insert found in
induced lysates suggest that insertions were unstable and (or) the clones were
double lysogens for hybrid and original type phages. Stable insertion of AC
fragment replacing the PstI-H-fragment of phage DNA revealed that all Amy+ CmR
transformants were double lysogens. Inducibility depended on the insertion
orientation.
