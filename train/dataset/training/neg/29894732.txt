Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging disease caused 
by the SFTS virus (SFTSV) of the family Bunyaviridae. Since the virus was first
isolated in 2009, it has become widespread in China, with an increasing number of
cases year on year. Although the disease has been researched extensively in past 
years, there are still no effective measures to suppress the epidemic situation. 
This article reports a pilot study of comprehensive measures, including health
education and risk communication, weed removal, livestock management, and tick
control, to prevent this emerging disease in an endemic region of China. The
density of ticks decreased dramatically month by month after acaricides were
sprayed in the areas surrounding recreational and agricultural settings. The
number of SFTS cases and villages involved declined in the years after the
integrated measures were applied. Comprehensive measures, especially
community-based tick control, may be a promising means of preventing SFTS in
endemic regions.
