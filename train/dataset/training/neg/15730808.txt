OBJECTIVE: To investigate the HIV-1 nef specific CD8(+) T cell responses in
long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) and AIDS patient in China.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 7 LTNPs and 9
AIDS patients, 12 males and 4 females, aged 37 (27 approximately 55). A panel of 
26 overlapping peptides spanning HIV-1 nef constituting 3 peptide pools was used 
as antigens. The HIV-1 nef specific CD8(+) T cell responses of the LTNPs and AIDS
patients were examined by IFN- ELISPOT assay. The amount of CD4(+) T cell and
viral load were detected. The relationships between HIV-1 nef specific CD8(+) T
cell responses and CD4(+) T cell counts and viral loads were studied.
RESULTS: The strength of HIV-1 nef specific CD8(+) T cell responses of LTNP group
was 404 +/- 33 SFC/10(6) PBMCs, significantly higher than that of the AIDS group 
(59 +/- 121 SFC/10(6) PBMCs). The strength of HIV-1 nef specific CD8(+) T cell
responses was positively correlated with the CD4(+) T cell count. No relationship
between the strength of CD8(+) T cell responses and viral load was found.
CONCLUSION: HIV-1 nef specific CD8(+) T cell responses may play an important role
in preventing disease progression of HIV infection. There is a cross immune
response between the major HIV-1 strains in Europe and those in China.
