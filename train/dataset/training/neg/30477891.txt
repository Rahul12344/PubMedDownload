Synthetic neamine mimetics have been evaluated for binding to the HIV-1 Rev
response element. Modified neamine derivatives, obtained from reductive amination
of neamine, led to identification of new 6-amino modified neamine-type ligands
with HIV-1 RRE binding affinity up to 20× that of neamine and up to 6× that of
the more complex neomycin itself. This provides a noteworthy structure-activity
increase and a useful lead to simplified, chemically accessible mimetics.
