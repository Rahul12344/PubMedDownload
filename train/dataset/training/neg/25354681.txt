Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an RNA surveillance mechanism that requires
upframeshift protein 1 (UPF1). This study demonstrates that human UPF1 exerts
protective effects in a rat paralysis model based on the amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS)-associated protein, TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding
protein 43â€‰kDa). An adeno-associated virus vector (AAV9) was used to express
TDP-43 throughout the spinal cord of rats, inducing reproducible limb paralysis, 
to recapitulate the paralysis in ALS. We selected UPF1 for therapeutic testing
based on a genetic screen in yeast. The expression of human TDP-43 or human UPF1 
in the spinal cord was titrated to less than twofold over the respective
endogenous level. AAV9 human mycUPF1 clearly improved overall motor scores in
rats also expressing TDP-43. The gene therapy effect of mycUPF1 was specific and 
reproducible compared with groups receiving either empty vector or green
fluorescent protein vector controls. The gene therapy maintained forelimb motor
function in rats that would otherwise become quadriplegic. This work helps
validate UPF1 as a novel therapeutic for ALS and other TDP-43-related diseases
and may implicate UPF1 and NMD involvement in the underlying disease mechanisms.
