The human leukemia cell line K562 can be induced by
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to differentiate along the
megakaryocytic pathway, generating morphological changes and increased expression
of lineage-specific surface markers. We report that TPA-treated K562 cells also
express higher levels of FLI-1/ERGB, a member of the ETS family of transcription 
factors. Furthermore, introduction of a retroviral construct expressing human
FLI-1/ERGB into K562 cells induces changes similar to those seen following TPA
treatment, including increased adherence to the surface of the culture vessel and
altered size and morphology. Infected cells exhibit higher levels of the
megakaryocyte marker CD41a and, to a lesser extent, CD49b. These markers, as well
as virally encoded FLI-1/ERGB-specific RNA and protein, are expressed at the
highest levels in the attached cell population, while the growth rate of adherent
cells is reduced, and the fraction of cells in G0-G1 is increased. FLI-1/ERGB
virus-infected cells also exhibit increased expression of hemoglobin, a marker of
erythroid differentiation. Our results suggest FLI-1/ERGB plays a role in
controlling differentiation and gene expression along the megakaryocyte/platelet 
pathway, and further implicate ETS-related genes in the control of multiple
developmentally regulated hematopoietic genes.
