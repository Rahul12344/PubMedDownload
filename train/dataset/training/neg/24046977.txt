The authors propose a therapy consisting of a constant dosage of reverse
transcription inhibitor and protease inhibitor to achieve long-term
non-progressor (LTNP) status in human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) patients.
Based on the authors analyses of cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor (CTLp)
concentration at several equilibrium points and the bifurcation of these
equilibrium points, they find that administration of drugs with an efficacy lower
than a certain level induces a higher CTLp concentration. As a result, drug doses
of moderate efficacy result in more patients with LTNP status than doses with
high efficacy. In analyses of controllability, they show that a treatment of
moderate efficacy is more efficient than one of very high efficacy in terms of
controlling the immune system. Using simulations, they demonstrate that their
proposed method results in LTNP status in HIV patients.
