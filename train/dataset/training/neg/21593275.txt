Our earlier study has demonstrated that hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated
cholesterol plays a key role in virus infectivity. In this study, the structural 
requirement of sterols for infectivity, buoyant density and apolipoprotein
association of HCV was investigated further. We removed cholesterol from virions 
with methyl β-cyclodextrin, followed by replenishment with 10 exogenous
cholesterol analogues. Among the sterols tested, dihydrocholesterol and
coprostanol maintained the buoyant density of HCV and its infectivity, and
7-dehydrocholesterol restored the physical appearance of HCV, but suppressed its 
infectivity. Other sterol variants with a 3β-hydroxyl group or with an aliphatic 
side chain did not restore density or infectivity. We also provide evidence that 
virion-associated cholesterol contributes to the interaction between HCV
particles and apolipoprotein E. The molecular basis for the effects of different 
sterols on HCV infectivity is discussed.
