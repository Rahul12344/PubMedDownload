OBJECTIVES: To determine whether steaming oysters prevents gastroenteritis caused
by small round structured (Norwalk-like) viruses and to identify risk factors for
illness.
METHODS: The authors interviewed all 48 people who ate oysters at two church
suppers that were followed by outbreaks of gastroenteritis from a Norwalk-like
virus. Data were collected on demographics, clinical illness, number of oysters
eaten, and the extent to which they were cooked.
RESULTS: Among the 48 persons, the attack rate was 56%. The risk of illness
increased with the number of oysters eaten (chi-square for trend = 5.7, P =
0.02). There was no decrease in attack rates among persons who ate oysters that
were better done (chi-square for trend = 1.1, P = 0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: In these outbreaks, the risk of illness increased with the number of
oysters eaten. Steaming oysters did not appear to prevent illness, suggesting
that steaming may not be adequate to inactivate small round structured viruses.
Public health messages that have emphasized the role of raw shellfish in the
transmission of enteric viruses should be altered to increase the public's
awareness that eating steamed oysters may also pose health risks.
