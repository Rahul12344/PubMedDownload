Pertussis toxin (PT), which blocks the activity of several G-proteins, has been
found to exert a marked inhibitory effect on the DNA synthesis induced in 3T3
cells by serum or growth factors. 3T3 cells transformed with human c-ras
oncogenes (Ha-ras, Ki-ras, N-ras) or with src, an oncogene coding for a protein
kinase, have lost sensitivity to growth control by PT, even though substrates for
PT can still be ADP-ribosylated in vivo. In contrast, 3T3 cells transformed with 
the SV40 virus behave like normal untransformed cells with respect to the ability
of PT to decrease their growth rate. Oncogenes can thus likely be classified
either as 'responders' or 'non-responders' to PT.
