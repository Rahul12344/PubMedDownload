PURPOSE: To evaluate whether radiological findings and healing time in children
with pneumonia are correlated to etiologic agent.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 346 children with radiologically verified acute 
pneumonia, and with accomplished serological tests for bacteria and viruses, were
included in the study. Five etiological groups were analysed: children with
bacterial etiology only, with viral etiology only, with mixed bacterial and viral
etiology, with Mycoplasma only, and children with no etiology.
RESULTS: The chest films of each etiological group were analysed and the findings
were correlated to the children's age. The radiological findings did not differ
between the etiological groups. Radiological findings correlated significantly
with the patient's age. The radiological healing frequency at check-up X-ray was 
found to be significantly lower in children with mixed bacterial and viral
etiology compared to children in each of the other groups and to the material as 
a whole.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions about the etiology could not be drawn from the chest
X-ray findings.
