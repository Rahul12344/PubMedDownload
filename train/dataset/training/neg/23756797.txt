Rotavirus vaccine is available as an optional vaccine in Malaysia. The
counselling of optional vaccines is considered an integral part of the health
services offered in a private paediatric clinic. While ensuring that all babies
are up-todate with their compulsory immunization, counselling of optional
vaccines like the rotavirus vaccine could give parents the choice to make an
informed decision on the acceptance of this vaccine. Over a period of two years, 
we counselled the parents regarding diarrhoea caused by rotavirus disease and the
rotavirus vaccine. In this study, the factors that were significantly associated 
with the acceptance of the rotavirus vaccine were the gender of the baby, the
mother's age, the mother's occupation, the mode of payment for the vaccine, the
number of previous visits to the clinic by the parents, the number of counselling
sessions given to the parents and the pre-counselling awareness or knowledge of
rotavirus disease and rotavirus vaccine. It is hoped that these findings may
assist busy clinicians in their continuous efforts to provide health education
and vaccination counselling to the parents of their patients.
