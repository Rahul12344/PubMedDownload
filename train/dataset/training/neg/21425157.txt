Repeated infections and experimental prime-boost regimens frequently result in
the generation of secondary (2°) CD8(+) T-cell responses. In contrast to primary 
(1°) CD8(+) T cells, the parameters that influence the abundance and phenotype of
2° effector and memory CD8(+) T-cell populations are largely unknown. Here, we
analyze the impact of different booster infections, Ag curtailment, and systemic 
inflammation on the quality and quantity of secondary CD8(+) T-cell responses. We
show that similar to 1° CD8(+) T-cell responses, the phenotype of 2° effector and
memory CD8(+) T-cell populations is critically dependent on the nature of the
infectious pathogen and the inflammatory milieu early after infection. In
addition, systemic inflammation increases the number of 2° effector and memory
CD8(+) T cells after booster infections and immunizations. Therefore, our data
reveal new means to boost the number of 2° effector and memory CD8(+) T cells in 
prime-boost regimens and show a surprisingly high degree of plasticity in 2°
memory CD8(+) T-cell phenotype that is controlled by systemic inflammation.
