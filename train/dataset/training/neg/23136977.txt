The trends of influenza infection in Suriname were assessed from February 2010
through February 2011. Testing of 393 patients with symptoms of acute respiratory
infection (ARI) revealed 15.3% Influenza B and 18.6% could be identified as
influenza A positive, consisting of 56% influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 44% seasonal
A(H3N2). Influenza infection occurred throughout the year, and all three
influenza types affected young children as the primary population. The annual
incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 was 6.88 per 100,000 inhabitants [CI] 4.87-9.45. The
spread of influenza could neither be linked to tourist flow from the Netherlands 
nor to contact rates related to school schedules.
