BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunocompromised patients can
lead to viremia associated with morbidity and mortality. Monitoring of viral
loads in blood is critical for initiating and monitoring antiviral treatment.
OBJECTIVES: Validate quantitative real-time PCR assay targeting the US17 and UL54
regions of the CMV genome for automated DNA and extraction and amplification.
STUDY DESIGN: 3422 blood specimens from organ transplant recipients, including
longitudinal specimens from 12 organ transplant recipients, were tested by CMV
PCR and pp65 antigenemia.
RESULTS: CMV PCR for both US17 and UL54, was more sensitive and detected CMV DNA 
earlier and for longer than the CMV pp65 antigenemia test. Using antigenemia
results as a reference standard, an optimal cutoff of 500 normalized copies was
calculated for both US17 and UL54 PCR targets based on high sensitivity,
specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. CMV DNA levels tracked 
well with clinical symptoms, response to treatment, and antigenemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of persistent increases in CMV DNA levels above 500
normalized copies by this real-time PCR assay is indicative of symptomatic CMV
disease in organ transplant recipients. Quantitative real-time PCR for CMV DNA
can be used in lieu of antigenemia for monitoring CMV infection and determining
when to initiate preemptive treatment.
