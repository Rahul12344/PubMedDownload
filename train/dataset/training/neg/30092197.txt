Rotavirus vaccines (RVV) protect against childhood gastroenteritis caused by
rotavirus (RV) but have decreased effectiveness in low- and middle-income
settings. This proof-of-concept, randomized-controlled, open-label trial tested
if microbiome modulation can improve RVV immunogenicity. Healthy adults were
randomized and administered broad-spectrum (oral vancomycin, ciprofloxacin,
metronidazole), narrow-spectrum (vancomycin), or no antibiotics and then
vaccinated with RVV, 21 per group per protocol. Baseline anti-RV IgA was high in 
all subjects. Although antibiotics did not alter absolute anti-RV IgA titers, RVV
immunogenicity was boosted at 7 days in the narrow-spectrum group. Further,
antibiotics increased fecal shedding of RV while also rapidly altering gut
bacterial beta diversity. Beta diversity associated with RVV immunogenicity
boosting at day 7 and specific bacterial taxa that distinguish RVV boosters and
RV shedders were identified. Despite the negative primary endpoint, this study
demonstrates that microbiota modification alters the immune response to RVV and
supports further exploration of microbiome manipulation to improve RVV
immunogenicity.
