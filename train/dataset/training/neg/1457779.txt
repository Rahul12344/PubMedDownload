The authors of this study adapted Peters' (1987) community health specifications 
of patients' nursing requirements so they could be applied to patients with
HIV/AIDS in hospital, dedicated outpatient HIV clinic, home care, and long-term
care settings. The authors then collected validity evidence on the revised
specifications, developed a sample of 62 multiple-choice items, and obtained
content-related validity evidence via a judgmental review panel. The results
produced: (a) a set of specifications for the environmental, psychosocial,
physiological, and health behaviors domains; and (b) a 44-item scale of patient
characteristics related to four levels of healthcare needs.
