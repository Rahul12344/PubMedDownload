Drug interactions: trials and tribulations and cocktails.

[No authors listed]

AIDS: People being treated for HIV frequently face drug reactions and
interactions that can be unpleasant, severe, and unpredictable. Combinations of
antiretrovirals and prophylactic medications can cause symptoms that negatively
impact quality of life or alter the effectiveness of some of the medications. In 
addition, people taking recreational drugs or alternative therapies generally
have no guidance in knowing what reactions to expect. Toxicities, suggested
standard dosages, and potential drug interactions are included for the most
common HIV treatments, specifically nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, and 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Drugs that are effected
by food in the stomach and drugs that effect appetite and food intake are listed.
