patients with AIDS.

This study investigated whether immune restoration occurred in 26 human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected children treated first with
indinavir for 16 weeks and then with combination antiretroviral therapy for >2
years. Compared with baseline, a significant, although modest, decrease in virus 
loads (maximum median, -0.86 log(10)) and increase in the number of CD4(+)
lymphocytes, especially naive cells, were observed at several time points after 2
years. A maximum of 7% of treated children achieved undetectable viremia. There
was a marked increase in the proliferative response and skin reactivity to recall
antigens. However, responses to an HIV antigen remained depressed, and the
production of interleukin-12 remained unchanged and abnormally low. The magnitude
of virus suppression did not correlate with these measures of functional immune
reconstitution. These findings suggest that long-term nonsuppressive
antiretroviral therapy can induce limited improvement in immune function in
pediatric AIDS patients and that the effect of suppressive treatments should be
investigated.
