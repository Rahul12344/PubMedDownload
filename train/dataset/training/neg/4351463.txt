Cytomegalovirus replication in cells pretreated with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine.

St Jeor S, Rapp F.

The replication of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) in cells pretreated with
5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR) was studied. Pretreatment of cells with IUdR
enhanced several parameters of virus replication. Virus grown in drug-treated
cells exhibited a shorter eclipse period and the cells produced more infectious
virus sooner than did untreated cells. There was an approximate fivefold increase
in virus yield per cell in the drug-treated samples when compared to control
cultures. The time required for plaque development was shortened by 6 days in
drug-treated cultures. Pretreatment of cells with IUdR also increased plaquing
efficiency of the virus by approximately 10-fold. The enhancement of virus
replication by IUdR was further demonstrated by varying the multiplicity of
infection. In a 7-day period there was a 100-fold increase in sensitivity of the 
cultures for virus detection when the cells had been previously exposed to IUdR. 
The data presented indicate the possibility that IUdR interferes with the
production of a cellular product inhibitory for CMV replication.
