Infection by various viral and bacterial pathogens has long been proposed as one 
of the etiologies of autoimmune diabetes. Many theories, ranging from direct
cytolysis of pancreatic islet cells to immunological processes such as antigen
mimicry and polyclonal lymphocyte activation, tried to explain the
epidemiological correlation between infections and diabetes, supported by
information from human and animal studies. However, a direct correlation and
exact mechanism continue to elude investigators due to scarce and conflicting
data. Interestingly, there is also data to support an opposite role for infection
in the development of type 1 diabetes, as several pathogens demonstrated a
protective effect from this disease. This article reviews the current data
available from clinical studies and animal models, while trying to explain the
different mechanisms underlying these findings.
