OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the rate of influenza immunization in pregnant couples
whose infants required neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and to
clarify predictors for trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) use in this 
targeted parent population.
STUDY DESIGN: During the 2005-07 influenza seasons, parents of NICU patients at
two level III centers were surveyed about TIV after their infant's NICU
admission. Data on immunization history, location of immunization, and other risk
factors for influenza were assessed. Infant data including birth weight,
gestational age, and multiple births were also obtained.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty-six parents had infants in the NICU. Five
hundred and forty-seven (69.5%) were surveyed. The overall parental rate of
vaccination was 23.2% (127/547). The parental vaccination rate did not differ
between years (23.2% vs. 23.2%). Mothers were less likely to have received TIV
prior to delivery than fathers (17.0% vs. 28.4%; p < 0.02). Of the population,
19.3% received immunization from their OB/GYN. A concordance rate of 8.9% was
noted between married couples receiving TIV. More parents received TIV in January
and February of the influenza seasons than November and December (p < 0.05,
Student's t-test). Influenza immunization rate in NICU parents was unrelated to
infant's gestational age, parental age, total number of risk factors for TIV,
hospital length of stay, multiple gestation, or need for high risk obstetrical
care.
CONCLUSIONS: TIV rates among high-risk pregnant parents whose infants are
admitted to NICU are lower than expected compared with the general population.
Patient refusal of influenza vaccine is not a major obstacle toward acceptance.
