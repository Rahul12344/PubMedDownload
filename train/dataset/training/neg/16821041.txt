We have developed Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) as a plant virus vector especially 
for production of pharmaceutical proteins. The CMV vector is a vector modifiable 
for different host plants and does not require further engineering steps. CMV
contains three genomic RNA molecules (RNAs 1-3) necessary for infectivity. With
this system, instead of creating different vector constructs for each plant we
use, we take advantage of the formation of pseudrecombinants between two CMV
isolates by simply reassembling a vector construct (RNA 2 base) and an RNA
molecule containing the host determinant (mostly RNA 3). In this study, the gene 
for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), one of the human cytokines, was
cloned under the control of the subgenomic promoter for RNA 4A of the CMV-based
vector, C2-H1. Infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants produced aFGF at levels up
to 5-8% of the total soluble protein. The tobacco-produced aFGF was purified, and
its biological activity was confirmed. Using this system, which provides a
versatile and viable strategy for the production of therapeutic proteins in
plants, we also demonstrated a high level of aFGF in Glycine max (soybean) and
Arabidopsis thaliana.
