PURPOSE: Clinical course and autopsy findings in a patient with human
immunodeficiency virus-1 immunodeficiency, central nervous system lymphoma, and
bilateral, simultaneous ophthalmic artery occlusions.
DESIGN: Observational case report.
METHODS: Clinical examination, fundus photography, gross and microscopic
pathologic study.
RESULTS: Fundus photographs disclosed stasis in retinal arterioles, the absence
of a cherry-red spot; internal carotid arteriography disclosed bilateral
ophthalmic artery occlusions; postmortem histopathologic examination disclosed
bilateral ophthalmic artery atherosclerosis, retinal ischemic necrosis, ischemic 
optic neuropathy, diffuse large-cell lymphoma of multiple areas of the central
nervous system, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, atherosclerosis, and
bronchopneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: A 47-year-old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, profound
immunodeficiency, systemic hypertension, and central nervous system lymphoma,
developed deep vein thrombosis, bilateral ophthalmic artery occlusions, and died 
of pneumonia 7 weeks after the onset of blindness. Postmortem study revealed
bilateral ophthalmic artery hemorrhagic atherosclerosis, ischemic optic
neuropathy, ischemic retinal necrosis, diffuse large-cell central nervous system 
lymphoma, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, pneumonitis, and systemic
atherosclerosis.
