Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a highly contagious Paramyxovirus
that infects most children by age two, generating an estimated 75,000-125,000
hospitalizations in the U.S. annually. hRSV is the most common cause of
bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants and children under 1year of age, with
significant mortality among high-risk groups. A regulatory agency-approved
vaccine is not available, and existing prophylaxis and therapies are limited to
use in high-risk pediatric patients; thus additional therapies are sorely needed.
Here, we identify a series of benzimidazole analogs that inhibit hRSV infection
in vitro with high potency, using a previously-reported high-throughput screening
assay. The lead compound, SRI 29365
(1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3-yl]methyl-1H-benzimidazo
le), has an EC50 of 66μM and a selectivity >50. We identified additional
compounds with varying potencies by testing commercially-available chemical
analogs. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRI 29365 effectively
inhibits viral replication only if present during the early stages of viral
infection. We isolated a virus with resistance to SRI 29365 and identified
mutations in the transmembrane domain of the viral G protein genomic sequence
that suggested that the compound inhibits G-protein mediated attachment of hRSV
to cells. Additional experiments with multiple cell types indicated that SRI
29365 antiviral activity correlates with the binding of cell surface heparin by
full-length G protein. Lastly, SRI 29365 did not reduce hRSV titers or
morbidity/mortality in efficacy studies using a cotton rat model. Although SRI
29365 and analogs inhibit hRSV replication in vitro, this work suggests that the 
G-protein may not be a valid drug target in vivo.
