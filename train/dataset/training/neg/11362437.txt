AIDS: People living with AIDS may expect too much from others and block out
initiatives which imply personal responsibility. They may be in denial and
continue sexual activities without protection, adding to the spread of the virus 
and risking greater infection. Also, they may not be aware of the responsibility 
that living with AIDS carries, nor have the tools to confront it. This is life's 
greatest responsibility as it involves people's moral conscience. Some look to
religion, praying for a cure or vaccine. Solutions do not come easily. It is
imperative that people start by first loving and valuing themselves. Support
groups which offer hope and love of life can be crucial at this time and should
be sought out.
