Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a powerful predictor of survival for
individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The purpose of this
cross-sectional study conducted in December 2007 was to assess ART adherence and 
identify its determinants in HIV-infected patients in Sousse, Tunisia. Adherence 
was evaluated in a structured interview, during which questions were asked about 
the number of pills taken, treatment schedule, and any food restrictions within
the previous 4 days. Determinants of adherence included patient characteristics, 
type of ART, and interpersonal relationships and were assessed from the medical
records and questionnaire responses. Adherence was assessed in 30 of the 34
patients receiving ART at the time of the study. Twenty-two patients (73%)
complied with all daily treatment recommendations and were considered adherent.
Multivariate analysis showed that the main barriers to adherence were related to 
storage of the medication and doubts about its efficacy. Improvement of
socioeconomic conditions and better psychosocial support are needed to optimize
ART adherence by HIV-infected patients in Tunisia.
