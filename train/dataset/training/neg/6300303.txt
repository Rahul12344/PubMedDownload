Host defence mechanisms against Japanese encephalitis virus infection in mice.

Mathur A, Arora KL, Chaturvedi UC.

The role of antibody and cell-mediated immunity in the resistance to Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) infection was studied in adult mice. Passively
transferred antibodies obtained up to 2 weeks after primary infection protected
the recipient mice against a challenge infection with JEV. Antibody obtained at 4
or 5 weeks failed to protect despite the presence of high titres of neutralizing 
antibody. Protection was abrogated by pretreatment of the early serum with
2-mercaptoethanol to remove IgM. Similarly, adoptive transfer of immune spleen
cells obtained up to 2 weeks after immunization provided protection. The
protective effect was abolished by pretreatment of the immune spleen cells with
anti-Thy 1.2 antiserum and complement. These findings suggest a role of T
lymphocytes and IgM antibody in recovery from JEV infection.
