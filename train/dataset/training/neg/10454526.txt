Retroviral-mediated expression of the P140A, but not P140A/G156A, mutant form of 
O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase protects hematopoietic cells against
O6-benzylguanine sensitization to chloroethylnitrosourea treatment.

O(6)-Benzylguanine (6-BG) inactivates mammalian O(6)-methylguanine DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT), an important DNA repair protein that protects cells
against chloroethylnitrosourea (CENU) cytotoxicity. 6-BG is being tested as an
approach to treat CENU-resistant tumors that overexpress endogenous MGMT.
However, in addition to restoring CENU tumor cell sensitivity, 6-BG also
increases the cytotoxic effects of CENUs on hematopoietic cells. Several
6-BG-resistant human MGMT mutants have been characterized in Escherichia coli and
are predicted to protect mammalian cells against the combination of 6-BG and CENU
treatment in vivo. Two mutants, P140A and P140A/G156A, demonstrated 20- and
1200-fold more resistance to 6-BG depletion of MGMT activity compared with
wild-type MGMT (WTMGMT). Here, we analyzed retroviral vectors that express either
WTMGMT, the P140A or P140A/G156A mutant forms of MGMT. Retroviral-infected L1210 
hematopoietic cells demonstrated similar levels of RNA in all transduced clones. 
However, the amount of MGMT protein and DNA repair activity was reduced in clones
expressing the P140A/G156A mutant compared with those expressing WTMGMT or P140A.
Expression of P140A was associated with a 4- to 8-fold increase in resistance to 
6-BG depletion of MGMT in transduced L1210 clones and a 1,
3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea IC(50) of 50 microM (compared with 27.5 microM
for WTMGMT) in primary murine hematopoietic cells. These results demonstrate the 
utility of screening 6-BG-resistant MGMT proteins in hematopoietic cells and
provide evidence that the P140A mutant form of MGMT generates 6-BG- and
CENU-resistant hematopoietic cells. Retrovirus vectors expressing this mutant may
be useful in future human gene therapy trials.
