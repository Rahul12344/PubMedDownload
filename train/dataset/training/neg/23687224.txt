BACKGROUND: Microbial translocation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. We sought to determine whether markers of microbial
translocation are associated with liver disease progression during coinfection
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
METHODS: We measured serial plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS), endotoxin core
antibody, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), soluble CD14 (sCD14),
interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels 
over a 5-year period in 44 HIV/HCV-coinfected women, 21 of whom experienced liver
disease progression and 23 were nonprogressors.
RESULTS: While LPS levels did not differ significantly over time between
progressors and nonprogressors (P = .60), progressors had significantly higher
plasma levels of sCD14, a marker of monocyte activation by LPS, at the first time
point measured (P = .03) and throughout the study period (P = .001); progressors 
also had higher IL-6 and I-FABP levels over the 5-year study period (P = .02 and 
.03, respectively). The associations between progression and sCD14, I-FABP, and
IL-6 levels were unchanged in models controlling for HIV RNA and CD4(+) T-cell
count.
CONCLUSIONS: Although LPS levels did not differ between liver disease progressors
and nonprogressors, the association of sCD14, I-FABP, and IL-6 levels with liver 
disease progression suggests that impairment of gut epithelial integrity and
consequent microbial translocation may play a role in the complex interaction of 
HIV and HCV pathogenesis.
