OBJECTIVE: Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive facultative anaerobic
bacterium, which is present in 30-89% of teeth with postendodontic treatment
failures. E. faecalis is capable of penetrating dentinal tubules and surviving as
a monoculture after conventional endodontic therapy, indicating that it is
resistant to commonly used endodontic disinfection protocols. Different E.
faecalis strains have shown resistance to several antibiotics, and have been
associated with both dental pathology and systemic infections. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the efficacy of a genetically engineered bacteriophage to
disinfect dentin infected with antibiotic resistant strains of E. faecalis.
METHODS: Extracted human dentin root segments were cemented into sealable
two-chamber devices, fabricated from syringe needle caps to form in vitro
infected-dentin models. The models were inoculated with an overnight suspension
of either E. faecalis V583 (vancomycin resistant strain) or E. faecalis JH2-2
(fusidic acid and rifampin resistant, vancomycin sensitive strain). After 7days
of incubation at 37°C, a suspension of a genetically engineered phage,
ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA, was added to the root canal of each infected dentin
segment, and the incubation was continued for an additional 72-h. Dentin was
harvested from the walls of each root canal and assayed for the residual titer of
E. faecalis cells.
RESULTS: The recovered E. faecalis titer was reduced by 18% for the JH2-2
infected models, and by 99% for the V583 infected models.
CONCLUSION: Treatment: of E. faecalis-infected dentin with bacteriophage
ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA consistently resulted in a decrease in the residual
bacterial population of both vancomycin-sensitive and resistant strains.
