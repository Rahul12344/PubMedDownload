We constructed and expressed different overlapping fusion proteins with the nef
gene of HIV-1 and generated specific polyclonal rabbit and monoclonal mouse
antibodies against these recombinant proteins. The rabbit antisera, one of the
monoclonal antibodies as well as a serum from a HIV-1 infected patient recognized
the nef protein with Mr 27 kDa in latently HIV-1 infected glioma cells in the
immunoblot. In contrast, these antibodies could not detect nef in productively
HIV-1 infected Molt-3 cells neither in immunoblot nor in indirect
immunofluorescence assays. These results indicate the possible participation of
nef in viral latency. The recombinant nef proteins were used as probes for
anti-nef antibodies in human sera. We observed in 17 of 57 sera tested specific
anti-nef antibodies. All of these anti-nef positive sera also contained
antibodies directed against viral structural proteins. The NH2-terminal region of
the recombinant nef was shown to be the major immunodominant antigenic site in
the immunoblot assay.
