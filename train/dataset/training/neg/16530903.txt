The paper uses interviews and observational data gathered among a group of UK
scientists and civil servants responsible for managing a study examining the
possible transmission to humans of Borna disease virus (BDV), a disease primarily
of farm animals. From a science and technology studies perspective, the paper
examines the social processes whereby this scientific problem (possible human
transmission) was constituted as a worthy topic of scientific investigation, came
to receive funding, and was subjected to independent review. It appears that BDV 
research displays only some of the characteristics of 'post-normal science' with 
little participation by extended peer communities. Civil servants and scientists 
reported social interests that were complex and both fractionated and
cross-occupational. An important motivation for engaging in the research was the 
need to maintain investment in pre-existing scientific resources (assay
development, virus stocks and an existing epidemiological cohort). In respect of 
translation theory, influence was a two-way street, with civil servants eager to 
enrol scientists and represent the interests of science, and with scientists
presenting themselves as defenders of the public good. Despite the dynamic
character of scientific debate, the 'career' of BDV investigation appears to have
ended in disengagement, rather than closure.
