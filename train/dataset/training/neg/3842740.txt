[Characteristics of virion formation during mixed infection with influenza
viruses A and B].

[Article in Russian]

Sklianskaia EI, Amvros'eva TV, Kaverin NV.

Simultaneous infection of MDCK cells with influenza A and B viruses at an equal
multiplicity of infection leads to the synthesis of the proteins of both viruses.
In the population of virions the hemagglutinin of influenza B virus prevails,
whereas NP proteins of both viruses are present in similar quantities. Trypsin
treatment of the double-infected cells resulting in the cleavage of the
hemagglutinin molecules at the cell surface allows revealing the predominance of 
influenza B hemagglutinin on cell surface, although both hemagglutinins are
accumulated in the cells. An impairment of the hemagglutinin transport to the
cell surface as a possible additional mechanism of heterotypic interference and
its possible effect on the polypeptide content of the phenotypically mixed
virions are discussed.
