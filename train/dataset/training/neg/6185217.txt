Comparison of the tissue distribution of reverse transcriptase, p30 and type-C
virus in a gibbon ape with lymphocytic leukemia.

Saxinger C, Schetters H.

Tissues obtained at necropsy from a 7 year old male gibbon ape with malignant
lymphoma and leukemia were analyzed by electron microscopic, immunological and
enzymological techniques to determine the comparative localization of tumor cells
and virus throughout the body. In general, the different assays correlated well; 
the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay and p30 radioimmunoassay (RIA) being the
most sensitive, although the RT assay was able to detect activity in one tissue
scored negative by p30 RIA. Tissues were infiltrated with tumor cells to varying 
degrees which correlated well with the level of virus markers in most cases with 
the exception of the liver and kidney. In these 2 organs there was marked
infiltration of free virus and tumor cells but there was no evidence of virus
infection or production by these cells.
