A sensitive and reproducible method has been developed for the measurement of the
silicon phthalocyanine Pc 4 in red blood cell concentrates (RBCC). The procedure 
involves extraction of the RBCC with acetonitrile, purification of the extracts
with reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and determination of Pc 4 in the
extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a reversed-phase 
C18 column. The detection limit with 1-ml RBCC samples is 2 ng. This method is
applicable to monitoring Pc 4 during its use as a photosensitizer for the
inactivation of viruses in RBCC prior to transfusion. It has the potential to be 
adapted for measuring Pc 4 in tissues during its use in photodynamic therapy of
cancer.
