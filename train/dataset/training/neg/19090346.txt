Expressions of several genes in bacteria were carried out by independent
promoter. However, in case of eukaryotes ribosome skipping and introduction of
IRES are employed as alternative to multiple translation initiation. Foot and
mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide has been widely used for co-expression of
multiple genes in eukaryotic, plant and mammalian systems. The 18 amino acid 2A
peptide of FMDV facilitates efficient co-translational dissociation of the
polyprotein into discrete protein products. To study the role of 2A in multimeric
protein production a construct consisting of tandem repeat of 4 units of C-
terminal VP1 linked through 2A sequence was made and expressed in E. coli. Along 
with tetramer protein, trimer, dimer and monomer proteins were produced.
Stability studies showed that the tetramer protein was cleaved to smaller monomer
on storage. The results provide scope for using FMDV 2A for expressing multiple
genes under a single promoter in prokaryotes.
