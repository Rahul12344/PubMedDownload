AIM: To characterize antiviral therapy eligibility among hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-infected adults at a university hospital in Zambia.
METHODS: Hepatitis B surface antigen-positive adults (n = 160) who were
HIV-negative and referred to the hospital after a routine or clinically-driven
HBV test were enrolled. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate
Aminotransferase (AST), platelet count, hepatitis B e-antigen, and HBV DNA were
measured. Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis was assessed by physical examination,
AST-to-platelet ratio index, and transient elastography. In antiviral
therapy-naïve individuals, we described HBV stages and antiviral therapy
eligibility per World Health Organization (WHO) and by HBV test (routine vs
clinical). Elevated ALT was > 19 in women and > 30 U/L in men. Among
treatment-experienced individuals, we described medication side effects,
adherence, and viral suppression.
RESULTS: The median age was 33 years, 71.9% were men, and 30.9% were diagnosed
with HBV through a clinically-driven test with the remainder identified via
routine testing (at the blood bank, community events, etc.). Among 120
treatment-naïve individuals, 2.5% were categorized as immune tolerant, 11.7% were
immune active, 35.6% were inactive carriers, and 46.7% had an indeterminate
phenotype. Per WHO guidelines, 13 (10.8%) were eligible for immediate antiviral
therapy. The odds of eligibility were eight times higher for those diagnosed at
clinical vs routine settings (adjusted odds ratio, 8.33; 95%CI: 2.26-29.41).
Among 40 treatment-experienced HBV patients, virtually all took tenofovir, and a 
history of mild side effects was reported in 20%. Though reported adherence was
good, 12 of 29 (41.4%) had HBV DNA > 20 IU/mL.
CONCLUSION: Approximately one in ten HBV-monoinfected Zambians were eligible for 
antivirals. Many had indeterminate phenotype and needed clinical follow-up.
