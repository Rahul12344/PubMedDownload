BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of folate status on cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) progression and its relationship with high-risk
human papillomavirus (hrHPV).
SUBJECTS/METHODS: We evaluated 20 000 sexually active women aged <65 years in
Yangqu County by using a questionnaire; the subjects were also screened using the
ThinPrep cytologic test (TCT). Patients with abnormal TCT results (other than
glandular cell abnormalities) who were willing to provide informed consent were
further diagnosed using colposcopy and histopathological examination. We
investigated 247 cases of low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions
(LSIL), 125 cases of high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) 
and 877 controls. A 24-item food frequency questionnaire was filled out by the
investigator to estimate the consumption of dietary folate. Positivity for hrHPV 
from residual exfoliated cervical cells was tested; serum folate was also
measured.
RESULTS: The hrHPV infection rate in HSIL patients (77.6%) was higher than that
in LSIL (33.2%) and control (32.0%) patients. Dietary folate intakes in controls,
LSIL and HSIL were 306.9±176.6, 321.8±168.0 and 314.7±193.8 μg/kcal,
respectively. The levels of serum folate in controls, LSIL and HSIL were
18.2±7.9, 15.9±7.1 and 14.3±7.5 nmol/l, respectively. Increased CIN correlated
with higher rates of hrHPV infection and lower levels of serum folate.
CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of serum folate may increase the risk of CIN progression.
Furthermore, potential synergy may exist between low serum folate levels and
hrHPV infection to promote CIN development.
