Antigenic relationship between human and simian rotaviruses.

Schoub BD, Lecatsas G, Prozesky OW.

The simian rotavirus, SA 11, and the murine rotavirus, EDIM, were investigated
for antigenic relatedness to the human rotavirus, by immunoelectron-microscopy.
These studies led to the recognition of two types of rotavirus antibody. One
agglutinated "rough" virus particles only and was group-reactive; it appears to
be widely distributed in various animal species, including human infants. The
second antibody agglutinated "smooth" virus particles and was more
species-specific, demonstrating only a one-way cross-reaction between the simian 
and human viruses; it was found only in convalescent-phase human sera and in
hyperimmune rabbit sera and is probably protective. The simian rotavirus is easy 
to propagate in primary cell culture and in cell lines and should prove useful
for serodiagnosis of human gastroenteritis. It may be a candidate for
immunoprophylaxis.
