Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder that impacts on social
functioning and quality of life, and there is accumulating evidence that
inflammation is a potential pathogenic mechanism of schizophrenia. However, the
mechanism of inflammation possibly occurred in schizophrenia has not been well
understood. The endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1 and inflammatory marker 
CRP are both abnormally expressed in schizophrenia patients. CRP is one of the
markers of bacterial infection generally. Less clear is whether virus or viral
protein can trigger the activation of CRP. Here, we detected a robust increase of
the levels of syncytin-1 and CRP in schizophrenia patients, and displayed a
positive correlation and marked consistency between expressions of syncytin-1 and
CRP in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, overexpression of syncytin-1
significantly elevated the levels of CRP, TLR3, and IL-6 in both human microglia 
and astrocytes. TLR3 deficiency impaired the expressions of CRP and IL-6 induced 
by syncytin-1. Importantly, we observed a cellular co-localization and a direct
interaction between syncytin-1 and TLR3. Additionally, knockdown of IL-6
inhibited the syncytin-1-induced CRP expression. Thus, the totality of these
results showed that viral protein syncytin-1 could trigger the activation of CRP,
which might explain the elevated CRP in sterile inflammation and exhibit a novel 
mechanism for regulation of inflammation by syncytin-1 in schizophrenia.
