This work describes the application of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-capillary gel
electrophoresis (SDS-CGE) method for the analysis of triple 2/6/7 and
double-layered 2/6 rotavirus-like particles (RLPs), candidate vaccines against
rotavirus infection. SDS-CGE analysis of RLPs resulted in peaks that could be
attributed to the viral proteins (VP2, VP6 and VP7) according to their apparent
molecular mass (MWapp). Samples containing the glycoprotein VP7 were analysed
after deglycosylation with PNGase F. Upon deglycosylation, VP7 MWapp decreased
4-7kDa consistent with a degree of glycosylation of approximately 12-21%. VP2 was
eventually detected in the form of more than one related proteins, despite the
small areas due to the relative low mass proportion of this protein in the
particle (16%). The effect of analytical parameters such as capillary temperature
on method performance was evaluated. MWapp values estimated by SDS-CGE were
compared with values obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry. The method described in this work proved to be fast,
consistent and reproducible, representing a feasible alternative to the laborious
conventional electrophoresis for the characterization of RLPs.
