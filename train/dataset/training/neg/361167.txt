Influence of genital herpes on results of fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorption test.

Chapel T, Jeffries CD, Brown WJ, Stewart JA.

Both the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTS-ABS) test and Venereal
Disease Laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis were performed routinely on 113 men
with histories of genital ulcerations. The difference in negative VDRL and
borderline FTS-ABS results between patients with and without herpes simplex virus
in their genital ulcers and no evidence of previous or untreated syphilis was not
statistically significant. Furthermore, use of the FTA-ABS test as a confirmatory
rather than a screening test eliminates false-positive, borderline, or reactive
results in patients with non-syphilitic ulcers.
