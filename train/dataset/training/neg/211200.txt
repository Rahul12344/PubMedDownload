Reversion of temperature sensitive transformation mutants of Rous sarcoma virus
and its effect on the expression of tumour specific surface antigen.

Wyke JA, Kurth R.

Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) mutants, which bear temperature sensitive (ts) defects
in both the maintenance of cell transformation and the expression of tumour
specific cell surface antigen(s) (TSSA), have yielded a number of revertants. In 
seven revertants studied, the acquisition of wild type transforming capacities is
always accompanied by a wild type TSSA expression. This strongly indicates that
transformation and TSSA expression in RSV are affected by the same mutation.
