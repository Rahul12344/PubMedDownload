Influenza viruses in birds: rapid identification by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.

Lecomte J, Berthiaume L, Boudreault A.

Counterimmunoelectrophoresis with an antiserum raised in rabbits against the M
protein of the avian N virus proved to be particularly useful for large-scale
identification of influenza A virus isolates. Of a total of 231 hemagglutinating 
agents isolated from 1,656 rectal swabs collected from shore and open-country
birds, 158 could be identified as influenza A viruses by
counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and 75 were serologically related to Newcastle
disease virus by hemagglutination inhibition with an antiserum to Newcastle
disease virus. Two isolates contained a mixture of influenza A virus and
Newcastle disease virus; although the Newcastle disease virus virus particles
outnumbered the influenza A virus particles in a ratio of 1,000:1, as seen by
electron microscopy, the latter could be readily detected by
counterimmunoelectrophoresis. This type of assay appears to be of potential use
for epidemiological surveillance of influenza virus isolated from humans and
animals. It combines specificity, sensitivity, and simplicity.
