The human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) fusion (F) protein is important for 
HRSV infection, but few studies have examined the genetic diversity of the F gene
from Chinese samples. In this study, a total of 330 HRSV F sequences collected
from different regions of China between 2003 and 2014 were analyzed to understand
their genetic characteristics. In addition, these sequences were compared with
1150 HRSV F sequences in Genbank from 18 other countries. In phylogenetic
analysis, Chinese HRSV F sequences sorted into a number of clusters containing
sequences from China as well as other countries. F sequences from different
genotypes (as determined based on the G gene sequences) within a HRSV subgroup
could be found in the same clusters in phylogenetic trees generated based on F
gene sequences. Amino acid analysis showed that HRSV F sequences from China and
other countries were highly conserved. Of interest, F protein sequences from all 
Chinese samples were completely conserved at the palivizumab binding site, thus
predicting the susceptibility of these strains to this neutralizing antibody. In 
conclusion, HRSV F sequences from China between 2003 and 2014, similar to those
from other countries, were highly conserved.
