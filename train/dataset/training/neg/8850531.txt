We have expressed the human thiopurine methyltransferase cDNA in a baculovirus
vector in Sf21 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells. This system expresses the enzyme at
levels such that the thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme may be readily
visualised by Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. The expressed enzyme catalysed the methylation of
6-mercaptopurine with an apparent Km of 892 microM, similar to that observed in
human liver cytosol ie. 657 microM however, the Vmax was 13,500 pmole/mg/min,
which is approximately 400 times higher than the Vmax observed in human liver
cytosol ie. 33 pmole/mg/min. The thiopurine methyltransferase inhibitors
6-thioxanthine, p-methoxybenzoic acid and 3,5-dimethoxy benzoic acid were found
to be potent inhibitors of the expressed enzyme.
