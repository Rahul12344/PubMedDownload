CD8 T cells are involved in pathogen clearance and infection-induced pathology in
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Studying bulk responses masks the
contribution of individual CD8 T cell subsets to protective immunity and
immunopathology. In particular, the roles of subdominant responses that are
potentially beneficial to the host are rarely appreciated when the focus is on
magnitude instead of quality of response. Here, by evaluating CD8 T cell
responses in CB6F1 hybrid mice, in which multiple epitopes are recognized, we
found that a numerically subdominant CD8 T cell response against DbM187 epitope
of the virus matrix protein expressed high avidity TCR and enhanced signaling
pathways associated with CD8 T cell effector functions. Each DbM187 T effector
cell lysed more infected targets on a per cell basis than the numerically
dominant KdM282 T cells, and controlled virus replication more efficiently with
less pulmonary inflammation and illness than the previously well-characterized
KdM282 T cell response. Our data suggest that the clinical outcome of viral
infections is determined by the integrated functional properties of a variety of 
responding CD8 T cells, and that the highest magnitude response may not
necessarily be the best in terms of benefit to the host. Understanding how to
induce highly efficient and functional T cells would inform strategies for
designing vaccines intended to provide T cell-mediated immunity.
