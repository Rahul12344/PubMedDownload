SETTING: The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays
(IGRAs) are used as supportive evidence to diagnose active tuberculosis (TB).
Novel IGRAs could improve diagnosis, but data are lacking in young children.
DESIGN: Children (age 5 years) with suspected TB were prospectively screened at 
a tertiary hospital in Pune, India; the children underwent TST, and standard
(early secretory antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10) and enhanced
(five additional novel antigens) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays.
RESULTS: Of 313 children (median age 30 months) enrolled, 92% had received
bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination, 53% were malnourished and 9% were coinfected
with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 48 (15%) had TB, 128 (41%) did not, 
and TB could not be ruled out in 137 (44%). The sensitivity of enhanced (45%) and
standard (42%) ELISpot assays for diagnosing TB was better than that of TST (20%)
(P  0.03); however, enhanced ELISpot was not more sensitive than the standard
ELISpot assay (P = 0.50). The specificity of enhanced ELISpot, standard ELISpot
and TST was respectively 82% (95%CI 74-89), 88% (95%CI 81-94) and 98% (95%CI
93-100). Rv3879c and Rv3615c, previously reported to be promising antigens,
failed to improve the diagnostic performance of the ELISpot assay.
CONCLUSION: The TST and the standard and novel ELISpot assays performed poorly in
diagnosing active TB among young children in India.
