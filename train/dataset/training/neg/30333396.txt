Objective Regional disparities were observed in the outcomes of interferon
(IFN)-based therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a Japanese
nationwide study. However, whether or not these regional disparities are observed
in the outcomes of direct-acting antiviral drugs, including sofosbuvir (SOF) plus
ribavirin (RBV) therapy, remains unclear. Methods We conducted a multicenter
study to assess the efficacy of SOF plus RBV therapy for HCV genotype 2 infection
in Tochigi Prefecture and its vicinity, in which IFN-based therapy yielded a low 
sustained virologic response (SVR) rate. In addition, we divided Tochigi
Prefecture into six regions to examine regional disparities in the SVR. Patients 
We enrolled patients with chronic HCV genotype 2 infection. Results Of the 583
patients enrolled, 569 (97.6%) completed the treatment, and 566 (97.1%) also
complied with post-treatment follow-up for 12 weeks. The overall SVR12 rate was
96.1% by per protocol and 93.7% by intention-to-treat analyses. No marked
differences were observed in the SVR12 between subjects â‰¥65 and <65 years of age.
Although large gaps were observed in the characteristics of patients and
accessibility to medical resources, there was no significant difference in the
SVR12 rate among the six regions in Tochigi Prefecture. Conclusion SOF plus RBV
therapy was effective for HCV genotype 2 infection in an area where IFN-based
therapy had previously shown unsatisfactory results. In addition, no regional
disparities in the SVR12 were observed in Tochigi Prefecture.
