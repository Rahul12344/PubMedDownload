Using the technique of in situ hybridisation, we extended our initial studies of 
the occurrence of canine distemper and measles virus in Paget's disease. Bone
samples from untreated patients and patients treated with
3-amino-hydroxypropylidene 1,1 bisphosphonate pamidronate (APD) were examined for
canine distemper nucleocapsid (CDV-N), measles nucleocapsid (MV-N), respiratory
syncytial virus fusion (RSV-F), and simian virus 5 haemoglutinin-neuraminidase
(SV5-HN) sequences using 35S-labelled sense and antisense riboprobes. Only CDV-N 
mRNA was detected in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and mononuclear cells. In
untreated Paget's patients, 63.5% were found to have CDV sequences residing in
bone cells, and 48.2% of those undergoing APD treatment were still found to have 
the viral sequences. RSV-F mRNA was only found in one patient. None of the other 
paramyxoviruses tested were detected. This study shows that CDV can infect a
human host and may be an aetiological agent of Paget's disease of bone.
