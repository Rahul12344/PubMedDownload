We have determined the mechanism of neutralization of influenza virus infectivity
by three antihemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies, the structures of which we have
analyzed before as complexes with hemagglutinin. The antibodies differ in their
sites of interaction with hemagglutinin and in their abilities to interfere in
vitro with its two functions of receptor binding and membrane fusion. We
demonstrate that despite these differences all three antibodies neutralize
infectivity by preventing virus from binding to cells. Neutralization occurs at
an average of one antibody bound per four hemagglutinins, a ratio sufficient to
prevent the simultaneous receptor binding of hemagglutinins that is necessary to 
attach virus to cells.
