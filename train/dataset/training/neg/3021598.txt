Immunohistochemical demonstration of papillomavirus antigen in cervical dysplasia
and vulvar condyloma.

Toki T, Oikawa N, Tase T, Satoh S, Wada Y, Yajima A.

Biopsies from 30 cases of vulvar condyloma, 460 cases of cervical dysplasia, 30
cases of carcinoma in situ and 75 cases of invasive carcinoma of the cervix were 
screened for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) antigen by means of the
peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Positive reaction for HPV was detected in 14
cases of condyloma and 80 cases of dysplasia as a brown intranuclear precipitate 
in the superficial layer of the epithelium. None of the cases of carcinoma in
situ and invasive cancer were positive for HPV. The mean age of the women with
HPV-positive dysplasia was significantly lower than that of the women with
HPV-negative dysplasia. Condylomatous dysplasia showed a significantly higher
positive rate than did noncondylomatous dysplasia. Cases of condylomatous
dysplasia with severe stromal inflammation were negative for HPV more frequently 
than those with mild stromal inflammation.
