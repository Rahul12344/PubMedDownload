Presenting a study about Human Papillomavirus (HPV) determination by
immunohistochemistry and "in situ" hybridization, in 25 samples of squamous cell 
papillomata (15 tonsilar and 10 laryngeal lesions). Five cases resulted positive 
for HPV: 2 of them for immunohistochemical probes, other 2 for "in situ"
hybridization and only 1 cas showed its positivity for both techniques. All these
samples belonging to laryngeal cases. No significant differences were found in
antecedents, clinical and histological features related with results obtained.
Two patients developed a laryngeal carcinoma after papilloma and they had
positive "in situ" hybridization. Literature about diagnosis of HPV-infection was
revised.
