The pathogenicity of avian mycoplasmas.

Stipkovits L.

Based on literature data and own experiences the author gives an outlook about
pathogenicity of avian mycoplasmas. In chickens and turkeys M. gallisepticum and 
M. synoviae (in addition to it M. meleagridis exclusively in turkeys) are the
most important mycoplasmas producing respiratory disease, inflamation of synovial
membranes and other lesions. Their pathogenic effect is very much influenced by
dose of agent, route of entry of microorganism, age of birds, virulence and
tropism of organism as well as associated other mycoplasma or virus or bacterial 
or fungal infections and conditions of environment. These facts rise difficulties
in serological diagnostic and erradication program. Recently ureaplasma infection
was also established in chickens and turkeys which can also be associated with
respiratory disease. From ducks A. laidlawii, M. anatis and various unclassified 
strains were isolated, among these M. anatis and unclassified arginine splitting 
mycoplasma strains proved to be pathogenic. In geese M. gallinarum, A. laidlawii 
and A. axanthum were detected. A. axanthum showed pathogenicity for goslings and 
goose embryos. Its effect is exacerbated by associated parvovirus infection.
