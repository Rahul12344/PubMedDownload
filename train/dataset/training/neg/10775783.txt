The objective of this study was to determine if interleukin (IL)-12 can focus an 
antigen specific type 1 immune response characterized by activation of Th1
lymphocytes and production of IgG2 antibodies in vivo. Saanen goats co-immunized 
with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing caprine IL-12 (rRB-IL12) and the
caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) envelope (env) gene (rWR-63) were
evaluated for development of immune responses to the CAEV env encoded surface
glycoprotein (SU). Immune responses were defined by: (i) SU antibody titers; (ii)
the ratio of SU IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies; (iii) interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and
IL-4 gene expression and proliferative response of SU stimulated lymph node
mononuclear cells (LNMC). Apart from enhancement of IFNgamma and IL-4 gene
expression in SU stimulated LNMC, rRB-IL12 did not affect the immune response to 
rWR-63 encoded SU. Thus, localized production of exogenous species specific IL-12
at the site of immunization did not focus initial priming of antigen reactive Th 
lymphocytes. These results are in contrast to previous studies using inbred mice 
and raise questions regarding the use of cytokine adjuvants to focus immune
responses in outbred animals.
