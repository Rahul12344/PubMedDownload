Viral infection activates transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB and IFN
regulatory factor 3, which collaborate to induce type I IFNs and elicit innate
antiviral response. Virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) has been identified as
a critical adaptor required for virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs. In this
study, we showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING-finger protein 5 (RNF5)
interacted with VISA at mitochondria in a viral infection-dependent manner.
Domain mapping experiments indicated that the C-terminal transmembrane domain of 
VISA was required for its interaction with RNF5. RNF5 targeted VISA at K362 and
K461 for K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation after viral infection, whereas
knockdown of RNF5 reversed virus-induced downregulation of VISA at the early
phase. These findings suggest that RNF5-mediated ubiquitination and degradation
of VISA is one of the mechanisms of the regulation of virus-triggered induction
of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral response.
