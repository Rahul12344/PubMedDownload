An effective vaccine against enteric bovine coronavirus (BCV) must be able to
induce mucosal immunity. We recently described the construction of recombinant
human adenovirus type 5 (hAd5) carrying the BCV haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene
in the early transcription region 3 of the adenovirus genome. In this study, we
examined the induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses to the hAd5
vector carrying the BCV HE gene (AdBcHE) following intranasal or enteric
immunization of cotton rats. Regardless of the route of administration, mucosal
immunization with AdBcHE induced significant levels of anti-HE IgG antibodies in 
serum. In addition, following intranasal immunization with AdBcHE, significant
levels of anti-HE IgA antibodies were found in lung washes of immunized cotton
rats. Furthermore, the specific anti-HE antibodies in sera and mucosal secretions
efficiently neutralized BCV infectivity in vitro. T-cell proliferation and
cell-mediated cytotoxic responses against the BCV HE were elicited in the spleen 
of intranasally immunized animals. The results demonstrate that mucosal
immunization with AdBcHE is capable of inducing both systemic and mucosal
immunity to the BCV HE. These immune responses may be important in protecting
animals from BCV infection.
