BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is known for high mutation rates caused by 
lack of protective histones, inefficient DNA repair systems, and continuous
exposure to mutagenic effects of oxygen radicals. Alterations in the non-coding
displacement (D) loop of mitochondrial DNA are present in many cancers. It has
been suggested that the extent of mitochondrial DNA mutations might be useful in 
the prognosis of cancer outcome and/or the response to certain therapies. In
order to investigate whether a high incidence of mutations exist in mitochondrial
DNA of cervical cancer patients, we examined the frequency of mutations in the
D-loop region in 19 patients of cervical cancer.
RESULTS: Mutations, often multiple, were detected in 18 of 19 (95%) patients. The
presence of mutations correlated with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection in
these patients. Mutations were also detected in normal samples and lymphocytes
obtained from cervical cancer patients, but their frequency of occurrence was
much lower as compared to the cervical cancer tissues.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that D-loop alterations are frequent in
cervical cancers and are possibly caused by HPV infection. There was no
association of mtDNA D-loop mutations with the histopathological grade and tumor 
staging.
