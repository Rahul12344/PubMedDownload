SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis is presented as a technique with 
potential for the identification of maximum processing temperature in cooked meat
products derived from several species. The method is applicable to the
examination of these products where evidence to confirm heat inactivation of
viruses may be required for quarantine purposes. The methodology for sample
preparation, electrophoresis and visualization of separated proteins and an
estimate of molecular size of individual proteins is given.
