Strontium ranelate, which is used for postmenopausal osteoporosis, has been
associated with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
syndrome, a severe, acute, potentially fatal, multisystem adverse drug reaction
characterized by skin rash, fever, hematological abnormalities, and
lymphadenopathy with involvement of several internal organs. We report the case
of a woman who developed DRESS syndrome with a generalized maculopapular rash,
eosinophilia, dyspnea, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, and reactivation of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with liver damage 3 weeks after administration of
strontium ranelate for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Approximately 6 months after 
total remission of cutaneous symptoms, the patient developed autoimmune
hepatitis. This case confirms that strontium ranelate should be considered as a
possible factor in the etiopathology of DRESS syndrome as well as in the
subsequent development of autoimmune hepatitis. The possibility of developing
autoimmune hepatitis as a part of DRESS syndrome related to strontium ranelate
use can occur months after the acute episode.
