The FASTPlaqueTB assay is an established diagnostic aid for the rapid detection
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from human sputum samples. Using the FASTPlaqueTB
assay reagents, viable Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells were
detected as phage plaques in just 24 h. The bacteriophage used does not infect M.
avium subsp. paratuberculosis alone, so to add specificity to this assay, a
PCR-based identification method was introduced to amplify M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis-specific sequences from the DNA of the mycobacterial cell
detected by the phage. To give further diagnostic information, a multiplex PCR
method was developed to allow simultaneous amplification of either M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis or M. tuberculosis complex-specific sequences from plaque
samples. Combining the plaque PCR technique with the phage-based detection assay 
allowed the rapid and specific detection of viable M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis in milk samples in just 48 h.
