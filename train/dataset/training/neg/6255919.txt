Towards prediction and surveillance of Murray Valley encephalitis activity in
Australia.

Kay BH.

Current practices for early warning of activity of Murray Valley encephalitis and
other medically-important arboviruses are reviewed with view to improvement. Data
from previous papers on Culex annulirostris populations, environmental factors
and virus infection rates were reanalysed and the results considered as a basis
for prediction and surveillance. This goal will only be achieved with improved
national cooperation, a better epidemiological understanding and greater
knowledge of the bionomics of the major vector, Culex annulirostris. The improved
monitoring system will utilize meteorological, serological and entomological
criteria.
