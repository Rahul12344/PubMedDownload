Puumala (PUU) virus is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica, the
Scandinavian form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The infection is
acquired by airborne transmission of PUU virus from its rodent reservoir, the
bank vole. Besides serologic data indicating that the virus may spread also to
heterologous rodents, there is little information on the susceptibility of wild
living animals to PUU virus. We studied the occurrence of antibodies to PUU virus
in serum samples from 427 wild-living moose, of which 260 originated from the PUU
virus-endemic northern and central parts of Sweden and 167 originated from the
southern, nonendemic part of Sweden. Samples from 5 animals showed reactivity in 
an ELISA for recombinant PUU virus nucleocapsid protein, an immunofluorescent
assay, and a neutralization test. These 5 animals all originated from the PUU
virus-endemic northern part of Sweden. In conclusion, 5 of 260 moose from the
endemic region showed convincing serologic evidence of past PUU virus infection. 
The seroprevalence was low, suggesting that the moose is subjected to endstage
infection rather than being part of an enzootic transmission cycle.
