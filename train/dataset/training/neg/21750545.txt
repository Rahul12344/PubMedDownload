Mucosal epithelia provide strong barriers against pathogens. For instance, the
outward facing apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells lacks receptors for 
agents, such as hepatitis C virus, herpesvirus, reovirus, poliovirus or
adenovirus. In addition, macrophages eliminate pathogens from the luminal space. 
Here we show that human adenovirus type 5 engages an antiviral immune response to
enter polarized epithelial cells. Blood-derived macrophages co-cultured apically 
on polarized epithelial cells facilitate epithelial infection. Infection also
occurs in the absence of macrophages, if virus-conditioned macrophage-medium
containing the chemotactic cytokine CXCL8 (interleukin-8), or recombinant CXCL8
are present. In polarized cells, CXCL8 activates a Src-family tyrosine kinase via
the apical CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors. This activation process relocates the viral
co-receptor ανβ3 integrin to the apical surface, and enables apical binding and
infection with adenovirus depending on the primary adenovirus receptor CAR. This 
paradigm may explain how other mucosal pathogens enter epithelial cells.
