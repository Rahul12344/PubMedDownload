A quantitative culture method was used to test serial blood specimens from 28
lung transplant recipients at risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (donor [D] 
or recipient [R] seropositive for CMV). Viremia occurred in 26 (93%) of 28
patients. Highest levels were seen when the donor was seropositive. The median of
individual maximum levels was 2.13 infectious centers (ICs/10(5) leukocytes for
D+/R- patients (interquartile range [iqr], 0.12-21.77), 1.01 for D+/R+ (iqr,
0.3-2.32), and 0.10 for D-/R+ (iqr, 0.07-0.36; P = .030, Kruskal-Wallis test).
Higher levels were seen in patients with biopsy-proven CMV pneumonitis compared
with those with negative biopsies (mean, 0.24 [SD 0.51] ICs/10(5) leukocytes vs. 
0.01 [SD 0.03]; P = .039, Wilcoxon test) and with symptomatic CMV episodes
compared with asymptomatic episodes (median, 0.34 ICs/10(5) [iqr, 0.11-0.61] vs. 
0.08 ICs/10(5) [iqr, 0.03-0.13]; P = .045, Wilcoxon test). Further studies are
required to determine whether quantification of CMV viremia by this method will
be of practical value in the recognition of significant CMV infection in lung
transplant recipients.
