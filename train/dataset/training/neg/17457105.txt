Despite anecdotal reports of HIV-1 co-infections and super-infections, few
large-scale prevalence studies are available on multiple HIV-1 infection. We
systematically searched for HIV-1 co-infections by means of a heteroduplex
mobility assay in 660 HIV-1 seroconverters from the two ANRS SEROCO and PRIMO
cohorts. Our results strongly suggest that HIV-1 co-infection remains a rare
phenomenon in HIV-1 seroconverters infected in France between 1986 and 2004.
