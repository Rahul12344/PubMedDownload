BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Live-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has developed to
address the critical shortage of cadaveric organs that accounts for 20% of
children who die while awaiting for a liver transplant in Ontario each year. This
report reviews the outcome of the pediatric recipients of LDLT at the authors'
center.
METHODS: The charts of all children who received a LDLT between June 1996 and
March 2002 were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Thirteen children (mean age, 3.6 years) underwent LDLT. All donors were 
parents except for one cousin. Ten grafts were left-lateral segments, 2 were
right lobes, and 1 was a left lobe. Three patients required a SILASTIC((R)) (Dow 
Corning, Midland, MI) patch for delayed abdominal wall closure. Patient and graft
survival rate was 100% with a median follow-up of 376 days. Major postoperative
complications included biliary leaks (n = 2), biliary strictures (n = 1), portal 
vein thrombosis (n = 1), and hepatic venous complications (n = 1). There were no 
cases of hepatic artery thrombosis. Ten of 12 children became Positive for
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and 3 of these patients had readily treatable
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: LDLT is an acceptable alternative to cadaveric transplantation for
children with end-stage liver disease.
