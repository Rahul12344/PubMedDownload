The reversion of temperature-sensitive mutants of encephalomyocarditis virus upon
serial passage in three continuous cell lines.

Radloff RJ.

Several temperature-sensitive mutants of encephalomyocarditis virus were serially
passed numerous times in HeLa, L929 and BHK-21 cells. The reversion of most of
the mutants occurred most rapidly in BHK-21 cells and least rapidly in HeLa
cells.
