OBJECTIVE: To examine the causes of a low cure rate at the district level of a
tuberculosis (TB) control programme and to formulate, implement, and evaluate an 
intervention to improve the situation.
METHODS: The study setting was Mzuzu (population 60,000), where the annual
smear-positive pulmonary TB incidence was 160 per 100,000 and the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence was 67% among TB patients. There is
one TB treatment unit, but several other organizations are involved with TB
control. An examination of case-holding activities was carried out, potential
areas for improvement were identified, and interventions performed.
FINDINGS: In 1990-91, the cure rate was 24% among smear-positive cases (29% among
survivors to end of treatment). Problems identified included a fragmented TB
control programme; inadequate training and supervision; suboptimal recording of
patients' addresses; and nonadherence to national TB control programme protocols.
These problems were addressed, and in 1992-93 the cure rate rose to 68% (relative
risk (RR) = 2.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.63, 4.96)) and to 92% among
survivors to the end of treatment (RR = 3.12 (95% CI = 1.84, 5.29)). High cure
rates are therefore achievable despite high HIV prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple, inexpensive, local programmatic interventions can
dramatically improve TB case holding. This study demonstrates the need for
evaluation, training, and supervision at all levels of the programme.
