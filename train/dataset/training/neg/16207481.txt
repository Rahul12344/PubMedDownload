To better understand the mechanisms of transformation by the oncogene HER-2, we
transduced the human mammary epithelial (HME) cell line MCF-10A with HER-2 and
developed a cell line that appeared to moderately overexpress HER-2. These
MCF-10HER-2 cells were unable to grow in the absence of epidermal growth factor
(EGF). However, coexpression of HER-2 with the HPV-16 oncoproteins E6 and E7
resulted in EGF-independent cells that expressed very high levels of
constitutively activated HER-2. Interestingly, coexpression of E7 with HER-2
resulted in cells that were EGF-independent for growth but did not express HER-2 
to high levels, and coexpression of E6 with HER-2 resulted in cells expressing
higher levels of HER-2, which were still dependent on EGF for growth and
survival. The MCF-10HER-2E7 and HER-2/E6E7 cells exhibited constitutive
activation of a form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that had a faster
electrophoretic mobility than EGFR activated by exogenous growth factors.
Exposure of cells with EGFR activation to ZD1839 (Iressa), at concentrations
specific for EGFR, had little or no influence on proliferation of cells with
amplified HER-2 but little or no EGFR. These results indicate that HER-2, E6, and
E7 cooperate with endogenous EGFR to yield fully transformed cells.
