As ancestors of higher plants, mosses offer advantages as simple model organisms 
in studying complex processes such as development and signal transduction.
Overexpression of transgenes after genetic transformation is a powerful technique
in such studies. To establish a controllable expression system for this
experimental approach we expressed a chimeric protein consisting of the
Tn1O-encoded Tet repressor and the activation domain of Herpes simplex virion
protein 16 in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We showed that this protein
activates transcription from a suitable target promoter (Top 1O) containing seven
operators upstream of a TATA box. In media containing very low levels of
tetracycline (1 mg/l), expression levels of a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter
gene dropped to <1% of that in the absence of tetracycline. This regulation is
due to interference of tetracycline with the DNA binding activity of the Tet
repressor portion of the chimeric transcriptional activator. Stable transformants
grown for three weeks on tetracycline-containing media showed negligible GUS
activity, whereas GUS was expressed strongly within 24 h of transfer to
tetracycline-free media. Potent and stringently regulated expression of other,
physiologically active genes is thus readily available in the moss system using
the convenient ToplO expression system.
