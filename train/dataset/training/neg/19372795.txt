PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite remarkable progress in the development of drugs that
inhibit HIV-1 replication, eradication of the infection has not been achieved.
The principal reason is that the virus can persist in stable cellular reservoirs,
the best characterized of which is a small pool of latently infected resting
memory CD4 T cells that carry a stably integrated viral genome. This review
covers recent discoveries on the biology of this reservoir, particularly as
related to efforts to eliminate it.
RECENT FINDINGS: New studies suggest how the reservoir may be established during 
acute infection and define where the virus integrates in the human genome. In
addition, the relationship between the latent reservoir and the residual
low-level virus production that continues even in patients on optimal therapy is 
becoming clear. Several recent studies have described approaches for eliminating 
the latent reservoir. New insights into the biology of the reservoir are
providing a context for understanding the enormous obstacles that must be
overcome before the reservoir can be eliminated.
SUMMARY: The latent reservoir presents a formidable therapeutic challenge because
it allows the virus to persist as genetic information in the form of a stably
integrated provirus in an inherently stable cellular compartment. Eradication is 
complicated by the fact that the virus can undergo exponential expansion once
drug pressure is released. Thus eradication must be complete to be effective.
