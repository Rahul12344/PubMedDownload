We here present the case of a 22-year-old female of Suriname ethnicity with
ulcerative colitis who received treatment with mercaptopurine and infliximab. She
presented herself with a severe necrotizing tonsillitis due to herpes simplex
virus type-1 (HSV-1). Combination therapy consisting of immunomodulators and
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents is increasingly being used. Anti-TNF
therapy is associated with an increased risk of developing serious infections,
and especially patients receiving combination treatment with thiopurines are at
an increased risk. We here show that HSV infections can cause a severe
tonsillitis in immunocompromised patients. Early recognition is essential when
there is no improvement with initial antibiotic therapy within the first 24 to 72
h. HSV infections should be in the differential diagnosis of immunocompromised
patients presenting with a necrotizing tonsillitis and can be confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction. Early treatment with antiviral agents should be
considered especially if antibiotic treatment fails in such patients.
