Newcastle disease virus--some properties of Australian strains.

Westbury HA.

Seventeen Australian strains of Newcastle disease virus were tested for their
biological properties: mean death time, heat stability of the hemagglutinin and
infectivity of the virus at 56 C, the elution time of virus from chicken
erythrocytes, and the ability to hemagglutinate equine red blood cells. The
strains differed considerably in their reactions. All had mean-death-time indices
of 112 or greater, indicating that all were lentogenic. Strains were identified
that had heat-labile and -stable hemagglutinin and infectivity, slow and fast
elution, and variable ability to agglutinate equine erythrocytes. The
significance of the results is discussed in terms of their usefulness in
identifying exotic strains of the virus.
