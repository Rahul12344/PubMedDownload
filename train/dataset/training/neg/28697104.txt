BACKGROUND: Lipsch端tz ulcers are characterized by painful vulvar ulceration, most
commonly in young women. Because these lesions are so rarely seen, the diagnosis 
can be challenging.
CASE: An 18-year-old woman, without any prior sexual activity, developed painful 
blue vulval lesions. These became necrotizing ulcers, and she began antiviral
therapy for presumptive herpes infection. Herpes cultures, however, were
negative. Serology consistent with a recent Epstein-Barr virus infection resulted
in a diagnosis of Lipsch端tz ulcers.
CONCLUSION: Lipsch端tz ulcers, associated with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection 
or other viral and bacterial infections, are a type of nonsexually transmitted
vulvar ulceration. It is important to avoid selective attention to sexually
transmitted infections as the etiology to avoid unnecessary antiviral therapy and
immune suppressants. By considering other etiologies, the patient will be spared 
potentially embarrassing persistent questioning about her sexual history.
