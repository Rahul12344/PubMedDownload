Development of a shaker culture of Buffalo green monkey kidney cells: potential
use for detection of enteroviruses.

Goldstein G, Guskey LE.

Buffalo green monkey kidney cells were adapted to grow as shaker cultures.
Replication of environmental and clinical isolates of poliovirus, coxsackievirus,
and echovirus in these cultures was analyzed by plaque assay and compared with
replication in Buffalo green monkey kidney cell monolayers and HEp-2 cell shaker 
cultures. Dose-response tests with various concentrations of Mahoney type 1
poliovirus indicated that Buffalo green monkey kidney cell shaker cultures could 
detect as little as 1 PFU in an inoculum of 0.2 ml. These data suggest that
Buffalo green monkey kidney cell shaker cultures can be effectively used for the 
detection of small quantities of enteroviruses from environmental sources.
