Development of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry inhibitors represents an emerging
approach that satisfies a tandem mechanism for use with other inhibitors in a
multifaceted cocktail. By screening Chinese herbal extracts, oleanolic acid (OA) 
was found to display weak potency to inhibit HCV entry with an IC50 of 10 μM.
Chemical exploration of this triterpene compound revealed its pharmacophore
requirement for blocking HCV entry, rings A, B, and E, are conserved while ring D
is tolerant of some modifications. Hydroxylation at C-16 significantly enhanced
its potency for inhibiting HCV entry with IC50 at 1.4 μM. Further modification by
conjugation of this new lead with a disaccharide at 28-COOH removed the undesired
hemolytic effect and, more importantly, increased its potency by ~5-fold (54a,
IC50 0.3 μM). Formation of a triterpene dimer via a linker bearing triazole (70) 
dramatically increased its potency with IC50 at ~10 nM. Mechanistically, such
functional triterpenes interrupt the interaction between HCV envelope protein E2 
and its receptor CD81 via binding to E2, thus blocking virus and host cell
recognition. This study establishes the importance of triterpene natural products
as new leads for the development of potential HCV entry inhibitors.
