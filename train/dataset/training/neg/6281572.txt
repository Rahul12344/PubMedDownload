Protective effect of inactivated virus vaccine on Sendai virus infection in rats.

Tsukui M, Ito H, Tada M, Nakata M, Miyajima H, Fujiwara K.

Rats which had received two doses of inactivated Sendai virus vaccine were
resistant to intranasal virus challenge. Vaccination was equally effective when
administered by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or subcutaneous
routes but not the intranasal route. Rats vaccinated intraperitoneally with
inactivated Sendai virus vaccine were protected from contact infection. Suckling 
rats born to vaccinated dams were resistant to challenge infection at 3 weeks of 
age, but the resistance was not demonstrated after weaning at 4 weeks of age.
