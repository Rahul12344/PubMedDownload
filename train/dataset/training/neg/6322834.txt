The presence of RNA complementary to HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus) DNA in cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia after laser therapy.

Eglin RP, Kitchener HC, MacLean AB, Denholm RB, Cordiner JW, Sharp F.

In-situ hybridization of radiolabelled DNA probes to tissue sections detected RNA
complementary to HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus) DNA in 65% (22 of 34) biopsies from
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and in none of internally paired benign 
epithelia from individuals before treatment by laser vaporization cone. Laser
therapy did not produce an increase in clinical or subclinical HSV infections of 
the cervix. Of 18 patients with RNA complementary to HSV-2 DNA in CIN biopsies
before treatment, in whom treatment was successful, virus transcripts were
detected at follow-up in only two of them.
