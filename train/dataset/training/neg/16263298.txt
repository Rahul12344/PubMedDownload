Searching for anti-HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors of Thai medicinal plants led to
the isolation of a new cyclohexenyl chalcone named panduratin C (1) and chalcone 
derivatives (2-6) from the methanol extract of Boesenbergia pandurata rhizomes.
The known compounds were identified to be panduratin A (2), hydroxypanduratin A
(3), helichrysetin (4), 2',4',6'-trihydroxyhydrochalcone (5), and uvangoletin
(6). The structures of all compounds were elucidated on the basis of chemical and
spectroscopic methods. It was found that 3 possessed the most potent anti-HIV-1
PR activity with an IC50 value of 5.6 microM, followed by 2 (IC50 = 18.7 microM),
whereas other compounds exhibited only mild activity. Structure-activity
relationships of these compounds on anti-HIV-1 PR activity are summarized as
follows: (1) hydroxyl moiety at position 4 conferred higher activity than
methoxyl group; (2) prenylation of dihydrochalcone was essential for activity;
(3) hydroxylation at position 4''' reduced activity; and (4) introduction of
double bond at C1' and C6' of chalcone gave higher activity. As regards active
constituents contained in B. pandurata rhizomes, hydroxypanduratin A (3) and
panduratin A (2) are active principles against HIV-1 PR.
