To identify cis-acting elements in the foamy virus (FV) RNA pregenome, we
developed a transient-vector-production system based on cotransfection of
indicator gene-bearing vector and gag-pol and env expression plasmids. Two
elements which were critical for vector transfer were found and mapped
approximately. The first element was located in the RU5 leader and the 5' gag
region (approximately up to position 650 of the viral RNA). The second element
was located in an approximately 2-kb sequence in the 3' pol region. Although
small 5' and 3' deletions, as well as internal deletions of the latter element,
were tolerated, both elements were found to be absolutely required for vector
transfer. The functional characterization of the pol region-located cis-acting
element revealed that it is essential for efficient incorporation or the
stability of particle-associated virion RNA. Furthermore, virions derived from a 
vector lacking this sequence were found to be deficient in the cleavage of the
Gag protein by the Pol precursor protease. Our results suggest that during the
formation of infectious virions, complex interactions between FV Gag and Pol and 
the viral RNA take place.
