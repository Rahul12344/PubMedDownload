Between 1985-93, 55 patients were treated for Hodgkin's disease at the University
Hospital of Tromsø. The median diagnostic delay was four months and a significant
prolonged delay was connected with the lymphocyte predominance subgroup. The
ChlVPP regimen was shown to be a risk factor for herpes zoster virus infection.
The 5-year overall survival was 90%. The survivors experienced a low frequency of
symptoms and a high level of functioning. The females reported a significant
superior global quality of life and had a lower psychological distress and
fatigue score than the males. The cost of one quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
(production gains included and using a 10% discount rate) was estimated to be
1,651 pounds. This makes Hodgkin's disease one of the most cost-effective
malignancies to treat.
