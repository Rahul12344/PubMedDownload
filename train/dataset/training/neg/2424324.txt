Highly immunogenic artificial complexes based on synthetic immunopotentiating
polyions (artificial antigens and vaccines).

Petrov RV, Khaitov RM.

An interpretive review of the theoretical and experimental data on the
immunogenetic concept that "there are no strong and weak antigens, there are high
and low responder genotypes," developed and upheld by the authors is presented.
To achieve phenotypic correction (finding ways of turning genetically low
responder individuals into high responder ones) the authors have developed
complex antigens--artificial macromolecular complexes containing both the
required antigenic determinants and adjuvant structures. Synthetic nonnatural
carbohydrates and heterochain polyions with controlled structure (PAA, PVP,
polyconidine quarternary salts) were shown to act as immunopotentiators,
substituting the helper signal of T-cells. The authors' data confirm this
immunogenetic principle for developing highly immunogenic preparations,
prototypes of future vaccines.
