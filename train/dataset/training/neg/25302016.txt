BACKGROUND: KM-023 is a new second-generation nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase
inhibitor that is under development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) type 1 infection.
OBJECTIVE: This study determined KM-023 tolerability and pharmacokinetic
characteristics in healthy subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
dose-escalation study was conducted in 80 healthy South Korean male volunteers.
The subjects were allocated to single- or multiple-dose (once daily for 7 days)
groups that received 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg drug or placebo in a 4:1 ratio.
Safety and pharmacokinetic assessments were performed during the study. Plasma
and urine concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: The average maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the
concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC∞) values of KM-023 for the 
75-600 mg doses in the single-dose study ranged from 440.2 ng/mL to 1,245.4 ng/mL
and 11,142.4 ng · h/mL to 33,705.6 ng · h/mL, respectively. Values of the mean
Cmax at a steady state and AUC within the dosing interval ranged from 385.1 ng/mL
to 1,096.7 ng/mL and 3,698.9 ng · h/mL to 10,232.6 ng · h/mL, respectively,
following 75-600 mg doses in the multiple-dose study. Dose proportionality was
not observed for KM-023. KM-023 showed a 0.6-fold accumulation after multiple
doses in the 600 mg dose group. The mean half-life values ranged between 20.7 and
31.2 hours. KM-023 was generally well tolerated without serious adverse events.
CONCLUSION: KM-023 demonstrated dose- and time-dependent nonlinear
pharmacokinetic characteristics after single or multiple doses over a dose range 
(75-600 mg) in healthy subjects. KM-023 showed favorable tolerability in this
study. This Phase I clinical trial information can be used to design further
clinical studies appropriately to evaluate KM-023 in patients with HIV-1
infection.
