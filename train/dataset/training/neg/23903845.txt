We compared the plasma viromes of HIV-infected subjects with low versus high
CD4(+) T cell counts from the United States and Uganda by using deep sequencing
and detected HIV, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, GB virus C, anellovirus, 
and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) reads. An increase in the proportion of
reads for anelloviruses, a family of highly prevalent and genetically diverse
human viruses, was seen in subjects with AIDS from both countries. The proportion
of endogenous human retrovirus reads was increased in AIDS subjects from Uganda
but not the United States. Progression to AIDS is therefore associated with
changes in the plasma concentration of commensal viruses.
