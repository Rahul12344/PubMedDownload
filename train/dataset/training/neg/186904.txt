Fatal adenovirus pneumonia: Clinical and pathological features.

Schonland M, Strong ML, Wesley A.

A review of autopsies of 107 young children with pneumonia showed that 15
children (14%) had adenovirus infections, the diagnosis being based on
characteristic histopathological and ultrastructural features in the lungs.
Eleven (73%) of the cases of adenovirus infection followed on measles infection, 
and it is suggested that some became infected with adenovirus after admission to 
hospital. A review of clinical aspects revealed no unique features.
Histopathological examination of tissues showed a common picture of necrotising
bronchopneumonia, with minor degrees of rental tubular damage, infiltrates of
large mononuclear cells in spleen and nodes, and an absence of lymphoid germinal 
centres. On light microscopy, "rosette" and "smudge" cells were seen in these
cases, and two patterns of virus particle distribution in infected cells were
seen ultrastructurally. It is postulated that "smudge" cells contain numerous
crystalline viral arrays.
