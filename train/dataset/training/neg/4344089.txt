Chronic infection of the rabbit central nervous system by a slowly growing equine
herpesvirus.

Plummer G, Coleman PL, Henson D.

The spinal cords of rabbits were chronically infected by a slowly growing horse
herpesvirus (a "cytomegalovirus") inoculated directly therein. Virus was
recovered from the central nervous systems of some of such animals after more
than 1 year. The virus could be reisolated from all the animals killed during the
first few weeks after its injection; acute focal meningomyelitis was present with
involvement of gray and white matter of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels
of the spinal cords of these rabbits, though the nerve cells themselves remained 
undamaged. Thereafter, reisolation of the virus became sporadic, and no damage to
the spinal cord could be histologically discerned even in animals from which the 
virus was recovered. No paralytic or other clinical effects could be attributed
to the infection.
