Protective effect of low-dose interferon against neonatal murine cytomegalovirus 
infection.

Cruz JR, Dammin GJ, Waner JL.

Mice were injected with 10 to 5,000 reference units of interferon
intraperitoneally or subcutaneously within 24 h of birth and reinoculated
intraperitoneally 24 h later with 200 plaque-forming units of murine
cytomegalovirus. Mock interferon and virus diluent were the control inocula.
Infection of mock interferon-treated mice resulted in significant retardation of 
growth, accompanied by tissue injury and a depressed blastogenic response of
splenic lymphocytes. Prophylactic administration of interferon prevented growth
retardation and resulted in lower tissue viral titers and diminished injurious
effects of the virus. Intraperitoneal inoculation of interferon was more
protective than was subcutaneous, and 10 U of interferon was often as effective
as 5,000 U. Accelerated maturation and enhanced activity of lymphoid elements
were observed histologically in spleens and lymph nodes of interferon-treated
mice; supportive of these findings was the greater incorporation of [3H]thymidine
of splenocytes from interferon-treated mice. The protective effect of interferon 
may, therefore, be due to stimulation or accelerated maturation of cellular
immune functions.
