OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate herpes zoster (HZ) related
hospitalization rates in the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain), considering 
both total and complicated cases, and to analyze their temporal trends by sex and
age.
METHODS: Population based cross-sectional study of all hospital admissions with
an HZ diagnosis in any position from 2003 to 2013. Annual crude, age-adjusted and
age-specific hospitalization rates were calculated by sex and year. Joinpoint
Regression models were used to analyze time trends.
RESULTS: The incidence of hospitalizations with HZ increased significantly during
the study period from 10.81 to 16.97 per 100,000 person-year, with an average
annual rise of 2.80%. The rate of hospitalization of complicated HZ increased
from 4.67 to 8.99 per 100,000 person-year. No 'breakthrough points' of the time
trends were detected. The proportion of complicated HZ was similar in both sexes,
and increased from 43.2% to 53.0%. By age and sex significant increases affecting
women from age 85 and men from age 75 and in the group of 45-64 years were
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations related to HZ are increasing, with a significant
rise of complicated cases. Long term and more detailed studies are required to
monitor HZ.
