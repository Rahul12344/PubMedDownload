Infectivity of linear lambdaDNA molecules is proved to be about a hundred times
higher in calcinated E. coli K12 (lambai434) than in E. coli K12(lambda-): the
levels of transfection were 1-3-10(7) and 1-2-10(5) infective centers per 1 mug
DNA, respectively. In E. coli JC 5743 rec B21 defective for exonucleases I and V 
the level of transfection was 1-3-10(6). High infectivity of linear lambdaDNA in 
lysogenic cells cannot be explained by a helping effect of phage particles
spontaneously liberated by these cells. It can be caused by recombinations of
inserted lambdaDNA molecules with prophage or by the low activity of some
nucleases in the lysogenic cells. Covalently closed and "Hershey" ring forms of
lambdaDNA penetrate the calcinated cells as readily as linear molecules do but
the infectivity of the former ones is proved to be very low.
