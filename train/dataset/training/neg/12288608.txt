PIP: Frustrated with the failure of top-down health messages to change behavior, 
designers of awareness and prevention programs have turned to peer education as
the only effective alternative to prevent the spread of HIV. Peer educators live 
or work with the people NGO staff or government health workers are trying to
reach. Peers, unlike experts, are accepted as equals and can constantly reinforce
the prevention message. In Tanzania, the African Medical and Research Foundation 
(Amref) has applied the approach with great success. The organization in 1989
launched a small project targeting truck drivers and prostitutes along the
country's major highways. Both target populations have high rates of
HIV-seropositivity. The program involves peer education, condom promotion, and
encouraging people to seek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. NGOs and 
the government have since joined the effort so that the scheme now covers the
entire nation and a range of occupations. Much of Amref's program success is
likely due to the organization's determination to ensure that everyone in the
community fully understands and accepts the project.
