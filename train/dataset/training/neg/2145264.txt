The lysis gene E of bacteriophage phi X174 is entirely embedded in gene D.
Expression studies of genes D and E in Escherichia coli minicells and lysis times
obtained in the presence or absence of D translation showed that the simultaneous
expression of gene D does not affect protein E production. Thus, unlike other
overlapping gene pairs, gene E expression is independent from the upstream
translation of gene D. lacZ fusion studies and primer extension inhibition
analysis (toeprinting) revealed an intrinsically weak E ribosome-binding site,
which seems to be the major factor determining the low expression rate of the
gene and thus proper scheduling of cell lysis.
