The proportion of women in New York State diagnosed with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is increasing dramatically. In 1987, only 12% of
cumulative AIDS cases in New York were among women; by 1993, 26% of new cases of 
AIDS were. This evaluation describes community-based HIV programs that provide
services to women in New York State and are funded by the State Department of
Health's AIDS Institute. The evaluation assesses the success different programs
have had in reaching and engaging women. It also describes the problems
organizations face in serving their target populations. Four sets of data were
collected and analyzed to assess the care being received by female clients.
Programs appear to be reaching women who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
positive or at high risk of HIV infection, and once engaged, female clients find 
the services helpful. However, agencies report difficulties in finding and using 
the strategies that are most effective with women. Agencies appear to do a better
job of addressing their female clients' economic needs than those related to
gender, such as reproductive health care, family services, and access to clinical
trials.
