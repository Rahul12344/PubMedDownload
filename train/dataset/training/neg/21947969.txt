Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) infection in cattle and buffalo makes these animals
life-long carriers of the virus which is intermittently excreted in semen. In the
present study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was validated to
screen frozen semen from cattle and buffalo for BoHV-1 by amplification of the gB
gene of the virus. Analysing the intra- and inter-test variability, the assay was
found to be highly reproducible. High sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90.04%)
of this real-time PCR assay was recorded in comparison to virus isolation.
Extended frozen semen samples from 574 cattle and buffalo bulls that were
seropositive to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) tested by real-time PCR
indicated that 1.97% semen batches from cattle and 3.36% batches of buffalo semen
were positive for BoHV-1. The real-time PCR protocol will be useful for screening
large numbers of semen samples from IBR-seropositive cattle and buffalo bulls as 
the test is less time consuming and several batches of semen can be tested with
ease compared to virus isolation in cell culture.
