A time-series analysis was conducted to study the impact of climate variability
on the transmission of Japanese encephalitis in eastern China. Correlation and
regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between monthly
climatic variables and monthly incidence of Japanese encephalitis in Jieshou
County, China over the period 1980-96. Spearman's correlation analysis showed
that maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall were all associated with the
transmission of Japanese encephalitis in the county. Regression analysis
suggested that monthly mean minimum temperature and monthly precipitation had a
significant relationship with the transmission of Japanese encephalitis, with a
1-month lag effect. The results indicated that these climatic variables might be 
treated as possible predictors for regions with similar geographic, climatic, and
socio-economic conditions to Jieshou County.
