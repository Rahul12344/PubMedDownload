In a previous study we generated an anti-Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) preS1 humanized 
antibody (HzKR127) that showed in vivo HBV-neutralizing activity in chimpanzees. 
However, the antigen-binding affinity of the humanized antibody may not be
sufficient for clinical use and thus affinity maturation is required for better
therapeutic efficacy. In this study, phage display technique was employed to
increase the affinity of HzKR127. All six amino acid residues
(Glu95-Tyr96-Asp97-Glu98-Ala99-Tyr100) in the heavy (H) chain
complementarydetermining region 3 (HCDR3) of HzKR127 were randomized and
phage-displayed single chain Fv (scFv) library was constructed. After three
rounds of panning, 12 different clones exhibiting higher antigen-binding activity
than the wild type ScFv were selected and their antigen-binding specificity for
the preS1 confirmed. Subsequently, five ScFv clones were converted to whole IgG
and subjected to affinity determination. The results showed that two clones (B3
and A19) exhibited an approximately 6 fold higher affinities than that of
HzKR127. The affinity-matured humanized antibodies may be useful in anti-HBV
immunotherapy.
