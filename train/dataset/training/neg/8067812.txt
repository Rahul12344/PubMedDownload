A newly developed assay for antibody to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) was used to 
study the rate of exposure to HEV infection in two Saudi areas: Riyadh (Central
Province-788 people) and Gizan (Southern Province-630 people). These two regions 
were chosen for the study because the Riyadh area is an urban area and Gizan is
considered rural, based on sewage disposal and water sanitation systems in each
area. In both areas, HEV is endemic and acquisition of infection to the virus
starts early in life and increases with age. In both areas, males are also at
higher risk of acquiring the infection than females and this is probably because 
of social habits rather than genetic factors. The observation of higher anti-HEV 
prevalence in Gizan (14.9%) than in Riyadh (8.4%) (P < 0.0002) confirms earlier
observations that the level of exposure to HEV is related to the hygienic
conditions in the community and that improvement in sanitation is an effective
measure in lowering the spread of infection.
