A viral disease was identified on geraniums (Pelargonium spp.) grown in a
greenhouse at the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur,
exhibiting mild mottling and stunting. The causal virus (Cucumber mosaic virus,
CMV) was identified and characterized on the basis of host range, aphid
transmission, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), DNA-RNA hybridization
and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A complete coat
protein (CP) gene was amplified using degenerate primers and sequenced. The CP
gene showed nucleotide and amino acid homology up to 97%-98% and 96%-99%,
respectively with the sequences of CMV subgroup II. The CP gene also showed
homologies of 75%-97% in nucleotide and 77%-96% in amino acid with the CMV Indian
isolates infecting various crops. On the basis of sequence homology, it was
concluded that CMV-infecting geraniums in India belong to subgroup II.
