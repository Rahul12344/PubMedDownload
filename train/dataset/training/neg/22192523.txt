BACKGROUND: Reporter genes are often used as a selectable marker for generation
of recombinant viruses in order to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis and 
to obtain candidate vaccine viruses. Routine selection of the recombinant
parapoxvirus is time-consuming and labor intensive. Therefore, developing a novel
method for selection is critical.
RESULTS: In this study, we developed a rapid method to generate recombinant Orf
viruses (ORFV) based on the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter
gene as a selectable marker. The coding sequence of EGFP gene was amplified from 
pEGFP-N1 vector and subcloned into the pZIPPY-neo/gus plasmid under the control
of the early-late vaccinia virus (VACV) VV7.5 promoter and flanked by two
multiple cloning sites (MCS) to generate a novel transfer vector pSPV-EGFP. Using
the pSPV-EGFP, two recombination cassettes pSPV-113LF-EGFP-113RF and
pSPV-116LF-EGFP-116RF were constructed by cloning the flanking regions of the
ORFV113 and ORFV116 and inserted into two MCS flanking the EGFP gene. Using this 
novel system, two single gene deletion mutants OV-IA82Δ113 and OV-IA82Δ116 were
successfully generated.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach shortens the time needed to generate recombinant ORFVs
(rORFVs). Thus, the pSPV-EGFP vector provides a direct, fast, and convenient way 
to manipulate the recombinant viruses, indicating that it is highly suited for
its designed purpose.
