Factors limiting the adoption of iPSC technology include the cost of developing
lines and the time period that it takes to characterize and bank them,
particularly when integration free, feeder free, and Xeno-free components are
used. In this manuscript we describe our optimization procedure that enables a
single technician to make 20-40 lines at a time in a 24-96 well format in a
reliable and reproducible fashion. Improvements spanned the entire workflow and
included using RNA virus, reducing cytotoxicity of reagents, developing improved 
transfection and freezing efficiencies, modifying the manual colony picking
steps, enhancing passaging efficiency and developing early criteria of success.
These modifications allowed us to make more than two hundred well-characterized
lines per year.
