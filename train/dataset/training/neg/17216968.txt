Suspected cases of Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) in cattle were noted in some
farms of Alexandria governorate during the period from January to March 2000. The
investigated cattle suffered from oral and foot lesions associated with lameness 
in addition to fever in some and inappetance in others. At the same time the
contact workers and veterinarian suffered from fever, during the course of the
disease in cattle. Blood samples were withdrawal from suspected cases of cattle
(31 cases), and from 24 contact cases. Saliva and vesicular lesions of the tongue
were taken on glycerol buffer saline for isolation and serotyping of FMD virus by
hyperimmune sera. The virus was isolated from all saliva and vesicular lesions of
the diseased animals and serotyped as FMD O1. A total of 30 (96.77%) out of 31
suspected cases, while it was only 10 (41.67%) out of 24 contact cases were
positive by ELISA for anti-FMD antibodies. Also 25 blood samples were withdrawal 
from contact persons with diseased animals and were suffered from fever, while 25
blood samples were taken from contact persons but not suffered from fever while 5
blood samples were taken from persons were not in contact with any veterinary
source (Children) and were used as negative control. A total of 13 (52%) out of
25 and 2 (8%) out of 25 were positive for anti-FMD antibodies from diseased and
contact persons respectively.
