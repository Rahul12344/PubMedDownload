cis-3-Aminomethylcyclopentylmethanol (4) was used as a precursor in the synthesis
of carbocyclic nucleosides containing adenine, hypoxanthine, 8-azahypoxanthine,
uracil, and 5-iodouracil bases. None of these compounds had appreciable activity 
against eighteen viruses in the concentration ranges tested. Two of them showed a
weak cytostatic activity against three tumor lines.
