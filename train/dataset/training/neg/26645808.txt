Point mutations H274Y and N294S can lead to resistance of influenza virus strains
to some drug molecules. Recently, a large number of experiments has focused on
the many frameworks and catalytic residues thought to prevent the efficacy of
anti-flu drugs. In the past, most research has considered the role of drugs in
rigid proteins rather than in flexible proteins. In this study, we used molecular
dynamics simulation (MD) combined with structure- and ligand-based drug design
(SBDD and LBDD) methods to study dynamic interaction and protein dynamics
correlation statistics between compounds and both the framework and catalytic
residues in influenza virus N1 strains. Drug candidates were screened using the
IC50 of the docking result predicted by support vector machine, multiple linear
regression, and genetic function approximation (P < 0.001). As shown by MD,
saussureamine C and diiodotyrosine have a protein dynamics correlation similar to
that of sialic acid, and both can participate in hydrogen bond formation with
loop, framework, and catalytic residues. Our in silico findings suggest that
saussureamine C can inhibit H274Y and N294S mutants, and that diiodotyrosine can 
also inhibit N294S mutants. Therefore, the drugs saussureamine C and
diiodotyrosine have the potential to produce inhibitory effects on wild-type
influenza virus and some N1 mutants.
