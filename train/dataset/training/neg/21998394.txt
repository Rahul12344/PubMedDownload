To establish chronic infections, viruses must develop strategies to evade the
host's immune responses. Many retroviruses, including mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV), are transmitted most efficiently through mucosal surfaces rich in
microbiota. We found that MMTV, when ingested by newborn mice, stimulates a state
of unresponsiveness toward viral antigens. This process required the intestinal
microbiota, as antibiotic-treated mice or germ-free mice did not transmit
infectious virus to their offspring. MMTV-bound bacterial lipopolysaccharide
triggered Toll-like receptor 4 and subsequent interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent
induction of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10. Thus, MMTV has evolved to rely on the
interaction with the microbiota to induce an immune evasion pathway. Together,
these findings reveal the fundamental importance of commensal microbiota in viral
infections.
