Surface antigens produced by Herpesviruses Varicella-Zoster virus.

Ito M, Barron AL.

Surface antigen(s) was demonstrated by the mixed agglutination technique on cell 
cultures infected with varicella-zoster virus (V-Z). The reactions appeared to be
specific for V-Z, and no cross-reaction was obtained with herpes simplex virus
(HSV). V-Z surface antigen had similar physicochemical properties to that of HSV.
It was stable to heating at 56 C and treatment with 1% Formalin,
2,4-dinitrophenol, and periodate, whereas it was undetectable after exposure to
acetone or ethanol. Antibodies detecting surface antigen were present in high
titer in sera from varicella or herpes zoster patients and paralleled titers
obtained by the complement fixation test.
