We recently described that the autoimmune, central nervous system disease,
multiple sclerosis (MS), is genetically associated with the human endogenous
retroviral locus, HERV-Fc1, in Scandinavians. A number of dominant human genes
encoding factors that restrict retrovirus replication have been known for a long 
time. Today human restriction genes for retroviruses include amongst others
TRIMs, APOBEC3s, BST2 and TREXs. We have therefore looked for a role of these
retroviral restriction genes in MS using genetic epidemiology. We here report
that markers in two TRIMs, TRIM5 and TRIM22 and a marker in BST2, associated
statistically with the risk of getting MS, while markers in or near APOBEC3s and 
TREXs showed little or no effect. This indicates that the two TRIMs and BST2
influence the risk of disease and thus supports the hypothesis of a viral
involvement.
