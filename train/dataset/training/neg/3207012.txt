The purpose of this study was to identify the structural changes in the organ of 
Corti that correlate with retrograde cochlear neuronal degeneration. Thirty-eight
temporal bones with excellent histological preparation from 23 subjects having
hearing losses caused by cochlear disease were selected for study. Cytohistograms
were prepared for inner and outer hair cells, inner and outer pillar cells, inner
phalangeal cells, and cochlear neurons. The extent of neuronal degeneration was
found to be directly related to the extent of injury to inner pillar cells and
inner phalangeal cells, but not to loss of inner or outer hair cells. In most
cochleas the loss of dendritic nerve fibers exceeded the loss of cell bodies. The
findings support the concept that retrograde neuronal degeneration is initiated
by injury to the dendritic nerve fibers, secondary to collapse and/or
degeneration of the inner pillar cells and inner phalangeal cells.
