INTRODUCTION: The side effects profile of the new direct--acting antivirals for
the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is not fully elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: In this cross-sectional study, we aim to describe the incidence and
characteristics of a novel observation of de novo renal cryoglobulinemic
glomerulonephritis after successful treatment with DAA.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 12,985 Hepatitis C Patients (genotype IV) received the
new DAA. After successful treatment, patients with deranged renal functions or
proteinuria were referred to the nephrology department for assessment. The
clinical manifestations ranged from lower limb edema to the development of
purpura skin lesions. Cryoglobulins were tested in the serum using the PCR
detection.
RESULTS: Fifty patients had detectable de novo cryoglobulins in the serum. The
most common type in renal biopsies was membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
(52%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) developed in 46% of cases.
CONCLUSION: De novo cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and progression to CKD
may rarely complicate successful treatment of HCV using direct-acting antivirals.
