Feline panleucopenia virus was separated into "full" and "empty" particles by
banding in caesium chloride ultracentrifugation. Field cats free of serum
neutralising antibodies were separately infected with "full", "empty" and "mixed"
particles of the virus. No clinical disease was produced. However, cats infected 
with "full" particles developed antibody more rapidly than cats infected with the
other particles.
