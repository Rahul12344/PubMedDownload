BACKGROUND: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is an important cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide.
OBJECTIVES: To review the biology, immunology, and virology of rotavirus
infections and describe the efforts towards the construction of vaccines using
human and animal rotaviruses.
STUDY DESIGN: A review of the literature and provision of the author's
understanding and speculation of vaccination of infants against rotavirus
disease.
RESULTS: In August 1998 the Food and Drug Administration in the United States
approved the licensure of a rotavirus vaccine. Both the Advisory Committee of
Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics are likely to
recommend that the vaccine be given to all children by mouth as a series of three
doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The vaccine is made by combining a simian
rotavirus strain (RRV) with several human strains representing different
rotavirus serotypes. An understanding of the biology, immunology, and virology of
rotavirus will help to explain the strengths and limitations of the rotavirus
vaccine.
CONCLUSION: If used as recommended, the rotavirus vaccine should cause a
significant decrease in the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and office visits
of children infected with rotavirus.
