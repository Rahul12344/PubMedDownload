OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the immediate and underlying causes of death in adults
who died in hospital with a premortem diagnosis of tuberculosis.
DESIGN: Causes of death were assessed independently by internists and
pathologists in 50 adults admitted to two Soweto hospitals who died 24 h or more 
after admission. Detailed record reviews and complete autopsies, including HIV
tests when not performed premortem, were performed. In addition, a variety of
postmortem microbiological tests were performed.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients had HIV infection; all were antiretroviral naive.
Their median age was 34.5 years, median CD4 cell count was 48 cells/microl and
median length of hospitalization before death was 6 days. Autopsy confirmed the
premortem diagnosis of tuberculosis in 37 HIV-infected patients (79%), whereas 10
(21%) did not demonstrate tuberculosis. Bronchopneumonia and cytomegalovirus
pneumonitis were the leading pathologies in these 10 patients. In 47 HIV-infected
cadavers immediate or contributory causes of death were: extensive pulmonary
tuberculosis, 32 (68%); disseminated tuberculosis, 28 (60%); bacterial pneumonia,
13 (26%); cytomegalovirus pneumonitis in seven (15%); cytomegalovirus DNA was
found in 31 (66%) and Pneumocystis pneumonia was found in five cadavers (11%).
The lung, followed by lymph nodes, liver and kidney, were the commonest sites of 
tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 19 spleens, one of
which was multidrug resistant, and Salmonella spp. was cultured from 11 splenic
specimens.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated disseminated, extensive tuberculosis associated with 
advanced HIV disease. Severe bacterial infections, including salmonellosis, were 
the leading co-morbidity, suggesting that hospitalized HIV-infected adults in
whom tuberculosis is suspected may benefit from broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy.
