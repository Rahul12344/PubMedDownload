[An overview of surveillance of avian influenza viruses in wild birds].

[Article in Chinese]

Zhu Y, Shi JH, Shu YL.

Wild birds (mainly Anseriformes and Charadriiformes) are recognized as the
natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The long-term surveillance
of AIVs in wild birds has been conducted in North America and Europe since 1970s.
More and more surveillance data revealed that all the HA and NA subtypes of AIVs 
were identified in the wild ducks, shorebirds, and gulls, and the AIVs
circulating in wild birds were implicated in the outbreaks of AIVs in poultry and
humans. Therefore, the AIVs in wild birds pose huge threat to poultry industry
and human health. To gain a better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology 
of AIVs in wild birds, we summarize the transmission of AIVs between wild birds, 
poultry, and humans, the main results of surveillance of AIVs in wild birds
worldwide and methods for surveillance, and the types of samples and detection
methods for AIVs in wild birds, which would be vital for the effective control of
avian influenza and response to possible influenza pandemic.
