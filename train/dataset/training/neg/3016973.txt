Identification of bovine herpesvirus-1 polypeptides involved in serum
neutralization.

Lum MA, Reed DE.

Bovine herpesvirus (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus)-infected cell
antigens were solubilized with Nonidet P-40. The crude antigen extract was
separated by reaction with bovine hyperimmune serum in line
immunoelectrophoresis; individual immunoprecipitates were used to immunize
rabbits. Rabbit sera possessing serum neutralizing activity were analyzed by
reaction with crude antigen extract in immunoprecipitation sodium dodecylsulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot. Four
virus-specified glycopeptides, with molecular weights of 69-75K, 77-81K, 82-92K
and 108-115K, appeared to be involved in inducing serum neutralizing antibody.
