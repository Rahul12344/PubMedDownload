Human parainfluenza type 3 (PI3) virus was incorporated into microspheres
composed of a biocompatible and biodegradable DL-lactide and glycolide copolymer.
Sera from mice immunized with these microspheres showed an antibody response to
the viral glycoproteins and neutralized virus infectivity. The microspheres were 
also evaluated by intraperitoneal, oral, or intranasal administration to
determine their protective efficacy in the hamster. After challenge infection of 
the intraperitoneally immunized hamsters with live PI3 virus, a significant
reduction of virus titers in the respiratory tract was observed, demonstrating
the protective efficacy of the microencapsulated viral antigens.
