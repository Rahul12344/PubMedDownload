Antibody responses to the GOR epitope and hepatitis C virus (HCV) core were
investigated in 136 patients with chronic HCV infection. Patient age (P = .011)
and necroinflammatory activity (P < .001) were significantly greater in 92
(67.6%) patients with anti-GOR than in 44 (32.4%) patients without anti-GOR. HCV 
RNA concentration was significantly higher in patients with anti-GOR (P = .031). 
HCV 1a or 1b genotypes were also found according to anti-GOR status. GOR and HCV 
core (amino acids 5-19) antibody responses correlated significantly (rs = .615, P
< .001). Anti-HCV core(5-19) was detected in 67 (73%) of 92 patients with and in 
14 (32%) of 44 without anti-GOR (P < .001). Patients with concurrent anti-GOR and
anti-HCV core(5-19) had significantly greater necroinflammatory activity (P =
.003). By multivariate analysis, anti-HCV core(5-19), patient age, and
necroinflammatory activity were correlated with anti-GOR response (P < .001).
Reactivity to the GOR autoepitope correlates with HCV core response and liver
necroinflammatory activity, thus suggesting an immunopathogenic role in chronic
hepatitis C.
