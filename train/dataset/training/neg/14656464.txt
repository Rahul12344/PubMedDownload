A single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) was developed directed against
transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp46 of the virus maedi-visna, by the
application of the antibody phage display library. To get specific scFv binders, 
the library was panned against the biotinylated peptide of 20 amino acids
corresponding to the principal immunodominant domain of gp46 protein. The number 
of positively binding scFvs was evaluated by scFv-phage ELISA, BstN1
fingerprinting and DNA sequencing. The scFvs were expressed in soluble form and
purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) with a yield of
2-2.5 mg/l. Two scFvs have shown to recognize gp46 and gp150 proteins in Western 
blot analysis. The scFvs also recognized the virus in infected cells as shown by 
immunofluorescence assay. The affinity of the obtained antibody fragments to gp46
peptide was measured by surface plasmon resonance, and the resulting K(A) was in 
the 10(6)-10(7)lmol(-1) range. The application of characterized scFvs for
expression as intrabodies in intracellular immunization against virus maedi-visna
infection and for the diagnosis of this virus is discussed.
