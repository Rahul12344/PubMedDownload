The incidence of nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by Puumala virus, among
military troops operating in an endemic area of Sweden was investigated. A total 
of 705 soldiers (age 18-25) involved in field training in three different endemic
counties were bled twice within a 6-month interval. Three individuals
seroconverted when tested for Puumala virus antibodies by IgG ELISA. Symptoms
typical of NE were not recorded in any of the patients. However, mild febrile
episodes were recorded in 2 of the 3 individuals. One serologically confirmed
soldier with typical NE symptoms was found in another group of 12,000 troops.
This soldier fell ill 3 weeks after a 7-day-long field exercise. The present
study indicates that military populations are at considerably greater risk of
contracting NE when compared to the entire population residing in the same area.
