Analysis of transcription during type C viral induction using cell
permeabilization techniques.

Long CW, Bruszewski JA, Snead RM.

The reversible cell permeabilization procedure of Castellot et al. has been
applied to chemical induction of endogenous type C virus from mouse cells. This
procedure has provided a direct demonstration of the alpha-amanitin sensitivity
of viral transcription in intact cells at concentrations known to inhibit RNA
polymerase II.
