Characteristics and functions of human cytomegalovirus UL128 gene/protein.

Tao R, Xu J, Gao H-, Zhao W-, Shang S-.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) ORF UL128 protein is highly conserved among viral
field isolates and functions in two different molecular forms, monomeric UL128
protein and in a complex with glycoproteins gH, gL, UL130, and UL131A protein.
Monomeric UL128 protein works as soluble chemokine analogue to attract peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and selectively induces expression of interleukin
6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in PBMCs. The
gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A complex is indispensable for entry into both endothelial
and epithelial cells. In conclusion, UL128 plays an important role in HCMV
infection.
