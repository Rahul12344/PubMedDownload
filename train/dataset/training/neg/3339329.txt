The morphogenesis of yellow fever virus replication was examined in infected Vero
cell cultures. Penetration and uncoating occurred by endocytosis with the
formation of coated vesicles, similar to that demonstrated for other enveloped
and unenveloped viruses. Inclusion bodies associated with newly formed
nucleocapsids were evident in the perinuclear region during the growth cycle. No 
evidence of RNA synthesis in the vicinity of the inclusion bodies was obtained by
autoradiography, suggesting that genome replication and assembly of viral
nucleocapsids occur at separate cytoplasmic sites. An excessive proliferation of 
membrane-bound organelles involving both vacuoles and endoplasmic reticula was
the most striking feature of virus-infected cells late in infection. No
morphological changes in the appearance of nuclei or mitochondria were detected. 
Virus release appeared to occur by movement of nascent virions through the
proliferated endoplasmic reticula followed by exocytic fusion of virus-containing
vesicles with the plasmalemma. A possible mechanism whereby the internal
nucleocapsid acquires an outer envelope is discussed.
