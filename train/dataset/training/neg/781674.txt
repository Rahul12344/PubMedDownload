Hybridization of RNA to double-stranded DNA: formation of R-loops.

Thomas M, White RL, Davis RW.

RNA can hybridize to double-stranded DNA in the presence of 70% formamide by
displacing the identical DNA strand. The resulting structure, called an R-loop,
is formed in formamide probably because of the greater thermodynamic stability of
the RNA-DNA hybrid when it is near the denaturation temperature of duplex DNA.
The rate of R-loop formation is maximal at the temperature at which half of the
duplex DNA is irreversibly converted to single-stranded DNA (the strand
separation temperature of tss) of the duplex DNA and falls precipitously a few
degrees above or below that temperature. This maximal rate is similar to the rate
of hybridization of RNA to single-stranded DNA under the same conditions. At
temperatures above the tss the rate is proportional to the RNA concentration.
However, at temperatures below tss the rate of R-loop formation is less dependent
upon the RNA concentration. Once formed, the R-loops display considerable
stability; the formamide can be removed and the DNA can be cleaved with
restriction endonucleases without loss of R-loop structures.
