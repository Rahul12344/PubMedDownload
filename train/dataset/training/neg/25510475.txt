Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV3), also known as koi herpesvirus (KHV), can be
subdivided primarily into European and Asian genotypes, which are represented by 
CyHV3-U or CyHV3-I and CyHV3-J, respectively. In this study, the whole genome
sequence of a novel Chinese CyHV3 isolate (GZ11) was determined and annotated.
CyHV3-GZ11 genome was found to contain 295,119 nucleotides with 52.9% G/C
content, which is highly similar to those of published CyHV3-U, CyHV3-I, and
CyHV3-J strains. With reference to CyHV3-U, CyHV3-I, and CyHV3-J, CyHV3-GZ11 was 
also classified into 164 open reading frames (ORF), which include eight repeated 
ORFs. On the basis of the 12 alloherpeviruses core genes, results from
phylogenetic analysis showed that CyHV3-GZ11 had closer evolutionary
relationships with CyHV3-U and CyHV3-I than with CyHV3/KHV-J, which were also
supported by genome wide-based single nucleotide substitution analysis and the
use of a series of developed molecular markers. This study was the first to
reveal the presence of a distinct European CyHV3 genotype in East and Southeast
Asia at a whole genome level, which will evoke new insights on exploring the
origin, evolution, and epidemiology of the virus.
