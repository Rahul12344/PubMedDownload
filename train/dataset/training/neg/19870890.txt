The virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis can be sedimented in the
ultracentrifuge and washed repeatedly; the virus retains its activity provided
that a small amount of normal serum is present in the diluent. A soluble
substance capable of fixing complement in the presence of immune serum can be
separated from the virus. Washed virus fixes complement poorly. The serologically
specific soluble antigen is widely distributed in tissues of infected guinea
pigs, mice, and monkeys.
