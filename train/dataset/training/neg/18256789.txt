Nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is an uncommon disease, but usually shows a
highly aggressive clinical course. The disease is much more frequent in Asian and
Latin American countries than in Western countries, and is universally associated
with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Analyses of gene mutations, especially
p53 and c-KIT, revealed the different frequencies by district. Epidemiological
studies revealed the changes of the disease frequency in Korea during the period 
from 1977-1989 to 1990-1996. Case-control study showed that the exposure to
pesticides and chemical solvents could be causative of NKTCL. Further studies
including HLA antigen typing of patients is necessary to further clarify the
disease mechanism.
