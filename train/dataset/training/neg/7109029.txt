Fatty acid modification of Newcastle disease virus glycoproteins.

Chatis PA, Morrison TG.

The fatty acid acylation of Newcastle disease virus hemagglutininin-neuraminidase
and fusion glycoproteins was assayed. [3H]palmitate label was associated with
cytoplasmic fusion proteins (F0 and F1) and virion-associated F1. In contrast,
there was no detectable [3H]palmitate label associated with the
hemagglutin-neuraminidase protein in Newcastle disease virus-infected Chinese
hamster ovary cells or chicken embryo cells or in virions released from these
cells. Thus, fatty acid modification may not be important for the maturation of
some glycoproteins.
