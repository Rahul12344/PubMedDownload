Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) from 5899
female out-patients with inflammation of genitourinary tract was detected. Among 
18.57% positive cases, the effective rates of the gonorrhea (26.07%) and
urethritis (23.73%) were higher than those of the Condyloma acuminatum (CA)
(17.73%), vaginitis (17.70%), and cervicitis (11.54%)(P< 0.01), indicating that
there were various degrees of NG infection in genitourinary tract diseases.
Moreover, Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), NG, and human 
papilloma viruses (HPV) were also detected in 8329 patients with vaginitis. Among
20.01% positive cases, the positive rate of UU was 39.95%, CT 21.36%, NG 17.70%, 
and HPV 16.40%. Variance analysis showed that significant differences existed in 
the vaginitis caused by different pathogens ( P <0.01); namely, four kinds of
pathogens were present in the patients with vaginitis.
