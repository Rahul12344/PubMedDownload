Analysis of antigenic determinants on internal and external proteins of influenza
virus and identification of antigenic subpopulations of virions in recent field
isolates using monoclonal antibodies and immunogold labelling.

Patterson S, Oxford JS.

An electron microscopic immunogold labelling technique employing monoclonal
antibodies has been applied to the antigenic analysis of influenza A and B
viruses. Reassortant influenza A H3N2 viruses containing haemagglutinin molecules
from viruses isolated between 1968 and 1982 were analysed with a panel of
monoclonal antibodies raised against viruses which appeared over the same period.
The immunogold labelling technique clearly demonstrated the antigenic drift in
the haemagglutinin molecule that occurred between 1968 and 1982. When the
technique was applied to the examination of viruses from a more geographically
restricted influenza epidemic in a semi-closed community, antigenic variants were
found. Furthermore the technique enabled the identification of distinct antigenic
variant subpopulations within a single clinical isolate. Analysis of the HA of
MDCK cell or egg grown virus by this procedure provided data to support the
hypothesis that the host cell exerts selective pressure on subpopulations of
virus resulting in the emergence of antigenic variants.
