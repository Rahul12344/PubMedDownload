[Immune response and B hepatitis (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Tittor W, Schwalbach G.

The different forms of chronic hepatitis are due to different individual immune
responses after infection with hepatitis B virus. A report is given about
specific and unspecific defense mechanisms coming into play after infection,
about immunological and immunopathological reactions, and about the pathogenetic 
significance of these processes. At present unfortunately our knowledge in this
particular field is rather limited; more detailed information is needed about
humoral, cellular, immune complex related, and autoimmunological events, if one
wishes to explain the different courses of hepatitis on these grounds.
