OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of Rotavirus infection in children under
five years of age presenting with diarrhoea.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
SETTING: Mapulaneng Hospital, Bushbuckridge, Republic of South Africa.
SUBJECTS: 50 children under five years of age presenting with diarrhoea.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rotavirus seroprevalence.
RESULTS: Out of 50, 24 (48%) had detectable Rotavirus particles in their stools. 
The highest incidence of infection was observed among the seven to 12 months age 
group. Out of the 245 positive subjects 22 (91.7%) were breast fed.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that diarrhoea in children under five years of age
is probably caused by Rotavirus in Bushbuckridge. We therefore recommend that all
children presenting with diarrhoea should be screened for Rotavirus.
