The emergence of mutations leading to drug resistance is the main cause of
therapeutic failure in the human HIV infection. Chemical system biology approach 
has drawn great attention to discover new antiretroviral hits with high efficacy 
and negligible toxicity, which can be used as a prerequisite for HIV drug
resistance global action plan 2017-21. To discover potential hits, we docked 49
antiretroviral analogs (n = 6294) against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase Q151M
mutant & its wild-type form and narrow downed their number in three sequential
modes of docking using Schrödinger suite. Later on, 80 ligands having better
docking score than reference ligands (tenofovir and lamivudine) were screened for
ADME, toxicity prediction, and binding energy estimation. Simultaneously, the
area under the curve (AUC) was estimated using receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curve analysis to validate docking protocols. Finally, single point energy 
and molecular dynamics simulation approaches were performed for best two ligands 
(L3 and L14). This study reveals the antiretroviral efficacy of obtained two best
ligands and delivers the hits against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase Q151M mutant.
