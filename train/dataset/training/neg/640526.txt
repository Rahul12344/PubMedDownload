Bhanja virus was isolated from ticks of the genus Haemaphysalis (H. punctata and 
H. sulcata) collected from sheep pastured in the surroundings of Akhtopol in
southeast Bulgaria, and simultaneously blood sera of 58 sheep were investigated
in plaque-reduction neutralization test with B lranja arbovirus. All sera
contained antibodies to this virus in titres from 1:32 to 1:4096 (geometrical
mean titre 1:494). The district of Akhtopol proved to be a natural focus of
Bhanja virus.
