The article presents the results of analysis of the frequency of detection of
cryoglobulinemic syndrome (CGS) and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with
HCV-associated liver cirrhosis (LC) depending on its stage. There were also
evaluated clinical and laboratory features of the disease. The study involved 72 
patients with chronic hepatitis C who were divided into 3 main groups according
to the presence of LC. The I group included 32 patients with chronic hepatitis C 
without LC. The II group consisted of 19 patients with compensated HCV-associated
LC and III group included 21 patients with decompensated LC. It was shown that
terminal stages of the LC (class B-C by Child-Pugh) are characterized by more
frequent presence of IR and CGS with more severe clinical picture, which may be
caused not only by the influence of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), but also by the 
progression of LC.
