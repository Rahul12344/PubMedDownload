Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primarily infects and then destroys
CD4-positive lymphocytes, leading to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS). Over 20 drugs, most small and orally bioavailable, have been approved,
and include reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. In 2003, the US-FDA
approved enfuvirtide (T-20), a 36-amino acid peptide derived from the C-terminal 
heptad repeat of the HIV-1 gp41 ectodomain. T-20 was initially identified in 1992
from biological studies, and can effectively suppress HIV-1 infection with
multi-drug resistance. Currently, numerous fusion inhibitory peptides have been
designed and synthesized. Some of these peptides show strong inhibition even
towards HIV-1 strains resistant to T-20. These developments also facilitate basic
research into the mechanisms of HIV-1 fusion, because peptide inhibition
resembles the process of viral fusion with the cellular membrane. In this review,
we focus on HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and the application of their development and 
clinical findings to the concept of "biology to chemistry" to support rational
drug design for small bioavailable compounds.
