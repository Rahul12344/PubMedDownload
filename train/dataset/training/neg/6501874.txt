Surveillance of hepatitis B virus infection in Scotland, 1973-1982.

Ako TI, Follett EA, Dewar RD, Cossar JH, Reid D.

Since 1973 epidemiological surveillance of laboratory-confirmed hepatitis B virus
infection has been undertaken in Scotland. During the ten-year period, 1973-82,
2893 persons with laboratory evidence of infection were reported and the number
increased by almost threefold between the beginning and the end of this time.
Males accounted for 66% of the patients and intravenous drug abuse was the most
commonly encountered risk factor. The low risk to laboratory staff is confirmed, 
but among National Health Service hospital staff nurses accounted for 54% of
those reported.
