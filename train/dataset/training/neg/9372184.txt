The dimeric catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) of Escherichia coli uses its 
recognition helix to bind with each subunit the DNA sequence motif 5'
G-7T-6G-5A-4 3'. It makes a direct amino acid-base contact with E181 and cytosine
in position-5' on the reverse strand. While testing mutants of CAP in position
181 for specificity changes, we found that CAP E181Q is lethal in high amounts
for the E. coli strains we used for cloning. We cloned this CAP mutant
successfully in cya- strains, where CAP is inactive. Examination of the in vitro 
binding activities of CAP E181Q, and of in vivo activity when present in low,
non-lethal amounts, revealed loss of specificity but not of binding capacity for 
its DNA targets. It binds well to CAP consensus with G or T in position-5, better
to CAP consensus with A, C in position-5, quite well to lambda consensus operator
with G in position-7 and rather weakly to lambda consensus.
