Viral antibody levels and clinical status in acute exacerbations of chronic
bronchitis: a controlled prospective study.

Stenhouse AC.

A controlled prospective study was made of a group of patients with chronic
bronchitis, in which serum antibodies against a group of viruses and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae were estimated at regular intervals. Sixteen significant rises in
antibody titre were shown, of which eight were associated with clinical acute
exacerbations of bronchitis. In individual patients no correlation was found
between the number of acute exacerbations or the aetiological agent and
persistent change in ventilatory function as expressed by the F.E.V.(0.75).This
study was compared with the results of a previous parallel investigation of the
same patients done to study the significance of rhinovirus infections. In the
present investigation 12% of the acute exacerbations were associated with the 11 
agents tested compared with 14% associated with rhinoviruses in the earlier work.
