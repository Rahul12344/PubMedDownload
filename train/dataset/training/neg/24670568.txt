Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) with antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces
incident tuberculosis among patients infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus. We describe IPT use among patients on ART at two primary care clinics in
South Africa. Of 597 participants interviewed, 100 (16.8%) reported IPT use;
73.4% (365/497) with no reported IPT use were eligible for IPT. IPT use was
associated with age <35 years (aOR 1.90, 95%CI 1.18-3.06), and receiving care at 
one clinic as opposed to the other (aOR 4.72, 95%CI 2.69-7.93). The high
proportion of patients on ART eligible for IPT represents a missed opportunity
for IPT scale-up.
