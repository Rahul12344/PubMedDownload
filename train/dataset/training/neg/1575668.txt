In an experimental study we tested the survival of hog cholera virus (HCV)
contained in pieces of muscular tissue and organs from experimentally infected
swine after incubation in silage. In big (diameter greater than 20 cm) muscular
pieces HCV survived even in excellent mineral acid silage (pH 3.8-4.0) after a
storage of 5 months. On the other hand in smaller parts (musculature tissue,
organs less than 20 cm diameter) we never found virulent HCV after 3 months of
incubation. Independent of the size of the tested organs we did not find any
virulent HCV in silage with pH 5.2 after 3 months. The results of our
investigations show, that the feeding of green silage in areas with hog cholera
among wild boar is a potential risk for the domestic swine population. In
conclusion we propose to feed green silage to unvaccinated pigs in such areas
only after a storage of 9 month.
