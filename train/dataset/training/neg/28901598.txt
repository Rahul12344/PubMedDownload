Public health agencies' obligations and the case of Zika.

Luna F.

This article focuses on the initial reactions to the Zika epidemic by national
and international public health agencies. It presents and analyzes some responses
public officials made about sexual and reproductive health at the inception of
the epidemic. It also describes the different challenges and obligations faced by
local and international public health agencies, as these have not been clearly
outlined. The article argues that these agencies have different obligations and
should fulfill them despite existing obstacles. While international agencies
should honor their leadership role and make recommendations at a meta-level,
local agencies should provide, in the case of Zika, a framework for empowerment
and grant women the freedom to achieve sexual and reproductive health so that
they can avoid the consequences of this epidemic.
