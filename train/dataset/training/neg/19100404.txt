AIM: We report the renal graft outcomes among a series of patients who underwent 
simultaneous combined liver-kidney transplantations (CLKT) or heart-kidney
transplantations (CHKT) at a single center.
METHODS: From 1975 to December 31, 2007, we performed 1524 kidney
transplantations, 427 liver transplantations, and 483 heart transplantations,
including 7 simultaneous CLKT and 2 CHKT. We analysed the main patient
characteristics, renal graft outcomes, and patient survivals.
RESULTS: CLKT indications were as follows: alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 5) and
hepatitis C virus (n = 2) with chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 5), hypertensive
nephropathy (n = 1), and polycystic disease (n = 1). Cold renal ischemia time was
6.9 hours (range, 6-9). In 5 patients there were no kidney rejection episodes; 3 
of these patients are alive with creatinine levels between 1.4 and 1.7 mg/dL with
an average follow-up of 6.9 years (range, 10 months-8 years). One patient died of
esophageal cancer at 13 years after transplantation with a serum creatinine level
of 1.16 mg/dL and another died of breast cancer at 7 years after transplantation 
with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. One patient lost his renal graft just after
the kidney transplantation due to renal vein thrombosis. The last patient
suffered 1 episode of acute rejection and lost his kidney 5 years later due to
chronic rejection. CHKT indications were as follow: dilated myocardiopathy (n =
2) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 1) or interstitial nephropathy (n = 1).
The cold renal ischemia time was 4 hours. There were no acute rejection episodes.
One patient is alive with a creatinine level of 2.05 mg/dL at 6 years after the
transplantation; the other patient lost his kidney due to chronic rejection at
270 days after simultaneous CHKT, and 2 years later received a second kidney that
is functioning normally.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous CLKT and CHKT in selected cases provided satisfactory
long-term outcomes in both graft function and patient survival with lesser number
of acute rejection episodes than nonsimultaneous transplantations. They are
worthy options for patients with liver or heart failure associated with renal
failure.
