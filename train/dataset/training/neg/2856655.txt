The differentiation antigen T4 is present on the helper/inducer subset of T
cells. In the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), this lymphocyte subset 
is selectively depleted by HTLV-III/LAV virus which apparently uses the T4
antigen as a viral receptor. The autoradiographic visualization of the T4 antigen
on sections of squirrel monkey brain shown here reveals a heterogeneous pattern
with clustering in the same emotion-mediating regions of the brain that are
usually enriched with neuropeptide receptors. Immunoprecipitates of cell
membranes from primate brain indicate that an antigen very similar to T4 is
present on brain and T4+ T lymphocytes. Since patients with AIDS frequently
develop complications of the central nervous system and HTLV-III/LAV sequences
have been found in the brain, these data suggest that direct infection of some
brain cells with HTLV-III/LAV occurs via a mechanism involving the T4 antigen
complex similar to that proposed for lymphocyte infection. In view of the brain
sites found to express the T4-like antigen, the behavioral changes and mood
shifts observed in AIDS patients may result from localized viral replication.
