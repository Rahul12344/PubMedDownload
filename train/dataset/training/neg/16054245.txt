Picornavirus replication causes leakage of cytoplasmic K+ and an influx of Na+
and Ca2+. In this study, we have explored the possibility that a blockade of Ca2+
and Na+ influx would reduce rhinovirus production and/or release. The
Ca2+-channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, as well as the blocker of Na+/H+ 
exchange and the epithelial Na+ channel, EIPA, inhibited both virus production
and release. The effect on virus release was more pronounced than the effect on
production, thus raising the possibility that rhinovirus release may serve as a
target for antiviral agents. Unexpectedly, our results also showed that the
antiviral activity of the Ca2+-channel blockers was not due to the block of Ca2+ 
influx. Similarly, the antiviral activity of EIPA appeared to be unrelated to the
blockade of cellular Na+/H+ exchanger or the epithelial Na+ channel. Potential
alternative mechanisms of the antiviral activity of these compounds are
discussed.
