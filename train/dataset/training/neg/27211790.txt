Norovirus infections are a major cause of gastroenteritis, and outbreaks occur
frequently. Several factors are currently increasing the challenge posed by
norovirus infections to global health, notably the increasing number of
infections in immunocompromised individuals, who are more susceptible to disease,
and the globalization of the food industry, which enables large norovirus
outbreaks to occur on an international scale. Furthermore, the rapid rate of the 
genetic and antigenic evolution of circulating noroviruses complicates the
development of vaccines and therapies that are required to counter these
challenges. In this Review, we describe recent advances in the study of the
transmission, pathogenesis and evolution of human noroviruses, and consider the
ongoing risk of norovirus outbreaks, together with the future prospects for
therapeutics, in a rapidly changing world.
