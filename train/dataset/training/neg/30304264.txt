INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of low bone mass is 3 times higher in people living 
with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) and using antiretrovirals than in the
HIV-unaffected population. Changes in vitamin D levels is one of the factors
associated with decreased bone mass. The objective of this study is to evaluate
the low bone mass and altered vitamin D levels in PLWH who have not been exposed 
to antiretrovirals.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with HIV-infected individuals
between the ages of 18 and 55 years immediately prior to the start of
antiretroviral therapy in a specialized reference center focusing on infectious
and parasitic diseases. Results of clinical examination (patient's weight,
height, blood pressure, and clinical history), laboratory tests, and X-ray
absorptiometry, were collected.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were included, with a mean age of 34 years. Nine (16.7%) 
patients presented with low bone mass and 4 (7.1%) patients showed low total
femur BMD. Analysis revealed that 23.3% and 36.7% of the patients had deficient
and insufficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study population presented with compromised bone health and with
low bone mineral density and 25-(OH)-vitamin D levels.
