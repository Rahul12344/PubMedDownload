Neural pathogenesis of experimental scrapie after intraocular inoculation of
hamsters.

Buyukmihci N, Goehring-Harmon F, Marsh RF.

Hamsters were inoculated intravitreally with the scrapie agent. All animals
developed scrapie and retinal degeneration typical of scrapie. The retinal
degeneration was greater in the inoculated eyes than in the uninoculated eyes.
Replication of the scrapie agent was rapid in the inoculated eye. Infectivity
then spread slowly down the ipsilateral optic nerve to the brain. The replication
in the brain paralleled that in the retina of the uninoculated eye. The results
support a neural spread of scrapie.
