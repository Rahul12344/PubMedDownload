BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies point to an inverse relationship between
microbial exposure and the prevalence of allergic diseases. The underlying
mechanism for this observation remains largely unknown, as well as the nature of 
the microbes involved.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of early infection with human herpesviruses
(HHVs) on IgE formation and T-helper type 2 (Th2) development in infants.
METHODS: Serum was collected from children aged 18 months and assessed for IgE to
common allergens and IgG to five common herpesviruses. Cord blood plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pDC) were exposed to HHV type 6 in vitro and mixed with
allogeneic cord blood CD4(+) T cells. Cytokine levels were determined by ELISA
and by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We found that children seropositive at 18 months of age to HHV type 6
were significantly less often IgE sensitized than seronegative children [odds
ratio (OR): 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.009-0.68]. HHV type 6 also
decreased the production of the Th2-associated cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 by CD4(+)
T cells when co-cultured with allogeneic cord blood pDC. This was associated with
an increased production of IFN-alpha by pDC exposed to HHV type 6.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that an early childhood infection with HHV type 6
could down-regulate Th2 responses and reduce IgE formation to common allergens in
a young child.
