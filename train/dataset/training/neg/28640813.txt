Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a common, autoimmune exocrinopathy distinguished by
keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Patients frequently develop serious
complications including lymphoma, pulmonary dysfunction, neuropathy, vasculitis, 
and debilitating fatigue. Dysregulation of type I interferon (IFN) pathway is a
prominent feature of SS and is correlated with increased autoantibody titers and 
disease severity. To identify genetic determinants of IFN pathway dysregulation
in SS, we performed cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses
focusing on differentially expressed type I IFN-inducible transcripts identified 
through a transcriptome profiling study. Multiple cis-eQTLs were associated with 
transcript levels of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) peaking at
rs10774671 (PeQTL = 6.05 × 10-14). Association of rs10774671 with SS
susceptibility was identified and confirmed through meta-analysis of two
independent cohorts (Pmeta = 2.59 × 10-9; odds ratio = 0.75; 95% confidence
interval = 0.66-0.86). The risk allele of rs10774671 shifts splicing of OAS1 from
production of the p46 isoform to multiple alternative transcripts, including p42,
p48, and p44. We found that the isoforms were differentially expressed within
each genotype in controls and patients with and without autoantibodies.
Furthermore, our results showed that the three alternatively spliced isoforms
lacked translational response to type I IFN stimulation. The p48 and p44 isoforms
also had impaired protein expression governed by the 3' end of the transcripts.
The SS risk allele of rs10774671 has been shown by others to be associated with
reduced OAS1 enzymatic activity and ability to clear viral infections, as well as
reduced responsiveness to IFN treatment. Our results establish OAS1 as a risk
locus for SS and support a potential role for defective viral clearance due to
altered IFN response as a genetic pathophysiological basis of this complex
autoimmune disease.
