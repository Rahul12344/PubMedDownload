OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of congenital
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in pregnant women at the end of pregnancy in
Kuwait using cord blood and maternal urine.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples were collected prior to childbirth, and cord 
blood was collected immediately after delivery from 983 women. Anti-CMV IgG and
IgM antibodies were determined using ELISA; CMV DNA was detected using nested
PCR, and viral load was calculated using real-time PCR. CMV concentration in
samples was categorized as low when the viral load ≤10(3) copies/µl, intermediate
when the viral load = 10(3)-10(4) copies/µl, and high when the viral load >10(4) 
copies/µl. The cord blood serology outcome was compared to cord blood PCR, cord
blood viral load, maternal urine PCR and viral load analyses.
RESULTS: Serology showed that of the 983 cord blood samples, 89 (9%) were
positive for anti-CMV IgM antibodies; PCR test showed 44 (4.5%) contained CMV
DNA, and there was a high viral load in all. Maternal urine PCR showed that 9
(10.11%) women had CMV DNA, and there was a high viral load in 7 (78%). The kappa
test for measures of agreement showed a reasonable agreement (0.45) between cord 
blood PCR and urine PCR.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that CMV infection in the cord blood sera of
pregnant women is common in Kuwait and highlights the need for more clinically
based studies to follow up newborns with congenital CMV infection.
