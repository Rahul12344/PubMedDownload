Diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is usually based on the
clinical presentation, on the demonstration of the brain lesions at the magnetic 
resonance imaging examination, and on the detection of the JC virus DNA in the
cerebrospinal fluid with high sensitive polymerase chain reaction. The role of
magnetic resonance imaging specifically in natalizumab-associated progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy is strengthening, and it is gaining importance not
only as an irreplaceable diagnostic tool but also as a surveillance and risk
stratifying tool in treated patients. While other imaging techniques such as
computed tomography lack sensitivity and specificity, magnetic resonance
performed with morphological and functional sequences offers clinicians the
possibility to early identify the stage of the disease and the emergence of an
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome after natalizumab blood removal
plasmapheresis.
