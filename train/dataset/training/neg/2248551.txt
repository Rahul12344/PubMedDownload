Ten virus-specific polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from approximately
200k to 11k were identified in bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV-)infected
cells. Time course analysis of the induction of the viral polypeptides indicated 
that they could be detected as early as 30 min post-infection and their synthesis
reached a plateau 12 h after infection. Cell free translation of total
infected-cell mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte system yielded 7 proteins
corresponding in size to virus-specific proteins synthesized in BRSV-infected
cells. The P protein was highly phosphorylated; G and F were identified as
glycoproteins by [3H]glucosamine labeling. Glycosylation of G protein was largely
resistant to tunicamycin, suggesting that the majority of the carbohydrate
residues are attached via O-glycosidic bonds, whereas the F protein was N-linked 
glycosylated. Tunicamycin caused a drastic reduction in the yield of infectious
virus titer indicating that the carbohydrate moieties serve a critical role in
the infectious cycle of BRSV.
