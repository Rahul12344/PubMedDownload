Genetic modifications of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat proteins allow for
an increase in the selective deposition and controlled growth of different metals
onto the surface of the virus, making it an ideal biotemplate for metal nanowire 
formation. In the current process, TMV2Cys is coated sequentially with multiple
uniform layers of palladium metal in aqueous solution under very mild conditions.
Palladium nanowires of 300 nm in length and 30-40 nm in diameter have been
created with this process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) are used to characterize the thickness and uniformity of 
the metal surface. The TEM and SAXS results confirm that the final thickness of
the palladium nanowires is controllable by varying the number of coating layers
or the initial palladium concentration.
