Interaction of reovirus with cell surface receptors. III. Reovirus type 3 induces
capping of viral receptors on murine lymphocytes.

Epstein RL, Powers ML, Weiner HL.

We have previously shown that there are receptors for the hemagglutinin of
reovirus type 3 on a subset of both murine T and B cells. Using purified reovirus
type 3 particles as a ligand, followed by FITC-labeled antiviral antibody we have
now been able to demonstrate viral induced capping of the reovirus receptor on
both B and T cells. Kinetic studies and inhibition experiments using cytochalasin
B and colchicine demonstrate that reovirus-induced capping of the viral receptor 
on both B and T cells has characteristics identical to the capping of
immunoglobulin on B cells by anti-immunoglobulin reagents. Removal of the viral
receptor and reexpression after overnight culture was demonstrated after membrane
treatment by proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pronase) or after viral induced
modulation of receptor. Protein synthesis was required for reexpression since
cyclohexamide prevented the reexpression of receptor in culture. Co-capping
studies utilizing 2-color immunofluorescence failed to identify and association
between the reovirus receptor and a variety of known surface structures on either
B or T cells, but demonstrated independent modulation of the viral receptor from 
other surface structures. These studies suggest that the lymphocyte surface
binding site for reovirus type 3 is a distinct structure that behaves identically
in capping studies of both B and T cells, is protein in nature, and is intimately
linked to the cell cytoskeleton.
