Ultrastructural studies of the development of feline calicivirus in a feline
embryo cell line.

Studdert MJ, O'Shea JD.

The ultrastructural changes in a feline embryo continuous cell line infected with
feline calicivirus at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 1 were
studied. Virus was found only in the cytoplasm and was observed as single
particles, as extensive, non-regular accumulations, as paracrystalline arrays,
and as single or multiple linear arrays associated with microfbrils. Mature virus
particles were readily distinguished from ribosomes in that they were larger
(35nm diameter) and consisted of a central, electron-dense core 20 nm diameter
surrounded by a less electron-dense coat. Other changes ovserved in infected
cells included rounding of the cell and nucleus and loss of pseudopodia. There
was extensive production of smooth-membrane bound vesicles in the cytoplasm.
Virus accumulations of each type, but especially paracrystalline arrays, were
frequently closely associated with collections of these vesicles. The cisternae
of the endoplasmic reticulum and the space between the two layers of the nuclear 
membrane was distended. By Feulgen staining and light microscopy, as well as
electron microscopy, it was established that nuclear chromatin undergoes profound
changes consisting of condensation usually into a single, rounded, central mass.
