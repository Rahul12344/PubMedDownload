There are few studies directly comparing the efficacy and safety of telbivudine
and entecavir. The present prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the
long-term efficacy and safety of these compounds in 196 hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg)-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B for a median follow-up period 
of 172 weeks; 97 were treated with telbivudine and 99 were treated with
entecavir. Patients showing suboptimal responses could also take adefovir at
24-48 weeks and all patients with viral breakthrough were started on adefovir.
The 240-week cumulative proportions of patients showing undetectable hepatitis B 
DNA levels and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) normalization were similar in the
two study groups. Viral breakthrough developed in 14% of the telbivudine group
and in 2% of the entecavir group (p 0.002). Interestingly, the cumulative
proportions of patients treated with entecavir and telbivudine showing HBeAg
seroconversion were 12% versus 21% at 48 weeks (p 0.041), 15% versus 38% at 96
weeks (p 0.001), 24% versus 50% at 144 weeks (p 0.001), 33% versus 53% at 192
weeks (p 0.004) and 36% versus 53% at 240 weeks (p 0.005), respectively. Patients
treated with telbivudine were therefore significantly more likely to show HBeAg
seroconversion than those receiving entecavir and similar results were observed
in study sub-groups matched for age, serum ALT, and HBV DNA levels. A safety
analysis identified no differences between grade 3/4 creatine kinase elevations
in the study groups and only telbivudine was associated with improved kidney
function.
