Bovine viral diarrhea virus: purification of surface proteins in
detergent-containing buffers by fast protein liquid chromatography.

Kårsnäs P, Moreno-Lopez J, Kristiansen T.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus was purified by lectin chromatography. The
glycoprotein peplomers were dissociated from the virion by treatment with
detergent. By a second lectin gel chromatography the glycoconjugates containing
terminal galactose were prepared. In combination with lectin affinity
chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography on Mono-Q in the presence of the
low-UV-absorbing detergent Berol 172 proved to be a powerful technique both for
analytical and preparative applications.
