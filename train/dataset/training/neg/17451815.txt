The World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties,
OIE) includes the diseases caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), swine
vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as
"Diseases Notifiable to the OIE". Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks have
severe economical as well as social effects and cannot be differentiated from the
diseases caused by the other two viruses on the basis of clinical symptoms.
Efficient laboratory techniques are therefore required for detection and
identification of the viruses causing similar vesicular symptoms in swine. A
rapid method is described using padlock probes and microarrays to detect
simultaneously and differentiate the three viruses in a single reaction, as well 
as providing serotype information in cases of VSV infection. The padlock
probe/microarray assay detected successfully and identified 39 cDNA samples of
different origin representing the three viruses. The results were in complete
agreement with identities and serotypes determined previously. This novel virus
detection method is discussed in terms of usefulness and further development.
