Correlation of the chemical structure of 4-nitroquinolines inactivating human
cytomegalovirus and established in vivo carcinogenicity tests.

Inactivation of the infectivity of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex
virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) has been observed following exposure to
4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO) or its metabolite, 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide
(HAQO). The present study of the specificity of the chemical structure of
4-nitroquinolines demonstrated that both the 4-nitro and 1-oxide groups were
required for inactivation of virus infectivity. Reduction of the 4-nitro group to
a 4-hydroxyamino group enhanced activity, while further reduction to an amino
group resulted in loss of activity against virus infectivity. The capacity to
inactivate virus was also lost by substitution of the pyridine ring for the
quinoline nucleus of NQO. The relationship between the chemical structure and the
ability to inactivate viruses studied here correlates well with earlier in vivo
carcinogenicity studies of the same group of chemicals.
