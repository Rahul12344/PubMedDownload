OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential contribution of the thymus to CD4+
T-lymphocyte increases in HIV-infected patients receiving intermittent
interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy.
DESIGN: Fifteen HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens who
were enrolled in a study of intermittent IL-2 therapy and were willing to undergo
serial thymic computed tomography (CT) were prospectively studied.
METHODS: Thymic CT was performed before and approximately 6 and 12-17 months
after intermittent IL-2 therapy was started. Scans were graded in a blinded
manner. Changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in CD4+ T lymphocytes occurred with 
IL-2 administration, with a preferential increase in naive relative to memory
CD4+ T cells. Despite this increase in naive CD4+ T cells, overall there was a
modest decrease in thymic volume observed during the study period. No correlation
was found between changes in thymic volume indices and total, naive, or memory
CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the profound CD4+ T-lymphocyte
increases seen with intermittent IL-2 administration are not associated with
increases in thymic volume and more likely are due to peripheral expansion rather
than increased thymic output.
