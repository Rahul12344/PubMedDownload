INTRODUCTION: HIV infection and certain antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications 
increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, mediated, in part, through 
traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied cardiovascular disease risk factor changes in the
START (Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment) trial, a randomized study of
immediate versus deferred ART initiation among HIV-positive persons with CD4+
cell counts >500 cells/mm3. Mean change from baseline in risk factors and the
incidence of comorbid conditions were compared between groups. The
characteristics among 4685 HIV-positive START trial participants include a median
age of 36 years, a CD4 cell count of 651 cells/mm3, an HIV viral load of
12 759 copies/mL, a current smoking status of 32%, a median systolic/diastolic
blood pressure of 120/76 mm Hg, and median levels of total cholesterol of
168 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 102 mg/dL, and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol of 41 mg/dL. Mean follow-up was 3.0 years. The immediate 
and deferred ART groups spent 94% and 28% of follow-up time taking ART,
respectively. Compared with patients in the deferral group, patients in the
immediate ART group had increased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and higher use of lipid-lowering therapy (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.1-2.2).
Concurrent increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with immediate ART
resulted in a 0.1 lower total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
ratio (95% CI, 0.1-0.2). Immediate ART resulted in 2.3% less BP-lowering therapy 
use (95% CI, 0.9-3.6), but there were no differences in new-onset hypertension or
diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-positive persons with preserved immunity, immediate ART
led to increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but
also concurrent increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased
use of blood pressure medications. These opposing effects suggest that, in the
short term, the net effect of early ART on traditional cardiovascular disease
risk factors may be clinically insignificant."
