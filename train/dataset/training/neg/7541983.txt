From two independent fusions, fifteen MAbs directed to the F protein of the
bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were characterized by
radio-immunoprecipitation assays. Competition binding assays among these MAbs
identified two distinct antigenic sites (A and B) and one overlapping site (AB). 
All of the MAbs specific to epitopes belonging to site A neutralized the
infectivity of the virus in vitro and recognized human and bovine RSV strains.
Only two out of the five MAbs directed to epitopes of site B were neutralizing
and three reacted with all of the RSV strains tested, suggesting that the
epitopes constituting this domain present heterogeneous characteristics. In each 
of sites A and B, one of the neutralizing MAbs also inhibited cell fusion. The
biological relevance of these domains was established by competing representative
MAbs and sera from BRSV-infected calves.
