Severe flooding, which is associated with numerous outbreaks of a wide range of
infectious diseases, particularly those caused by enteric viruses, occurred in
all areas of Thailand in 2011. To determine the prevalence of five human enteric 
viruses, namely enterovirus, rotavirus (RV), norovirus (NV), hepatitis A virus
(HAV), and hepatitis E virus, in the flood water, 100 water samples were
collected from flood-damaged areas in central Thailand. Viral RNA was extracted
from concentrated samples and analyzed by RT-PCR and sequencing. NV was the most 
commonly detected pathogen in the tested samples (14%). RV and HAV were detected 
in 9% and 7% of samples, respectively. This study is the first to detect enteric 
viral genes in flood water in Thailand. Furthermore, it is the first to detect an
NV gene in any type of environmental water in Thailand. These results provide
useful information for estimating the risk of flood waterborne viral infection.
