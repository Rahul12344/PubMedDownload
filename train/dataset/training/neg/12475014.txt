A growing number of patients with pelvic organ dysfunction and failing response
to standard treatment concepts are referred to special neuro-urology services.
New therapeutic options are available, such as unilateral and bilateral sacral
nerve stimulation, and the use of different neurotoxins for the overactive
bladder. However, a lack of knowledge and understanding in central innervation
and modulation of pelvic organ function prevents a striking progress in this
clinical area. A concept of efferent innervation of pelvic organs based on
experimental animal studies, using the retrograde, transneuronal and
self-amplifying tracer Pseudorabiesvirus, is discussed in a clinical context.
