Cidofovir is a deoxycytidine monophosphate analog with broad spectrum activity
against various deoxyribonucleic acid viruses. Cidofovir is marketed as an
injectable for intravenous use; however, there is a topical cidofovir formulation
utilized for viral dermatologic infections. Here, we present a case of a
successful clearance of a perianal acyclovir resistant and foscarnet refractory
herpes simplex virus (HSV1) ulcer in a 34 year-old woman who had undergone
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After 1 week of therapy with 
cidofovir gel, the patient's ulcer was clinically improved, and the lesion was
negative for herpes simplex virus transcripts by real-time polymerase chain
reaction testing. The wound remained herpes simplex virus negative by real-time
polymerase chain reaction on repeat testing 1 week later. Based on this and other
reports in HIV/AIDS patients, we believe that cidofovir gel has utility in the
management of cutaneous, acyclovir-resistant HSV infections.
