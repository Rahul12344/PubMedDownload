SETTING: Urban clinic, Nairobi.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of specimen quality and different
smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) case (SPC) definitions on SPC detection by sex.
DESIGN: Prospective study among TB suspects.
RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were recruited: 644 produced > or =1 specimen
for microscopy. The male/female sex ratio was 0.8. There were no significant
differences in numbers of men and women submitting three specimens (274/314 vs.
339/380, P = 0.43). Significantly more men than women produced a set of three
'good' quality specimens (175/274 vs. 182/339, P = 0.01). Lowering thresholds for
definitions to include scanty smears resulted in increases in SPC detection in
both sexes; the increase was significantly higher for women. The revised World
Health Organization (WHO) case definition was associated with the highest
detection rates in women. When analysis was restricted only to patients
submitting 'good' quality specimen sets, the difference in detection between
sexes was on the threshold for significance (P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher SPC notification rates in men are commonly reported by TB
control programmes. The revised WHO SPC definition may reduce sex disparities in 
notification. This should be considered when evaluating other interventions aimed
at reducing these. Further study is required on the effects of the human
immuno-deficiency virus and instructed specimen collection on sex-specific impact
of new SPC definition.
