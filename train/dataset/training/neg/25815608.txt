Molecular dynamics simulation of an atom-resolved bacteriophage P22 capsid model 
is used to delineate the underlying mechanism of early stage P22 self-assembly. A
dimer formed by the C-terminal fragment of scaffolding protein with a new
conformation is demonstrated to catalyze capsomer (hexamer and pentamer)
aggregation efficiently. Effects of scaffolding protein/coat protein binding
patterns and scaffolding protein concentration on efficiency, fidelity, and
capsid curvature of P22 self-assembly are identified.
