Human antibodies specific for digoxigenin, estradiol, testosterone and
progesterone have been isolated from a small combinatorial IgM repertoire (4 x
10(7)) of single chain antibodies (scFv). The affinities of both the
anti-estradiol and antiprogesterone scFv were approximately 10(8) M(-1). Naive
IgM genes appeared to be highly represented, since only the heavy chain variable 
domain of the anti estradiol antibody contained differences to corresponding
germline sequences. The light chain variable domain of the progesterone receptor 
was also identical to a germline sequence, showing that it is possible for
completely naive antibodies to bind steroids with affinities comparable to those 
obtained after a secondary immune response.
