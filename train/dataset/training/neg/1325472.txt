Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for a primary infection (varicella)
and, upon reactivation, zoster, which in immunocompromised patients, may both
lead to life-threatening disseminated disease. There is a great need for
antiviral compounds that are effective inhibitors of VZV replication and for
rapid and accurate methods for evaluating viral sensitivity to candidate anti-VZV
drugs. With the monoclonal antibody (mAb) (VL8), which is directed against the
gpI of VZV, and using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) we could
readily demonstrate expression of the VZV gpI antigen at 3-4 days after VZV
infection. (E)-5-(2-Bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU),
(S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (HPMPA) and
(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (HPMC) were shown to be
potent inhibitors of VZV replication by this assay. HPMPA and HPMPC were also
active against thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) VZV whereas BVDU was not. The
flow cytometric method based on the use of mAb VL8 may be of considerable help
for the early diagnosis of VZV infection and evaluation of viral sensitivity to
antiviral drugs.
