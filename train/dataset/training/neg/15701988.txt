Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection and herpes zoster are important
infectious complications after an allogeneic hemopoietic progenitors transplant
(HPT). The authors describe a girl with second relapse of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia who received an HPT at age 13 years. Two years after the HPT she started
a revaccination program of routine childhood vaccines. With each course of
vaccines she developed herpes zoster of the C6 dermatome, initially with the rash
and later zoster sine herpete. The vaccinations appear to have triggered VZV
reactivation by vaccine-induced immunomodulation in this HPT recipient.
